It's been a year since we've gone to Lotus of Siam and we are STILL talking about it. This made our trip to Vegas and we want to go back just to eat here. Fellow foodies, I know you get it. We had the bass drunken noodles (DROOL), crispy garlic shrimp (OMG YES) and a few other items I don't remember the names of. Everything was so good!

I would highly recommend you check this place out and so you're not stuck waiting, make a couple of reservations so you can go back more than once if you're visiting Vegas.",0,0,0

I am back from my latest jaunt to Viva and finally had a chance to dine at LOS.  We went during lunch.  At first I wanted to try the buffet, but thought better of trying the authentic Thai that I've always wanted to try.  Besides, the buffet had limited traditional dishes that I could get at Panda Express.

No, I wanted the real deal.  And I got it.  To start, we had the Beef Satay.  The peanut sauce was awesome, a bit spicy and flavorful.  The cucumber salad was crunchy and fresh.  Then the spicy chicken wings.  Why?  Why can I never make these at home?  The sweet-spicy garlic chile sauce was great and the wing itself was crunchy and hot.  Just like it is supposed to be.  I could have made a meal from that alone.

On to the entrees:

MEE KROB RAD NA-Crispy egg noodle topped with straw
mushroom, vegetable and gravy. I had it with chicken and it was so good.  even when I pushed it aside, I was still eating from the bowl.

MOO YANG-Marinated charbroiled pork, served with spicy sauce.  Without the spicy sauce, it was a star.  With the sauce, it rang out with high notes.

The service was attentive and warm.  I absolutely enjoyed the experience and will return.  Don't let the area deter you from this gem.",0,0,0

We got there before they opened the doors for dinner service since we couldn't get a reservation.  There was already a line 25 people deep when we arrived.  10 minutes before a hostess came out and wrote down everyone's party size and it only took about 10 mintures to get our party of five seated after the doors opened.  Our family usually orders too much food, so we always go home with left overs.  Not this time!  We ate every single thing on the table.  I'm pretty sure if it was socially acceptable, I would have licked the plates. We ordered the Tom Yum Prawn Soup, Panang Curry with Chicken, Garlic Prawns, Khao Soi Braised Short Ribs, Sea Bass with Gnger, Crispy Duck with Chili Mint Leaves.  Everything was so delicious and perfectly prepared.  This is the kind of plance where I wouldn't mind trying something totally out of the box because I'm confident no matter how weird it was, it would be amazing!  So I'm giving this place 5 stars.

My friend's first impression was to GTFO of this parking lot and eat in our hotel where there are plenty of lights and people which ""guaranteed"" safety lol. But in the end, we went in and ate.

The first thing I've noticed were the numerous pictures of celebrity chefs and celebrities along the wall including chefs as such Ming Tsai and even that Andrew zimmern from Travel Channel.  With that in mind and the popular reviews on yelp this place have to be good, then again Mr. zimmern eats anything and everything. We were told the wait was 1 hour and we were willing to wait. 

As my two friends and I were waiting, one of them got so hungry from the thought that he was not able to eat within the hour he went to the next door Indian restaurant to eat a small meal lol.

The wait was NOT an hour, it was around 30 minutes. We got the crispy duck and two more dishes which I have forgotten the names but everything was LEGIT TO THE MAX. One of the dishes was some sort of braised beef in a curry sauce.

I have to say, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be, or as my friends were. We ordered dishes that Anthony ordered and I thought they were just ok. Nothing impressed me as much as the garlic prawns, which we ordered a second helping of because they were so good. 

The dishes from the show were from the Northern section of the menu. The Khao Soi with pork was pretty good and had pork with vegetables in a curry sauce with coconut milk and noodles. We also ordered the Nam Prik Ong, which is a pork and tomato mixture served with fresh veggies and pork rinds for dipping. That was quite tasty. 

I just thought, that many of the thai places I've eaten at in San Diego and LA, were better than this. Maybe this is considered really good for Las Vegas? 

You could see a lot of people arriving in taxis and I even asked one of them if they had seen the show and they said yes. Bourdain has a LOT of influence on people, that's for sure. But this foodie was only mildly impressed.",3,1,1

And this is coming from a girl who has been to the ""good Thai places"" in Hollywood aka Thai-town. I have to say at first I was skeptical because the exterior looked like the run down part of downtown LV but all that changes once you step inside the restaurant...what Thai restaurant has a glass wine cellar? The wait (good sign) was about 30 min: long enuff for us to look over the menu to decide what we wanted to try. When we saw what was brought out to other tables, the food looked so good that we had to change what we were going to order to what we saw! We were definitely getting more excited as the time drew nearer...
I know that at Asian restaurants, a bunch of white people is usually not a good sign because that means that the food might not be authentic and made ""Americanized"". It was a packed house with about 50% white folks.. Got me a lil worried, but boy this time, the white folks must've known something the Asian population wasn't aware of... Rundown of our dishes:
1) Tom Kum kah: coconut soup. Was ok. Nothing special.
2) Garlic prawns: highlight of the evening. The seasoning was the perfect balance of salt, garlic, and pepper. The exact seasoning you would expect if you order Chinese style stir fried garlic crabs. The most surprising part of the dish was how it was prepared: with the prawn shelled but with the shell semi- attached at the tail. First, you eat the perfectly seasoned prawn. Then, you got to enjoy the bonus: the crispy prawn shell. Biting into the shell was like biting into a crispier version of chicharron ( crispy pig skin). I have never seen prawn prepared this way. WHY hasn't any other chef\/ restaurant ever thought of that?!!! Lotus of Siam, thank you for this ingenious foresight......

3) crispy duck in panang curry: we had originally planned to order the crispy duck with Chili n mint leaves, but our waiter suggested we order this version since we already had a similarly flavored dish. What great knowledge of the staff to provide helpful tips! He was dead on to make this suggestion. My friend krystal kept raving about the sauce. I think if she was not in public, she may have licked the plate!! LoL!!!

4) drunken noodle with sea bass: at first we contemplated ordering this dish.. It was the most expensive thing we ordered at $30, but we were sold when a patron leaving the restaurant overheard our discussion and urged us to order it saying it was ""the reason why we come here"". With a reference put that way, we needed no further convincing! The sea bass was extremely fresh n flaky. The drunken noodles were perfectly wok'd: you could taste the ""fire"" of the wok. A sign that the wok has been well seasoned and the chef knows how to use that to intensify the foods being cooked in it. Awesome dish!

Alas, we were too full to order dessert but the fried bananas with ice cream looked so good that we'll have to come back next time to try it. Oh YES, there will definitely be a NEXT time.. :)

Total for our party of 4: $103. Not bad at all.. I'd come here any day over a buffet!!",1,1,2

We had reservations at Lotus on a Thursday at 8:00 pm.  As many Yelpers note, it's in a non-descript shopping center on East Sahara.  When we opened the door the place was jumping.  It's large, with seating throughout the restaurant.  Despite the crowd we were seated immediately, even a couple of minutes before our reservation.  A man who wasn't our server but we saw several times during the evening took our drink order.  He brought us our water as well as a bottle of wine.  The Lotus wine list isn't enormous, but it's diverse enough for the majority of wine drinkers.  There are a few options by the glass and very reasonably priced bottles.  I think I've become jaded by Strip pricing when it comes to wines by the bottle.  But, there aren't any unknown gems or incredible wines on the list, but you will likely find something you like for far less than you'd pay elsewhere.

The menu was overwhelming to us.  Daunting, even.  So, we asked our server what dishes he recommended we try on our first visit.  For appetizers, we had the crispy rice and crispy garlic black pepper chicken wings.  For the spice level on the rice, we requested a 6\/10.  When the dish arrived and we tried it, it was incredibly hot.  We should have calibrated our request for Thai cuisine, we were expecting a different level of heat to say the least.  But, the dish was fantastic, very crispy and flavorful with the cubes of sausage and green onions.  I'd order this dish again at a 6\/10, I would just prepare myself for the heat.  The garlic pepper wings were pretty standard, very crispy skin and flavorful.  But, the appetizer winner for me was the crispy rice.

For dinner, we split:  the drunken noodle sea bass, garlic prawns, crispy duck with curry cause, and a beef dish that I can't remember the name.  It had a bunch of veggies and a spicy sauce, I know that.  My favorites were, in order:  the duck, the sea bass, the prawns, the beef.  The crispy duck was tender with a very crispy skin, impressive given it was coated in sauce.  The sauce, by the way, was probably the best curry I've had.  I could come to Lotus and only get this dish and leave happy.

The sea bass had flavorful noodles along with a tender and flaky sea bass.  Excellent fish.  The fried prawns were very crispy and the garlic sauce is fantastic.  i could have used more of it.  The beef was good, but it paled in comparison to the other dishes.  

For dessert, we tried fried bananas, which were good, but not very sweet.  But, I didn't come to Lotus for the dessert, so it wasn't a huge deal that I didn't love it.

Be advised that the dishes come out very fast.  It won't take you long to have a meal.  Very glad I finally tried this Las Vegas institution and will likely be back on future trips.  Its lofty reputation is well-deserved.",1,0,1

We came with no reservations, and the hostess took our phone number so we could either go to the bar or leave during the 45 min wait. We walked around the ""Around the World"" strip mall and eventually got our call. (We call it that because you have Thai, Korean, American and Mexican themed restaurants and businesses all in one place). 

The waiter was probably what really made this place special. He had a great grasp on the extensive wine list (We ordered a bottle, and he confirmed to see if we knew what it was we were ordering...we did, but nice that he checked) and gave great recommendations so we could share dishes and have everything still pair nicely with the German Riesling. My wife had the Panang Curry (at an 8 spicy level, which she said was perfect) with noodles and I had the crispy duck with chili mint leaves. The noodles made for a messy meal, because the curry splashed around as my wife and I ate the noodles. The crispy duck was something I've been craving ever since, and may be in one of my top 5 meals ever.

The food came quickly, and our waiter was always nearby if we needed anything. He also came and brought a bucket of ice for our wine - something unexpected at a Thai restaurant. When I ordered the mango with sweet sticky rice (a staple at most Thai places), I was pleased when he advised against it due to the mangoes not being fully ripe.

Located in a near-abandoned strip mall off the strip, my boyfriend and I got here for an early dinner at 5:15pm (they open at 5:30pm) and were very impressed that there was already a sizable line forming along the outside. We had high expectations, and Lotus of Siam did not disappoint.

We tried:
- Crispy duck with panang ($20.95) - SO GOOOOD, I'M STILL DREAMING OF IT! I adore panang curry, and it is seriously done right here! We ordered mild because my boyfriend doesn't eat spicy, but it still came out a bit spicy. But even he LOVED this. While the crispy duck was delicious, I felt it was a little bit heavy for me with all the oil\/frying. Next time, I would order this as the panang curry with beef or chicken ($10.95) and save myself the ten bucks.
- Crab Fried Rice ($12.95) - So delicious and flavorful. No skimping on crab whatsoever! Would order again forsure.
- Drunken Noodle Prawn ($22.95)- My least favorite dish of the night. I felt the large, flat noodles were bland. However, the prawn was crisp and plentiful. Instead, next time I'll try the Garlic Prawn ($21.95) instead.

Our waiter was extremely friendly, knowledgable and helpful. My boyfriend and I had no idea what kind of wine we wanted (they have a HUGE selection!), but he asked us a few questions and brought us out each a glass perfectly suited to our individual tastes.

I thought they were delicious but I would have thought\/liked if they came with some kind of lime\/chile dipping sauce. Also had the Isaan sausage which was very good. The nam prik noon was awesome, though I would have liked to see more fried pork skins for dipping. The seabass over the papaya salad was also really good. The seabass was cooked to perfection. The papaya salad was a bit sweet for my liking but complemented the seabags nicely and tasted extremely fresh. Also tried the That iced tea, which I thought was good because it was not too sweet.

Many have said this was the Best Thai in the continental USA and I think they're right!  I was in Vegas for a week and we visited this place 3 times.  Loved it.

All my favorite dishes were found under the Chef Choices section of their menu.  My top favorite dish was the deep-fried prawns with shell with pepper in special garlic sauce.  We tried both versions of the deep-fried prawns but garlic was hands-down easily the best (the other was just okay).  

We also ordered a Whole 2-pound CharGrilled Catfish in our 2nd visit.  It was yummy but we agreed we wouldn't order this version again.  First, it takes 45 mins. to prepare (which we were told, of course).  Second, the catfish skin was a bit too well-done (burnt) for our tastes (and we like BBQ).  The cooked catfish meat was very good and it was worth trying.  We'll probably try another cooked version of  whole catfish next time we're here, visiting Vegas.

I also recommend the Chilean Sea Bass, the Crab Fried Rice and their Drunken Noodle with whatever [insert meat of preference].  

The Chilean Sea Bass was also excellent but I've had equally good sea bass for less in price.  Not a super value dish but the quality was excellent.  The crab fried rice was also excellent.   We had crispy duck w\/ drunken noodle and it was good, not spectacular (since being asian, I've had quite a lot of duck).  

Choose the spice level of your food to suit your preference.  I don't tend to go too spicy and since I have a fairly low spicy tolerance level, we usually choose Level 2.  We tried Level 4 and it was too hot for me halfway into the second serving.  For those who like it spicy, just ignore my warning and go for whatever rocks your socks!

Don't get the duck addon for anything. The bill came and my friend was shocked that his portion was around $30 dollars. The waiter mistook him for wanting the dish with duck and wrote down ""crispy duck addon"" instead. Of course the ""preparation"" of frying the duck cost an additional $10 dollars, but of course the waiter did not know how much extra it would cost, and didn't think of asking a manager or something.

lotus of siam recommended by fellow yelper jim c.

someone orders level 5, another orders level 10.

i can't handle spicy food, but i brave this one and try the level 5 with a big spoonful of rice. 2 seconds of chewing and my mouth is doused with gasoline and set on fire. 15 seconds later, i get an instant nose bleed.

thank god i didn't try the level 10.

i wish to the fucking black lord that i could give negative stars... or even zero stars, but yelp forces you to give at least one, so that one star will go to #109 on the menu. the ""boat noodle soup"" that was fucking delicious... anyway... 

so while were waiting to get seated we hung out at the bar to get some refreshments. i ask the waitress what their ""thai lime drink"" was and she responds, ""it's a thai lime squeeze"". uhm okay, i understand there's a language barrier, so i ask waitress #2 and she explains to me that its kind of like a limeade except its not fresh squeezed and they use concentrate instead. im like cool, okay. we get seated a couple minutes later and waitress #2 ends up being our server and asks what we would like to drink. we order a round of waters and i ask for the thai lime drink andthis bitchhhhhh says ""oh we're actually out of that"". .......... ....... okay so uhmmm how come you didnt fucking mention that when i fucking asked you earlier what the fuck the drink was made of???!???!?!!! so then im like, okay how about thai tea? and she goes, oh were out of that too.... at this point, im trying to keep the frustration off my face and i say ""are you out of regular iced tea?"" and she says no, so im like okay thats what ill get.

they bring the drinks out and explain that their kitchen is closing in a few minutes so we need to place our orders. we order the boat noodle soup, crab fried rice, pad thai, wonton soup, crispy duck panang, crispy duck khao soi, garlic prawns, and crispy duck drunken noodles x2 (chefs recommendation btw).

as were waiting for our food we notice that the tables around us that arrived after us are starting to receive their food first... were like okay, maybe its because we had a big order, nbd. 

twenty minutes later they bring out our rice, boat noodle soup, wonton soup, pad thai, & garlic prawns. we start to eat, so far so good, delicious.

ten more minutes pass by.

then twenty.

then my boyfriend when to to go poop and when he came back he was like ""our food's still not ready?!""

finally he goes to ask our waiter...

our fucking waiter... this is what he says... ""oh i just found out our kitchen is out of duck.""

what.

what.

you're fucking joking right? 

hahahahahahhahahahaha -me at that moment.

at what point.... at what fucking point were you going to relay that message to us???? were you just going to let us sit there??? what if we had never asked about the rest of our food??? we couldn't even choose anything else off the menu because we had heen waiting so long that their fucking kitchen was closed.

clearly we were upset and we were letting them have it, and their response was ""we're so sorry, would you like a free dessert?""

hell the fuck no! why would we want dessert when we came here for dinner and obviously didn't get to eat dinner????! stupid mother fuckers.

no. no no no thats it, we've been here long enough, give us our bill.

get this guys, the bill was fucking wrong. they tried to charge us for thai tea and a coke. when the hell did we even order a coke during all of this? and why would you charge us for a thai tea that you said you're out of???!

ughhhhh im about to get an aneurysm while typing this. 

long story short, they didnt compensate us for anything and we didnt tip them shit.

The other plate, I believe no. 55, was strips of rubbery beef in a acidic and vile sauce.  Terrible to say the least.  

Im hardly ever motivated to write reviews on food spots and hate being negative about things but maybe I can save a few souls from spending their hard earned money on sub par Thai food.",2,2,0

- The appetizers were by far the best part of the meal. 
- The tom kha was the BEST tom kha I've ever had, and that is the dish by which I judge every Thai restaurant (because it's my fav).
- The main dishes were a bit anticlimactic. The menu descriptions were far more exciting than the actual product - bland, with not very many ingredients (e.g. a dish that promised pineapple had literally 2 pieces of pineapple in it).

位於賭城一個距離主街大道比較偏遠的商場中，從餐廳外觀還看不太出有何端倪，但內行的食客們可不陌生，附近還有許多知名的美食。

將泰式料理推廣到世界各地的名廚，受到泰皇的接見與嘉勉，在世界上各地的泰式料理廚師能獲得此殊榮，更加讓人期待其料理風味。

從美國全國到地方、從美國本土到國際性，各大媒體的推崇與介紹，以及許多與飲食相關的機構頒發的獎章與認證，密密麻麻地貼在餐廳入口的牆壁上，在品嚐料理風味之前就已經帶來相當的震撼。

受到全美推崇的泰國名廚料理，也吸引了來自四面八方、包括名人的顧客們前來朝聖，四周的牆上掛滿了各個活動的照片。

從餐廳外觀看起來很難想像裡頭的用餐空間是如此寬敞明亮，甚至是有完整的吧台設置，讓顧客很舒服地來享受餐點。

位於餐廳一角的儲酒空間設置，應該是在泰式餐廳前所未有的規模，也呼應著賭城特有的風情。

這裡的菜單應該是查理造訪過得泰式餐廳中內容數一數二豐富的，豐富的品項與各式餐點，囊括了許多大家耳熟能詳的泰式菜色，建議在造訪前先計畫一下點餐的內容。

作為一間在賭城有著重要地位的餐廳，除了來自餐點的風味之外，佐餐的酒類也是有著風附的選擇，可以從酒單的豐富內容一窺全貌。

在泰式餐廳中所點用的沙拉類菜餚，絕對不是一般印象中那種以菜葉為主的一道菜色，幾乎是與蔬菜類食材一樣足量的牛肉，加上各種蔬菜帶來的豐富食感，以及來自酸香醬料的風味提點，吃來不僅是開胃暢快，更是一道美味的下飯菜。

蝦、蘑菇、魚露、蕃茄等食材，冬蔭功湯的口味雖然也相當厚重，但與重口味的菜餚搭配還是不錯得，但如果想要清涼一下的話，點用冰涼香甜的泰式奶茶，一口喝下暑意全消。

泰式的生蝦料理一直是查理本身相當喜愛、其它餐廳吃不到的特色風味餐點，這裡採用的蝦肉都是精心挑選過、再經過費工的處理保留蝦肉本身純淨的甜味與彈性，盛裝在盤子中就像是綻放的花朵一般，清新誘人。

搭配彈性十足的鮮美肉質，各種調味醬料也都是採用了在泰國當地會採用的食材來製作，作工費時、風味濃厚的蝦醬、薄荷葉、蒜片、兼具酸甜辣的醬汁，都是能幫蝦肉帶來不同食感的調味。

將各種醬料、配菜均勻地鋪放在蝦身上頭，大口地將整隻蝦子送入口中、充分地感受各種調料後與蝦肉混合在一起帶來的生猛韻味，甜、香、鹹、鮮，無比過癮。

來自椰奶與咖哩的香氣與滑順，讓原本滋味就相當充足的鴨肉多了一分細膩的食感。表皮還保有酥脆口感的鴨肉，裡頭的肉質也是軟嫩富有肉汁，在多種香料的襯托下其香氣更顯得充足，怪不得是在網路上受到熱烈推薦的一道菜色。

不同於以往傳統的泰式餐廳，無酒不歡再加上道地泰式風味的餐點完整呈現，多了一分來自於賭城當地特有的生活型態，絕對是一次讓人記憶深刻的用餐體驗。

一間比起主街上各家名廚助陣、星光閃閃的餐廳也絲毫不遜色的泰式風味餐廳，只來品嚐過一次是絕對不夠的，絕對是下回來到賭城會回訪的餐廳。",1,0,1

We were a party of 2 and I took the advice of other Yelpers and made reservations to avoid the infamous wait times. I've been wanting to eat here ever since the good prophet Mr. Anthony Bourdain sang its praises many seasons ago on his show. Northern Thai cuisine he said. He said go straight to the back of the menu where all these Northern specialties are found. That I did...

We were seated right when we walked in as I had told them we had reservations. We were seated near the wine room. First impression of Lotus of Siam was that it is big and it is busy. Very busy. Our reservations were for 8pm so there wasnt a big group of people waiting outside to be seated but there were some.

We ordered the khao soi crispy duck ($26.95) and the garlic prawns ($27.95) as suggested and urged by Anthony Bourdain. He was not lying. The duck is so crispy and delicious. That first bite was something else. Wowww.... Amazing. The egg noodles & perfectly crispy duck on top of that curry & coconut cream was a delicious combination. Now I know what the fuss is all about. So good... We also ordered the garlic prawns. They were crispy and deliciously fried still in their shell split in half. You have to get it. It was also so very good. Aside from those 2 dishes we just had white rice to accompany them and we were golden. That's all we needed. A glass of wine for the lady. A soda for me... Sa-tis-fied..

Service was decent. Felt a little rushed at first as we were total rookies but they warmed up after a while and turned out to be attentive and friendly. I cant wait to go back to Lotus of Siam the next time we're in town.

And you know what? It's not just them that recommend this place because famous chefs such as Jonathan Gold and Susan Feniger rave about this place as well. It's no wonder that they have been nominated for the James Beard award again and again. Just remember though that because this place is so good, you may want to call ahead and make a reservation unless you want to wait 45 minutes to an hour. 

Despite the swanky acclaim, let me warn you that the restaurant is way off the Strip and from the outside it looks like a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. In fact, Lotus of Siam is in the original Asian enclave of Las Vegas off of East Sahara Avenue near downtown so don't expect it to be glittery nice like the new Chinatown along Spring Mountain Road. Regardless, I like being in this rundown part of town because it reminds me of the old Las Vegas before all the dazzling excess when the best hotel in town was the Dunes.  

Lotus of Siam is a Thai restaurant, but its real specialty is Isan-style food. Isan is a region of Thailand that is located in the northeast portion of the country and is bordered by Cambodia and Laos. If only I had known when I was in Thailand because Isan-style cuisine is fucking delicious! 

Unlike traditional Thai food that people are probably accustomed to which is more sour and sweet, Isan-style cooking is more garlicky and spicy. The only way to describe the uniqueness of Isan-style Thai food is to compare it to the Peranakan ""nyonya"" cuisine  of Malaysia\/Singapore due to its blending of traditional Thai flavors with Cambodian and Laotian influences and to the Korean food from Cholla Province, due to its spicier and more pungent flavors.

So on Christmas Eve, our party of four ordered five dishes because the portions are a bit smaller than your normal Thai restaurant. We ended up ordering the standard noodle dishes of chicken pad thai and beef pad see ew as well as a really tangy papaya salad. I literally wanted to drink the papaya salad marinade because it was so fucking good. For the proteins we ordered moo yang (marinated charbroiled pork) and nua yum katiem (charbroiled beef marinated with garlic and hot sauce that is served on top of Thai cole claw). 

All the dishes were tasty, but my favorite was the Isan-style nua yum katiem. The beef had just the right amount of spicy flavors and mixed with the cole slaw, the combination was so good that I ended up drowning my rice in the sauce. 

At the end of the day, Lotus of Siam shines because it offers Isan-style Thai food. If you come here ordering just the normal Thai dishes, you may not enjoy this place for what it truly is. I will definitely will be returning. Sâep lai lai!",6,3,5

This is one of must stop place in Vegas for me, and t should be your's too!

2 things that I always order here:

1. Tom Yum Ka - a little bite of sourness with a little bit of heat; a perfect balance of what a soup should be.  The chicken and mushroom inside also complements each other perfectly. It's a light soup, not heavy at all, so perfect for any day.

2. Garlic Shrimp - cannot not find it any other Thai restaurants I've been to. It's basically fried shrimp with their secret seasoning. The shells are also fried until their extremely crispy, so you can actually eat it!  You MUST try this!

3rd item always depends on my mood.  This time, it's chripy duck with drunken noodle. If you ever had pad see you, it tastes like that with lots of basil. The fried duck is crispy and moist, yummmoooo.

I just had Thai food the other day and most of the time I don't like repeating similar types of food for at least a few days\/meals.. BUT Thai Noodle House left such a savory taste in my mouth that I wanted More!! BUT More from a new place, a place that so many people seem to worship! This place doesn't seem to lure in just us locals but also the rich and famous! I'm ready for Thai food Round 2:

What gave me a New Outlook on Thai Food:

Ground Chicken Larb: ground chicken with chopped onion, green chili, lime juice and fresh cabbage

- Tried this because it was recomended. Quite Fresh, Limey, Crunchy (cabbage) and Chicken was Good. And Most importantly Spicey!! for me at least.. We opted for 4\/10 (default, if you don't mention how spicy, you get thir medium hot which starts at 4 Not 5) on the heat scale and this already made me feel like a fire breathing dragon!! Don't be fooled, if your not into spicy you may want to order a 3 at most. For comparison: I've tried a 10\/10 heat scale at Pin Kaow and Thai BBQ.. The 4 here was hotter! 

Drunken Noodle Sliced Chicken: pan fried flat noodle, topped with sauteed chicken, fresh and dry chili, thai basil on a bed of greens

- My girl doesn't really eat seafood, so she substituted for chicken. I thought I've tried Great Thai flat noodle chicken dishes in the past but boy was I wrong! Chicken Tender and Very Tasty, Herbs and Spices (3\/10 heat) was just right and flat noodles couldn't be any better! 

Pad Se-Ew Sliced Pork: stir-fried flat rice noodle with egg, chinese broccoli and black soy sauce

- One of my favorite all time Thai dishes. I never tried a bad version of this dish but their pork here was better than any I've tried and again the flat noodles stood out themselves. 4\/10 heat scale but didn't seem to have as much heat as the Chicken Larb dish?.. Really Good for Pad Se-ew.

Drunken Noodle Halibut: deep fried halibut filet with homemade fresh chili and thai basil, over pan fried flat noodles

- Best Thai dish I've Ever Had.. Period. I don't know where to start.. The fish fillet had a nice breading, lightly fried and was flaky fresh. Their blend of chilis\/herbs\/spices blend were Unreal!!!! All on top of their pan fried flat noodles! By now you should know how I feel about their flat noodles! I ordered this at a 5\/10 thinking it wouldn't be too much heat but it was blazing! Next time I would order this at a 3 but it was So Magically Delicious,  it didn't matter!!

Thai Iced Tea:

- Great way to subside the heat from the food! Had a stronger flavor than usual.

Coconut Ice Cream:

- Very Fresh Islandy Flavor! If you have room for it, Try It!

After having Homemade Thai food and Several Thai restaurants, I think its safe to for me to consider this place the Mecca of Thai Food!  The drunken noodle halibut  revolutionized the way I view Thai Cuisine. My experience here was Insanely Satisfying I wanted to give my waiter a Hug!!!!!!",1,0,0

I came with a friend so we ordered three dishes to split between us, two entres and one appetizer.

To start with, we ordered the stuffed chicken wings. These were my least favorite out of what we ordered. They lacked seasoning in my opinion.

Next, we ordered the Sweet and Sour chicken and the beef Pad Thai. Both of these dishes were terrific. The Pad Thai came with thinner style noodles than I normall expect with Pad Thai, but still, very good!

I wasn't particularly crazy about the service, as we didn't have a clear cut server, they kept changing, so we weren't sure who to ask for what. Also, their prices are sort of high for Thai food, but maybe it's because I'm comparing it to LA?

Overall, not bad, I'd actually go again, but who knows, with so many incredible dining options in Vegas, it just may be a while before I do.

I believe it.

Hands down, best Thai food I've ever had.  One of our friends said that he thought it tasted better than what he had in Bangkok.

First we ordered the Crispy Rice with sausage.  This was probably my least favorite dish, but everyone else loved it.  It has very strong mint and lime favors, and it's different than anything I've ever eaten.  It was my least favorite, but it was still good.

Then he had the pad thai, northern red curry, and drunken noodle soft shell crab.  EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious.  The northern red curry looked more like a stew than a curry (I guess that's how they do it in northern Thailand?), but it was still very tasty!  The drunken noodle soft shell crab was AMAZING.

What I liked:  every bite I tasted!  We tried the sticky rice, the Pad Thai with tofu, the Khao Soi braised short ribs, the Issan Nua Dad Deaw beef jerky, and the Mussaman Curry with beef (pardon any misspellings, going by memory here).  The server assisted us with choosing some very delicious and unexpected wine pairings.  Very good and worth the wait.  We went on a Wednesday night around 7PM and while we were unable to make reservations earlier that day, we were seated in about a half hour (kind of risky considering the trouble one must go through to get there--but isn't that what Vegas lives by, afterall?).    

What I didn't like:  being asked to leave when we were only there for maybe ten minutes after finishing\/still picking at our food (the people who were next to us, also a party of three must have loitered around for a good 45 minutes, which is inconsistent, hence the annoyance)--yeah, you wait a half hour to eat, then you get to sit for a moment and digest your food afterward, right?  I dislike how one has to taxi everywhere in this town and frankly you'd better bring a few friends to chip-in on the $40 RT cab ride to and from your hotel, but the food is pretty amazing and hopefully your work is paying for it all anyway.  I was disappointed that we missed out on any hint of spice (a Scandinavian-bred\/fed toddler could have easily palated any number of the dishes we ordered, contrary to their warnings).

Let me start off my saying the this place is deceiving. The small entrance when you first walk in makes it appear extremely small but once you walk past the front it has a huge interior and is very open. 

We started off with some drinks. Your usually beers. Water. Iced Thai coffee is absolutely best I have had. Simply delicious. 

The wait staff was friendly and courteous and always on time with the drinks. And the food came out quickly. 

We ordered stuffed chicken wing, crispy duck panang, garlic prawns, khao soi, and the Tom kah kai soup.  My personal favorite was the soup but everything was absolutely amazing. The place is not known for nothing. It was packed and everyone had a look of delight on their face. 

Between the atmosphere. The friendly staff and the heavenly dishes Lotus of Siam gets 5 stars from me and will be added to the list of places to visit when in Vegas.

I had high expectations given their reputation, recent spotlight on Top Chef Masters, and lots of high Yelp reviews. I have to say, I've had way better. 


Pros: 

-The place is way bigger than it looks from the door.
-They let you wait at the bar (but you can't order food there).
-They have the largest wine list I've ever seen at any Asian restaurant.
-They have an entire page devoted to Riesling by the glass.
-Their Thai tea is good, and I don't even like Thai iced tea.
-Their infamous garlic shrimp dish is super flavorful, sweet, and salty.
-Crab fried rice was decent but not a revelation. Super greasy.
-Pad thai tasted good and was cooked al dente. Small portion but good ratio of noodles to proteins.
-Service was relatively friendly.

-Cons:

-High prices. Small portions. 
-Pretty decent flavors in most dishes except for the tom yum koong which was just all lime and chili with very faint lime leaf taste and no real garlic, sugar, nor lemongrass flavors. They also use white mushrooms instead of straw mushrooms like advertised. I was so bummed since white mushrooms instead of straw mushrooms in this soup is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to Thai food. Ugh. -They also say that all dishes come with white rice, but there was barely enough for 2ppl (we had a party of 4 and were forced to eat like rice was a scarcity). When I asked for just one small additional scoop, they charged for it. Wth?!


Beer wine sake only. Large parking lot. Plaza seems sketchy. The meal wasn't bad. It was just disappointing after all of the hype and also in comparison to places I've tried in SoCal & NY.",4,1,1

Despite the hundreds of celebrities that swear by this Thai restaurant, this place is warm and has a casual environment. 

Always go with the Hot Pot for the Tom Yum soup, there's no comparison. It's amazing. Try mild or mild medium. I love spicy but medium was way too spicy, even for me. The Duck Penang changed my world, and the Drunken Noodle with Sea Bass made me cry for more.

The only thing that Lotus of Siam could improve on, is the location - it is off the strip, and next to ""massage parlors"" and bars. It is situated quietly inside a large parking lot, so it does take awhile to find it if this is your first time. The first time I came in I thought I was lost, but nope. The second thing is the service. I have been here more than a dozen times, and I love the mango and sticky rice they serve - it's amazing, do try it if you can! However, it is reserved for ""certain"" guests. I have asked for this dessert every time I come here, but about 60% of the time they tell us they have ran out. Turns out they only serve it to certain guests. Last month when I went, I asked for this dessert - the waiter said immediately that it is ""out of season"" thus they dont have it anymore. However, our own waiter told us other wise, and brought it out for us. As we were leaving, we heard another guest asking for the same dessert and were told too that it was ""out of season.

Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai- No doubt the best pad thai I've ever had. Perfect amount of spice and so much flavor.

Pad See Ew- Once again, the best Pad See Ew I've ever had. So much flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The beef was perfect with it.

Tom Yum Kai- The broth was delicious, but my mouth was on fire! I must have taken a spoon full of spices at one time because I was dying. Still real good though.

Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodle- By far my favorite dish of the night. The duck was cooked perfectly and the added crispy on top from the fat just made it amazing. One of the best things I have eaten all year.

This is, without question, my absolute favorite restaurant in the world. If I'm ever on death row, this is my last meal. If I ever moved away from Vegas, Lotus is probably what i would miss the most. I have been eating there about twice a month for the five years I've been living in Vegas. On her third or fourth nomination, chef Saipin Chutima won the James Beard Award this year - but the secret has long been out about this amazing, otherworldly culinary experience 3\/4 of a mile and worlds away from the Strip.

Almost everything I have ever eaten here is absolutely fantastic, and for spice junkies like myself it's a legitimate challenge. They operate on a 1-10 scale, but there's actually a spice level 15. I don't recommend it. But if you like some serious heat to your food, a 10 will kick your ass. The 15 is just unnecessary.

As for the dishes, almost all that I've ever had are fantastic. Here are my recommendations from the gargantuan, 150+ item menu:

11. Garlic Pepper Chicken Wings. These are bursting with flavor from the fried garlic and the green onions that practically drip off the crispy wings. I'm not really much of a wing person but I can go to town on these.

13. Nua Dad Deaw. This Issan style beef jerky is, in flavor and texture, completely different than any jerky you've ever had.

14. Nam Kao Tod. The BEST DISH EVER, and I mean ever. I order this every single time I go. It's a sour sausage salad over crispy rice with a complex and vibrant flavor profile that includes the always distinct and recognizable tastes of green and red onions, peanuts, ginger, mint, cilantro, lime, basil and chili. Seriously, I've never seen this offered anywhere else and it's unlike any other food on earth. You've never seen so many flavors, colors and textures all in the same dish.

55. Nua Nam Tok. Charbroiled beef on a flavorful and tangy mix of lime, rice powder and green onion.

59. Koi Soy. This Issan style steak tartare is unbelievably good. The rice powder makes for an incredible texture contrast with the beef, and the lime and chili mix almost cooks the beef the way that the citric acid in a ceviche cooks the fish. This one gets really intense when you turn the spice level up on it.

66. Issan Sausage. Let me tell you a little story about their Issan sausage, cured for weeks in-house with a mixture of pork, wine, garlic and spices. They ran out of it for a period of a few weeks a few summers back, and they were the longest weeks of my life. I craved it like a crack baby. It's a dry, sour sausage that's paired with ginger, peanuts, fresh chilis and red onions. This is probably about my 2nd most common entree order. Be sure to get some rice to mix it with, and wrap it up in a cabbage leaf. That's how it's eaten when served off street carts in Thailand.

72. Mint and Green Chili. Heat of spice countered by cool mint. I daydream about this sometimes.

79. Pepper Garlic Sauce. Emphasis on the garlic. Lots of green onions on this one too, that combination seems to work well.

102. Pad Thai. I've never had a better version of this dish, which all too often tastes too much of tamarind. But this is a subtle blend of the dish's strong flavors. Never had better.

107. Kai Koowah. Like a more flavorful, less salty chow fun.

121. Spicy Fried Rice. I feel like a gringo because I order the spicy fried rice more than any other entree. But it is simply a flavorful delivery system for some of the most intensely flavorful but not overwhelming heat in the whole desert. (I always order this level 10 spicy. I don't F around.) The garlic, basil, and fresh chilis add a bolt of lightning to a savory bowl of fried rice. Again, the best of its kind.

H. Nam Prik Noom. This green chili dip is the perfect choice for when you just want something light.

Those are my go-tos on the Lotus menu, depending on my mood. There's a couple other things that need to be said about Lotus.

The wine list is mind-boggling and affordable. It's a special treat for lovers of German and Austrian Rieslings.

The lunch buffet should be skipped. If you get it, you're missing out on most of the things that make Lotus such a special dining destination. Although I would be lying if I said I had never had the lunch buffet and piled on plate after plate after plate of garlic chicken wings and the world's best pad thai. But I'm there twice a month or more, that's a luxury I have that most Lotus visitors don't.

If you only eat one meal in Vegas, make this it.",8,2,6

Lotus of Siam no longer has a lunch buffet but I decided to try it anyway. My wife and I ordered a papaya salad, tom yum shrimp and duck khao soi. 
Tom yum shrimp was decent, the sour and spice hit all the right notes but there was nothing to set it apart from other tom yum soups I have had.
The duck khao soi blew my mind. The soup of coconut curry tasted mellow with a perfect kick of sour and heat. The crispy duck exploded with flavor while providing textural contrast to the smooth soup and soft egg noodles. This dish cost $27 but it was totally worth it.
I would have given Lotus of Siam 5 stars if not for their papaya salad. The best papaya salad I have ever tasted came Chim! in Pasadena, CA. A proper papaya salad should complement sour and spice, smooth and crunchy, sweets and bitters. It should achieve perfect balance in its multiple opposing flavors. The papaya salad at Lotus of Siam goes overboard on the sour and bitter. Do not order their papaya salad!",0,0,0

So when I came across Lotus of Siam, I naturally thought it was a massage parlor with happy endings. After all, the lotus is the universal Asian code word for vajajay. I quote from an ancient Thai love poem - ""She laid back with her beauty spread before me like a lotus blossoming, ready to capture the dew"". Who woulda thought that Thai poets wrote in English back then!  But after reading the reviews I was aroused in a different way.( Now the term sexual appetite makes sense) and I had to go (or come, depending on your perspective).

So far of all the Thai places that I have been to, Lotus of Siam has had the best food of all.  I was pretty amazed at the wine selection available for a Thai restaurant.  Who thinks about varietals from Chateauneuf du Paupe in a Thai place?  But they have it here!  Service was unusually good for an Asian place.

Tom Yum Kai and Tom kha kai was the best I ever had anywhere.  Nice acidity and creaminess of coconut was spot on.  Braised short rib with panaang was ultra tender and wonderfully flavored.  A fantastic idea for that curry.  Fried sea bass on top drunken noodles was also very good.  very tender with a nice crisp saltiness.  I'm not sure if my taste buds were a bit off that day, but the food seemed a bit on the salty side, but not overwhelmingly so.  Spice levels tend to be on the higher end, so I would order a notch or two down from what you normally get at other Thai places.

Gourmet magazine (before its closure) touted this as the best Thai food in America -  a pretty bold claim, but I can't find reason to argue.

If you can't get your spice on here, there is always the Green Door just across, so you can get your kinky on (or so I've heard).

I end with a famous Thai adage - Beware of who you lay with because you may be struck with the fiery burn of Thai chili in your head that has no mouth.

best thing - tom kha kai and braised short rib with panang",2,7,2

To start off, location.  When locating this spot,  it's very difficult so here are simple directions. When heading east on Sahara away from the strip,  it's about a mile down on the right side in a large shopping center. When you enter, make a right and it's on your right side next to a pool hall. If not, then you'll be driving around the large Center for a minute confused on its location.  Also for Las Vegas locals who've heard of this business, it's in the same shopping center as The Green Door.

Also MAKE RESOS! We went in on a Wednesday night and it was packed!

Food dishes ordered:

Apps:
Chicken Satay 
Wontons  (these were ok. Had nice flavor but needed more meat)
Cup of non-spicy veggie soup (ok, needed more flavor)

Meals:
Chicken fried rice
Chow mein 
Pad Thai
Pad Woonsen 
Sticky rice

Or main meal was awesome. The fried rice tasted so clean. Not loaded with sodium. It was our first time visiting  (party of 4) and everything was delicious. The service was spot on and the restaurant was very clean. This isn't a fancy place for dressing up but casual and an outstanding menu.

The take-home message: the food is great and there's nothing to complain about, but there's room for improvement here and there in the dishes.

I went with a group, and we shared several dishes. The Pad Thai was very good--fresh, complex, and a good mixture of flavors, though I thought it could have had more depth of flavor--more contrast between sweet and salty, tart and spicy. Our Tom Kah Kai was fabulous--piping hot, spicy, rich and complex. The green papaya salad was fresh and tart, though not quite as flavorful as I would have liked. My Panang curry with chicken was delicious, but extremely spicy even when ordered medium. The service was very good, the beer was cold, and it wasn't too hard finding cabs to take us back to our hotel. Best of all: Lotus of Siam isn't on the Strip!

I'll definitely go back if fate ever forces me to return to Las Vegas.

A note about how I rate: It seems to me that people mean very different things by the stars they give in a review. Here's what I mean: 5 stars means that a place is exceptional in some way, special even among very good peers; 4 stars means that the place is very good in every relevant category but not outstanding or exceptional; 3 stars means adequate--a place I would go to again but not great; 2 stars means unacceptable--a place I would not go again because it is seriously deficient in some way; 1 star is horrible, that the place  was not only unacceptable in some way but that it was exceptionally, unforgivably bad. In every case my rating is comparing the place reviewed to similar places-- thus an outstanding diner gets a 5 even though on an absolute scale its food might not be as good as that at a gourmet restaurant.",0,0,0

Lotus is sort of an upscale Thai restaurant. Service is great, but they still have paper napkins and paper place mats.

We order Garlic Prawns, Nam Prik (mild), Northern Thai Larb, and Tom Yum.

Tom Yum...they should name this Tom Yummy soup.  You can really taste the lemongrass in this.  But soooo spicey.

We wanted to try the Northern Thai dishes because they are not as common...I think I know why...just not as good.   

Larb seems like it's stir fried. Seems almost Chinese. You can definitely taste the spices and herbs. But has none of the tang like its southern counterpart.  The menu does say no lime, but I was surprised at how much of missed the lime!

Nam Prik mild version is really what the menu describes...like spaghetti sauce with vegetables to dip.    It's that simple to describe...i was so excited to try this.  My fault for not going for the medium spicey version.

Garlic Prawns...this was the disappointment of the night.  I've had this dish before and it was amazing.  As we walked into the restaurant almost every other table had a plate of it.  Not sure how everyone else like it, but I thought it was very average.  It had too much batter and not enough flavoring. I don't know if it was because so many people ordered it and they just got sloppy, but definitely not as good as what I remembered it. For $28 a big disappointment.

Overall I will give it one more try...but since it's so expensive...one more try is all you get lotus.

We called at around 7pm on a Tuesday to make a reservation for the same night and was told that they do not take same day reservations and it fully booked for the night but if we were to do a walk-in the wait was 20 minutes. I am from New York, a 20 minute wait for ANY type of food is considered fast. When we arrived there was no one in the waiting area except my friends and I. We were told there would be a 10 minute wait by the lady at the register until a waitress walked by and told us to follow her. I am pretty confident I know what a fully booked restaurant looks like because when I looked around, it sure wasn't it. There were literally 5 tables out of say 30 that were occupied. Rule #1: Don't lie, it just makes you look really bad.

As for the food: We ordered Pad se-ew, drunken noodles with crispy duck, green curry with chicken, seafood chili and basil leaves, and two orders of sticky rice. The sticky rice was lukewarm, hard, and not the usual glutinous texture. The noodles for the pad se-ew were good but the dish was fairly bland. The flavor of the green curry with chicken was great but it left us wondering where the chicken was. The ""slices"" were almost as if they were minced. The seafood chili and basil leaves was, for the lack of a better word, awkward. The flavor of the dish did not penetrate the seafood. Besides the initial flavor upon biting, the rest of the seafood tasted as if it was boiled in plain water. The best tasting of our dishes was the drunken noodles with the crispy duck but even this had issues. There were approximately 4 pieces of duck and enough noodles to feed 1.5 people. Even though it was advertised as ""crispy"" the skin of the duck was soggy. 

Overall, with this being our last meal in Vegas, we were sorely disappointed. As great as our vacation was, we wanted to end it on a high note by going to a place that others have claimed to have a ""cult following.""

I can't believe I gave this place 4 stars last time purely on reputation. With my own reputation on the line, I have to take out 2 stars from before as I was truly unsatisfied from the meal.

Since we did the lunch buffet last time and afterwards we read it's best to actually order off the menu at Lotus of Siam, my buddies and I ended up doing just that at dinner this past weekend.  None of us were wowed with the dinner and would just give it 3 stars at most for the dinner. After thinking about it even more, this place to me don't even deserve 3 stars.

We ordered the following:

1) Thai Iced Tea: Something that really can't be F-ed up, and it's pretty good here.  Nothing to complain about.

2) Pineapple Shrimp Fried Rice: The fried rice had a strong curry taste, but lacked ingredients.  The portion was small, and had yes, the plate had 2 friggin shrimps and pineapples out of a can.  For $8, I expected more.

3) Pad Thai: As the menu said ""It could have been one of the most popular Thai dishes of all time."" Clearly a mistake since they probably meant to say ""It could be one of the most....."" Anyways, usually I like pad thai at any Thai restaurant and the one done here is eh...so-so.  My friend was looking for the bean sprouts, it's like WTF happened to it?? Again, the portion was pretty dang small for something that cost $8

4) Spicy Catfish: Very bland and not that spicy. The fish didn't taste that fresh and I was probably the biggest fan of the dish amongst us at the table. Definitely a bad choice on our part, but hey, could that be the case with all the stuff we got?

5) Chicken curry w\/o coconut milk: It wasn't something we got off the curry menu, as this dish was on one of ""Siam's favorites.""  Definitely, it was not a favorite of our's. The curry was watery, lacked in flavor and ingredients. Seriously, another epic fail in my eyes.

6) Mango with sweet coconut milk sticky rice: Probably the best item we got that night. At $7.95, it wasn't cheap, but hey, nothing was really ""cheap"" here other than the fact we got a lot of bad food. I'll give credit when it's due. The mango was fresh and I liked the toasted rice on the sweet coconut milk flavored rice. Too bad we had to get 2 orders of this item since again, very skimping on the portions for the price.

Seriously, over the course of the meal, I had this WTF look as I was eating. For what we paid and all the reviews of the place, I expected a lot more. Definitely more than what I had at the buffet a few months back. Maybe I'm used to LA's Thai Town or Siam I Am in Redondo's prices, but seriously, nothing was of any good value here. I know it's Vegas, but come on, it's located in this ghetto Asian strip mall. Pfft... Will I come back here again? Hell no. I could find better food eating at the Bellagio Buffet w\/o leaving the strip. This meal taught me one lesson. I will truly appreciate what I have in Thai Town and the various Thai restaurants I frequent in the South Bay.

birthday.  We were initially going to go to Komol but were swayed by
the concierge at the taxi stand after he told us that Lotus of Siam
was world famous.  I still am not sure of that distinction but there
were pictures of famous people including Mario Batali all around the
restaurant with a lady whom I assume is the owner.

We decided to start off our meals with both the Moo Dad Dea (Pork
Jerky Thai Style) and Golden Tofu.  The tofu was fried perfectly which
gave it a good texture on the outside that almost made it al dente.
It's sweet and sour sauce was nice as well giving the tofu a great
overall flavor.  The pork jerky was an interesting dish but also good.
  For some reason it reminded me of some fried pork belly that I had
enjoyed previously and it was quickly gone between the three meat
eaters at the table.  For my entree I asked the server what the most
popular dishes in the restaurant were.  He mentioned the crispy duck
and something else but since I already had been looking at the duck, I
ended up ordering that.  Whenever I was asked how spicy I wanted it on
scale of 1 to 10, I replied ""Thai Spicy"".  You see in Pittsburgh, Thai
spicy is somewhere around a 15 or 20 on that scale.  However the
waiter said that their Thai spicy was a 7 and I ended up asking him
for a 10 instead.  Since I love spicy food it was not necessarily a
mistake but I did have tears in my eyes during most of the meal.  I
also had two other dining companions that could not finish their meals
due to the spice level with one of those dishes only being a 5.  So I
would have to recommend that you are careful in the spice level that
you order here.  Anyways, my crispy duck ended up tasting good, at
least what I could taste of it beyond the heat.  It was not at all
greasy and had some crunch whenever I bit into it.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in
the future.  I really enjoyed their food and also noticed some other
interesting looking dishes on their menu that I would like to try
whenever my mouth wasn't on fire.",2,0,0

Pros - food is actually pretty good. we basically went to town on the whole menu.  
    the fried wontons to start are really good.
    theyre green curry has a nice lil kik to it def recommended

Cons - Hard to find. Located in a pretty sketch area
   they dont give you much food... so you have to order like 10 diff things.
   pineapple fried rice wasnt very good.  how can you mess up rice??? but

Flavorsome curry and salads with all the five taste sensations in balance.

One of the better Thai restaurants I've been to. I ordered the Nam Prik Ong because it was featured on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate, and my bf ordered the Pad Thai. Neither of our dishes were extremely spicy although we had ordered them 10\/10 spicy. I enjoyed my dish, it was very flavorful, but honestly, it just tasted like a meat sauce from a pasta dish. Next time, I'm going to order one of the many other great things they have on their menu. 

My bf's pad thai was delicious, and our chicken dumpling appetizer was good too, albeit not Thai food :) We also got a thai iced tea, which I normally find too sweet for my liking. This was definitely on the sweet side, but I still managed to finish the whole thing. 

I'm looking forward to coming back and maybe trying some of their other meat or curry dishes.",0,0,0

Most Thai restaurants in the U.S. are really set up for western taste buds. Meaning, they are not really the type or the taste of food you get in Thailand. At Lotus of Siam, yes, they have the Pad Thai and things like that for those who do not like the spiciness of traditional Thai food, but what they also have is a great selection of true traditional Thai dishes, meaning they are spicy. 

If you want to eat true Thai food, look on the menu under the Northern Thai section and the Chef's Choice. The food is great !

This restaurant also has a vast selection of wine. This is very unusual for a Thai restaurant. Personally, though I love a nice bottle of wine, I don't really think of wine in association with Thai food. But, they do have it, if you want it. Plus, they also have a good selection of beer, Thai Iced Coffee, and other drinks like that. 

This restaurant is located in a strip mall. Though there are several other international restaurants around it, the outside is not inviting. Don't let this scare you off. Once inside the restaurant is very nice. 

Finally, this is a very popular restaurant. People pack the place every day and night of the week. It is best to make a reservation or you may be waiting quite a while for a table.

the location is away from the strip on the east side of las vegas blvd on Sahara.  it is in a non-descript massive strip mall with a bar called Cue Club nearby it. U have to enter from the backside where the parking lot which will seem a bit shady but its not bad.

the grub was as fantastic as winning big in the casinos! we tried numerous plates and were like 
holycrap to everything we tried.  we noticed that the menu has like 100 or more items so we just asked the staff whatever they recommended

got sake daiginjo bomb!!!
orders we got were all excellent including
a cold shrimp appetizer that comes with some chilis, dipping sauce which tasted like coconut soup flavor somewhat (bommmmb!!), we had a fried lobster that is market price tax that ass expensive
but oh wow what a fantastic massive plate.
also had Thai beef jerky it came with a waay bom dipping sauce + a great duck breast cuts plate. wow so good. 

we also had some other orders I cant remmeber i was ultra faded beyond drunk.  I know we had a great time and everyone loved everything,

take ur ass here when u go to vegas probly best thai place i've ever eaten in USA including in LA where i live. (actually just came back from Thailand, u must go the food is incredible!!) will be back 100% for sure on future visits.

there are all the usual soup dishes including Tom Kha Kai but we had a crazy ass beef with stock soup that was sooooo banging. I miss all them plates already.

staff are nice and the customers there were all chill. 
there was a family next to us from Torrance, CA 
that were eating a plate that actually convinced me to go which was a garlic shrimp plate. looked so goooddddd but we did not have more room. 
also, from what i understand the drunken noodles dishes are supposed to be extra good which is more reason for us to return again!!

The restaurant itself is located in and aged strip mall off of The Strip on Sahara Ave. and the decor is dated and worn with walls lined by photos of noted past diners including Drew Barrymore, Mario Batali, etc.. I can't decide if this added to or detracted from the ambiance but it's nice to see this chef and cuisine gettings it's rightful due notoriety.

The food at Lotus of Siam is the star and I was by most accounts dazzled. The menu itself is dizzying large with so many different dishes that's it's overwhelming so if you're unsure of what to order then rely on your server to help navigate this menu as they will happily make recommendations that are on point. All dishes are prepared at your requested spice level from 1-10 so be specific. My wife choose a mild level #2 while I opted for a Spicy level #7. This also worked well when moving back and forth between dishes from mild to spicy and back again.

Our Food:

Appetizers:

Chicken Satay (Spice level #2) - Simple but beautifully balanced with a sweet peanut sauce and a cool crisp pickled cucumber salad.

Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice w\/ minced, sour sausage, peanuts, ginger, green onions, fresh chilies & lime juice & ) (Spice level # 7) - The crispy & crunchy texture is wonderful but this dish definitely takes a little getting used to. My first reaction was ""This is really dry"", but when combined with the sliced cucumber and fresh cabbage garnishes it was balanced and addictive.

Entrees: (served w\/ steamed white rice)

Charbroiled Prawns w\/ Spicy & Tamarind Sauce (Spice level # 2) - This was a simple, perfect shellfish presentation with butterflied prawns still in their shells, simply charbroiled and served with two contrasting sauces of spicy vs. sweet & sour.

Thum-Ka-Noon (Pounded Young Jackfruit Shredded)
(Spice level # 7) - This Northern Thai dish was hands down my favorite of the night by far. Shredded jackfruit, ground, sour pork & spicy tomato sauce & herbs. This was so focused and satisfying. Wow!

Koi Soy (Issan Beef Tartare) (Spice level # 7) - I wanted to love this dish but I really was disappointed. The cubed, raw beef was fresh and clearly of good quality with a nice texture provided by the rice powder but I was so overwhelmed with the flavor of lime juice that I couldn't even decipher the actual primary taste of Beef Tartare.

Dessert:

Fresh Mango w\/ Sticky Rice & Coconut Ice Cream - 
The mango & sticky rice themselves were awesome. I love the savoriness of this dessert combination however I was not so much a fan of the coconut ice cream as I found the texture icy and the flavor lacking any distinct natural coconut profile. I asked our server if it was made in-house and he stated they bring it in from California. It did provide some welcome temperature contrast to the cool, tart mango and the sweet, warm sticky rice but otherwise it was completely forgettable. 

It's worth drawing attention to the exemplary service here as it truly is by any measure fantastic. The front of the house staff were very welcoming, attentive and provided many good menu suggestions. Our water & drink glasses were never even half empty and plates arrived and were cleared at perfect intervals.

I'd love to return again and try many more dishes along with the hope of finding more magnificent Thai treasures. If your truly love Thai food then you must try Lotus of Siam atleast once if not ten times.

Must haves:  

Garlic prawns.  Over half the tables have prawns whenever I'm there.  Crispy,  flavorful, delicious.  Don't forget to eat the shell and tail.  It might sound a little odd, but you'll thank me.  One of my favorite dishes in the city.

Crispy duck on drunken noodle.  It's always on my table when I'm eating at lotus.  Great flavor in the duck and the noodles.

Nam prik ong.  Ming Tsai called it the best dish he's had in Vegas.  Considering the foodie nature of the city, those are big words.  A non spicy chili dip with ground pork and served  with vegetables.  not sure why it's so good...it just IS.  

ONE THING TO NOTE...they specialize in northern Thai cuisine.   Order off that section of the menu, along with the chef specialties.  Don't come here looking for mind blowing pad Thai, curry, or anything you're used to eating at a ""normal"" Thai place.  This is the holy grail of Thai restaurants...order what they do best.

Lotus of Siam is located in a strip mall away from all the action of the strip.  When you step in the door you are greeted by a narrow waiting area filled with newspaper write-ups over the years giving kudos to Lotus.  If you are a drinker your best bet is to wait for your table in the bar area as there will be a wait--weekends can run up to an hour or more.  The bar is beer and wine only.

There are tons of tables inside Lotus of Siam with bright hanging pendant light fixtures.  If you are looking for a dark atmosphere you won't find it here.  

Lotus of Siam has really great tasting Thai food plus an excellent selection of wine.  I had the drunken noodle crab.  It was good but a bit steep in cost at $19.  My friend had a beef dish that cost $18 that she felt was overpriced.  I feel like your best bet is to order from their basic Thai side of the expansive menu as those dishes are $10 or less and will be same portion size and just as tasty.

But I've decided to update and dock another star because their service has consistently gotten worse and worse over the years, and the reality is there are far more quality Thai options in the Vegas valley now than there were even just a few years ago - including (or is that especially) those opened by past Lotus employees. 

My most recent negative service interaction involved our waiter losing one of our leftovers that we'd asked to get boxed up (we had three leftover dishes, and the waiter only gave us two back in boxes). I was particularly annoyed because I had only ordered that dish intending to take most of it home - we'd barely touched it. A different waiter came by, apologized, and told us that they would cook up a completely new dish for us to take. Honestly, at that point I'd have preferred if they'd just knocked it off the bill, but I decided to accept their offer and wait for the new dish.

But when we got home, we found out that the ""completely new dish"" was barely a 1\/4 portion of the original. I don't even know if they cooked a new dish at all or what - maybe they even just gave us someone else's leftovers that they were going to throw away. In any case, it just left a really bad taste in our mouths. If you're going to try to make up for your service failure, you'd better do it right, or you're just making it even worse.

Ultimately it's becoming tough to justify the trip to Lotus, and honestly even 3* might be generous - the service has really gotten that bad. Sure, there was a time when Lotus was the standout Thai option in Las Vegas, but it's certainly not the case anymore and I get the feeling that Lotus manages to stay busy only because they're riding on their past fame.",0,0,0

If you haven't been there in over a year then note that they've expanded and have taken over what I think is part of the wig shop (yes, wig shop) next door.  Like a lot of good places in Vegas, it's in a strip mall and if you didn't know it was there you would never see it because it's not facing the road.  The strip mall itself is a bit old and run down, and the exterior of the place is not impressive.  The entryway of Lotus, even, is tiny and cramped.  Their ""waiting area"" has space for about 4 or 5 people and that's it.  Once you get inside, though, things look decent.

If you go at night or on a weekend expect a bit of a wait if you haven't called ahead for a reservation -- don't worry though, no fancy wear is necessary, a t-shirt and shorts would be fine.  Normally you can just walk right in and get seated immediately.

Every time I've been the staff has been helpful, courteous, and attentive.  They do a lunch buffet which I thought looked rather pedestrian the couple of times I've been there during lunch, but honestly you should actually sit down and order a real dish or two rather than pick from the buffet unless you happen to work near Lotus of Siam and go there frequently for lunch.

The menu is absolutely huge, with maybe up to 200 items on it, and they offer both northern and southern Thai dishes, not that I would necessarily notice the difference.  The prices are usually around $10 per dish, and they have a wide selection of wines since they've expanded if that's your thing.  

The chicken satay is a good classic appetizer that's done well and served with the usual peanut sauce and a small vegetable salad.  I've also had some garlic & pepper chicken wings which is probably the only thing I've had that I've not been overly impressed with.  They were a bit too dry to me.

As far as dishes go, I had the moo yang (grilled pork with a very nice savory dipping sauce) once and thought that was pretty good.  The next time I got the chicken panang curry and that has become my usual order.  The quality of the ingredients is top notch and the portions are large.  Every person I've ever taken here has been very impressed.  

As a side note, if you do drop by Lotus of Siam when they are packed and you don't have a reservation, just go to the adjacent restaurant, Namaste, which has some extremely good and similarly priced Indian food.",0,0,0

Flying in Friday night from Newark, I search Yelp and online and find good reviews of Lotus of Siam, calling it one of the best Thai restaurants in the US. I'm a huge fan of Thai (like Somtum Der, Pam Real Thai and others in NYC) and decided to try it.

That first dinner was so good that next night, searching for healthier restaurants not far from the Strip, I decided it was easier to just go to Lotus of Siam again.

Over 4 visits (3x for dinner and once for lunch), I tried:

ENTREES
- Northern Larb. Think minced pork with chilis that explodes with flavor, whether you choose a spiciness level closer to 1 or 10. This was the only dish I ordered twice in my 4 visits. Be warned though, if you're not much for hot\/spicy, choose a lower number.
- Nam Prik Ong (Red chili dip). While I saw this dish mentioned in reviews, I wasn't too impressed. It's tasty, just not as much so as the Northern Larb.
- Khao Soi. This was like a large bowl of flat egg noodles mixed with curry. Tasty but I preferred other dishes mixed with rice.
- Kang Hung Lay (beef stew). Paired with rice, this dish was good. Fairly flavorful.
- Isan sausages. This is Thai sausage sliced and served with a bunch of raw veggies (onions, Thai chili peppers, cabbage, etc). A good appetizer to share with friends (Though being hungry, I ordered this along with an entree for myself).
- Pad kraprow with pork belly and minced chicken. This is usually my go-to dish at Thai restaurants (generally preferring rice to noodles) but in this case I waited a few visits to try this. If you like minced meat with basil and chilis, you'll probably like this. 

DRINK
- A variety of different German Reislings. I haven't traditionally been into wine but admit I'm now sold on pairing them with Thai food.
- Also Thai iced tea once to see what it was like. Par for the course, not mind-blowingly different.

I liked this Thai restaurant so much I ate there 4 times over a 4-day visit. If you like delicious Thai food paired with wine and sake, it's hard to go wrong here.",0,0,1

And packed, so make a reservation. 

The food was really good. Not the best Thai food I've ever had. But most was great. The stuffed chicken wing is say skip. The papaya salad was really good. The larb, one of my favorite Thai dishes usually, was spicy. You can actually pick your spice on some dishes, we went with 7 of 10, which we was spicy enough. Any more and you're asking for pain. The curry was tasty but we were full by then. The crispy prawn dish was huge and awesome. Not cheap but not pricey either.

From the outside, you will say ""wow, really? This is what people are raving about?"" in a sarcastic tone.  When you get your food, you will say, ""wow, really! This what people are raving about!"" enthusiastically.

I am a very pedestrian eater when it comes to ethnic food. I don't like spicy, I don't like weird things.  So I was dreading my visit.  I was expecting to like 1 or 2 of the 10 things we ordered, in reality, there were only 2 of the 10 things I did NOT like (the spicy things)!

Since I do not have a baseline, I will just say everything was great, so from a picky ethnic eater, here was what stood out:

Mee Krob - interesting.  Just thought South Park made this word up.
Sea bass with Drunken Noodle - waiter recommendation over another sea bass pairing.
Crispy Duck with Panang - another waiter audible. Was spicy, but a great taste.
Pad Thai - again, interesting my unrefined palette
Mango Sweet Rice combined with Coconut Ice Cream - never had mango before, this was a treat! Definitely a great closer. Mango is only served in season. Wait for it.

Finally, the Thai Iced Tea was really cool.  Warning, do not let this water down in the ice, it will destroy the epic flavor.

Today however was not so great. 

I brought 3 co workers in for dinner after work and was so excited to have them experience the awesomeness that is Lotus of Siam. 

The bar tender had me try a drink that she said was similar to sparkling blueberry sake. It wasnt. It was like lemoncello. It was good so I offered to buy my co workers each a glass of it. The bar tender told me to buy the bottle and said its a good deal. It was $70.00. She didnt even tell me ahead of time. This wasnt a huge deal because I did like the taste a lot.

Then I ordered Nan Mao Tod and asked for it to not be Spivey. It came out with 4 Thai chili's in what equaled about 2 cups of rice. Crazy spicey. When I mentioned it to the waiter he didnt react at all other than to walk away.   This wasnt right as my mouth was on fire. I order this dish everytime by the way and its the main reason I come here. Couldn't even eat it.

I also order the rad Nah. It was good but very few noodles and mostly gravy. 

The pad see we was delicious though. Highly recommend it.

When a shuttle bus driver in St. George, Utah also recommended it our interest was piqued enough that I did some research.  Great reviews in all the food mags and a 2011 James Beard award had my interest piqued. Since I love Thai food (and Northern Thai food in particular) we had to check it out.

The restaurant is shockingly huge.  It is situated inside a half closed strip mall that has 4 Korean BBQ places, a Korean Grocery store, a saloon that was pretty hoping at 4:30 on a Sunday and the Green Door.  

We had tried to get advance reservations, but were too late (next next available online reservation was like 2 weeks in advance) and couldn't get through on the phone, so we decided we were going to have to deal with the line.  Lotus of Siam opens at 5:30 for dinner and we had heard that the line gets pretty long.  Since we were trying to grab a quick meal before catching our flight home we came early and wandered the strip mall for 20 minutes to see what else was there.  There was no line at 5:10 and we were just about to go to the saloon for a drink when suddenly two families queued up.  We decided to forgo the drink at the stand and stand in line, despite the heat.  10 minutes later the line was probably 40 people long.  We were, however, able to get right in and it took a little while for the restaurant to fill up.  Still, when we left there was a big line. In line we talked with folks about what they were ordering and they were all picking Americanized Thai food even though the reviews all said go with Northern Thai stuff.  

The Khao Soi was the best dish that we ordered, though it was a bit confused.  When I had it in Chiang Mai it always had dark chicken meat in it.  The waiter tried to get me to order it with beef, but that seemed weird so I said chicken.  I ended up with sliced (and dry) chicken thrown on top.  Looking at the pictures online it seems that Duck is how Lotus of Siam does it and that it would have been the best way to go.  Sai Oua was a good northern style sausage.  We ordered sticky rice with it and that was the second best.  Then we had Nam Prik Ong.  Also good, but flavored a bit similarly to our Sai Oua.  We could have skipped this and tried something else.  Finally we had the garlic prawns, which we could have done without all together. 

The restaurant is really efficient in terms of timing.  Everything seems very professional, but the whole thing is also really cold. No real personal interactions.  We ended up ordering 4 dishes.  The northern Thai food was good, but not better than what I get back home in DC.  The garlic prawns that everyone raved about, including our waiter, was ok but silly expensive.

Perhaps they were too busy and the quality wasn't as it normally is but overall not the best dining experience. Also, my other sister gave her toddler a piece of the beef and he promptly threw it up.

My main complaint would be how long the meal lasted.  This may be a Thai cuisine type of complaint, but the food came out so quickly that the meal only lasted about 45 minutes.  When dining out at a nicer place, I like to spend time to savor the meal and conversate.  Lotus of Siam cooks everything to perfection, but very quickly.  Beware if you're looking to spend the night out at Lotus, if so, it will be a very short night.

* Tom yum shrimp: I ordered this spicy.  It was very spicy, just the way I like it (hotter than eating a jalapeno straight).  The flavors popped and the straw mushrooms soaked up the broth.

I'm not really sure who's ranking system this is, but I would declare Lotus of Siam ""the best AUTHENTIC Thai Restaurant in America"" (based on my non-encompassing Thai restaurant experiences).  Unlike a lot of other hyped-up restaurants that I have visited, LoS does provide freshly-made, high-quality, and unique Thai foods that you will not be able to find @ 99% of the general Thai restaurants out there.  Apparently, Pad Thai,  Pad See-ew, and Thai Iced Tea are not the best representation of Thai cuisine :P  

So before you jump for joy about possibly eating the best Thai food you'll ever eat again, make sure you prepare yourself for a few.....surprises. First, LoS is located in probably one of the slummiest parts of Vegas; there isn't a strip club next door, but there are numerous sex and fetish shops across the street and just down the block. I don't recommend taking little Tommy and exploring the area before & after dinner....you may be opening the door to too many unnecessary questions.  Next, the wait time @ LoS during dinner hours on the weekend is going to be LONG.  For some reason, they don't allow reservations (guess they're so popular that they can demand such unreasonable policies).  Our table of 10 had to wait 1hr and 45 minutes, which we ended up killing at the pool table next door (**warning, it is a very divey, local pool point that's musty, dark, smokey, and seems as though everyone is selling crack or selling themselves***)

So once you get past the exterior facades and downsides, LoS will undoubtedly provide you a unique Thai dining experience that you shall not find elsewhere in Vegas and most areas.  Their menu is about 10 pages long, and these are all separated into rice dishes, noodle dishes, soups, chef's specialities, and then even a ""recommended"" dishes.   I was lucky enough to go with such a large group that we ordered over 10 dishes and got to sample a wide variety of dishes. 

I can assert that their rice dishes are very....normal and not-special, but their noodle dishes and specialty dishes were worth the price of admission.  Their  shrimp fried rice was actually below-average (or lacked MSG lol).   If you are a fan of fish, ask for their steamed fish that is fresh and super flavorful & tender.  Spiciness was not an issue for most dishes unless you request the ""Thai spicy"" vs ""American spicy""   Another memorable dish was the boneless beef ribs, which were great except you only get FOUR small little ribs.  So yes, we split that amongst 10 people through some surgical precision with our butter knife.   Finally, the other dish I remembered was their curry.  It was flavorful, not too rich or thick, and the added meat & veggies was definitely a good complement.  

Lastly, the service provided was excellent, the waiter was actually useful in suggesting good dishes, and he also seemed like a ""happy"" employee who was proud of working @ ""the best Thai restaurant in America."" He even boasted that they had recently filmed a Top Chef episode in Vegas the week before.  Next time, I shall go again and try some newer dishes and provide an update.  Til then, I better not find another Thai restaurant anointed as ""best Thai restaurant in the World\/Galaxy\/Universe"" or else i'll have to reevaluate my current review :P",1,0,1

I like to play the where-did-Anthony-Bourdain-go? game whenever I am travelling and so Lotus of Siam has been on my list for awhile, but surprisingly it's been probably over 6-7 years since my last Vegas trip.

The menu is extensive, so don't waste your time with the Pad Thai's and Pineapple fried rice and flip right to the Northern Thai section, because according to the master (aka Anthony Bourdain), their Northern Thai food is authentic. I was delighted with the Khao Soi, which is a soupy noodle dish. I got it with beef and the tangy flavor of the soup with a tiny spicy kick (I ordered medium but it was more like barely mild) and the sweetness of the coconut really was delicious. It came with some pickled veggies, which were also fantastic. I also ordered the Thum Ka Noon, which is shredded and ground pork with jack fruit. The initial bite was salty, but once you learn that it should be scooped with rice (and I recommend ordering sticky rice), then it was heavenly. The balance of the complex flavors in their dish made it hard to put down my chopsticks. I also loved the play on textures with the shredded pork, which was stringy and drier v. and ground pork, more saucy and softer.

Hopefully they open up again soon because I'd rather eat here than other places on the strip.",4,1,1

And the garlic prawns are not greasy and fried tasting then finally I had the crispy catfish pieces salad. I loved the dressing on his salad as it is lime and citrus and light as air.

We tried the fried prawns, fresh spring rolls (not on the menu, but definitely worth ordering!), fried chicken wings, shrimp pad thai, crispy duck with drunken noodles, and soft shell crab with drunken noodles, and everything was EXCEPTIONAL.

If you love rieslings and are in Vegas, you HAVE TO come here. I'm not even that into Thai and I go here. 

But, since one needs to eat in order to drink more, I recommend their sea bass. Pricey but seriously delicious. My dad got their equivalent of broccoli beef and it wasn't so wonderful. Just bland. Their dessert (the fried banana one) also left something to be desired (that something was ice cream since the thing was a dry as bone) but I just waved down the waiter and got some.

The chef is from Northern Thailand and special items from that area are indicated on the menu. Select some of those dishes. I prefer the Northern Larb for example over the standard larb.

Be adventurous and stay away from chicken satay, pad thai and penang beef. You can get that anywhere.

Now, the problems... all of the proteins (meat, chicken, etc.) are too over cooked.  Bad texture and chewy.  The other problem is their ""heat scale"".   I have ordered food to be medium, and it can be all over the scale from barely spicy, to so intense it is inedible.

The last experience we had last week delivered the flavors to perfection, but our proteins were way overcooked, and we had a salad that was inedible because it was extremely over-saturated with pepper heat, even though we ordered it medium.

I went to this place this past weekend.  After hearing all the hype about this place, and with so many great reviews me and my friends decided to give it a try. We got there at about 7:30 they told us it was about a 30 minute wait, which isn't bad for the weekend for dinner. So we waited, they called us  after 30 minutes, already knew what where gonna order. It took a while for someone to even take are order, So finally we got are order in about 15 minutes later. The first item that came out was the soup, the guy who was serving it only filled up half of the soup cups. I was wondering why is that? Its because there was barely any of the soup. I thought this would be just with the soup. So then we are waiting for the other food to come out this took a while, OTHER PEOPLE THAT CAME 15 MINUTES  AFTER US GOT THEIR FOOD BEFORE US UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! So 30 minutes later the food comes and the portions are SO SMALL, IT WAS LIKE I ORDERED A LUNCH SPECIAL FOR MYSELF. I thought I was the only one thinking this but all my friends agreed with me. Then we asked the waiter are these normal portion sizes, he says yes. PLEASE NOTE ON ALL OTHER TABLES EVERYONE'S DISHES where way bigger, People where even taking food to go.

We ordered two dishes, I just wished we were with a bigger party so that we could have tried more dishes.  I ordered the braised short ribs... love me tender, tender meat!!!  And the SO ordered the pork stew northern curry.  Both were lovely the Pork stew had a good bite, a bit spicier that I would like but I still enjoyed it.  It was a bit odd that the waiter didn't ask how hot we wanted it but to me that's sometimes a good sing of a great restaurant.  I like it we a chef prepares a dish how it should be enjoyed no matter who's taste bud is eating it.

We also ordered the sticky rice and mango... big mistake as this push us over the top and almost exploded as I made my way out of the restaurant.  I don't know if it was just the fact that I was too full but the desert did not really impress me too much.  Pretty standard sticky rice\/mango one can find in other good Thai place.
I would give this place 5 stars if not for the location.  Great food nice space inside very reasonable prices.

I ALSO TRIED
- Tom Kha Kai w Chicken (5\/10)
- Penang Curry w Beef (4\/10)

First off, I haven't written a review in a really long time! I love the fact that I travel a decent amount for work, so I get to try a lot of new places and write reviews. Ironically, it's because of that travel that I haven't been able to write any reviews lately. I've had so many jam-packed 1-day travels that, I might check in to a hotel on Yelp, but I'll knock out about 20 seconds after, then wake up, shower, and leave - all while still kinda sleeping. Even meals have been rushed. The business dinners might be in nice restaurants, but we're having such fierce conversations about work, that the food might as well have just teleported into our stomachs without ever being tasted.

OK, now that that's out of the way, a little history. Pad Thai used to be what I thought Thai food was. Yes, I know that it IS Thai food, but I mean I thought that was all Thai food was! In 2007, I had Lotus of Siam and we ordered all sort of things and it was amazing. Since then, I discovered more facets of Thai food, namely Tom Kha and Penang Curry. Ever since I tried those, I've been dying to try them at Lotus, because this is touted by some as the best Thai restaurant on the planet!

TOM KHA KAI
Server asked how spicy I wanted it, and then said ""on a scale of 1-10."" I was taken aback, because that's a really wide range! Even though I normally order ""Extra Spicy"" at other Thai places, the numbers intimidated me a bit, so I just said 8.

It tasted fine, but it didn't have anything in there that would make it taste great. No landmines, so that's good. The chicken was seasoned enough, but dry. The Tom Kha (and maybe this is just the style) was missing the tiny bit of sweetness that I've come to like and expect. As for spice, the first spoonful, I thought I got duped, but then after about 3 more spoons, the heat started to rise! Not enough for me to grab water, but enough where taking bites of the hot garlic prawns were painful on the tongue. It really seemed like that if you just had the soup, the 8 would actually be like a 6, but I think the higher the number, the more pepper bits are in the soup, so you just have a higher chance of picking one up, and those peppers themselves pack a punch!

PENANG CURRY
Sigh. It's missing that almost nutty flavor that I've come to like, and it was a little too ginger-y\/lemongrassy than I like. Consistency was about as much as condensed milk, and a spice level of 8, tasted more like a 4. The beef didn't really lend any helpful flavors, but hey, at least it was protein! Not the worst I've ever had, but I'm just really disappointed, considering how many people have this as their favorite Thai restaurant. Then again, it could just be different styles, which I admittedly don't know much about.

GARLIC PRAWNS
I remember when I was little, a friend of mine used to eat the shrimp tail. I was mesmerized! I had never even tried it before. So, I fearlessly started trying to eat the tail, and I was almost to the point of gagging. Fast forward 25 years and here I am at Lotus of Siam. 

The shrimp comes out looking like the letter w. The left ""u"" is the shrimp, the right ""u"" is the shell of the shrimp, both still connected at the tail. The whole thing has been seasoned and deep fried. Now, I've had Japanese sweet shrimp before, where they fry the heads, and it was better than eating that shrimp tail many years ago, but I couldn't eat more than 1. These were definitely better, but it took a lot of mental psyching and determination to eat several. 

The shrimp is good. The shell is actually pretty tasty. Out of all the fried shrimp shell I've had, this was the best. It was more crunchy\/crispy than any other one I've had by far. And it had a buttery flavor to it that helped take my mind off of the shell. For me, if I took a bite of shrimp and a bite of shell, that was a tumultuous bite, and I had to fight the urge to spit it out. The trick was to eat the shell by itself, like it was one big shrimp chip. The other thing was to keep my mouth dry. Once I took the bite, I had to keep saliva away (sorry to get so technical here) and definitely resist the urge to ""wash it down."" When the shell was dry and crispy, it shattered easier, which meant that it ground down finely so it was easy to swallow...like a chip. As soon as moisture was introduced, the shell no longer wanted to shatter, instead it would just flex, which meant that when you swallowed, it was that rough shell-like texture that made me want to gag. 

So all in all, happy I tried it, but perfectly fine with never trying it again.

LOTUS OF DISAPPOINTMENT
I can't tell you how disappointed I was with the curry and soup. I've been waiting at least 4 years to have an opportunity to come to Vegas to try these dishes, and it didn't deliver. It's not to say this place isn't good. I have had great meals here, but they're not good at my fav.dishs",3,2,1

But hey don't give up that's why we are here now! When I arrived, I asked for a party of 2, and the wait time is 30-40 min, it was barely 5:30! You can tell how busy it is so I will say if you have somehting planned later that night, make sure you have enough time as they do not take reservation. 

25 min later we got seated at a small table by the wall. The server came right away and asked for our drinks. They appeared to be nice and friendly. The place is a bit noisy because of how busy they are but that's how most Asian restaurants here, and I actually think it is more authentic that way.

After looking at the menu, we ordered Beef Skewer (No.6 on Appetizer) It was amazing! The sauce that came with it is creamy and yummy! For entrees, my boyfriend ordered pork pad thai which is amazing as well. But for my yellow pork curry, I am not too impressed. I think personally I am used to Indian curry which is thick and creamy , so when I tried Thai curry , it is too watery for me. The veggie inside is not too cooked in my opinon, and I ordered a 7 out of a 10 spicy scale  which is way too spicy than any other 7 at other Thai places.

After all, I still think of it as a good Thai food option, but I kind of think it is over rating on yelp, especially after a 30min wait. I still prefer Le Thai on Fremont Street better.

But don't let the extra space fool you because you will still need a reservation to escape the extremely long wait. 

1st place winner: Garlic Prawns: I'm not sure exactly what it's called, but this place is famous for it apparently. What they do is that they have these prawns dipped in a light, garlic tempura sauce and then deep fried. Okay, one: it's deep fried, and two it's garlic with prawns. What could possibly go wrong? It's SUPER delicious! Like the shells from the prawns cracks off the meat and becomes super crispy. I personally think the crispy skins are the best part of it because it just has this awesome crunch and then you have this huge explosion of flavor in your mouth... (I just realized how wrong that last part sounds... oh well!) 
2nd Place: the Shrimp Pad Thai: I was really surprised about the execution of the Pad thai. Unlike most Thai restaurants, they use a thinner and skinnier noodle which actually absorbs the peanut sauce a lot better because of the greater surface area AND it's chewey which deserves my love and affection.
3rd Place: all other food items. I can't really go into depth on what else you should order here because I'm already drooling enough as is after explaining the prawns.... hehe

After ALL the HYPE about this place, my husband found the food a little less than expected.  But the food was authentic, not your typical American Thai menu, yummy, and the service was very good.  We ordered short ribs with egg noodles in red coconut milk curry, a chicken curry dish (""unique curry"" in a rice powdered red curry base) that was kind of a soup, and the chopped meat dip with raw vegetables that has gotten much press from ming tsai.  Specifically, the names of the dishes: khao soi braised short rib, kang omm, and nam prik ong, My favorite was the Lotus Of Siam special, the kang omm, because the flavor of the broth was so savory, and the vegetables so wonderfully prepared.
The coconut curry dish with short rib, khao soi, was also good, but be ready for a sauce that is sweeter than it is spicy or savory.  
The meat dip thing, nam prik ong, was interesting and is reminicent of a bolognese to my palate, but it is much more subtle to someone with a more discerning palate like my husband.
MAKE RESERVATIONS! Most of the people who came waited on line for upwards of an hour or were turned away altogether.  But we were seated right away because we had reservations.

The decor is finally being elevated a little closer to the high quality of the food. Surprisingly, I didn't think my meal was as exceptional as my last visit in September 2009. It was still super yummy, but didn't have the same wow factor. Is it the remodel? Larger dining room?

I started with the thai style beef jerky. It was juicy and great in taste but a bit hard to rip 
apart both with the knife and teeth. I was kind of sore in my jaw after the appetizer like ive had a bunch of jaw breakers but it was so tasty i couldnt stop eating.......... 

I couldnt decide on what entrée to choose so i took chicken with cashewnuts and oystersauce and the beef panang. The waiter asked how spicy we wanted the food from a 1-10 rating..... 
Since we all love really spicy food like thai and indian and ive spent several weeks in thailand i took 7 on my dishes. BAD CHOICE.......it was so spicy i almsot fell of my chair and by far the most spicy food i have ever had. We sat in silent the four of us but in the end ate ALL of the food. 

That was how good it was. The flavours came through even though the spicyness and the beef and chicken was very fresh. We drank ALOT of water with the food but wouldnt hesitate eating here again. Would not go over 5 next time when it comes to the level of spicyness.

We ordered fried fish cake with sweet and sour peanut sauce for appetizer.
Very pungent flavor of fish sauce and cilantro mixed in fish cake, matched perfectly with sweet and sour sauce. Cucumber in the sauce was very refreshing and good combo with fish cake which was fried to crispy perfection outside, yet soft and slightly chewy inside.

I had studied yelp reviews since I found out we were going here, and I knew I had to order Crispy Duck Khao Soi!!
Hand cut egg noodle works very well with coconut curry because more surface, the more curry it holds on to.
Crispy Duck,,,what can I say? It's Crispy Duck. I'm a fan. #nuffsaid

Third dish we ordered was by our servers recommendation, one of their most ordered dish, Garlic Prawns.
It's not just fried shrimp. You can enjoy crispy fried shell, and very meaty shrimp, also fried crispy, in garlic, chili and some other flavor. I just appreciate chefs' skill and patience in peeling prawns so they are still intact as one piece after battering and frying and mixing with seasoning.

It was just me and my husband, so of course I got about 1\/3 of khao soi and 1\/2 of garlic shrimp to go. 

I cannot wait to go back there, with bigger party next time, so we can order bunch of different dishes and try them all!

We got the spicy catfish with basil, crispy duck in panang sauce, Tod Mun Pla (deep fried fish-cak), and Tom Yum Kun soup.  We got everything medium, oh also, everything came in exactly as medium for me, its not one of those places where medium means, low to zero spicy.

The Tod Mun Pla was great, I love the spicy sauce with cucumbers that came with it.
Tom Yum Kun soup was good, but was actually a little spicy for me.
The spicy fried catfish was real tasty and it stayed crispy till the end, I was expecting it to get soggy later on in the meal, but it stayed crispy.  
The crispy duck was also great, the only part of the duck that was crispy though was the skin.  It came with a panang sauce, which was good, we put that over our rice.  The duck was a little pricey though, about $21, was expecting it to be a whole duck, but was probably only half a duck.  But was still worth getting it.

Here's what we had:

Crispy duck with Penang curry- WOW. This was definitely my favorite. Normally with duck curry I see that the duck is swimming in curry, which leads to soggy skin. Not this dish! The curry was perfectly creamy and spicy, and they place the crispy duck on top so you have crispy skin with every bite. We shared this dish between 4 people, and I think I could have eaten the entire thing myself. I'd say splitting this dish between two people would leave someone hungry if you didn't have other dishes. 

Garlic Shrimp- Now I see why this dish has been mentioned over 200 times! The shell is taken off and fried along with the shrimp meat. So at first I was confused why my shrimp had no meat. The skin was crispy and unlike other places where you struggle to chew it, this version was easy to swallow. The garlic flavor doesn't shine through as much as I'd like, but I would still get this again.

Pad See Ew- Noodles were cooked well and the chicken wasn't dry. It was very good and I would order it again if I was in the mood. Next time I want to try the drunken noodles. I really liked the balance of flavors so I think the other noodle dishes will be good, too.

Service was very friendly. Even though it was busy we had our waters filled and were checked on multiple times. 

The portions are a little on the small side for the price but what you get is pretty amazing. I had a hard time deciding whether I would give this place 4 or 5 stars, and I can't fault them for doing things well and charging more for it.

There isn't a vegetarian section of the menu here, but from the sound of it when I spoke to the waiter, it isn't uncommon for folks to request vegetarian versions of things, so I guess you can always ask!

I got the Rad Na with tofu and mushrooms and specified that it needed to be vegetarian (in case of fish sauce, which is common) and mentioned my egg allergy and things came out okay. It was a lot saucier than I expected (it looked like soup when it came out, actually), but was tasty nonetheless. I also got a Thai iced coffee, and that was tasty (as it always seems to be, regardless of restaurant).

My non-vegetarian compatriots apparently thought the wonton soup was amazing (and ended up ordering two more rounds of the stuff, one more for the table and one solely for one person who liked it that much). Mr. Piano got the pad thai, and thought that was fine. The others I believe also ordered the sea bass and the crispy duck, and I think they preferred the duck. Not 100% sure on that. But they all felt it was quite good, so I'm inclined to believe them.

The décor and setting of the place is rather nice, and the service is pretty good. The menu is admittedly very large, so it's surprising that they can keep up with it and execute such a wide variety of dishes well. Also, that could be a problem for the terminally indecisive or the easily overwhelmed. Still, no vegetarian section, which would have been nice. The actual location of the place is a bit desolate (it seems like an abandoned strip mall, except for the Korean BBQ place which may or may not be on life support via the Korean tour bus we saw headed there), and we definitely arrived right when they were opening (with reservations, since there were 7 of us) and there was a line past two dead shop fronts before they started letting people in, so if you don't have a reservation, be aware that there's a lot of people going here for dinner. On a Monday, even.

That said, I didn't notice it being significantly better than other Thai food I've had, but since I could only try one dish and everyone else liked it so much, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. I'd certainly eat here again if in the area--it's a good value for the money, and tasty :)",1,0,0

1) Make the chefs happy and go for the back of the menu where the specialties are.  Don't even think about ordering Pad Thai!

2)  If you like Riesling, they have an overwhelming list.  But we always seem to get a bottle that has gone into secondary fermentation.  If you consider a bit of gas to be a fault (as I do), you'll likely have to return it for something else.  Or just give up and enjoy the bubbly!

3)  Watch the temp on the spice, it gets hot FAST.  Bring facial tissues and enjoy the heat.

4)  MAKE RESERVATIONS, ASAP!  While they seem to make every effort to accommodate those without, this place is ridiculously popular and will always be booked up.

5)  Don't judge a book by its cover.  When you pull up, it will look like a dump.  The area is old, run down and looks a bit scary, though it's largely abandoned.  Go inside and you will find a nice restaurant.

Stellar food. Best pad thai I ever had. I had the pork khao soi, and adored it. It had very delicate egg noodles that I have to assume were created that same day, in a savory curry-ish broth. Our kids, usually picky eaters, loved the fried rice and satay. The location is a nightmare: this restaurant is found in a super sketchy strip mall off the Strip. I was really glad we went for an early meal and were able to leave before the sun set. The service was pleasant and efficient: they keep things moving. It was quite busy. We showed up without a reservation on a Tuesday night around 6 p.m. and were told it would be a 30 minute wait: instead, I opted to make a reservation for the next day, and there were very few open time slots.

Garlic Prawns- large and tasty succulent prawns.  It was good but I feel like you can get this dish somewhere else and probably for half the price.  It's really just deep fried prawns with a lot of garlic and black pepper.

Crispy Duck in Panang Curry- my favorite dish of the two.  The curry is creamy, spicy, and was delicious with rice.  The crispy duck is good but only comes with about five pieces.  If they had just the panang curry without the ridiculous priced duck, I would get that instead.

While both dishes were tasty, it was a little too salty all around.

Tom Yum Kai - Fire! Getting a 4 on the spice level should be comfortable enough for everyone. A 4 translates to maybe a 5 or 6 for solid foods...A lemony, savory broth with heat. Chicken & Shrimp a plus too....

Roasted Duck Curry - Don't really fuck with duck but was a solid dish

Chicken Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles) - Ever since I had drunken noodles I don't really fuck with pad thai anymore...

Pineapple Fried Rice - Hint of curry for savoriness and pineapple for hint of sweetness bringing this umami flavor to the dish.

Garlic Prawns - Must get item everytime. Shell and meat are seperated with it both being deep fried. The shell is edible and similar to shrimp chips as far as taste....

Northern larb - very good, packs a kick

 Thai food, more specifically, delicious, authentic Thai food is almost impossible to find. Being a traveler, I've been seeking something that would be comparable to what I've tasted when I was in Thailand. For me and my friends, we had to travel to Las Vegas, Nevada in order to experience what I believe is to be the best Thai food outside of Thailand...and it's only an hour flight away from LAX. 

 Saipin Chutima is a James Beard Award recipient offering traditional, authentic Northern Thai recipes that were passed down from generation to generation. It is a step away from the sweet and tangy flavors that so many of us have been exposed to and are familiar with. 

A line congregates outside of the restaurant before opening its doors for service. The menu sits like a book, with numerous dishes to choose from. The décor is simple, casual and a little outdated (but who honestly cares when you're here for the food). Photos of famous people who have visited the restaurant line the walls. And the food...well, it's simply superb. 
 
MY FAVORITE DISH. EN TUAN (HOT POT: $13.95): Spicy and sour soup with beef tendon, bean sprouts and beef slices. I seriously dream about this soup day in and day out after I had my first taste. The broth was full of flavor....bold, luxurious with a lot of depth. Hints of garlic can be tasted in the soup that was seasoned well. The tendon was perfectly cooked with the best texture that ever was put forth in soup. I could slurp this forever and never get sick of it! Thank goodness we got a bowl. It was more than enough for a group of four and the fire in the middle definitely kept the soup hot. We asked for a spice level of 5 and could not taste any spiciness unfortunately (maybe we just have a high tolerance).  

 
LARB WITH PORK ($10.95): Ground pork, chopped onion, green chili, and lime juice served with fresh cabbage. The salad was fresh, with a nice balance of acidity and refreshing. Slightly spicy and nicely seasoned. I enjoyed it but the next time I'm there, I wanna try the Northern larb salad.  

DRUNKEN NOODLE SOFT SHELL CRAB ($22.95): Deep fried soft shell crab with homemade fresh chilis and Thai basil served on top of pan fried flat rice noodle. I loved this dish. The crab was extremely crispy and retained its crispiness throughout the remainder of the meal (although it wasn't long since we scarfed everything down pretty quickly). The noodles were nicely cooked and was a bit spicy. They didn't ask our spice level and I assumed they kept it at a 5, which was the perfect spice for a good kick.  

 
CRISPY DUCK WITH PANANG ($24.95): Crispy duck topped with Thai style red cream curry sauce with cognag. This was absolutely delicious. The duck was extremely crispy. The panang curry was rich and spicy. It was slightly sweet, yet savory and full of flavor. This was definitely one of my favorite dishes and a must order.  

THUM KA NOON- POUNDED AND SHREDDED YOUNG JACK FRUIT ($10.95): This local dish from the north is unique to the northern part of North Thailand. Made of shredded young jack fruit, ground pork, tomatoes, northern Thai spices and seasoning. This was seriously my second favorite dish. I loved everything about it. It was sweet, a little tangy and a bit sour and spicy. The texture was similar to shredded meat. As full as I was, I couldn't stop eating this dish.  

 
MANGO WITH SWEET STICKY RICE- SEASONAL ($8.95): Sweet, delicious, good. The mangoes were ripe and the rice was perfect. Enough said.  

Overall, you can't go wrong when ordering at Lotus of Siam. Chutima managed to bring dishes that you normally wouldn't find at your local Thai restaurant. It's a special place when literally everything you order tasted phenomenal. I had a difficult time deciding my favorite dish amongst the amazing dishes. When you dream about the food and can't get it out of your head, then you know you've found a gem. The next time I visit Lotus of Siam, I need to try the Nam Prik Noom (just sayin').

Taxi drivers know about this place, there are photos of celebrities all over their walls, and reservations are highly recommended.  When we arrived at 6pm on a Wednesday, the restaurant was empty... but it got packed after 7pm.  Here is what we ordered (on a scale of 1-10 on spice, we got 2, and it was plenty spicy):

1) Nam Prik Ong - featured on ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"".  Very interesting... it's like a chili dip accompanied by a bunch of things you can dip with.  I can't say I loved it, but it was definitely unique.  Wouldn't get it again but definitely worth trying out.
2) Pad Thai - very good but the noodles are skinnier than your traditional pad thai.
3) Drunken Noodles - SO Yummy!  
4) Papaya Salad - very good!
5) Fried Garlic Prawns - my favorite dish.  I loved how they took the shrimp OUT of its shell before they battered & fried it.  It was seasoned & cooked perfectly.
6) Chicken Satay - just like any other Thai restaurant
7) Yellow Curry with Chicken - the chicken was good cuts of breast meat & potato was cooked perfectly.  

Some people say that this is the best Thai restaurant in America.  I don't know if I'd go that far... but then again, I can't name a Thai restaurant that I think is better.  What I love about Lotus of Siam is that they offer all your traditional Thai dishes that you are used to ordering and then they have some really unique dishes that you can't find in other Thai restaurants.  Is it worth the hype?  YES.",0,0,0

We started with the papaya salad and the only thing to say is it was just an average salad.  The papaya could have been cut thinner to be more delicate.  Then the garlic prawns were pretty greasy and tasteless as well as the crispy duck with chili mint sauce, and not at all crispy.  

Do yourself a favor and don't be tempted to eat here. If this restaurant was in NY or LA, it would not last 3 months.   In addition, the location is further insulting because the food was so disappointing.",1,0,0

The other thing he said was, ""This place is located in the Tenderloin of Vegas. It's sketchy for sure."" 

So right on both counts. The food was so good. We had the fried prawns where the entire prawn is deep fried to a crisp and you eat it in its entirety. We also had the duck and the beef over rice noodles. It's not what I usually order at Thai restaurants, but I thought it was pretty darn yummmm. 

He was also right about it's surroundings. We were accosted by a couple of ""professional"" pan handlers, TWICE, in the parking lot. And he also pointed out some bar called ""The Green Door"" across the lot: a swingers club. So umm, yeah...it's a rather questionable area. 

But the environs doesn't seem to deter patrons from frequenting this place because it's busy busy. Make reservations if you're planning to come here. The service is friendly and the place is clean, though it lacks much character. 

So, if you want to venture beyond the Penang Beef and the Pad Thai dishes, ignore the panhandlers and head on in to get some awesome Thai food ;)",5,5,6

We were lucky enough to walk into the restaurant at 6:00pm on a Friday night as a group of three with no reservations and get seated immediately.

After perusing through over a 150 choices, I ultimately decided to start off with the Bangkok style tom kha kai and a Thai iced tea. I typically order this soup at every Thai restaurant that I attend, not only because it is a guilty pleasure of mine, but also because it serves as an excellent baseline comparison. With that being said, I was certainly disappointed with this dish. Obviously lime is a crucial element of tom kha kai, but this level of lime was excruciatingly overpowering, so much so that the lime was entirely the focus of the dish. The decision to use button mushrooms in the soup, instead of straw mushrooms also bothered me since button mushrooms are almost as substandard as shiitakes. 

Anyways, after finishing the tom kha kai I ignored the formation of any previous negative judgements, and ordered the chef's choice: the crispy duck with panang. The duck was placed atop the curry in a strategic effort to maintain the crispness of the skin, and it did just that. The duck was decadent, however, the panang was actually the highlight of the dish: spicy, creamy, well-balanced and delicious with both the rice and duck.

Ultimately, I highly recommend skipping the tom kha kai as I am sure that there are much better starters on the menu. As others have stated, please don't even bother to order the pad thai, there is seriously no excuse. Although I've notice some complaints from other Yelpers, the crispy duck with panang was worth the high price point. The dish fortunately provided a much needed redemption from the letdown of the tom kha kai. I'll certainly visit again to order more Northern dishes.",3,1,2

This place is simply amazing. Very authentic Thai food. I'm from LA, and LA is known to have a lot of amazing Thai places but none of them compare to Lotus. The restaurant is huge, and they have a bar that offers everything from wine to sake & beer. Over the years they've expanded the space to probably accommodate the amount of people they serve each day.

Here is what we ordered:

Crispy Prawns in Garlic
It's as amazing as it sounds. When they say crispy, they mean crispy! You can actually eat the shrimp skin. It's like chips. Try it, you won't regret.

Crispy Duck Panang
Here's the thing: I don't eat duck. I'm not sure why, but I just kinda feel weird about eating it. However, this dish is an exception. The duck is so crispy, and the sauce is so good and has the perfect kick. I wish all duck dishes could taste as good as this. Have it with white rice and you're a winner without hitting it big on the strip.

Pad see ew 
My 1st love. 
Best pad see ew that I have ever had. It's simple, not too oily, not too dry and a lot of flavor. The beef: tender! 

Another thing to note about this place is the service. Despite that the girl at the front desk isn't very personable or quick to greet guests, the waiters and the waitresses make up for it. They really want you to enjoy their food. Never was my glass empty.

The food took maybe 15 minutes to serve. I guess the crispy duck is their signature dish and it was my favorite. The salmon lover wasn't anything special and the homemade sauce was very salty.

For quite some time now, I've been hearing and reading about how great the food at Lotus of Siam is. How it's one of the best Thai restaurants in the country. And, well... I tend to agree. 

Everything I have had at LoS has been amazing. The food here is delicious, and, as far as I know, pretty authentic. They're pretty heavy handed with the fresh chilies, that slight sweet tamarind flavor that I enjoy in Thai food is prevalent and not too sweet\/overpowering like with many lesser places. That fresh, sourness from the citrus in their soups. I'm not sure I've actually had better Thai cuisine, anywhere. 

The dining room is... Bland and feels barren to me, with how large and white the space is, and how few adornments I can remember seeing, after you get through the waiting area (which is decorated with all sorts of awards and stuff, telling you how good the restaurant is, as if you, an avid yelper wouldn't already know). Perhaps my memory fails me here, though. They do have a beautiful wine room behind glass as, what I guess, I would consider the centerpiece of the dining area.

The service is straight forward. Very friendly. Not a finer level of service, but I don't expect white glove service with Thai cuisine.

The lines form early for this place so make sure your aware of the hours that they are open.

Although, I don't quite have a favorite dish there is a particular dish that everyone should order if it's your first time visiting Lotus of Siam, and that dish is the prawns!  They are so delightful and the best part about the prawns is that they are so deliciously deep fried you can eat the head and shells!  Sounds weird but trust me on this one, its definitely a good appetizer for a party of 2-4 people.  

The service here is absolutely great, on one particular visit a friend from out of town was returning home that same day.  We had about 10 minutes to go before Lotus would close at their lunch closing at 2:30pm, so we placed a phone order and pretty much told them to prepare a lunch for 3 and they could choose all the entrees, just to make sure they included the prawns of course!

To the food. Menu was quite extensive and Authentic than most typical Americanized Thai restaurants. We ordered a pot of tom yum soup. The server should wait until the soup is fairly hot enough before serving our first bowl. It was barely lukewarm and tasted too fishy. Then we had a larb salad.

We had the coconut chicken soup which was luke warm when served. My seafood salad dish was acceptable but since it was close to $20, I expected bigger portions. We also had a sausage dish that was very highly rated in the guide books but I found it dry and ordinary (it tasted like something I could have just picked up at a Chinese food store and microwave).

The shrimp was very tender and served with peppers and onions. Overall the dish had great flavor! They have a huge menu with a large variety of Thai food to order from. They even have a Northern dish section which has very distinct flavors. My mom ordered the Khao Soi which is a curry dish with egg noodles and veggies. It was so full of flavor and one of the best Thai dishes I've ever tasted. The curry was so good that she ate it like a soup and finished the whole thing. It had just the right amount of spice so I would highly recommend it! The explosion of flavors and distinct\/unique tastes really sets this Thai food apart from ordinary Thai food places. Not only that but the meat and fish were very good quality and that also really made this a much more exceptional and unordinary Thai restaurant. The meat and fish were just so tinder and fresh. The prices were also very reasonable, especially for the quality and quantity and being that they are in Vegas, they are one of the much cheaper restaurants.  Came here for lunch at about 2:15 (15 minutes before closing time). The waitress warned us that we may not get in because they stop giving out tables at 2:30 so obviously they would rather be done working by 3 than keep serving people. This is probably because they have so many customers that they it won't make a difference if they have one or two extra customers. However it was very apparent that they were ready to leave because the wait staff seemed pretty rushed to have us order and not exceptionally friendly towards us.

My wife is from Thailand, and I lived there for 4 years, so you could say we know Thai food.  

Lotus of Siam is very authentic.  The dishes which are traditionally not done well by American Thai restaurants are all excellent here.  In addition, it's the first place we've found in our travels around America that serves many of the excellent Northern Thai recipes not found elsewhere. (Try the Gaeng Hung Lay, a northern Thai stew of spiced long-simmered pork - it's outstanding!)

If you are just looking for Phad Thai or Satay you can find those anywhere - very few Thai people eat that stuff in Thailand, it's considered street food.  The focus here is on well-prepared specialty dishes and they don't disappoint.   We travel to Las Vegas once a year, and always wind up eating here 2-3 times during our stay.

The restaurant walls were covered with framed pictures of the chef\/owner and celebrities.  I was excited but when the food arrived i was quite disappointed because it was way too salty for my taste even after i asked the waiter to tell the cook to use less salt (from my experience with most Thai places that i have been to) :-(((

CHARBROILED PRAWN with spicy sauce and tamarind sauce  --- While the prawn were perfectly grilled the green sauce were toooooo salty!

SOM THUM (Thai papaya salad)

NUA NAM TOK (Sliced charbroiled beef mixed with green onion, chili, lime juice & rice powder)  ---- This dish was too wet and the rice powder flavor and texture was buried.

THUM-KA-NOON (shredded young jack fruit, ground pork, tomato, Northern Thai spices and seasoned )  --- the jack fruit and pork was too finely shredded\/choped and the dish became mushy. 

TOM YUM SEA BASS (Hot and sour soup with Sea Bass, lime juice, lemon grass and straw mushroom) --- for $23.95 this dish is waaaay overpriced because there was only a tiny amount of fish in small pieces :-( ... we chose 3 out 10 scale for chili hot and it was not hot enough for us, 6 was probably what we should have chosen.

PAD THAI --- nothing special, i've had much better.

MINT AND GREEN CHILI chicken stir-fried --- this was probably the best dish in term of doneness and saltiness 

KANA MOO KROB-Stir-fried Chinese broccoli and crispy side pork slice with oyster flavored sauce

I''ve heard so many rave reviews about this place and this trip to vegas, i just couldn't pass it up.  I made reservations a week in advance, just to secure my table for 5!  Everything was really delicious and If i must say, a lot better than i've had in Thailand.  Their green curry is AMAZING and the best i've ever had.  Everyone at the table loved it so much we decided to order a second order!  The papaya salad with raw crab was also one of the best I've had.  My favorite is still on the street in Bangkok, but this one was almost just as amazing!  That salad packs a lot of flavor which i love because I usually have to wait overnight for all the flavors to be absorbed by the papaya, but not at lotus of siam!  That alone gets 5 stars and so does the green curry.

We also ordered nam prik noom which is a northern green chili dip that is really good with fried pork skin and plain sticky rice.  This was probably my least favorite dish, as the flavor of the green chili wasn't like the kind i've had in thailand.  it's still pretty good though!

The thai boat noodles was good, but the broth could of had more beef flavor.  If you like this dish, you should definitely hit up Yum Saap (or Saap as its called on Yelp) in West Hollywood.  Its the closest boat noodle to the kind in thailand!

The Nam kao Tod, was something I have never tried and I thought it was pretty interesting and yummy.  Some people at the table didn't like it because the sausage is sour, but its supposed to be.  If you aren't a fan of sour sausage, then maybe stay away from this dish.

The Put Prik King is also one of the best I've had.  We got ours with pork and the flavor of the prik is soooooo good!  Other thai resturants either make this dish too sweet or too salty or not much flavor.  Each bite of lOS's Put prik king is packed with flavor and is so delicious with hot fluffy jasmine rice! =)

The restaurant has a small entry way where you check in and I was dreading being cramped in such a tight space for TWO hours. Luckily, they do have a large banquet style waiting room behind the bar area. Phew. We were quoted two hours but we waited closer to 3 hours. I was doing my best to control the hangry monster within. 

TWO MUST HAVES: Crispy Duck Khao Soi ($26.95) and Garlic Prawns ($27.95). Oh my lordy. The recommendations were on point. I favored the garlic prawns slightly more. Fried to perfection. You could eat the entire prawn -- even the tail! I came close to tossing them, but so glad my friend caught me before I did. Close call. Trust me, you'll want to savor every bite. And the duck... It's packed with flavor. My boyfriend's favorite dish. You must get them both. 

RECOMMENDATIONS...

Nam Kao Tod ($8.95): This was a crispy rice dish appetizer. It sounds plain, but don't be fooled. Every bite you'll get the taste of lime, chili, cilantro, seasoning, and the texture of rice that's crispy yet chewy. How they do it I do not know. Fry masters are working in the kitchen.

Thai Spaghetti ($11.95): It's the sauce and noodles that will win you over. It had that slightly sweet flavor, similar to pad thai. The noodles were served al dente, which was perfect. It had that chew texture that I absolutely love for noodles. 

Banana Roll ($8.50): Highly recommended with coconut ice cream (additional $4). I'm not the biggest coconut fan, but loved their ice cream. I need to know where they get it! The banana roll portion was generous even for a party of 6 like ours. Banana lovers will not be disappointed. 

We got a few other dishes, including their Thai Fried Rice with Chicken ($10.95), Tom Kah Kai Hot Pot Soup ($14.95), and Stuffed Chicken Wings ($11.95). They were all good, but the dishes I mentioned above were noteworthy! 

Stopping at Lotus of Siam will truly be a treat for your tastebuds. Food is AMAZING. It has officially made it to my #1 spot for Thai food. Service was fast and efficient from the moment you're sat. Prices are steep, but they really know how to cook up amazing food. Best way to go about it is family style so you can sample a little of everything.

They have many plates that would appeal to all types, from the adventurous eater to the safe nibbler. Most dishes are definite winners, but word to wise, don't underestimate the spice level. Our table definitely got a swift kick to the mouth with the papaya salad. But our other starters were pretty delicious in my opinion. The deep fried shrimp is what they are known for. The shrimp is succulent and juicy, but I wasn't really a fan of the pieces that were just deep fried pieces of shrimp shell. We also tried the crispy rice. 75% of our table weren't fans, but I thought it was definitely bold on flavor. It was different and I have to admit, I actually enjoyed it and was happy to have not ordered run of the mill chicken wings.

For our entrees, we tried a variety of Thai fusion and authentic Thai. The garlic pepper scallops were very delicious. The scallops had a nice crust, but were also buttery and smooth. But my piece had a little grit to it, so I'm hoping it was pepper and not sand. The sauce was also an excellent topper for rice. Next up was the mint leaf duck which I found  equally tasty. Again, it was bold on the flavor and was not a winner at the table....but I liked it. The duck was a little gamey, but was balanced nicely by the refreshing mint and sweet peppers. Lastly, we tried the massaman curry which can be compared to a red curry with a kick to it - one that kind of reminded me of the flavor of Tom Yum soup.  

They have a great collection of wine to pair with their meal as well.

All in all an interesting experience.",0,0,0

I went to Vegas during MLK Day weekend with my boyfriend and two friends.  Had fun, ate a lot, gambled a lot, drank a lot.  What a great way to end our weekend here at Lotus of Siam.

We went for lunch around 12pm on MLK Day on our way back to Orange County.  We were a bit fearful (or at least I was) of our luggage being in the car as we ate since the plaza looks really ghetto.  We got there a bit too late being as there was a group of extremely eager eaters who got there about half a second before us and took the last open table.  The wait wasn't as bad as I expected from other reviews here.  We waited for only about 10 or 15 minutes for a table.  But, being as hungry as we all were, that wait seemed like an eternity.

We ordered pad thai, papaya salad, a red curry dish, fried tofu, and beef salad (I think it was the #58 or something).  Pad thai was amazing!  One of the best I've ever had.  The papaya salad was good too, but I've had better at some other Thai restaurants.  The red curry dish was good, but it is spicier than you will expect it to be.  My favorite of them all was the FRIED TOFU!  it's just deep fried tofu with I think what was a sweet and sour sauce with peanuts.  It doesn't sound very fancy, but the sauce just makes the dish complete.  The tofu is of the right crispness and it just melts in your mouth.  The beef salad was only mediocre in comparison to the other dishes.

I only want to deduct half a star because first, there were no mangoes for the sticky rice w\/mango dish, which I was half expecting.  Second, when I asked for fried banana with the dish instead of the mango, they didn't have the sticky rice!!! But do not fear.  I left still happy and satisfied.

During our surprisingly short wait, we met a great man named Terry who washed our windows. Our waiter Joe recommended several delicious dishes to try. The menu has tons of options and you will not believe the wine cellar. I felt like I walked out of a Burmese jungle and into the Napa Valley by simply walking from my table to the restroom.

I'm not saying this is the best food in Las Vegas; I'm saying this is the best food in the world. We had coconut ice cream and sticky rice with mangos for dessert.

Everything was what I read about and expected.  The dingy, sketchy, vacant strip mall.  The low key restaurant facade and interior. The extensive menu and wine list.  And then there was the food.  I have been eating Thai food for years, with lots of authentic, top notch Thai restaurants in my neighborhood. Lotus blew them away.

The tod mun plar (deep fried fish cake) was cooked perfectly and was a great way to start our meal.  I then had the kang renu nakorn with chicken, which is a red curry but without coconut milk and lots of vegetables.  Spicy and tons of flavor, I think the best part was how it completely cured my hangover.  My husband had the drunken noodles with soft shell crab, which was a phenomenal dish.  

I liked that this place was mostly locals; while were there it was mostly hospital and office workers on their lunch break.

The lunch buffet looked excellent and is probably worth trying as well.

GOOD they emphasized. (Note: See my previous post about the Bellagio Buffet) Oh, and they wanted someplace off the strip thats not a chain restaurant. Oh boy. Fun!

I log onto Yelp to check out some options. Immediately I see my HUGE A$$ Pancake picture and suggest Hash House A Go Go. Its pretty tasty there. I was then told that someone in the group didnt want to see humongous portions anymore. Huh? What? Really? I dont think I've ever heard that before.

So I go on searching for the perfect place and there it was... Staring blatantly at me right smack dab on the front page. No other than the Review of the Day! The place? Lotus of Siam! Voted the Best Thai food in America by Gourmet Magazine has to mean something... right?

I jump on my cell and immediately call the restaurant. I know they are always packed and require a day in advance reservations. The nice gentleman on the phone tells me that they are allowing walk ins tonight and its a first come first served basis. I figure for a Wednesday night, it cant be that busy.... Can it? 

My friends leave from the Venetian and I leave from my house. I get a call about 10 minutes later.

""Leo, are you sure its Lotus of Siam?""
""Yes, why?""
""Its not in the nicest of areas. Its in a strip mall and its surrounded by ""massage parlors"" and such. Is it really that good?""

Feeling like they were in an episode of Punk'd, I assured them that the food is outstanding. I also jokingly told them not to leave any valuables in the car and to keep a close eye on their purse\/pockets. Of course you know there's always a little truth in every joke.

So I pull up around 7:30 and notice a few parties waiting outside the door. I see my friends and they said we're 4th on the list. Not to bad I guess. We wait a good 30 minutes and finally get seated. A couple that had been waiting there before us snickered at us since we got seated before them. I guess I would feel the same way too after smelling all that yummy food.

Lets get to the important stuff. THE FOOD!

GARLIC CHICKEN WINGS. Oh my God. This is delicious. Light crispy skin with honey garlic spicy sauce. Wow. This dish was good. You get about 7-8 wings per order.

NAM KAO TOD - The crispy rice and sour sausage dish was very very tasty. Lots of flavors attacking the pallet at the same time. We got a medium spicy and we felt it. The spiciness was gradually getting hotter and hotter with each bite. If you only took one bite, you'd be fine. But seriously, how can you stop after only one bite?

TOM YUM KUNG - Hot and sour with shrimp, lime juice, lemon grass, and straw mushroom. Tasty but I dont think I would order this again with so many other soup choices on the menu.

GARLIC PRAWN - Amazing. The skin was soooo crispy, you could eat the prawn whole with skin and everything. One friend kept on eating just the skin! The prawns were huge. Normally, the medium size shrimp go about 40\/45 pieces per pound. I bet these would be like 20 pieces a pound.

CRISPY DUCK with PANANG - I think this was the best dish of the night. Wow. The duck skin was definitely crispy. There were good chunks of meat under the skin as well. Definitely more than I expected. And that alone is mouth watering, but then add the Panang (Curry) and it was perfect. I would definitely without a doubt order this again.

SEA BASS OVER DRUNKEN NOODLES - The sea bass filets were seared just right and the thick (chow fun) noodles underneath were scrumptious as well. I was delightfully surprised about the large serving size.

All this food with some Thai Iced Teas and we were happy campers. Needless to say, I redeemed myself with a good pick and the party definitely had a good meal. This morning when I arrived at work, I found myself telling all my coworkers about Lotus of Siam and how AWESOME the food is. I guess I really liked it. Anyone coming to Vegas has to check this place out. And most importantly... DONT FORGET TO INVITE ME!

Tom Yum with Prawns (med spice) - the spice level was perfect, continued to build after each bite (or slurp).

Tod Muh Plar - fish cakes with cucumber salad, I would actually order the cucmber salad alone (its fabulous).

Kang Omon - catfish in a curry sauce, not as liquidy as a normal curry but delicious

Northern Thai - Khao Soi - noodles and beef (great - I had never tried N Thai food before)

People at my work love this place, and different people have different days they like to go.  Consequently, I think I've been here at least once for each day of the week.  But, as a caveat, I've only done the buffet, although I may be a rebel next time and order off the menu.

Anyways, my experience has been that the food is generally always good; sometimes, it's better on certain days than others.  Like not a specific day of the week, but for example, sometimes it's better on one particular Wednesday than a previous visit on a Wednesday.  

One person at work eats religiously at Lotus on Tuesdays for the soup.  I personally think the soup is best on Fridays, not the egg drop soup but the other soup (the name of which I can't remember now).  It's mildly spicy, which I appreciate because I don't love super spicy food, and it also has the right amount of saltiness...really, it hits the spot as the chilly weather descends on Vegas.

There's also really good mint chicken, and the main chicken dish on Wednesdays is delicious!  However, my favorite part of the buffet is the fried banana rolls, which are always present at the buffet party.  Oh-M-Gee, I would marry those things, you know, if I wasn't already married, if it were possible to marry fried rolls, etc., etc.

This dish is a true delight...always very high quality fish, usually prepared to preserve the delicate texture of the fresh fish and usually well seasoned.The bass is served on a bed of steamed veggies.  The Tom Yum Kai hot and sour soup with chicken, lime juice, lemon grass and straw mushrooms is spectacular and consistent in quality.

Several years ago Lotus did a large expansion,  started catering to tour buses, and in my opinion, at the expense of small groups and locals.  That change has resulted in service screw ups, including forgetting parts of an order several times, being served the wrong entree,  unusually long waits for the arrival of food and at times wait staff that was non-communicative at their best and outright rude at their worst.

Combine the above with the inability to make reservations online or by phone prior to their opening time each day, the inability to get anything but a busy signal once they open, and the mass feeding frenzy created by bus arrivals that has lowered the ambience from mediocre (hey, for years it's been about the food in spite of the mediocre ambience) to an ambience somewhere between an Army mess hall and a bus station waiting room, I've given up on going to Lotus.  When they're good they're really really good and when they are bad they are terrible.  In the past two years they have typically been close to or at terrible.

One way to enjoy the typically outstanding food is to order carryout.

The Panang curry was excellent. Great mix of heat, salty (fish sauce) and sweet(sugar added usually). The crunchy duck was a greaat contrast to the Panang curry and I really enjoyed it.

It's located on the north end of the Strip, and about a mile east. This makes for an easy cab ride. We made it there just before the lunch hours ended. That actually worked out well because it meant we had no wait time whatsoever. We decided to order several menu items and share, although it takes 10-15 minutes just to flip through the extensive menu. Everything sounded amazing, but we settled on the Issan Sausage, Kraphao Moo Krob, and Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab.

The Issan Sausage is their housemade grilled sour pork sausage (complete with a secret blend of ingredients), served with fresh chili, ginger, and peanuts. Delicious doesn't even begin to describe this dish. There were hints of sweetness and acidity throughout, and each bite was packed with flavor.

I also loved the Kraphao Moo Krob, which is stir-fried crispy pork belly with Thai basils, bell peppers, and minced dry and fresh chilis. The pork belly was spectacular, and the thai basil added a great dimension to the dish. I only wish there had been more of it.

The Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab is a deep-fried soft shell crab with homemade fresh chilis and Thai basil, served atop pan-fried flat rice noodles. We ordered the medium heat level, and that was just hot enough. It was very tasty, and I enjoyed the crispy crab coupled with the juicy noodles.

I had 5 different food items, and the only thing that was just ok was the Chicken Sa-tay. The Chicken Sa-tay wasn't bad, the peanut sauce included was great, it was just the fact that it was so ordinary in comparison to everything else.

We started with the Nam Kao Tod which was crispy and nicely salted and spiced. The Chicken Sa-tay was next and it was good, but again, it was something I could get at any Thai restaurant and I would have rather used the stomach space to try something else, but if you're a big fan by all means order it because it is  good. We also had the Tom Kha Kai which was a nice coconut milk based soup. It was perfectly tangy and spicey (but not too spice if ordered mild) this was one of the best dishes of this kind that I have had. Not the fourth dish was Roasted Duck Curry
which was very good, nice and ducky if you happen to like duck. The curry itself was also very well flavored, but I would have liked a bit more meat in the dish. The last dish was the Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass and it was to die for. The sea bass must have been cooked by a witch or sorcery because it was incredibly moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. In terms of cookery that sea bass was perfection. The noodles and sea bass complimented each other well, and this dish was the star of the evening.

We finished off our meal with an order of the Mango Sticky Rice topped off with a scoop of coconut ice cream. I am a big fan of sticky rice and this may be once of the best renditions of it that I've had. Nothing here was disappointing and the very reasonable pricing make this one of the best food experiences I've had, and my descriptions do not do the food justice.

He asked us out of 10, what our spice level would be. We said 7, learning our lessons from previous Thai restaurants. What we got was a 1. Zero spice. I was very sad.

What we ordered:

Crispy duck on drunken noodle ~$27: You get about a quarter of perfectly fried duck atop some drunken noodles, though the flavor signaled to me that the noodles were just a bit buzzed. They were very mild and reminded me a lot of pad see ew. The skin of the duck was extra crispy and made the dish IMHO. I also appreciated that the duck was deboned all the way. The biggest downside was the small noodle portion! We only got two bites, and for $30, we were expecting more duck, if not more noodles at least!

Jackfruit curry ~ $12: I would pass on this if you are expecting something like a curry. It was very watery, with very little flavor. The unripe jackfruit was very good, but the watery curry had little flavor...and again, it was watery, even more so than the soup. 

Green chili dip ~ $11 : Hard pass. It tasted like muddled bell peppers. Zero spice or any flavor other than bell pepper. Not even sure what the real dish is supposed to taste like, but I don't think this is it.

Shrimp Pad thai ~ $15: Good! Again, small portion.

Grilled shrimp with spicy green sauce ~ $12: This was probably my favorite since it was the least bland. The shrimp was big and grilled very well. It was served on top of some shredded cabbage. 

Tom yum and tom kah bowls, ~$5 and ~$6 respectively: Very good! Loved the soup here!

When I don't get why everyone else loves a place, and to me it was so-so, I tell myself that I probably ordered the wrong things. I'm definitely willing to give it a second shot when I'm back in Vegas. As always, YMMV. Happy eating!",2,0,3

The Drunken Noodles Topped with Duck and the Pepper Fried Prawns were amazingly delicious. Everything was piping hot, fresh, and super flavorful.. not just slabbed in sauce or deep fried in batter.

Overall, I would say this place is optimal for larger parties, ideally 4-6 people. We had 10+ people and it was great ordering dozens of dishes and sharing family style. But, I would imagine for a pair - it would be more challenging to try all the variety of dishes!

25 min go by, finally seated. Got some thai tea, balanced just right. Chicken satay for an appetizer, chicken grilled just right. Peanut sauce and cucumber medley paired with it perfectly.

Panang Curry with Shrimp
absolutely DELICIOUS, i am very picky with my curries because there always seems like there's something off.. Too much coconut milk, not enough spice, too much spice, too sweet. Not this place, perfect balance of flavors, no complaints here.

Roasted Duck with Red Pineapple Curry: my friend got this and loved it. i had to dip in my fork of course and the duck was perfect. Even tho it was covered in curry you could still taste the crispness of the duck skin, and the medley of fat and meat in your mouth was awesome. He did however say he got a 6 in hotness and it was almost too much for him!

Dessert:
Mango Sticky Rice and Fried Banana.
basically 2 thai dessert staples. It's very hard to mess this up and they didn't. Mangoes were fresh, and the fried banana had just the right amount of sweet and crisp.

Since I rarely wander off the Strip, I managed to miss it on every trip until a couple months back, when I made the trip with a few friends.

We booked well in advance, but were able to change a table for 3 to a table for 5 the day of our dinner. Our reservation was for 8:30 on a Monday, so probably not a peak time, though the place was very busy the whole time we were there. (You can also walk in, apparently, but it sounds like the waits get long.) The restaurant was in a huge strip mall, with the kind of parking lot ideal for teaching teens to drive, or testing specially modified DeLoreans. The space itself was comfortable--not small for a family-run Thai restaurant in the desert, but not big for what could be Vegas's most hyped off-Strip attraction.

I liked the atmosphere, which was homey but upbeat, with tons of accolades and celebrity photos on the wall (though the only person I recognized was Asian fiend Nick Cage). Ah, the bald boastfulness of accomplished immigrants--I know it well. Service was good, fast and attentive, even as a crowd of dishes created near chaos on our table.

The food was excellent, every bite loaded to bursting with flavor. We ordered a family style feast, and everything was delicious and satisfying in that way that makes you wonder, why eat at fancy restaurants when Thai food is just better? Lotus of Siam outshines most restaurants on the Strip, and its price point is a lot more friendly.

The moo yang was irresistible, a plate of marinated charbroiled pork, tenderly chewy with a caramelized char, served with a homemade spicy dipping sauce. The papaya salad was classic--green papaya, chili, tomato, crushed peanuts, lime juice, fish sauce, sugar--and nicely executed, made with a ton of heat. One of Lotus of Siam's signature dishes, which I'd never had anywhere else, was the garlic prawn. I can see why people talk come here for this--it was utterly addictive, deep fried prawns sauteéd in a house garlic sauce and topped with ground black pepper. Tons of flavor, and a flaky, chip-like texture. I don't tend to love prawn shells, but these were put to beautiful use.

The bulk of our meal came in the form of curries and carbs. The khao soi was another house specialty--crispy duck on egg noodles in a curry-based sauce, garnished with scallions, lime, and pickled vegetables. This was spectacular, somewhere between a noodle soup and a curry, with a thick, complex sauce that was thin enough to eat by the spoonful. I also loved the kang hung lay, a spicy stewy Northern pork curry. The portion was small, but the contents were rich, the pork cooked so tender it was falling apart in the curry. On the more everyday Thai side of things, I really enjoyed the panang curry with chicken, and the pineapple fried rice was solid.

The check came before we could order dessert--it's possible our server thought we'd had quite enough, which wasn't inaccurate. There's always next time--now that I've been to Lotus of Siam, I'll drag people off the Strip to go back.",9,3,6

There's an interesting looking buffet that they offer during the weekends (perhaps only on Sundays).

There were so many to choose from. We went with the Nam Prick Noom, Northern green chili dip dish, and the Nua Nam Tok beef dish. 

The beef dish came out really quick. But it was luke warm. It was very flavorful. Many herbs and spices not used in Thai restaurants where I'm from. It tasted authentic. But there was a overpowering taste of cilantro. Loved the spice to it.

The chili dish wasn't what I expected. It was a cold dish. Green chili with additional items to bring out the flavor, including chicharrones?? Although weird, I really liked it.

Tip: don't forget to order a side of rice. It doesn't automatically come with the dishes.

The service was ok. I asked for recommendations and he just pointed out the northern Flavors page and the chief's specials. But I wasn't really given further advice. We weren't in a rush or anything but that's usually how I indicate that the service is slow. When I'm on my phone and realize 5 minutes passed and my check hasn't been picked up.

Wait.  Is this a review?  Before you guys think I'm high or something.  See response below.....

This ain't Hangover 37.  It's Baby-Mooners.  Wife was nagging me about taking her with me on my business trip.  I know...I know...it's my problem.  Anyway.  Our friend had a wine dinner here the week before and some of the photos that they posted on FB were just plain sick.  (I'm talking about the wine).  I bet some of you reading this are thinking....Get to the fucking point!!!.  Ok ok ok.  Fine.  

Hey hey hey - We sit down and I ramble over the wine list.  Awesome Riesling list.  I ended up ordering the 1990 Auslese.  Just pure awesomeness for the first 45 mins.  Then I had to down it since my preggers wife couldn't drink with me.  

Interesting - Crispy Fried Rice.  I bet many of you think WTF are you doing ordering fly lice at a Thai restaurant.  We'll don't knock it till you try it.  Some may judge this dish as a garlic salty rice crispy treat?  Pretty bad comparison, but hey if you don't believe me go try it.  

Um - Crispy Shrimp.  At first bite, I didn't eat the shell.  The shrimp is de-veined and shell left on.  Then deep fried in a white pepper salt duo mixture.  Our waiter walked by and said...try the skin.  It's like popcorn shrimp.  The shell literally melts in your mouth.  I'm like whoa nellie shut the front door.   

O.M.G. - Crispy Duck Penang.  This dish is worth the price of admission.  This duck puts any Peking Duck to shame.  Even Ming Tsai's.  Sorry buddy.  You've been punked episode Duck is coming to fruition.  

Before our last dish arrived, I looked at my wife and asked her.  Why?  Why haven't we been here before?  

Are you kidding me? - Drunken noodles.  By this part of the meal, I've grossly over-eaten and feel like a hog ready to be pit roasted.  I think the secret ingredient in this dish is the Mekong River water they use to cook...oh wait....that's in Thailand where they use river water.  Nevermind.  And there's no mekong river in thailand.  Anyway...I'm almost 1000% sure she has her own private herb garden.  Cuz that basil is the shiznit.

And what a surprise that here, in this archaic mish mash of tired trashy tourist sin reeking of cheap vodka and regret, there lies a culinary palace in the most unsavory of places, but a landmark nonetheless, (and ever since it's small cameo on Top Chef, the hoards of tourists have increased tenfold, making wait times to over an hour at peak times).  In a rundown shopping center east of the Strip, Chef Saipin creates some the loveliest, humble yet sophisticated dishes that make up for the lack of ambience.

Now please, please do not be disparaged by the desolate location and crappy shopping center facade; yes, it is dilapidated and no, your car will not get jacked (many a friend have periodically checked to see if their car's still there) no worries, the homeless keep an eye out for ya!  They've even told me I had a brake light out, which deserved a buck...good people, those cracky addicts...

In fact it's recently gone trough an expansion, and when you've managed to squeeze past the herd, the room on the right is the expansion, while directly in front of you is the original dining room.  And the interior, although updated, has the exact the same finishes: green carpeting dark, mahogany wood chair rails, brass railings and oddly scaled glass drop chandeliers....it's like a time machine into retro...without the chic... which I have grown to absolutely love, like visiting grandma's house in the not so nice neighborhood during the Holidays.

Apart from your typical Thai Apps, (Shrimp Toast, Stuffed Chicken Wings)  The Moo Dad Deaw is an awesome starter, akin to a Bar snack item, to be eaten with a nice cold beer.  These succulent, juicy, tender pieces of pork are the precursor to chicken fingers, you can easily pop these suckers one after one in your mouth; as a good accompaniment, have some Sticky Rice to go with it; go ahead wreck your diet, you weren't serious about those New Year's resolutions anyways...

My favorite curry dish on the menu, which isn't you normal curry dish:  the Braised Short Rib with Penang Curry - this luxurious dish has all the depth and richness laid into it's protein not usually paired with Thai cuisine but definitely makes sense.  The hearty Short Rib goes so well with Penang, which is so good, Chef Saipin add Cognac into the Curry which elevates it to whole different level.  I bypass all the other curries cuz I know this one has the best flavor profile out of all of them.

Lotus of Siam has made me a Pad See Ew snob, ever since that first time I ate here, the quality and technique that is executed here is so superb; I honestly have to remind myself that it's not supposed to be this good!  First, the Noodles have that perfect texture; mochi chewiness but firm enough to achieve maximum noodle satisfaction.  Combine it with the Egg, Beef, Broccoli and sweet Soy, it's such an addictive dish that's light yet savory with just a hint of Black Pepper to tighten the palate...just yum.

Another all time favorite of mine:  Crab Fried Rice.  The way that Lotus makes this dish is pretty unbelievable, the rice is incredibly fluffy with a light infusion of crab broth.  I love finding morsels of Crab and Egg as if it's a treasure hunt and there's always a big hunk of Tomato wedge that's seems so out of scale with everything else that's on the plate.  But, as I've ordered this dish consecutively on numerous occasions, it's become a endearing and integral component that adds acidity to an otherwise aromatic, subtle dish.  It is a must-get item on the menu, but be warned, it's not an all out powerhouse of strong flavors, so you may want to order it as an earlier course before the heavier dishes arrive to your table. 

As dining experiences go, it's all over the place except for the food.  And in the end, with moderate prices, I can't really say that anything else affect the fact that Lotus has the best Thai food I've ever had.

All the awards, national media attention, the famous chefs of the world saying how great this place it. Now after a couple of visits I can confirm with all of them, LoS was probably one of the best meals of my life!

I've read a lot of reviews about many of the other Thai places in town. And, a lot of people would rather chose those spots to eat at, rather than go to LoS which they feel is overhyped. I've been to a lot of those places as well.. So what's the conclusion? I don't think this place is overhyped at all. I believe that LoS deserves every single accolade it has received. It probably deserves more..

Places like Komol, Weera Thai, Pan Asian, Archi's etc. etc., they make really good, in fact, they make really great Thai food! LoS is completely on an entirely different level. For example, take the classic, drunken noodles. At all the great Thai restaurants, they all make excellent versions of this dish, and they each have a common trait that says ""this is drunken noodles."" At LoS, it still says  ""this is drunken noodles"", but it's totally different from every one I've ever had in my life. And, I mean different in a totally amazing, uniquely personal, life changing sort-of-way... That goes for EVERY dish on the menu. Also, if you haven't had the crispy prawns, do try them, quite possibly the best thing I've eaten this year (them prawn shells..)

Whenever I eat at a restaurant, I always come in with an open mind regardless of what others have experienced, positive or negative. This restaurant isn't just one of the best restaurants in Vegas or the entire country, this is a world class restaurant. This restaurant will continue to rack up the accolades, and deservedly so. Well done Lotus of Siam.. Well done!",20,10,16

The place is located in Winchester and what looks to be a shady location.  When we first walked in, we thought it was small a little hole in a wall place, until we were seated inside.  The inside is nice with a big wine wall rack glass display.  Shows you how un""hole in a wall"" it really is.

So we tried the Coconut Milk Soup, Pad-See-Ew, House Fried Rice, and the Yellow Curry.  The dishes were good and we had no complaints with the food.  They also operate on a 1-10 spice scale, so you can spice to your liking...

The server tried to remedy the situation by giving us a cup of coconut ice cream (we were a party of 7) but I felt that was a poor way of making up for their mistake. They never apologized. Someone in my family could have choked or swallowed that rubber band. If that could happen to our table, it could have happened to other tables as well.

Driving there, i felt very unsafe, but when I turned into the parking lot and saw about 50 people waiting in line for the one establishment in the entire area, I felt a little more at ease. I made the mistake of not making a reservation because I didn't know when I was planning on eating there and had to stand in line. Fortunately, I got in line just in time to not have to wait, even with 50 people ahead of me. 

For the food, I got the garlic shrimp which is their most popular item, and for good reason. Its not only tasty, and crispy, but just perfectly cooked. A little on the expensive side, but sure worth the splurge. Their drunken soft shell crab (don't remember its proper name) was also super delicious. My favorite of the night was their stuffed chicken. Moist and juice, the sweet and tangy sauce perfectly added an extra depth of flavor to the dish. We ended our dinner off with an order of their mango sticky rice and I was in love. I have never had this anywhere else to compare, but I was so happy I ordered this dish. The sticky rice was seasoned with a slight hint of jasmine flavoring so I really enjoyed that. The only thing I had that was disappointing was their Thai Tea. It was ridiculously sweet that I was unable to drink it. 

Tips: make reservations or get there around 5ish before they open. Or else you'll have to wait about 1 hour for seats to open. Order asap or again, you'll be stuck waiting for people to get their food if they ordered before you.

I highly recommend this place. I also encourage people to make reservations if possible. If you don't then expect to wait a really long time, even on a Tuesday night it was an hour wait. 

FOOD: The food is incredible. The dishes we ate were: Garlic Prawns, Chicken Pad Thai, Duck Fried Panang Curry w\/ egg noodle. Squid Garlic and combination fried rice.  

My favorite dish is the Fried Duck Panang Curry w\/ Egg Noodle. I wish we ordered two because sharing one place between five people just wasn't enough! The duck is fried so well and the crispy skin with the panang curry really completes the dish. We love egg noodle versus white rice so we added the egg noodle in, which is optional. 

The Garlic Prawns is another delicious item you must try. The batter it is fried in is so tasty! It is seasoned well and tastes great when you dip it in the panang sauce. The Squid garlic was very tender. The chicken pad thai and fried rice was like other Thai restaurants. There was nothing special about those dishes. 

PRICE: It was a little expensive, but if I had only gotten the garlic prawns and fried duck curry I am not sure if I would be saying that. For sure this restaurant charges higher end prices for great tasting food. 

SERVICE: The service was good. I did not have much to complain about it. We waited for an hour and the hostess came to get us right away. There's also a bar that you can sit at and grab a drink while you wait as well. The server was fast to take our order and bring our food out. He checked on us a few times, which is always a plus. 

AMBIANCE: The restaurant is big, but the tables are smaller and closer together. It's always so busy so it's extra loud. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're trying to have an intimate time with someone. 

Overall, I would definitely come back here again for the fried duck curry and garlic prawns. 

Happy Dining,

Pork Stew: Don't be deceived by the size of this stew. It's packed with deep curry flavor and pairs well with white rice. 4\/5

The lunch buffet selection looked totally different with more Chinese food than usual and the Pad Thai, which was the one thing that I always looked forward too wasn't the same. The Pad Thai was light in color and bland. Usually, the Pad Thai is very orange and the flavorful, so flavorful that sometimes when I'm back in CA I contemplate on going to Vegas just so I can eat the Pad Thai at Lotus of Siam. Also, besides the Pad Thai being bland all the other food just didn't taste the same and was a little off. I don't know if the little Thai lady isn't cooking the food anymore because I didn't see her or maybe they sold it? But, whatever you changed Lotus of Siam, PLEASE change it back to what it use to be, it's just not the same.

First, MAKE a reservation and make sure you can get there slightly before your reservation as they will only hold your table for 5 minutes.  There is still always a wait.  Anticipate about a $16-$18 cab ride from the strip and about 15-20 minutes to get there depending on traffic.  Try to not go on a Friday or Saturday as it is always overly packed. 

Second, its not on the strip, it's in a mini mall in the middle of nowhere.  At first, you look at the outside and it looks like a place you are not sure you want to trust eating at, but trust me...you will thank me. 

They have a pretty high tech checkin system with an iPad and they actually have things organized when you get in.

Now for the food, when you get the menu go straight to the chef's specialties or the Northern selection.  It's what they specialize in so take advantage. 

They will ask you a scale of 1-10 for spiciness..the food is SPICY.  A 10 is only for those who have replaced their stomach with Iron.  A jalapeno is more at a level 2, a habernero is at a level 5...Scotch bonnets are level 8...I don't even know what they use.  Mind you the spice is there but so is the taste..its not like you burned your mouth and then nothing.

The wine list is also pretty impressive for a strip mall thai restaurant.  And well priced.  For $150, you can easily feed 4 people with a reasonably good bottle of wine too.

One review I read somewhere said this was the best Thai food in North America. I've had some excellent Thai food in Chicago and this place was easily one of the top five I have had. Wife and I went here on our last night in Vegas and it was a real treat. We started with a fish cake, Issan style beef jerky, and a crispy rice with sour sausage. The first two were very, very good and the third was OK. The jerky was excellent and not too tough. It had very interesting spices and the sauce gave it a nice kick.

We decided to go with the Northern Thai menu options since they seemed really unique. I went with Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry) which is described as being ""almost sweet"". It wasn't but it was very spicy. Not quite Thai spicy, but a litle strong. It did not have as much sauce or broth as I was excpecting but it was a nice portion size and was well seasoned besides the spice. Wife went with Khao a Burmese influenced Northern Thai egg noodle served in curry sauce and coconut cream. Waiter recommended beef and it was an excellent dish. For dessert we shared a nice dish of coconut ice cream which was a perfect end to the meal.

We arrived at 7:30 for our reservation on a Friday and there was consistently between 5 and 10 people waiting for a table. Call ahead an make reservations. It may not look like much from the outside and the mall it's in is a little sketchy (multiple 'social rooms' like the Green Door and other similar places) but this is an excellent and popular restaurant. If you enjoy Thai food, this place is not to be missed. Why only 4 stars? Well, it isn't actually the best I've ever had but it is very, very good.

Great beef salad, excellent curries, grilled chicken, wonderful homemade ice cream.  We've tried a lot of different dishes and everything we've had was great.  Ask for recommendations from the waiter also: that 's how we tried the catfish and the Nam Kao Tod, crispy rice with pork sausage.  They also have a great selection of Northern Thai dishes that you rarely find in other places.  

Once, we tried to order the mango with sticky rice but they warned us beforehand that the mangos weren't fully ripe and gave us a sampling of the mango to test whether we really wanted it.  It tasted OK, perhaps a little less sweet than a ripe mango in-season.  We decided to go with some of their home-made coconut ice cream instead.  I think this anecdote really shows the detail and care they put into their food.  

They have a lunch buffet on the weekends (geared more toward the locals or the typical tourist) which I wouldn't recommend, but you can still special order dishes during that time.

Maybe two small hands worth.  Again, why are Asian restaurants charging for rice in Vegas??? You need the rice though b\/c otherwise you are eating minced meat with...um....nothing.  There's nothing to eat it with b\/c it's just a little bowl of minced meat.  

Service was very nice and the server gave us very good recommendations.  There was no wait for lunch on a weekday.",0,1,0

Tried to come a few times, but didn't want to deal with the long wait.  However, I finally managed to try this place during our last trip by coming here for lunch.  This might be a controversial statement, but I think Arawan across the parking lot is better on the account of flavor and presentation.  However, Lotus of Siam is definitely nothing to sneeze at, it is a delicious Thai restaurant (I am just not sure it would be worth the hour long wait).  

There are nearly 4000 reviews, so I am sure I won't say anything here that hasn't been said before, so I will try to keep this brief.  Out of the dishes we tried, I really loved:

Khao Soi Soup - it was absolutely delicious, just the right amount of creaminess and heat.  We had it with chicken, although I wish we got the duck instead.  

Garlic Prawns - I can see why this is a signature dish, wow, just wow.  The breading was light and crispy.  The prawns themselves were good sized, plump and juicy.

Conversely, I had high hopes for Nam Prik Ong, and it was such a let down.  The dip lacked depth as I've had elsewhere, and the flavors did not mesh well together.  It was the one dish that we barely touched on the table.

Overall, I am glad I got to try this place after hearing countless friends rave about it.  It is rare to find authentic and delicious Thai food, would definitely come back again,albeit only for lunch due to the lack of wait time.",1,0,1

The garlic prawns alone deserve a five star rating! Absolutely the best I've ever had. Crispy with the perfect balance of flavors and spices. I also loved the pad see ewe and papaya salad. So good!

Their service is awesome. We ordered a spice level of 4 for all the dishes. I could not handle it after the first dish. We talked to the waiter and he was able to tone it down for our last few dishes. In the mean time, he gave me a free thai ice tea to help relieve all the spice. How nice was that. 

We went on a Wednesday night and it was crowded. We had to wait 30+ minutes. When we talked to the waiter that night, he told us that it was one of the slowest nights they had ever had. Go figure. He said that some of the workers didn't know what to do with themselves. haha

All in all, it ended up being a huge letdown and I was embarrassed at bringing a large party of 8 to this restaurant and making reservations one month in advance.  

1) Location - Lotus of Siam is located in the middle of a strip mall and it isn't an easy location for most cabs to find.  The neighborhood is questionable and in the evenings is probably not the safest locale.

2) Decor - reflective of its strip mall location, the interior is nothing special.  There are, however, typical Thai touches (flowers and statues) and plenty of newspaper articles touting it's reputation as a great Thai restaurant.

3) Food - While many reviews talk about the amazing flavors and the incredible tastes, I found everything to be absolutely average.  Given the high expectations, I was obviously disappointed, but even without those expectations, I'd be hard pressed to even call the food good.  All the dishes chosen were ""signature"" dishes recommended by our waiter and each failed to impress.

With every bite I took, I just wondered how the heck the Gourmet magazine food review could be so off and what kool-aid all the reviewers were drinking.  Even now, I can think of a dozen Thai restaurants better than Lotus of Siam and probably only one or two that I've considered worse.  

In the end, as I waited 45 minutes for a cab to pick up our group from the seedy strip mall location, I figured it all must be a tourist trap.  One  stellar review must have spawned the rest or maybe, none of the people who were gushing over Lotus had ever been to a Thai restaurant.  

For the Las Vegas that is home  to the $4.99 Steak and Egg breakfast and the 24 hour buffet, Lotus of Siam may be a revolutionary restaurant.  But for North America??  Lotus of Siam falls amazingly flat.",11,2,4

And, yes, you CAN get many items veganized here: the ala carte menu is a great place to get some veggie and\/or tofu combinations, from Pad Prik King to Chili Mint, to green curry (one of my faves!).  Just be sure to tell them no fish sauce and ask about which curry bases are OK. (Sometimes red curry is made w\/ shrimp paste).  The spicy vegetable soup is amazing and lives up to it's name! The phrase ""I can't feel my lips anymore, but I can't stop eating this!"" is commonly uttered.  You can actually get a few delicious dessert options here too! Sticky rice w\/ mango, coconut ice cream (made w\/ coconut milk FTW!), fried bananas.... all delish.

Bonus: they have Albarino(!!!!!) and Stone IPA on their drink menu, so I get my choice of two of my favourite bevvy's to complete my meal.  

They have recently expanded and about doubled their seating capacity, so it's easier than it used to be to get a table too!  I would recommend a reservation on a Fri or Sat.... but if it's packed you can always trot over to Komol for some excellent chow as well.

I will say this though -- I have been vegan about 7 years and don't stray from that.  I also generally try to encourage others to eat in a similar manner.  HOWEVER - when I take meat eaters to Lotus, I pretty much insist that they order off the Northern Thai menu.  Only one item on there doesn't have meat, but the dishes are very rarely found on American Thai menus... So just go for it already! If you're an adventurous eater, you'll probably love it.",9,0,3

What we ordered: crispy wontons, tom yum soup, pineapple fried rice with chicken, seafood drunken noodles (spicy level 5), garlic prawns and roasted duck in panang curry.

As appetizers, the crispy wontons and tom yum soup were very good. The soup however left me slightly disappointed because it wasn't HOT when it came out. It was more like, warm.... why?

Out of our entrees, the roasted duck in panang curry is AN ABSOLUTE MUST. It was a favorite of the entire table. Perfect in every way possible, I wish I could eat this everyday! The garlic prawns were ordered per the server's recommendation and I'm so glad we did! It was perfectly seasoned, perfectly crispy and not drenched in oil. I even tried eating the shell and it was so good! :) 

I loveeeee seafood drunken noodles but these drunken noodles were just okay in my opinion. Again, it didn't come out very hot so that was disappointing. And the spicy level of 5 (which I heard would be pretty spicy) was not spicy at all. Also, I'm not a fan when restaurants (especially with such a hyped up name) uses imitation crab meat or anything for that matter, so that was slightly disappointing. The pineapple fried rice had yellow curry in it so that was interesting, but not quite my preference. It was just OK and I'd never order it there again. 

So with that said, the roasted duck in panang curry (under chef's selection) was amazing so make sure you try that! And the garlic prawns as well! Make sure you call ahead to make reservations. It may be hard to get a hold of them, but persistence will pay off in the end.",4,0,1

So I'm a big fan of thai food, in particular their curries.  I've tried quite a bit of different curries from many thai food restaurants and this one definitely is at the top of the list.  I had the yellow chicken curry with a spicy request rating of 8 and boy did it kick my ass!  This is really the first thai curry I've tried that I can say is truly spicy.  Besides the spicyness, the curry was very flavorful which also made it fantastic.  I also tried their sticky rice and pad thai which were both very well made as well.  Their service was excellent and prices were very fair.  I couldn't really ask for more.

The one bad part about this was that there were only two of us, meaning we couldn't order a lot (well, we could have, but then we'd have a buttload leftover). So we settled on a cup of the Tom Yum Koong, Soft Shell Crab Drunken Noodles, and the Fried Garlic Prawns.
 
Needless to say, we really enjoyed all three. The soup had just the right amount of tanginess and kick, and the cup was full of huge shrimp (oxymoron, I know).
 
My wife had never eaten soft shell crab before, so she was a little weirded out by it here, but I really liked it and we both loved the noodles; great texture and flavor there.
 
And I liked the prawns more and more as I ate them, but I have to say... I'm not sure how I feel about eating the shells like chips. There's definitely a certain taste to it, but I don't think I'm a fan of it just yet. I'll have to try it again.
 
We got there fifteen minutes prior to opening on a Saturday evening, and we were seated immediately. The restaurant is spacious and clean, so try to get there as close to opening time as possible. Otherwise, I would recommend making reservations.
 
Having said all that, I'm not sure that I can back the statement of this being the best Thai restaurant in the country, but it is dang good. Take that however you'd like. And I will be back, but hopefully with more people so I can try more dishes. So many to choose from!",3,3,4

My friends had been talking about it for months on how amazing this place is but as a California resident I never come out as often as I'd like. I finally got to try it the other day, and all I can say is that this place is just RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING!!! 

We had drunk noodles with Chilean Sea Bass, soft crab, crispy duck with panning curry, crab fried rice, garlic prawns, and the garlic beef to share between 6 guys. Normally, I would say Thai dishes specializes in a few things and I would be able to rate between least favorite to most, but I have to say everything was simply delicious. Between 6 guys it wasn't a lot, but just right. It was really something where you could appreciate each dish by itself. Eating it together was just heaven. 

I would say it's a little on the pricey side. We shared between 6 guys with each person getting a Thai iced tea or coffee and it came out to $200 or $33 per person. I suppose it could be cheaper if you go a la carte, but if you want to do Thai family style then you order dishes on dishes, but as a once in a while thing when I go to Vegas: WORTH IT!

The wait is long, but I'm sure most people already know and are prepared for that (The wait time for my large party was 2 hours.).  The dishes I admit are delicious, however I left very unsatisfied and still hungry. 

Garlic Prawns - These were quite delicious.  I hate that there are pieces that are empty.  Worth a try but not worth eating more than once, very simple dish that you can probably make yourself with a deep fryer.

Papaya Salad - Nothing special here, don't get me wrong it is good (you can't really mess up with papaya salad).  Again such a small portion, what are they expecting to feed, a baby rabbit??

Pad Thai - Tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.

Soft Shelled Crab Drunken Noodle - The soft shelled crap was crispy, and alright.  This was okay for me, it was quite salty but the blandness of the greens evened it out.

Sweet Coconut Rice, Fried Bananas - I enjoyed this very much however, again overpriced for something that tastes the same almost everywhere else.

Tom Kah Kai Hotpot - The soup was delicious, however the chicken was like rubber!

We are from Cali and there are Thai restaurants everywhere, for the amount of our bill, we could have had good Thai food for a week!

We have a party of four and  did not make reservation on Christmas day and we waited for 1 hour. The wait did not bother us but the restaurant did. 

First, the ambiance - this is nothing but more than a regular Thai restaurant in any of the US cities. It is a large, noisy, and very crowded setting in a banquet hall. Seats are very uncomfortable, some chairs are even rocking and we were fearful that it could break in any given time. Very plain setting on the table, with one fork and paper napkin. This is certainly not a fine dining restaurant. 

The decor of this place is also very plain. Only a few pictures and some ribbons hanging in a on the walls. Feels like eating in a mess hall. 

A  bare minimum service level is provided. Our waiter came to take our order and offered us some suggestions. The dishes were presented to us by the carriers and the waiter checked back with us only once. Water was never refilled. 

Now the food. We ordered:

1. Golden Tofu as an appetizer - these are cubes of tofu deep fried. Indeed these are chunks of tender tofu, unfortunately, it has zero flavoring. One must use the accompanying sauce ( a sweet lime sauce ) for flavoring. Many other Thai restaurants can do a better job. Price of this dish is $7.95.  Grade B-.

2. Garlic Prawn deep fried - there are 6 pcs of shrimp, size 16 to 20, The shells comes with this dish and they are deep fried solidly and are crispy. Unfortunately, it is slightly too greasy,
In addition, the shrimp is not flavorful and is slightly over fried. Price of this dish is $27.95. Grade C. 

3. Crispy Duck in a curry sauce - there are about 12 pcs of thinly sliced duck breast in a coconut cream yellow curry sauce. This is the best dish of the evening. The sauce is great over rice and the duck breast is tender. If you like Thai yellow curry sauce, you will love this dish. Price is $27.95. Grade A. 

4, Kang Hung Lay - Pork stew in a northern Thai curry sauce. Small chunks of pork along with one large piece of pork belly simmered in a curry sauce. Very flavorful, but the meat is not tender. Price is $17.95. Grade C.

5. Mua Yum Kattie - grilled strips of beef in a sweet and sour Thai sauce. Beef is quite tasty but kind of tough. Price is very reasonable at $10.95. Grade B-. 

In addition, we ordered two Thai ice coffee which is quite well done. Grade A. 

The food bill came to $102+. Then they add a mandatory 18% service charge in addition to the local tax. The total is then $130.

All in all, the food is OK and acceptable. I will recommend this place to my friends if only they can accept the mandatory 18% service charge,  zero ambiance, below acceptable service level and the high price they charge on the food,",3,0,1

Yet, the most delicious meal I've ever had in Vegas was at Lotus of Siam.

First thing to know: this is really three restaurants in one.

#1, there's a lunch buffet where rubes come in and pay $7.50 to eat potstickers and egg rolls.  Pretend this doesn't exist.

#2, there's a normal Thai menu with stuff like phad thai and panang curry.  While this stuff is good, it's not unlike what you might eat at a good Thai restaurant in Seattle or San Francisco or New York.

#3, there's a section of the menu with Northern Thai dishes and Chef's Special dishes.  This is the heart of the menu and what makes foodies cry with delight.  If you're coming all the way here (and it's a long walk from the middle of the strip), you must order off of these sections of the menu.

We've been here several times.  Most recently, we had the dry sausage, a green curry dip, and finally the special Beef Stew with peppercorn sauce (option A I think.)

While all of these are highly recommended, the beef stew was one of the most delicious things I've ever had.  The meat was absolutely fork tender, flavored with aromatic and perfectly balanced Thai spices--the right mix of sweet and spicy and pungent.  Just amazing.  Totally beyond the flavors and textures you expect.

They grow a lot of their own herbs and spices because they're not available outside of Thailand.  As a result, you'll taste flavors and combinations you've probably not had before.

Again, order off of the Northern Thai or Chef's menus.  And prepare to be amazed.",2,2,3

First off, what an interesting interior. The massive wine cellar and list is impressive. It still gave me a hole in the wall feel but it was a very large hole in the wall, unusually. The chandeliers were pretty to look at but it was hard to avoid the emergency exit sign\/door that was next to my face from where we were seated. It didn't matter though, I was aching for some tummy comfort.

Papaya salad, Musamun Curry and Salt & Pepper Prawns. Holy eff. It did more than the trick and I literally cried when the bear wouldn't let me eat the leftovers after we got back to the fridge-less hotel & they had been sitting out for a couple hours, I was aching for more of that deliciousness...

I worked at Casino Royale on the Strip as a bartender and sometimes just showed up at the Cheetah and jumped on the pole. There was a pomegranate tree growing outside my window on Gypsy Lane, and hummingbirds would fly up to feed at it. Air travel was wonderful in those days, so I would often take off for the weekend, to LA, SF, CO or NM. Nobody knew how amazing Lotus of Siam was, and it was my favorite place to eat.

I moved back to NYC later that year, but I returned to Las Vegas in 2003 to get married. Having seen many other friends tie the knot since then, I will say this. Las Vegas weddings are the best. Don't just do a bachelor party. Make it one big party for everyone. No parents, no kids. Everyone arranges their own travel, and then block out some hotel rooms for your guests and have fun. 

Now that you have an idea of what I call romance, Lotus of Siam is a great date spot. It's been forever since I've been back to Vegas, but I recall this was tucked into a strip mall with a shooting range, a bail bonds, a pawn shop, a check cashing and a trashy lingerie shop. Basically, everything you want one stop shopping, even if you have to beg, borrow or steal, and why not go for the hat trick?

Why am I remembering them? Because that was a seriously awesome time. They opened a NY restaurant, had a falling out with their business partner, who tried to make it fancy, and I respect that they wanted more management control, though they're so old, it was too much for them, running two locations. I appreciate how passionately they feel about the food and their reputation. That also means long waits and big crowds, so I will fondly remember those halcyon days and that delicious Thai food.",0,2,2

I haven't been here in years, the last time was probably 5 years ago when they still had the lunch buffet.  That was great and a good value.  However, their dinner menu is really something that was disappointing.  After waiting an hour on a Wednesday night we were seated.

We came with pretty high expectations and unfortunately they were not met.  The food is pretty expensive, between $22-$32 per plate, which we all shared.  Got the highest recommended dishes like the garlic prawns, crispy duck, etc etc.  We spent almost $150 on 5 dishes after tax and really didn't think any of them were that great.  The flavor was lacking and portions were small.  If you are paying $30 a plate for Thai food, the portions should be a really good size.  However, these portions were almost comically small, especially for the price.
The flavor of the dishes is really where I had issues.  The food wasn't bland, but it also wasn't flavorful or even very good.  It was very ok.

We left disappointed and not particularly full.  I can't recommend this place in any way.

Run down strip mall with an adult day care facility right next door hard to believe the lotus of siam is one of the best seemingly great Thai restaurants in Vegas.

Don't take my word for it go there and look at all the celebrities that have eaten there like New York cities Momofuku's Dave Chang with Lotus's owner and chef Saipien Chutma just hanging on the bottom row as you enter to the left. 

I have eaten there several times and if you can ignore the outside the ambience inside since they remodel is clean, quaint, and slightly upward sit-down nice. 

Food is definitely above par. They have all Thai classics at a standard Thai restaurant price and trust me  you don't JUST come here for the pad Thai and Tom yum. 

Chef special are excellent! Crispy duck in curry woo and the must have---garlic prawns

(Skip this if you don't want to hear about prawns sooooo good) Garlic pawns pricey but worth a drive to Vegas. They shell giant prawns but leave the shells attached. Coat the shelled fish in batter of garlicky goodness (not too much garlic) Deep fried both shells and prawns in extreme intensity so it looks like you have double the shrimp. If you don't like fried yummy shells you may feel a tiny bit jiped but they throw cilantro and green onions to make up for it (jk) the whole thing is delicious and stays crispy for hours. Really. I checked. So delicious.

Overall it's what you expect from a Thai restaurant with a whole LOT you didn't expect. Like a very streamed lined staff. Food took a little time but the servers brought us appetizers, were always accessible, and were knowledgable to point out the water was filtered NOT tap. In a place that is always busy and with an award winning chef it is a culinary experience that is very worth it.",2,0,0

I've been here twice, and each time I came out FULLY satisfied.  First time I went, I followed other yelper's advice, and asked our waiter for suggestions.  This is not a place you get your pad thai and call it a day, you want to experience their specialties that you can't get anywhere else.  Our waitress was very patient and recommended all winners.  Second time, I brought my parents here and at the end of the meal, my mom said, ""I never understood your fascination with Thai food before, but now I finally do.""  Yes, it's that good =).

Here are some of my must orders: 
- Tom Ka soup: my friend told me you can tell if a Thai restaurant is good by its soup.  I haven't tried too many Tom Ka's, but this one's sure tasty to me!
- Crispy duck panang:  MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE.  The duck is fried until crispy, and plated on a bed of panang sauce.  In fact, I'm sure any of its crispy duck options will be good.
- Sea bass with drunken noodles (or any other combo with drunken noodles): if you're a sea bass lover, this dish is for you.  The drunken noodle is somewhat similar to pad kee mao, but better.  We've also had it with prawns, HUGE prawns came out, the meat was so fresh and bouncy, yum yum.
- Braised short ribs: we had it with some kind of curry.  The ribs were fall of the bone tender, and the flavor was very rich, you can tell it's been stewing for hours.  

Also, try the Nam Kao Tod if you haven't, it's definitely different.  Some love it, I'm just okay with it.  But I still get it just to introduce it for the others.   

There're still so many other dishes that I have yet to try.  It's a definite must go every time I go to Vegas now.  Yes, it's a bit of a hassle since it's in the middle of nowhere, but if you love great food, do yourself (and your stomach) a favor and grab a taxi now!

We ordered the Crispy Duck Panang, Nam Prik Ong and Combination Fried Rice. The portions aren't as huge as you're probably used to from other Thai places, but that was enough to fill two people up. 

The Crispy Duck Panang was the clear highlight of the meal -- tender duck, crisp skin, spicy & creamy panang sauce. On their 1-10 spicy level, we got a 6 and it had a perfect amount of spice to it. Definitely don't discard the basil garnish -- mix it in with the sauce, eat it with your rice. Yum! It comes with a small pot of sticky rice, so you don't really need to order extra rice, but I'm a fan of Thai fried rice, so we got the combination too.

The Combination Fried Rice was good -- not any better than other Thai fried rices I've had. The chicken wasn't particularly moist or tender, and it only came with 2 shrimps. I would probably stick to just beef fried rice or shrimp fried rice, since the chicken didn't really add anything to the dish.

The Nam Prik Ong was what I really came here for -- I'd heard Ming Tsai raving about it on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate -- and honestly, I was underwhelmed. Not sure if they were just having an off-batch, but it wasn't as complex or flavorful as I expected it to be. I was expecting it to be spicy, with earthy flavors, herbacious Thai basil & cilantro, maybe some lime for acidity. It had a bit of heat to it, but it was pretty one-note. It reminded me more of a tomato-based chili than anything. 

All in all, I can see why people flock to this place. The menu is really huge and the prices aren't too bad (considering you're in Vegas).

The strip mall it's located in is honestly really sad and run-down looking, but once you're inside, the ambiance isn't bad.",0,0,0

The food served in the restaurant was a lot better than the experience I had with take out. I ordered the yellow curry and spicy noodles with shrimp for my first take out order. The styrofoam box the noodles were in looked like it had been stepped on, their was sauce all over the bag and it leaked on my counter. After preparing my first plate of food I noticed a black and white hair in my food. My friend and I were disgusted because it looked like an animal hair. I immediately called back Lotus and told them I would be bringing the food back for a refund. When I went into the restaurant I showed them how sloppily they had packaged it and the unknown hair in my food. They said it was probably a hair from one of the girls clothing and I told them it looked like a cat hair. After this they handed me my money and I could see they wanted me out of their restaurant.

Fast forward a few months later, Lotus is still the closest Thai restaurant to my place and I don't like Komol. I told my friend I wanted to order take out again and she was completely surprised I wanted to give them another chance. I ordered the panang curry with vegetables and asked what vegetables were in the dish. Penny, the owners daughter said carrots, cabbage, and broccoli. I also ordered the Thai spaghetti with chicken. This time my order was packaged correctly but I noticed the panang curry was more oily than usual and contained very little sauce. I also saw that there was baby corn, various peppers, onions, and green beans. Penny described inaccurately what vegetables were in the dish. What if I was allergic? People need to be careful these days and not say things unless they are 100% sure.

We started off with the En Tuan soup.  En Tuan means slow cooked.  You have to like tendon to be able to enjoy this one.  Generous slices of slow cooked beef and tendon in a flavorful basil, hot and sour broth.  Oh so good!  Luckily, I checked other Yelp reviews, so I knew to order medium spicy.  Even at medium, it was really spicy, just the perfect amount for me.  I like it spicy where you have to take a sip of your drink every other bite, but not so spicy where your lips and tongue are on fire!  

I'm not a huge fan of panang curry.  I usually prefer regular yellow curry.  But after reading other Yelper's reviews that this is the best dish, I had to try the Crispy duck on panang.  This dish was alright in my opinion.  The crispy duck skin was delicious but the duck itself was a little on the dry side.  Plus, there was hardly any meat, mostly skin.  

We also ordered the Garlic Prawns.  My picture posted, doesn't do this dish justice.  Huge prawns with the shell still attached but slighty pulled back and deep fried.  The prawn shells were so light and crispy, I must find out how they do it!  Overall, this dish tastes very similar to Salt & Pepper shrimp at a Chinese restaurant.  

Lastly, we had Pad Thai.  Boring, I know.  It was different in the fact that they used thin clear noodles instead of the wide linguine type noodles and it wasn't saucy.  Not much to write about here. 

I've come to the conclusion that I have to come back with a bigger group of people and try more on their menu.  There are a lot of dishes towards the back of the menu with Northern Thai cuisine that I've yet to experience.",4,4,3

What our table of eleven ordered: fried tofu, crispy duck panang curry, yom yum kai, garlic prawns, pad see ew, chicken thai fried rice, chilean sea bass in sa-mm rod sauce, coconut ice cream, fried banana & mango with sticky rice and thai iced teas.

What we got: yum x 1000, great service, great food, great efficiency, clean bathrooms, bright ambience (inside at least), okay parking and a fantastic experience all around.

The awards and all the doodads, certificates, etc. are there for a reason - this place is legit.  This may be the best Thai food we've ever ever ever eaten (including my dad, whose opinion on Asian food I hold in the highest regard, was surprised and pleased with this place - trust me, that's a hard act to do).

This was back in November, so I have forgotten the dishes that we ate, but this meal still gets discussed fondly to this day.

As you walk in it looks like a normal restaurant, except I noticed a bunch of James Beard Awards on the wall...okay getting better. The menu was extensive. They had every thai food you could think of and then some more. Well instead of us searching, contemplating, arguing and then making up about the menu, we asked our server (that was the advice people kept givving us). 

Sure enough, the server recommended item after item, and instead of getting just one thing per person we went family style and shared everything. It was a celebration of Thai food. The curried lamb and chicken were amazing. The noodles and tofu were just right. Everything was spot on and on point. I now see why they received all of those James Beard Awards. We also imbibed on some Thai Beer ""Singha"", they have a large or a small...i would go for the large. They are good.

If you're in the mood for flavors not typical of a normal Thai restaurant experience I recommend one of the chili dips with a side of sticky rice to order alongside your typical Thai curry fare ; pungent, deep flavors reminiscent of korean pork marinated with fermented chili paste mix.

...very interesting that it's served with a side of sticky rice, somewhat less consumed in Southeast Asia but coincidently, a staple in east Asia: almost as if the pallet demands it to accompany it's instinctive, fermented counterpart...

To explore these things of course skip right to the back of the menu to the highly touted ""northern"" segment, or the chef's recommendations on the following page.  I personally recommend the crispy duck served with curry on atop a bed of noodles - heaven on a plate my friends.

This place is all substance, some hype yes.  But that actually make it even more impressive...a place living up to it's expectation, now that's a rarety.

We were disappointed when we were shown our table in the annex behind the bar that had a good 15-20 tables free the entire time!

For lunch, ordered the basil prawns drunken noodles and they came out bland and cold. Sadly, this dish wasn't fresh as the noodles were mostly stuck together and below room temperature. The prawns were also cold...this should have been sent back to the kitchen...

Despite the relatively large price tag, it should be noted that portions were sufficient for a party of two!

So I had quite high expectations on top of the fact that I'm Thai. Among the 4 dishes ordered were the 2 most popular dishes, garlic prawns and crispy duck panang. Crispy duck Panang was really good. The duck was crispy like everybody raved about, and the Panang was flavorful and wasn't on the sweet side like many Thai restaurants tend to make. Garlic prawns, however, were bland. We tasted no garlic flavor. Worse, it felt cold as if the dish was done way earlier and just sat there on the counter waiting for other dishes (they served all the dishes at the same time!). And maybe because it's on the cold side, the prawn shells weren't as easy to eat as my friend had remembered. The prices for these two special dishes are also quite outrageous ($26.95 for crispy duck panang and about the same for garlic prawns). The other two dishes we ordered, Kang HangLae (northern food) and spicy fried rice were yummy. The service was also excellent. 

Overall, I'd give it a 4 star. Their dishes are good, but I don't think it's anything too memorable for me (as a Thai) and the prices for their special dishes are way too much.

So worth it, that after a bite or two, we had to order another plate for us! Who knew that prawns could be sooo tasty that you wouldn't think twice about eating the shell?

The menu is quite extensive, so we were only able to sample several dishes here. We tried the red chili dip (Ming Tsai's recommendation), chicken satay, the chicken soup with a coconut base and hints of lemongrass (amazing!), seafood salad, braised short ribs (panang). All were tastefully done and lived up to the spice level scale. Since they didnt have the mango sticky rice (our server said they only have this during the summer), I settled for an order of fried bananas with coconut ice cream; it did not disappoint.

I was highly impressed with the service that we received once we were seated,
given that it was a typical busy Friday night. Our drinks were refilled constantly and both of our servers seemed to be on the same page. We were always greeted with smiles from our two servers and they seemed genuinely happy to know that we really enjoyed our first meal at Lotus of Siam.

My biggest lesson learned from this visit was reservations, reservations, reservations!! It was obvious that the word is out about the fantastic food here at Lotus of Siam, so make reservations as early as you can to avoid being put on the waitlist. Unfortunately, I tried making reservations for a Friday night on that same day and they were all booked.
Our party of three had to wait between 45-60 minutes, which seemed like a long time given that we were starving and frustrated to see people walk in and get seated once they entered.

Lotus of Siam is hands down one of the best Thai restaurants that I've been to. The decor is simple and doesn't look like your typical Thai restaurants. This isn't a bad thing, as the place is still classy with a plethora of wine bottles on display and a noteworthy clean bathroom (which sadly isn't typical at a handful of Asian restaurants).

A voice was ironically screaming, ""Oooh shush \/ keep it down down \/ voices carry.""    

Then it was quiet again.  My iPod looked at me all illuminated and poured out frosty New Wave hits over my belly to facilitate the digestion process.  ""What the hell are you yelling about?"" it muttered, glancing at my doggie bag, wondering why it smelled like dog poo. ""Never mind,"" I said.  ""Everything's rosy.  It's your turn to pick a place to eat.""  

And it was.  I was done picking Vegas restaurants.  Whatever bastard over at Gourmet named The Lotus of Siam ""Best Thai Food in North America"" must have gotten the Bangkok Special in the back because my food was as muddled as a clean-and-sober Courtney Love.  The only thing that made things worse was the lingering stench of krab meat.  (There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of a krab binge.  Except, perhaps, being the drunken bastard that created this Drunken Noodle plate. Rubbery calamari, unripe papaya, and faux seafood aside, I'd name my child Shiloh Pitt before I'd take a Piloh Shitt at this place again.)",6,16,5

Drove into Vegas on Friday night and arrived around 6 after the wife and mother made a stop and did some damage at the Primm outlets... Only wished they waited to see if there was extra money AFTER the trip from Vegas (sigh)... Called to see if we could sneak in for a reservation and we ended up with one for Saturday night instead. We were set on coming to eat here at least once on every trip. 

Stick to the specialty dishes... you won't be disappointed - You can get your Pad Thai and Thai BBQ chicken elsewhere at the cheap corner Thai place back home 

We had 5 of us dining together family style and indulged on a few of the house specialties and we were not disappointed. 

The Lineup: 

Kai Soi Braised Short Ribs 
- The meat was flavorful and served with a fried egg noodle in a generous serving of sauce. 4.5 star dish 

The Prawns on the Drunken Noodles 
- This one was good, but the drunken noodles could have used more flavoring. The shrimp was well seasoned even without mixing it in with the Thai herb\/veggie slaw. 4 star dish 

Crispy Duck Panang 
- This was the favorite of the table. The Panang sauce was delicious and the crispy duck was even better. I could have licked every last drop off of the plate. 5 star dish 

Sea Bass on Papaya Salad 
- This was a great dish to balance out the vibrant and spicy traditional Thai flavors along with the richness from the curry dish with its delicate papaya salad that had thinly sliced apples and papaya mixed in with grapes and topped with a wonderful portion of Sea Bass. 4.5 Stars

Clean up (aka Dessert) 

The combo platter 
(They were out of mangos since they said it was out of season) 
Sticky rice topped with Coconut Ice Cream 
-This was my favorite on the platter! 
Fried Bananas 
-Another Good one 
Thai Custard

I lived in Thailand for about 7 months including Chiang Mai (where I found out the owner is from) for 3. I've never tasted Thai food in America that comes close to the street food out there, until I tried Lotus of Siam. 

We got the Khao Soi, Tom Yum Gai, Pad Thai, and Panang Curry. Everything was perfect. It's as authentic as it gets, which I can see turning off some people who are used to Americanized Thai food, but everyone in our group loved it. The soup was the perfect balance of sour and spicy. Khao Soi is one of my favorite foods and I don't remember the last time I saw it on a menu - Lotus of Siam did it perfectly. The Pad Thai and Curry were great too.

Prices were reasonable for the quality and they had a surprisingly good beer selection (at a great price for craft beers). Our waitress and the rest of the staff were very friendly. It was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a while. If I lived in Vegas I'd eat here multiple times per week. Only downside is you need a car or a long taxi ride to get there, and while the place was beautifully decorated, the boxes of wine stored behind the glass didn't look great in an otherwise impressive display. That is a very minor issue that I probably only notice because I work in the industry. There seem to be a lot of Thai places in Vegas but this should definitely be the one to try.",0,0,0

I've been lucky enough to try a variety of different dishes.  No matter what you order, it will be delicious.  I can guarantee that.  There are so many tasty dishes here I can't begin to name them all, but In my opinion, there are 2 must try items:

Garlic Prawns - The prawns are deep fried with their shells.  The prawn shells are reminiscent of shrimp chips.  The prawns were cooked perfectly.  The garlic sauce that the prawns are prepared in is so delicious!!  Umami goodness.  

Crispy Duck Panang - I can't say enough about this dish.  It is super good!  The duck is perfectly crispy and provides a nice contrast in texture to the panang curry which you'll undoubtedly pour over your rice.  You'll have dreams about this after you eat it.  It is just that delicious!!

The only negative is that, compared to a lot of other good Thai restaurants around town, this place is about twice as expensive.  If you don't mind paying more for arguably the best Thai food in America, then this place is for you.  As great as the food was, I'd say that the portions were a bit small for the price you paid.

I HEART Lotus of Siam and you should too! Please don't write me a long and nasty e-mail if you don't and you got turned away at the door because you didn't make a reservation....dummy!

Vegas, but I think thats part of the attraction. 

The food is truly gourment and the service is quick, not the warmest, but with food this good I'd suffer through an open-hand slap to the face for some more Tom Kah soup. Fresh & Spicy, like Padma on Top Chef!

But we're in Vegas for her soon-to-be husband's bachelor party, so she's not my sister-in-law yet. Think that's confusing? Ask yourself why the best Thai food in Las Vegas is in a Korean strip mall?

So I'm meeting my brother's future in-laws for the first time. There's about a dozen of them, and we're at Lotus of Siam. Somehow we got reservations for Easter dinner, because if we didn't have reservations, we'd still be waiting outside for a table.

I'm not the most adventurous eater. I'm a fan of Thai food, but I'm fine with the dishes I know and love. Lotus of Siam has a lot of northern Thai dishes that aren't served at most Thai restaurants, and a lot of seafood dishes. I wanted some chicken with basil and a green curry. Both were very good. Neither changed my worldview. Future sister-in-law couldn't remember what Thai dishes she liked. Her future husband remembered and ordered for her. That's why they're married now.

So if all you know about Trinidad is that Obama just visited there, you might not know that Trinis love spicy food. S-i-l's father makes his own hot sauce every two weeks because he uses so much of it. He loved the food here. S-i-l's cousin couldn't stand the spice in his cup of soup. This is why when the server asks you how spicy you want your food, you have to pay attention and not try to impress anyone. Our server (who may very well have been the owner) tried very hard to please a table full of people most of whom had never eaten Thai food before. She largely succeeded.

So my recommendation would be to come to Lotus of Siam if you like Thai food, if you're interested in dishes that you can't get in most other restaurants, or if you like really spicy food. If you're a Thai fan, order one thing you would normally get, and then branch out to one thing on the menu that sounds good but you've never tried. If you throw in some appetizers, you'll certainly not go home hungry. I was stuffed, and wished I had ordered something besides my usuals.

We ordered:

Pad Thai: our favorite noodle dish that we always order.  The amount in the plate is fairly small compared to all the pad thai's we've had so I was disappointed.  The sauce and noodle ratio was off because there was too much sauce.  Despite this, we liked the pad Thai.

Shrimp Fried Rice: again, very small amount. We had to order two more sides of white rice (there was only two of us).

Pad Prik King: it was spicy and that was about it. I honestly don't remember the taste because it didn't make an impact on my taste buds.  There was nothing remarkable about this dish.  Won't be ordering this again.

Yellow Curry:  I LOVE YELLOW CURRY.  But this was probably the worst yellow curry I've ever tasted.  Not because it was disgusting, but because the chicken had no taste.  The soup part of the curry was good but once I bit into the chicken, there was no taste.  Absolutely disappointing.

Be adventures the menu is big with things that could sound scary to some but trust in your waiter (like I did) and you won't be disappointed.

My waiter recommend the three following dishes 

Nam Prik Ong - a dish made with a blend of spices, herbs and ground pork you can adjust the heat to your liking. Out of the three it was my least favorite because it was weird to eat without some sort of lettuce leaf to but it in. Still very good and I can see why it's one of Ming Tsai's favorite things to eat. 

The Nam Kao Tod- a crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausage, cilantro, green onions, ground dry chilies  ginger peanuts and lime juice was my favorite dish of the night. I'd never had anything like it before and all the components come together perfectly in every bite. Tip: Watch out of the dry peppers ;-)  

For my main dish the waiter recommend the Khao Soi a Burmese egg noddles coconut curry dish that was absolutely perfect. Creamy but not buttery, spicy but not overriding. Add the red onions and lime and it will take the dish to another level.

We arrived about fifteen minutes before they opened for lunch and there was already a group of people waiting in line, and as we waited four more groups pulled up. We were seated right after they opened, and followed everyone's advice to order from the Northern specialties page - I got the Khao Soi with chicken, and he got the Northern Laab. 
The Khao Soi was amazing - nuanced layers of chile flavor and rich soup body of coconut and broth. I wish this were available from my local places, but then again, that's the whole point of Lotus of Siam - fantastically prepared dishes that we can't really get anywhere else.

My client is a very well-known food critic, and knowing how much I love Thai food, he kept telling me that I needed to go to Lotus of Siam on my next Vegas trip.  ""The absolute best Thai in America,"" he insisted.

So I trust him.  He knows his ethnic food.  And on my next trip to Vegas, I made a point of going to Lotus of Siam.  And not only was it not the best Thai food in America, it wasn't even the best Thai food in Las Vegas.  Everything I ordered was way below standard from what I've had in this country and in Thailand.  Granted, I'm vegan, so my food was sans fish sauce, but still, I've had damn good vegan Thai in New York, Chicago, LA, and Chiang Mai.  This stuff didn't even come close.  My dining partner went so far as to say his food was ""disgusting."" I wouldn't go that far, but I was really not impressed.  

We ordered appetizers, entrees, and we even ordered the famed  sticky rice with mango that several of the food critics glowed about in their articles that wallpaper the entrance (you have plenty of time to read them all while you wait for your table-- the place is packed).  Even that  wasn't good, and they didn't have to alter any of the ingredients for me to eat it.

When I came back to LA, I told my client about my experience.  He was shocked.  ""You're the only person I've ever met who didn't have a life-changing experience there,"" he mused.  

I  don't know.  Maybe it was the chef's day off.   Maybe they hate vegans.  Maybe my taste buds were off.   But last time I was in Vegas, I went to the almost-empty Thai place across the shopping center from Lotus and had a much better meal.  I guess there's just no accounting for taste.",13,7,6

What we had:
1. Meatless shrimp rolls (fried). OK, nothing to write home about.
2. Wonton Soup (cup) - very nice chicken dumplings nice light flavor. Veggies in soup were disappointing.
3. Crab Salad - crab was battered and deep fried but it was not melt in your mouth, perfectly soft yet crunchy as a good crab salad should be. The accompanying vegetables were perfect and a beautiful combination. It saved this dish.
4. Sweet and sour chicken (for my kids) - Awful. Sauce was too sweet, pineapples looked like they were canned, white meat chicken were morsels not slices. Disaster.
5. Red Tofu Curry - Flavor was again just OK, not amazing. We've had much better.
6. Fried Banana, Cocunut ice cream, sticky rice - The fried banana was like an egg roll with banana inside. Very typical but good. The coconut ice cream was a disappointment. The sticky rice tasted old and consistency was not sticky. it felt like frozen sticky rice that was thawed. Completely awful.

Door opens and we walk into a vampire underworld.  What we thought was going to be a tiny place was huge, and filled with people of all ages and ethnicities grubbing down in large groups and couples.  It was crazy.  All the locals must have agreed to place this off the beaten trail, wrap it camouflage, and make it look inhabitable so tourists would stay away.

The War Wonton Soup is the best I've ever had. My mouth just filled up with juice as I wrote that.  You don't even need soy sauce.  The garlic flavor is so damn good.

I can't recall all of the names of our plates, but we had duck, pork, pot stickers, and yellow curry chicken, all of which were killer.

They say american spice is a 5 so we tried that and it was just right.  10 is the highest, but being new to this restaurant, we didn't want to chance anything higher.  Thai places are all over the board with their spice scale, besides, they'll give you extra spice to kick it up an notch or five.

The menu is very  expansive, so there are a lot of dishes to  choose from, but it was kind of a pricey  place.  There was this curry  dish I wanted to  try  out, but it was $30 and the portions (from looking around) weren't that large. I couldn't justify spending the $30 for non seafood curry. To start we ordered potstickers and salt and pepper wings. They were just ok I guess. The wings were kind of devoid of flavor unfortunately. When I  order this at Chinese places they smack you in the face and are full of flavor, but these  were kind of bland. For dinner, I ordered chicken  massamun curry and my friend i was sharing with ordered chicken pad thai.  The curry was goog, but the thing is with all these amazing reviews  i expected more . Also every dish was a small portion. The guys in our group  were still hungry after eating their noodle dishes.  When it came time to  pay the server was no where to be found. A large party  had come in  of about 15 and he catered to them , but never came to  give us our check, I kid you not we waited like 40 minutes just to pay and leave. It was kind of ridiculous. Overall,  the food was decent, but  there are definitely way better local Thai spots out there that are reasonably priced and with  food that  is soo full of flavor, e.g. Dave Wongs Pan Asian (spring valley), Gata Thai (henderson), and Le Thai (downtown).

Also, there's a swingers club in the same strip mall....gives new meaning to strip mall. the inside decor of the restaurant leaves much to be desired as well. This is not a 'date place' in terms of dressing up.  Jeans are protocol here.

They also don't take reservations, which doesn't score any points with me.  Our waitress barely spoke English to the point where another one of the waiters had to assist with our table.  She also asked us if we liked cats????????????? Now when eating in an Asian restaurant we both thought this was extremely weird. Apparently, she had found a mother cat with babies and was trying to find them homes?????? At least that's what we hope.

Eating here is always number one on our list of restaurants when coming on our yearly Vegas trip. Yes it's in a gritty neighborhood but I applaud the restaurants efforts in keeping it real and being accessible to all types of patrons. 
     Reservations are a must so we stopped by during lunch hours on Wednesday to secure a reservation for our party of 8 for the following night. We were warned about the 5 minute rule, which is essentially if all in your party are not there within 5 minutes of reservation, your table is forfeited. 
     We arrived Thursday, we're seated promptly and after some time put in drink orders. The selection of rieslings by the bottle is extensive and a bit overwhelming. Placed our order to include the following dishes:
* Rad Na with shrimp @ $11.95. - 4.5 stars, yum gravy. 
* Braised short rib with panang @ $22.95. - 4.5 stars, tender with spot on curry.
* Chow mein with chicken. @ $ 8.95. We had 9 year olds to feed, need I say more? 3 stars, but who comes here for chow mein?
* Chicken Rama @ $21.95. - 1 star. Biggest disappointment of the night.  Got this for 2 kiddos to share and it was rather sad especially for the price. The plate consisted of about 5-6 half doll
ar sized pieces of flattened white chicken on a handful of steamed snow peas and about three asparagus. Everyone was shocked when I mentioned the price. 
* Salmon Nam Tok - @ $22.95.  2 stars. Ordered level 10, not spicy and an overly lemongrass flavor. Didn't taste well seasoned but cooked perfectly.
* Prim Nook - @ $11.95. 1.5 stars. Excited to try this, totally disappointed. This was bland, even at spice level 7 and just tasted like  can of mashed hatch chilis. 
* Pepper garlic sauce with shrimp - @ $13.95. 4.5 stars. Best dish of the night for me, I will be dreaming about that sauce until I get back to vegas. 
* Spicy catfish with basil leaves - @ $14.95. 4 stars. Catfish have a wonderful crunch and a great spicy sauce.
* Moo Yang @ 14.95. 3.5 stars. This was a nice dish and definitely a better choice for the kids than the chicken rama. The pork was tender and nicely cooked. The spicy sauce on the side, delicious. 
* Mango with sticky rice @ $8.95. 3.75 stars. Rice was warm, delicious, mango was sweet but a little bit brown around the edges. A bit expensive.
     We love trying new dishes every time we come and some are hits, some misses. Lotus excels in their sauces and curries especially and has a menu of items you can't find most places.  The portions are pretty modest. I don't have that big of an appetite and could easily eat 2 dishes myself. Also, the pricing is a bit wonky to me, some items are well priced others not so.

The overall price of the food was decent but some dishes such as the Garlic Prawns we ordered was overpriced.

-= Overall: 3.5\/5.0 =-

Overall, nothing really that special, definitely not deserving of four stars and 2000+ reviews on yelp. 

If you are ever in Los Angeles, CA, go to Pasadena and try President Thai, they have very similar food to Lotus of Siam, but the food is way better and cheaper too.

Heck I can probably name Thai 5 restaurants in Los Angeles that is better than this.",2,0,0

There is no hype - except maybe the prices are higher than one expects for a Thai restaurant, but it's seriously worth it. You don't come here to eat your usual ""pad thai"" or ""pad see ew."" If you order the usual suspects and are disappointed, then that is YOUR failure. 

This place is SUPER busy. They do take reservations, although I'm not sure how one is able to make a reservation. Arriving here a few minutes after they open, there was a huge line out the door already, and we still waited for about an hour for a table of three. It's worth the wait. Seriously. I wish there was a Lotus of Siam in the Bay Area. 

Like everyone says, get the Crispy Duck Kha Soi - don't order the ""basic"" version. If you do, you'll ask, what's the big deal. To which I will respond, you have reading comprehension - Crispy Duck. Also order the garlic crispy prawns O-M-G. I just need a bucket of those, my favorite show, and I'll be snacking them like potato chips while I veg out on my sofa. I love that they separate the meat and the shell, but still attached. And it's all a giant crunch and flavor to your face.

They have a bigVery cozy and friendly , casual\/ ambient atmosphere. It doesn't look fancy at all from the outside. Waiters and waitresses were really nice.

 They serve authentic Thai foods. I have always heard about this place and finally was able to try.  Foods are amazing and my favorite is their pad Thai and pad sea ew and their curry foods are amazing. They have so many variety of food mixed with noodles and curry. Remember it's authentic that they don't have strong flavor as Americanized Thai foods
1. Pad Thai  - 4\/5: personally noodles were over cooked and not as flavorful
2. Pad sea eww  5\/5: best dish we ordered that day. But it can be too mild. So make sure you choose yours wisely
3. Garlic prawn : 5\/5  they were very generous with size of shrimp. It was really crispy. Waiter said it was their most popular dish
4. curry: very authentic. They do good job preparing the curry

Their dessert : mango sticky rice is so good too

As a big fan of Thai food, I thought I was going to have a great meal, but.........NOT!!!!

Located in a delapitated strip mall of other restaurants  and shops, this hole in the wall I thought.......might be a surprise and thus this is why there were so many positive reviews on YELP.  However, my experience was not such.

You walk in and the entrance is small and 3 people can not stand comfortably.  It's a small area then you're at the cashier's and the front room is dated and has painted green lattice partitions.  The rugs appeared dirty and the lighting was dim.  this is the area we were seated.  There's another section to th right of this and you can tell it's a newer updated area and open and looked lighter and cleaner.  the bathrooms appear to be remodeled and was nice and clean.

I wanted to try the buffet for $8.99 that seemed reasonable, but they didn't offer any curry dishes, or popular Thai dishes.  the variety was lacking compared to when you go to an Indian buffet restaurant.  they offered only had about 8 entrees, 2 soups, 6 misc of salad, fried shrimp chips, fried banana, fried curry pouches, apple slices and orange slices and that's it.   I was disappointed and do not recommend their buffet at all.   

they had 2 types of soups, duck soup which had bits of duck and was greasy and the other was a egg flower soup and was good.   They had pad thai, but it was nothing special, the fried garlic wings was good, the other dishes were just alot of stir fry vegetables, and a chow mein style noodle dish.  a green salad with ranch dressing, I didn't understand how this is Thai....why didn't they have payaya salad.  Overall, it was more of a chinese buffet type food then all Thai food.

My partner ordered the Pad Sew flat noodle dish, but the waiter came out with another dish altogether.  A disappointment, but he liked the dish anyway.   It was a beef stir fry with cashews and a bowl of rice. 

the waiter charged us for the incorrect dish that cost more, and he wouldn't correct the bill bc he said we accepted the dish and didn't return it back to the kitchen.  He wasn't very nice about this and the mistake was most likely due to a language barrier communication.

So DO NOT go for the buffet.  Make sure you double check your order to get the right dish...best to point to the item on the menu, since English is not their first language.

Most of the dishes were about $9. to $15. per entree and that's expensive compared to the bay area, probably bc they have to ship it to LV.

I can't comment on their Thai dishes, but can say that the buffet is not worth it, and they should get rid of the buffet or expand it and keep it freshly stocked and not sitting there for so long.  No one refilled any of the pans when I was there.",0,0,0

The ingredients are fresh and appropriate to the style.  Dishes are properly prepared and done quickly given the fact that the restaurant is always crowded.

They also have a remarkable wine list for a restaurant of this genre.  There are several Grand Cru Bordeaux choices with a range of vintages as well as all the usual suspects.  But, it IS Las Vegas :D

-Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice Mixed w\/Sour Pork Sausages, Green Onions, Fresh Chilies, Ginger, Peanuts, Lime Juice, $8.95, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw#rKk64ejUni6uZqOPhsvAGw): I didn't like this version- the crispy rice wasn't very crispy, and I didn't think the flavors worked very well together. I've had a much better version from Sticky Rice in the Bay Area. Skip!
-Khao Soi Braised Short Rib (Northern Thai Egg Noodle Served in Curry Sauce, Coconut Cream w\/Braised Short Ribs Garnished w\/Sliced Ted Onions, Lime, Pickled Vegetables, $22.95, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw#LgHpnSwICwKPgyrxHLQ2NA): Pretty good, but the braised short rib was a bit overcooked, and too lean. Most of the pieces were really tender, but the dish overall was bland, although the curry was good. I probably wouldn't order this again for the price.
-Garlic Prawns (Deep Fried Prawns w\/Shells, Sautéed w\/Special Garlic Sauce, Topped w\/Ground Black Pepper, $23.95, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw#b8ru2oKjJXw4Vu5dRuLXZg): AMAZING, and a must order! The prawn shells were super crispy\/crunchy, and flavorful. The shrimp pieces were gigantic, and cooked perfectly. This dish made the dinner!
-Crispy Duck Topped w\/Fresh Homemade Chili & Thai Basil, Served on Top of Pan Fried Flat Noodles\/Drunken Noodles, $25.95, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw#Gec8FZpK3d7Z-iXQs5QLDw): Pretty good, although I didn't think the crispy duck went that well with the drunken noodles, and they give you the tiniest portion of drunken noodles ever. I did like the crispiness of the duck, and the preparation was very unique- something I've never eaten before. I would recommend trying the crispy duck for sure, but not on top of the drunken noodles. 

Service was efficient, and our food came out pretty quickly. Their dishes are definitely on the pricey side for Thai food, but the Garlic Prawns really makes up for all of their other misses. Their menu is so extensive that it's hard to narrow down your order, so I hope to be back again in the future to try out more dishes! Parking is easy in this complex since it's so large, and they help call you a cab if needed.",0,0,0

I loved the food the first time around, it's just that my friends and I have been trying to go to all the restaurants we discover on Yelp!  When I ate there last year, it was before the restaurant had been remodeled.  It was a small space for such a popular restaurant, and reservations seemed to be the way to go.  Now that should have changed with the recent remodel, which added more dining space, a bar and large wine selection.

All of the dishes I've had here have been delicious.  I could live off of the pad thai and crab fried rice.  (Funny story about the crab fried rice: during our first visit we were trying to order fried rice, but with chicken or shrimp, something that wasn't crab.  Our pushy waitress told us, ""No, you want the crab fried rice.""  After she repeatedly insisted we get that, we gave in; we were not disappointed.  We DID want the crab fried rice, we just didn't know it yet!)  I can't comment as to what other dishes I've had there, as I'm not very familiar with thai food.  The only other thai restaurants I have under my belt are Archi's Thai Kitchen and Thai Spice (where I always get the orange chicken...).

As you can probably tell by most of the reviews, the food ranges from good to outstanding.  I'll let you read everyone elses reviews since, like I said, I'm not well versed when it comes to thai.  However, the one thing I do feel I need to talk about is the service.  It is absolutely great that the dining space has been expanded, allowing more tables for guests to be seated at.  What I don't like is that the waiters\/waitresses did not appear to be assigned to a specific area or set of tables.  There were a lot of employees working during the Friday night I went there, many of whom served my table at one point or another.  I don't think we had the same server visit our table twice that night, which made it annoying when trying to flag someone down.  I can't count the number of times I saw a server with a tray of food standing around looking lost and confused, wondering which table the order belonged to.  Trying to get more water, order more dishes, order dessert, or get the check was a trial in patience.

Does the quality of the food outweigh my bad experience with the service?  Yes, it does.  But when i recommend this place to friends, the recommendation will always be accompanied by a footnote to be prepared to do a lot of sitting and waiting.",1,0,0

There were 6 of us. The 5 other people I dined with are American and i'm British. I don't know if the U.S. is lacking in good Thai restaurants but this place for me was just 'good' despite previously being told by my American friends that this place is amazing\/delicious\/fantastic...

Half of us ordered chicken pad thai and the other half of us ordered green or yellow chicken thai curry. We had soup and spring rolls for starters. The food in my opinion was tasty, but nothing that excited my taste buds. The sauce for the curry was a little watery in my opinion and the spring rolls lacked in flavour. If I could give this restaurant 3.5 out of 5 I would as i'm teetering between giving 3 or 4 stars. The service was just ok, not as attentive as they could have been but not impossibly slow. I had a lovely evening but that was mainly more due to the company than the food. I do have to say though that the portions are very generously sized and the prices are reasonable. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here next time i'm in Vegas as cab fare is about $25 each way, not too bad if there's a group of you but if there's only you and one other then maybe not. I would only return IF I or someone I was travelling with had a strong craving for Thai food when in Vegas but other than that, I live in the North of England and there are tonnes of Thai restaurants in our city centres of Leeds & Manchester of which i've ate at many of them and have had much better Thai food back home in the U.K. This isn't the worst Thai restaurant i've been to, it's just okay\/nice\/pleasant.. nothing outstanding.",0,0,0

I'd recommend calling beforehand and making reservations as the waiting time was a bit long -- 40 minutes for 3 people -- even on a Monday night.

The inside of the restaurant isn't glitzy either. Except for the glass storage room where they store their wines, the inside definitely needs some modernizing. But, it's clean and roomy.

My friends ordered the Yellow Curry and Pad Thai, while I ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken. The food were served simply: no fancy garnishes or pretentiousness. It was like being served a home-cooked meal. My food was flavorful and tangy. I loved the abundance of vegetables, and the fresh cucumbers were an interesting contrast to the sweet pineapple chunks. My friends devoured their food, and vowed to come more often, especially since they actually live in Vegas.

The service was great. Our server was attentive and friendly. He refilled our rice bowls and drinks when needed. He even boxed up my leftovers for me, and gave me some extra rice to go with it. Overall, I really liked this restaurant, and I understand why it was rated so highly. If I'm ever in Vegas again, I'll definitely be eating here.",1,0,0

For me, I love Komol in the same business plaza, Commercial Center. I finally decided to check it out. We unwittingly showed up like 15 minutes early. We waited in the car and there was a line forming outside the restaurant. I thought, Holy crap, maybe this is the Holy Grail of Thai food. In Vegas. 

They had a buffet going on for lunch, but I wanted my first LOS experience to be a pure one. I copped a look at the buffet and it didn't look that great anyway. It looked kinda Chinese. 

The menu was large and had clear descriptions (in FOBese) of the items. And although you can make a lot of Thai meat dishes vegetarian, they did not have a section of the menu specifically for vegetarians. Like Komol. 

To start, we ordered the famous tom kah kai soup. It was really good, but really fattening, I think all it is is coconut milk, chili oil, and maybe chicken broth with bland chunks of chicken, straw mushroom, and cilantro (?). But I could sit there and drink the broth all day. You can get a cup, bowl, or hot pot. I think my cup was $4. 

We tried the panang just because I needed to compare and contrast to neighboring Komol's killer panang. I always get the tofu panang because I'm a part-time vegetarian (fair weather, really). LOS's panang was just like red curry. I don't know what's closer to original recipe, LOS or Komol's, but Komol's just tastes better. Its really robust and hearty. LOS's was really smooth and wussy. It just slipped off the tofu. 

We also got the steamed mussels. They steam it in fish sauce and basil leaves and give you a green chili lime dipping sauce which has even more fish sauce and is deceptively spicy. Just because it ain't red, don't mean it ain't spicy. It was really fishy. And the sauce was way too hot for me consume.

We got the sweet sticky rice dessert, which I think is normally supposed to come with mango, but they were 86 for the day. The dessert was good. Standard stuff. But the coconut milk was really thick and they garnished the rice with a crispy topping, like baked rice or something. That gave the texture a nice variation. 

Sorry, I don't have a cost breakdown of all the items, but for the two of us three entrees, two sticky rice, two drinks, and dessert, and some leftovers, our total bill was $53 before tip. Not bad, I guess. Holy crap, we did eat a lot ... Our entrees ranged $8-15. 

The restaurant has a homey kind of ambiance. The ceiling is low and the walls are decorated with Thai things and pictures of the proprietress (I'm guessing) and guests. I like the way the restaurant is sectioned. It keeps the noise down. 

By the time we were done with our meal, the restaurant was packed and the buffet was wrecked. 

I appreciate this place. Their menu is impressive, the food and service was good, it was clean, and prices were decent, but I'd pick Komol over Lotus of Siam. Komol hits the same points, but their panang is better. Haha. 

I think I'll come to like it more when I find the super great items on the menu.

We had heard rave reviews and knew celebrities even frequented the place. When we first pulled up, we were a little surprised by the restaurant's appearance. It's definitely not fancy, and isn't in the nicest of neighborhoods. Nonetheless, we had heard such great things about the food so we were excited to give it a try. When we walked in, the inside was pretty cute. We had quite a long wait (as other reviewers said, reservations are a good idea). We thought we'd just go to the bar and have a drink while we waited. The bartender was AMAZING. I'm very picky about wines, and she let me taste a couple before ordering the one I wanted. When a table finally opened up, the dinner service was absolutely fantastic as well. Everyone was so friendly and attentive! As for the food, it was by far some of the best Thai I have ever had. I had the calamari garlic. I love calamari, but sometimes when I order it in restaurants it's really tough and chewy. The calamari here was SO tender. The sauce was spicy and fragrant: lots of garlic and cilantro. I just wish I could have it more often! Especially for the quality of the food, the prices are incredibly reasonable.

My friend and I walked nearly 2 miles to eat here, then had to wait 45 minutes for a table (I would recommend making a reservation), and both the journey and the wait were well worth it.

My friend is a vegetarian, so she ordered the Pad Thai with a few special requests (she wanted it minus sprouts, loaded up with more veggies, peanut sauce on the side, etc.). Our server was very accommodating and only charged my friend an extra $2 for all the changes she wanted.

I ordered the Pad Prik King with chicken and asked for it to be ""pretty spicy"". It was the perfect level of spice (but hey, I like it hot!).

My friend ordered a glass of wine and I had a Guinness since the alcohol prices were very reasonable. Even with the drinks, our entire bill only came to $40. The glass of wine was the most expensive item.

I would definitely make the trek to Lotus of Siam again the next time I'm in Vegas!",5,0,4

It was fried with mild seasoning but tender as well.  The noodles were more saucy than I've had at other Thai restaurants but still wonderful.  The garlic scallops were delicious as well.  You could really taste the garlic and cilantro. The scallops were seared perfectly.  Great crust and super tender inside.  The star of the meal was the garlic prawns- OMG.  So amazing!!   Crispy and perfectly seasoned!!!  It was fun to see Saipin walking around and all her pictures with celebrities on the wall.  She has one with Elvis!!",0,0,0

So when I think of Thai food, I think of flavorful food.  However, this place didn't tickle my taste bud or even satisfy my Thai food craving.

Found this place on yelp and wanted to try this place since it has 4-stars and over 1200 reviews.  I thought to myself...wow this place must be authentic and good.

Got there at about 5:15pm (they open at 5:30pm for dinner) after reading some reviews saying that this place has a long wait and I didn't want to wait in line.  There were a few people waiting in line already and more people came after we got in line.  

The place is fairly big and has a pretty impressive wine cellar... but sorry to say that was the one thing that was impressive.  They also had a big staff if waiters\/waitress waiting to serve you.  We got seated and the place filled up pretty quickly.

So when you walk into an Asian restaurant and see that 90% of the customers there were American...what would you think?  Not trying to offend anyone, but I think this place is catered to the American's taste buds.

Food we tried:

Thai Ice Tea - Pretty good smooth tea but it was a little on the sweeter side.  

Spicy Chicken Wings - I think this should be called sweet and sour chicken wings instead.  This dish was okay and was very saucy and sweet...not spicy at all (it looks like it has sweet and sour sauce on it).

Nau Dad Deaw (Beef Jerky) - As you can say... beef jerky...its pretty tough and not as flavorful...

Som Thum (Papaya Salad) - Very toned down.  I mean very very toned down and bland.  They papaya was coarsely cut and is not the thinly strands as you see in other papaya salad.  Not authentic at all.

Crispy Duck Panang Curry - This is probably the best food dish of all that we ordered.  Still not as tasty as the ones I've had back in NorCal. Again, this dish is also tone down.

Sea Bass Drunken Noodles - How can you go wrong with a noodle dish??? but somehow they manage to make it bad.  The taste of it was bland and the noodles were hard.  I guess the noodles are probably old.  The sea bass was deep fried and was decent in taste. 

Mango Sticky Rice Dessert - I would say this is the best tasting dish of our meal.  Come on.. how can you go wrong with mango and sticky rice right.  I love mangoes so this dish is definitely yummy to me.

I would have to say we did over order for the two of us, but because of the reviews I read, I wanted to try different items.  The portions are smaller than other Thai restaurants and the prices are a bit marked up.  With all the dishes we ordered, we thought our check will come out to about $70, but I was wrong...our bill was almost $100.  We could of gone somewhere else and have better tasting food with the amount we paid.  Pretty disappointed in this place.",5,1,2

Crispy duck paneng (favorite, eat it while its hot)

Portions here is not the best for the price. But each dish was tasty. Not to sound snobby or anything, but us angelinos are really spoiled by the diversity of our city.

I especially love their juicy satay skewers & green curry!

The menu is so large that you can come back again, and again, and again and still order a completely new spread each time.   There's even a Northern Thai section with dishes that have a Burmese influence.  If you're staying on the strip, I would make the extra trek out here.

When you think you want a spice level of 8 and the wait staff recommend something lower....you should trust them.  We started our foray into their legendary cuisine with the glass noodles and were pre-warned about the heat level.  Those were some of the hottest noodles I've ever had.  It was definitely an experience everyone should have.  The rest of our dishes, which were also very hot compared to what I normally eat, were mild in comparison and at the end of the meal I craved the masochistic spice level of the noodles.

Every dish was excellent and the 40 minute wait was worth it.

The strip mall location is very deceiving and before you walk in you expect some sort of ""sleazy massage parlor full of henchmen waiting to kill you"" environment.  But once you walk in the door you are very nicely surprised at the decor, the lively ambiance, and the large array of wines.

I've gotten take out before but have never eaten at this mecca for all things Thai food. First of all I must say the service is excellent! You can tell the servers make money here and they are all professionals. Secondly the food is amazing, we already know this. We didn't come not knowing the depth of amazingness, we came to sit back and let Lotus of Siam feed us till we couldn't eat anymore. 

We started with the ubiquitous chicken satay, which was by far the most authentic and best chicken satay I've ever had. The chicken almost seemed charcoal grilled and the peanut sauce was fresh and spot on. 

Secondly we had the Som Tum papaya salad which was excellent! Hotter than napalm but excellent nonetheless. I should of ordered sticky rice with it, my bad. 

Note: I ordered everything level 5 spicy out of 10 because my wife likes hot but not super hot. I must say the 5 here is an easy 7 or 8 at an American Thai restaurant. The papaya salad was easily an 8, I loved it but it was too hot for the wifey.

Next we had the Nam Tok (like a larb but instead of ground meet its with grilled beef). The Nam Tok's flavor was spot on. That lime juice, roasted rice powder, mint, cilantro, onion, shallot, and chili flavor I love. The only downside was the meat was very fatty which i didn't love.

Lastly we had the Chicken fried rice with Spicy Basil sauce. Best fried rice I've ever had. Hot as heck but excellent flavor and quality cuts of chicken.

First off my preference at Thai restaurants is for a slightly thick sweet curry sauce. For the most part, I have based my rating on the curry dish. With that being said, on to my thoughts on Lotus of Siam. 
 
We started of with an appetizer of Shrimp wrapped with bacon wrapped in a won-ton wrap. This one has a nice bacon flavor, which doesn't always happen with bacon appetizers. I imagine if you ordered this to go the wrapper would suck but seeing as we ate it at the restaurant it was quite good as the wrapper was nice and crisp. It came with a light sweet and sour sauce which complemented it well. All in all a worthwhile appetizer. 4.5 out of 5

We ordered Yellow curry with pork (#4 on the spicy level). It was good but not great, like I said earlier I like my curry sauce a little bit thick and I like it to have a little more sweetness than this one had. Would I order it again? Probably, but that has more to do with really liking curry than really liking this dish. 3 out of 5

We also ordered the Crab fried rice. How do you describe good fried rice. I don't know but this is it. Slightly sweet, just the right amount of oil, this was an excellent dish. 5 out 5

Service - The service was ok, a little long waiting for someone to come with our check but U expect things like this with a busy restaurant that has reasonable prices. 3.5 out 5

It was strange - the restaurant is on the street, and looks almost as if it's closed and abandoned.  If you drive around to the back, you find the strip mall with the actual front of the restaurant.  The mall is strange - there are a few other restaurants and an eclectic bunch of stores and other things.

Don't let the looks of the mall get to you - the restaurant is lovely inside.  Service was great from the moment we were seated.  

We decided to get what everyone else suggested - the Garlic Prawns.  We started with the Chicken Satay, which was one of the best versions I can remember having.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the satay sauce was perfect.

We also ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp.  Once again, it was one of the best versions I can remember having.  

The Garlic Prawns came to the table, and we were a bit surprised.  We knew it was supposed to be crispy, but we didn't realize the shrimp shells were fried separately.  It was a strange-looking dish, but on our first bite of the crispy shells, we understood.  It's like shrimp chips - not those pastel colored things they call ""shrimp chips"" - but actually potato-chip-like chips made from deep frying the shrimp shells.   It was like nothing I have ever had before - and it was amazing.  The shrimp themselves were wonderfully done as well, but I am not really sure which part of the dish I enjoyed more - the shrimp or the shells.

I guess we will just have to go back again sometime to figure it out :)

But step inside, and your anxiety is replaced with welcome  relief. The floor-to-ceiling wine bottles behind the glass wall near the door assures you that not only are you safe, but that you'll probably leave with a full stomach and maybe a buzz. The decor is plain but comfortable.
The food, however, is hit or miss. We ordered the chicken satay and agreed that it was the worst both of us have ever had (& coming from different cities, we've sampled our share of Thai food). The chicken was a semi-soft, almost artificial consistency and the seasoned exterior was somewhat slimy.  The flavor itself was average. Insert *blechh!*-faced emoji here...
Our entrees were better, moving up to a solid, ""acceptable"". We ate them, but have had better. Mine was pad prik khing and hers was a curry shrimp dish.
Lastly, the dessert, coconut ice cream with sticky rice, was presented plainly (see pic), but really very good. As full as I was at that time, I didn't leave a grain of rice in that sadly empty little bowl.

For lunch, they have a mini buffet that has a decent selection (including fruit).  In no particular order, here's what we ordered (I apologize in advance for not having the proper names of things, but I just can't remember):

drunken noodles with fish (entree) - YUM.  The noodles were a bit greasy, but the fish was perfectly fried - lightly crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside.  The flavors were also incredible, lots of basil goodness, for those who love that.

raw shrimp (appetizer) - yes, the shrimp was raw, but if you can get past that, this dish is definitely worth trying.  it comes with this really tasty dipping sauce that's spicy, but not in the ah ah flaming hot way, but the savory rich way.  You like spicy?  You like sour?  Try this dish!

raw steak tartare (appetizer) - the flavors in here were amazing.  the closest I can come to describing it is that it's a bit like the cold chinese beef five spice dish, with more thai flavors mixed in.  I know that that description is pretty much no description at all, but if you like spicy and you like meat, you should definitely give this a try.

scallops with mint chili sauce - oh god so good.  the scallops were cooked to perfection, and that sauce...well, I could drink it as soup with a side of rice.  It's not overwhelmingly minty, and also has a nice kick of cilantro to it.

tom yum soup - really really sour, with a hint of spice - we got the ""for two"" bowl (medium size), and shared with four people, which was really the perfect amount for an appetizer.  There were lots of big juicy prawns inside, and also some mushrooms and chili oil.

beef salad - our waiter recommended this to us, as one of the most popular dishes, and I can certainly see why.  This was probably my favorite (though ironically, I can't remember the thai name for it).  The beef was really tender (I think they marinated it or something beforehand), and it was served over a bed of lettuce with onions, lime juice, and a hint of ginger.  The dish was pretty saucy, though, so you'll definitely need some rice to eat with it.

This place is pretty pricey, especially anything with seafood in it, so be prepared to spend some dough.  My experience with Thai food up until this place was pretty much pad thai and basil chicken, so this place really opened up my eyes to just how incredible Thai food can be.  And if you're like me, and don't really like the coconut-y, peanut-y side of Thai food, rest assured that this place has plenty of other spicy\/sour items for you to try if that's what floats your boat.

Garlic prawns (~28): Another dish that is insanely popular here...and for a reason! This was my favorite dish of the night. The prawns are fried with a crunchy outer exterior and seasoned with perfectly. The meat was juicy! They also fried up the shells of the prawns making for even more crunchy goodness!

Pad See Ew (~11): We got this with chicken. The noodles were soft, but overall nothing that mind-blowing.

Crab fried rice (~15): The fried rice was good but they gave too little crab. Overall too small of a dish.

The tom kha soup was creamy, coconut, mushroom, protein, and citrus. A nice mix match of sweetness, savory, and spices. Unexpectedly overwhelming delicious soup. 

Pad Thai with chicken was one of the best I have tried. Nice balance of noodles, eggs, sprouts, chicken in sauce. 

Pork belly with peppers and Chinese. greens. Not fatty pork belly mixed with the others in a light style sauce crisp Chinese greens. Good dish. Not my personal like for pork belly but not as fatty as I like. 

Khao Soi -Short Rib was one of two khao dishes. The one we ordered was one of the specialty dishes. The tender seasoned short rib was nestled within crispy noodles, green, and some of the best curry sauce. Not overly hot. The sauce I could just drink. It was that delicious. 

Duck paanang Curry. Oh my. Oh my. It's a flavor explosion. Freaking awesome curry sauce. Spices. Lean tender duck. Lots of duck. This curry was also one of the best.

Seafood drunken noodle : Not happy with this one. It was soggy, soupy, and clumpy. I asked for Thai spicy, it wasn't spicy enough. More like mild medium Thai spicy. 2prawns, 2 green mussels, 1 scallop and 2 big imitation crab meat. 

White rice.

Togo : pineapple fried rice. When we almost finished our dinner, we ordered a pineapple fried rice for to go. We waited for a long time for this. Almost an hour. 

My reservation time was 8:30p.m. 
They were 3-4 parties waiting for tables when my party got in around 8:15p.m By the time we ordered this rice  it was around 8:50p.m. we got the rice approximately 9:40 p.m. 

We asked so many waiters to check the pineapple fried rice. All say yes, went in to check but none come back to tell us. Trying not to spoiled the vacation, we were still in a happy mood. I started to get up and actually read articles on the walls. Then we went back to our hotel with the pineapple fried rice.

Icing on the cake. The fried rice was tasteless. Hold on. Let me correct myself. The pineapple fried rice was very fragrant, when I open the box, it smells so good, but, it has no taste, not salty not sweet And..... the chicken was undercooked. What? How?  I waited for so long for this fried rice. supposed to be perfect. -_-.

I'll post the pictures later. 

I should have known. I'm from L.A. we have wonderful authentic Thai food to choose from. What I want to say is, good experience but once is enough.",2,0,0

I'm a Thai fanatic. Sometimes I'll eat it 25 times in a month. I know where all the good places are, I try most Thai restaurants in most cities I live in. So when I heard that this place was supposed to be ""the best Thai food in America,"" I put a lot of effort into checking it out. Walked 45 minutes or so, actually (with all of the awful Vegas crosswalks).

The place is in a dumpy strip mall past a gay sex club and an Indian restaurant. Boo-yah. Servers weren't particularly friendly, and while the place was huge, it wasn't particularly... aesthetically pleasing. A bit old-school.

We ordered from a rather stoic waitress, and our food arrived quickly. It was really good. Delicious, even. But at the end of the day, it didn't unseat MY nomination for the best Thai food in America... Spicy BBQ Restaurant in Hollywood, CA. And there, the server (Kay) is an absolute sweetheart.

Since we didn't make a reservation for our party of 8, the boy and I made a mad dash to the restaurant early to see if we could still get a table. They just opened for dinner (at 5pm), but the restaurant was pretty much filled already. Luckily, they had a large table open at the moment, so they let the two of us sit down first. (Some restaurants won't even seat you unless your whole party is there, so that was pretty nice!)

We sat there waiting for our friends for 10-15 minutes (which we felt really bad about), but they didn't seem annoyed at all, whew! After flipping through the menu, we ordered ten dishes. 

- Stuffed Chicken Wings: sliced chicken wings - crispy, flavorful, and served with sweet and sour sauce
- Nam Kao Tod: crispy rice - very interesting, you have to try if you've never had crispy rice before!
- Nam-Prik-Hed: spicy mushroom dip - spicy! but meh, at least the veggies that comes with it was kind of cleansing to the palette
- Sai Oua: northern style sausage - were alright
- Garlic Prawns: BOMB DOT COM. THIS IS A NECESSITY!
- Yellow Curry and Red Curry: very flavorful
- Drunken Noodle Seafood: pretty delicious!
- Pad Se-Ew: typical
- Crispy Duck: cooked perfectly

Their Thai Iced Tea was pretty refreshing! And because some of the food came out slower, they offered us a free Thai Iced Tea.

We got two orders of mango sticky rice and one order of fried bananas. Both were delicious! (I've had better sticky rice though..) 

They also have a HUGE selection of wine! So if you're a wine lover, you're in for a treat!

Lotus of Siam has long held the reputation of being one of the top Thai restaurants in the country and I finally got to experience the bombness of this place!  Perhaps, it's because of the location.  It is in a very seedy party of town that LOOKS seedy during the day and even seedier at night.  Great food found in a dumpy strip mall?  Perfect.

We went during lunch time and did not go with the lunch buffet.  As advised by on of our Lotus of Siam experience friends, we chose to order from the menu instead and it was the way to go!  I think everything we chose was deep fried in some form or another, which lead to a cholesterol fest of food.  I'm getting older, so that stuff don't phase me (yet).

- Our introduction was Garlic Prawns.  Crispy + salty = good.

- Next came the Chilean Seabass and Drunken Noodles and Crispy Duck Panang.  Flavors were on the saltier side, but again, I am a sucker for CRISPY!!

- My most favorite dish was Nam Koi Tod (minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice).  I've never had this dish before anywhere, so it was a fun new dish.  Crispy crunchy rice with the fragrant flavors of all the fixings left a party in my mouth!

My main focus at Lotus is their Northern Thai specialties. Besides these dishes, there are a lot of other Thai specialties that you don't typically find at other Thai restaurants in the valley. 

Nam Kao Tod ($8.95): Crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chili, ginger, peanuts and lime juice. Tasty salad mixture with great texture from the crispy rice. Love all the herbs and flavors.

Sai Oua ($11.95): Northern Thai-style spicy pork sausage. Served with ginger, red onion, chilies, and Napa cabbage. One of my all-time favorite sausages. I love the lemongrass especially. The sausage is great with all the fixings, too.

Nam Prik Ong ($11.95): Northern Thai red chili dip composed of ground pork, tomato, and spices; served with assorted vegetables and fried pork rinds. This dip will remind you of a meat sauce (you could totally create a pasta with it). It has a good depth of flavor and it's not heavy.

Thum Ka Noon ($10.95): Pounded and shredded young jackfruit salad with ground pork, tomato, and northern Thai spices and seasoning. Another delicious Northern Thai specialty. I enjoyed the flavors of this salad more than the Nam Kao Tod and Nam Prik Ong. Goes well with rice.

Crispy Duck Panang ($27.95): Crispy duck topped with Thai style red cream curry sauce with cognac. The duck is juicy and the skin is fantastically crispy. The panang is really great, too and definitely good with any choice of meat, but the crispy duck is the way to go!

Everything is delicious and takes me back to my vacation in Chiang Mai. I'm definitely back for more specialties!",10,6,8

The place decor and the place itself is nothing special. Not the fanciest, but not the ugliest Thai place I've been to.

The food, however, is out of this world! I'm not too picky about Thai food, but I can tell Lotus of Siam knows their Thai flavors very very very well. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. My favorite dish was nam kao tod. I only ordered it because of the Yelp reviews, and I'm so glad I did!!!!! The flavors are so indescribable... I just wish the portion was bigger because the 4 of us was fighting over it, haha! The rice is crispy with a nice crunch to it and it has a sour lime taste, combined with small pieces of sausages or whatever the heck it was that made this dish so amazing.

We ordered a bunch of other things... tom yum hot pot, pad thai, soft shell crabs pad kee mao, some curry dish, fried rice, and I forgot the rest. Everything was on point and delicious! Don't be intimidated by the extensive menu... just experiment and pick something fun, I guarantee everything on the menu will satisfy!",1,0,1

We had a bunch of classics and they were all excellent. The tom ka gai was tangy and spicy and flavorful. My mouth is literally watering just thinking about it. We also had the beef salad which was great. The beef was grilled and came in thicker slices than I'm used to and you could really enjoy the grilled flavor of the beef. We also had the short ribs in Penang curry-awesome. Beef was so tender and falling apart which is just how I like my slow cooked shot ribs. Lots of delicious curry. And we had sea bass on drunken noodles. The noodles were smokey and flavorful on their own. Pad Thai was delicious but you know, pad Thai can only ever be so good  

I was not expecting much from the location, but it is surprisingly large and bustling inside with a friendly staff and comfortable surroundings. Not very fancy but this is not a dive or hole in the wall.

The group of us ordered the Tom Kha Gai soup and Tod Mun fish cakes to start. I've had the fish cakes here before and they are, as always, soft and flavourful, especially with the accompanying diced cucumbers and sweet\/sour sauce. The soup had chicken that was a little chewy, but was nicely spicy and piping hot-- though to be honest, I'm not sure why we ordered soup in 105 degree weather!
On to the entrées, which were a mixed bag for me. I enjoyed the nuttiness and creaminess of the Penang Curry (paired nicely with tofu) as well as the Pad See Ew noodles. The sweetness from the palm sugar was noticeable in those dishes but were not overpowering. However, the Mee Krob crispy noodles tasted oddly chemical-like to me. I just could not eat them, and I think it was just the combination of spices and vegetables that created a strange odour and taste. The northern curry with (sparse) catfish was a little on the bland side for me and not quite what I'd expected. It was almost like soup; sauce was thin and did not hold up to the rice I drizzled it over.

I didnt care because i wanted thai and didnt feel like waiting for another cab and taking it back to the strip. So i sat at the bar and enjoyed a singah until my name was called.
I like to judge Thai restaurants solely based off the peanut sauce when I order chicken satay. If I want to take a whole jar home, sit in front of the tv with a spoon and eat it, I know their food will be just as good. This place isn't an exception. It was right up on my ""most favorite peanut sauce"" list (yes, I have a list of good peanut sauce restaurants, don't judge me). 
I ordered the chicken stay for an appetizer and na num tok or something...it was beef and beef makes me happy when I eat it. 
I wasn't expecting a crap load of thai basil and cilantro (which I don't care for) being on the plate when presented.  I managed to eat it and still enjoyed it with the exception of the couple cilantro bites I got. Probably wont order it again, but I will deffinetly be back here my next vegas trip.

Anyhoot, we arrive at a non-descript strip mall in the middle of no where.  I didn't even notice the restaurant and asked the cab driver 'Are you sure this is it?' because he dropped us off at an indian restaurant next door to lotus of siam.  we finally walk in and instantly surprised by the size and decor of the place.  it's got a nice wine section and the restaurant was packed for a Sat night.  Reservations only so call ahead to be sure they have space.

On to the food.  Literally the best mussaman curry I've ever had.  I'd pay that same 9 or 10 dollars just for the curry sauce with a bowl of white rice.  just enough heat on the curry and the beef was super tender.  We also the old stand by pad see ew, except this was the best I've ever had.  noodles still had nice life to them (weren't sauteed until it was mush) and the greens were fresh and crunchy with a tart bite.  Loved those two plates.  We had also had the garlic shrimp and beef salad.  both were very good, but not outstanding like the pad see ew and mussaman curry.  The weakest dish was the appetizer.  It was the nam kao tod (the crispy rice appetizer everyone raves about).  It was ok\/good for me.  Has a strong salty\/sour flavor component with the crispy rice texture.  Good when eaten with the garnish, but still overpowering with the salt.

Overall, awesome thai food.  Take a couple of green chips from the blackjack table and stash them away in your pocket.  might be fun gambling it on cards, but for that same amount of cash, you're guaranteed some awesome thai food off the strip and that's a win in of itself.",1,2,1

On Saturday, Devin and I took my parents to Lotus of Siam. We have been in a bowling league with most of the waitstaff for about a year now, and we've been meaning to go there. When an article about this year's James Beard award floated my way, I noticed that among the nominees, which included the Chefs from Joel Robuchon and Rick Moonen, was the Chef from Lotus of Siam. That sealed the deal; we had to go there as soon as possible.

The restaurant is easy to drive right by; there's a sign on what looks like a warehouse on Sahara, just east of the Strip. Never fear; the entrance is on the other side, and the ambiance is nice. We didn't have reservations but got in at 7PM on a Saturday night with no problem. The crowd started showing up at 8, so I would recommend reservations for a later meal.

The wine list is huge, but since I didn't know what I was planning on eating, I just ordered a beer. They have both Singha and Chang beer from Thailand. The menu is similarly huge, probably ten pages of dishes conveniently numbered so you don't have to fumble through pronunciations if you aren't used to ordering Thai food.

I started with the Tom Yum Kai soup, which is my favorite thing to eat at Thai restaurants. I asked for it hot-spicy. Heed my warning: If you're at all nervous about your heat threshold, go for medium-spicy. I love really spicy food, so I thought the soup was great. I also ordered the Spicy Catfish. It was thin filets of fish battered and fried, with a delicious sauce, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I even had leftovers since we ordered so many other dishes.

Other things ordered were the stuffed chicken wings appetizer, the chicken satay with peanut sauce, and the jackfruit dish, which was, I believe, mashed jackfruit, pork, and herbs in a spicy sauce. That one was delicious, as was everything else. My Dad ordered a salmon dish, which he said was really great. I believe it because there was absolutely nothing left on his plate when he was done, and the man knows his salmon. Devin ordered the Pad Thai, which was probably the best I've ever had. The noodles were very thin compared to the rice stick noodles that are usually used for Pad Thai, and it was also hot enough to excite my spice-seeking palate, even when ordered at medium-spicy.

Then came dessert. One of my favorite things in the world is sticky rice with mango, so we ordered that. They put a dessert platter together for us that included the rice, mango, some coconut ice cream, and some fried bananas. They do their fried bananas in phyllo dough, which is something I'd never seen before, and I loved it. Do not skip dessert, even if it means taking some of your main course home like we did.

The service was excellent, and I'm not just saying that because our waiter was one of our bowling buddies. They were attentive, and when we asked to take about five different things home, they took the plates away and boxed everything separately for us. Most impressive and refreshing: My Dad asked the waiter what he should order from two choices, and the waiter honestly told him which dish he liked better (the salmon), instead of pulling the, ""Well, they're both good..."" junk that waitstaff usually gives you when you ask for a recommendation.

I thought the price was incredible considering how much food we had. Including food, drinks, dessert, and two hours of just fun eating, we walked out at less than $40 a person. Parking is convenient, abundant, and free.

I can see why people call this place the best Thai restaurant in America. It's the best one that I've been to. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this restaurant.",2,1,2

Panang chicken and shrimp was very good. The shrimp, unlike a lot of places were big and tender. 

They do have a lunch buffet with a decent offering, and I don't know if they change it up daily or not, but it didn't tickle my fancy.   Our group of ~16 was almost evenly divided. 

There are two major cons to this place. 

1) I like spicy food and usually order a 7\/10 wherever I go.  In this instance I went with a sizeable group of people, all who like it spicy. In this instance 7 was way spicy. More like a 10 or 11 and I wasn't the only one with this assessment. 


2) While the food was very good, $11.95 for the lunch portion just seemed too high.

So I was lucky enough to go twice here over the course of the weekend. I went Saturday (5:30PM- opening time) & Sunday 6PM, both without reservations. At opening, you may see a massive line, but it moves fast and you get a seat almost right away. If you wait a half hour, the wait bumps up to 1 hour. So either get a reservation or go right when it opens. 

After coming here twice, I have to give Lotus of Siam all around compliments:

1) The staff-  they are very friendly and amazingly fast.   If you are in a rush , you can go from seating to check in 30 min. But at the same time, if you are enjoying yourself and chatting, they do not rush you. 

2) The management's ethics- While I was waiting for a table on Sunday, about six 60+ year old customers (not sure which European country they hailed from) came in and seemed highly annoyed about an hour wait. Those of us patiently waiting (which included grandparents and children) watched as one man in the group pulled out a wad of cash,and tucked $40-60 dollars in his palm to bribe the staff for a table. This guy continued to haggle with the staff for about 10 minutes. But the staff continued to decline his bribe and did not let him skip ahead of anyone. They gained a huge amount of respect from me and the the other dinner's who saw these events play out.

3) The food- Delicious and extremely well priced. Now I enjoy a really spicy meal and want to roll my eyes when people ask me ""are you SURE you want spicy...it's really spicy!""  I usually like it as hot as it comes. But something made me feel like the food was going to be authentic here so I went ""medium spice."" For me this was perfect, enough to tingle the lips and make the nose run a little, but not too much to make me chug a glass of milk. If you cannot handle spice, go well below medium.

Appetizers I tried: 
-Golden Fried Tofu (like any other place, good but nothing unique)
-Nam Kao Tod (Small dish but packed with spice and flavor, really loved this)

Dishes I tried: 
-Chili & Basil Seafood combo (delicious with rich basil flavor, good kick to it too)
- Pad Se Ew (basic dish but well made)
-Thum Ka Noon (Rich, spicy dish with jackfuit but not heavy at all, one of my favorites)
- Kang Hung Lay (sweet and spicy pork curry, heavier dish but packed with flavor)

Dessert: 
-Mango and sticky Rice (basic dish but really fresh mango and rice was not dried, delicious!)

It had been a while since I was last here and I was really looking forward to a great LOS experience.  Several years ago, I ate here so often and brought in so many people that the staff even gave me a free shirt.

Alas, those glory days are over.  Their portion sizes have shrunk, the prices have gone up, and the service leaves something to be desired.  

I arrived early for dinner to beat the wait and when my party of 4 was seated, they only gave us 2 menus and no wine list.  After a little while, the server came over to take our drink order.  When we let him know that we wanted to order wine, but we still weren't offered a wine list.  I decided not to push the issue and went with just a glass of his choosing instead of a bottle and then placed our dinner order.

Our appetizer was stuffed chicken wings.  2 chicken wings for $11.   They're good chicken wings, but not $11 good.  With a party of 4 people, I'm surprised our server didn't advise us that there would only be two.  Try putting 4 on the plate and then the pricing might make sense.  

The combination beef noodle soup was very good. I'll admit - I'm an Asian soup noodle guy.  Love the pho, wonton soup, beef stew, and ramen.  This is a nice dish that holds its own with the greats.  Beef, meatballs, noodles, fragrant broth, and garnished with fried pork skin.  Good portion at a very reasonable price.  

Our Pad Thai tasted great, but the portion size was about half of what I remember them serving in the past.  Since we were all sharing dishes, it wasn't a huge deal, but it would take at least 2 of these orders to equal what you would get at most other Thai restaurants in town.     

The whole Thai BBQ chicken was meh.  Seasoning was okay, but I'm guessing it had been left over from lunch (or earlier), as it came out of the kitchen at room temperature only 3-4 minutes after ordering it together with the duck (and before our appetizer).  It had that ""stale chicken"" texture that old supermarket rotisserie chicken has towards the end of the night when it's sat under the heat lamps for too many hours and becomes mealy.  Although it's cut into pieces, the chicken is somewhat small.  Not humanely raised tasty farm chicken small though.  The parts look like they came from a 22-24oz Cornish game hen.

My biggest disappointment of the evening came to the table in the form of panang crispy duck.  This used to be my favorite dish and I was really looking forward to it.  When the entree came out, it was a fraction of the size of its former self.  The duck was not fried to order and the panang did not have the same richness and depth that it used to.  Was it horrible?  No.  Would I order it again?  Absolutely not.  I asked the server about the portion size of not only this dish, but the rest of them as well and he replied that they all appeared to be fine.  I asked why the duck portion had shrunk so much and he informed me that the portion was only supposed to be 1\/4 of a duck.  He said that he hadn't worked there very long but it's been that way as long as he'd worked there.  1\/4 of a duck with totally unremarkable panang for $25?  Yikes!  It used to be a whole roasted duck, butterflied, de-boned, and then flash fried to order for that price.

The verdict?  Completely average food, small portions, and big prices.  From now on, I'll be heading over to Spring Mt to get my Thai food fix when I'm in Las Vegas.  I have to wonder what sort of horrible Thai food that the other reviewers on here are eating which causes them to give LOS 5 stars?  Oh, how I yearn for the days when LOS was a small hole in the wall and there was still a wig shop next door.

The good news out of all of this?  The gay bar at the entrance of the Commercial Center called Spotlight (which has always been and is still very straight friendly) received a full remodel inside and out recently.  Service is fantastic and well drinks and beer are still 2 for $4 during happy hour.  So, if your heart's set on overhyped mediocre Thai food, you can still grab a drink next door while waiting for your table.",0,0,0

When a restaurant is heralded as the best Thai food in North America, it has to be good. Only down side was my expectations going in were sky high. However it really says something when not only was I not let down but my expectations were actually exceeded. 
I've heard that everything on the menu is great and so far that's true although some things are a bit more amazing than others. I've been here twice so far, and both times have ordered number #14 on the appetizer menu. I can't remember the exact name of it but I refer to it as crispy rice salad. One of the best dishes I can remember getting in a long time. 
The menu is very long and has a bigger variety than most typical Thai restaurants so you might need some guidance. On my first visit, the server recommended Sea Bass Drunken Noodles. I saw a prior reviewer mention it was ""like crack"" and I would have to agree with them. The Sea Bass was very tender and the noodles and sauce were very flavorful. The next time I came, I forced myself to try something different. The server recommended some sort of noodle dish that was more like soup. It was still good but I definitely preferred the drunken noodles to it. But really, seems like you can't go wrong with almost anything here.
We actually tried to come to Lotus of Siam several years ago but we thought we were in the wrong place since the center its in looks a bit run down, to put it nicely. So if you have never been here, be forewarned. Once you enter however, the place looks legit. Take a glance at all the pictures of celebrities and famous chefs who have dined here to convince you.
My only complaint is that they are not open for lunch on weekends. Since its location is a bit out of the way, it's more convenient to come to for lunch and I would guarantee I'd be here on every Vegas trip if I could come in for lunch on a Saturday or Sunday. On my last week Vegas trip, I literally scheduled my trip around a lunch visit here by going on a long weekend and staying through Monday. I won't always have that option though so unfortunately I'll probably miss out on the deliciousness of Lotus of Siam on some future trips to the desert.",0,0,0

The service was on excellent with our water (which was delicious, and perhaps the best part of the meal considering we had been out drinking the night before) always being refilled. In addition, the food was served timely and tasted delicious. The specific dishes we tried are listed below:

Pad thai - 5\/5
Perfectly seasoned, not over-cooked. No sauces were overwhelming, and the dish was not at all greasy

Drunken Noodles with Beef - 3\/5
The noodles were fine, and the beef was seasoned okay. The downside of this dish was that the noodles did not hold any flavor and the sauce washed away the seasoning from the beef to make it taste extremely bland relative to the other dishes order; thereby making it not as enjoyable.

Garlic prawns - 5\/5
Crunchy, well-seasoned, large serving size, and not greasy at all. This was my favorite dish

Panang curry with chicken - 5\/5
The curry tasted amazing, and the amount of chicken included was very reasonable relative to the size of the dish and amount of curry sauce. Goes well with the steamed rice, which is free by the way.",0,0,0

I must say the ""noodles,"" which aren't very noodley but rather flat and wide and irregular shaped, were fantastic. The shrimp dish was good, but I had to wipe some of the peppers off.  our appetizer was yummmmmmy too, chicken on a stick :)

Obviously order off the menu.

The best Thai laab (we did the raw beef and pork), seafood soup, and curry ever.  Their wine list is so well-curated that the folks in the Mosel valley would be jealous of their encyclopedic riesling options.  Their rieslings are top-notch.  And it did pair so well with the spicy Thai food.

The menu at Lotus of Siam is extensive with the menu split into regional cuisine. (Northern, Southern, etc.) My bf and I had decided early on that we would eat at the lunch buffet instead so we arrived at around 11:45 am and the restaurant was already pretty packed. Lotus of Siam opens at 11:30 am and the lunch buffet is served from 11:30 am-2:30 pm.
 
For $10.99 a person, the lunch buffet is worth the price because there were many different options (steamed, stir-fry and fried) to select from. There was your standard sliced fruit (green melon, watermelon and pineapple) and salad. The Thai food included steamed white rice, Thai fried rice, chow mein, pad thai, pad see ew, chicken green curry, a tofu stir-fry and another vegetable stir-fry. The fried food included: egg rolls, curry wontons, tempura and delicious fried bananas! There were also 2 types of soups available: a hot and sour soup and a soup with clear broth. My bf preferred the soup with the clear broth and vegetables.
 
For me, the stand out dishes were the pad thai and green chicken curry! Both were tasty and the green chicken curry had large chunks of both vegetables and chicken. I even went back for seconds of the curry! 

The service was good. It looked like there were only 1-2 people working the front of the restaurant and our waters were refilled.
 
Bottom line: This Thai place may be out off the strip but it is well worth the drive for good AYCE Thai food. If I return, I will probably order off the menu next time to compare with the AYCE food.",0,0,0

The jerky gets a mixed review. The pieces that I was able to chew and eat were really great. Great beef flavor with a great mix of spices. No sauce needed. However, there were a couple of pieces in the order that were inedible due to being too chewy and fatty. 

The curry was forgettable. The beef short ribs were not that great either. I ended up throwing away a lot of it. 

I definintely want to try other items on my next trip through LV. Worth the visit, but please order take out and avoid the crowds.",0,0,0

I had an opportunity to read the articles all over the waiting area in the twenty minutes or so of wait time, so I learned that Lotus of Siam has been open since around 2000. Amazing. I'll bet the plaza in which they're located was also pretty rundown back then, but the quality of their food has probably not lessened and their reputation has only soared. I did my research this time and, along with some appetizer suggestions from my mom, we picked a lot of specialties and Northern Thai menu options.

The food arrived all at once after perhaps fifteen minutes. Patience is a virtue, as we were rewarded with delicious food. For starters, the tod mun plar (#7, $8.95) was a great take on a deceptively simple fish cakes with nice pickled cucumber. The nam kao tod (#14, $7.95), everybody's favorite crispy rice dish, was definitely yummy but a little too sour for my taste. Also very delicious but not suited for my palate was the yum nuah (#36A, $12.95), which is a great beef salad that's just too spicy for me and paralyzed me in fire and sweat for a few minutes. The spicy catfish with basil leaves (#85, $14.95) was a solid if small portion of sauteed fish in a basil sauce

After recovering from the yum nuah, I delved into the Northern specialties. The khao soi (#A, $9.95) was one of my favorite tastes of the meal. To call it an egg noodle curry is not nearly doing it justice, so I'll just say that you'd better order it when you get the chance. The kha nom jean nam ngyow (#G, $9.95) is a non-spicy pork and rice vermicelli dish that reminds me slightly of a certain Vietnamese dish called bun rieu, but I wouldn't have this one again as it seemed a bit boring compared to some other dishes. The last item from this part of the menu was the nam prik ong (#I, $10.95), a non-spicy dish consisting of a red chili paste and various items to dip into it. Pretty nice, possibly worthy of a repeat, but not a palate dazzler either.

I think the best item we had may have been the garlic prawns (on the chef's choice menu, $22.95). They are certainly pricey, and they are actually kinda worth it. Very crunchy, perfectly cooked, and just delicious. And even considering the modest portions of other dishes, definitely a splurge.

Having finally had items from the proper menu, I can now confidently express my opinion that Lotus of Siam deserves all of its praise. I don't know if I'd tell somebody to fly here just for one restaurant, but when you are in Las Vegas, you must make this a destination. Oh, and you'll definitely want to reserve well in advance if you choose dinner hours. Just saying.",24,8,17

I gave in to the hype and put it on my ""Places to Eat At"" list when I recently went to Vegas. Mind you, I was with my family and, my step mom is Thai. I thought it would give me bonus stepdaughter points so I was pretty excited to bring her to Lotus of Siam. 

The Crispy Catfish Salad was great! The catfish pieces were fried crispy perfection and the salad tasted light to me. The dressing wasn't too salty nor too sour. I definitely loved it and was excited to have our other orders come out. 

The food sure did start to come out one by one and sadly, I got disappointed. I don't know if it was because maybe what we ordered weren't their ""stellar"" dishes but oh, boy. I wasn't a happy camper. We got the Tom Yum Goong, Panang Curry, Pad Thai and my dad got an extra bowl of noodles in soup with meatball type things floating. 

I'm sorry, but my go-to spot in Thai Town in L.A. does a better job at preparing what I had ordered. That Tom Yum Goong was just pure sourness with no kick whatsoever (my stepmom asked them to make it spicy in Thai). The Panang and Pad Thai were both on the sweeter side as well. My stepmom agreed to what I had to say as well and, she's a straight-up, legit Thai lady herself. I only have the privilege of saying that I've been to Thailand but she's got it all in her blood. Her opinion has to count as something, right?

I'm not ready to cross them out my list just yet. Everyone definitely deserves a second chance and I could have made a mistake in ordering Thai staples but, that's what scares me too.

The duck panang was probably my favorite of them all. The duck was cooked well and the curry that accompanied the dish was phenomenal. I could probably pour it on any and everything and be satisfied.

Our party of 4 tried:

Koong Sarong - Very good, not greasy at all. Good dish for the less adventurous people in your party.
Nam Kao Top - (Spicy Level 4) While very limey, it's balanced much better when eaten with the cabbage.
Garlic Prawns - My favorite dish of the night. I was not a huge fan of eating the shell but I tried it and enjoyed one. The shell was much more tender than I thought it would be but a little on the salty side. The actual prawn meat was delicious, perfectly cooked with a slight crisp on the outside.
Crispy Duck with Panang - (Level 3) While I'm not a huge fan of duck, I had heard a lot about this dish and had to try it. The duck was cooked perfectly, crispy skin and moist on the inside. The meat was not overly fatty like I'm used to eating and the curry sauce was different (no coconut milk) but a great addition to the overall flavor.
Nua Nam Tok - (Spice Level 4) Very similar to the flavors of the Nam Kao Top, good but not great.

We noticed many people ordering the soups, especially the Fish Soup but it was over 105 degrees that day and soup was the furthest thing from what I wanted. It looked wonderful and will be my order when I go back in the winter.

Lotus is perfect for taking visiting friends from out of town who want to experience Vegas food off the strip. The food is good, the service was incredibly good, way better than I expected. If you're lucky you can start up a conversation with the James Beard winning Chef Saipin Chutima who was spotted multiple times walking through the dining area.

I got the drunken noodles with soft shell crab at a level 2 because I am not into spicy foods and it still had a little cook to the juice. 

My friend got a number 8 and was in tears, haha. I guess it goes from 0-10 so see what you can handle if that is what you like. The service is good, when you walk in you feel like its a small place because the lobby\/waiting area is tiny but plenty of space in the dining area.

We also ordered their pineapple fried rice ($11.95). Rice was soft and fluffy with delicate sweetness and it was really tasty. One of the best I've had. We wanted to order another dish so I went full on review reading mode on Yelp and settled for their chicken khoa soi ($10.95).

Don't be a dumbass and not make a reservation.  If you are going to vegas and have about a week of notice, you should be able to get a slot no problem.  It's not a ridiculous wait for walk-ins, but it's an unnecessary wait if you just pick up the phone.

The food.

In short, thai food executed at a high level without being pretentious.

My recommendations:  

Appetizers:

Spicy garlic chicken wings - These wings are deep fried to get the skin nice and crispy and glazed in a sweet garlic chili sauce that make for the right balance of sweet, spicy, salty and crispy.

Nam Kao Tod:  
Crispy rice with pieces of pork and green onion.  This dish, if I recall correctly has some spice to it.  Not for everyone, but a nice textual accompaniment.

Mains:

Pad Thai - A refreshingly light take on something that can be bogged down with sauce.  The right balance of noodles, peanuts and sauce.

Pad See Ew - This was good, I don't recall what was in it exactly

Garlic prawns - If you order anything from this list, make sure you order these.  These are large prawns that are breaded and deep fried to the point where the shells are edible (if you don't mind a bit of chewing).  These are my favorite here.

Panang curry - I'm not a curry fan, but this was good.

In short, catch a cab and look for the weird Green Door massage parlor and you'll see the line out the door for this place.   If you have reservations, you'll have a great dinner.",2,0,0

I've only had Thai in about 4 places, so I'm not educated enough to say it's the best anywhere, but it is certainly the best I've ever had. 

Place is in a real hole. I mean, I'd NEVER drive into this outdoor mall area on a whim. But don't judge it from the outside. Interior is perfectly fine and clean. Recent expansion helps a lot. I was here in 2008 and found it to be wildly good, but cramped and hot. Not a problem anymore. 

Menu is diverse and complete. I like the ""jerky"" appetizer a lot, then moved on to the Tom Kha Kai soup, spicy thai salad, noodles, curries, and more basil noodles. Nothing was short of very good. Some of it excellent. Thai beers perfectly neutralize the flamthrower heat put off by those evil little green thai chiles. Easily the hottest damn thing I've ever bitten into thinking it was part of a green bean or something. I was sweating like Mac in the movie Predator talking about the ""same moon, different jungle"" while dry shaving his cheek. 

My single criticism is menu descriptions like ""Plar Dook O-Cha"" do nothing for this English only American. Waiters have thick accents and do not seem to follow requests of ""what is this?"" when pointing at the menu. But, that's really my problem being so ignorant. Whatever it is, it's probably good or great anyway. 

Can't go wrong here. Good for groups or couples. Reasonably kid friendly too.

Started off with a small bowl of Tom Ka Kai and a bottle of excellent Riesling.  I figured the Tom Ka Kai would be similar to the offerings in my home town given the simplicity of the ingredients, but LoS managed to even step that up....delicious.  For anyone who isn't familiar the soup consists of coconut milk, galanga, ginger, lime juice, chicken, mushrooms, fish sauce and a little black pepper.

Next up was the only dish I had eaten on my one prior trip here,  the Garlic Prawns.  These were just as good as I remembered.  Salty, sweet, crunch with a strong garlic and black pepper kick.  Shrimp were impeccably fresh and clean tasting.  Don't be scared of the fact that the shrimp shells are included......they literally turn to delicious crackers.

After eatings the prawns, which I already knew I loved, I actually expected to be let down my the following main courses, but I was pleasantly surprised.   We had our waiter, whose name I unfortunately can't remember(he was excellent), recommend us a signature dish and a noodle dish.  He recommended the Pad Se Eww for the noodles and Charbroiled Beef in a Young Peppercorn Sauce.  The former was excellent with perfectly cooked wide flat noodles, sweet\/salty brown sauce and crunchy chinese broccoli.........but the Charbroiled beef was the thing of legends.  Beef cooked nicely medium with crunchy green beans and green bell pepper served with a savory brown sauce heavily flavored with the intensely vibrant and sharp taste of young peppercorns.  This makes for a unique and brilliant combination of flavors.

I can't state whether this is, as reviewed, the ""best Thai restaurant in North America"", but I think I can safely assume they make a VERY strong case.

We got there at 5:15pm and sat in the car, then slowly a line of people started to form. We literally got a table when they open at 5:30pm. Service was amazingly quick and attentive. The food arrived within 5 to 10minutes. The price is on the higher end for Thai food- average about $15 to $30 for entree, but it's well worth it. The menu is very extensive and it's sorted by the region of Thailand.  

The garlic prawn comes with 8 generous pieces and flash fried with garlic seasoning. It was delicious and the shrimp was crispy. The prawn was deshelled therefore consumption is very convenient. 

The crispy duck with the noodle was one of my favorite. The duck was tasty with a crispy skin. The flat rice noodle was slightly pan fried and complimented the duck really well. Pretty much, it's  similar to the Chinese chow fun (pan fried rice noodle) atop with crispy duck. 

The Thum ka noon was minced pork with jackfruit. We randomly ordered this and it was interesting. It would be really good if it's eaten with rice.

I mean, this place has gotten crazy reviews from everyone about being the best Thai place not only in Vegas but also North America.  And I walked out of this place thinking it was good, but definitely not amazing.  And I went on a Friday night.  We were thinking that maybe I didn't get their best chef-but who doesn't use their best chef on a Friday night?

Well, I went with 4 other friends and we ordered a lot of different types of food.  We started with Tom Kah Kai which is a traditional coconut chicken soup almost every Thai restaurant makes.  It's ok.  Not great.  I've definitely had better.  I was a little surprised.  And I got myself a Thai tea.  Same thing, wasn't great.  Have definitely had much better.

We then got a spicy salad.  I don't remember which one.  This I liked more but only because it was really, really spicy.  Spicy and salads is a rare mix and it worked out with this salad.  But most my friends couldn't handle the spice.  I could barely handle it myself to be honest.  

We got a pad thai noodle dish, a pineapple fried rice and a fried sea bass dish.  Maybe, we got some more things though honestly I don't remember the rest.  Really tells you something when I can't quite remember what we ordered.  It's simply because the food wasn't that remarkable.  The sea bass was crazy disappointing.  I though we were getting an entire sea bass and only got a small cut of it.  I almost flipped the table over when they served the sea bass especially as it was the most expensive dish we got. $30 for this one plate.  Crazy, absolutely do not order this.  Completely overpriced.  You go to any other authentic Asian restaurant you're getting a whole fish for that kind of price.  Actually, you're getting a whole fish for less than that price.

So overall I was not impressed with this place.  Did I get the wrong chef?  I don't know.  I doubt different chefs are going to give you different portions of the fish-this is for sure.  So I thought the food was good and I wouldn't tell people to avoid this place.  But at the same time I don't think I'd come back here unless I was going with someone who'd eaten here multiple times and knew exactly which dishes to order and which ones not to.",2,0,0

Lotus is located in an unassuming strip mall north of the strip a stone's throw from the SLS Hotel. Not only is the exterior somewhat dilapidated but the surrounding establishments are a bit questionable. Affordable Dental? The Foot Lounge? All that doubt fades away as you enter the restaurant, which is lively- filled with people of all walks of life amidst an undeniable waft of Thai chilies and spices. I must admit service was a bit lacking at first. From the hostess that walked us in to the waiter who took our drink order, there didn't seem to be much effort put into being attentive. But this didn't really bother me considering the sheer number of guests the restaurant was trying to attend to. Our waiter, on the other hand, was extremely friendly and helpful in choosing menu items that would suit our liking.

I decided to try their Thai Lime Drink that was made in house. The drink came to the table cloudy and mint blue in color. My immediate reaction was it was extremely crisp and refreshing. It wasn't too sweet with just enough zest for a puckering sensation. It was light, which paired well with the heavy flavors of Thai cuisine. 

For my entrée I ordered the Khao Soi: crispy duck over egg noodles with Northern Thai curry and wonton crisps. I ordered mine mild but traditionally it is eaten much spicier. Because the curry was light in spice the coconut milk had a very obvious presence. The curry itself was a bit watery unlike the thick Thai curries that I was used to. The egg noodles were mid-sized in width, cooked perfectly and paired well with the curry in that it wouldn't absorb too much of the flavor. The noodles were thin with a nice bite to them. I've noticed that the flavor of the protein in Thai curries usually takes a backseat and the textures of the meat are much more prominent. This dish was no different in that the duck had fantastic texture: it was cut in thick strips and the skin providing a satisfying crunch. Every couple of bites I would get a sprig of cilantro, which would cut the heaviness of the sauce or a wonton crisp with green onion that would add to the contrast of textures. 

Overall, I had a memorable experience at Lotus and it only further ascertained that I have a fervent passion for Thai cuisine.",0,0,0

Came for dinner on our last night in Vegas. We got there pretty much right when they opened at 5:30pm, and there already was a line! Good thing their restaurant is really big - after seating everyone with reservations they started seating walk ins. We didn't wait too long - probably 20 mins.

Thai iced tea ($4.95 USD)
I really liked the Thai iced tea. All the places where I've had Thai iced tea they were generally super sweet because of the condensed milk. Surprisingly, the Thai iced tea here wasn't too sweet! Strong in tea flavor but still with its nice creamy milk taste. I'm definitely a fan!

Nam Kai Tod ($8.95 USD)
This was a recommended appetizer. Crispy fried rice with pork and raw cabbage on the side. This was really interesting. I've never had deep fried fired rice - love the crunchy taste. The dish was a bit too salty for my liking, but it did balance out when you take a bite from the raw cabbage.

Crispy duck Panang ($27.95 USD)
This was my favorite dish. The crispy duck was really really good! The duck was lean, skin was crispy and thin without much white fat hanging in between the skin and meat. The duck meat was tender. The panang curry was on the sweeter end, stronger in coconut flavor - goes really well with rice. Loved this dish!

Pad Thai ($11.95 USD)
Pad Thai with chicken. There was a decent amount of chicken which was good, but overall the dish portion was small. The noodles were really thin, but I like the soft chewy texture. Flavors were on point. Tasty!

Khao Soi with beef ($10.95 USD)
The Khao Soi flavor was similar to the Panang except less coconuty. Decent amount of beef. Felt like it could use more noodles. This tasted good but it's slightly bland if you eat it on its own so make sure you add some soup in each bite to enhance the taste.
Food was good, but I wouldn't say it's the best Thai food I've had. It's quite expensive considering the portions are small. The Thai food is authentic and definitely above average though. Service is good too - all the staff were very knowledgeable with their menu and food items.",0,0,2

Side note: if you find yourself in a sketchy strip mall and see a tiny storefront with a sign that says Lotus of Siam and are 70% sure you're in the wrong place, you're in the right place. 

Once you get inside, the restaurant is actually really big. Decor is nothing to speak of, but definitely better than the outside would lead you to believe. 

Prepare yourself--the menu is overwhelmingly huge. After consulting Yelp and getting advice from our server, we went with the garlic prawns, drunken noodle with mixed seafood, crispy duck curry, a small Singha and a Thai lime drink, and sticky rice with coconut ice cream for dessert. Our bill, without tip, was almost $90. 

I don't have a problem paying good money for good food, but it just didn't seem like the price was warranted. Our meal was fine, but not outstanding. 

The garlic prawns has a great texture but seemed oily and didn't have as much flavor as I would have hoped. The prawns are pulled out of the shells, but the shells are left attached at the tail, so you have the prawn and shell separately deep fried. I would never known that you are supposed to eat the shells, but, thanks to good ol' Anthony Bourdain, my husband is more up on these sorts of things than I. The texture of the breading and the shell, and the flavor and crunch of the cabbage slaw with cilantro underneath the prawns, which was coated with garlicky goodness, were the best parts of this dish. 

The drunken noodles with mixed seafood weren't bad, but weren't better than any other drunken noodles I've had. 

The crispy duck curry was by far my favorite dish. Red panang curry, a generous serving of duck breast with perfectly crisped skin, and some red bell pepper. Most flavorful dish on the table, with a little bit of heat. 

I loved the Thai lime drink--basically limeade, tart and sweet but not too sweet, with a tiny salt. 

The sticky rice was meh, which was sad because sticky rice is one of my favorite things. Would've ordered it with mango, but they didn't have any, so went with coconut milk ice cream instead. 

Maybe we ordered the wrong things? Maybe they were having an off night? I don't know. The same meal for a more reasonable price would've gotten four stars from me, but it was way too expensive for what it was. 

The service was great. Shout out to Ettel--he was absolutely amazing! He wasn't our server, but took our drink orders and cleared our table, and was SO friendly and attentive.",13,5,6

The Panag Nua was tough and lacking in flavor. It was a true Panag curry but it just seemed watered down. The meat had been just sliced and tossed in. Normally good Thai places have nice chunks of beef that they let stew in it all day so the sauce permeates it and the meat just falls apart. 

The Yum Yai salad had almost no sauce and what litte sauce it did have lacked in any flavor.

The Tom Ka Guy soup was watery and heavily lacking in taste. The chicken in it was dry and huge chunks that were just not right for a soup. It also lacked a decent amount of mushrooms.

The Kow Pat Moo was totally flavorless for a Thai fried rice. It was more like over priced panda express Chinese fast food rice.  This is a huge failure. I mean how hard is it to toss nam plaud and sugar into some rice? 

The Phad Thai was soggy and had more the consistency of spagetti with marinara then a thai fried noodle dish. 

The saving grace was the moo sautee. It was nice and small like you would get on the streets of bangkok. It did taste good but then again that's the staple of Thai places and you would have to go out of your way to screw this one up.

All this being said my friends liked it BUT none of them have ever tried Thai food before much less GOOD Thai food. I think this must be the case for a lot of the positive reviews here. An other negative reviewer pointed out that there simply no Thai people in there this does tend to be a good indicator as to if a Thai place is good.",0,0,0

The strip mall it's in is sorta ghetto and depressing (tons of parking, though), but the restaurant itself is nice and quaint.  I heard that it's tough to get a table, so we got there about 10 mins before they opened on a Wednesday.  There were already two other people waiting for them to open, as well.  A steady stream of folks were filling up the seats as soon as they opened.  By the time we left, almost all the tables were full.

The food is good, but to be honest, didn't blow my mind.  I think all the hype set my expectations pretty high.  The food was still great, though.  We ordered the larb to start.  It was tasty, but there was definitely a lot more rice than meat.  We also got the crsipy prawns, which was my fave. They take the shrimp out of the shell, but still leave it connected, then they deep fry it, so you have one part fried shell and one part fried shrimp.  Really tasty.  We got the drunken noodles, too.  They were OK - was like a brothy pad see ew.  I was expecting a thicker sauce, but it felt more soupy than saucey.  We didn't order wine, but their wine cellar was HUGE and they had a bunch of awards on the wall for their wine list.

The service was AMAZING!  Extremely attentive, friendly and knowledgable.  They really made the experience great.  They also have a huge menu, so there's a lot of dishes to choose from.

But I do want to make one suggestion to Yelpers:  Please, please, PLEASE look at the Northern Thai section of the menu.  While the rest of the menu is very, very good (especially loved the Garlic Prawns and Sea Bass on Drunken noodles), the Northern Thai section offers dishes that you won't find at most Thai restaurants.  We had two standouts, both based on recommendations of our very attentive waiter.

The first was Kang Ka Noon, which is jackfruit in a spicy curry sauce.  An article on NPR says that these are the largest tree fruit in the world, reaching up to 100 lbs each, and high in protein, potassium, and vitamin B2 (and yes, they are quite an interesting looking fruit).  However, when it is cut up and put into a dish, the jackfruit has the consistency of an artichoke heart.  Smooth, creamy and delicious.  And the curry sauce adds the perfect spice to balance the simple sweetness of the fruit.

The second dish was Khao Soi, a curried, egg noodle dish (with Burmese flavor influences) that we had with chicken.  Much like Pho has its salad accompaniment, so does Khao Soi:  onions, mustard greens, and lime.  Oh my goodness was this dish fantastic.  It was clearly the hit of the night.

So if you are an adventurous foodie (and you likely are if you are reading reviews in Yelp), step away from the traditional and go right for the Northern part of the menu.  You will not be sorry.",8,0,0

It took forever to get water (I had to ask for it when he finally came to take my order) and he never came back to ask how my appetizer was.  When my main course came out, I asked the runner for more water (I had finished the glass) and he never returned with it.  I also needed a clean small plate.  I waited and waited and finally flagged my server for those two simple things.  Then he didn't come back to check on me until I was 75% done with my main course.  And he wasn't slammed.

Don't go to any restaurant that has a James Beard Award and even think about the buffet. 
I've been here so many times that I can't list all the dishes I've had. NONE of them disappoint. If you're nervous or unfamiliar with Thai food ask your server for some recommendations. If you're familiar with Thai food, but not so familiar with Northern Thai food order a few familiar items and get at least ONE thing you've never had before.

I had the Nam Kao Tod appetizer which was great. Good amount of food for an appetizer dish and it tasted amazing. I would order this again.

We started off with the Thai Beef Jerky and Tom Yum Soup and they were both very flavorful and great. I've been told I have to try the stuffed chicken wings, but have yet had the chance to try them.  As for our main courses we asked for a recommendation from the wait staff. We ordered the Sea Bass cooked in the Drunken Noodle style. This was by far the best Thai dish I have ever eaten!

I got a Thai iced tea as a drink and it was perfect - not too sweet. I ordered the tom yum soup with shrimp to start. Wow this was SPICY. I have a very, very high spice tolerance and this was actually spicy to me for once. It was delicious though!

As my entree, I got my staple drunken noodles with seafood. Boy... These were good - during my meal and as cold leftovers!

My other friends ordered the crispy duck with noodles (highly recommended!!), pad Thai, pad see ew, etc. and they all seemed to enjoy it.

After perusing the huge menu at length, we settled on splitting a large bowl of Tom Kah Kai Soup; Pad Woonsen with shrimp, chicken, beef, sauteed Cellophane Noodles, tomatoes, Black Mushrooms, egg, Green Onion, White Onion, and Cilantro; Garlic Prawns; and Thai Crab Fried Rice.  Our competent and efficient server asked what spice level between 1 and 10 we desired for the soup, and Norm said ""7"" while I simultaneously said ""2 or 3"".  Norm charitably agreed to a ""3"".  The soup was excellent, cooked with Coconut Milk in the classic manner.  And, while I found the spice level to not be overwhelming, it qualified as a bit higher than mild.

Pad Woonsen with several ingredients and our three types of protein was a fine, satisfying dish.    And, the vaunted Garlic Prawns deserve their reputation; they were outstanding.  Tasty enough that to my surprise I, too, ate the well-cooked prawn shells, and enjoyed them in addition to the crustacean nestling inside!  

Only the Thai Crab Fried Rice, with tomatoes, onion, and crab meat was a disappointment: bland with little noticeable pieces of clam.  Making up for this, the complimentary large-grain Steamed White Rice was superior to the customary plebeian variety served at most Asian restaurants.

First of all the location is not great -- I'll give it a ""D."" It is in a run down kind of trashy shopping center with several next-door stores with windows boarded up. The restaurant itself is not all that attractive with plain walls, old kind of tacky  pictures on the white wash walls but -- understandably because the food reviews are so good -- the place is very crowded and noisy with zippo privacy. Probably not the best place to impress a date. I'll give restaurant appearance and ambience a ""C-.""

Service was not any better for us than your average busy Chinese restaurant.  We had to work to get our waiters attention. He wasn't all that friendly, was not dressed as you would expect a waiter serving in such a famous place and he got our orders wrong. Worse yet all our food was brought out at one time appetizers, soup and main dishes so we could not savor any one of them which further detracted from the experience. 

Now for the food:
The crispy duck with panang curry was wonderful crisp skin flavorful sauce tender meat. ""A.""

The crispy duck with Thai basal was equally outstanding. ""A.""

The garlic fried prawns with seperately fried shells  were crispy light not oily but a little dry perhaps overcooked. It came out lukewarm. Garlic flavor was not in any way special and price was kind of steep. I actually would prefer a high end Japanese restaurant shrimp tempura. The dish tasted better when we put a little panang curry from the duck dish onto it. ""B.""

Tom yum chicken soup ok nothing special in the flavor or prep compared to any other descent Thai restaurant. ""B.""

Green Papaya salad with fish sauce. I hate to say this but I have this classic dish at nearly every Thai restaurant I go to and this one was quite mediocre. the texture suffered from shredding that was too coarse. The papaya was either too old or pre-shredded some time in advance which made it soggy and unacceptable. The texture also suffered from having too much sauce drowning the papaya and the flavor was not different enough from any other Thai restaurant to recommend this dish. ""C.""

The chicken Satay was one of the dishes recommended on the Internet and it came out tender with a nice peanut sauce which was  good but not any better than any other decent Thai restaurant. ""B.""

Chilean sea bass over drunken noodles with basal was very good perfectly cooked with lively flavors The only negative was the noodles were a little soggy and the size of the dish was kind of small relative to the price. ""A-.""

Jackfruit relish salad with carrots cucumbers lettuce was not particularly exciting in flavor texture or presentation. I won't grade it because I cannot compare it to anything else similar I will only state that it was not  good enough  for us to order again. 

Sticky rice with mango was good but not extraordinary. I'll give it a ""B.""

Will I come back? Probably not because the location service and ambience are below average price is quite high and food --at least the dishes we had were mediocre to good only.

The menu is extensive, and the food was great! I particularly enjoyed the texture of my crispy duck. I also ordered the shredded green papaya salad; it was good, but I've definitely had better. They offer a 0-10 spice level, and I ordered somewhere on the low-medium side and the spiciness barely registered; I definitely need to pick a higher number next time.

My biggest qualm with Lotus of Siam is the somewhat outrageous prices. I know duck is usually more expensive, but I think my duck dish was $25+, and not even that big of a portion. At a Cantonese restaurant, you can get an entire peking duck for that much money!

2. Tom yum Kai: 3\/5 tasty but lukewarm. I expected it to be steaming hot, but it felt like the bowl had been sitting out for a while before it was served.

3. Crispy pork belly (#87): 0\/5 can be a true delicacy if done right. Lotus, however, did not get it right. It was cold and the portion was abysmal for the price. I could have taken a slab of bacon and fried it with better flavor

4. Drunken noodles with seafood: 0\/5 again, portion was small for the price. To add insult to injury, they used fake imitation crab!!! That's disgusting.

Located in a strip mall cluster of Asian stores that look boarded up and whose names are hard to read, Lotus of Siam eluded me on the first attempt, but I'm glad I pursued it by way of a back street that revealed just how big this shopping center is.  This might help: it is right next door to Namaste Indian.  The restaurant is one of many that line a massive deserted parking lot that will make you think twice about getting out of your car, but inside the feeling was totally different.  

The servers were super friendly and helpful, and there were sane people there, sitting at tables, wearing clothes, on lunch breaks from office jobs or sober enough today to make it a few miles off the strip with cheerful faces, the ability to form coherent sentences, and the sense to seek out real food at reasonable prices.  What a relief!

I'm not a fan of buffet, and looking at this one didn't change my mind.  The selection was limited and the items looked like typical buffet food.  However, for those interested, the couple of main entrees looked decent and smelled good, and the $8.99 it costs seems more than fair.  

I opted for the menu and was completely satisfied.  Interestingly, they have a northern Thai food section, and I got the first dish listed.  It is an egg noodle dish served in a red coconut curry broth.  Even though it wasn't on the menu I was able to get tofu instead of chicken or beef.  The bowl of steaming sweet, spicy, sour, and creamy deliciousness is topped with cilantro, green onion, and a few fried noodles and served with a plate of ""sliced"" red onion, pickled cabbage, and a lime wedge.  The broth was absolutely delicious!  I savored each spoonful, and before I knew it had eaten the entire bowl.  It was the perfect portion for lunch.  

As for the garnish, the pickled cabbage had an interesting earthy taste underneath the vinegar, but I don't know what vegetable it was exactly.  The server thought it might be napa.  The only thing I would change would be the red onions which I think would have been much better if they were actually sliced rather than coarsely chopped as they were.  I love just about any vegetable ingredient, but huge chunks of raw onion are an exception.  

My general feeling for this place is gratitude and affection.  The food was excellent, the servers earnest, and the atmosphere perfect for decompressing from the chaos of the strip.  I would definitely come back if I happened through Vegas again, but then I might get too curious about the neighboring restaurants...",0,0,0

As most people know, the TV food shows love to rave about this place, in some cases with good reason, as we have our own favorite Thai restaurant (check my reviews, it isn't hard to figure out) and we would be eating there the following night, it gave me a good chance to compare dishes.

So direct comparison...

Chicken Sa-tay: Both restaurants do a good Sa-Tay, the taste of the chicken itself goes to Lotus, but it is close, however the other place has a far better peanut sauce.

Chicken Wings....Lotus all the way, man I could eat a bucket full of those babies.

Chicken Pad Thai...The other restaurant is far better, the taste element just isn't there with Lotus and there is a definite texture issue.

Chicken curry...Both places are good, I would say the other is slightly better.

Now to be fair, on previous trips to Lotus I have had to amazing dishes, they were specials of the day, but I think it is fair to mention at least one, the sea bass was amazing, I really wish they would put this one the menu, perfectly cooked, great texture and flavors.

On this last trip though, what really let it down was the service, we were the second group to be seated, the second group to order, our drinks we delivered quickly, the same with the appetizers..... Then nothing...for over an hour, fortunately our little group only gets to meet a couple of times a year, so we had plenty to talk about, but still, watching tables have their food delivered after they had been seated way after us is slightly annoying to say the least. The service itself was well remote to say the least, yes I know this place is busy no matter what, yes I know they will stay busy with the TV shows promoting them, but I really don't care, if the service stays like this then Lotus goes on my no dine list...

If not for the service Lotus would have gotten a 4 star rating from me, as ever food is an extremely personal thing, what one person may love another will hate, I have no issues recomennding Lotus, but there are better out there.",3,0,1

With that kind of a  claim, I had to try it out.  I was in Vegas for a conference, so I made it a point to get over to Lotus and punched the address into the GPS. 

We got there around 4pm, it was located off the strip.  When we got there, I was thinking ""this is it?"".  It was a HUGE, deserted strip mall, with a very empty parking lot.  All of the store fronts were plain and faded, definitely wasn't feeling very Vegas here.

You can't see into the restaurant, so we opened the door apprehensively and poked our heads in.  First thing you noticed is every square inch on their walls is covered with photos of celebrities eating there. The restaurant is pretty big, but was more or less empty when we sat down to order.

Admittedly, we didn't make the best selections in terms of gauging the true authenticity.  I had Curry Duck, my friend had Curry Tofu and my other friend had BBQ Chicken.  My 2 friends had never had Thai food before, so I sort of held back.  Had I gone with more experienced Thai food eaters, I probably would have ordered several dishes to eat family style.  But I didn't want to risk it with them, since the prices are a little higher and we couldn't take anything back to the conference with us.

However, the food was still great and both of my friends couldn't stop talking about how good it was, and how they had to bring their wives the next time.  My friend that ordered the chicken was stoked, since his order was huge, practically an entire chicken.

When we looked up from our meals, the restaurant, was packed!  Not a table in the house was available.  On our way out, I looked on some of the other tables and some of the seafood dishes I saw looked amazing.  I will definitely be returning here and next time, plan on trying many more, unique dishes.

Not a bad place, but I honestly think people say it's good just because other people say it's good. The prices were a dollar more expensive than people claim in Yelp, so they appear to keep hiking up the prices. People continue to line up and pay it, so I don't blame the restaurant for meeting market demand - I just don't understand it.

1) Garlic prawns.
Everyone says to get it, and the pictures look great. I ordered this, and the wrong thing came out. Turns out, there are two kinds and you need to clearly specify which one. The one in all the Yelp photos is the deep-fried version. Otherwise they give you the BBQ\/grilled version. The grilled version is not bad, but wish I knew. $26 is a lot for the wrong dish.

2) Khao Soi.
It's okay. I like how the noodles are fairly soft, but nothing special. 

3) Drunken seafood noodles.
This one was terrible. Normally I love wide, pan-fried rice noodle dishes, but this one came as a giant messy wet mush of dough as the noodles got soggy and fused together. I picked at the seafood and veggies and left all the noodles, which should've been slightly crispy on the pan-fried side and normally the best part of the dish.

I want to note that the staff seemed friendly. I just don't get the customer ratings; the same food or better is readily available at every other Thai restaurant for about $6.95 a dish.",1,1,1

My expectations were sky high because of it's reputation. Reviews are off the chart, and even the hotel bellman and the cab driver got excited at the mention of it. The cabbie yells ""hell yeah, that place is the bomb!""

I ordered the Garlic Prawns and the Crispy Duck in Drunken Noodle. The prawns were huge. They  are removed from their shells and butterflied, but still attached to their shells (at the tail). The prawns are then dredged in a seasoned batter and deep fried. The fried batter was similar to Japanese tempura and the flavor reminded me of the Chinese-style, deep fried salted shrimp. You can definitely eat both the shrimp and shell, and I like that they were separated. The garlic flavor is prominent. This is one of their most popular dishes, and it is a safe choice.

The duck dish was good, but I didn't think it was great. There was a generous amount of sliced duck. The dark duck meat was fatty and the skin was crispy. The drunken noodles are the flat wide noodles that are common in a lot of Asian dishes. The brown sauce was flavorful although I would have preferred it to be a bit more spicy. I ordered spice level of 6 out of 10 because I was expecting the Thai scale. Their heat scale is toned down for Westerners

Overall it was a good experience, and I'm glad we tried because of all the buzz. I have heard many people say it ""the best Thai food in America"".

We were party of 3, two Asians and one Caucasian. We had reservations for dinner and were seated promptly.   We love Southeast Asian food and have been to lots of Thai, Laotian, Burmese restaurants in California and Asia.  There were about 100 other diners in the restaurant when we arrived. There were many things that ended up being unique about this restaurant, unfortunately the quality of the food was not one of them. First, about 99% of clientele was Caucasian. This is never a good sign at an Asian restaurant. Everyone had a bottle of wine at their table. That's another oddity at an Asian restaurant.  Despite these two warning signs, we still felt we would be in for a great experience, based on yelp reviews.  We really weren't looking for ambiance, wine or decor. We were looking for ""the best Thai food in the US, as promised in these reviews.  We ordered the Northern Thai soup, which was ok but not balanced and way too heavy on fish sauce.  We had Nam Prik Onn, chili dip, which is a peasant dish popular in Northern Thailand and Burma. It usually  contains a bit of meat or fish in a very salty sauce into which vegetables are dipped.  It's eaten because meat and protein are rare and expensive in parts of thailand and Burma.  It gives a bit of taste to cheap veggie meals.  Here it was 10 bucks for a few tablespoons of something that tasted like middle america spaghetti sauce, a few vegetables to dip, and a handful of packaged chicharones (pork rinds) straight from the chips section of the local supermarket. We had Laotian style papaya salad, which was good. We also had crispy duck in chili mint sauce, deep fried fish in chili sauce, northern thai sausage.   We also had a combination dessert with coconut ice cream, sticky rice, mango, and banana wrapped in wonton wraps and deep fried.  Overall food was acceptable. Nothing was great. We had to add another dish at the end because we were still hungry at the end, portions were so small. No drinks except water. Bill came to $120 for 3 people. Add the $35 round trip cab fare from strip.  Absolutely ridiculous for mediocre Thai food. We went to a fantastic Laos \/ Northeastern Thai restaurant in East Oakland California a month ago and had almost the same things, with much better quality and larger portions for $39!

After reading the mostly awesome reviews of Lotus, I was eager to try it. I went with about 5 other girls for a bday dinner. We made reservations for dinner, so there was no waiting or anything like that.

Food: The food is delicious. While I do appreciate my go-to, hole-in-the-wall Thai place, ""King and I"", down the street, I think that the quality of Lotus' food is much higher. Some of the dishes we had (we had a lot, so I don't remember the names of all of them), but red curry with duck, panang curry with tofu and chicken, drunken noodles with sea bass, papaya salad, glass noodles with chicken, crispy rice, and a couple other dishes I can't remember. All of them were delicious. My personal faves were the drunken noodles and panang curry. We also had dessert...mango with sweet sticky rice, and fried bananas with ice cream....yummm! We also had two bottles of wine. It was a LOT of food, and we only ended up paying about $45 bucks each between 6 girls...a pretty good deal, considering how much we ordered, and we were stuffed at the end.

Service: The waiter was very attentive. Plenty of refills without asking. 

Decor: Nothing fancy, but it has a nice ambiance, moreso than your typical hole-in-the-wall.

Location: It's kind of in a sketchy part of neighborhood, Sahara Ave and  Commercial Ctr. There are some other restaurants around, like a Korean bbq restaurant.

Rain drops pattering on the windshield of our car, hard enough that the glass could just shatter. Pouring. Thunder in the backdrop. Screaming. Our phones beeped, ""FLOOD ALERT!""  Was this really a good day to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday? We didn't know what to expect when we pulled into this shady plaza off the strip, hoping to try the Lotus of Siam that everyone raved so much about. 

We were lucky, planning ahead and reserving our tables. As a word of advice, I suggest that you always ALWAYS reserve ahead of time before coming to this place. Even with such horrible weather, there were hordes of customers waiting outside in queue. 

Being seated into the restaurant, it was a bit overwhelming at first. It was crowded - so so crowded. There were pictures framed covering every inch of the walls, tables everywhere leaving little space for walking, kitchen staff and servers bustling and turning. The menu was extensive and we didn't know where to start and choose from. Our  server even forgot to give us our straws until perhaps 7 minutes into the dinner service. 

So then, why the 5 stars?

As we all know, it's the food. The food is what kept us happy and going, and saved this restaurant from being anything less than 5 stars. 

As there are descriptions of most of the food already in other reviews, I'll just list down what I loved, liked, and would pass. 

LOVED:

Garlic Prawns - it's expensive. A chef special. But the shells tasted like a crunchy chip, and the shrimp was fried to perfection. 

Seafood Thai Fried Rice - we actually ordered 2 of this because of the fact that the fried rice was so chunky! They really packed this with big, big pieces of seafood. It was worth it. 

Crispy Duck w\/ Panang Curry - Most people order this at at least a 5-8 in spicy level. My group ordered this in a 1. We don't handle spice well, but we still loved it! Although small, the duck was one of the best I've ever had and the curry sauce went will with my fried rice. 

Tom Kah Kai - I've never quite had a soup like it really, or maybe perhaps it was because I don't get Thai very often. The flavors went from tangy to sweet, always leaving you with a bunch of surprises at every gulp. 

Fried Whole Catfish - in my opinion, this was the real winner. We ordered this last minute, needing something BIG to get full (the dishes are small in size). I'm always quite skeptical of ordering catfish as they always end up tasting like mud paddies due to where they are caught. However they raise the catfish themselves, so it tasted amazing. I suggest ordering this first as it takes the longest to cook. 

Fried Banana w\/ Coconut Ice Cream & Sticky Rice - In the Philippines, we have a similar fried banana called Turon, however it fails in comparison to these. The fried banana didn't taste like it was drenched in glaze and oil. It was also fresh! The coconut ice cream tasted really good. Nothing like those that are store bough. The sticky rice was greatly balanced between too sticky and just plain soggy, a nice meet in the middle. 


LIKED:

Khao Soy - For people who like spicy food, this is a winner for you! As for me, I could only take about 2-3 spoonfuls before my tongue started burning for mercy. However, within those few bites, I loved the flavors it produced, sweeter and mild. We ordered this with chicken, but it was a bit dry. 

Tom Kah Kai - this also had a whole range of flavors to it. Minty, zesty, tangy. All I can say is that it was very complex. An array of flavors, but it was just right. The only thing was that at times, it was a bit too sour for me. 

Pad Thai - the pad Thai was good. Nothing more, nothing less. 

DISLIKED:

Nua Nam Tok - the beef was super dry unless you dip it in the sauce. The problem with this is that the beef is the main spotlight of the dish. Skip it. 

Thai Tea - I have to admit the drink was good. However, there was just so much ice and not enough tea; can you really call this a drink?

In contrast to entering the restaurant with mixed feelings, thinking it was overhyped, we left feeling happy and content. 

Also, kuddos to our waiter (he was the only one in yellow) who patiently dealt with our questions about what's good, not good, and recommended.",8,6,7

Ordered the beef larb, because my favorite promoter, Bhagya of Marquee, raved about how good it was. I thought it would come with rice but it doesn't. It's okay though. Very flavorful, nonetheless. We also order the traditional Pad Thai, in which it was not super oily. Thank gosh, because we all know I don't like oily Pad Thai. We also ordered soup but I forgot what kind it was. The Panang was very creamy and filled with veggies and meat. They don't cheap out. 

Pricing wise, not bad for Vegas food. I can see why my promoter liked the place so much. They were very attentive and there were a lot of waiters\/waitresses when we were there.

It's been deemed year after year as the best Thai restaurant in North America, and that's no exaggeration. 

I ordered the Panang Crispy Duck Curry, Beef Pad See Ewe, and Stuffed Chicken wings. Each dish was a flavor explosion, and culinary delight. Prices are very reasonable, and affordable.

I tried the nam kao tod as an appetizer, and it was AMAZING - the crispy rice with the pork sausages, lime juice, chili, and green onions make my mouth water. Hands down, the best Thai dish ever!!! I even looked up recipes online to try to replicate this dish at home. 

We also tried the garlic prawns that were deep fried; the dish was deliciously crunchy. Our third dish was the crispy duck in Khao Soi (thai egg noodles in a curry sauce). The crispy duck was yummy, but got a little soggy in the Khao Soi. It would have been slightly better if the crispy duck was separated from the Khao Soi, and combined the two later to maintain the crispness in the duck. 

The menu is quite extensive. My boyfriend and I were quite overwhelmed. We could only fit in three dishes between the two of us. I would highly recommend this place. You'd be really missing out if you don't give it a shot!

Lotus of Siam is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall off strip. Don't let the area scare you away, because you'll have a enjoyable meal. Nothing like a little bit of anxiety to stir up an appetite. Based on the looks of it, you wouldn't have guessed that it won a bunch of recognitions and popped up on shows and magazines.

Food:
1) Pad See Ew is always a safe and solid option. I always have to order it when I eat Thai.
2) Green Curry - I haven't had a bad experience with Thai curry, *Knock on wood* It was savory and creamy.
3) Crispy Rice - I didn't expect the crispy rice to be limy. I personally like the limy flavor, so I personally enjoyed it.
4) Tom Yum Soup was good. It didn't particularly stand out from all the other ones I've tried. Other than the price tag.

I'm still struggling with an internal debate of whether the place is overrated or if it is because we didn't get to try EVERYTHING on the menu... :P

Make reservations! The place fills up and you'll need them if you wish to eat.

I didn't get to try the buffet, but I hear that it is only offered for lunch and the quality\/food is different (note... not better or worse).

My friend and I ordered foods that we typically order from other Thai restaurants (for comparison purposes). We had the pad thai, pad see ew, green curry and drunken noodle with seafood.

I'm a little indifferent about the pad thai. My friend and I noticed that the tamarand sauce wasn't as strong so more of the other flavors came through (oils, peanuts, tofu, etc.). This can be interpreted as being a little more bland, but also appreciated since it wasn't overwhelming. My friend said that he's had better green curry. I haven't, but then again I haven't had too much of a comparison. The drunken noodle seafood was GREAT! With a plethora of seafood sprinkled all over a mound of noodles (flat rice noodles). This was all covered with gravy and makes my mouth water even now. The pad see ew was also delicious!

This is excessive eating for two but we were on a mission to try as much as we can until our next Vegas trip. The garlic prawns were huge with the shells loosely hanging on its meat. The flavors were blatant and the meat texture was done with the right crisp. For $25, there were eight pieces to share. The crispy duck was deboned and casually sitting on top of a pile of juicy and sticky bed of drunken noodles. There is an assortment of green and red peppers in the pile hence making it a very exotic dish. The thum ka noon is ground pork with shredded Jackfruit. It was a very flavorful dish that would be a good complement with rice but we ran out of room for the carbs.

My girl and I get there and we end up having to wait about 30 minutes since it was so packed (rightfully so) we did not mind as we were enjoying watching all the different foods come out of the kitchen and enjoying the accompanying smells.

We were seated and we started with the chicken satay, which came out with a nice peanut sauce and a small cooling cucumber salad. All together, they were quite enjoyable and it is the best peanut sauce I have personally had.

We next ordered the Charbroiled prawn with tamarind sauce, which also came with fresh chili garlic and lime sauce (which was ZOMG hot since I was not expecting it and coated my prawn rather well in it). The tamarind sauce I could not make out the tamarind taste it tasted more like maple syrup, which I know they added to help sweetened the sourness of the tamarind.

We next had the Pad Thai. I have never been too much a fan of this dish, but this was very good and I would have to say the best version of it I have ever had. It is rich in flavor, nice and thick and very tasty.
We next had the Chili Mussels with a chili, garlic, Thai basil sauce over the large half shell mussels. I really liked these; they were not too spicy and had a great fresh flavor.

We finished off the meal with a mango and sticky rice dessert; it was just fresh mango slices with sticky rice on the side. The Mango was very fresh and perfectly ripe and sweet. (So Nommy Good)

My girl had a nice glass of white wine with the meal, I was surprised to see the sheer amount of wines they have here in their wine storage area.

The service was fast and friendly and we were never left wanting for a refill on our drinks or them checking to see if everything was to our liking.

I can see why Chef Saipin Chutima has such great reviews and guest pictures all over the walls here.

I had high hopes for LoS after reading the foodie blogs.  We arrived on a Sat night around 7:30p sans reservation and entertained ourselves by walking around the strip mall during our 30 minute wait.  The staff was courteous.  Prices were a bit higher and portions were smaller than you'd find in Thai Town in Hollywood or at LoS's sister restaurant Renu Nakorn (Norwalk, CA).  We ordered two Issan specialties, kang hoh and nam kao tod (medium spicy), in addition to mango sticky rice and Thai iced coffee.  The kang hoh was less vinegary than Renu Nakorn's (a good thing), but contained something resembling overcooked beef stew meat, not pork as listed on the menu.  The nam kao tod was likewise somewhat disappointing - heavy on the rice with small cubes of purchased sausage.  Maybe I'm used to the nam kao tod at Khun Dom (Hollywood, CA), but I prefer it heavy on the fresh ginger and prepared with seasoned ground pork and pork skin with the rice as more of a topping.

The special spicy beef salad is amazing......they take an already excellent Yum Neua dressing and add hoisin sauce to create a masterful dressing like none other. It was killer.

The spicy chicken wing appetizer was also as good as I have had. We are madly in love with the same dish at Bangkok House in Kona and yet we thought this was even better....the sauce was richer and more garlic. Also a killer dish.

Lastly was the pineapple fried rice which has curry powder added as a twist....something not normally done in Thailand. The dish was perfect and so tasty.........but it was small and for the money they should be using fresh pineapple not canned. But it was still good enough no need to complain and even the curry powder was a nice touch.

Once the doors opened the staff was adequate. We were seated quickly and the food came out fast enough.

The problem is how unbelievably small the portion size is. I literally took 4 spoonfuls of my $12 massuman chicken curry and the bowl was empty. The chicken was tough, dry, and tasteless. No spice to the very thin, watery sauce at all. I was literally done eating within 5 minutes. My wife had $13 Pad Thai and it was very small too.

I was sooo wrong. This place is AMAZING, and most definitely is, the BEST THAI FOOD IN NORTH AMERICA.

There is a caveat though. We went for dinner on Friday night, and that was the night it was the best Thai food ever. Went again on Monday for lunch, and it was only standard\/good Thai food. I don't know if they have different cooks in the kitchen, or if we just ordered the wrong stuff on Monday, but it definitely wasn't as good.

Here are some dishes I'd highly suggest ordering:

-drunken shrimp with noodles underneath -- this was the dish my sister exclaimed she would talk about if she were on the show ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"" haha. enough said?
-green curry
-fried red snapper 
-they had a veggie dish with fried pork belly. the fried pork belly was DELICIOUS.
-fried banana with coconut ice cream and sticky rice -- THIS IS A MUST ORDER!!! Trust.
-thai tea -- It inexplicably tastes fresher and higher quality that thai tea at other places...

This is going to be a regular stop on future Vegas trips for sure. I can't believe it took me this long to discover it! But I'm so glad I did! =)",4,0,4

But the crispy duck was amazing! We got a spice level 3 for the curry and it was a nice subtle heat. Probably could've handled a couple levels hotter but didn't want to push our luck since Thai food tends to be on the spicy side.

We ordered the pad thai (with a special request for tofu) and the red curry with pork, our two go-to Thai dishes that we love. We wanted some veggies, so we split the Thai salad with boiled egg and vegetables (red onion, cucumber, tomato, carrots) topped with crispy wonton strips and the most delicious peanut sauce ever: subtle heat, strong peanut flavor, nice balance of complex flavors. 

Then we had the best pad Thai and red curry we've ever had. They both had nice flavors that didn't depend on loads or salt or sugar, which can be a hard find for Thai food in the U.S. 

The outside of the restaurant looks like a hole in the wall, but the inside is bustling and busy. Celebs from top rated chefs to A-list actors have eaten there (signed photos line the walls), and the chef is a James Beard award winner.

She immediately pointed me in the direction of Lotus of Siam. She said it was an amazing Thai place and that if we had a car we should definitely check it out. I followed her advice and was so happy I did! My husband, who isn't the hugest fan of Thai, and I both enjoyed the meal we had. We ordered more than we could eat (and without having a fridge in our hotel room, we couldn't take any leftovers with us) and we were both very satisfied with our choices.

I will say that I was at first very intimated by the menu. It's more than 10-pages long with a list of your standard curries, in addition to the numerous traditional dishes, plus dishes from different regions of Thailand, add to that a page or more of noodle dishes, salads, appetizers, etc.. - It is enormous! It took us a while, but we finally decided on 3 dishes we had never tried before: Spicy Shrimp Salad, Catfish red curry (without coconut milk), and a Thai-style sausage. We also ordered Pad Thai as sort of a ""control"" dish (something we're both familiar with). They have an huge (and rather impressive) wine list, but neither of us really think about pairing Thai with wine, so we stuck with beer (Singha) instead. 

First, the sausage was delicious. It was a country-style sausage, with big pieces of meat and fat in natural casing, simply seared and served with spears of fresh ginger, a few tiny (but VERY spicy) chili peppers, fresh cabbage, and toasted peanuts. Both of us were really taken by surprised at how flavorful the sausage was. There was a tart\/sour almost citrus-y taste to the meat, like it had been pickled or brined before being chopped\/ground and stuffed into its casing. This actually allowed the sausage to taste less dense than it was (it was a dry sausage, more meat than fat, and the citrus or whatever sour note cut through the meat). Taking a bite of the fresh ginger with a slice of sausage made for a perfect combo. This was, overall, our favorite dish.

The catfish curry was very good, although it was similar to other red curries I've tried. I had never had curry with catfish and the fish was fresh and nicely cooked (not under-cooked and certainly not overcooked). Unfortunately, the zucchini was rather mushy, even though the green beans were al dente. It had a nice heat and the flavor was there. Honestly, this was just OK compared to everything else.

The Spicy Shrimp Salad was surprisingly good and spicy. The shrimp were just this side of cooked, so still a little soft but completely cooked through, and they were huge. They were tossed with a chunky salad dressing of kaffir leaf, fish sauce, soy sauce, basil, chili peppers and probably some tamarind, plus a number of other things I couldn't quite pick out. This was all presented on a bed of roughly chopped Romaine lettuce. I could've done with smaller pieces of lettuce, as they were huge and rib-y compared to the shrimp and dressing. Ultimately, it was very good and something I would have never thought to order. I wish it was served earlier than the other dishes, more like a salad\/appetizer course, rather than the last thing brought to the table.

Lastly, our ""control"" dish of the Pad Thai was a welcome comfort. It was actually the best Pad Thai I've ever had before. The balance of savory, sweet, sour, and salty was perfect. The noodles were cooked well and the add-ins of sprouts, chicken, and peppers were all nicely incorporated. There was a depth of flavor in their Pad Thai that really made the dish stand out from the rest and I really wish I had more room in my stomach to eat more of it.

The price for each of our dishes was comparable to other Thai restaurants at home. I'm surprised at the number of comments by other Yelpers about the portion size. I thought the portions were all easily shared by two people, possibly three. Believe me, neither my husband nor I starved that night! 

The service was fine, not stellar, but we certainly were not ignored or forgotten, despite being seated in the small room just off the main dining room. The decor was shabby, yes, and it definitely could use some TLC. It's at least clean. Situated in a run-down strip mall a few blocks from Las Vegas Blvd., it's as opposite of The Strip as it can be, but the food, I would say, is up there on the same level with the $50\/plate restaurants in the resorts. If we hadn't had other dinner plans during our trip, I would've made another stop here to try more dishes!",1,0,0

Lissa G and I wanted to try out Lotus for quite some time and we finally got a chance to stop by. We went for lunch and arrived shortly after they opened.  The inside is much larger than it looks from the outside. Be sure to get there early or expect a wait. After being seated we ordered some of the recommended dishes.

We asked for all of our dishes to be 7 out of 10 spice level. BTW...not high enough if you like it spicy.

Nam Prik Noom (Green Chili Dip)
The dip was an excellent start and made us excited for the next dishes.  It was the spiciest dish we had and it could be explained as a chucky Thai salsa. The crunchy pork skins and vegies to dip were perfect for the dish, especially if you are trying to stay away from carbs.

Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice)
Ok this dish was pretty addicting. Basically crunchy rice with all the typical great Thai flavors. A must get.

Very excited at this point...
but unfortunately down hill from here.

Garlic Prawns
Very disappointing especially for $24. The ingredient's quality and portion size was well worth the price but the flavor and preparation was lacking. You could tell the oil the prawns were cooked in was not hot enough since they just weren't crispy enough to eat the shells, and we LOVE eating shrimp shells and all. The prawn were also lacking any flavor besides fried prawn.

Panang Beef
Basic dish which was mediocre even compared to our local hole in the wall Thai restaurant we go to locally.  Also, not spicy at all at level 7. Again disappointment.

Sometimes it depends which dishes you get a restaurant and that may me the case for us. You will not have a bad meal here but temper your expectations if you had good Thai elsewhere like in LA or SF.",2,0,0

Garlic Prawns

Crispy Duck with Panang
Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab

Apps- we got the #14 Nam Kao Tod because everyone was raving about it on Yelp. I found it to be small in portion and very very salty. Also they doused it In way too many limes, that's all I could taste. 

Main Courses- my date and I chose to split the Roasted Duck Curry (4\/5 stars - Chada has better duck dishes though)  & Shrimp Pad Thai (4\/5 stars)- can't really mess up pad Thai. 

Dessert - mango sticky rice 5\/5 stars  Yum

The noodles were topped with giant prawns, I think there was 7 or 8. The prawns were huge! And it was deep fried and they separate the shell enough so it is easy to eat the shrimp but still intact enough to make it look like a butterfly. Great presentation. The deep fried shell tastes like shrimp chips, so yummy! The prawns are very tender. There's so much of this stuff that the noodles are dwarfed in comparison. The noodles were also really tasty. It would have been fine if this was a stand alone dish. I don't think I have had drunken noodles this good. The pork curry was also really distinctive. The spices are very rich and unexpected. The pork was tender and flavorful. This is not your typical thai restaurant or typical Americanized thai food. Really great experience. There has been comparisons with this and Kin Khao in SF.

Almost everyone knows about Lotus of Siam since it has been featured on The Best Restaurants of LV and a lot of other food shows. So why not a more stars? i think that there is a lot of hype for this place and I guess I just expected more and better. 

If you go on the weekend, be prepared to wait as there is almost always a crowd here, both locals and out of towners. If you can, make a reservation so you won't wait too long. I've tried a good number of dishes here and they are good, but not spectacular. For some of the dishes, the prices to me are a bit high for Thai food. I've tried the Paid Thai, Pad See Yew, Beef Salad, drunken noodles, the various curries, garlic prawns, and spicy chicken wings. One word of caution - be prepared for the heat - when they ask you how hot you want, dont go overly crazy. I can handle a lot of heat, but their level 5 is hot enough to enjoy.

My girlfriend was a bit skeptical due to its location on an old strip mall. LOL.

As soon as we enter she was impressed with the see through wine cellar and pictures of celebrities and Iron chef Bobby Flay. I also mention the owner\/chef Saipin Chutima was a James Beard Award winning chef. WIth that in mind our expectaction of her Northern style food was high.

We ordered Drunken noodle with seabass and Prawn.  

Drunken Noodle with seabass gets 4 1\/2 stars. The noodle (4stars)  was good, but i was expecting something speciall. On the other hand the Seabass was 5 stars. It was crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth fresh in the middle. WOW it was soo good. 

Prawn (5 Stars)  This is something special that you don't find anywhere else. Its skin was split away from its meat. Which both were cooked in perfection. I took a bite of the meat first and then ate the skin which were so soft and crunchy. Its texture mirrors a crispy potato chip. This was a perfect dish!! 

There many good Thai restaurants here in LA. I have never taste anything as good as Lotus' Seabass and Prawn here in LA.",3,1,2

Our server suggested the Drunken Noodle Prawns and we also ordered Pad Prik King chicken. Both were outstanding. Our server was friendly and attentive and the restaurant was very clean. We had a wonderful Italian red wine with our meal that made it absolutely perfect.

We went at noon for the lunch buffet. I had no idea that this place was smack dab in the middle of the ghetto. It is in a run down (understatement) strip mall and the inside isn't much better. We were seated in the room with the basement windows. 

The buffet was the smallest I've ever seen - there were two chicken options, two soups, 2 noodle dishes and some vegetarian options. I tried a little bit of everything, but the only thing that stood out was the noodle soup. The orange chicken had an overpowering fake orange flavor and the pad thai was not good, nor were the egg rolls. That's too bad. 

My friend ordered the drunken noodles, and they were good. Maybe ordering from their entree menu would have been a better decision? We split a bowl of coconut ice cream and I grabbed a few deep fried bananas off of the bar - the ice cream was super delicious, but the bananas were just okay.

Then I taught myself how to make it and decided the rubbery squid and the average curries were not worth the trip to Commercial Center.

I came back recently and had an interesting dish, soft shell crab drunken noodle, a bit on the pricey side - the crab itself was tasty, with the spicy level appropriate (7\/10), basil and mint.  The drunken noodle was a bunch of clumped-together wide noodles, so I should have ordered the soft shell crab salad (cabbage, lime dressing, peanuts) instead - I am a big fan of the Vietnamese soft shell crab salad with watercress (cua lot chien bo, a fave of mine at Vietopia in Houston).

This time we also tried the Tom Kha Kai, and it wasn't as memorable, just a limey coconut-y soup, which I now can make equally as good if not better...the Thai tea was great, the SERVICE was outstanding during the meal except we never got the spicy condiments we asked for and then all waitstaff disappeared and we had to ask the owner or manager for the check.

The renovation and expansion is certainly an inviting factor - the atmosphere is nice.  Also, Mayor Goodman was dining there, and he turned on his way out the door and waved to our section, and we all waved and cooed, ""Bye Mayor!""

Value for your dollar is a big fat 1 star. Maybe I hyped it up too much in my head because of all the rave reviews and also the long line waiting outside even before the restaurant opened.

We got basically most of the popular items.
Drunken noodles with sea bass, we asked for level 7 spicy and it had a good kick and the sea bass was very moist and tender with it. However, for almost an $30 dish, it was not very much  noodles and just barely enough fish for our group of 4 to split.
Crispy Duck Kha Soi (Sp?), this was a creamy coconut based sauce with egg noodles and crispy duck. I have to say, the duck was perfectly cooked and delicious, the noodles was good too, especially coated in the sauce. Again for the price of $25 it was barely enough noodles to split between 4 people.
The fried shrimp everyone seemed to get. I do love how crispy the shells are, completely edible and full of shrimp flavor. It looks like a big plate of 10+ shrimp, but it's more like actual shrimp meat is 4-5 pieces and the rest of just shell. 
The spicy chicken wings were just OK, tastes like Costco wings tossed in the Asian sweet chili sauce, would skip next time.
We got the red chili dip, it was very smokey but that was about the only flavor it really had, not a fan of this one either.
Ordered a curry dish, it didn't have coconut milk and was another one lacking in flavor, didn't finish this dish because it just didn't taste like anything, just a lot of boiled veggies in a red watery soup. 

You'd think after 6 dishes between 4 people we'd be full but ended up having to order another drunken noodle dish but this one with just veggies. Sadly this second round was not as good as the first one with sea bass. We also go their mango sticky rice for dessert.

Overall, some of the dishes were very good but not good enough to justify the price.",3,1,0

Food
- best authentic Thai food you will ever experience.  The depth of their menu is impressive.  The food is amaze balls
- Khao Soi with braised beef:  crunchy noodles & soft yellow egg noodles in a curry sauce is a great texture juxtaposition. the braise beef so soft it's to die for.  
- Tom Kha Kai soup:  medley of hot sour and coconut soup served piping hot with soft chicken slices.  Very good broth.  Can't go wrong with this dish IMHO
- Druken noodles fried duck- small portions for $27 Greasy don't know why so much hype over this dish.
Tip:  Thai ice tea average
 
Parking:  big lot it's free.  Most taxis know how to get here.

Food: 5

Tom Yum Noodle Soup: This was hands down the best version that we've ever had. The most important part is the broth, and they nailed it. The broth was flavorful but perfectly balanced. Their spiciness levels range from 1 to 10. We chose 5, and it was just mildly spicy. Spice wimps like me will feel some heat, but you might want to choose a higher number if you want spicy food as my mom didn't even realize it was spicy.

Pad See Ew with Chicken: This was a-okay. The chicken was well cooked, but the noodles lacked the char that I usually want in this dish. The portion is a tad small for the price.

Crab Fried Rice: I told my mom that this fried rice was better than hers, and that's high praise. Fried rice usually entails rice that does not clump or stick together. The individual grains of rice must be separate, but that usually causes it to taste a little dry. Somehow, they've managed to make fried rice that is fluffy and soft but separate. The egg is also perfectly cooked so that it's fluffy and moist. There is also plenty of crab.

Note: There food does lean towards the saltier side, but I don't mind.

Service: 4.5

The wait staff is polite and patient when you're ordering. I like that our waiter didn't hover over us throughout the entire meal yet he still managed to ensure that our water glasses were never empty. However, it is a little hard to flag someone down if you need something because they're so busy.

Ambiance: 4.5

The restaurant is deceivingly large, but it somehow manages to procure a wait list. Don't fret over the waitlist!

In Asian literature, lotuses serve as a motif to symbolize inner beauty, because lotuses em emerge as elegant flowers amidst mundane lily pads in muddy waters. Lotus of Siam epitomizes this as an unpretentious restaurant serving Thai food so earth-shattering, it is as if a pack of elephants has trampled through your prior memories of pad Thai and tom yum.

Lotus of Siam was unearthed when a friend heard about it on an Anthony Bourdain show, and it was placed on the Vegas food list. Although the wait is notorious, we got there a little after 9pm and it was only a 10-minute wait, during which we perused the extensive menu (and it still took quite some time to decide once seated; the pages of Thai delicacies were endless!). The catch for the last seating is that the kitchen was taking last orders, so there was no chance to add anything. We decided to err on the side of ordering too much, and it was the best decision we made on the entire Vegas trip.

(+++) GARLIC PRAWNS (deep fried prawns with shells, almost like potato chips, sautéed with our special garlic sauce, topped with ground black pepper) Almost like potato chips. Love that description! The hype cannot be more real, and you likely won't be able to eat shrimp the same way again. The shrimp itself was fresh and succulent, and the highlight was the shell which was deliciously umami with a kick from the pepper and garlic. I devoured it even though I usually detest shrimp shells (hurray, finally I get my glucosamine). 

(+++) TOM KAH KAI (Bangkok Style; a distinctive soup of sliced chicken with coconut milk, straw mushrooms, galanga, lemon grass and a touch of lime juice) The spices and seasonings render a tantalizing complexity, bold and adventurous like an adventure to Thai street food, yet simultaneously unique and meticulous like a long-standing family recipe. I especially liked the touch of coconut milk, making it indulgent but not too creamy. Probably one of the more under-rated dishes as the garlic prawns steal the spotlight. As a bonus, this is served in a pot with an open flame, which looks exotic and neat in pictures (but the shape made it difficult to scoop the soup towards the end... when we were all craving more sopu)

(++) KHAO SOI (typical Burmese influenced dish, served with egg noodles in a curry base with a touch of coconut cream, garnished with sliced red onions, lime and pickled vegetables) We decided to get the beef version since the famous duck khao soi was quite a lot pricier. Like the rest of the dishes, the flavors were untamed with rich curry paired with coconut cream, contrasted by lime and pickled vegetables. The noodles were soft and mild, quiescent in juxtaposition with the fiery broth, and the wonton crisps added a playful garnish. Beef was okay, nothing special (thankfully so since I'm running out of my repertoire of food description words)

(++) PAD THAI (stir-fried thin rice noodles with eggs, green onions, bean sprouts and chopped peanuts on the side) Homey and more familiar, though still noticeably different from your typical pad Thai. Their version was not greasy and very well balanced, at the intersection of aromatic, spicy, and savory. We took the rest to-go and enjoyed heavenly leftovers two days later as our last meal in Vegas (even after our palates had been spoiled by Bacchanal).

It totaled $81 for 3 people, which is considerably more expensive than your typical Thai joint but a completely different level. The Northern Thai style is distinctive, made even more so by the chef's style. According to the website, she utilizes what has been passed down in generations. Lotus of Siam has no neon lights or Corinthian columns and is unimpressively located in a strip mall, but the food speaks for itself--flawless in technique, exotic in flavor profile, and interpretative in embedding the culinary tradition of the chef's roots.",6,1,4

I don't think it's so much that the staff is lazy or disinterested. It's just that it's hard to stay motivated to cook aggressively and ambitiously when the clientele isn't aggressive or ambitious in its ordering and dietary habits. This fault isn't particular to ethnic restaurants: most high-end restaurants succumb to the same pattern of early greatness followed by plateau and then slow, steady decline (if they ever reach the heights to begin with).

To be fair, the food was very good. It was not extraordinary or even top 10%. Fresh mushroom salad was an interesting idea, half-realized. The two shrimp that accompanied the salad were fine, but not of the same quality as at a much more unprepossessing restaurant I visited two nights later. The salad itself was a bit monochromatic.

I did enjoy a dry beef liver entree, though it was not nearly as spicy as my server averred. He helpfully provided some condiments and recommendations. 

My server, in fact, helped me to my conclusion that LoS wasn't terrific. I'd gone to LoS expecting that it would be overrated. But I don't like to prejudge. My server was more enthusiastic in recommending other Thai restaurants than he was in talking about his own menu.

The area its located in seems sketchy. It's like the scene of a drug deal in a movie outside a billiards bar. With everything looking closed, I wasn't even sure the restaurant was open if it wasn't for a few anonymous black jacketed patrons hanging outside of their door. As soon as I parked and got out of the car, I got hit up by a random stranger on a bicycle if he can clean my car for money. I said no thanks and rushed my family to the restaurant.

It gets better inside after seeing warmth and kind faces. At first glance the restaurant looks rather confined, like a San Francisco or New York restaurant that struggles with optimizing its square footage. Little did I know, there's a backroom and getting there felt like the infamous Goodfellas scene, walking through corridors and into a whole other adventure.

Food wise I ordered the house special fried rice, the tom kha gai, chop suey, and the garlic prawns based on other yelpers' thoughts.

All money. For sure the Garlic Prawns is a must. For me I loved the house special friend rice a lot because they did tomato fried rice with justice. It's surprisingly on the oily side so not everyone in my family enjoyed it like I did. Chop suey was also done right and if it wasn't for the price, I would order it over any other restaurant's.

The first time I came to this place was when I drove in on a Friday night around 8pm. We strolled in and they said the wait was going to be about an hour and some change so we bailed out. This time around, I played it safe and made reservations again for a Friday night at 6:30 pm. We were seated within a few minutes upon arrival. At that very moment the restaurant was half full so technically I didn't really need the reservations. As time progressed, the restaurant got crowded quite swiftly.

There are numerous friendly servers here which is great, plenty of help. You'll always have people walking around, which you can flag down at any time. It did however took some time to get the food out. We would get half our order then there would be a period of silence. Other servers would approach us and think we were waiting for the check when we were actually waiting for the rest of our food.

As for the food here, the menu is practically endless. You'll find all your typical dishes you would find in any Thai restaurant, there's some pricey specialties aka chef's recommendations at the back of the menu. However, I think there best deal are their authentic and different Thai regional dishes. Growing up eating Thai food practically everyday, I stayed clear from all your everyday Pad Thais and of the sort.

We started off with the Tom Yum Pla Dook aka Tom Yum catfish soup. I had all my dishes made with three stars (1-10 spiciness star rating) just to keep it safe. Three stars wasn't spicy, a tingling feel but it won't make your toes curl yet. You can always add more chili if you ask for the condiments. Great soup starter and perfect hangover remedy. Tanginess and some spiciness is ideal after a night of boozing.

Nam Khoa Tod - appetizer style dish where they fry the rice along with some other herbal type ingredients. Another authentic Thai dish that many restaurant choose not not to carry (don't ask why I don't know). Overall not too shabby, I'd order it again.

Moo Yaang aka marinated grilled pork. It's really hard to mess this one up. The sauce that accompanies this dish could've used some help though. I'm use to a stronger sauce taste and it was a little bland for my taste buds. BTW, sticky rice (extra $2) is great with this dish but I think they give you a bowl of steam rice instead.

Neua Naam Thok, direct translation: beef waterfall. You know how sometimes beef has a distinct taste to it? Well this one had it. I couldn't stomach more than half. Probably the weakest link that I ordered.

The portions here aren't too big. Four orders for two people may sound like a lot but we were able to eat at least 80% into it. For Las Vegas, this place isn't bad at all and I would like to come back to try some more of their authentic selection. I'm not going to lie, it's not the BEST THAI FOOD ever but it's up to par for Vegas standards and who they're truly trying to cater to. Remember to make that reservation beforehand and play it safe.

Dinner for 2: $50ish.",4,0,1

The reason for only 3 stars has to do with how they run the business (see last paragraph).  I've eaten Thai food all over the country - California, Oregon, Colorado, New York, Florida, etc and this by far is the best Thai food I have ever tasted.

Favorite dishes are of course the Chicken Pad Thai, Rad Na, and a soup I had with coconut milk, veggies, mushrooms, shrimp (forgot the name).  I ordered a beef type of salad last time and it was so fresh.  Love the little cucumber salad that is served with the Chicken Satay appetizers.  Thai BBQ chicken was very good - and the sweet and sour sauce that homes with it is homemade and delicious.

Get there as early as possible as there is always a wait.  You can make reservations, but not for the same day and they will only hold your table for 5 minutes so be on time.

My complaint is they should have some kind of voicemail that has their hours and not just let their phone ring and ring for people to guess.  I've also called during business hours and their phone isn't being answered (I'll call back several times and it just rings and rings).

Don't judge this place by it's cover - the outside looks pretty ghetto - the inside is MUCH better.

After reading through some reviews, we ended up ordering:
1)Tom Kah Kai - A distinctive soup of sliced chicken with coconut milk, straw mushroom galanga, lemon grass and a touch of lime juice. $4.95 for a cup - it was good, not the BEST I've had, but pretty comparable to other Thai restaurants. 
2)Nam Kao Tod -Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. - $7.95 : this had a lot of flavor, actually TOO much flavor. It was pretty salty. The first few bites were really good, after that, the flavor kicked in and it was hard to eat. Unique dish though, never had it before.
3) Drunken Noodles with Crispy Duck - Crispy duck topped with homemade fresh chili and Thai basil. Serve on the top of pan fried flat rice noodle. - $21.95 : this dish was GOOD, it could have used more noodles though - they gave us enough for one person, hardly enough for 2 people to share. Most people want more meat - and here we wanted more noodles, they gave us a good amount of crispy duck though. The flavors blended together perfectly. Would def. recommend this dish. 
4) Thai Iced tea - $2.50 each : the tea taste was stronger than any other Thai tea I've had - so if you're really into tea - that's a good thing. I'm not into that strong taste so I handed it over to my bf.

Dinner came out to be $42 exactly before tip. So if you get these dishes, expect to spend about $50. and that's with no dessert. =(

The best Thai restaurant in North America? I have to disagree. It's ok, but definitely not the best. I guess that's what happens when places are hyped - you expect too much. If you come here not expecting much, maybe it will live up to the hype. Sorry ya'll.",1,1,1

The Pad Thai was pretty good.  They have a huge extensive menu, it may take you a while to figure out what you want.  

The Won Ton and Vegetable soup (Hot n sour it claimed) were nothing to write about, very bland, and they pretty much tasted the same, only difference was the won tons, but if you look at the menu they look like two different things.

No kids menus of any sort.

This is just your basic thai place, not really sure what all the hype was about.

I would give it 3 1\/2 stars, I almost would bump it to four because I love there check-in technology, you can take a ride around the strip mall or walk around if you so please and get notified via text message.  You can also see where you are on there list from your phone.

Since I frequently deliver from this restaurant, I had high expectations from the start. The service is always quick and the turnaround is amazing especially since it is always packed.

Be weary of the incredibly long wait that you will most likely encounter when you arrive at the restaurant - I arrived an hour before they closed and I still had to wait 30-45 minutes before I could get a table! However, they send you a text to see a list of other people who are also waiting so that you can leave and come back once the table is ready. There's also a bar where those who are 21+ can wait -- with their wine cellar who can resist?! (I had to drive, so I had to.)

Here's what I had:

Beef pad thai (4\/5) \/\/ I wasn't expecting the portion to be as small as it was since I'm so used to Thai restaurants giving a hefty load when it comes to pad thai; however, the quality of the food was top notch and the noodles were thinner than what I'm used to. Usually I can never finish portions of pad thai, but this was just enough to fill up my belly!

Mango sticky rice (4\/5) \/\/ I felt like the mango sticky rice was a little overpriced for the portion they give, but nevertheless the mango was just as sweet as I expected it to be.

Although Lotus is so famous, it didn't really blow me away. Maybe it's because I had such high expectations or maybe it's because I've gone to numerous other Thai restaurants that delivered a better price to portion ratio... but nevertheless for my experience I can't say that it's the best, but the Pad Thai was pretty scrumptious.",4,2,2

 It's a nice change to have employees seem to genuinely care about what you're feeling like, and then help you pick out your dishes, explaining the menu to you.

I can't eat shrimp, but everyone else at my table LOVED the shrimp dish they got, so if you like shrimp, definitely try it!  (it was called Garlic Prawns)

And they made an off-the-menu dessert combo for us because we couldn't decide what to choose--so sweet!  The fried banana was delicious, and the perfect end to a fantastic and super-filling meal.

First of, you wouldn't expect to find a great place for food in the run-down ""mini-mall"" that it is located in. One advice, go there during ""lit hours"" if you are by yourself.  Luckily, it's still light out after 7pm.  

We walked in at 7pm on a Thursday night without reservations and the place was pretty full.  At first the guy told us it would be at least a 30 minute wait but then said that he could seat us if we didn't take more than 1 hour. Since it was just the 2 of us, we said of course! I would recommend reservation esp if you have a big party.  It looks like they had a separate section for a bigger party (maybe 20+) but the biggest table I saw sat 12 people comfortably.  

The food was excellent!  We skipped the appetizer and went straight for the meal. We had the green papaya salad, drunken seafood noodles, and red curry with chicken.  We asked for everything mild and It was ""just right, a little sweat and tears"" spicy.  It came with a side of jasmine rice but we had 1 order of sticky rice esp for the curry! Yum!  The portions weren't huge but between the both of us, we ate pretty much everything.  Now, we could've been done without desert but the table next to us ordered a whole bunch and we couldn't resist!  So, we had shared 2 of them: fresh sliced mango with sticky rice topped with a light cream sauce AND coconut ice cream. Oooooh, so yummy!  Yes, we finished that without a problem.

The service was good.  We had a bunch of people helping us and our water glass was never empty.  Thank goodness with all the spicy-ness!  The one thing I thought was strange was that after we got our food, no one came by to ask us how things were until we were almost done eating everything. Then again, maybe that's probably why huh? They probably didn't want to interrupt the ""shoveling"" of food! Ha!

-Got the ""khao soi with braised beef"" (the beef fell apart and was so tender)

-Got ""nam prik ong"" which was great and kinda reminded me of a thick meaty and more flavorful bolognese sauce 

-Got the ""crispy duck panang"" (amazing)

-Got the ""Sai Oua"" (thai sausage) very tasty

Overall I was very impressed and satisfied. Would eat here rather than the buffets. There's alot to choose from and the prices are worth it. I'd definitely go back here on my next trip to Vegas. I wish they delivered all the way to Toronto Canada lol",0,0,0

We did a toast to each course because we could not stop talking about the food!

It was TOTALLY worth the two hour wait to be seated and the two years it took me to get there. While waiting, many of the regulars (many who come in from out of town) advised us what to order and we looked at the extensive 15 page menu.

Tom Kah Kai soup was exquisite. The first thing that hits you is the great aroma. It had layers of flavors-sweet, salty, with a taste of lime and coconut all with a bit of spice throughout. The white meat chicken was thinly sliced and tender and mushrooms that were firm but not overcooked.

Woon Sen soup (Bankok style) was delicious. The first thing noticed was how it was seasoned with the right amount of salt. The Napa cabbage was cooked perfectly, crunchy but not raw as were the cellophane noodles. The black mushrooms and chicken only enhanced it.

The garlic prawns is one of the most popular items on the menu. Now, I know why. The prawns are deep fried with the shell on and topped with black pepper, having a potato chip texture with a bite. Then, there's the garlic that tasted like it was infused throughout each prawn. This is something that I'd definitely order again.

Crispy duck on drunken noodles was the favorite dish ordered. I was surprised at how crispy the duck actually was, being that it was covered by the sauce of the noodles. The meat itself was moist and flavorful and not greasy like most duck I've ordered from other restaurants in the past. It was placed on a bed of flat noodles that was swimming and over saturated in a sauce, hence the name drunken. The sauce was salty with a sweet and sour aspect in it and a mild spiciness.

This restaurant does not skimp on flavors. EVERYTHING is bursting with lots and lots of flavors.

Now I can take some heat; I can take jalapeños no prob and even little bits of habanero in my sushi. But the mild level of spiciness of Lotus of Siam's soup is a bit much for me especially after the chili sits in the soup for a while. So order at your own risk!

Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage is one of the popular dishes mentioned here on Yelp and it deserved the reputation. Like I said, BURSTING with flavors.

The crispy duck with chu-chee was delicious!  Now I had no idea what chu-chee is, but the crispy duck came out in a red curry. Both the duck and the curry was very good. My only complaint is the price tag of $20 for a few pieces of duck and not very much sauce. It was good though!

If you took a cab to Lotus of Siam, be sure to ask the cab driver for a card\/phone # and call for a cab to pick you up when you get the check.

I could handle spicy more than most people... well, I was dead wrong.  It was damn spicy!  So if you go here and they ask you for the scale... order 4!  Otherwise it's way too spicy.  I don't know if it was able to take less spicy this time because of the heat in Vegas... not sure if that had something to do with it.  But it was damn spicy.  Their deep fried pompano fish was pretty tasty as well.  Their sticky rice with mango was also very tasty.  The mango was very good.

Knowing that this place gets pretty busy during dinner time, one friend suggested that I call in to make a reservation.  I called and staff said all reservations were full, but walk-ins were welcome.  Okay, no reservation.  So either we go in for an early dinner (before 5:30) or a late dinner (after 7:30).  We decided on the late dinner.  And yeah, we ended up eating pretty late.  We got to the restaurant at 9:30, half an hour before it close.

We waited for about 5 minutes before we got seated.  We got to sit at a bigger table so there's plenty of room.  The staffs were friendly and efficient.  Our food orders came out quickly.  

fried tofu (bean curd) -- nicely fried tofu with cabbage strips on the bottom and a side of plum sauce.  The tofu was crispy on the outside and silky on the inside.  I like it a lot.  

roasted duck curry -- the flavor was good.  You get pieces of roasted duck with pineapple pieces and the usual veggies.  Not too spicy.  Good for people who like some heat but don't want to start sweating from it.   But for people who like extra spicy food or who wants to sweat, I think you can probably ask them to make it more spicy.  Entree comes with a side of rice.    

garlic shrimp -- jumbo plump shrimps deep fried with the shell on.  The shrimps were butterflied before frying so it's so crispy that you can actually eat the shell .  The flavor was on point.  If you like you can dip it in plum sauce, but there's enough flavor where you didn't have to.  I enjoyed this dish.

pad se eww -- Nice flavor, well cooked, and not overly greasy.  The flat noodle was cooked just right so that it's not dry.  The noodle did not stick together.  The vegetable was tender.  Liked it.

I'm not the biggest Thai food fan,  but I know what I like, and I LOVED this. Everything tasted incredible. We ordered the sum thom salad, which was generously vinegary, and a steaming bowl of tom khai coconut soup, level 7, which was a deeply revelatory experience to everyone at the table. Two of my party even declared pre-soup that they hate coconut-based concoctions, but after trying one spoonful they were ladling it out right fast. We found level 7 to be satisfyingly spicy without being bland. For an entree I ordered the pork panang curry, level 7. Delicious. Not the best in the world, and the pork was a little bland, but it was oddly comforting food. I would have preferred it a little spicier, but I suspect they think white ladies are lying when they ask for hot and spicy food. Girl I am not lying: I like my spicy! For drinks we ordered a flight of Riesling, which perfectly complemented the food. This is a must purchase for any spicy meal.

I actually met the daughter of the owners and she's been trying to get me to eat here for about a year...  I haven't been able to make it back in town for leisure but I finally ended up back in town for business the week of SEMA 2009 (Nov 1-8).

After a bit of convincing, we took an entire business dinner here with over 20 people.  Even though we were strange foreigners to the area, we all managed to find it in the dark parking lot of horrors that lured us in away from the shiny flashy neon lights of Vegas. Our dinner party consisted of foodies and hungry men from CA, OK, and Taiwan, and China.

The menu had what seems like hundreds of various options that I've never even seen on a Thai menu.  Normally I'd just expect Pad Thai, Rad Naa, Pad See Ew and some seafood fried rice, but the menu here was so vast and covered everything from Chilean Sea Bass, to short ribs, beef salads, curries, rices, fried Prawns and the traditional Pad Thai. The 23 of us managed to order almost 30 dishes and we all had the intention of eating individually but we ended up eating family style because we all reacted with the same ""OMG, you MUST try this, it's too good!"" reactions.

There were soo many dishes ordered that I'm not even going to waste my time trying to list everything out.  Personally, I ordered the Sea Bass w\/ Suki sauce and I also managed to try the traditional curries w\/ rice, and noodles.  I also bummed someone's beef short ribs and a wonderful sampling of Tom Yum soup.  Seriously, the food was so amazing that we all just shared and the ""business meeting"" ended up turning into a friendly feast.

The experience was so amazing that I brought a 2nd business dinner there two nights later.  The same exact thing happened as the first too! We ened up eating like a hungry family and no one left unhappy.

Seriously, this is beyond me saying ""some of the best Thai food I've ever had"".  It actually is more like ""some of the best food I've ever had PERIOD"".  Not only is the food here so amazing that it's worth sharing, it's brought some of my most memorable and happiest dining experiences as a group.  

I still get calls from the clients in Oklahoma and reps from Taiwan who say they want to go back. 

Yes. It's that darn good.

I waited like, 2 hours for dinner on a Friday night. Yelp is crazy for this place. My friends are crazy for this place. My DENTIST is crazy for this place. So I thought the 2 hour wait must mean that it's okay to join the craziness.

But it's really just mediocre Thai food dressed up nicely in a terrible restaurant setting. Really, the atmosphere is kindof like a typical Chinese restaurant - sub-par service, dirty tablecloths, wobbly tables, a little noisy so you-can-but-not-really-hear-each-other-talk, etc.

Maybe the trick is that they sell wine, which is nice. So people eating here get drunk enough they can't remember they just spent like $30 on 6 pieces of tiny shrimp. Seriously, Vegas grocery stores have the biggest shrimp for so cheap. I'm not sure where this place is sourcing their ingredients from unless they're just sitting on like, 80% profit margins. Everybody recommends the Garlic Prawn dish. The taste is *fine* but I think that's a rip off if I ever saw one.

Also got the duck panang. It was good...it's just...I mean, you're paying $30 for such a small dish. 

Is it me? Am I just a pig who eats more than she should? Because I just don't understand how these are good deals for people living in Vegas???? Or are they single-people portions and I'm misunderstanding because the setting is so...common? Honestly, when I pay $30 at a restaurant for a single dish, I either expect it to be super large OR super extraordinary OR at least have a super comfortable atmosphere.

The garlic prawns were consistently good both times. The khao soi was much better during our first visit, with beef, versus the second time, with duck. We also tried the beef drunken noodles, nam kao tod, nam prik ong and beef pad se ew, but none of these were nearly as good as the garlic prawns and khao soi. Since they do take-out, we're tempted to just pick up the garlic prawns from this place and then stopping by to get the Peking duck bao, short rib grilled cheese and sesame noodles from nearby Fat Choy, if we venture to this portion of Las Vegas.

The garlic prawns are the best thing here. The meat of the prawn is almost entirely removed from the shell so that it is only attached to the shell at the tail. The entire prawn, shell and all, is then deep fried perfectly. The meat remains tender but the shell becomes the best shrimp chip you have ever had. The garlic prawns are great by themselves and seasoned very well, but the garlic sauce that they add on top make the prawns even better. There is an added bit of sweetness in the garlic sauce that is perfect.

The khao soi is essentially a coconut curry noodle dish. The first time we got it, we chose beef as the meat. We were initially hesitant about squeezing in the accompanying lime, but the waiter was kind enough to recommend that we try it that way. We were right to listen. The added acidity from the lime juice made the sweet, fatty coconut curry even better. The second time, we decided to try the crispy duck khao soi. Alas, the coconut curry was a bit off this time. It didn't have the initial wow that we experienced during the first trip here, even after squeezing in the lime juice. In addition, the amount of curry and noodles was also smaller than the beef khao soi. The duck was cooked well with a crispy skin, but the reason you are here is for the khao soi.

The other items we tried here were less successful. The drunken noodle (pad kee mao elsewhere) were very pedestrian and nowhere as good as the drunken noodles we have had in Los Angeles. Similarly, the pad se ew was also lackluster. It tasted like pad se ew, but it wasn't the best pad se ew you've ever had. The nam prik ong was also a bit disappointing. In essence, this is a tomato paste served with crudité and fried pork skin. There was nothing about the sauce that made it memorable, being just a tomato paste. The nam kao tod is crispy rice mixed with sausage, cilantro, lime juice, peanut and chilis. From the description, again, I would have expected something very bright and complex, but it was again fairly plain.

We would come back or just do take out for the garlic prawns and maybe the khao soi (but not the crispy duck version of it). Better yet, we would probably just pick up the garlic prawns here and then head over somewhere else to complete the meal.",0,0,0

It was about 8:30PM when I rolled up to this place. My first thought was, ""Wow, this parking lot is sketchy looking."" There are hardly any street lights. When I parked, I parked next to some Audi that had its front end smashed in and 4 flat tires. Then while walking to the entrance of the restaurant, some very sketchy-looking white male on a bicycle started to make up some story about ""his wife"" then asked for money. We just kept walking because who knows what kind of bicycle shenanigans he might pull off. We put our names down on the decent sized waiting list, went back outside, and moved my car just to get some piece of mind in the dodgy parking lot. It seemed like no one hung around outside of the restaurant which added onto the sketchiness. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for 2 people.

The food was delicious with lots of flavor and textures. We pretty much only ordered from the chef's specialty section:
1) drunken noodle with soft shell crab
2) deep fried garlic prawns
3) nam kao tod

All the food was a little spicy yet yummy. Again, it was my last Vegas thing of the day before heading 3 hours west and I was already awake for a long time gambling and such so I was almost falling asleep in here. Maybe my review would be different if I had more energy or was drinking.

With accolades like that, I tend to have high expectations.... Expectations that were not met.

When you arrive at Lotus of Siam, it looks just like every other Thai restaurant found in any old town. It appears to be made up of several converted spaces that makes it feel like a Bingo hall. There are water damage stains on the ceiling where crystal chandeliers from the early 80's hang under fluorescent lights. Dusty framed pieces of art depicting elephants drawn with sequins adorn the walls. It really couldn't be any more of a cliche. Then there was the menu. Inundated with over 150 items, I was enormously overwhelmed by the task at hand. Luckily, the website lists a number of recommendations within each course. So we went with the Koong Sarong or ""Prawn in Blanket."" This dish featured marinated prawns wrapped with bacon and wonton wraps, deep fried, and served with homemade sweet and sour sauce. Was it good? Of course! It was amazing! But what isn't when wrapped in bacon and deep fried. The prawns were done just right and the sauce balanced out the heaviness of the wonton nicely.

They say that the true test of a brilliant chef is to order the simplest menu item and see how they are able to make it their own. It seemed like a reasonable challenge, but not so much that night. I went with my old standby Pad Thai and couldn't wait to see what Chef Saipin Chutima would do. Unfortunately, I was sadly underwhelmed. The dish tasted okay, but I had seen this dozens of times before. It was by no means a revelation. In fact, it was overly oily and too sweet. My companions ordered Charbroiled Beef which was very grisly, and while the Sweet and Sour Chicken was nice and fresh, the use of cilantro was overpowering and just too much. It could very well be that we just did not order the right menu items. But in my opinion, any item coming out of such a heralded kitchen should be cooked to perfection. 

My advice: save up and splurge at a ""Strip"" restaurant such as Shibuya at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino. It will cost a bit more but the experience will be worth it. My lesson learned: every dining experience and plate is different. Critically acclaimed restaurants do not always deliver as you would like them to.",0,0,0

Well, it had the misfortune of 1) being the dinner we ate AFTER having gone to Jose Andres' e' and 2) being visited a few months AFTER the wife and I had eaten in Portland's Pok Pok.

If it weren't for those two things, this would've been a five star review all the way. But alas, it wasn't the best meal I'd eaten in 24 hours (though, yes, an unfair comparison) let alone the best Thai I'd had (by which I mean the aforementioned Pok Pok.)

So let me stop the comparisons and just talk about our experience. It's in a strip mall--a sketch strip mall at that. Some (my overly critical parents, for example) might find that a turn off. Others (a-hole Yelpers like me for example) add points given a genuine hole-in-the-wall status. Thankfully, the sketch doesn't extend to the interior.

We had a group of six. We'd made reservations about a month previous so we had few (if any) hiccups (though we did heed the advice of showing up exactly on time.) The wine list was impressive by hole-in-the-wall Thai joint standards. Actually, it wasn't bad from an objective standpoint either. We'd ordered a few bottles of Reisling, letting the sweetness of the wine counter the spiciness of the food and allowing each diner to bathe in the unfettered air of foodie douchebaggery.

I ordered the BBQ Pork (Moo Yang). It was tasty and I was pretty pleased with it, though it was kind of one-note. Also, it reminded me of the pork I'd eaten at Tu Lan's, a shady Vietnamese place in SF. Now that's not a bad comparison since I LOVED that pork, but I'd expected something a bit more...Thai.

My wife ordered a green curry dish. She said it was ""okay,"" and indeed, my sampling of it concurred. She groused, though. ""From the reputation of this place, I was expecting to be blown away."" Yeah, I guess so. Then again, some places shine with their unexpected dishes--their specials and such--while phoning it in on the same ol', same ol'. I guess this could be one of those places. In fact, I hope so. It's really hard to tell since the majority of our group went the ""5 different varieties of curry"" route and they too were mildly disappointed.

Sigh.

The service was good and friendly. My pork was tasty. The wine flowed easily. But most of my group were perplexed and questioned the LoS's reputation. I don't know, man. Why didn't you guys order the whole fish if you wanted to see what they can do?

I enjoyed other places' versions better (eeep).  Although their prices are cheap, very reasonable.

I guess what really sets this place apart is its impressively extensive wine list.  From a humble entrance with waiting times lasting up to 2 hours, you are greeted by a large cellar filled with wine from around the world.  I'm not sure how these pair perfectly with Thai cuisine but I'm thinking any wine aficionado will enjoy this visit.  So go for the lobster, sea bass and German wine.  Otherwise, you can always get seated immediately at the numerous Thai options in Vegas.

I was somewhat relieved once inside LOS, although wasn't sure what to expect given that there wasn't anything too special about what was inside.
Anyway, all that really matters is that the food is amazing.  I eat a lot of Thai food and generally find it hard for a restaurant to do it really poorly or really well, and LOS managed to impress me.  Her specialty is Northern Thai dishes, so be sure to try something you may not be accustomed to if you're used to Bangkok Thai food, like I am.  The best part of all is that the food is incredibly reasonably priced.
Also the first thai restaurant I've been to with a wine list (though small)!
Be sure to check out the pictures on the wall of all the celebrities that have been patrons (including many famous chefs)!
As mentioned in the other reviews, reservations are key.  This place is often booked up days in advance.
I give it 5 stars for terrific value, superb Thai cuisine, and for being a refreshing break from the over-the-top glitz (and price) of the strip.",0,0,1

It's located in an economically--and otherwise--depressed strip mall. (There's a bedraggled ""Adult Day Care"" two doors down with a flickering, half-lit neon sign. Love you, mom and dad.) I'm not complaining about that, though. In my experience if a local tells you that something's the best and it's in a terrible location, you're usually in for a real treat. So I was actually getting more excited. 

A few of our party were under 5 minutes late and the staff acted like they were doing us a favor by seating us. They were very busy, but we *did* have reservations. 

When the waiter came by, he was very much in a hurry. As a NYer, I don't generally have a problem with that, but I rarely see a waiter rush like that, with no effort to be hospitable at all. The guy who filled our waters was far more personable and helpful. 

I ordered the Massaman Curry, which is a standard\/classic dish. When I got it it wasn't hot, but warm verging on room temperature and it sat there cooling more as we waited several minutes for the rice to arrive. When I tasted it, the flavors were great, but there was no spice at all. The waiter didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it and I didn't ask because usually at a Thai place, they just give you 'medium spice for an American' if you don't specify. 

The prices were very decent and more inline with their location than their apparent popularity, which is good.

While the curries and other standards at Lotus are wonderful, I am sure, this is a special Thai restaurant that offers so much more, so do venture outside the usuals. Definitely an emphasis on fresh seafood here... And their Northern dishes really stand out as well.

Koong Sarong (prawn in blanket)
Garlic Prawns, yes, they are just fantastic as all the reviews have stated.

Ordered:
-Crispy duck with coconut curry
-Garlic Prawns 
-Coconut Ice cream
-Fried Rice
-Pad Thai
-Green Curry

The crispy duck is a huge filet of duck floured and deep fried then cut into slices and drenched in a creamy and spicy coconut curry sauce. The skin is still incredibly crispy and the fattiness cuts out the spiciness of the curry very well.  MUST GET.

The garlic prawns: basically tiger prawns half de-shelled so that their bodies are chilling outside of the shell but still wearing them like a cape. Then they are deep fried and tossed in garlic and white pepper. The shell was the best part! So crispy, salty, slightly spicy, and not the least bit oily. It was just endless crunchfuls of deliciousness. MUST GET. These fried shells are better than chips. Better than fried pork skins. Better than any crunchy savory combo item you can ever dream of. GET THESE. They are expensive.

The coconut ice cream was very interesting. Order it. Creamy yet refreshing, it had a flavor almost similar to taro.

Other stuff were whatever. The portions here are small. Be prepared to spend more here than at your regular Thai restaurant.

Grilled beef with rice powder- decent, nothing super exciting. A little too much mint

Whole catfish- the best dish since it was tender with crunchy skin and the sauce is savory, spicy and sweet. 

Som thom- papaya salad- no dried shrimp or crab. Very basic

Drunken noodles- a little oily and too overlooked so the noodles were mushy.

Whole hen- it actually was reg chicken- that's what the waiter said. The flavor was really nice but the chicken was so tiny and a little dry. 

***the rice was dry and old. I don't understand why restaurants serve horrible rice when in Asia it's a staple and considered a main course not a condiment or complimentary side. It makes such a huge difference eating good rice. 

The meal came out to $100. The portions were tiny other than the catfish.",1,0,0

I highly recommend the garlic prawn if you want to win people over. Lotus is also famous for their curries which I can't get enough of! I love that they'll do special orders- I take that to mean all the food is cooked fresh in their kitchen. 

For dessert, I love their coconut ice cream with sticky rice.

The service is good despite being overwhelmed with customers on most evenings. Make a reservation for weekend nights (which you have to do 24 hours in advance).

Meeting some panhandlers during the walk in is just a part of the Lotus experience now. So is the cafeteria-style seating and the slighlty strange decor.

That being said, the awards that this restaurant has gotten are well deserved. For my friends who visit town, I always consider Lotus a must-do stop.

Since I've had limited experience, I'm in no place to judge how it ranks in the whole country but it now has my vote, for sure.

Everything we had was wonderful.  Service was superb.  We couldn't believe how fast the food was served after we ordered.  We started with the fried jerky with a spicy sauce which I understood was a Northern Thai dish.  It was an interesting, unusual and tasty appetizer unlike anything we had ever eaten before.

My son had the crispy duck panang in a spicy cream sauce.  The waiter asked for his spicy preference on a scale of 1 to 10.  My son said 6, I said mild which the waiter translated as 2 and we both said our dishes were perfect.  I've never been a fan of duck but I tried a bite and it was very good.   The steamed vegetables he ordered as a side were picture perfect.

I was tempted to try the whole smoked catfish but decided to start with something a little less ambitious.  I ordered the pan fried smoked catfish prepared with vegetables and a curry sauce.

I had high hopes for Lotus of Siam. This is the first time I tried it even though I've raved about this place to families and friends for the longest time because of reviews and tv shows. The first time we went here, the line was too long so we ate down the plaza at another amazing Thai restaurant called Arawan. It was delicious and everybody said the food was good. Not one bad dish. 

I stopped by here last night because my sister in law wanted Asian food. Somewhere not on the strip because American can't do Asian food right. It's also much more expensive than off the strip. We came 30 minutes before closing. Maybe that's why the food wasn't up to standard but that's no excuse. If you're open, you provide consistent quality of food throughout the day. 

Our server was great and attentive. Recommend us to try the Penang Curry. 

Food:

- Papaya Salad
- Tom Yum with Chicken 
- Panang Curry with Chicken 
- Beer Liver 
- Pad Thai

Tom Yum was extremely sour. Too much lemongrass and no balance of flavor. Worst Tom Yum I've ever had. This was the starter and I was already felt disappointed. 

Papaya Salad was okay. Not enough fish sauce, lime, and chili. It was a bit plain in tasting. Should be a bit more overpowering of fish sauce and chili. That's how I like the papaya salads in Thailand. 

Panang Curry with Chicken was the best dish. It was well balance in flavor and a nice little kick of heat. Not too much coconut sauce which some places that makes it a bit too creamy. Eat this with white rice and it was great. 

Beef Liver. My brother got this and I wouldn't recommend it. The sauce is a bit too sour and the Liver is gamey. 

Pad Thai was okay also. Nothing too great this dish that stands out. At least it's not sour or too much sauce like some other places. But it was ok considering the other dishes wasn't spectacular. 

One of the female waiter came to pick up our tab and open to check the amount in there which is weird. One of the dollar had some purple stuff on it. It was part of the tip and none of us had another dollar to change it to. She gave us a weird look and I'm just thinking, it's part of your tip. You don't have to take it if you don't  want.

What to order:
- Khao Soi - A curry noodle dish from the Northern menu. You don't find Northern Thai food too often in restaurants, but based on this dish, we should see it more. You've had Pad Thai a million times, get this superior noodle dish instead.
- Garlic Prawns - Not overly greasy, not quite tempura, not quite salt baked, utterly perfect. The prawns are huge, well seasoned, and the shells (also fried) are equally delicious!
- Crispy Duck in Penang - I've basically only had duck cooked the Chinese way (roasted, Peking-style, or braised) or the western way (confit or medium rare breast). This is a whole new world of preparation, and it's incredible. The texture is great without sacrificing flavor. And baby, I could bathe in that panang. 

Tips:
- If you're going for dinner, you'll want to make a reservation. Lunch doesn't take reservations, so just get there as early as possible.
- Dishes are pricier than other Thai restaurants, and they are also typically smaller (trust me, it's well worth it!). Order accordingly. 
- The spice scale (from 1-10) is calibrated toward an American palate. So if you're like me and have a real need for heat, order EVERYTHING at level 10. You can request for it even higher if you really want to punish your GI tract.
- Driving is preferable as the cabs can be unreliable. I'd keep your valuables out of sight though.

If you're only having one meal it Vegas, eat here.
If you're staying for several days, eat here at least twice.",4,1,4

I was overjoyed to finally eat here once and for all.  The place is located in a bizarre open shopping square area off the strip.  Some of the neighboring shops I noticed were a Korean place, a billiards supply store, a few gay bars, a gay gym, and yes, a full blown all out Sex Club for swingers and singles.  Wow.

When you walk into LoS, you notice right away that they didn't put a lot of attention in the design or presentation of the restaurant.  I saw lots of old wood on the walls, with several framed photos of celebs that have eaten there.  The restaurant was somewhat maze-like with halls and alleys leading all over the place.  I was surprised to see a lunchtime buffet there, but I stuck to the regular menu\/

I ordered what turned out to be perhaps THE tastiest Pad Thai I've EVER eaten - and that includes genuine Thai places in Bangkok.  The noodles had a golden caramelized nuttiness to them - something I never experienced before, but really enjoyed.  Same with the thai iced tea - very pleasing, and again, perhaps the best I've ever had before.

Price wise, items were maybe $2-3 more than most other Thai places, and portions seemed to be a little on the smaller end of the scale.  Not a big deal, seeing how the food tastes so damned great!

4 outta 5 stars from me, I'll return to indulge in some heavenly Thai grub the next time I'm in Vegas.",6,6,5

(penciled in for Saturday instead of Friday). We were seated despite the mix up AND before our ""reservation"" time.  Low and behold, I am impressed, we were off to a good start! 

With all of my party seated and accounted for, our food server for the evening promptly took down our appetizer orders. Much to my continued surprise by the stellar service at this Thai house of awesomeness, our food arrived in a timely fashion and our orders were not only CORRECT, but none forgotten! 

The only glitch in the evening was during dinner service; one or two meals trickled out behind the rest. When I inquired within, it was explained that they have several cooks preparing at different stations so the timing for each meal prepared is not always exactly on point with the rest. With that being said, all is forgiven for these delicious eats.

 It's quite a daunting task for most restaurant establishments to place the correct order, number one, let alone place it and not forget to bring it all to the table at the same time.

My take on food quality is this. Quite tasty. Being oh so unoriginal, I ordered the Pad Thai and vegetable fried rice. I know, I know.. for someone so creative there is a lot to be said about my creativity while dining..but I digress.

The Pad Thai was exceptionally delicious, not dry, noodles cooked to perfection. Dislike: the server did fail to ask me at what heat level I would like my dish therefore I was left with absolutely NO spice what so ever. I may be unoriginal in dining dish decision making, but I do like to spice things up..with spices.

So, the food, they rate their spiciness from 1-10. The first time we got curry and it was an 8. That is way too much. There were 4 or 5 different kinds of chili and the seeds. It made it difficult to enjoy the meal. The second time we came here we got a 4 and  even a 4 is good enough. Depending on your dish a 4 has some jalapeño seeds so there's a nice kick already.

Since moving out to Las Vegas a few years ago, I have always heard about LOS, but have never ventured out to give them a try.  And when I finally went with a group of Meetup folks, the overall experience was positive.

LOS is a Thai restaurant that does truly deserves the many accolades that has been given by food critics, from the ranks of professionals to amateurs, from all around the world over the years.  The restaurant features a fairly large menu selection, some are common and easy to find on other menus, but more importantly it has entrées and specials that are not available in most other Thai restaurants in the US.  

Now, I am not saying every dish that is prepared and served from the kitchen is perfect and absolutely delicious, because it is not.  But out of the thirteen we ordered, there was only one I did not really cared for, most are good, and some are truly excellent.  Some items I thought was overpriced, while others I felt deserves the price charged.

Food highlights:
Prawn Ocha - Unique preparation of an otherwise common ingredient.  Delicious and highly recommended.  It is pricey, but definitely worth trying at least once. ($21.95)

#116 Drunken Noodle Seafood - Pan fried flat rice noodle
topped with, sauteed assorted seafood with fresh & dry chili,
Thai basil served on bed of green. ($12.95)

Desserts!  Their Fried Banana Roll is a little different from those served elsewhere, their Mango and Sticky Rice (the mango was surprisingly ripe and tasty for March, while the sticky rice was just A+), the Coconut Ice Cream was good.

Hits The Spot:
#130 Green Curry with Sliced Chicken. Nothing fancy, but is still good. ($9.95) 

#85  Spicy Catfish with Basil Leaves - Sautéed deep fried thin catfish slice without bone in fresh and dried chili and Thai basil leaves. ($13.95)

Dislikes:
#14 Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice Salad with Minced Sour Sausage) - not particularly interesting, and way too much lime for my taste.  Although others on Yelp, ChowHound, etc raves about it. So give it a try, and decide for yourself.

Service - Acceptable.  We had a large party of 11, and they did their best to provide decent level of service.  The kitchen was also able to space out the timing of serving the dishes, otherwise there will definitely not be any room to put everything we ordered on the two tables they put together to seat our group.

Recommended group size: Small parties of 1-2, 3-4, or 7or 8 (small 2 tops, 4 tops, or 2x 4 tops). Anything larger, you will just be squeezed into tables that should seat 8 comfortably. 

Make reservations in advance!  Especially if you have a large group.

Food: 3.5 - some hits and some misses. The noodles all seems to be good to great.
Service: 3 - probably provides better service for smaller and more manageable parties.
Ambiance: 4.5 - It is brightly lit, which I prefer, so I can see my food and how artfully it has been presented.
Price: 3 - Some items seems overpriced, while others deserved the markup.  Our party average $32\/person (no wine), and we were able to try a lot of food.

If I can give it a 3.5 I would, because it is better than just ""A-OK"", but not really good enough for the ""Yay! I'm a fan"".",8,3,5

It might be difficult and often times challenging to get into the restaurant because there's usually a wait, and people shuffling to get in or get out. 

When you finally get to be inside, (assuming that you might have to wait outside of the restaurant for a bit) and get a chance to see all the pictures of the celebrities that came into the restaurant, you can't help but wonder how the heck Lotus of Siam got the chance to entertain the celebrities they had the opportunity to cook for. This place is somewhat a hole in the wall, and you would think that celebrities would confine themselves to big name restaurants where exclusively rich and powerful dine. Apparently not at Lotus of Siam; all sorts of people (rich, not so rich, big, small, tourists, locals, etc. etc.) come here to enjoy awesome Thai cuisine. 

They have a nice menu that covers all the traditional Thai dishes (pan fried noodles, salads, curries, soups, desserts) + specific specialties that I haven't found at any other Thai restaurant. If you're into hot and spicy, I would suggest taking an antacid before hand cuz their food can get crazy spicy where you'd probably be soaking in your clothes once you're done with your meal. 

I can't tell you a specific dish that stood out because honestly, they're ALL good. Everything is superb in flavor, freshness, overall quality. What did stand out was their prices and quantity. Lotus of Siam is a tad bit more expensive and you get a bit less of food than at other Thai food places. I have confidence that anything you purchase would be a great pick.

Also, while it appears that Lotus of Siam boasts to claim they have an amazing wine selection, I can't voucher for this as I never had the chance to purchase one of their wines there. Just FYI though, in terms of whether or not you're wondering what beverages they pride themselves over...

I'm wavering between a 3\/4 starts on this one...Definitely a great Thai food restaurant. Wouldn't say it's the best, but it sure is up there in Thai food places I'd dine in and come to again when I'm in the area.",0,0,0

We booked two shows and went looking on the internet to find something ""different"". When we came upon the Lip Smacking Foodie Tour we knew that it was for us. My wife and I both like to cook and we have visited most of the upper-tier restaurants in and around Chicago. We signed up for the evening strip tour with drinks. We hesitated when we saw the price but we said, what the heck, it seems overpriced but let's do it anyway.

We met our guides Abra and Donald, and the four other tour participants in front of the Aria at 6PM. For the next four hours we were treated to gracious hosts, reserved seating, luscious food and delicious drinks. An easy cop-out for the tour would to be to go the well known chef driven restaurants, the Guy Fieri's, the Wolfgang Puck's, etc... What we did instead was to go to the lesser know chef driven restaurants where the food is really delivered with commitment and passion. At each stop we were given three, and sometimes four, of the chefs signature dishes. I could not tell you which stop was my favorite as they were all great. We were always very heartily welcomed at the restaurants. The staff, and sometimes the chef him\/her self, would come out to explain the dishes and to thank us for coming. Be ready for somewhat adventurous eating. If meatloaf and mashed potatoes is your idea of a great meal out then this is probably not for you. And the drinks, they were always plentiful and delicious. They were also sure to complimented the food being served. Surprisingly, one was very elaborate, involving fire and alcohol vapor sipped from a beaker. Not only did the tour provide us with great food and drink, along the route we were treated to a behind the scenes tour and tasting of how chocolate was made and a very interesting stop at a unique shop that we had walked by several time without really noticing. Very cool! Don and Abra also pointed out several art installations that we had missed before. Nothing like a little culture with your movable feast.

The following day, when we showed the concierge at our hotel the prior evening's itinerary she was very impressed. She said that these were some of here favorite restaurants and that they were definitely ""under the radar"" for most tourists.  She said that she plans now to take the tour herself.

So, all in all it was a great experience. The food and drink was fantastic. The hosts did a great job and the walking part of the tour was interesting and enlightening. As far as the cost of the tour in concerned, we now feel that it is a drop dead bargain. If the experience sounds good to you, do not let the price deter you. I think that you will find that it is well worth the price of admission.",0,0,0

TIPS:
- Lotus of Siam is located inside a little mall so it may be hard to find given that you have to drive around in circles first looking for the entrance to the strip mall. 

FOOD:
- The Thai food here is delicious and high quality! Never thought I'd say that about Thai food, since most of your run of the mill Thai restaurants are super cheap fast food. However you can definitely taste the quality of the ingredients that Lotus of Siam uses. 
- Pad See Ew: Usually it's greasy and oily with a ton of sauce. However, the Pad See Ew at Lotus of Siam wasn't greasy at all, with the perfect balance of sauce. Furthermore the vegetables weren't bitter and tasted very sweet! 
- Tom Kah Kai Soup: Delicious but beware the chili pepper as it can get hot! However the milky coconut with the spicy soup makes for a perfect balance. 
- Papaya Salad: I'm usually not a fan of Thai papaya salad and prefer the darker Lao style since that's what I ate growing up. However the Papaya salad at Lotus of Siam is so delicious! 

OVERALL: 
- Highly recommend everyone to come eat here.",0,0,0

Lotus is very good with reasonable prices.  Located in a very random strip mall and (according to our cab driver) dangerous neighborhood, Lotus is a great surprise for out-of-town visitors.  

While the reputation of this restaurant precedes it, we were pleasantly surprised.  The food is not fancy but when exiting customers report that it's ""worth the wait"" to those waiting in 104 degree heat, you know you're know you're spending time well worth waiting.  Upon seating, we noted the myriad of photographs of famous (and mysterious) patrons who have eaten at Lotus.  

From the San Francisco Bay Area, where Thai restaurants are found on every corner, I found Lotus to capture traditional flavors, especially in the Crispy Rice appetizer and the large shrimp fried in their shells (which was amazing).  Aside from the scorching summer heat, the level of spiciness in the dishes can KO the novice.  The Thai pepper ""salsa"" is only for those with asbestos mouths--don't think that cucumber and carrots will save you, they won't.

With spice levels from 1-10, they can please any palette, spicy or mild.  Just be ready to sweat if u go near 10.
For dessert, don't skip the fried bananas with coconut ice cream and sticky rice. It's the perfect end to a spicy meal.

While the food was really good, I don't know that it necessarily lived up to its reputation, at least the night we were there.

Per the friendly waiter's recommendations, we had their ""signature"" deep-fried sour sausage appetizer, which was a unique starter.  It looks like deep-fried rice, actually, when it comes out, but apparently yes folks, that IS sausage.    Very strong flavors of sourness (from the lime juice?), hot chilis (spiciness can be to your requested level) and lots of other complex flavors all put into a very tasty combination.   

We moved onto their spicy beef, drunken seafood noodles, spicy seafood salad, and tom kah kai soup.

Spicy beef = 5 stars.   GREAT flavors, down to the lime juice - infused bed of cabbage that the beef is sitting on.

Drunken seafood noodles = 4 stars.  Good, but not life-changing.  Nice combination of lots of seafood (imitation crab, squid, shrimp, and ooh even a mussel was thrown in there!)

Spicy shrimp salad = 3.5 stars.  You can request the spiciness to the level of your comfort, and we asked for ""medium.""   We found the dish to be flavorful, but a bit too salty and a bit too spicy for our tastes.  I felt overwhelmed by the dish after a couple bites and couldn't really eat much more.

Tom kha kai soup = 4.5 stars.  VERY well-balanced, complex, fresh flavors.

No room for dessert, though I was very tempted to get coconut ice cream just to put out the fire in my mouth and mellow out all the strong flavors I'd just ingested.

Definitely a good place to go if you like Thai food and\/or strong \/ spicy flavors, but I don't know that it's the ""best Thai food in N. America.",3,1,2

Lotus is the only Thai restaurant that includes dishes cooked with jackfruit and other exotic ingredients. They also make a killer fried catfish dish which is smothered in a sweet chili sauce.

SPICY SLICED BEEF with Thai Round Eggplant- (heat level 5) tangy, spicy, fresh and delectable. The slices of eggplant were similar to the taste of horseradish, which accented the smokey charred beef nicely.

KOONG TENN- grilled shrimp covered in spices on a bed of cabbage. The shrimp were delicately cooked, with no signs of toughness. The chilies and spices that topped each shrimp were spicy and flavorful. The cabbage was a nice extinguisher to put out the fire in my mouth. 

PAD SE-EW- flat rice noodles with egg, broccoli and chicken in dark soy sauce. This is my standard order at any Thai place and their version didn't disappoint.

Of course, LoS was high on the list and it didn't disappoint!

LoS always gets the following accolades: ""gotten the nod from the James Beard Foundation"", ""the place where all the local chefs come to eat"", ""one of the best Thai restaurants in North America"", blah blah blah. Everyone has said it, heard it and knows it. Whatever. It's great and still my gold standard outside of kidnapping my friend's Thai mom and having her cook my dishes out of my own kitchen!

A few noteworthy changes if you haven't been there in awhile (since March 2010 according to our waiter):
1. They've expanded into the now defunct Korean restaurant that used to be on the right side of the LoS.
2. They've remodeled the inside...it's no longer the ""hole-in-the-wall"" greatness it used to be...everything is def. more upscale albeit in the same dive Commerical Center with the Green Door*.
3. They expanded the old wine ""cabinet"" into a friggin' 15' glass wine cellar centered prominently in the middle of the newly redecorated interior. Way cool!
4. There's a nice new shiny bar on the far right side of the resto - cool.
5. 2 sets of bathroom now - the older ""boys"" and ""girls"" side on the left and now the much nicer and (thank God) larger (multi-stalls) ""men"" and ""women"" bathrooms on the left side. No more waiting in the hallways!

A few extra notes\/details on the food (this visit):
1. We ordered four entrees (Pad See Ew, Mee Krob, Tofu Penang Curry and a Northern style curry made with catfish) and 2 apps (Tom Kha Gai and Tod Mun) for 5 people. Plenty of food and everyone finished up the meal for bill of $75 including 4 drinks. Not bad!
2. Spice level was low for this meal at a ""5""  b\/c we were catering to a wide range of palates, but as a note you can always request the pepper rack for those that want more. Honestly tho, if you do request the ""10""...it's spicy greatness and you won't be disappointed...but just be aware. I love it at the level. 
3. What I loved the most (generally speaking) was the delicate flavours of the dishes. I didn't find any sort of heavy handedness when it came to the flavor profiles - not too sweet, not too gunky (no fillers), etc.
4. The Penang was incredible and had this beautiful creamy nuttiness to it....you could taste the complexities of flavours in it - a richness from the coconut milk, not too sweet, with hints of the kefir in it. Just a note, if you haven't been here...most dishes can be substituted for veggie friendly (i.e., tofu) and they willingly suggest it if you can't find something you like.
5. The Pad See Ew was gorgeous. It had that high heat smoky flavor to it I crave in the dish. Not too sweet and a balanced flavour with the basil leaves - i.e., not overly ""basily"" as some places make it. So good...you could taste the individual ingredients in the dish!
6. I wasn't a fan of the Mee Krob, but it was tasty and well done. It's just not my favorite dish for Thai cuisine.
7. The Tod Mun is done the way I like it. Thin patties that are just luscious and perfectly seasoned\/fried and complemented with the cucumber dressing. The crispness of the cabbage and the cucumbers provides the perfect textural complement to the home made fish patties with bits of green onions throughout.
8. The Tom Kha Gai had that nice bit of sourness and just enough heat to start off the meal properly. A very flavourful broth with the bits of lemon grass and galangal throughout.
9. The unique and different item was the northern Thai style curry - it was very broth-like but good. Almost reminiscent of the Thom Kha Gai, but no lemongrass in it. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, but found it more mild in taste and the flavours were *VERY* subtle and refined. So, if you're expecting bold typical Thai flavours...be warned and you might want to pass on this dish. Otherwise, it's a nice change from the usual typical dishes one can order.

A few notes on service:
Excellent as always. Not too invasive, yet not too rushed. We had a leisurely dinner therefor several hours - even after finishing our meal, we sat and continued talking and never once felt like we were being rushed out. They even came by and refilled out drinks while we talked!

If you haven't figured this out...yeah, I love and miss this place a lot. Living on the east coast now really highlights how different and how much better the Thai food is out west.

It's located in the outskirts of Vegas (or maybe downtown Vegas) but we're so glad we found it.  We ordered the garlic prawns ($22~) and the drunken noodles with crispy duck.  It was enough for two people for lunch.  The prawns were so delicious.  They were perfectly fried that even the shell was crispy and eatable.  The drunken noodles were so tasty.  It was a little on the spicier-end but overall a good mix with the crispy duck.  Wish I lived in Vegas to have it all the time and try the other dishes but definitely a gem.,0,0,0

We tried the beef jerky, Issan sausage, the northern specialty egg noodles with curry, the crispy duck in Penang curry, and the drunken noodles with garlic prawns. We also ordered the sticky rice, since we thought the dishes did not come with rice. 

Beef jerky: think warmed up thick beef jerky and serving it with a spicy sauce. Tasty but tough. 

Issan sausage: not enough caramelization, sausage filling was loose in the casing, and the lemongrass flavor dominated. 

Egg noodles curry: we mixed in the raw onions and the line juice. Tasty but it is basically curry sauce and egg noodles. Not much to get excited about. 

Crispy duck: delicious! Crispy, salty, savory, and slightly sweet from the coconut milk in the curry. Worth getting this dish! ! ! 

Drunken noodles: okay, maybe it was my mistake thinking that since this is a noodle dish, noodles would be a good portion of it. Nope. It was mainly the prawns. . .which is generous but I really wanted the flat rice noodles! 

Sticky rice: strange enough, they actually placed a huge bowl of regular long grained rice on the table. Then we were also given little containers of sticky rice that was hard, too chewy, and hard to eat compared to the long grained rice. It would have been good the waiter to ask if we really needed both as we misunderstood the menu where it clearly states rice is not included followed by the note that sticky rice is $2.50 a person. Annoying.

For four people, it was $125 with tip, so not too bad. Totally shady area but worth heading out if you rented a car!",0,0,0

It reminded me of authentic Chinese dishes, which has better flavor... probably because of the MSG), and crispy duck drunken noodles (again, this reminded me of authentic Chinese dishes which I like more).

The curry was good, I thought a bit mild for medium, but then I chomped down on a chunk of jalapeno that I thought was bell pepper that was not listed as an ingredient.  The only thing other than the chicken was some bamboo shoots and some basil and of course a whole jalapeno cut lengthwise. Also ordering off the menu takes a lot longer to get service and food.

We ordered a tofu pad thai, freshly fried catfish {#64}, jackfruit curry with chicken, panang curry with shrimp and a bowl of rice. 

The servings are quite small. We were able to get by since a bunch of us were still quite full from our lunch earlier in the day. But, if we were ravishing starving, I hardly think an order of each, sans the fried catfish would be enough for us. 

The pad thai looked different from the normal pad thai I'm used to eating. They use a thinner clearer noodle and a darker sauce. It looked like it was severely stirred fried. Still had the pad thai taste and I enjoyed it very much. Just wished that there was much more of it. This was the tiniest of the entree's. 

The star of the show was our fried catfish. It was huge! We got several beady eye looks once it arrived to our table. Besides the great appearance, it didn't disappoint! It was fresh, meaty, and crispy to perfection! 

The service in the beginning was a bit slow, but once we ordered, it got better. They had a person dedicated to just refilling water and he was dam good at it, too! Never did we have an empty glass.

Every card-carrying foodie from San Diego to Buffalo knows the lore of the Thai restaurant with the chef who catered to a king, or something like that. Cab rides to this Commercial Center restaurant are probably second only to cab rides to [insert most popular strip club]. (Despite my name, I don't know the strip circuit scene.)

There is a lot of hype, which perhaps make it easy to disappoint, but at the same time it is an off-the-beaten-path hole-in-the-wall, which makes it easy for folks to think they have discovered Mecca. I had waited to write a review because I had only been there once four years ago, and I felt that I needed to give LOS another try. The first time I went I strayed from my usual Thai curries and ordered some Northern Thai specialties. I was disappointed. I thought it was overpriced and undergood.

Last night, I went back for a second tasting, and I ordered curries. The red and massaman curries were good, solid Thai, but the portions were a bit small, and the vegetable selection included baby corn-- a pet peeve. Plus, they do not have one single grain of brown rice. 

They underwent a mysterious renovation, which somehow involved more tan paint and a wall in the middle of the dining area, but that is just a side note.

I am really torn because I find it hard to contradict years of sentiment and foodie dogma, and I am thinking that perhaps the true gems of LOS are specialty items that I have yet to order. When it comes to Thai, I am so happy with my curries and rice, I never want a specialty item, so for me, it would not be worth a 45-minute wait or an expensive cab ride, but the other day when we were dining next door, we met a man from NY who has the food Fed Ex'd to his house, so there has to be something there.

Lotus of Siam is definitely a ""destination restaurant."" Located in one of Vegas's more depressed and delapidated business centers, Lotus of Siam's offerings of very traditional Thai cuisine, and service, have become the reason for local celeb's, and tour groups, to travel to this unassuming location. While I just can't proclaim this or any spot as the ""Best Thai Food"" in the US...  given that this is ""Vegas Baby""..... Lotus of Siam is a real find. And in fact, if this operation were in a major hotel, it would probably be the star attraction... especially given my lowered opinion, over the years, of Vegas Strip restaurants.

When my business associate and I arrived at Lotus this past Wednesday evening, around 6pm, I noticed the taxis dropping off clients. He noticed the ""tour bus"" stopping right in front of the restaurant, behind the taxis. His first words? ""Let's book it and get in before they unload!"" We quickly realized after entering that there are two dining rooms. It appeared busloads, and groups, are seated in the second dining room, where they're set up for larger groups. We had nothing to worry about.

My thanks to Anita L., Irvine, for contributing her review to the line-up. After our first exhibit day, Wednesday, at a trade show in the Rio, I was thinking of how to follow up our Tuesday setup day. Tuesday found us ""dinnering"" at Memphis Championship BBQ in Henderson. It's one of my ""regular stops"" when in town. But for something different, I typed in ""Thai"", and at the top of the list was Lotus. Anita's one of my yelp-buds, and I respect her opinion. And with Thai cuisine, and for me, anyone who's visited or lived ""in-country"" certainly would have a ""Thai Standard.""

Following Anita's review comments about ""traditional cuisine..."", I decided to see if I could replicate my taste experiences when I lived in a Lao-Thai village in Ubon, circa late 60's. For our table of two, I ordered the papaya salad, chicken satay, soft spring rolls, sticky rice, lard na (noodles) with beef, and yellow-coconut curry with chicken. Add to that a total of four Thai iced teas. (I make them at home!) It was a very good meal. The food actually did remind me of the food I ate in Thailand. I have to say that even the wait-staff's level and type of service was typical to any nice restaurant I've ever visited in Thailand.

If you're thinking ""Thai"" in town, and to join in the cheer..... I'm voting Lotus of Siam  a ""Best Bet in Vegas."" And evidently, Louis Anderson, an entertainer who by ""form"" exhibits that he knows good food, thinks so too! Our table was directly under his signed photo with the owner. I'm sure this was one time that he... ""...wasn't kidding!""   :-))",12,10,11

+ Sea Bass Drunken noodles - So the noodles portion of this was only OK....but the Sea Bass?!?!!? AMAZING. Next time I might order Sea Bass over papaya salad.

Definitely order either the coconut ice cream or a thai tea just to cut some of that spice...

The only dish I probably wouldn't order again is the Nua yum katiem. It was the only dish that I felt like there wasnt a party in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, it was still very yummy. I wouldn't order it again only because they have such an extensive menu and I'd like to try new dishes.

Service- attentive and helpful. I had a very bad experience at a Thai restaurant due to their spice level. If you're from LA, you've probably heard of Jitlada. I ordered a dish and they never asked for the spice level or neither bothered to explain how spicy the dish was. It was to the point my head started hurting and I couldn't eat anything afterward. Well unlike Jitlada, this restaurant explain the spicy level and what was appropriate for each dish.

FYI- wait is always long. It's about an hour wait.",2,1,1

They do take reservations and it is a must unless you want to wait a long while.

This place is called a ""Las Vegas Classic.""  So hyped.  And as always, it is always hard to meet the hype and it fails a tad here at Lotus of Siam.  Why?  Mainly because the dishes seemed rushed out and you can taste a lack of that sweet care from the chef.  Understandable though because they need to turn tables as fast as possible due to such high demand.

So many famous people have come here, yes, its one of those places as you enter you see all the pictures on the wall of who's who that's has dined here.  The wine selection is stellar as you see it the moment you hit the dining room.  The Service is great, the hostesses are pleasant.  Now to the food.

Papaya Salad - Solid.  The spice associated with the salad was mouthwatering.  This is a dish to order always as it starts it all off perfectly.  It is clean, light, fresh, prepares you for the rest of dinner.

Khao Soy (Crispy Duck, Egg Noodle) - Now this dish is quite stellar.  It is the Northern Thai variant of Khao Soy.  The duck is crispy, but not like the garlic shrimp, more like a crispy, breaded type.  It is succulent, tender, just perfect.  Egg Noodles are perfect and the yellow coconut curry goes all perfectly together.  This is one of those dishes I can have 2-3x a week and I look forward to most when coming here.

Crispy Garlic Shrimp - The hypness hits a roadblock here.  The most famous dish here.  You expect it to be jaw dropping, mouth watering.  It isn't.  The skin is perfectly done to a crisp (you eat it), and the shrimp are of a good size (see picture).  For what most everyone raves about here, I will say it is good, it is tasty, but the star of the restaurant?  Only for people who are novels to it.  Would I order it again?  Yes.  But I would tell my table its one of the entrees that are good here, not the, ""OMG WE HAVE TO ORDER THISSSSSS.""

Panang -  Decent.  Nothing to write home about.

Green Curry - Forgettable.  Wait, we had green curry?

Sea Bass -  Totally overpriced and small portion.  Skip this.  Nuff said.  This dish is almost a whole Star doc worthy.

Fried Banana with Coconut Ice Cream Dessert - Delicious.  Small chunks of banana fried in an egg roll style.  The delicate thin crispiness was very well appreciated by my mouth.  The coconut ice cream was light and heavenly.  Must Order Dish.

Vibe - Great.  The whole place is hummin along, happy, eatin, drinkin, laughing.  It is like all my Thai friends.  

The menu here is huge.  North and South.  Most of the good dishes seem to come from Northern menu.  We enjoyed it here but like I said, the dishes seemed rushed, but for understandable reasons.  Glad to have tried it.  Come back on next Vegas trip?  Probably not (mainly because Vegas has so many options).

We ordered the panang curry with beef.  We only asked for mild spiciness and it was a bit spicy for me, just a warning if you're sensitive to spiciness. It was still delicious though and the spiciness did not bother me too much.  

Also ordered the Nua Nam Tok which is sliced charbroiled beef mixed with green onions, chili, lime juice & rice powder.  It also had cilantro which was not listed on the menu.  It was AMAZING!!!  Loved it!

Lotus of Siam changed everything.

I came out here during my bachelor party and was the first spot for dinner on our first night. It's quite a venture from the strip, and would heed caution for people coming out around the area to just be careful. We got there without making a reservation and the wait was decent but bearable. Considering we took about a 20 minute drive out, we decided to wait. There's plenty of seating, I'd say close to 100 people but this restaurant still have a wait and is poppin'.

Food we ordered:

Garlic Prawns (MUST ORDER)
Soft Shell Crab Drunken Noodle
Crispy Duck Penang (MUST ORDER)
Pad Khee Mao
Spicy Fried Rice
Some sausages which I can't remember the name of 
Fried Banana w\/ Coconut Bliss

Can't go through everyone item, but the garlic prawns were the winner of the dinner. I really enjoyed the Crispy Duck as well - it had a great crispiness on the outside, and it was so tender and juicy on the inside. The sauce was amazing too - just dipped everything in that sauce.

Their spicy basil sauce (on whatever meat you choose) is delicious. I had it on three dishes: the catfish, with minced chicken on the pad kee mao, and later on a whole fried red snapper. Sauce is right on the money.

The green papaya salad is my favorite I've ever had. Crisp, well marinated: it bursts with flavor. Make sure you get it spicy though. We got it medium, and one time it was fairly hot, the next time it was not hot enough. I would err on the side of too spicy next time. Nice ripe tomato bits in it also.

I liked the Crisp Rice Salad with Minced Sour Sausage, but dining partner wasn't impressed. I thought it had interesting texture to the rice with a concentrated flavor, though the sausage looked more like ham.

We also tried the Northern Larb...also a flavor concentration and quite good. It has minced pieces of pork and spices: very tasty but a little unusual.

Oh, Pad Woon Sen with shrimp was wonderful but it's hard to mess that up.

Only disappointment for me was the Khao Soi (yellow curry with rice noodles)...it was OK, but didn't stand out among others I've had.

Definitely finish the meal with the coconut ice cream. Home-made, rich, luxurious, perfect slightly melted temperature, small frozen bits of coconut embedded. This actually is what drew us back to LOS for a 2nd day in a row.

I had heard so many great things about the nam kao tod, so that was a must try. We also ordered the drunken noodle with prawns and the choo chee duck. The food came out quickly and the food portions were incredibly generous. The spice level was no joke. I had heard they were famous for spice, so we ordered a 5 to stay on the safe side. We typically order a 7 or 8 at other restaurants, but we were very glad that we erred on the side of caution. The flavors were amazing. The name kao tod had the perfect flavors and texture. The drunken noodle were also terrific. So was the choo chee. The duck was cooked perfectly and I loved the sauce.

I would often travel to Vegas just to eat there and once even flew in from in from a posting in Africa.  Since they have expanded into the wig shop next door, however, it seems that they care only about volume and not about custom made, tasty Thai food.  Last week I went for dinner my first night in town and ordered my favorite dish, their signature crispy rice with sour sausage.  I ordered it very got (8\/10) like I normally do.  When it arrived it had no spice at all and was lukewarm.  It was obvious that they had made a large vat of it and were just slopping it out as if in a prison cafeteria.  The other dishes we ordered, panang curry and drunken noodles, were equally ""blah.""

Since this was my favorite place in the world, I gave them another try.  I went for lunch a few days later figuring that since most people eat the lunch buffet I would be able to get a made to order crispy rice.  This time it wasn't even lukewarm.

Service was on PAR they were quick & not once did u see my glass of water ever get below half way. They really had TEAMWORK on point. We had a reservation at 6pm & the place was PACKED even in the little waiting area & it did NOT slow down at all even as we were leaving....

The plaza that this resteraunt is located literally makes you re-think if you want to be dining there.... but do Not let this fool you or drive you away in any way! Definitely like finding a treasure box in the middle of the desert!
The interior was simple w\/ not too much cluttering decor. The waiting area & entrance was quite small. There are a whole but of pictures that are framed of all the famous people that have dined here one being the GREAT Chef Joel Robouchon. They also have a glass cellar of wines galour that is one of the only thing that makes this resteraunt give it a CLASSY look hahahaha =]

SPICY WINGS $8.95 - just full of flavor & the right amount of spice to blend w\/ the sweetness

SCALLOP DRUNKEN NOODLE $23.95 - Scallops were HUGE & again another flavor packed dish

FRIED WHOLE FISH - this fish was amazing like the bones we're crispy enough to be like chips.

GARLIC PRAWN $26.95 - OMG OMG I could eat a freaken whole plate to myself. The crispyness of this dish is PERFECTION!

PLAR LAAD PORK $25 - I think this one was the curry sauce that went well w\/ the rice that it came with.
 
NAM KAO TOD $8.95 - a nice crispy rice appetizer dish that is refreshing w\/ the perfect amount of spice & still refreshing w\/ some weggies on the side.

FRIED BANANA ROLL $8.50 - cute little wonton shell rolled banana w\/ the perfect crunch to every bite

MANGO & STICKY RICE $8.95 - O_O soon good!! They also do NOT serve this dish if the mango is not to perfection!

YUM NAUH $13.95 - THAI beef salad refreshing w\/ a kick

THAI TEA $2.50 - not the BEST that I've had but it was still good.

I almost decided to give up finding a decent Thai restaurant until 1 day driving to a relatives house in Las Vegas I stumbled to this place. Outside it does not look like much but inside it's wonderful and the food is to die for. For those that love Pad Thai go outside the box and try something different.

I had read about this place before and looked at its list of reviewers.  One after the other giving it praise.  

I convinced my family to try it out and once we parked I could tell no one was thrilled about the way it looked from the outside or the sketchy area it seemed to be in.  Once we walked inside, I could tell it was huge, way bigger than it gives off from the outside and it was jammed packed ( always a good sign when trying someplace new).  The host told us it would be a 2 hour minimum wait.  At those words my BF began to walk back towards the door, he hates waiting, let alone two hours ( which, when youre hungry is an eternity). I was so excited to try it but two hours is kinda long, we could always come back! 

As I begin to make my way to the door a man standing in line, leans over and tells me its worth the wait.  Dammit, now I want to wait.  

I round everyone back up and tell them its going to be amazing.  We can wait!  Plus we can enjoy each others company and spend some quality time chatting with each other.  

If youve ever been there before, youll know that there isnt really anywhere to wait. Sure, you could go outside, but in December its a bit chilly.  Inside, theres a little waiting room that holds about four people max.  Its pretty tight and those chairs should be saved for someone that perhaps cant stand as long.  

We end up against the glass wall to the wine room.  In the direct path of all the waiters pushing carts loaded with hot plates of amazingness, back and forth from the kitchen to the large dining room near the bar.  Talk about torture.  

Our wait ended up being about 1:45 minutes and after viewing and smelling the amazing dishes going back and forth we had a good idea of what we wanted.  And you know what?  Completly worth it!!!

We ordered a few different plates and shared them all.  Nothing was left, everything was enjoyed and devoured!!

Skip the stuff that sounds familiar; pad Thai, drunken noodles, etc. and go straight to the Northern Thai section of the menu. We ordered the Khao Soi which had egg noodles in a coconut cream curry base, beef, and pickled veggies. I wanted to dive into that broth it was so good and the noodles were the perfect texture. We also got the Northern Larb which was surprisingly light and spicy, lots of lime and pork. Lastly, we got Kang Ka Noon, the jackfruit curry.

As for the overall food experience here, I'd have to give it 3 stars for sure. It took a while after we were seated for us to receive menus. The server was very nice and friendly, it did get pretty busy at the end of our meal, but the service wasn't as prompt as it could've been. Our food arrived pretty fast, but it just took an unusually long time to order and to get our check at the end.

I tried the Khao Soi with beef. I usually always go with what the server recommends to me. It was decent, honestly. People around me tried the Nam Prik Hed and the soup Tom Kha Kai. Everyone said the food tasted fairly good. 

I'd definitely want to come back to try a meal again. Try a different dish perhaps. Hopefully a better updated review to come...",1,0,1

Lotus of Siam has certainly benefited from positive coverage and word of mouth--just on my flight into Vegas, two groups seated next to me were talking about upcoming reservations.  But hype is a double-edged sword:  my expectations for my dinner were so high that nothing short of an unforgettable, ""I'll be talking about this years from now,"" kind of meal was going to be good enough.  Amazingly, Lotus of Siam met those expectations, and then some.

My extended family (party of 9) arrived at Lotus, and I immediately got ragged on--I am known for taking trips off the beaten path in pursuit of great meals, with mixed results, since most of my family generally favors ""meat and potatoes"" kind of establishments.  Lotus's location in a less-than-beautiful strip mall did not win me any points, but once inside, the restaurant is large and comfortable.  Because we were warned that the restaurant does not hold reservations, we arrived 20 minutes early, and after a quick drink at the bar, we were seated.

Let's start with drinks--Lotus has all the standard beers and liquors you might expect at a Thai restaurant, but also has a very impressive (and appropriate) wine list, with great options at every price point.  This was a nice, unexpected touch.  Service was quick and friendly, as well.

As for the food, all I can say is that there was literally something for everyone:  the classics (Tom Kha, garlic prawns) that you can get at most Thai restaurants were made at a higher level.  There were outstanding vegetarian options for those who don't eat meat.  Some of the Northern Thai dishes were things I'd never seen before, and everything we tried (in particular, a green chili pepper dish) was a hit.  The curries were also universally delicious, and for those of you who like spice, rest assured that Lotus isn't afraid of adding real heat.  My brother joked that the menu was like the Cheescake Factory if it was good, and this is actually a pretty good analogy; it takes time to read through the encyclopedic menu and figure out what you're going to order, but at the end of the day, everything we chose was either very good or excellent.

This was an incredible meal, and I will never make a trip to Vegas without stopping by.",2,0,0

Good thing we were on the way out after being there for over 1.5 hour.  Kenny Lee\/Lees Liquor and his party started to show up for the back area and the bar area was starting to get jammed packed with people from the convention.

I saw truly say this because of it's sophistication and how it's evolved through the years. I went there ages ago when it was a small strip mall restaurant. This time around they got more space next door and a walk in wine cellar, really?! 

So you would imagine that the food quality would suffer it bit because of the volume of traffic, NOT A BIT! I actually found subtle hints of improved flavor profiles and a combination of natural ingredients. There's no heavy salt and powdered spices to mask the otherwise dull flavors that most places have. 

Most ethnic restaurants have the ideology of heavily spicing road kill and people would buy it. But if you really knew what it was you would puke before it got to the table. Anyway, what I mean is that you can easily mess up fish and spice, but not here. They really get it.

The menu is vast and complex for those who don't know much about Thai food, so ideally you want to go with a large group and get as much as you can to taste. 

This is also probably the only Thai restaurant in the country that I know of that has such a well selected wine list. I think I know wine but when I saw this I was shocked! Pairings from regions beyond us so you go in blind and it just works! They know their stuff and will guide you well.

If you want the best Thai food in Vegas or anywhere within 100s of miles, go here. 

Good God it was so delicious and you would never expect it from the looks of the outside. Located in a shipping center off the strip near the older part of town, you expect a hole-in-the-wall and that's what you get walking in. What you don't know is they expanded to the space next to where they originally opened up and it looks like a Michelin Star restaurant. Service was comparable to a Ruth's Chris or any topend steakhouse. Always catering to your needs although very busy. Huge wine cellar in plain site and all the James Beard and Zagat awards on the wall. 

The food. The food though!!! Don't make the mistake of ordering too much at once. Family style and the steamed white rice is endless. Hot pot Tom Kha Kai to start with medium spice. Super delicious, sour, spicy and the best way to start. Dishes came out shortly after. We also ordered the soft shell crab drunken noodles. The dish was super good but I want to focus on the first two I mentioned. Garlic Prawns. Came with the shells which were also fried. Best. Prawns. Ever. So good. But the true star: crispy duck Panang. Duck came in a lake of curry and still remained crispy. It was so good over rice and we ended up ordering another. 

Go here. Don't even hesitate. Go. You won't regret it. If you can find a better Thai place in the area, I challenge you to say that LoS isn't better. I CHALLENGE YOU! Aite?!?And bring your friends with you cause you might get embarrassed.",1,2,1

When I came in through the front door there were about 11 seats in the waiting area which were all full of customers waiting already. I put my name on the waiting list and was told it would be a 25 minute wait and that I could wait at the Bar. When I went to the bar all the seats were taken as well so I had no choice but to wait outside the restaurant. Luckily, it wasn't very busy that night and I only had to wait for 15 minutes for a party of 2. BEWARE usually it's about a 2 hour wait. 

I ordered the Nam Kao Tod which is a crispy rice that's quite sour tasting. In my opinion it was a little too sour for a rice dish. 

Next I had the coconut chicken soup (Tom Kah Kai) and it tasted like coconut milk mixed with chile oil. It was sweet so it seemed like a dessert but it had chicken and mushrooms which also made the dish savory. This mixture was a bit too odd for me and I would definitely not order this dish again. 

The Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab was also pretty disappointing considering the price. It was 18.95 with a small plate of noodles with a sprinkle of soft shell crab legs. Out of all the dishes I ordered I only liked the Musaman curry which was OK. 

If you came here on a busy night and had to wait longer than 30 minutes I would recommend not coming here considering the price. If you do decide to wait it out DON'T order the Nam Kao Tod, Tom Kah Kai, and Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab.

northern red curry: Yes, not much of a curry, more like a stew. Also not as sweet as panang..I think they use less coconut milk. So if you like coconut milk, you may not like this version of curry as much. 

beef dish: it was a cold dish...cubed filet mignon..anyway, we thought it would be warm so it was a little surprising..it tasted like the beef on the beef salad...good but nothing extraordinary.

catfish: breaded and sauced...pretty good...loved it! put the sauce on our rice and ate it up! You must try it!!

mango sticky rice: I looooooved this version...the rice was more complex in flavors than the others I've tasted...maybe I'm crazy...even  the mango pieces were perfectly ripe and was sweeter than normal, too...but it was really good...my friend who doesn't even like sweets, loved it, too...i could come back just for this...hopefully i'm not building it up too much...haha 

Wish they were local...",1,1,1

- it is expensive. 

Portions are ok but expect high end pricing for 8\/10 food. 
Nothing was to die for imo. 
President's thai in east pasadena is more flavorful and cost 50% less. 

They have a lot of wines... in house cellar maybe?

Parking is big. You have to go in  and park in the back where there is front door to the restaurant.  It appears to be a little run down outside.

I had ordered the red curry and the nam prik ong. It was quite well actually. For my birthday, I'd thought to treat my family to a place I've heard extensive publicity about. All of the reviews and pictures seemed to give it proper accolades so it was a must to eat there. We only waited 15 minutes, they sat us down, and we looked through the menu. We ordered our dinner, talked amongst each other about what we did during the day, and we waited. Once the food was out, the aroma made us happy and we began to eat. I thought the nam prik ong was supposed to arrive first like how I asked but I can eat it after my red curry. We ate slowly and still talked amongst each other. It was going well until we seen the servers standing by us, asking if we were done with our meals. Obviously if you stop eating to chat, the assumption of you being done seems questionable. But these welcoming men turned into vultures, constantly asking if we were finished. Their smiling demeanor turned into angst that made everyone uncomfortable. I took my time to finish my meal while they where practically begging us to ask for the check. I finished my red curry but I was still waiting for my nam prik ong. The server who took my order asked if he could clean the table while I surfed the web for places to go after. He asked politely if I can scoot over so they could rearrange the tables too. My family is waiting outside and I'm waiting for my other half that I ordered. I finally ask the man about it and he seemed hazed as if I was the one who decided to order at that very last minute. He even insisted on pulling out my chair so I could leave but I told him directly again about my order. I can see the sweat on his forehead as he wrote it down again. While I waited again, I can see everyone else was having a different experience. I saw the beautiful menu throughout the restaurant from what people had ordered. And I saw the money hungry people who run the place. I never want to feel like there's a price on my head again. I never ever want the servers to make it obvious that they're ""losing money"" because of our warmth as a family to chat amongst each other. I ate the red chili dip and left. My question is, how much did they pay you Anthony Bourdain and Action Bronson? How much did they pay you to say those kind words? That this is one of the greatest places to eat in Las Vegas.

The food was really great, particularly with regards to the main courses. Appetizers were all decent, if a tad boring (with the exception of the bacon and wonton-wrapped shrimp). The wontons and dumplings were only offered with chicken, while most of us would have preferred pork. The beer and wine list was quite good, and I even saw one of my favorite IPAs for a jaw-dropping $3.50 (though our table opted for Singhas all around - when in Thai restaurants, right?).

The entrees are what really got everyone excited. Our table was filled with drunken noodles, pad Thai, curries and more. My crispy duck over drunken noodles was excellent. I mostly stuck to the outer edges since duck is just so fatty by nature, but I was able to get the flavor I wanted from a few of the leaner bites with my delicious noodles. I requested my heat level at a four, which was perfect for me (I like things spicy but not uncomfortably so). A friend requested her shrimp in green curry at a four, and it seemed much hotter. So I'd probably knock that down to a three. 

Even though the food was awesome, the service was a bit spotty at times. It was hard to pinpoint which person was our main server. We had to ask for drink refills more than once and a requested knife was never delivered. Still, I would definitely like to return on my next visit to Las Vegas.

It's a little pricey and always packed in the evenings, and for good reason. This food is top notch, better than Komol or any other Thai restaurant I've been to in town. It's an an unassuming, unimpressive, and perhaps uninviting strip mall, but this area's always been home to a mix of dives and delights, don't judge the book by it's cover or the guy hitting you up for money in the parking lot.

Once inside, you'll see the space is kept up well and has a substantial wine collection. I can't comment on that since I've always thrown all my money into food and sometimes a thai tea. Their signature cuisine is northern Thai, and while I don't have other cuisine from that region to compare it to, it is delicious. That said, so are the more traditional dishes. The orange chicken, which was good during the lunch buffet, is outstanding when made to order. The pineapple fried rice has a great depth of flavor and is well-seasoned. Anything with crispy duck is excellent. The last time we had a northern Thai shrimp curry that was top notch. If you're not picky, just give the server some general parameters and they'll take care of it for you. You want a curry, pineapple rice, and crispy duck dish? Say no more. I haven't had something for dinner yet that I felt was ""meh."" The only problem, if you can call it that, is that the menu is huge which can make it tough to decide but on the other hand always provides some room to explore.

We would have walked the ~1.5-mile distance from Circus Circus, but it was unseasonably wet (and cold) outside. We gave up and took a taxi, which set us back by about $15 round trip, including tip. Our taxi driver asserted that the shopping center that the Lotus of Siam is situated in is the first shopping center in Vegas. I haven't fact-checked him, but it did seem like it'd been around for quite some time, especially the funky parking and overall traffic layout.

Jon A. and I picked out three dishes (with the help of our server), and I opted to try the Thai lime drink. The dishes included a bowl of Tom Yum Plar Dook (hot and sour soup with catfish, lime juice, lemongrass and straw mushrooms), roasted duck curry, and beef Khao Soi (Northern Thai egg noodles in curry sauce and coconut cream with your choice of beef or chicken, served with a side of with sliced red onions, lime, and pickled vegetables). Including Jon's soft drink, we ended up $45 lighter, including tax and tip.

Everything was delectable, but we suspected that they may have mixed up our spice-level orders. Jon's spiciness tolerance level is much higher than mine, so we ordered the communal soup and my roasted duck curry as a six, and the Khao Soi was to be a ten. However, after profusely sweating through the catfish soup and hoping I'd be able to handle my curry, we realized that the soup was probably the ten and the entrees both ended up sixes. Oh, well: everything was delicious, and I'd go back and order that soup at a ten again. The heat from both temperature and spiciness really hit the spot! And the Thai lime drink? Well, it was a little too sweet for my tastes, but it was nice to cool off with while working on that soup.

Don't expect much from the atmosphere, but that hardly matters. The crowds spoke by filling up the place by 7:30 PM on a Thursday evening. (Luckily we arrived before the swarms did. And the swarms had a wait of 45 minutes when we were leaving.) The service is pretty good for an Asian restaurant, but don't expect utter perfection.

However, my last two visits held a few disappointments; I consider Nam Kao Tod to be one of the world's truly great dishes and almost always order it at LOS. The last two times I ordered Nam Kao Tod it was not the incredible, compelling, best thing I ever ate dish that it always was before, it was just OK. Another favorite, the Garlic Prawns were not prepared as carefully as usual and the portion size was HALF of what we were served before, other dishes also seemed to be served in smaller portions. I hope the problems were kitchen anomalies that do not become permanent. 

The smaller portions are more troubling, no one deserved a James Beard award more than Saipin but I hope that isn't the reason for the smaller portions and much higher prices..

No one in the group was a fan of the pad thai. There was something different about it, the color was much darker almost as if they had added some sort of tomato paste (guessing). But everything else was fantastic.

The highlight for me was the thai dishes I had never seen before. There was a short rib in some very spicy orange sauce (forget the name exactly) which was absolutely superb and I will get it EVERY time I return. It is simply fantastic. We also had a unique seabass dish which was good on its own, but great with some other spicy sauce that was served with the dish.

Recommendation: The beef noodle soup is the most bomb soup I've had ever. So flavorful - especially with the different herbs, including cilantro. The beef is also extremely tender and delicious, and the noodles - thick rice noodles - go so well with the beef. I had about 3 bowls...soooo good.

The Pad Thai was also very good. The greasiness was not overwhelming like a lot of pad thai could be. The spicy-ness level was perfect - I always hate it when they assume that people can't take spicy-ness and make it mild and boring. The noodles were also nice and chewy, just like how I love my pad thai. 

The red curry chicken is also pretty delicious, as well as the fried bananas. The rest of the offerings were good but not great, but make sure you eat the the beef noodle soup, pad thai and red curry chicken.

The price is also extremely reasonable - only $11 for the lunch buffet!",3,0,2

It is partially my fault.  Going against everything sacred about my fooding skills, we opted for the lunch buffet instead of ordering off the menu.  It wasn't a matter of cost, more a matter of variety.  I thought this would be the best way for us to try a plethora of dishes and see what the restaurant had to offer!  FAIL.

There were a couple of items that were very good, the tom  yum soup was spicy, fragrant and steaming with deliciousness.  Everything else available was slightly subpar, from the dried out, overcooked chicken wings (not spicy at all by the way) to the pad thai that simply tasted like stir fried rice noodles.  I was disappointed.  There was a really yummy egg omelet with tomatoes and onions that i could've eaten alone with just steamed rice-but that shouldnt be the highlight for a place like this.

I definitely hit a couple of them and they were good but I am always one to seek out the spots off the beaten track. No matter where I did my research the one restaurant that kept coming up was Lotus of Siam. Some reviews have called it the best Thai restaurant in America. I've been to Thailand and I love Thai food so needless to say I was excited. When I called to make reservations I was told that they could only be made one day in advance. So we ended up going somewhere else but made a reservation for the following day. When we got there I was already excited. It's in a run of the mill strip mall and there was already a line out the door. We got there 20 minutes early and still had to wait 25 minutes after our original reservation time. However, this did not bother us because we were told to go to the bar and have a drink. When we finally got seated I was a little overwhelmed with all of the options. That being said as long as you make clear to your server what you like and don't like they will make sure to find something for you.  There were a couple of dishes that I tried that you would be insane not to. My top three favorites were the green papaya salad, the spicy drunken noodles with sea bass and crispy duck with pa nang curry. Every dish was perfectly balanced, very fresh ingredients, spice level was right on and the flavor was undeniably delicious.  I have not eaten at Pok Pok or some of the other famous Thai restaurants around the country but this is officially my favorite. If you're stopping in Vegas I feel like this is truly a must.

It's off the beaten path in a pretty suspicious plaza. This place is always busy, we got there ten minutes before they opened on a Sunday for dinner and there was at least twenty people in line. It's totally worth any wait though.
They have an impressive wine selection (a lot of rieslings) and everything on their menu is great. I always go with the Pineapple fried rice, spice level 8. It's so flavorful and the pineapple adds the appropriate amount of sweetness to offset the spiciness. A great appetizer is the crispy rice or the garlic wings. Seriously, you need to get the wings. The fried garlic is mouthwatering and the wings are so crispy.

While yes, the authenticity of the Thai food served is authentic and tasty. The price for the portions served along with the service are not. 

Overpriced with small portions and a server stealing your change is NO GO for me. 
Simply put, I've been to authentic Thai places that serve more food and at half the price. I'll admit it might not be AS good as Lotus of Siam, but for those that aren't foodies or even tasted authentic Thai food, you won't ACTUALLY notice the difference except for the hype. 

18% gratuity is automatically added for large parties.
Though I don't necessarily agree with this, if the service is at least decent I won't complain. 

However, if they don't return the change (even if it were only $3) after an automatically added tip, this is absurd. 

As a bonus, after our waiter took the check, he ignored my table for 10-15 minutes until I gave up and left. I was with a big party and needed to leave.

Thanks Ming Tsai for telling the world that the best thing you've ever eaten in Las Vegas is the Nam Prik Ong from Lotus of Siam.  I just had to try what the heck this man was talking about! My husband says Lotus of Siam is legendary in town. Well, I hadn't heard of it until Ming Tsai. 

Located in the not so flattering neighborhood of Las Vegas, I was surprised at how many patrons were there at 2pm! We were doing late lunch and was hoping to scarf as much by closing time at 2:30. I was intrigued to find that people were still filing in at this time.  

The waiting area is compact and uncomfortable.  We waited about ten minutes until our party was called. We found the restaurant busy and bustling when we were finally seated.  The restaurant has space in contrast to the narrow entrance and waiting area.  I was pleasantly surprised to see an entire wall of wine in what seemed to be a temperature controlled cellar.  There was a lunch buffet which we did not care for at that time.

Our server was nice and friendly and guessed correctly at my reason for ordering Nam Prik Ong.  Needless to say, I had the Nam Prik Ong while my buddy ordered Khao Soi (egg noodles in curry coconut sauce with bits of chicken). 

Verdict: Ming Tsai must have not had a lot of opportunity to eat in town.  Nam Prik Ong was good, but I wouldn't call it the best thing I've ever eaten in Las Vegas! I have to admit it is unique and I will probably not see this dish on the menu of any other Thai restaurant.  The Khao Soi was good too.  Based on the two orders we had, did I have a ridiculously spectacular dining experience? The answer is, eh. The size of the menu however allows for Thai food education that your favorite Thai delivery place will most likely not provide.",1,0,1

""It's the best Thai food you'll ever have,"" they said. 

Don't believe the hype.

I visited Lotus of Siam with a small group of co-workers while in Sin City for a business trip. We arrived at the restaurant promptly at 8:20 to be told our table wasn't ready although the reservation was made months in advance. Nonetheless, we patiently waited because ""it would be worth it."" 45 minutes later, a table finally opened up. 

By this time we were all hangry and quickly ordered our food. An array of appetizers were ordered for the table along with entrees for each person (5 total). On top of waiting 45 minutes to be seated, even though we had a reservation, two of our entrees never came! We politely advised 3 different members of the waitstaff about the missing dishes, and watched as surrounding tables continued to receive their orders of Garlic Prawns and Pad Thai before us. Sadly, the 2 dishes never came...and the employees could care less. We didn't receive a single apology and even felt rushed to vacate the table. 

The food that we did receive was nothing to rave about in my opinion. I ordered the Khao Soi as an entree (I've had this dish before in other top-rated Thai restaurants) and was not impressed with their curry broth or noodles. The broth did not have much flavor and just tasted like coconut milk while the noodles were mushy and tasted overcooked.

To sum it all up, my experience at Lotus of Siam was disappointing. The food was mediocre at most and the service was sub-par. Honestly, I believe this could have been a five-star dining experience once upon a time, but now it's merely a tourist trap.

I came here on a Thursday night at 8:45pm with two of my friends. They were pretty busy but not packed and we were able to get seated immediately.

It was an interesting place; in the middle of the restaurant they had a huge wine selection concealed behind a glass wall. Additionally like a lot of popular asian restaurants there always seems to be more Americans than asian patrons. 

Anyways... after we were seated our server Jim, (I don't think that was his real name), was a phenomenal guy. He must have been working there for a while because he knew everything and anything about the menu! Jim made some great recommendations from the menu and always checked back to see if we were doing fine.

Overall it wasn't a bad experience. I would rate this place 3\/5 but we ended up finding hair in the drunken rice and that was an immediate red flag. Especially the way the server had handled the issue. Our other server, (not Jim), wasn't even sure how to go about it. His first response was to bring us a new plate; we pretty much had to send back the entire dish until they removed it from our check.

We ended up spending $44 for 3 people. (That was after the drunken rice was taken off of our bill).

Lotus of Siam is definitely your typical mom & pop shop, there were handwritten ""out of order signs"" on paper place mats near the restrooms and you could clearly see the cleaning supplies in the restroom. Also the seating in the restaurant is a bit crowded, there's tables randomly scattered everywhere. You can literally place your arm on someone else's table if your not careful!

Tips: This place is a bit overhyped, the food isn't bad but it's like any other traditional Thai restaurant just with more reviews.",3,3,2

That is quite a recommendation, considering I am part Thai, my father was a Thai chef, and I travel all over Thailand frequently eating my way through the country :-)

It is crazy what you find in a nondescript strip mall off the Strip.  Other diners seemed to be enjoying the lunch buffet...when in Vegas, right?  We did look at the food offered on the buffet and it looked good, but after seeing some of the regional dishes that are not commonly available at most Thai restaurants, we had to bypass that.  

The tod mun pla (fish cakes, sometimes on the menu at Thai restaurants, but more often no) was very good.  The Khao Soi is not offered at very many places.  I can probably count on my hand how many of the thousands of Thai places I have eaten at had this on their menus.  It was phenomenal!  It was authentic to any of khao soi I have had in Chiang Mai and other parts of Thailand.  It was even served with the same garnishes.  The dish was bursting with flavors.  I was in heaven and would have gone back again for dinner that night if I didn't have other obligations.  My friend had the yellow curry and that was very good as well.  

The servers were attentive and good about refilling our water and checking to see that we were doing okay.  I complimented the chef and raved about the khao soi being as good as any I have had in Chiang Mai and was informed that the chef was from Chiang Mai, so it was great.  They looked like they had a solid wine list as well.  The other great part of the dining experience was the price.  It was $30 for two people with an appetizer, two entrees, and one Thai iced tea.

Service could be better, but the dining room is huge, actually there are several and the staff must be overwhelmed. The ambiance could be better, quite honestly the inside is completely unimpressive. The food is nothing short of amazing and that is why you must come here. 

The garlic prawns are memorable and delicious - cooked to perfection. Yes, they even fry up the prawn shells which seems weird, but they are edible and tasty the way they are prepared. 
We also shared the chicken satay which was very good but no the highlight here. 

The soft shell crab salad was yummy and the banana lumpia delicious (though missing ice cream).

Prices were reasonable, and we had very little wait, but the people who came shortly after weren't so lucky. My best recommendation is that if you do not have reservations, get there within 10 minutes of opening or be prepared to wait, and wait.",1,0,0

After making reservations for a Thursday evening, they told us they would only hold the reservation for 5 minutes because they are that busy.  Okay.

We were a party of six - four adults and two kids.  

* Chicken Dumplings ($6.95) -   Basic deep fried wontons with chicken and vegetables and served with a sweet chili sauce.  This order was mostly to satisfy the kiddies.

* Our friend recently had a Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad ($13.95) at another Thai place and wanted to try their version.  When he saw the presentation, he was immediately disappointed.  The pieces were a bit larger than he would have hoped and it was just an okay salad taste-wise.

* The Husband was certain about one dish in particular - the Crispy Duck Curry.  (He loved it before and that's all he could remember.)  When the waiter heard this, he insisted we order the Crispy Panang Curry instead and assured us we would LOVE it.  (It also cost $20.95.)  I asked him if he was certain we really would and he said yes.  We thought it was just alright...and not really worth the $21 cost of it especially.  Sure, it was tasty but I've had better panang curry in Vegas for a fraction of the price.

* We also opted for something from the Chef Specials - the Red Snapper.  Sure, it was a whole snapper at market price, which ended up being $35.  Our friend couldn't believe it when he discovered how much they charged for it.

When the waiter initially took our order, he asked what our spice level choice was.  We wanted the salad and curry mild since the kids would be eating it.  However, it was far from mild and we were unable to serve it to the children.  As we neared the conclusion of our meal, we wanted to add another dish.  We asked the waiter for some suggestion and he mostly focused on things from the Chef Specials that were market price or didn't appeal to us.  We ultimately decided we were done with the meal.  

I did take a quick peek at the dessert menu hoping for a saving grace but there was nothing exciting on there and our visiting friends were done with their Lotus experience at this point.

Overall, it was a disappointing visit.  Sure, they have all the fame they could ever want but it just leaves us wanting more. Maybe we ordered all the wrong dishes?  We probably won't be coming back here anytime soon.",9,1,1

It seemed fortuitous because I saw the show one month before a planned visit to Vegas. After going there with three other foodies, we all agree that it's a must-stop while visiting Vegas! We went there for lunch, and the large restaurant was full within 30 minutes of opening.

We decided to order some of the dishes we saw in the show that were from the Northern section of the menu. The Khao Soi with pork was delicious and had very tender pork with vegetables in a curry sauce with coconut milk and noodles. We also tried the Nam Prik Ong, which is a pork and tomato mixture served with fresh veggies and pork rinds for dipping. It was much better than I expected! The star of the show, however, was the Garlic Prawns! This absolutely delicious dish consists of large shrimp that are deep fried with the shell and topped with a fantastic garlic sauce. It sounds unusual, but the shell is supposed to be eaten, and the way that it's prepared makes it almost like a shrimp chip. We liked the Garlic Prawns so much that we ordered a second dish! 

It's true that Lotus of Siam is located far from the Vegas Strip in a remote area, but it's worth traveling to! It can take a while for cabs to come pick you up when called, so I suggest waiting to snag a cab that's dropping off someone instead. I'm already anticipating my return to this excellent restaurant the next time I'm in Vegas!",4,0,1

It's very clear that all these chefs are blown away by every dish at the table, so before the show was even over I was bookmarking Lotus of Siam on yelp for a future trip.  It helped even more, when I booked a Vegas trip with a friend and the first thing out of his mouth was, ""We must eat at Lotus of Siam.""

My advice is to explore the menu in advance, there are so many wonderful sounding dishes, that you can be overwhelmed if you wait until you sit down.  So get a game plan in order because there are 167 dishes on the menu.  We heard the Northern Thai dishes are very special here and you don't get them in most Thai restaurants in the US.  First up was the Sai Oua - Northern Sausage.  This was a pork sausage with some kick to it.  I liked pairing it with some of the crunchy veggies on the plate for some contrast and it also mellowed out the spice a bit.  We were going to compare this with an order of the Issan Sausage, but our waiter told us not to bother, since it would be no contest. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#rJOafb9EviIxvHmuRImkTA

Nam Prik Ong was featured once on ""The best thing I ever ate"".  So you know I had to try it.  It's a very tasty Northern ground pork based red chili tomato sauce dip and not very spicy, but packed full of flavor.  It's served with all kinds of crunchy veggies to spread on as well as a few pork rinds.  I will most likely order this every time I go back.  Works well as an appetizer and unique to this restaurant. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#w0R40SdZ1M2T6vi_nL7ioQ

A yelper friend of mine, Anita L., bragged about the Nua Nam Tok.  Our waiter warned us that this was a cold dish as some people are surprised.  Well it wasn't actually served cold, but slightly warm at room temperature.  The beef is coated in rice powder which gives it an unusual texture.  The flavor of the sauce was very strong and similar to a Nam Sod, heavy on the lime flavor.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#QwdrDHXlRPQY1CXH6XvNQA

We felt obligated to get a few standard Thai dishes as a place of reference.  Tom Kah  Kai is a soup that most people are very familiar with.  Lotus of Siam's version was very spicy and if you slurp it up the wrong way, it will get your eyes watering.  I love spicy, so no problems with me.  What I liked about this version was that the lemongrass flavor wasn't lost in the coconut milk at all. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#YZAR3oSugi4fd6bammVMzg

My buddy loves Pad Thai (as most people do).  I'm not that fond of the dish, but I will say I'm glad that I got to try it here.  Perhaps I've had so many bad versions of it, that I'm jaded.  This was by far the best Pad Thai that I've ever had.  I would order it again in a second.  We had it with Chicken. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#9UnnMrrfaKk53Uuv-pPyuQ

Last up was a Green Curry with Beef.  I love green curry and I love it spicy.  I was asked on a scale of 1 to 10.  I went with a 8.  Lke most things in Vegas; it was fun at the time, but I paid dearly for it the next morning.  It was very spicy and whatever they spiced it up with was green, because other places I've seen all kinds of ground up red chili in there, not in this curry.  Glad I had plenty of rice to soak up this delicious sauce http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#tQBHtC3JR05nKHCMFp-PaA  

Yes Lotus of Siam, should be on your must do list of Vegas.  I would make reservations, as it gets crowded.  We were seated promptly at our 8:30 reservation time on a Friday night.  Others who didn't think ahead had to wait.  The restaurant is much larger than it looks from the outside and has most likely expanded a few times, taking over their former next door neighbors.

Issan cooking is my favorite type of Thai fare and the dishes we ordered proved that the northern style dishes clearly won over the more traditionally Thai ones.

I've eaten Thai for decades now, in Thailand, in various countries in Asia, in north America and Australia. I can honestly say, this is THE best Thai meal I've had, hands down, outside of Thailand.

We had a huge array of dishes and my favorites were:

Issan sausage -- these had great texture and the sauce wasn't overly sweet

Pad Kee Mow -- the best I've ever had! the perfect amount of greasiness and spiciness. The noodles were slippery just the way they're supposed to be

Chili and Mint Duck -- this surprised all of us. The portion was small but the crispy rice on the bottom was enough to send us off the edge -- it was THAT good

Nuer Nam Tok -- a version of grilled beef but with toasted rice sprinkled all over giving the sauce a thick consistency which clung to the meat. Absolutely divine.

Lotus has had a few slight ups and downs in that time, mostly in regards to speed of service. In spring of this year they apparently hired a ton of new wait\/server staff, and they are a young professional crew who do a fantastic job. The half dozen or so times  I've been there this summer the service level has been exemplary. Their cuisine is the most consistently delicious of any restaurant I've ever dined in, including dozens of michelin starred and james beard nominated. The best kept secret of Lotus' menu is the deep fried Lobster. It's always at least 5 lbs and runs $145 per, must call ahead to order or inquire as to the availability of Lobster. It's deep fried in the shell, then cut in sections and pan fried with corn starch sauce and veggies. The result is moist, flavorful lobster meat that comes out of the shell in perfect huge chunks! It wan't until about a year ago that my wife and I first had the lobster, we asked on a flyer on a monday night and they sold us one that was leftover from a party they night before. I guess they pre-ordered 10 and only ate 9, so we ordered it for just the two of us. There was a big party of about 20 ppl in the adjacent room and they came over in shifts to take pictures of our lobster, it's really that much of a spectacle!

Crispy fried, garlicky salt sweetness actually makes the shell into a chip like snack almost. Everything else pales in comparison. I recommend sticking with the classic salads, pad thai and tom yum soup. I once or twice I veered off course and was a little disappointed. The curry without coconut milk tasted like a tom yum soup. I probably wouldn't be disappointed if they called it a soup rather than a curry. Their beef soup is more or less flavored for the white man's taste buds. Considering two people can only eat so much, I wish I tried something else. It was like a very sweet pho.

The place is pretty big and we were seated with the sit down side and noticed that more people do that than buffet. Overall, the food is pretty authentic but too bad we werent able to explore more of the authentic dishes.

Garlic prawns- These bad boys are quite expensive at $22 but they are fried and yummy. I couldnt help but eat the fried shell as well. They werent spicy and did have some flavor to it but I did have a tummy ache after all the fried stuff. I say if you are a fan of seafood, then go ahead and give it a try. Since I am not an avid fan of it, I could have easily passed on it and tried an entree but my yelper self had to try.

Nam Kao Tod- This is an appetizer that Yelp told me to get. I would not reorder this. It is fried crispy rice pieces that have a sour lemon taste to it. I do not particularly like the flavor and it is not something I would ever crave. I would pass.

Tofu pad see ew- Average and nothing special about it. I liked the veggies in it though.

Mango sticky rice+ coconut ice cream- These are sold separately but they put them on the same plate. This dish is always awesome and it tastes like the others I have tried. The sticky rice isnt that sweet which is nice because you have the mangoes and ice cream with it.

We arrived pretty hungry and ordered right away. Both hubby and our friend went for the Chicken Pad Thai. While my hubby thought it was just as good as others he'd had, our friend thought it was better than most she's tried here in Vegas. I did think it was strange that the waiter didn't ask what spice level she wanted and just assumed none. Whereas my husband specifically requested a 4\/10 (which he found to be pretty mild). 

I ordered the Yellow Curry with chicken. While the amount of chicken they gave was generous, I found the overall portion to be smaller than I've had. 

We finished our entrees still hungry, so we ordered some Fried Chicken Dumplings. The dumplings were fine. I felt it was the sweet and sour sauce that really made it yummy.

I went to Vegas for my birthday weekend and one of my best friends raved about Lotus of Siam and encouraged me to go. So I went first thing I arrived and had my first dinner there. We ordered the stuff everyone raved about for our first dinner -- and I was beyond unimpressed. In fact, I didn't like a single one of the dishes. One of the dishes everyone said was a ""must order"" (Nam Kao Tod, aka crispy rice with sausage) I thought was awful. It was too salty, the rice was not crispy at all, and there was no actual flavor to distinguish that made it taste good.

The other ""must order"" (and is the cover photo on their home page) is the Garlic Prawns. They didn't suck but anything fried is pretty good as long as it's fresh. Unfortunately, they were dimensionless in flavor and had very little prawn meat (it was mostly fried shell and was overpriced).

And lastly, because they're known for their Northern Thai dishes (which is hard to find in the US) and because I love jackfruit, we ordered the Kang Ka Joon (spicy young jack fruit curry) -- what I thought would be a curry turned out to be a tangy clear broth soup and the jackfruit was ""off""in texture and the flavor was just ... flat.

We were beyond disappointed and the wait staff never came back to check in on us after delivering our food. We didn't want to throw the towel on the first go, so we went back on our last day to have our last meal (lunch) there. When we went back for our last lunch we decided to just stick with some classics: Pad See Ew, Green Curry Chicken, and Green Papaya Salad. We asked for the salad to be mild but it came out so flaming hot that they had to remake it for us. We asked for a 2 on a scale of 1 to 10, and they brought us a 10. The other two dishes were just fine. A solid B, but not something I would consider as ""the best Thai in North America."" I love Jonathan Gold (the food writer for the LA Times) to pieces and his reviews are usually spot on, but I have to say that I would never go out of the way to go back to Lotus of Siam because I have had such good Thai all over the country (especially in Southern California and in New York City).

And I wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way to go there, either. But if you're in Vegas and you have your own car and you're hankering for Thai food, this might be your best\/only option. Otherwise, it's not worth the hype or the wait. Just go if there's no line or wait. Fortunately, we only waited 15 minutes for our dinner and for lunch we just walked in.

I really wanted it to work out but honestly, it was just kind of meh. It's really too bad.",0,0,0

Since I live on the other side of town so prefer Archi and even after solid Thai food at Lotus of Siam still would take Archi. I went with big group there was 9 of us in all. So best part about that was did I get too try everything and the kitchen sink. Believe had over ten different dishes in all so just going too pick out the ones that stood out for me.

The crispy duck pagnang was very very good. The crispy duck something that could have had whole dish of by itself. It had the perfect crispy crust that crunch every time and still meat is moist. You combine it with sauce over rice. Fabulous! We had four different types of noodles from the traditional pad thai too other ones on menu gear more toward certain regional style. The pad thai was solid. Lo mein type of noodle really enjoyed because not normal one orange in color and tasty noodle. The pineapple fried rice was ok different but not something would order again. Green Papaya Salad had nice spicy kick too it. Solid choice. The winner for me was the FRIED BANANAS. Bananas wrapped in lumpia wrapping deep fried too perfect crispy brown and felt like hogging them all too myself. 

The location is one less then desirable part of town. It amazing never judge book by its cover. You walk into the place really small hallway too all sudden opens too restaurant hold over or close too 100 people. They had nice wine cellar that see lot of the win on the menu, It become popular cult almost they have pictures all famous people that have dined there on the walls. If run out of conversations look around guess who who on the walls. The menu is pretty massive in choices. So sure there is something there appeals too everyone.

A little far off from the rest of the places you will visit during a trip to Vegas but worth the short drive.  It is located near Sarhara in a deserted shopping center near Downtown.  I don't see any other reason to drive out here other than to eat here.  Parking is simple with the huge lot and plenty of parking since this is the only place that seems lively...

There might be a wait if you come during a busy time.  We came around noon and had to wait for around 20 minutes...(even though there were open tables...)  But I think I understand why they did that.  Unfortunately, the kitchen is quick but not quick enough to meet the demand and having people wait in line might be better than having them wait for food.

So was Anthony Bourdain and all the other celebrities (pictures all around the restaurant) just joking or is this place the real deal?

Order the garlic prawns! At around $30, it is pricey for 7 pieces of prawns but it was the best dish we had.  Not overly garlic-y and cooked perfectly so to not burn the garlic.  The prawns are huge and butchered perfectly so that you can devour the entire prawn (shell and all).

Order the Nua Nam Tok (Beef Salad with crushed toasted rice).  The beef was moist and fattier than other Thai restaurants I have had this dish at.  The fat was the difference.  Even though I prefer lean meats, the fat made the beef tender and flavorful.  The sauce was salty, sour, and spicy at the same time with a mixture of greens and a slice of cabbage.

Skip the Crispy Duck with Drunken Noodles or just order the drunken noodles by itself.  The crispy duck wasn't that crispy with our duck fat still not fully rendered.  The duck was not worth the premium to make this dish around $30.  Without the fat rendered out, it was similar to BBQ duck from a Chinese BBQ place...  As for the noodles, they were fried well with a layer of sauce on them.  The portion was a bit small.   Might be bigger without the crispy duck.  Finish the noodle quickly or they start to clump together.

This place is worth the visit.  I want to try the other items on the menu since they specialize in Northern Thai cuisine.  Will be coming back for the garlic prawns.  Beware of the wait for a table and then the wait for your food but if you have the time, it's a must try.  Just ask the other 3000 reviewers.",3,3,4

I got the cod, I believe it was black cod, steamed on top of steamed cabbage with a spicy pepper sauce on the side.  This was a pretty healthy dish, fish on cabbage I skipped the rice.  He got the duck in a panang curry.  These were huge pieces of duck, easily split this entree.  The duck was seasoned well and crispy from pan frying.  The curry was very good, and medium was a good level of pepper.  They were out of the mango with sticky rice, so we split the coconut ice cream.  The ice cream tasted homemade, chunks of coconut in it.

It really interested us, being originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, where there's also a huge diversity in food. 
We went for lunch on a weekday. It was pretty packed, but we were seated right away by friendly staff. Our waitress was initially pretty cold with us (I'm sure she was just having a rough day), but warmed up quickly and was very friendly.
The menu is HUGE. We wanted at least one Northern Thai menu item because we'd never explored it -- and Anthony Bourdain told us to. So we had the Khao Soi (recommended by our waitress) and a Panang curry as a 'safety' item. Both dishes were beyond expectations!! Absolutely delicious and rich in flavor! Portions are a good size, so we ended up taking quite a bit of leftovers, even having ordered just two dishes.

Looking at the menu, dishes were on the pricey side. Then I saw too many westerners to think this would be any good. While we waited, we watched dishes coming out and the portions looked tiny. The garlic prawns were $29! And the plate didn't even look that full.

It's located in a shady strip mall on Sahara, near Maryland, actually really near the Green Door, if that tells you anything about the neighborhood.  Look it up.

The food beyond makes up for the area, though.  We shared the spicy Thai wings, which were amazing.  I had the roasted duck curry with a heat level of 6 (out of 10), and it was like I died and went to curry heaven.  Le sigh.

I'm a big fan of all things spicy, and I thought the 6 was just about perfect.  Hot enough to make me sit up and notice, but not so hot I couldn't taste the delicious curry and duck.  I could've probably handled a 7 or 8, but I would've had tears in my eyes.

Hands down, this is some of the best Thai food I've had.  Ever.  And I eat a lot of Thai food.

Oddly enough, they actually have a great wine list, so if you're interested in that, it's a cool experience.   It makes dinner a bit pricey (for Thai food), but it's a nice addition.

Lotus of Siam has the best lunch buffet in Vegas, hands down.  Not because the buffet specials change daily (although tasty variety is nice); not because the ginger tofu dish is tart and spicy in a way that you know they are using fresh ginger; not because the fried sweet potato curry puffs have made me ditch my diet more than once (although, I could honestly pig out on a plate full of those things--crunchy and sweet with a dash of spice . . . mmmmmmm).

No, it's because each dish under the heat lamp is fresh.  In contrast to most of the buffets in Vegas, Lotus of Siam does not leave their buffet dishes under heat lamps for hours.  Each dish is fresh.  Hell, there's not much chance for the dishes to sit for long since the place is always packed for lunch and the kitchen needs to keep cranking out food to refill the buffet options.  

Oh, and the buffet dishes are properly cooked.  An overcooked chicken can ruin a Pad Thai, but you won't find that here.  It's tender, it's seasoned and it's wonderful.

And they do a good job of catering to the full spectrum of spice lovers.  The dishes on the buffet aren't overly spicy, but there's plenty of hot sauce and dried hot pepper to stir in if you want to raise the heat level.

All around thumbs up.",3,1,2

I always ordered my Pad Thai with less sweet because most places dump a bucket load of sugar into this dish. No exception here. I specifically asked for less sugar but it came out a lot sweeter than I had asked. I just don't get it. Most other dishes I ordered are too sweet for my preference.

When we were done and the waiter was not around, I went up to the cashier to pay. The young cashier girl told me to go back because apparently only the waiter could give me my check. House rules?

Unfortunately, I could not get reservations until after 9 pm.  After looking through trusty Yelp, we found Lotus of Siam, which lives up to its four stars.

VENUE
Lotus of Siam looks like a dive bar. You're greeted with neon lights in the front and a bar with concrete floors and TVs right when you walk in. But don't let this trick you because this is actually a restaurant too! And Lotus of Siam serves GREAT food. The seating arrangements are a little odd-- between the bar and the host area, there are four or five dinner tables, so you have to squeeze into your table. There's a lot more room in the back, but we didn't sit in the back room area.

FOOD (4.5\/5)
Interestingly, the menu is on the little 4""x6"" folding card that you'll find on your table. At first I thought it was their happy hour menu or advertisement, but then I realized that the entire menu was on one side of the folding card. Although the selection isn't vast, you'll find plenty of entrees to keep your tummy happy.  Lotus of Siam will have all the familiar Thai dishes-- pad thai, drunken noodles, Tom Yum Koong soup, shaking beef, papaya salads, stir fry vegetables, fried bananas for dessert, coconut and brown rice and curry. I think we ordered pretty much everything, and we were very satisfied. 

SERVICE (5\/5)
SO good! Most of the restaurant staff were young and they were all very gracious and helpful.  We had a large party, and they were always ready to help clear dishes, make more room (our table was small for the quantity of food we ordered), bring extra silverware and napkins, and keep our drinks refilled. They were happy to help take as many pictures as we requested, and they always kept their cool even though they were busy and dealing with a lot of food orders.",8,5,7

I tried a few of new dishes, based on fellow Yelpers, hoping to rant about them, as they did: the spicy chicken wings, the crispy duck in panang, and the beef jerky.  The spicy chicken wings are dripping and delicious.  The duck was good, but we thought that the short ribs in panang (from our last visit) was better.  The jerky was reminiscent of Filipino tapa, but less tangy.

Again, we had the garlic prawns.  Wow!  You can put them damn things in the freezer and bake them the next day to the same yummy goodness.  This time the seabass on drunken noodle was good, but the fish was as crisp and juicy as our first endevour.  

I do have to note that we did ""take out"" this time around.  I don't know if that made a difference on the quality.  They gave us a 40 minute wait time.  We got there at exactly 40 mins, but it took them another 10 minutes to complete our order, once we arrived.",2,0,0

Ambiance: Very bright indoor lighting. Tables are tightly packed. Not kid friendly (-1 star).

Table Service: They have a very strange zone set up. The water boy for our table was excellent (+1 star). Very attentive. Never let our cups go dry. Our waiter, however, was spread too thin.

The first time I went, it felt weird.  It's in a strip mall, there was a bunch of broken window glass in the parking lot, and it felt kinda seedy.  But, the food.  Oh, the food.  I'd read that Gourmet magazine called it the best Thai restaurant in America, and I had sky-high expectations.

They were exceeded.

There's a neat twist, too.  In addition to all the dishes you think of as ""Thai"" (which are from the southern part of Thailand), they have a whole set of Northern Thai specialities.  If you think you know Thai food, only order from the part of the menu with the northern specialties.  It's Thai, but it's nothing you'll recognize unless you're really well traveled and know Thai food extremely well.

We called and could not get a reservation. So this year, before arriving to CES 2012 I made sure we called in two weeks ahead for reservations to take my team there.

We arrived at the restaurant which was large and packed.  Excitement was building by everyone.  We ordered a recommended beef salad, the Tom klong soup (similar to Tom yum Kai but recommended by our waitress), Padang chicken, yellow Curry chicken, chop suey and the highly recommended garlic prawns.

Well...  I have had Thai in many places and unfortunately this experience was not up there.  The recommended beef salad had a thick sauce, reminded me of Chinese style dish.  Not that good.  The soup was good and so was the chop suey (which also seemed more Chinese than Thai).  Nothing wrong but we were expecting more Thai cuisine.  The panang was ok.  The yellow curry was good. And the garlic prawns were nice, but as someone else noted the portion was small in comparison to the price.

In conclusion, we left the place wondering why it was rated 4 stars.  I would rate the food 3 stars and would give our waitress 4 stars for great service.

The food didn't really taste much different from most Thai restaurants I've been to, but it was very overpriced. After ordering the fried red snapper which was on the menu for $40, the waiter came back to our table 10 minutes later, and said that they could only prepare the snapper for us for $50 because it was the only one left and it was really big (he made a gesture with his hands that seemed to suggest that the fish was about 2 feet long). So I said okay, $50 was fine, just because we were on our honeymoon and we wanted to treat ourselves - we also didn't want to delay our food since we had already waited 10 minutes. So the guy went back to the kitchen, and about 20 minutes later, emerged with the illustrious snapper. I kid you not, the fish was nowhere close to the 2 feet gesture he had made with his hands. It was a small fish, not even a foot long - I would say at most, it was only 5 inches long, excluding the tail which you can't eat anyway. To make things worse, there was nothing special about the way the fish tasted; it was simply dipped into the frier and pulled out just like any other restaurant does it - the only thing that added a unique  flavor to it was the small sweet red sauce it came with on the side (I guess this is what we were paying $50 for? Lol).

 As we started eating the fish, we  realized how much we had been up-sold and ripped off - we essentially paid $50 for a small fish that would have otherwise  been worth about  $14  anywhere else. So in total, we ended up paying over $92 for 2 very small dishes, and an appetizer  (the fried chicken dumpling). 

One of the dishes was from the chef's special menu, and it was the khaoi saoi crispy duck curry (again, it had very little duck in it, and we paid almost $30 for it). 

If you're in Vegas and you are really craving Thai Food and you want to try this place out, my advise would be to stick to the items on the Northern menu, and make sure to go only for items that are around $10 (there's no difference in the size of the portions; $10 items, and $30 items, are all the same size - the only difference is in the types of spices they use - so if you are all about trying different flavors and not necessarily getting more bang for your buck portion-wise, then by all means go ahead and pay $30 for a $10 size dish).

Upon checking out all the Yelp reviews, we decided that we need to get the best three dishes.  Between the two of us, we could only stuff ourselves so much.  LOL.   The three winners were (and they truly were!) the garlic shrimp, crispy duck kang soi and soft shell crab drunken noodles.

Did we make the best choice!  The magnificently jumbo prawns were delicious.  I couldn't decide if I like the shrimp itself more or the fried shrimp shell!   Yes, you can and should and need to eat the shell entirely which is fried separately from the shrimp meat.  That was my fave of the three incredible dishes.

The drunken noodles with the soft shell crab were delightfully cooked.  The crab is fresh and lightly battered.  The noodles are moist but not oily.  We can eat pretty darn spicy but decided to go with only 6\/10 and it was perfect.  It was a bit spicy in the mouth without taking out the true flavor of the dish.

The last but certainly not the least dish was the duck kang soi.  The noodles below the crispy duck were soaked with the fat of the duck and the creamy yet light broth.  There were fried noodles on the side.  The combo of the three (duck, broth and noodles) gave it a nice complexity.

The prices are a bit steep and the total came out to be about $86.  But when you think about it, it is a very fair price to pay for the best Thai food I had in U.S.!",1,1,1

Brief Summary
-- Location is off the strip, felt like ""middle of nowhere""
-- Must be a Local hot spot because it's packed and busy!
-- Service was decent
-- Food was pretty good
-- Experience was just A-OK

With all of the high profile chef's having restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip or in the fancy, new hotels,  I would have NEVER thought of getting some Thai food in LV. Thanks to Yelp, I checked this place out with my GF and even called ahead and got a reservation on a busy Wednesday night!

This place doesn't look as big or as nice as it does inside. The outside made me feel like we were in the slums but the inside of the restaurant was very welcoming and nice. 

Service was a little bit slow at times but eventually our server opened up and gave us a smile and great customer service. I guess he just needed some time to warm up.

--- Our Order ---

** Tom Kha Gai with veggies -- I think this one of the best dishes of the night. We asked for medium heat, and they delivered! The heat was strong when you ate the peppers in the soup, but otherwise it wasn't completely overbearing or too much. We were a little surprised at first but then were relieved that our mouths weren't completely on fire. We got the Hot Pot size and it was $14 ( a little expensive ), but the portions were HUGE. So it made sense. I definitely recommend this coconut based soup with chicken and vegetables.

** Chicken Satay -- I like simple dishes. This dish was simple and delicious. BBQ chicken on skewers with a great peanut sauce and the cucumber salad. 

** Pad Thai with Chicken -- I'm not a fan of places that serve Pad Thai with ONLY a certain type of meat. I'm used to having some egg, chicken, tofu and shrimp in my noodles. So it would have been nice to have a few mroe ingredients, but in general the pad Thai was good. The noodles were a little bit thicker than what I like, but the flavor was very good. Pad Thai is the ""make or break"" dish for me, and I feel like they delivered well with the Pad Thai.

** Pineapple Fried Rice -- This was probably the weakest dish. It wasn't very ""fried"" but more like a rice mixed with curry powder. It made the rice have a lackluster texture that was in between moist and dry. It was confusing. The pineapple did deliver a nice fresh crunch and juice, but I've had better.

After going over my whole order, it wasn't that this place isn't good. Everything was good, but nothing WOW'd us or made me want to go out of my way for Thai in Las Vegas. If you're hankering for some Thai in LV, make a trip out here. Don't blink, or you'll miss it!

** Quick Side Note -- They have a HUGE selection of Wine. If that's your ""thing"" then they will definitely be able to get you something that fits your meal.",0,0,0

Service was incredibly efficient and nice; after ordering, the food came out in about 5 minutes. As many other people said, the portions are a bit smaller than other Thai\/Chinese restaurants but the quality is incredible.

Wine and beer menu was awesome.  If you stop in the lobby you can see the many ""honorable mentions"" and articles about them in magazines such as Food and Wine, Gourmet, Los Angeles Food, etc.  They have won two James Beard awards.

Trying to find the place-- we are tourists in Vegas-- we drove to the address in our rental car, and it looked like a place that NO ONE would dare enter... vacant, dirty, abandoned and horrible.  But alas, that was the back way.  The front is not much better, actually.  But it is in a strip mall (off the ""Strip"") with Japanese, Indian, Mexican and Karoake restaurants nearby.

Make a reservation - yes, they take them, and now via the website. 

Go with a group - 5 or 6 allows you to get a good variety.

Take their advice on what to order - especially that of the wonderful older woman that works behind the bar (most nights). 

Specific dishes that are especially amazing (like, best in the US amazing): tom kha kai soup, traditional pork larb, northern pork larb, beef salad, grilled prawns with garlic and lime, crispy duck with panang curry, beef short rib with masaman curry.

Same with plates. Floors weren't sticky or stained. Walls were clean. Bathroom was exceptionally clean. All this just added to how great the food tasted.

On a little side note, some of the dishes might be a little spicier than expected, as we personally discovered. Of course not super spicy if marked as mild, but be careful if you don't stand spicy much.

Don't be fooled by the exterior or the bad, kinda scary area the place is in. The food will change your mind!

You walk inside and its really nice, they have a huge space and wine selection. The servers here are so laser focused they give such good hospitality, they're so nice and give amazing service.  It's best to make reservations before you come otherwise you'll have to wait for 1 hour or longer. 

We ordered the Stuffed Chicken, Tom yum soup, Red curry, garlic prawns, and the pad thai. The stuffed chicken is nice and crispy and wasn't dry. It's served with sweet chilli sauce on the side and its very well balanced. The tom yum soup was all the elements of what a thai soup was supposed to be, sweet, sour, and savory. For those of you that can't take spicy foods too much, I suggest ordering anything that's spicy at the level 4 or lower. At a level 4 it feels like a level 8 and I occasionally eat spicy stuff. Garlic prawns were amazing and they fry the shell as well, everything is crunchy and they also devain the shrimp so you just get a nice big shrimp with a lot of garlic flavor. Red curry is good too like any other thai curry. The pad thai was really light and wasn't super sweet. You can taste sweet, sour, and savory but it's not like the super sweet pad thai noodles you'll get if you go to a thai restaurant back in LA.  Def order to share, and would come back next time to try the crispy duck :)

To top it off, the food was cold.  I also had the coconut ice cream with sticky rice and mangos and that was ok.

Then we ordered the Thai BBQ chicken and the classic Pad Thai. and OH MAN! The chicken had so much flavor and it was cooked to perfection. They used small noodles to make the pad thai which I had never seen before, but it didn't matter because the flavors were perfect. I ate until I was close to exploding.

A big restaurant clean inside that looks nothing like the horrible outside. Service is really attentive and makes sure your table is always clean. 

The food here was superb. Next time I come here I'm only ordering the specialty dishes. The typical dishes are great but they have such an awesome menu that every dish we got blew my mind. The tom yum kai soup is delicious and you can't go wrong with that. The pad thai they use thin noodles which made me like it even more! The sea bass drunken noodles was crack. The fish itself was so tender it was like butter. The green curry was another highligh that felt like eating coconut butter on top of rice. I couldn't get enough of it. The raw beef tar tar was light and fresh. The fried rice was good but probably the least memorable of the dishes. Next time I come here I'm getting the deep fried prawns.

When you arrive, you will think you are in the wrong place.  It's in a crazy seedy strip mall and at night I had trouble picking this restaurant out of the string of strange establishments.  It was so dark that I thought they were closed (none of the strip mall's neon lights were on), but then I saw an open sign.

Inside it is nicer.  Huge wine selection.  On the menu there is an entree specialty section priced in the +$20 range, but the standard menu has lots of options under $10.  My 3 friends and I got 4 entrees and two beers for under $50.

I may get crap for it, but I always order pad thai as a backup when at a new thai restaurant because it's usually edible, even if the other stuff you order is not.  Everything we ordered (cashew nut chicken, lemon pepper pork, yellow curry, pad thai) was great, but I was surprised that the pad thai was phenomenal. 

The guys in the group were scraping every last peppercorn off the dish.  I had to practically stop them from licking the plates!

There is a constant stream of cabs and line of people going in and out of the restaurant. I would definitely recommend making a reservation! Otherwise the wait can be over an hour!

The food was amazing. I love Thai food and definitely have my favorites that I typically ordered. On this occasion however, we chose to order outside of our normal dishes. Our server recommended the garlic prawns, duck panang, short ribs and sea bass with drunken noodles. It was all fabulous! I'm not usually a fan of the drunken noodles but these were delicious. Warning - if you do not like garlic do not get the prawns. I love garlic so these were perfect for me. They were so yummy!

But such a place does exist my friends. It's called Lotus of Siam - known to many as the best Thai restaurant in America for over a decade, and home to the culinary masterpieces of multiple-time nominee and 2011 James Beard award-winning chef Saipin Chutima. 

I first went to Lotus on my first trip to Vegas in 2008, after hearing continuous raves from my close friend and Yelper Jay F. They were already starting to get a buzz then, with one magazine proclaiming them the best Thai restaurant in America, and it's been great to see how the buzz has grown to Beard Awards and feature episodes on Top Chef Masters. A couple of weeks back was my first trip there in about four years, and it was nice to see that the restaurant has been expanded and renovated inside to better reflect it's reputation and quality cuisine. 

My friend and I arrived at close to 9PM on a Monday night. They close at 9:30, but true to Lotus form, they were PACKED and more were flocking in. We took a seat at the nice bar (new since I last visited) and was pleased to see a small but thoughtful selection of bottled beer (many people were enjoying Stone IPA) and a selection of sake. (Wine is the thing to come here for - they have an impressive selection and showcase their wine storage room prominently - but I'm just not a wine person.) Shortly after ordering and receiving my hot sake, we were called for our table. 

We started with 2 apps - the Issan Style Beef Jerky (13a) and Nam Ko Tod (14), which is essentially a crispy rice salad served with minced sour pork sausage and unlike anything I have ever had. Amazing. As always, we ordered both a 10 spicy, but felt these were a little lower - maybe a 7 in ""Lotus Spice"", which is equal to the ""10"" at most other places. 

For my entree, I decided to bypass the ""go to"" dishes I had tried in the past and went with a traditional Massaman curry. And that's the great thing about Lotus - they have a huge menu with some truly creative and unique offerings that will blow you away. But for the less adventurous, they offer the same traditional Thai dishes that you can get at any neighborhood Thai restaurant, and at the same price. The difference is that it is prepared by a highly decorated chef, and it will be the best version of the traditional Thai dish you have ever had. I'll put my neighborhood Thai restaurant in Manassas up against any Thai restaurant in America - except Lotus. This was, hands down, the best Massaman curry I have ever had. And this time, the 10 spicy was indeed a 10 ... several pitchers of water were needed. (And you certainly are reminded the day after that you indeed did order the ""10"")

If there is any issue with Lotus, it's that the service can be a little bit hit or miss. There was some confusion with the server, and my friend was served the wrong entree. However, after pointing this out, our server went back to the kitchen and produced the proper entree in minutes ... and it was spot on. They make mistakes, but they handle them properly and professionally. 

Lotus isn't just the best Thai in Vegas ... it's the best Thai in America, the best restaurant in Vegas, and one of the best restaurants in America. All at prices that are no more expensive than your typical Thai restaurant. Any foodie that's been to Vegas and hasn't been to Lotus can't call themselves a foodie or say they've really been to Vegas. It's THAT good.",2,1,3

Crispy duck curry - Curry is super creamy and delicious and the duck is crispy on the outside, while moist and flavorful throughout. A great dish. The problem? $24. I don't think I'd go down that road again. 

Khao Soi Beef- awesome little noodle dish. On spice level 7, it was hot enough to make me sweat a bit, but doesn't overwhelm. The noodles were long, the beef was tender and the curry was light, but packed a punch. A great combo.

The service was great and the people were so nice. I came here with a party of 9 and we had to wait about 40 minutes until we were seated. We had some time to look through the menu and figure out what we wanted to eat. Let's just say that we ordered the entire menu! Everything we ordered was really good except for maybe 2 dishes that I could have done without. 

Appetizers:
- Som Thum Papaya Salad: loved it!
- Tom Ka Kai (soup): Coconut milk with chicken and mushrooms. I could have done without this. There wasn't anything special about it. It was really really sour. I would much rather prefer the Tom Yum Soup

Entrees:
- Garlic Prawns
- Pad Thai
- Drunken noodle seafood
- Pineapple fried rice- Didn't have as much flavor as I expected =(
- Crab fried rice
- Chicken Red Curry
- Braised short ribs with panang- Amazing!! My favorite dish from here!
- Sea bass on drunken noodle
- Crispy duck w\/ chili mint leaves

When we rolled up, we had an awkward feeling about this place as the exterior seemed really dinky and the spaces around this strip mall have pretty much gone out of business. But as we saw people waiting around in the front for it to open....and asian, this was our good sign. It was like the moment Dorothy opened the front door to her house and stepped into Oz. They had seemed to done up the place really well and you really wouldn't have imagined it at its location.

It was pretty interesting as we sat down and literally had to flip through seven pages of the menu and absolutely had no idea what to order. The waiters were definitely honest with their suggestions. Their recommendations turned out to be some of the most unique flavors and tastes I've ever experienced.  I'm thinking that part of the reason why their food is so delicious is because they utilize their different flavors, textures, and consistencies so successfully.

We ordered the following:
Nam Kao Tod
Green Tofu Curry 
Sai Oua (Northern Style Sausage)
Drunken Noodles with Chicken
Nam Prik Ong with Sticky Rice (Red Chili Dip)
Coconut Ice cream with Fried Bananas 

Amongst my uncle, cousin and myself, it was definitely way too difficult to rank our favorites; and we kept adding on to our tab because it's one of those places where you want to literally try everything on the menu.

We also kept hearing people mention that they had redone the place, maybe for more room to hang their awards and pictures of celebrities.

Garlic Prawns (4 stars): This was good, but pretty pricey. Garlic-y and crispy. 

Crispy Duck with Panang Curry (4 stars): They don't give you much duck but it was good and the panang was good too.

Green curry (2 stars): Tasted very bland. Do not get this. 

I guess only a few things here are worth having. I wouldn't get the regular Thai food items because those are definitely not flavorful here.

Really big, tables are spaced out so you don't feel crowded. There are all these pics up of celebrities who came to the restaurant, but I didn't know more than half of them, haha. Waiting area in the front is crowded, and when you're done you feel the glare from the people waiting as you walk by hoping they get your table. The plaza it's in doesn't look like anything fancy.

After reading all the rave yelp reviews about this place, I was really looking forward to trying out some of their classic dishes -- garlic prawns and crispy duck -- but the food turned out nothing special: it was merely comparable to other neighborhood Thai restaurants yet came with a higher price tag (hence two stars instead of three). I guess they are relying on one-time customers for their business.

That said, I somewhat appreciated their Bangkok-style soup which has an interesting, complex flavor thanks to the combination of coconut milk, mushrooms, and lemongrass.

Overall, if you are looking for a reservation-worthy experience, I would recommend to look elsewhere...

As audacious a statement as this is, I don't think it's too far from the truth.  And people in the area seem to agree.  It can be difficult to get in on any given night.



If you can get in, I suggest you start out with the following:  


19. TOM YUM KUNG-Hot and sour with shrimp, lime juice, lemon grass & straw mushroom.  
(LEAPS AND BOUNDS BETTER than any Tom Yum you'll have ever tried before!)

Then order the delectable spicy charbroiled shrimp:  

52. CHARBROILED PRAWN-Topped with fresh chili, garlic and lime sauce. 
(Spicy flavors like nothing you've EVER tasted before!)



You will see exactly what I'm talking about.  

Move on to order anything from this magnificent menu which includes many Northern Thai \/ Issan dishes you don't often see anywhere else, and you will no doubt enjoy it.


This is easily the best Thai food I've ever had outside of Thailand...  and this maybe even includes food I've had IN Thailand.

I came in the other day with bae and some friends. The wait was about an hour at 8:40, and we finally got seated at around 9:50. The kitchen was going to close in 10 minutes, so we were encouraged to order quickly. We ordered boat noodle soup, duck panang, duck khao soi, garlic prawns, pad Thai, a soup dish, and another duck dish.

Minutes go by as previous tables get their order before us, and some of the non-duck dishes became present on our table. We shrugged at the thought that other tables seemed to get their appetizers before us, though we ordered prior to them. Our friends told us to just go ahead and eat, as they anticipated their food to arrive. 

As 30 minutes go by, and all but the duck dishes arrived, we inquired about the missing dishes. The time was already past 10pm, and the kitchen had closed. The given answer was that they ran out of duck, so my friends dishes weren't available to them, nor were they even given a heads up. 

After everyone had gotten their order but the friends who settled for duck, only AFTER WE INQUIRED were we even given an explanation. And by this time, the kitchen had closed so there was no other alternative but starve.

See this is where it gets unacceptable. A restaurant such as Lotus that is NOT a new establishment with thousands of customers  and (generally) good service (the times I've been) turned a new leaf (badumtshh). If the kitchen is closing, shouldn't the servers  been told that they were running out of supplies ? If they weren't, how come they were not informed? That's the main idea between the kitchen and crew - communication. There was no communication that night that indefinitely lead to unpleased patrons. Normally when you order and it's near the end of the night, the server should give you a heads up that some items are low, or if you order said product, they would offer to go to the kitchen to ask - but no! That was definitely  not the case. 

That's very uncool and incredibly unprofessional of the staff to not even give us the detail that they're out of duck. When the server tried to alleviate the situation with free dessert, that made us even more aggravated. Yeah, I'm seeing that you're trying to make things right, but it's just not fair to offer dessert when my friends didn't even get DINNER.

Honestly I'm really flabbergasted that Lotus would provide this type of service. We got our drinks taken off (after they were put on the bill, though they were ordered and paid for at the bar). Literally every other table got their food before us, and we ordered before them. There wasn't any sort of compensation for next time and I'm so sorry to my friends who were incredibly hyped for this meal when they received nothing but a dessert offer despite ordering an actual dish.",10,1,4

We made a reservation [quite late in the evening, but it worked with our schedule].  We were brimming with anticipation, driving to our fantastic dinner experience!

The location is in a strip mall, which is OK, as some fabulous gems are hidden away.  The entrance was quite tiny, and people had to rub shoulders to squeeze in or out of the restaurant.  We were seated in the large room, which resembled more  a cafeteria environment than a fine restaurant.  That was not what I envisioned.  We requested to be reseated, and were: in the front room, but at a table which was situated precisely between the 2 paths to and from the small dining annex , so there was a constant movement of diners and servers, non stop.  Fine, we settled down.

We ordered an appetizer of the Thai papaya salad, and spicy squid, along with a bottle of chilled white wine: Vermentino Litorale 2010 - crisp, ""snappy"", pungent.  But went so well with the spicy thai cusine. They DO have a fantastic wine selection: the ""cellar"" is housed behind a thick glass wall, so all can see the abundant wine offerings.  

The papaya salad was deceptively simple, yet very complex in flavors - a joy for the palate.  The squid salad was fabulously delicious, but extremely spicy: enjoy, but beware! I met my match in heat levels, and had to succumb to the help of thai tea with milk, to quench the inferno in my mouth.

For the main course, we selected pad ke mao with prawns, and crispy duck in cognac sauce.  My pad ke mao was awful!! The noodles were oily, hard and stuck together - clearly the dish sat a while under the heating lamps.  The prawns were absolutely bland, deep fried, and warm on the outside and cool in the center, from sitting too long.  I sent it back: it's an embarrassment to bring this quality of food to a diner!  They brought a fresh one: much better, but still missing the mark on prawn flavor.

The crispy duck dish was beautiful in presentation and taste: the crispy skin contrasted with succulent duck meat, surrounded by the delicious sauce with clear notes of coconut & peanut, and perfectly seasons for flavor and heat.  It was excellent, with the plain steamed rice.

For dessert we were dreaming of mango and sticky rice..... None to be had.  How disappointing.

Overall, this dining experience was a three out of four: the service felt rushed, and yet my first dish clearly sat for a long time before being served; the restaurant is extremely noisy - quite difficult to carry on a conversation at regular decibel level; lack of staple Thai dessert was very disappointing; and the seating arrangements leave a lot to be desired - at least for me.",2,0,0

Again, another unique dish to me and I couldn't get enough.  We had other dishes that I can't complain about, but these two were clearly the standouts. 

One thing I would mention, the spice level was not nearly as high as I assumed. We ordered ""medium"" and my next go round i would go high as I felt there wasn't much heat at all. That didn't take away from the fact that I really enjoyed my meal here. 

Prices are very reasonable for what you get. This is a very good choice to take a break from the flashy casino dining.",0,0,0

I noticed that 90% of the people who review this place only order about 10% of the dishes they offer (and the menu is about 10 pages long), so I decided to try two dishes that were not mentioned very often, including one more traditional Thai dish, and one of the more rare ""Northern Thai"" specialties. Overall, I really enjoyed my visit, and I'll try to address some of the things that other reviews mentioned as well.

1) Everyone seems to talk about how long the wait is for this place. However, if you come for lunch, especially early in the week, you will probably be able to get right in. I arrived at 10:30AM on a Monday (they open at 11:00AM), and I was all by myself in line until a couple minutes before they opened. By the time I left around noon, the restaurant still wasn't even 1\/3 full. Do yourself a favor and either a) come for lunch (although they only serve lunch on weekdays, and they did say that Friday lunch can get busy), or b) make a reservations (just be sure to make the reservation at least 4-5 days out). 

2) The service was *on point*! My server was speedy and attentive without being overbearing, knowledgeable about the food, helped me with my allergy (if you are allergic to milk, like me, very few of their dishes have dairy in them, and the ones that do are mostly desert or drinks), and kept my water glass full. I was very impressed with this.

3) The menu is HUGE. This could be good or bad for you, but I like having a ton of choices. You can find everything from traditional Pad Thai and curries to more rare ""Northern Thai"" dishes that are somewhat Burmese in flavor. They also have a really big drink menu, including a ton of wines. 

4) The food was excellent. For my traditional dish (so I had a point of comparison), I had a bowl of Tom Yum soup. It was excellent: perfectly spiced (you can choose how spicy you want it) and had a TON of chicken. Super yummy. For my exotic choice, I decided on ""Kha Nom Jean Nam Ngyow,"" a pork stew over rice noodles. The dish was like nothing I have ever had at a Thai Restaurant before, but reminded me a little of Burmese. It included ground pork with a spicy tomato\/chili sauce over noodles and garnished with bean sprouts and cabbage. I was pleasantly surprised and would highly recommend this dish. 

5) The prices were also reasonable: both of my dishes came out to under $20 with tax and tip. Many reviews talk about this place being expensive, but there are really just a handful of dishes (mostly the famous ones) that are pricey. To be honest, I didn't see a huge difference in price between Lotus of Siam and my favorite Thai places back home, except for the few ultra-popular specialty dishes. 

6) The restaurant is HUGE, inviting, and clean (including the bathroom). You can easily take the bus here from the strip (took about 25 minutes from the MGM Grand), but they also have lots of free parking. 

I can't wait to come back and try more dishes here: there are about 20 I am looking forward to trying. I'll be sure to update when I do. For now, you should really visit and try it for yourself!",3,2,1

Lets start with where its located... A ways off the north end of the strip in a shopping mall plaza that you wouldn't stumble across even after the most crazy night in Vegas if you weren't looking for it.  
Now that we have that over with, when you walk in you realize why this place has garnered its reputation.
The food is simply phenomenal. I mean, I've been to Thailand, gone to a Thai cooking class, and eaten every kind of street food there and Lotus of Siam was essentially the same thing minus the plane flight. The dishes were incredible, from the traditional Northern Thai (pork-based) dishes they are known for, to the duck, to the pineapple rice and stuffed chicken wings.

Without question order food family-style, don't eat the whole day before you go, and stuff your face when you are there.

It is clearly not in the world's best location, but you are going to Lotus for the food, not the massage parlor next door.  The menu is quite elaborate, and there are some unique items.  I typically ask the waiter for his recommendations and go with them. 

The recommendations were all good, but I think that they recommend the same stuff to everyone.  I told him that we were adventurous, but he basically recommended the same stuff.  Jumbo Prawns (so-so), Crispy Duck (good sauce), some coconut milk dish with noodles (bland), Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass (great noodles), and pork satay (yum).

The main thing that I would have changed with my order was to make things more spicy. I'm a big spicy guy, but this was pretty mellow.  I am confused why he did not ask us the level of spiciness that we wanted.

Located in a nondescript lot that would make one easily forget the glitz and glamor that are synonymous with Las Vegas. It was rather sketchy, not just by its looks but in actuality, if one were to go with Lotus of Siam and the Las Vegas police's notice to their patrons that asks them not to leave valuables in cars. We came twenty minutes after they opened for Saturday lunch, and there was already a fifteen-minute wait. The waiting area is rather intimate and I was truly thankful that we were able to sit in there instead of having to wait outside and experience the dry desert heat (already in the mid-80's at around 11 AM). However, we took advantage of this little wait to look up their menu and see what looks particularly appetizing.

The staff was incredibly friendly and were evidently used to handling their many visitors. We hardly had to wait for anything during our visit: the water glasses were refilled promptly, the food arrived in about ten minutes, and the check was given to us within five minutes of finishing our meal. Really, if I was a little nervous about grumpy service due to their popularity, my nervousness was misplaced.

Now to the food. For our appetizer, we tried the tod mun plar, which is a popular Thai street food. It was delicious. We were able to taste the fish without getting that unpleasant fishy flavor lingering in our palate after consumption. Even the daughter, who is not a fan of fish that does not come in fish and chips form, enjoyed the tod mun plar. It was a great omen for the rest of our meal.

For entrée, we had the northern larb, kang care, and crispy duck with panang sauce to eat with their combination fried rice. Everything was perfectly spiced and absolutely delicious. The northern larb is on the spicy side, so if you are not into spicy, maybe skip it. But if you like spicy food that offer complexity of flavors that go beyond the piquant, the northern larb will not disappoint. The kang care also delivered  and may be one of the best curries I have ever had.

The crispy duck with panang sauce from the chef's selection was undeniably the star of our meal. It was pricey, but it worked hard for every single cent of our hard-earned money. The duck was seasoned well and cooked perfectly that it did not get soggy even if it sat in the sauce it came with. But that sauce was unforgettable. It was very flavorful and just fantastic. My cousin and I had a ""friendly"" argument, which I lost, as to who can take the sauce home to eat with just plain steamed rice. Seriously, it was so delicious, I would be happy to eat that with nothing else but steamed rice for days on end and call myself a lucky girl. That good.

The fried rice was good, but I would suggest settling for steamed rice instead because it is rather heavy. I would prefer eating more of their delicious entrée rather than fried rice. While it did not disappoint, I was rather resentful of our choice to order it because I should have known better, what with my limited stomach space and all.

The food is on the pricey side and the servings are on the small side, but if you are in Las Vegas and want to go beyond the buffets they are justifiably famous for and want to go where locals go, do go to Lotus of Siam.",4,1,1

From the Outside this place looks super ghetto, sketchy and dead. But inside is a nice casual ambience with two sides of a dining room. 

I definitely think this place is overhyped, although It is better than other Thai places in Vegas. We ordered a grip load of food between the 4 of us. 

Raw shrimp- 5\/5. Best raw shrimp compared to my area in Orange County . The chili sauce and house made satay chili oil together was a mouth orgasm. Yum. 

Seafood Tom Yum- 3.5\/5 I think I like my soup more with a spicier and tangy kick to it. This soup was just okay to me. 

Garlic Prawn Shrimp- 3.5\/5 it's good, don't get me wrong. It's got a good taste and nice crisp to it. But it's nothing mind blowing because I've had something similar to it before. 

Spicy Spaghetti- 3.0\/5 not what I imagined .. I thought it was going to have tomato\/marinara sauce but it was some spicy chili sauce. 

Kao Soi- 4.5-5 crispy duck curry with egg noodle was great. The curry was too much coconut for my taste but that's only because I'm sensitive to coconut, otherwise this is a great noodle dish! 

Beef jerky- 4.5\/5 such a random pick my friend ordered but it's a solid appetizer just to pick at. It's surprisingly good and addicting!

We had the crispy duck drunken noodles. I dont really like noodle dishes so I did not try the noodles, but the duck was soooo good. We ate every last bite of this dish between the two of us...it was simply amazing. 
We overstuffed ourselves, so we had no room for dessert. I would definitely recommend the thai iced tea. It's pretty hard to go wrong with that, but it definitely went well with our food. 
I'm super excited for our next trip to Vegas - just to go back here again!",0,0,0

We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon arriving a little before 1 PM.  As mentioned by many other reviewers, Lotus of Siam is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall off of Sahara.  Unlike some others, though, we thankfully avoided being accosted by panhandlers likely because it was midday in July and we cabbed over from the Hard Rock (approx. $20 ride with tip), which let us off right at the front door.  Once inside, Lotus of Siam looked like pretty much every other family run Thai restaurant, although it was, perhaps, a bit larger and definitely more decked out with photos of celebs who've eaten there.  

For lunch, Lotus of Siam offers an AYCE buffet as well its full menu.  Skip the buffet.  We looked it over, but it was the standard fare you see on every Thai buffet line.  Instead, we elected to go with ordering off of the menu, which was more difficult than you'd think with over 150 various dishes to be found on its encyclopedic menu.  We started off with the Nam Kao Tod.  The complex mélange of crispy rice, minced pork, green onions, fresh chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice was as tasty as it's been described by countless Yelpers.  Next, we had the Kang Ka Noon, a northern style curry made with young jack fruit chunks, with pork.  Not being familiar with northern Thai cuisine and jack fruit, we took a leap of faith on this dish.  Our faith was rewarded with deliciousness, although it was definitely less spicy or ""curry-like"" than our preconceived notions of a Thai curry dish.  Finally, we had the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle.  The sea bass was delicately deep fried, then topped with a fresh chili and Thai basil sauce and served over pan fried, flat rice noodles.  The fish was moist.  The sauce was spicy and flavorful.  The noodles were perfectly pan fried, still tender, without dryness or rubberiness.  

Lotus of Siam may be overhyped, but damn if it wasn't the best Thai food I can ever recall having!  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors and colors were bold and bright.  Given that there are well over a hundred items we still haven't tried, it's a sure thing that we'll be back.",5,1,4

They open at 530 and we arrived at 5:10 and there were several ppl in the parking lot already. We lined up like there was a Black Friday sale.  At 530 they opened doors and took ppl with reservations 1st. We were seated fast and received great service. 

We went with yelp recs and got crispy duck in panang curry. It was amazing with perfect 8 spicy although very expensive.  We also ordered the soft shell crab with Drunken noodles which was pretty good but it was a small portion and expensive. Chicken wings weren't anything special. Garlic prawns were delish but again def expensive. Portions were small so we had to order 2 more items. Got the beef jerky which I personally didn't enjoy. I'm a sausage fiend so we got the sai oua which I felt was a little dry and missing something.

DON'T try anything typical - pad thai, pad see ew, etc. BRANCH OUT!!

Under the ""northern"" section, we chose the Khoa Soi with beef, which is a noodle dish with a sauce that is similar to panang, but lighter. Under the ""chef's special"", we ordered the Crispy Duck Panang because it was so popular on Yelp. OH. MY. GOSH. Both of those dishes were delicious. But the Crispy Duck Panang was on another level. The duck was so well prepared. You can taste the crispiness of the skin. I expected the duck to be soggy because it's in the panang sauce, but no. It was fresh, it was crispy, it was delicious. There is definitely a lot of spice in the dish, but it was still amazing.

Portions wise, each dish was on the small side. I typically only finish half of my entree from most restaurants, but I was able to finish my crispy duck panang and my boyfriend was able to finish his dish as well. The price point is also pretty high - over $20 for each of the dishes, but they were definitely worth it. I've never tried thai food like this before.

Wait time: we came on a monday night, about 20 minutes after they open and it was already pretty packed in the restaurant.

We started off with the Chicken Sa-Tay with peanut sauce. The dish came out beautifully with hot chicken that was perfectly spiced. 

Our main course consisted of Beef Larb, Chicken Panang Curry, and Kai Koowah. 

The Beef Larb we got at a spice level of 8\/10 and it was perfect. Great flavor, the spices came together well and what always sets good Larb apart in my opinion is the ability to taste the lime coming through all of the spices. 

The Chicken Panang Curry at a 7\/10 spice level brought some real heat. I love spicy foods and found that spice level to be just right. I really loved how sutras the coconut was in it and what really impressed me was the taste of the bell peppers. Something about them really stood out and complimented the Chicken and the curry sauce in a pleasing way. 

Finally the Kai Koowah. It had no spice to it and we weren't offered a spice level. At first I was upset about that but when we paired it with the rest of our meal I found it to be a perfect compliment to all of the heat that came with the other two dishes. The noodles were cooked perfectly, the chicken, like in the other dishes was well cooked. The flat noodle dish was a nice relief after eating such spicy things such as the Panang and Larb, leaving you with a mildly sweet taste in your mouth from the noodles. It cleansed my mouth of all of the spicy and really let me taste all of the food I was eating. 

All in all the restaurant was great. Coming from someone who frequently eats authentic Thai and Lao food cooked from my grandmother and mother (hard to beat)  I find it hard to believe the lower rated reviews.

(Warning: young adults from Central Florida in for vacation) Please don't order Phad Thai at this restaurant acclaimed for its Northern Thai cuisine (go straight to the back of the menu). My Kha Nom Jean Nam Ngyow was a more fluid stew of tomatoes, ground pork, and blood chunks over thin noodles. The accompanying lime and cabbages made this very refreshing especially with the slight spiciness tingling my tongue. Hubs took a Crispy Duck in Khao Soi- we worried the curry-based sauce would overwhelm the duck's flavor but it didn't. Instead the outer crispness of the duck, soft and flavorful interior, and creamy sauce all gave a harmony of flavors and textures.

TOP IT OFF WITH DESSERT AND GOOD PRICES
The crispy eggroll dessert (creamy bananas wrapped in a thin shell drizzled with honey) was too much for us to finish. We were stuffed and the pricing here was excellent- very, very similar to many Thai restaurants... which is a special feat when you consider how close it is to the Strip and its outrageous prices.

Lotus's interior is larger than it looks with most seats filled during our Tuesday night visit. And it's super casual- all kinda of people in all kinds of dress were inside. As others have mentioned, Lotus is located in a huge plaza filled with other casual eateries however there was something about the appearance that would caution me not to wander around there alone.",0,0,0

This plaza looks shady with no see-through windows. There will be homeless people asking you for money. This restaurant is in da hood. Who cares. You can offer them your leftovers (not the garlic shrimp though, which brings me to my next point...)

Ohhhhhh the yelpers are right. Always listen to us!!! Cos the garlic shrimp is so bomb diggity! They deep fry the whole damn thing and the shells and even the head are uber crispy and crusty (here, the crustacean can finally live up to its own name). They peel and devein the shrimp but the shell is still attached at the tail. So you take one bite of meat, then one bite of crispy shell, lick your fingers and your lips, and repeat, and hopefully you get to eat the last piece of the plate, because you'll most likely have to wait until your next Vegas trip to eat the shrimps again.

Moving on. Yummy soft shell crab drunken noodles! I've had lots of drunken noodles with chicken, beef, pork, shrimp... But soft shell crab was unprecedented. The portion wasn't as big as I expected, but the flavors were all there! Order it and you won't be disappointed!

Skip the tom kha and dessert. Flavor was bland, rice was hard and old!

Yum neau (beef salad) was worth a try. Make sure you order mild. Thai spicy cannot be undermined.

You might still have to wait for 5 to 10 mins even if you show up on time for your reservation, but at least they have a bar to let you have a drink while you wait. Service was awesome and staff were friendly.

Despite the few disappointing dishes, the good dishes were exceptional and unique. This is still a 5 star Thai restaurant!",3,3,1

Having heard so much about this place prior to even moving to Las Vegas, I decided to check it out for lunch almost immediately after unloading the U-Haul. Ah, the good old days (circa 2007!), when I had the kind of free time that would allow me to wait an hour to be seated for lunch! Yes, the most memorable part about the experience was definitely the wait time.

By the time I got a table, I was famished and impatient and opted for the lunch buffet. Nothing stood out as particularly mind-blowing, but none of the limited dishes were bad either. I believe there was a minced chicken dish, rice, a veggie noodle option, chicken wings and a few soups along side some salads and condiments. I filled up and left satisfied, but felt no overwhelming need to return immediately.

Based on the other reviews and mouth-watering user photos, I know I will need to try again, probably for dinner, and order some of the more exciting options.

I love Thai food, but didn't get a chance to dine here until we had a car to drive off-Strip to the back of a sketchy strip mall.  I wasn't put off by the location (I love a good dive), but it didn't seem like somewhere I really wanted to catch a cab.

We visited at lunchtime, tired and hungry from early-morning flights, and decided to hit the buffet.  I think this was our critical error.  The majority of the 5-star reviews here are for their menu service, not the buffet.  But we were starving and the limited options on the buffet seemed like a reasonable trade-off for instant gratification.  I wish we'd looked at the buffet before agreeing to be seated in the dining area around it - one glance and I think we would've opted for the menu dining room instead.

It was a small buffet and very little on it was Thai cuisine.  Mostly, it offered the typical Pan-Asian dishes you find on cheap buffets - rice, lots of stir-fried veggies and meats, some noodles, some broth-y soups, sliced fruit, crispy fried appetizer things, etc.  The Pad Thai and a veggie dish were the only recognizably ""Thai"" dishes out there, the rest were pretty uninteresting.  Nothing seemed particularly well-made or seasoned, either.  The highlight of the buffet was the fried banana wontons.  We ate so many of those once we discovered how mediocre everything else was.  

I'm sad to give Lotus of Siam a 2-star review, but the buffet doesn't deserve anything higher even if you're dining in a room literally lined in photos of the celebrity guests who have dined there (and a gigantic glassed-in wine cellar, which was incongruous with the buffet).

O M G the food is to DIE for, the service is amazing, wine cellar is crazy, and did I say the food is to die for?!?!
I came with a large party of about 15 of us on a Saturday evening. Apparently there is quite a long wait here but I didn't wait at all. Perhaps you should go right when they open at 5:30 pm. 

FOOD
I'm not exactly sure of the names of everything we ordered because the waiter recommended it all and we just went with the flow. We had a variety of dishes (3 of each one) that were all equally delicious and perfect in taste!!! My favorites were probably the Garlic Prawns (GIANT prawns perfectly battered and seasoned), the Crispy Duck Penang (oh my gosh), Papaya Salad (fresh, crispy salad), Pad Thai (just plain DELISH). 
The CRISPY DUCK PENANG is seriously the bombbbbbbb. It's perfectly fried, juicy and the curry sauce is sooooo good omg. Just thinking about it makes me hungry. The Riesling wine was also delicious and went well with all of the food.

SERVICE
The service was great! The servers constantly refilled our water and asked if we were enjoying our food. However, we were there for a birthday celebration and when he asked if he should bring out the cake, I told him we needed a bit more time but they brought it out with the candles lit (perhaps he misunderstood me..?). We had to ask him to blow it out and wait a little bit because we were waiting for the rest of our party to come back to their seats. After about 5-10 minutes he lit the candles again and started giving us the cake again even though we were still waiting for our party to sit back down so we just had to do the cake. This part was a bit rushed but it was fine. The service while we were dining was good and I have no complaints other than the cake incident haha.

The strip mall in which LoS is located is not easy on the eyes by any stretch, and finding it for the first time may take a great spotter riding shotgun.  However, the inside of the restaurant is nice enough--certainly more so than the outside.

I was most impressed by two of our dishes on the night we went: (1) Tom Yum Kai and (2) Pad Thai. The Tom Yum was, for me, the perfect balance of spicy and sour. Some Tom Yums I've had tend to lean more toward the sweet\/sour combo, so I loved LoS' rendition. The broth was pure tasting with the wonderful flavor of lemongrass which was not overpowering. 

For their Pad Thai, LoS uses round noodles, making them different from the flat noodles I've had at every other Thai restaurant I've been to. The sauce for their Pad Thai was otherworldly. 

We also had the mee kraab appetizer, green curry with tofu, and a Northern Thai curry dish with egg noodles and pickled vegetables. The mee kraab was very sweet with a hint of fish sauce, and was enjoyed by all at our table. I particularly loved the green curry, spicy, that was accented with wonderfully-cooked eggplant. And finally, I felt the Northern Thai dish was a bit one-dimensional with a heavy-handed red curry broth. 

LoS met the high expectations I had. When I return, however, I'll be sure to tell them to omit MSG from all my dishes, since they cook with it by default (but our server said they'll gladly leave it out upon request). LoS is a welcome respite from the strip--a very ""normal"" restaurant amidst the glitz and glamor of all that Vegas embodies.

For a non-local, I've had the luxury of being a semi-frequent patron of Lotus of Siam. I mean, there's a reason why the wait is notoriously long - I've heard that it's nearly impossible to score a reservation in advance. All of the food I've sampled has been pretty much on point. 

The Nam Kao Tod is my absolute favorite appetizer. Now either I've been under a rock for most of my life or that my Thai food palate is extremely minuscule, the latter may be a bit of a stretch considering I am Thai by blood (not a surprise though), but this is the first time I've encountered that dish. To me, it's the perfect marriage of unique flavors that Thai cuisine is notorious for. I MUST know how they fry the rice to get it to be so crunchy. It's amazing! Don't even get me started on the pork which has a similar taste to the Vietnamese appetizer called Nem Nuong. The perfect amount of lime is added to this dish which helps make it unforgettable. This is a must-try...unless you don't eat pork then I suggest asking for the pork to be served on the side. Get it - you're welcome.

I'd say that the only dish that I have ever been disappointed with was their pineapple fried rice. Go figure right? I mean, how can you mess up fried rice? Well, I shouldn't say mess up... I guess you can say that I was taken aback by the strong, Indian curry flavor which masked the entire dish. Like I said earlier, I've had my fair share of pineapple fried rice due to my previous experience with working at a Thai restaurant and being Thai so I have a pretty good sense of what to expect. It may be dependent upon individual tastes, but I personally think that the strong curry flavor really throws off the flavoring of the dish. I mean, it was so strong that I couldn't even finish my dish and I didn't even bother eating my leftovers (and I'm the leftovers Queen). Would I order this dish again? No, there are many other dishes to choose from, and if you are going to order this, be prepared for its' strong taste of curry.",1,1,0

My friends and I met up for a SoCal UYE of sorts while here on Yelp Spring Break.  We arrived before the restaurant opened for lunch.  At lunch they offer an AYCE buffet for $10.99 but you can also order a la carte too.  We decided to order off of the menu.

Chicken Satay (4 stars) - I thought the chicken was perfectly cooked.  It's really easy to overcook chicken but this was great.  The peanut dipping sauce and cucumber salad condiments were spot on.
Yellow Curry (3 stars) - Pretty standard curry but the vegetables were undercooked.  I like my curry vegetables to be a little softer.
Pad See Ew with beef (3 stars) - Pretty standard.  The noodles were soft and the Chinese broccoli was good.  

The service was ok at best.  We did ask for a large table because we were expecting a large party, however, we were stood up.  The waiter expressed that they could split our bill into 4 but that was the max he would do.  After our dishes were brought out, he disappeared until we had to flag him down for our check.  No matter.  The food was good, we were happy.  No reservations for lunch but they take reservations for dinner.",9,6,8

Perhaps it's because of too high expectations going in again and I've been looking forward to this place for weeks before my Vegas trip. We were dirty and running late after a hike in Red Rocks and booked it across town to make it here before they close for lunch.

Crispy duck in Panang curry - The duck was cooked really well and there was not a bone in site, unlike a majority of duck curries I've had in my life. The Panang curry was also quite tasty. However despite the good portion of duck, I thought $26 bucks or something was a bit overpriced.

Khao soi with beef - The cheapest but actually over favorite dish of the day. Flavor of the soup was incredibly rich and complex, and I really liked the slightly chewy texture of the egg noodles.

Garlic prawns - The most disappointing dish... The prawns are ginormous for sure, definitely why this dish costs nearly 30 bucks. The prawns are deshelled and both the shell and the meat are fried. The prawns themselves were very tasty though teetering on the edge of being overcooked. The shells, however, I found to be not crispy enough. They were certainly fried through and through, but I think it's a factor of the size of the prawn. When they get this big, the shells just simply get too thick and tough. To be honest, I rather have smaller prawns and a crispier shell than this.

Don't get me wrong, we still had a really delicious lunch here, but I'm just mostly saddened but the dish I was looking forward the most to didn't live up to expectations.",3,0,0

Make sure to make a reservation well in advance, as I tried to do a walk in, and was told I would have to wait an hour, and as I glanced at their appointment book, I notied that they had many many reservations for up to a week in advance. Note that they do not take reservations for lunch. 

There were tons and tons of non-Asians here, (more non-Asian than Asian), so you can be sure that if you bring non-Asian friends here that chances are they will love the food as much as you do and that the food is appealing to them as well 

due to scheduling conflicts, I wasn't able to dine here for dinner, but lunch, which offers the option between ordering from the menu and the buffet. My party was starved so we opted for the buffet. It was great - they had pad thai, friend rice, two different soups, egg rolls, fried banana, fruit, salad, some other thing sI don't quite remember - it was a pretty small buffet though.

We started with the egg rolls. We both thought it was just okay- nothing memorable. My friend ordered the drunken noodles with fried tofu (spice level 7 - we were raised on spicy Indian food and thought this was a good enough level to feel the heat and taste the food) and a Thai iced tea. She likes sweeter drinks so this was perfect for her. The drunken noodles had good flavor. I feel I have had better so this was a 4 out of 5 for me. 

I ordered the crispy duck in Penang sauce (spice level 7). The duck was nice and crispy and the sauce had good flavors. I would order this again.

We arrived at about 7:15pm on a Friday and was I already nervous about the location.  At first, I thought that my boyfriend had made a mistake, but no, it's really in a strip mall.  Call my snobby, but I was definitely shocked.  I was also worried about showing up at this time without a reservation.  We were running late for another event, so yes, I was a bit nervous.  As soon as we got there, though, I was able to immediately get a table and a couple of menus. 

I thought that it was a little overpriced, and that our server was a bit slow in refilling our water glasses, but all in all, pretty good dining experience.  

We ordered the following (and yes, we had them bring everything out at once and we didn't have any leftovers either...definitely starving):

Beef Satay Sticks - so delicious and full of flavor

Chicken Satay Sticks - delicious too, but a bit tougher than the beef sticks (so we ate these last)

The accompanying cucumber salad was as good as expected.

Beef with Pepper Garlic Sauce - the portion was a little smaller than expected, but the garlic pepper sauce was just enough to complement the tenderness of the beef.

Sea Bass with Ginger - again, the portion was definitely a lot smaller than anticipated, and the sauce seemed to be a bit much for the portion of fish that they gave us, but again it was still delicious, although it felt like i was eating a soup rather than a sea bass dish.

I'll admit that I was pretty impressed that even though we told the guy that we were in a hurry and the place was fairly packed, we got our food within 15 minutes of ordering.  However, I guess that the guy was a bit too busy to check back on us about our drinks, since I had to flag him down twice to give me a water refill.  

My only gripes are about the sort of slow service and the portions, prices, and a bit of the food.  All in all, I'm definitely willing to return and try this place out a second time.   

Whenever I get around to making a return trip, I'm not sure, though, if I'll be able to try anything other than the beef satay or beef with garlic pepper sauce.  Those two dishes are definitely a favorite of mine, at least for now.",3,0,0

I also used to be able to handle the spice, but that still doesn't stop me from enjoying it. I finally got a chance to try this place with one of my favorite people Dyanna. Since it was her lunch break we went at 1pm because at lunch time there can be a line out the door. 

The outside building is run down, but the inside of Lotus is huge and very chic. I was surprised to find table linens and cloth napkins instead of paper. They have a huge wine cellar that greets you as you are being seated. The waiters and waitresses were also dressed up. Really made me feel fancy. 

Lotus of Siam's menu is huge! They have anything and everything you could ever want when it comes to Thai food. I love that they separate the menu by regions of Thailand. In the end I decided on one of my favorite Thai dishes Pad See Ew with shrimp. (I used to be able to handle spicy food, but since my sleeve surgery three months ago my stomach can't handle it.) So I ordered a spice level 1. Dyanna ordered the Baby Corn and I think she got a level 6 or 7. 

Our food came out super fast. I have to say they made the best Pad See Ew that I've ever had! Talk about flavor! Wow! It exploded in my mouth. The noodles where all perfectly coated in sauce and were cooked al dente. Plus, they had it loaded with tender sweet shrimp. Dyanna let me try her Baby Corn dish and it was really tasty too. (I'm a total sucker for baby corn.) 

Our waiters were so attentive. When we were done they took both our dishes and boxed them up for us. They also brought our check quickly. Which is always nice when your on a time crunch. 

What a great lunch! Wonderful company and some bomb Thai food. I seriously can not wait to go back. I've been telling Joel I have to take him there.

Fortunately, that was not the case. There were certainly a lot of patrons during the lunch hour which is usually a good sign of a good place to eat.

Lotus of Siam offers a Thai buffet. I took a moment to look at the items offered at the buffet. To me, the food looked like it had been sitting out a while, but my friends who did opt for the buffet raved about it. Instead, I decided to order off the menu. I had the typical Farang dish, Chicken Pad Thai. The dish was fairly decent, although I definitely had better.

One thing I was not impressed with and weighed heavily in giving this establishment a 3 out of five stars is the fact that I was unimpressed with the service. We waited a long time to be served. Also, we ordered a thai ice tea and water. A good 15 minutes must of passed and we still didn't have our tea.

We couldn't decide between curry, crispy duck, or drunken noodles, so we took a shot in the dark with that last order (crispy duck curry with noodles)- what could go wrong? Crispy duck is delicious. Noodles were okay. I didn't love the curry, because it didn't have many spices. It tasted mostly like coconut to me. I thought maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, so I asked my cousin (a Vegas local) and she confirmed that is just how they make their curry. It's not my favorite, but did not detract from the crispy duck. If I were to do it again, I would get crispy duck on just about anything else.  

The jackfruit salad was sour, salty, spicy- full of flavor. The jackfruit was cooked and shredded, so it had a meaty texture.  (Not a raw salad, like papaya salad.) The seasoning was similar to the seasoning on any larb dish. I ate my salad on rice, and it was delicious.

Garlic prawns were pretty good too. The batter was crispy and the garlic topping was delicious. Worth the one hour wait in the sketchy parking lot.",3,1,1

It is located in the sketchier area of Las Vegas, sigh. We couldn't even make it into the restaurant without a man following us from our car to ask for money, and then getting on his knees until we got into the restaurant. Ay yi yi. I saw a few other would-be patrons getting hassled in a similar fashion from others as well.

We had to wait about 15 minutes before were were seated at our table. You're definitely going to feel a little claustrophobic in their waiting area because there were many people mushed together! 

Overall, it was a good experience while dining. They always made sure that our drink glasses were filled and came over to check on us often.

Right when we pulled up, we could tell this place was popular.  Large groups outside waiting for a table.  So that was a good sign.

It's on the sweet side so if that's not your thing you may not like it. 

Soon after sitting at the bar we got our table.  So service was already on point in helping us get our table early.  We ordered the crispy duck in curry sauce, garlic prawns and crab fried rice.  Pretty much the most popular items. And they were all delicious!!!  My favorite were the prawns and rice.  My wife fell in love with the duck.  And those 3 dishes filled us up good.

When we got dropped off around 1:30 for a late lunch, the cabbie advised us to just have the restaurant call for a cab when we were done.  

Thinking nothing of it, I approached the counter and asked them to call for a cab when our bill came.  We were told there was a cabbie strike in progress in vegas, and the wait times could be 30-60 minutes.  So, we went outside, and sure enough, ended up waiting 30-40 minutes, and still no cab.

Since we had eaten a late lunch, so the restaurant had closed to prepare for the dinner rush at this point, and out trots Saipin Chutima, along with her son and daughter.  We were standing with another couple who had been waiting nearly as long as we were, and all four of us recognized the owner and head chef from her appearance in the most recent season of Top Chef Masters.  They walked over to a pair of cars, and pulled them around in front of the restaurant.

Saipin's daughter Pennapa introduced herself, and apologized for the lengthy delay of our cabs.  They then proceeded to offer us rides to the Las Vegas Hilton, which is the closest major resort to the shop, so that we could arrange quick transport to our final destinations, rather than wait here with uncertainty.  Needless to say, we all accepted.

The other couple went off with Saipin's son, while my wife and I got to ride with Saipin and her daughter, who drove.  They were both extremely pleasant, with Pennapa making small talk about our trip and lamenting the service they've been getting from the cabbies due to the strike.  They asked about our meal, and what we had liked and disliked.

Once we got dropped off at LVH, we waved goodbye, and stood next to the same couple again laughing and wondering what had just happened.  Say what you will about the location and decor of Lotus of Siam; you will never in your life find better service than what we received there.  

Oh, right.  The food.  That's easy... simply the best Thai I have ever eaten.  No question.

We had Nam Prik Ong, which I had never had before, but will now actively search for.  Amazing, amazing, amazing.  Sticky rice is a must with this dish.  We also had an order of drunken noodles with soft shell crab.  My wife and I agreed that it was the best we'd ever had.  Of course, we also had some Pad Thai.  Also the best we've ever eaten.

our experience here was nothing but spectacular. our waitress knew just want to recommend. the wine list is good and when i asked her to recommend a good reisling, she picked just the right one for me. not too sweet, not too dry. just perfect. then when it came time to order, we told her what we wanted and she offered up modifications based on the various sauces of the entrees we ordered. she wanted to ensure we didn't get the same sauces and that we picked the best meat\/fish with the dish. thusly we ended up with a very comprehensive meal.

roasted duck curry
drunken noodles with chicken
charbroiled prawns
pad sw ew with seabass
poached salmon with chiles

my favorite of the lot was the roasted duck curry but all were amazing. i have boasted that my favorite thai food ever is thai tom in seattle (check out the reviews of that place if you care to understand the comparison), but this place MAY have surpassed thai toms. it's neck and neck for sure. 

i cannot rave enough about this place and i highly suggest that anyone going to vegas goes to lotus of siam. it's a quick cab ride from the strip and you won't be disappointed. just make sure you are a bit adventurous and don't order the pineapple fried rice or pad thai. you'll be missing out on the good stuff!",3,1,3

I've wanted to try Lotus of Siam for a long time and it didn't fail me in anyway. We shared an appetizer of veggies with chili paste, seabass with drunken noodles, and Crispy duck with panang curry(coconut curry). 

The veggies with chili paste was surprisingly good. The chili gave the veggies a lot of taste to it. the seabass was fried and we decided to combine it w\/ the drunken noodles. I thought the seabass was very good as it was seasoned well, cooked perfectly, while the fish is not dry at all and the crispy skin made it awesome. However, I was probably the only one but I thought the noodles was a bit endante? kinda hard ? I felt like it wasn't soft enough or cook long enough for some reason and that threw me off just a little. It wasn't too big of an issue but it was my little thing that I had to criticize about it. Finally we have the crispy duck w\/ panang curry. YOU have to make sure you get steam rice w\/ this(order separately)  or else you're not doing this dish justice. Have some rice, put the sauce on top, grab a crispy duck(which they cut for you) and my god it is wonderful. I never had ""crispy duck"" before but it was awesome. 

Took out a star because I thought the dishes were kinda luke warm which is a bit disappointing and I also think it's overpriced especially for how much they give you(which isn't that much imo). I would definitely still recommend you guys to try Lotus of Siam because these unique dishes are wonderful and if you had to choose one dish to get here...make sure you get the crispy duck with panang curry!",1,0,0

This world famous restaurant serves a wide variety of dishes out of a small, unassuming storefront within the commercial center shopping block. The interior is a combination of fancy wine bar [glass covered wine racks, marble counters, lacquered wood, etc] and cheesy chinese restaurant. The food itself is the star, so I don't mind.

We started with a glass of wine each. I had a semi-dry riesling while J had a pinot noir. Both were fabulous and the wine list is epic! My riesling was fruity and crisp without being overbearing. It was a nice counterpoint to the spicy food. J's red wine was very smooth without any acidity

I ordered a cup of the Tom Kha Kai, a sweet and tangy coconut based soup with tender pieces of chicken and lots of veggies and fresh herbs. Most places use substandard chicken for this soup but that was not the case here. The soup was rich and extremely flavorful, easily the best thai soup I've ever had! 

We also had the papaya salad. I ordered it at a spice level of 9-10 and it was definitely spicy! It snuck up on me after a few bites and was quite strong, but the overall flavors were excellently executed. The contrast of pungent, savory, sweet, nutty, herbal and chiles was something I could find addictive. When we were leaving some of the employees seemed impressed, ""Ah, spicy number 10! that was you!""

Next came the crispy duck with chu-chee sauce and garlic prawns. We originally inquired about the lobster, but they were out for the day and recommended the prawns instead. The crispy duck was tender with a light, crisp crust and a rich curry sauce. This was J's favorite and is a fabulous way to eat duck! The sauce is great over rice. 

The garlic prawns looked like a huge portion but it turned out that half the pile were empty shells. It was a bit deceiving but even the empty shells were pretty good with the seasoning. The prawns themselves were great, juicy and large. I don't think I would order this again if I weren't celebrating but it was very tasty.

I also had a thai iced coffee to go. It was a strong coffee with chicory flavors and a good balance of sweet and creamy to the bitter coffee. The portion was generous, too!

This is probably some of the best thai food you can find if you don't have a doting thai grandmother to lavish upon you. The meal ended up costing us almost $100, but it was worth it for a once a year celebration. I look forward to returning to try more of their food, like the Issan style tom kha kai, pad thai and sea bass. Their tea also looks really nice, served in a glass teapot that allows you to watch the water infuse. I didn't ask about it this time, but when we return I look forward to seeing what kinds of teas they offer.

The portions are pretty good sized, so it was a lot of food.  The 4 of us were stuffed.

The food here is VERY spicy, watch out for how spicy you order things.  It's from 1-10, and the 7 is extremely hot, even though i eat spicy food all the time.  The soup we ordered was 7, and i was dying and sweating non stop.  I asked if they had milk to cool down the spicyness, and the waiter laughed at me :( (as did everyone else at the table).  then i asked if i could change my entree from a 7 to a 2, and he said no too late, and laughed again :(.

Considering I live in what is probably the highest concentration of Thai restaurants in NYC, I had to check LoS out for myself.  

The result?  A 4.5.  I wouldn't say this was perfect, as I had some individual dishes elsewhere that I thought were on par or better than LoS, but some other dishes were also total standouts.  

Fortunately I was here with a large group, so we were able to sample a huge variety of dishes.  My impressions:

Appetizers
Golden Tofu - Nice texture and not too greasy.  Small, bite-sized portions were nice and this was definitely better than what you find in an average Thai joint (4\/5)

Chicken Satay - Not bad, and the chicken they used was tender and not overcooked.  But there are other places that serve something comparable (3\/5)

Nam Kao Tod - This was surprisingly my favorite dish of the night.  This appetizer had both amazing flavors and textures.  The crispy rice and sour pork were just divine.  Note, this dish is absolutely fucking spicy.  Your anus will burn later on if you don't ask them to tone down the spice up front, but it's still a tasty dish (5\/5)

Soups
Tom Yum Koong - Maybe it could have been spicier, but that's probably because the Nam Kao Tod blew out my senses so this didn't feel that intense.  I really liked the freshness of the shrimp with this soup. (5\/5)

Salads
Chicken Larb - For me this dish often is a sign of how legit a Thai place is.  For the most part I enjoyed it, though I can honestly say there are many places in NYC that I've had way better, at least for me.  (3\/5)

Chef's Choice
Chilean Sea Bass with Suki Sauce - OMG so tasty.  Absolutely awesome fish that had a great mix of spice, crunch, tenderness and flavor.  Enuff said. (5\/5)

Garlic Prawns - One of their signature dishes and with good reason.  Holy shit this was my favorite dish along with the Nam Kao Tod.  It was absolutely perfect in terms of freshness, flavor, texture and balance.  You must order this (5\/5).

Noodles
Pad Thai - Definitely one of the more refined Pad Thai's I've had in a long time.  While it was good in terms of taste, I could have actually used even more in terms of flavor, but that's just me.  At least the texture was solid.  (4\/5)

Pad Se Ew (pork) - I liked this WAY better than the Pad Thai.  The flavor was kick ass and if you're not careful you can literally gulp down an entire plate of this.  I can live this plate of flat noodles and some garlic shrimp and that'd be a perfect meal for me.  (5\/5)

Dessert
Coconut Ice Cream over Coconut Rice - My tablemates loved this.  I mean they wanted to inhale this.  I thought it was good but it didn't blow my mind.  The slightly salty texture of the rice definitely was legit compared to the desserts I ate while living in SE Asia, but I preferred the ice cream sans rice.  (3\/5)

All in all, the meal was satisfying and about as memorable as it can get when you're with a loud group of friends drinking Singha beer to wash down all the spice.  The service here was nice and the vibe here with relaxed.

So is it worth schlepping your ass off the Vegas strip to visit this dinky place in the middle of a random strip mall?  If you like Thai food, the answer is definitely yes.

Service was very good and our waiter knew the menu inside and out, answering every one of my questions. The service is also very fast.

The inside of the restaurant is nice enough - not modern or hip in any way but nicer than your average Thai. The location is straight ghetto, but never fear, you'll be accompanied by a steady stream of taxis, limos, and others making the sojourn this many blocks from the Strip. It's not a secret, this place.

The only flaw - a minor one in the scheme of things - is that the prices were a bit high for the amount of food ordered. The portions are quite modest. You will need to order at least one entree per adult and possibly more.

Is this the best Thai I've ever eaten? I don't know - it was pretty darn good. And a lot of the dishes simply aren't available at your nearest Thai joint. Experiment a little - this is not the place to get panang curry and pad thai, even if they happen to be really good.

The crispy garlic prawns were a step down though; not very garlicky at all and I think the batter wasn't fully cooked.

If you're on a time crunch, I'd browse the menu online beforehand so you have a good idea of what you want to order. The menu is like a book! So many options! I wanted to try it all!

We ordered:
1. #56 NUA SAO RENU Sliced charbroiled beef served on beds of sliced cabbages, topped with our homemade tamarind sauce and fried dry chili. $17.95
2. #39 SOM THUM [Thai Papaya Salad]  green papaya, chili, tomato, crushed
peanuts mixed with lime juice, fish sauce and sugar. $8.95
3. GARLIC PRAWNS Deep fried prawns with shellls (almost like potato chips), sautéed with our special garlic sauce, topped with ground black pepper. $26.95
4. CRISPY DUCK DRUNKEN NOODLE Crispy duck topped with fresh homemade chili and Thai basils. Served on the top of pan fried flat rice noodles. $25.95
5. Fried banana dessert $8 plus coconut ice cream $4. These two go together heavenly, but the star really was the coconut ice cream.
6. Thai iced tea x 4.  The Thai tea here is really good. Not over sweet like other Thai restaurants. The tea flavor really comes through.


Pros:
1. Delicious food. Everything we ordered was really good and I would order again.
2. Lot of variety on the menu. Especially Northern Thai dishes
3. Fresh ingredients. You can taste the quality.

Cons:
1. Pricey for Thai food, 4 dishes + 4 thai teas = $110 after tax, before tip. Yikes.
2. Can be a long wait depending on what time you go

Verdict: Totally worth it! The food here is amazing. It's a must visit restaurant on my Vegas list.

Pro-tips:  
1. GO STRAIGHT TO THE BACK OF THE MENU TO TRY THE NORTHERN THAI DISHES 
2. Go with a bigger group if you want to try more dishes!
3. Beware of the spiciness levels! Thai spicy is no joke! We got level 2 and it was pretty spicy for me and I'm usually great about handling spicy foods.",1,0,0

Drunken noodle with soft she'll crab - decent, but not mind blowing

When the taxi driver first dropped me off in front of Lotus of Siam, I wasn't immediately impressed.

I am going to start off by saying that I have had TONS of Thai places, tried TONS of different variants of the same staple dishes. This place completely blew my mind. We ordered the crab fired rice, beef panang, garlic shrimp, and the nam kao tod. My favorite dish was the beef panang which was absolutley amazing. The slices of beef were huge and tender all the way through. The curry sauce was nice and thick and chock full of flavor. I litterally could have sat there all day with that sauce and just ate it with rice.

I had heard for several years that many food critics claim it has the best Thai food in America, and this place definitely lives up to the hype. 

I've been a Vegas resident for over a decade and dined at almost every high-end restaurant in town, but this is easily one of my favorite spots in the city. There are something like 130 or 140 menu items to choose from and the prices are incredibly reasonable -- especially considering how popular this place is. It's not remotely fancy inside and the location is in a dirty shopping center in a bad part of town, but the food is unbelievably exceptional. 

Reservations are definitely recommended if you want to eat on a weekend evening at a preferable dining hour, but don't give up if you call ahead and the receptionist says they're booked. Simply walk in around 9-9:15 (they close at 10) and you probably won't wait for more than 20 minutes or so. Ask the receptionist and she'll tell you the same thing.

And if you're looking for some cheap after-dinner entertainment, I suggest sitting in your car for a few minutes and checking out the people coming and going from ""The Green Door"" (the supposedly world famous swingers club inside the same shopping center).

I've heard they get packed with lines out the door. The online reservation system doesn't seem to be the most accurate since they seem to only allocate a certain amount of seats to the online portal. We called in when they opened and they kindly informed us that there were plenty of seats available.

Walking into the restaurant feels like you've entered an Anthony Bourdain rerun. The blatant glass wine cellar that lines the central walkways pose a simple question. Does wine go with Thai food?

I didn't dare to try. Instead, we opted for the Khao Soi with Crispy Duck, Garlic Prawns, a side of sticky rice, and for dessert: mango sticky rice.

The Khao Soi is unbelievable. I've been searching far and wide in the West Coast for Northern Thai Khao Soi. The type with the unmistakably scrumptious broth, perfectly cooked wide-egg noodles, and a winged-meat pair served directly inside the creamy dish. In Chiangmai, I caught a bowl of Khao Soi flanked with a chicken leg at the train station and even that was impressively amazing. This bowl of yellow curry noodles is truly a portal into my travels through Northern Thailand. The boneless crispy duck is a flawless touch with just the right amount of crunch and flavor you'd expect from the winged-cousin.

Garlic Prawns are cool. The way they prepare it is rather interesting. They splice the prawn along it's shelled-back and dig out the meat from within the shell. They keep the shell attached to the shelled-fish as they fry it and it becomes a crunchy butterfly. Dressed heavily with garlic and served with a side of rice, this dish was the perfect pair with the curry noodles.

Pro-tip: use the extra curry from the Khao Soi for the Garlic Prawn's rice for a moist addition to the fried dish.

Lastly, the mango sticky rice with coconut cream is the perfect way to end the meal. The juxtaposition of warm coconut rice with a cold mango gives an ice cream dessert a run for its money.

LOS is located in a rundown business park; but it's an anomaly among its neighbors.  And that's clear from the moment you walk in.  People often complain about the waitimes (just read a few other reviews on here), but that's just a byproduct of LOS's excellence.  If you want a short line go to Panda Express.

Inside, it's Thai fine-dining, yet a casual vibe remains: you can celebrate an anniversary, you could show up in sweatpants (like I did today).  The walls are plastered with pictures of the owner and various celebrities, food critics, chefs, and friends.  I'll be up there one day, just watch.  An exquiste wine cellar is the centerpiece of LOS.  And its busy bar is a great place to wait for a table.  Once you're showed to your seat, the waitstaff more than take care of you.  They're pleasant, despite being ultra-busy, you'll never be without a full glass of something, and they're happy to explain or recommend a dish.

While the ambiance and service is a highpoint, the food is why this place is great.  I have only had a few dishes, but I don't think their is a bad choice on the menu.  I got Yellow Curry the first twenty or so times I came to LOS.  (That's always been my default dish to gauge a Thai restauraunt.)  It's the best curry I have ever had.  I have also had their Chicken Pad See Ew several times, which is equally tasty.  

The last ten or so times, however, I have ordered--or, better put, devoured--tehir Chicken Khoa Soi.  I get it at a 7 out of 10 on their spicy scale.  It's the perfect balance of heat and flavor.  (I'd get a 5 if you can't handle heat, though.)  It's the best Khoa Soi I have ever had, and I'd bet it's the best Khoa Soi in the U.S.  That's how good it is; that's how good LOS is.

They asked us how spicy on a 1-10 scale. We said 5, and I'm glad I didn't go over that, because it was definitely spicy - not unpleasantly so, but I would probably order a 3 or 4 next time.

For main courses we got the Garlic Prawns which are as good (if not better) than all the reviews say. The prawns are fried with the shells still on them, and they get crispy ""like potato chips"" according to the menu, and are super tasty. We also ordered the Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodles. There were only a couple pieces of duck that were actually ""crispy,"" but wow was it tasty. 

The only problem with it being off the strip is that it took us ONE HOUR to get a cab to pick us up. Some of the cab companies said they wouldn't even pick us up.

They have a lot interesting dishes like their special crispy duck in curry (good but the dish is very heavy for 2 to share- plus the crispiness of the duck disappears once it has soaked long enough in the curry), kao soi (curry noodle), garlic shrimp (fried shrimp with shells on- which I am not quite a fan on).

On a Thursday night, 8\/25\/2011, I was looking for somewhere to go to dinner.  I didn't feel like going to a buffet because I just spent $90 on the Rio Village Seafood Buffet the night before where the food and service sucked!  So, I turned to Yelp to look for a good place off the strip, and found Lotus of Siam.  

This place was a little hard to find on Sahara Blvd, but with my great sense of direction, I was able to find the place with no problem.  I was craving shrimp for the night, so I ordered the Drunken noodle prawn and Crab fried rice.  At first they brought out Drunken noodle soft crab.  Our waiter gladly took the wrong food back and shorty brought the right one out.  

The moment I laid my eyes on the feast before me, I was blown away.  I have never seen shrimp deep fried this way where the shell and the shrimp were separated but still connected somehow.  The taste was heavenly and the spice level was perfect.  The crab fried rice was also good, not too oily and not too salty either.  The service was also great and fast.  I had my water filled without asking for it.  It was so good, I went back the next day for lunch.

fortunately, we deviated from the standard buffet menu.  the buffet looked boring--like Thai\/pan-Asian 101 for clueless americans.  we both ordered from the Northern Thai specialty menu in the very back of the menu.  

FOOD--beef jerky: yummy.  i have no idea how they make it so moist!  i probably don't want to know... i think another reviewer said it was deep fried?  but it's good.  nothing as phenomenal as the pork dish described below, but still an experience in taste and texture.  

FOOD--fish cakes: i guess they're ok.  my b\/f LOVES them, says they're better than any he's ever had.  as for me, it's food so i'll eat it but nothing to write home about.  

FOOD--Jack Fruit with Chicken: i'm not a huge pork eater, and i'm always a little suspicious of eating seafood in the middle of the desert.  could be just coast snobbery, but i just don't think seafood can be nearly as good a couple hundred miles from the sea.  anyway, i ordered the jack fruit with chicken dish.  i would have really liked the dish except i ordered it too spicy!  i said medium, but it was pretty darn hot.  even my b\/f, who LOVES spicy food (he was in Thailand and even the Thais were impressed with the amount of hot peppers he consumed) thought it was pretty spicy.  not initially, but it crept up on you.  maybe b\/c i'm asian they thought i meant medium Thai, not medium american.  

FOOD--Northern Thailand dry pork: my b\/f ordered this dish 10 spicy.  even with the amount of heat, i tried a tiny, tiny bit of pork and i was blown away.   i don't mind heat so much as long as there is still flavor to the dish, and boy was this dish flavorful!!!!  omg, the tiny bit i tasted was phenomenal!!!  there was a warm, heady, complex spicy flavor that, had it not been 10 spicy, i would have devoured--even though i'm not a huge pork fan.  

we were unfortunately too full for dessert--i really wanted to try the mango and sticky rice.  next time, though, i will get my dessert.  

SERVICE: i thought the service was really quite excellent.  my water glass was always full--thank goodness!!!  and all of the staff made sure my b\/f always had a full glass of diet coke.  he must have had 5 diet cokes while we were there--no joke.  he needed it, the food was really hot!  we were there over lunch, so while everyone else was going for the buffet, we were getting great treatment.  maybe it's different at dinner.  

oh, and the wait was reasonable.  i think we waited 15-20 minutes?  

DECOR: who the hell cares???  the food is amazing!  actually, i kind of like hole-in-the-wall places, especially in vegas where everything is so manufactured and shiny.  i feel more like i've discovered a little gem than when i'm in a fancy restaurant.  and the past few times we've gone to the fancy places, i haven't been so impressed with the food.  and i didn't think the decor is so bad.  not ""romantic"" by any means, but what kind of person would you rather date???  someone who cares only about external appearances, or someone who appreciates the quality on the inside???  

NEIGHBORHOOD: i was only there for lunch, but i've been near there at night before and have never felt unsafe.  then again, i lived in new york for three years and used to walk the streets of paris at 3am.  maybe i'm too blase about the vegas ""ghetto"" to feel unsafe.  

all in all, be adventurous and either ask the waitstaff for a recommendation or go out on your own.  you won't be disappointed... unless you get the buffet.  honestly, just how amazing beyond words can green curry really be???  you can get standard Thai anywhere.  if you're going to go here, you might as well get something you can't get anywhere else (outside of Thailand).",1,1,1

Went with a group of 9 and so we got to try everything and everything was DELICIOUS!!!

We ordered the following:

Catfish w Thai Basil, Pad Thai w chicken, Padseew w Beef, Garlic Prawns, Crispy Mussel Omelet, Green Curry, Crispy Duck with Panang, Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab. 

Everything was very good!!! But if  you must choose a few from the list above I would go with Garlic Prawns, Crispy Duck with Panang & Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab. 

I would probably pass on the Pad Thai, Padseew & Green Curry next time. Pad Thai & Padseew was good but you could get just as good noodles elsewhere. Green Curry was kind of plain compared to the other dishes. If you want curry I would get the Crispy Duck w Panang over the green curry. 

TIPS: 
1) Make RSVP online on their website! So much better than trying to call to make RSVP! Lifesaver!!! :)

They have a fantastic wine selection and unlike many Thai restaurants your wine comes in real crystal and not thick glass goblets.

It's a small dining area which makes its cozy.

All in all, if you like thai food and are in vegas, and don't mind straying away from the strip, I would recommend going there.",0,0,0

I came here on a Thursday night around 8pm with no reservations (stupid me), but for 2, we only waited 30 minutes,  which isn't bad at all.  There were many people getting out of cabs and people were walking so fast into Lotus,  like a competition.  

Now onto the food:
I heard so many great things about this place and wanted to keep my expectations low,  just so I don't hype myself out.  But.. the food was to die for. The crispy duck with penang sauce was really good: the outer crispiness with the tenderness of the duck.

I got a curry dish,  and it was perfectly seasoned. I used it as dipping sauce as well as for other items besides rice. 

The sea bass over drunken noodles was also very tasty. 

I wish they had this in los angeles, going to vegas for Thai food is too much of a commute!",3,1,3

Monday of labor day weekend at 7pm had a 20 minute wait, which isnt bad at all and the service was great but the food was only just okay- not great. The tom yum soup was tasty and had generous portions of prawns but it came out luke-warm. The northern larb wasn't tangy enough for me, but that was probably our fault for ordering the northern version instead of the usual one. The drunken noodles weren't very empressive, the noodles felt chunky and were clumped together so much so that I basically just speared a chunk with my fork and bit it piece by piece. The papaya salad was good and comparable to some of the good thai restaurants I've been to in NorCal. My favorite dish was probably the curry (can't remember exactly which one we ordered, sorry), it was creamy and oh so flavorful. The prices are in line with most all thai restaurants, but the portions are a little on the smaller end.

The menu is immense but we did some research before hand so knew what we would be ordering ahead of time.  We had reservations and were seated right away!

Tom kah Kai - (3.5 stars)  broth was amazing!  The lime accent was perfect and the coconut was not too overwhelming.  The chicken however did taste old.  If the chicken was more fresh and tender this dish would be a five!  Maybe it was an end of the night issue.. chicken sitting for to long in the back in the pot.
Sea bass drunken noodles - (4.5 stars) the Seanad was super tender and the light breaking was perfect.  The drunken noodles were delicious and the combination was supreme. 
Crispy duck in panang curry- (5 stars!) It had a nice crispy exterior and the meat was tender but not at all fatty. The panang curry sauce was a great compliment to the duck. We finished off the sauce by putting it on everything we could find at the table! 
Garlic prawns - (4 stars) my first prawn was very good with a very nice garlic sauce.  However my second shrimp was very fishy.  So much so that I could not get the taste out of my mouth.  Everyone else that had one said theirs were great so not sure what happened with that one:-(
Nam prik ong - (3 stars) we were super excited to try this as we saw it featured as one of Ming Tsai'd favorites. While it was tasty, the after taste really reminded us of ground beef. Also it comes with a number of veggies for dipping which wasn't as tasty as the pork rinds that also came with the dish. 
Khao soi braised Short rib - (4.5 stars) meat was tender but the real star was the sauce and noodles.  Yummy!
Thai iced tea - (4 stars) very good typical thai ice tea
Fried banana - (3 stars)  ok, not great.  Would not order this again.
Mango and sticky rice - (4 stars) we asked for two orders and they brought them out on one plate.  The mango was delicious but not enough sticky rice

We were a party of five and they added gratuities on our bill which I found off.

Service was ok but not great.  Bus boy was  much more attentive then our waitress.

Orange chicken- Tasty enough to have seconds

Any variation of the Pad Kee Mao (particularly with crab) ordered spicy is amazing, but the my favorite dish here is the duck panang.

Tom kha chicken was gross. Horrible flavor, chicken smelled bad. 
Satay Chicken didn't have much flavor, peanut sauce was ok. Texture of the chicken tasted boiled then lightly grilled in a pan maybe? No smoky grilled flavor, chicken tasted very soft like it has been marinated for way too long or old.
Pad see ew was ok. Noodles were too soft for me and not enough flavor,very bland. Not enough veggies.
Husband received a wrong order. We just kept it since he ate it, and cancelled the other order. It was a panang pork, very small plate.
Thai tea was decent but not worth $5.

We had several different salads. The banana blossom one was, are there words? No. I don't think there are. There wasn't a bad one in the bunch. Some were requested hot. And we got Thai hot. Which is blow  the top of your head off good.

Some of the pieces were perfect, while others were more tough and dry. The must-try dish of the night was the sea bass. The fish was perfectly fried, but the drunken noodles left much to be desired.

The waiters, even the hosts, really know their food. If you ask, they will recommend the best, and it truly is the best. I did visit their ladies restroom and I was very surprised to see a fabulously clean and well groomed restroom. Soap, toilet paper..everything was stocked. When you see the outside of the restaurant, you wouldn't necessarily think it was nice on the inside, but everything on the inside was professional including the waiters and hosts. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in town.",0,0,0

Spiciness is my downfall, and the papaya salad that went with the seabass massacred my tastebuds.  I had to ice my tongue for the next 15 minutes, and couldn't taste the sexy food for that duration.  I think the waitress felt bad as she walked around and saw my whole group dying from the spiciness.  Unfortunately, the food got cold, and wasn't as yummy.

Plates my group ordered (1-5 scoring):

1.  Sea Bass - 4, very very good, but small portions
2.  Curry (forgot which one, probably yellow) - 4.5
3.  Duck with some curry - 5
4.  Tom Ka (I think) - 5
5.  Spicy sausage - 3
6.  Soft shell crab over noodles - 3.5

The biggest issue I have with this place is price....and really I can't blame them.

Being Asian and coming from an Asian family that used to own their own fast food restaurant makes you look at Asian food differently.  More specifically, how much you spend on the food.

I have a big pet peeve about paying top dollar for cheap food and this place is exactly that.  It's just like high end Mexican food where people for some reason to agree to pay $20\/plate for rice, beans, and some enchiladas.  It's rice and beans people! 

Anyway, we tried the highest recommend.  Garlic Prawn, Duck Panang, fried bananas, nam kao tod, and mee krob.

Although all of it was good, I sat there at the end thinking, ""did i just pay $100 for all this when it's just decent Thai food?""

Of course, getting there was a little difficult because it doesn't face the main street so there won't be any signs for it. You pretty much turn on a small street the directly connects to the plaza that Lotus of Siam is in. It doesn't look crackin' on the outside, due to the large unused lot, but once you step inside the venue, you'll see that the place usually has a full house around 7-9 PM. 

First of all, a must order is the Nam-Prik-Ong (Red Chili Dip under their Northern Thai Cuisine). It is a burst of flavor in every bite. The dip contains ground pork with various spices, and is eaten with sticky rice or fresh vegetables. After hearing about this dish from the all-famous, next Iron Chef Ming Tsai, I had to come to this place on one of my frequented trips to Las Vegas. And I have not stopped thinking about this dish since. Too bad its only an appetizer because I would definitely eat it as an entree if I could. 

We also had the Plar Koong, Nua Dad Deaw, Moo Yang, Tom Yum Kai, and various other dishes (went with a party of 8 hungry hungry hippos - JK, I love you guys). All of those dishes were great!! Just one warning though, if you get the soup and they ask you for what level of spicy-ness (1-10), don't say 7 unless you want to get your mouth seriously burned and engorged with capsaicin. That was the most spicy dish I've ever had. I bet the soup would have tasted lovely if it wasn't over powered by all that spice. But anyways, their food was still top notch for Las Vegas.",5,1,1

I've had a lot of amazing thai food in NYC and not enough Thai food on the west coast or in Las Vegas in particular to make this type of statement. I will bow to the fact that everything is excellent and it makes me want to return to Las Vegas just to try this restaurant one more time.  Next time, I want to bring 10 people so we can order a larger variety of dishes and try a litlte bit of everything.

From what I did try, here are my thoughts:
Beef tar tar: Spicy, but not in an overpowering burnt tongue way. I could really taste the different spices put into that make it burst in your mouth

Prawn salad: Very interesting combination of sweet and spicy. Prawns were huge and seared slightly. Probably the least favorite out of all I ate.

Crispy duck curry: Crispy duck was ... very crispy. I think the coconut milk curry was excellent, but the duck could have been any crispy meat and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I just like this because curry is awesome with rice.

Chicken pad thai: This was my favorite. I can tell this place is awesome by how amazing they make their pad thai. The noodles didn't stick together and the flavor was evenly distributed across every noodle. The peanut sauce was there for the kick and not overpowering. Chicken was tender and a nice addition.

Tom Yum soup: We ordered this after eating everything else because we needed to get a taste of the other popular thing on Thai menus.  Yum. Must try. It wasn't lit on fire like at Jaiya, but it was delicious and the perfect amount of spicy and sour.

Overall, I can't wait to go again. I'm a bit confused why it's in the middle of nowhere, but I'm glad this hasn't stopped people from taking the trek to get there and enjoy.  Be sure to make reservations because this place gets packed by 6:30",1,0,1

Still, I would recommend this to people who are looking to get away from the chains, buffets, and mostly americanized food on the strip.  It's nearby and pretty good.  It seems more authentic than most other places and has a wide variety of Thai dishes.  

Nam Kao Tod: slightly sour, which is a little weird at first, but overall I really liked this dish.  Yumm crispy rice.  

musaman curry - To be honest the curry was a little thin and the flavor wasn't as deep and rich with spice as this place in Houston I love.  Ever since I ate the ""masamun curry"" there, that's the benchmark I place other curries at.  Lotus' curry was just so so.  However, the beef was great!  Super tender.  

Drunken noodles - Really tasty.  I would recommend this dish.  we got it with seafood, but there's a whole bunch of other variations you can get the noodles with.  

I think the last thing we got was the red curry, but I'm not sure - I liked it better than the musaman curry, richer flavoring.  Decent choice.

I have had Thai before so I am not a total neophyte. A friend and I decided to go out and had heard great reviews about Lotus of Siam. I Googled them, of course, to see what we were in for. I saw the words ""Extended Wine Selection"" and was immediately on board. The location is not the best in Vegas as the Commercial Center (yes, that is the actual name of the strip mall) has seen better days. Parking was plentiful and the restaurant was easy to find. Walking in, it seemed a little small until we entered the main dining room saddled by a giant wine cellar. The decor looked better suited for a mid 1990's country club, and was sort of all over the place, but not kitschy or themed which I appreciated. 
   The moment we were sat, waiters sort of came out of nowhere to bring us plates, water and cutlery. Extended wine selection is an understatement. The wine menu is larger than the food menu. I chose a cabernet on the lower end of the price scale as I am no Rockefeller and was pleased with it. Most impressive was the two wines that were ordered came in the appropriate glasses. One red and one white. (This is rare). 
   Once ordered, the food was brought to us very quickly. I ordered the Seafood Fried Rice and my friend ordered the Mint and Green Chili Beef (spiced at a level 9 out of 10). I was surprised at the serving size we were given for an entree priced just north of $10. I was full at the end of the meal with no appetizers or desserts. (Also rare). My friend, being more of a Thai food junkie than myself was satisfied that ""this place wasn't messing around"" when it came to spice. Apparently, many restaurants fall short in this department. The seafood tasted wonderful in the fried rice and included shrimp, crab, calamari and scallops. 
   The noise level was average, I didn't feel like everyone could hear our conversation, and try as I might, I couldn't eavesdrop on anyone else. The overall feel of the restaurant was unpretentious, relaxed and the service was consistent, yet unobtrusive. Toward the end of our meal, we were elated when the current Mayor of Las Vegas and his wife, the Mayor-Elect, were seated next to us and seemed to receive the exact same service level as everyone else.

  Sea Bass w\/Drunken Noodle - Lightly crispy on the outside and super flaky on the inside. Paired very well with the noodles and the flavors were well balanced. Worth trying, but definitely small for the price ($30 I think?). I'll be trying something else next time.
  Crispy Duck w\/Panang - Very yummy! You get to choose your spiciness level from 1-10 so I got 8. The spiciness wasn't spaced out very evenly, as the first couple of scoops of sauce\/duck were very spicy and the last few bits weren't spicy at all. The sauce was delicious with rice, but I think I'll try the dish with mint and chili instead. I feel like the sauce made the duck less crispy. 

AMBIANCE
Looks very unassuming from the outside. You would never know that such a great restaurant was located inside an old plaza like this. The restaurant itself is pretty large as they bought out the space next door and expanded. They even have a wine cabinet\/wall displayed with TONS of wine to choose from. Everything from the decor to the music is pretty Asian\/traditional.

I kind of feel bad that I recommended going here for a friend's birthday since they love Thai food lol. 

I ended up ordering beef panang and thai iced tea. The panang was not that great because I didn't really taste much of the spices. The only thing that was apparent was the spiciness, but that gets kind of boring after the 5th bite or so. I've been to some hole in the wall Thai places which had better panang than this place. I did get to sample some dishes that my friends ordered and I have to say the pad thai and curry with duck was really good. They kinda skimped out on the curry and duck though! I guess you could order that if you don't have a big appetite. I love thai tea and always get it when dining in, so this experience was no exception. Was kinda bummed that not only was the thai tea ordinary, but it paled in comparison to some other places I've been to. 

I'd say this place is worth visiting, but do take your time to read the reviews and see what people recommend on ordering. Also, this place is located in a shady area so don't go alone! I MAY come visit another time, but only if my friends really want to check it out again lol. This is one of the few places I'd say is more based on hype rather than quality of food.",11,7,7

I sampled several things from Spicy Wings, stuffed chicken wings, peppered chicken, crispy duck, to the Northern Larb. I loved every dish just as much as the last and that is rare for me.

There is a reason Chef Chutima won the the James Beard award a few times, most recently in 2011 for SouthWest best Chef.  The food here is creative and exquisite.  Simple things like the Chicken Satay, is transcended.  It had a moist and delicate taste.  One could even skip the peanut sauce on it.  The Chile spicy wings hit on a lot of notes.  It was sweet and savory at the same time.  The skin was crispy and crunchy and the meat was cooked perfectly.  The Garlic Prawns had a lot of crunch and great garlic taste, without overpowering.  It was like eating little lobsters deep fried to heavenly perfection.  The Stuffed chicken was surprising great.  It was moist and tender on the inside, with the crispy Panco crust on the outside.  The combination Fried rice was flavorful and not greasy.  The best has to be their red dip, Nam-Prik-Ong!  It the flavor profile hits on so many notes.  You can't beat pork on pork (use the pork rinds).  it starts off crunchy and salty.  Then it steps up to hit of sweet and savory.  It finishes with a spicy note at the end of the journey.  I HIGHLY recommend.  It is probably one of the best dishes on the menu.

It is not located in the best area, a bit off the beaten path.  I think that is why it makes it so extraordinary.  One would not think to find such a ray of light in an otherwise shady part of town.

Satay ($9.95) was fine -- it comes in beef, pork, or chicken, but the restaurant does not allow you to mix and match.  I would pass.  Stuffed chicken wings ($10.95) were better -- juicy and a nice portion for two.

Garlic Prawns ($21.95) were excellent, as was the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle ($29.95).  Both are deep-fried so skip sides or unnecessary carbs.  The prawns come with white rice, and the drunken noodle is more than adequate.  Portions are not huge but are filling.

The food is definitely overpriced!  The garlic prawns are $25!  The plate didn't have that many prawns on them!

We experienced this little gem on a Friday night and, at least that night, I'm glad we had reservations. The restaurant was packed. So, consider yourself warned ... we were told they would only hold reservations for five minutes. You snooze, you lose.

The restaurant is somewhat casual, so shorts and a tee-shirt would have sufficed, but a few of our group of four were dressed for a show and gambling at one of the upscale properties. Each of us would have felt comfortable either way.

The delight of Lotus of Siam is not the decor or the layout; it's the food. Sooooo good. And there are more selections than one might need -- but who's to complain?! We ordered four entrees: Garlic Prawns (at the suggestion of the server); Chicken Panang; Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles (again, at the suggestion of the server); and Pineapple Fried Rice.

All were excellent choices. The Garlic Prawns topped with ground black pepper were oh-so-lightly deep fried in their paper thin shells. No need to peel these crispy little delicacies -- eat 'em shell and all! The Chicken Panang contained plenty of thinly sliced chicken breast medallions soaking in a heavenly, light curry\/coconut\/basil\/chili sauce. You may need to keep the sticky rice bowl handy, as the Panang and sticky rice mix well together. The Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles had a nice contrast of flavors between the fresh chili and Thai basil, while the fish itself maintained the mellow flavor characteristic of good sea bass. And, finally, the Pineapple Fried Rice containing curry powder, pineapple, shrimp and chicken was a good little addition -- especially with the contrast of the pineapple to the traditional Thai flavors of the other entrees.

I can't eat Thai food without a Singha lager beer, which I enjoyed. Others in my group shared a bottle of wine from a reasonably long list of wines from various areas of the world. (They selected a Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand -- which at least is from the same hemisphere as Thailand!)

Sea bass was really on point. Such juicy pieces cooked to perfection. Garlic prawns, nice and deep fried (which makes it so easy to eat the head).

We ordered the golden tofu and chicken satay as an app. Tofu was pillows of hot, fried goodness and the chicken satay was perfectly grilled and moist. Luckily the appetizers kept our tummies from screaming because the wait for our main dishes took much longer than I hoped (about 35 min).

The crispy duck curry was the main star of the meal even though they got the order wrong initially and sent us braised short ribs instead. Our server fixed the problem promptly. The northern larb was a second favorite. Pad see ewe was good, but nothing to write home about and their pineapple fried rice had more curry flavoring than I'd prefer. By the end of dinner, I was beyond stuffed and slightly disappointed that I didn't save room for dessert. 

Oh well, there's always next time.",0,0,0

the only thing that kills me abut that place is the decor, like seriously rip up the 10 year old green stained carpet please!!!! put fake hardwood floor or re due the carpet please. it makes the room so dark and puts a downer on the experience. service was a little slow that day due to the room being busy but every one was apologetic and friendly, and thats all i need. not expecting 5 star service at this type of spot. 

so happy with lunch that day and def going back. heard about this place so many times and been here for 9 years, such a mistake not going way back when i heard about this spot. big menu so if you are going for the first time i would recommend the last 2 pages which is the chef selections. a little more $$ but totally worth it.

Well, I was in town visiting from San Francisco over Memorial Day weekend, and Jay knew I'm a bit of a foodie, so he mentioned Lotus of Siam early in the trip as a ""must go"" place to dine. We finally went the last night I was in town, and I was seriously blown away at how amazing the food was. And for the price, you honestly cannot beat it! 

I would be remiss without also mentioning their rather extensive and nicely executed wine list. Coming form the Bay Area, that is a must, and LoS did not disappoint. 

In short...for details, read Jay F's review - otherwise, trust me when I say, GO TO LOTUS OF SIAM - you will thank me for it...at least until you're finding yourself craving it and being 1000 miles away...

OF course when I first heard of it I was excited but skeptical due to the wait time and hoping it is not just a hype place. I arrived around 545pm on a Sunday night and people were already seated enjoying their food. The hostess told me the wait time was 2 hours. oh boy, theres always tat decision to whether find something else or to wait. We decided to put our name down and the hostess told us there is a waiting room in the back. They also have the app where we enter our phone numbers and they would let us know when the table is ready. We also were able to see the wait time on the website thats linked to their app. GENUIS ! The waiting room definitely made waiting more bearable. About 3 hours later we finally got our table. We already decided on which dishes we were going to order. 

Garlic Pawns: of course were a must ! This came in about 6\/8 pieces and the whole shrimp including the shrimp was edible, just make sure you chew slowly. 

Crispy Duck ( Khao Soi): I have never had this before at a thai restaurant but it was so good! Definitely need to eat this with rice. The dish was full of flavors and it all complimented well with one another. 

Tom Kah Kai:(hot pot for the bigger portion) I love Thai soup! this had coconut base to it and it was so delicious. the cream of the coconut balanced the sourness of the soup. highly recommend ordering this soup dish. 

Thai fried rice: this one was okay,  I wish I chose a more exciting fried rice. 

Thai Spagettii: We had a party of 6 so we each had to get a little bit to try. The noodles were cooked to al dente and the flavors of the sauce was gentle and not overly powered by it. 

Fried stuff chicken: this was an interesting dish. It was stuffed with mushrooms\/ chicken\/ and veggies. The sauce it came with was what topped off the dish. 

Nam Kao Tod: This is the duck curry.. let me tell ya ...I wish they had a bucket of the curry ! The dish came with some noodles but of course wishing they added more. The curry sauce was so good over rice. This dish was not overpowered by the curry and the duck was good perfectly so where it was soft. The curry flavor was infused in to the duck pieces. 

Had a little room for dessert so we opted for the Fried Banana with coconut ice cream. The banana was fried in what seem like the skin of an egg roll and topped with some cold creamy coconut ice cream! The temperature of the banana was perfect to add the ice cream on top. perfect crunch\/ sweetness \/ and goodness. 

Highly recommend if you can make reservations to this place!

Forget the strip and come here to eat! I had the pad Thai, crispy garlic shrimp, issan sausage, drunken soft shell crab and let me tell you THE BEST MEAL I HAD IN VEGAS. First let me rave about the duck Panang curry( KHAO SOI) My mouth is watering just thinking about the crispy duck breast with the rich 6\/10 spicy Panang curry. It's rich, creamy, and the spice just create a symphony in your mouth. The curry itself is just perfect alone and the duck makes it 100x better! I mean renowned chefs like Ming Tsai and Anthony Bourdain say it's perfection, then best believe it's perfection as its finest. Now let's continue with the crispy garlic shrimp. Its cooked properly, crispy on the outside, and sweet and juicy in the inside like how a perfect shrimp should be. Order the KHAO SOI and drizzle that sauce in the crispy shrimp with some rice that comes with the KHAO SOI and you will be in food heaven. Next is there handmade issan sausage, I wasn't really a fan of it. I found it a bit salty to my liking but it's one of the famous dishes to order. The drunken soft shell noodle was nothing that special as well as their pad Thai. Moving to dessert! I would love to mention how great their coconut ice cream is!

Only one place fitting enough for this meal; Gourmet Magazines number one Thai restaurant in North America. 

It's unpretentious in an unassuming neighborhood. Looks can be deceiving, be prepared for a true culinary adventure.  This isn't your average neighborhood Thai restaurant.  Tamarind paste, not ketchup in the pad Thai.

Tip:  The menu is huge.  Expert on Thai food, study it in advance else let the servers guide you.  Allow the servers to suggest spice levels as well so dishes compliment not over power each other.

The meal usually consist of numerous dishes served at once.  It create a play of complimenting and contrasting flavors that collectively make the experience. If forced to find standout dishes:

Issan Sausage (a grilled sour pork sausage.  The natural sweetness of the pork shines through in this simple yet perfectly balanced sausage).

Sua Rong Hai (broiled beef tenderloin in a spicy, sweet sauce.  Tender with the spices bringing out the sweetness of the beef).

Plar Dook Kar-Prow Krob (Deep fried whole catfish topped with sautéed fresh chili, garlic, and basil.  Earthy, fiery, absolutely delicious against the crisp, slightly overcooked catfish).

Charbroiled prawns (Extra large prawns grilled and served with a spicy, tangy tamarind sauce.  Beautiful balance again with the spices heightening the natural sweetness of the prawn.  The charbroiling adds a good bitterness).

Garlic prawns (lightly battered, deep fried with shells on in a fresh, peppery garlic sauce.  Just good eats).

Massive wine list (Wine Spectator Best Award of Excellence) with over 600 selections.  Heavy emphasis on Germany and France (Rieslings).  Very inexpensive.

And to the annoying ladies dining next to us commenting on our unrefined choice of utensils and wasteful over ordering:  (1) Thai etiquette dictates you use your fork to put food on your spoon and only put your spoon in your mouth,  (2) you don't ask for chopsticks, and (3) it is rude not to leave some food on the serving dishes and your plate.

Always a great culinary adventure.",30,19,25

* Reviewers warn against the buffet, which is standard Chinese.  From what I saw, I'll second that view.  Order interesting Thai food from the menu.  Be sure to ask for the Northern menu, which has many good choices as well.
* I had Nam Kao Tod (minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanut, and lots of crispy rice); charbroiled catfish; sticky rice with mango.  It was a lot of food, and everything was very good.
* The food tends to be very, very hot.  Fortunately, you get to specify how spicy you want things.  Your waiter will ask you how hot you want your food on a scale of 1-10, where 10 is the hottest.  I ordered level 3 to be safe, and it was still pretty hot.
* The address is on Sahara Avenue.  However, that's the BACK of the restaurant.  Don't run away in horror; instead, drive around to the other side.

The menu is large. Too many choices. ""Quality over quantity,"" as it's said. I would have appreciated the server spending more time recommending traditional Northern Thai dishes, but perhaps I'll have to go when they can spare the attention. 

We ordered quite a few dishes, but not one came out at a temperature that didn't lead you to believe it was sitting in front of a fan on a hot summer day.

Spicy Chicken Wings
Issan-style Beef Jerky
Tom Yum Kai
Seared Scallops with Chili Basil Leaves
Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab
Garlic Prawns
Braised Short Rib with Panang
Crispy Duck with Panang

I don't like to request my dishes be brought back for any reason, but I find the taste of cold fried food incredibly off-putting. The prawns were the only dish I asked of. It would have felt exhausting to request every dish be reheated. And then there's the question of ""how?"" How are you warming my dish? In a microwave, or are you sparing a few precious minutes in a wok?

Business is good for Lotus of Siam thanks to the celebrity visits. Maybe with some extra funds they'll invest in better warming lamps for their dishes, or teach their chefs\/runners how to better coordinate the timing sending food out. There's so much potential; I know it and I want to believe it. For this reason I'll go back and try again.

You can tell LoS was born from a small mom and pop restaurant that has been expanded to meet demand, and blossomed through word of mouth alone. This is not a calculated restaurant, and reputation was built on the merit of the food. Pulling into the dilapidated strip mall parking lot, I had a small tinge of ""where the hell are we?""

The garlic prawns feature Jurassic-sized shrimp, the shells peeled so they dangle by the same tail -- battered and deep-fried for a garlicky crunch. 

The Khao Soi curry was a bright curry with egg noodles, light on coconut milk, cut with lime juice. Highly recommend getting it with the roasted duck -- where the fat has been carefully rendered down so that each piece is crunchy and moist without excess fat. Tastes like they cut up duck confit to add to their curry.

The Tom Yum and Tom Kai soups were very complex, but very concentrated. Sharply sour, incredibly spicy (despite a ""medium"" level of spiciness.. they are NOT messing around). 

Admittedly, the papaya salad -- while good in its own right -- was a little under developed compared to the other dishes. The papaya wasn't thoroughly beaten to soften it, and thus was unable to really take up the flavor of the dressing. Can't win them all!

Order some kind of curry - Khao Soi with duck, panang, red, green, or yellow... They're all packed with flavor and amazingly delicious.

I asked for recommendations, and the waiter recommended drunken noodles, and duck panang curry. I was a little disappointed because the dishes sounded ordinary, and I felt like he may have assumed we were not adventurous by our appearances. I may go back and order dishes off the northern menu, or make it clear I'm adventurous. 

Anyway, off of recommendations online and from the waiter we got the garlic prawns, crispy rice, and duck with masaman curry. 

The crispy rice really didn't appeal to me. It tasted overwhelmingly of ginger and even had large strips of ginger in it. A little ginger goes a long way! It also had too much lemon grass. Eating it made my mouth fatigued and overwhelmed and not in a pleasant way at all. The sausage was really not good. The flavors just weren't balanced and the texture of the rice was good but not great. The pig skins in there were very good - I wish there had been more. 

The garlic prawns were really not good either. the shrimp meat was overcooked, but my main complaint was the flavor. The fried shrimp shells were very interesting and the texture was pleasing, but there was just no flavor in the dish at all besides black pepper and an oily fried food taste. Some kind of dipping sauce would have been ideal, but proper seasoning might have been enough to make it good. I kept dipping it in the red curry that came with but I would've preferred something acidic or sweet. Really ANYTHING to balance out the oily taste. It was served over slaw, but that was not dressed either - it was just there to catch the excess oil. 

The duck dish was very good. The duck was excellent, but I don't think it paired that well with masaman curry. I would order this again with a different sauce. It was silly of me to order the curry because, c'mon, you can get that kind of curry anwhere! But the curry tasted good. It didn't blow my mind, and I would've preferred if it wasn't broken. Overall, very disappointing. It wasn't worth the stomach ache of three deep fried dished, that's for sure!

Last weekend I was in Vegas and our second (and last) night there, we wanted to eat out for dinner again. Again I eyed the local restaurants on yelp and this actually was my second choice. We actually tried to go to this Italian place, but the area was just creeeepy. FAIL. Lol so we let the GPS take us to Lotus of Siam.

I didn't know what to expect because I've been to many Thai places and I only really like a couple. I'm really picky about little aspects of food, but I wanted to be open-minded, especially because my stomach was empty =(. So the wait was 10 minutes, which went by pretty quick! My parents were surprised to find the place PACKED, but we snagged a table at the right time.

We were seated in the mini dining rooms on the side and it was pretty cozy. But more importantly, I wanted some real good food. We ordered:

Pad Thai - Not the best I've tasted, and personally was a little small and a little dry. But pretty good.

Spicy Fried Rice - What the hell?! No one asked how spicy we wanted it?! This shit burned our stomachs and my thai iced tea was goooone. I love spicy food but they were literally trying to start a fire in my throat. Tasty nonetheless!

Chili Mussels - Pretty good, but I'm not too big on mussels. My dad liked it though.

Musaman Curry - The tastiest curry ever. We got it with tofu and it was really good. I was bummed the bowl was so small.

Service was pretty good too, so that of course is a plus. But because I'm real picky about my food (well at least when I went there), it didn't get the 5 stars I was really hoping to give. Great place though, and from the looks of it this place is loved by many. If I'm in Vegas again, I'll definitely come by again. And I'll be prepared for the fried rice!",1,0,1

Long story short, I wouldn't recommend this place for lunch or for the buffet because not only was the food meh but the service was horrendous.

When we got there, the host asked how many were in our party to be seated. We told them that our friends were already here and asked if they minded if we took a quick peek around the corner to see if they were seated already. The host said no problem and we walked past him. After looking for about 5-10 seconds, he walks back in front of us and says ""maybe they're not here yet"", as if to call us liars and try to seat us anyways. We walked back towards to entrance to call our friends to see where they were. The host follows us around the whole time as if we're not allowed to walk freely in the lobby. He continued to challenge us even after I told him nicely that our friends had texted us that they were seated somewhere inside before we even walked in. We eventually found our party, which had been seated towards the back. We ignored the host and just made our way towards them. 

After being seated it was impossible to get someone to stop at our table to ask questions about the buffet and menu. I thought about ordering off the menu,but my group wanted to go for the buffet, so I thought why not? Once we started eating, the only time we saw a server was when we needed refills on water and soda. No one ever stopped by to ask us how we were doing or took our plates. I even grabbed some plates and threw them on an empty bar where nobody was sitting because they were piling up. I also had to get up and grab my own sauces and napkins from the waiters' supply corner...no customer service whatsoever, but this is an Asian restaurant so who knows if they even care. There was also not very many people there for the noon lunch hour compared to what you would expect when experiencing a lapse in service. Maybe 2\/3 of the restaurant was full if even. Had the restaurant been completely full, I would've taken that into account. There was also some confusion when we were paying our bill so it seems like the hostess' don't know what they're doing either.

The buffet featured items such as chow mein, pad thai, garlic wings, mint chicken and other typical buffet foods. The selection was small as there were only 2 tables worth of food. Most of the food was bland (pad thai especially) and some of the fried items were 90% dough and not much filler (egg rolls, fried banana are examples). The only thing that I really ate more than a couple bites of was the chow mein and garlic wings...show I really just filled up on wings. Not really what you would expect at a Thai restaurant.

While I was eating, I was already thinking about how I was going to word this review because I was unhappy the entire meal. Keeping in mind that it was only the buffet that we had, makes me want to go back and try ordering items from their menu. However, the service was a real turn off and I've had better service at fast food joints than what I had today at Lotus. I doubt we'd be back in the future. Not sure how this place got their Zagat rating because I'm pretty sure service counts for something.",7,2,0

The flavor of the curry was great and wasn't just spice. The noodles and pickled vegetables were a good balance to my palate. Great dish.

Following the Yelp reviews, I tried:
1) Garlic Prawns - pretty decent! You can also eat the crispy shells. Wish it had a bit more toasted garlic. Order a side dish to go with it, otherwise, it might feel greasy. 
2) Nam Kao Tod - WAY TOO salty, too sour.
3) Egg noodles that I forgot the name of (first dish under Northern cuisine page) Apparently, this place is popular for their northern thai cuisine. So we tried dish #1, recommended by the waiter. It was just OK - overly creamy and much of the same taste. I can't tell how authentic it is since I'm not Thai.
4) Thai iced tea - too sweet

This place has so many dishes - it's difficult to choose what to order. I really want to try their sea bass, charboiled prawns, and fried whole catfish with ginger. All with beer. My advice to you will be: get what you want, not necessarily what other Yelpers have reviewed.

My friends raved about this place so we had to check it out.  It is a big place but it gets packed.  So, make reservation.

We ordered the special crispy duck with panang curry sauce, Thai fried rice, chilli mint catfish, ground pork, chicken curry, and stuffed chicken wings.

The crispy duck is really really delicious! It is a must try! We did pay $20+ for 6\/7 small slices of duck meat tho. 

The spicy chilli catfish was just ok.  It cost us $15 for literally 5\/6 small pieces of fish.  The chilli mint ground pork tasted good but the serving portion was so small that we were almost upset.  Seriously, ground pork costs nothing.  Fried rice was good but nothing special.

We did have the sticky rice and mango dessert.  It is to die for.

Overall, food is decent but prices are not acceptable for Thai food.  I would suggest you go for the Chef's specials such as the crispy duck and beef stew.  They are all over $20 a dish but at least they are special.  Don't order the typical Thai food that you can get it somewhere else at a much cheaper price.

We probably won't go back because all we really did was loading up on steam rice so we didn't have to leave hungry.",0,0,0

My group came in few minutes after they open to avoid the long line. You bet there were people already dining at that time. The restaurant itself is quite nice and the service was great. All dishes were presentable but taste wise was completely different from what I thought.

We ordered the typical dishes that almost everyone would order when you go to a Thai place.

Pineapple Fried Rice: it was literally 1 bowl of rice. The rice was not bad but lack of pineapple and meat.

Beef Salad: I did not like how saucy they made this dish. It gives the salad a weird taste to it. And the beef proportion is more than salad, which others might like but not me!  

Pad Thai: The only dish that I have no complaint with. It was your typical pad thai where you can order anywhere. 

Pad Sew Ew: This is a simple dish. Noodles, meat and some sauce. It does look like other pad sew eww dish but the flavor was completely different. As if they put curry flavor in it or something.",1,3,0

Crispy catfish with basil (4\/5) - I had this dish twice in 2 occasions. First time it was really good, catfish was crispy and the sauce was on point. Second time the catfish was a bit soggy (maybe they didn't immediately serve it once it was cooked?). I would have given it 5\/5 otherwise.

Crispy rice salad (4\/5) - Tasty. One of the better crispy rice salad I've had.

Duck panaag (5\/5) - This duck curry was INSANELY good. In fact. this is probably one of the top 3 curry-based dish I've tasted ever. The duck was juicy, delicate, and soaked in the sweet savory umami liquid. Get it.

Compared to the other restaurant I went to, this is, in fact, not the best Thai food in the United States, nor even in Las Vegas.  Going by taste alone, I enjoyed my dinner, but having ordered the exact same thing elsewhere, it did not match up.  It should not matter what menu I order from, if something is served on the menu from a restaurant touted as the best in the United States, I shouldn't have to limit myself to a particular item or set of items to taste this quality.

The location, as others have mentioned, is absolutely horrible.  Off the strip on Sahara, it's hidden away in an area that makes me feel uncomfortable every time I go there.  The interior was nothing special and did not stand out to me...seemed quite unauthentic, way to strip-mallish, but alas I've never been to Thailand, I would not know what is truly authentic.  We happened to sit nearby a group who met with the owners, who both seemed nice but Bill was quite dressed down for whatever he was doing that evening (sweatshirt and sweatpants...not quite what I was expecting).

The Nam Prik Ong was a bit more mellow, but still had plenty of flavor and lots of different textures thanks to the different dipping options.

The garlic shrimp is an amazing dish, but there's a certain amount of technique that was missed on our order that went out. The shells were perfectly crisp to give that ""potato chip"" texture other reviewers rave about, but the resulting prawns were desiccated and rubbery. We didn't even finish the dish.

I made the reservation about 3 months ago, as you can't get in on a short notice (yes, you can wait for about an hour on the normal day, probably not during the CES).
The restaurant is located in the large strip mall, with plenty of parking space (however the area looks extremely warned down).
As you walk in you find a very simple interior - very appropriate for the Thai restaurant but totally not influenced by the recognition the restaurant enjoys.
The restaurant offers a full wine list with about 300 different wines. By the glass selection is quite good on its own.
The menu is very substantial, offering lots of different variants of Thai cuisine. As many others recommended before me, it might be suggested to preview the menu before coming to the restaurant to avoid being overwhelmed at the table.
As you know, Thai cuisine can be very spicy. Unlike many typical Thai restaurants, which only have mild, medium and hot, Lotus of Siam offers 10 levels of spiciness. I like spicy food but within reason - at Lotus of Siam I had dishes with spiciness level 3, 4 and 5, and they were all reasonably okay. I also tasted level 10, and for the taste, it was good, but I wouldn't eat the whole dish at that level.
I started with Tom Yum Goong soup which was excellent. Northern Thai mushroom deep was also very tasty, served with vegetables to be used as chips.
My main dish was Drunken Noodle with seafood. Noodles were very interestingly cooked and had almost charred flavor, quite unusual, but tasty. What was a bit of a put down for me were 3 large chunks of crab meat imitation sticks which I'm sure not used in the Thai cuisine and really don't belong at all at the authentic restaurant - either do without them, or put at least a piece of fish.
Sticky rice with mango was excellent for dessert, and coconut ice cream was delicious.
Overall, this was an excellent meal, but I really didn't feel that it was that amazingly special - I would gladly join someone to eat there again, but wouldn't crave it for myself.
Very good, attentive and helpful service.

First was the tom yum kai soup at medium spiciness.  The soup was good, had a fair amount of chicken, but was missing in straw mushrooms.  Before we had much time to enjoy the soup, two more dishes were brought out.  So much for spacing.

The first was nam kao tod which the menu describes as crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice.  The crispy rice were very present but cubed pork was almost flavorless.  The dish was really lacking.  Along with this, we were served the nam prik ong, spicy red chili dip served with vegetables and some fried pork rind.  The chili was flavorful and I found putting it on the rinds was the best way to eat it.  Crunchy texture and heat.

We were then brought the khao soi with beef and the thum ka noon with chicken.  Both dishes were OK.  The winning dish was the khao soi.  Very flavorful with outstanding noodles.  This was one of two dishes that were very good.  I thought the thum ka noon was watery and didn't have a lot of flavor.  

The one dish which was the other star of our meal was forgotten.  We had to have our server come back to the table and remind him that we had ordered the garlic prawns.  We were brought our order.  The prawns were good and the crispy outer shells very delightful.

I had a diet Coke which was refilled several times without asking.  Service was good but I wish they had spaced the dishes out more so we had a little more time with each dish.  

This was my second time at Lotus of Siam.  I think I'd be back only if I wanted to try something different in Thai food.  It was disappointing.",11,5,6

First off, if you're from out of town, you might get lost trying to locate this place.  The GPS dings but where the hell is it?!  After circulating the street for a while...AHAA there it is!!  It's located right behind the main street in a sketchy strip mall.  It would have helped if they light up their sign on the big street or cut down the tree blocking it (I say fix the freakin' sign).  But no worries, this place has no shortage of patrons.  There was a long line even on a weeknight.  We waited close to an hour.  Normally I would not wait to eat this kind of food but I was with family and one of them was craving Thai.  During our wait there was a car getting broken into.  Wait, did I already say the location is sketchy?

SERVICE:  Bad.  We asked for extra spoons that never came.  The food took 30 minutes to come out.  While fuming, I saw two ladies who got seated way after us getting their food first.  And they actually had the audacity to tip themselves 18%!

FOOD:  mediocre at best!  We had the usual pad Thai, pad see ew, rad na, Thai fried rice, etc., and there was nothing special to write home about.  And the portions are tiny!  Growing up in southern CA where there's no shortage of Thai restaurants, I'm use to leftovers.  We left hungry because we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes to order extra.  And oh yeah, it's expensive.  Not worth it and I won't be coming back.",2,3,1

Wait time can be around 2 hours, so try to come on an off time or near closing. We came around 9:30, when their last seating is at 10, and were seated right away. I called at 8 the same day, and the wait time was 1.5 hours. 

It's known by celebrity chefs as ""the best Thai restaurant in America."" Their menu is extensive, it probably has at least 100 items of main courses. I love that they include northern Thai dishes, such as Khao Soi, which is so difficult to find near me. So don't get Pad Thai here -- try something new!

The 2 dishes people rave about here are their Crispy Garlic Prawns and the Crispy Duck Panang Curry. These were under ""Chef's Choice,"" and cost around $30. Pricy. Everything else was a more reasonable $10ish. 

I would not order the prawns again. They're basically just really crispy prawns, and I'm not sure what the hype around it is. 

The crispy duck, on the other hand, is the best duck I've ever had. And being an Asian American, I've had my fair share of duck. Crispy skin, moist meat. How do they do it?? Even Anthony Bourdain (or was it Andrew Zimmerman??) was in awe of how they cooked it. He said something along the lines of ""2 top chefs with over 50 years of experience between them can't figure it out."" 

I was sharing the crispy duck dish with my boyfriend, and sometimes we will fight over the good pieces (jokingly, of course). This time, I intentionally chose the worst piece just to see... and it was STILL AMAZING. 

I will DEFINITELY be back to try the other dishes! I wish I had the stomach to try more!! Or I wish I didn't order the prawns, so I could try 3 other plates.....lol regrets",0,0,0

2. drunken noodles
3. salty Thai lemonade 
4. Northern larb (ground pork with lime juice)
5. panang curry (delicious!)

7. crab fried rice (the best I've ever had!)
8. nua nam tok - sliced beef with lime juice 
9. prawns with super spicy green chili lime sauce on a bed of cabbage - this dish was way too sour for me but my friends loved it

Just some advice, I got here at 5:25 and there was already a line, they open at 5:30pm. It wasn't bad but it was a Tuesday.. so I can imagine on the weekends it can get crazy. So on to the food..

I started off with what I always start off with at any Thai place..

Tom Yum w\/ Shrimp - This is the first thai place that i've been too that asks how spicy you want your Tom Yum.. 1-10 I got a 7 and it was decent, had a nice little kick to it.  The soup was super flavorful and probably one of the best Tom Yum soups i've had. 

Fried Rice with sour sausage - Bomb.. this had alot of crazy flavors and textures going on.  A tad bit sour but not too much, crunchy peanuts, and lots of veggies mixed in made this dish amazing.

Pad See Ew - This dish was nothing special whatsoever.  It was lacking in flavor and I would not get this dish again.  Very average.. 

CRISPY DUCK w\/ DRUNKEN NOODLES - this is supposed to be their best dish.. well the Crispy Duck is. You can have it different ways, I regret not getting the Crispy Duck in Panang Curry.. right before I walked in some caucasian guy told me that the drunken noodles was the best with crispy duck.. why did I listen to a caucasian guy at a thai restaurant when im asian and i've probably had more thai food then hes had in his entire life? I dont f**king know but I should have got it with panang curry, because I even asked the worker which is better and she told me panang is the most popular version of the crispy duck.

At an Italian spot it might be Pizza Margherita or Veal Parmigiana, For French food it might be Moules Frites or the Torchon of Foie Gras.  It's the dish that, if prepared properly, signals that the cuisine is up to par.  When trying to ascertain whether the full range of offerings is worth exploring it must first be determined that the kitchen can get the basics right.

My benchmark dish for any Thai restaurant is Tom Kha Kai, a magical combination of chicken, chicken broth, coconut cream, galanga, fish sauce, mushrooms, lime juice, and chili oil.  Ingredients may vary from spot to spot, as they often will, but the overall composition is pretty consistent.  The rub, as I have experienced it, is in getting the balance right.  Some places have too much coconut cream, others offer just a hint of chili oil (or omit it completely.)  I've had it with all kinds of mushrooms, and sometimes with huge chunks of galanga, and sometimes with none at all.  For one as obsessed as I, it grows a little tiresome.

I have had Tom Kha Kai at countless restaurants in the Southland, and am still looking for one that is as perfectly put together as what they serve at Lotus of Siam, the celebrated industrial park oddity way off the strip in Las Vegas.  Everything is in perfect balance and when I that first spoonful slides down my gullet I almost tear up a little.  Seriously.  It's just that feeling one encounters when something is SO right.. there's a magic to it.

The rest of the menu can be a little hit-or-miss, as others have noted.  But there is so much on the menu that is off-the-charts terrific that it hardly seems to merit de-starring.

So five stars for the crispy duck with spicy mint leaves.  Five stars for the Nam Kao Todd, crispy rice with minced sour sausage.  Five stars for the spicy beef salad.  So what if the Panag curry is a little lifeless?  There is certainly no shortage of items on this menu that make my head spin with delight.

And no, the decor is nothing to write home about.  I couldn't care less because the service is always so friendly and accommodating.  My blinders go on at Lotus and when I have an array of tasty treats in front of me I can't even SEE the decor.  Love really is blind, I guess.

And eleventy-billion stars for the wine list.  Jeez LOUISE the wine list.  Nothing, NOTHING goes better with spicy Thai cuisine than a cold bottle of Reisling and Lotus of Siam has scads of them.  Rare and highly rated selections at rock-bottom prices.  Donhoff.  J.J. Prum.  Zind-Humbrecht.  All the heavy hitters are represented, and there are plenty of Goldkapsels at near-release prices. Achtung! A perfect match for every dish can be found here along with a staff that can guide you through the polysyllabic minefield that one encounters with all things Germanic.

Stay away from the buffet.  Make a point of ordering some Northern dishes.  ABSOLUTELY order a bowl of the Tom Kha.  When visiting at night be sure to make a reservation and DEFINITELY arrange with your cab driver to pick you up after your meal because the parking lot gets a little bit sketchy after dark.  But for me, no trip to Vegas is complete without a visit to Lotus.  It's a can't-miss.",11,6,8

But since this is a buffet, I was hoping for some yummy curry...but they had chicken curry, which wasn't the flavorful kind that I have eaten.  I was disappointed to see so many chinese dishes on the buffet line (hot\/sour chicken, moo goo gai pan-type of dish, regular fried rice...).  One plate of food that I barely ate, I moved on to the fruits.  They do have fresh sweet fruit, I must say (watermelon, cantaloupe, pear, apple and oranges).  That made me a bit happier.

Don't let the shabby strip mall fool you, this Northern Thai restaurant is worth heading out to. You can tell that it is where the locals go.

The food came out hot and fast. We ordered A LOT. For many dishes you can choose your numbered spice level, so we often ordered a few of the same dishes at different levels. My favorite dish was the Garlic Prawns. These were full of garlic flavor, large and crunchy from being fried. Many in the group enjoyed the Crispy Duck in Panang Curry. The duck is served on top, and you mix it all into the curry. Crying Tiger Beef was another favorite of mine. While it was one of the more simple dishes, the thin beef was perfectly cooked to medium rare, and the jus on the side completed the dish. 

For dessert, I loved the Coconut Ice Cream. They make it with real coconut. It was so light and icy, almost a sorbet texture, while being full of coconut flavor. A great find and a great meal overall.",19,12,18

You can't go wrong with any dish here, which is what makes this restaurant so great. I'll admit, not every dish is amazing, but at least you won't be stuck with something yucky. It all just comes down to how much you love Thai food.

The wait is typically fairly long (waited 1 hour last time for a table for 3 on a Sunday night), but this time we only waited 15 minutes for a table on a Friday night. Luckily, tables for 2 typically get seated much quicker.

We ordered:
- Panang Curry: The curry had really good flavor, but I thought it was kind of plain. They don't give you any additional vegetables.

- Pad Thai: The noodles are different from your norm (they're thinner), but the flavor is good. I got mine with fried tofu and the fried tofu is really yummy! I normally don't like meats with my pad thai because they are normally made dry, but next time, I'll definitely try it with chicken. I don't think Lotus of Siam will disappoint.

Our party of four showed up on a Tuesday afternoon, seeking a change of pace. We ordered mostly from their northern-style Thai menu. 

Their Green chili dip was barely a tingle on my tongue, and I was expecting more of a bite and heat, when they warned us that it was spicy...

Their curry noodles was decent, as was their penang curry; but completely and utterly toothless in terms of spice.  And I'm not what you would call a hot head either. 

Skip the Tom Yum, since the base seems to be a chicken broth and not a true fish base and was missing the needed lemongrass in it... (was it because it was lunch and it was on the buffet?) 

The buffet looked ok, but how come it looked more like Chinese food and not Thai food? 

Their Thai iced tea was quite excellent, but their iced coffee was a tad too sweet.

I know this place gets rave reviews, but honestly, I don't think this is the best place to have Thai food, if you're seeking something with a bit of bite to it. I agree that the wine list is extensive, but definitely not a front-runner in my books for Best Thai of the year.",2,0,1

Besides, soft shell crab pad kee mao is good, but in terms of actual exoticness it's not really all that exotic.

The big problem is two-fold because I'm almost never here on a weekday. They only do lunch on weekdays, and I'm not dealing with that line for dinner time (and let's be honest, no one actually plans dinner in Vegas if you're gonna go out). EXCEPT LAST TIME I WAS HERE ON FRIDAY AT NOON. Sorry Tacos El Gordo, I love you much but my lunch choice that day was not a hard decision to make.

The reason you go to lunch is simple...you walk in with zero wait. At least that's what's happened the only two times I've been here! And the thing about Lotus is this...it is unquestionably the best Thai restaurant in the city of Las Vegas and arguably the best in the entire country. So you don't go in there with the intention of getting the basic options. Unless for some reason you are a basic person, in which case I hope the gods have mercy on your soul.

My ""get all the options you can't get anywhere else"" principle truly applies here. My friends were just like...dude, have at it, we trust you. Well, here's the list:

1. Crispy duck with penang curry: OMG IT'S THE BEST!
2. Soft shell crab pad kee mao (again): I know it's a tad basic, but hey it was really good last time. Besides, you don't really see soft shell crab on pad kee mao anywhere else...so don't judge me! Next time though...sea bass pad kee mao. Because of this next item.
3. Sea bass with chili sauce: Anyone that knows me knows I'm the biggest sea bass homer there is. This was so freaking good!
4. Chicken pad thai: Ok fine we got the most basic thing you can possible get. But that's because my friend says it's his favorite dish to cook and he wants to see how every restaurant cooks it since it's always different depending on the cook. He approves!

Yeah, everyone was satisfied. I think I know a thing or two about decent Thai food options here lol. And the great thing is that because the menu is so ridiculously deep, I could come here 5 times and never order the same combination of items. 

Only problem is actually finding time to come here again. I ain't trying to mess with that weekend line bruh.",4,3,5

There was pad thai, fried rice, chow mein, fried chicken wings, duck soup, egg drop soup, salad, fruit, egg rolls, banana rolls and a couple more items.

The selection is pretty limited and if you are looking for meat, you won't find it at the buffet but flavors were on point and for $10, I can't complain.

What I was really impressed with was the service. They are really attentive and friendly. Our glasses were always full and plates were taken away as soon as we were done with them.

This almost reminds me of the Singaporean dish ""Laska"" but dare I say this might have been a little closer to heaven. I'm salivating just thinking about it. 

Northern Larb (Pork: (9\/10) This dish was H-O-T and S-P-I-C-Y to the high heavens. Dear Lord. But it was so tasty and so good especially with a bit of lime and rice to accompany the dish. 

Panang Curry: (7\/10) This panang curry was good but was overshadowed by the Kao Soi dish. Tasted very similar but just not as good. The chicken was a tad dry and the portions weren't that great. 

Tom Yum Kai Soup: (5\/10) Honestly this soup was very bland and tasted like water with spice in it. 

Mango Sticky Rice: (10\/10): Perfect sticky rice and the mango was so sweet and ripe! One of the best mango sticky rice I've had - even compared to ones in Hong Kong\/Thailand

This restaurant located in an obscure mall somewhere outside of the Las Vegas Strip was a real diamond in the rough!

First off, their wine list was longer than their menu--which is a great sign because I believe that you don't need to have a great wine list unless you have great food first to match it.

We started out with the Tom Yum soup which was delicious and full of flavor and fresh chunks of mushrooms, but that was only the beginning.

Our second dish was the Fried Pompano and it was so well flavored and moist in the middle--not to mention probably one of the biggest pompano I have seen (I was expecting something considerably smaller) but still managed to be tasty and NOT dry as you might expect from a large fish for it's kind.

The third dish was the Crispy Duck w the Penang Curry--soo good, but so bad for you, but just generally sooo awesome!  It is as described by other yelpers so I will let their reviews make you drool.

In the end, the two of us left there happily stuffed and hoping that we will be back in Vegas soon to try more.  With all the great food in the bay area, not too many places outside northern California impress me, but I am a big fan of this place now and can't wait to get back there!

Dinner starts at 5:30 so we always try to come here a little earlier to beat the crowd and even then there's a line. Tonight got here at 5:30 and the wait was an hour. 

TIPS:
- Come at 5 to get in line so when they open at 530 you're first
- Or call for a reservation but their phone is always busy so try calling 1-2 days in advance. Also if you're not here within 5 mins of your reservation, you lose your spot

WHAT WE ORDERED TONIGHT: 
1. Crispy duck panang - THIS IS A MUST TRY. Every time we're here. We usually get this spicy since I think it enhances the flavor. This time we got medium and while still good, spicy would've tasted better. The sauce is AMAZINGG I don't waste a drop of it so once the duck is all gone I put some rice in the dish and mix it with the sauce and yummmm *___*
2. Tom yum soup- was not so yum. Not sure why but the last two times I've been here (tonight included) I wasn't very impressed with the soup. It tasted pretty bland and lacking in flavor. I've had better. This is why 4 stars 
3. Sea bass with drunken noodles - first time trying this and will definitely order this again the next time! 
4. Lamb (the waiter suggested this as it was the special) I personally am not a big fan of lamb so can't really give my opinion on whether or not it was good
And then the defaults:
5. Pad Thai - 4\/5 
6. Pad See Ew - my nephew hogged it all before I could get a taste but I didn't hear any complaints and he's very picky with his pad see ew!

The portions are not as big as other Thai restaurants I usually go to so if you're planning to share at the table, keep that in mind! We usually order as many dishes as there are people in our party and keep a menu on the side in case we're still hungry.

By the way, although the Commercial Center is still an iffy place at night, a local business group has been trying to turn this around.

Some reviewers must be judging this by their uniqueness.  I can understand if someone is jaded, they will find this an adventure but quite frankly its not that great.  Their duck curry is too sweet and their spicy sausage dish is way too acidic.  It appears to have flecks of ham in it instead of sausage but only the taste not description matters.

I think that their abililty to pair wines with the food must account for some of their esteem by some food critics.  They do have a good selection and the husband of the chef is not bad at wine recommendations.  One of my friends in New York who was knocked on her heels by Michelin's star for Devi told me this is sometimes a factor.  

However, there are at least 2 Thai restaurants in Vegas that I am sure most would find superior to LOS:  Pin Kaow and Archi with Komol not far behind.  Komol is in the same seedy center as LOS.  

This review is not based on their buffet which is not as bad as most reviews but a definite step below their regular menu.  I have eaten there 3 times, exhortations from visitors driven and have always been underwhelmed.

Still the best overall meal I have had in Vegas. Prices are getting to be ridiculous though.",3,0,0

I give it 5 stars on food quality, but the ambiance and atmosphere are most definitely lacking. Maybe it was the strip mall it's in. Maybe it was the crowded tables and disjointed service (four separate waiters? spilling water all over the place? 15 minutes for a thai iced tea?). Maybe it was our cab driver telling us that as recently as a few months ago, he would shoot up in the parking lot, as this was a well-known drug hang out, and he would not drive to this part of town after dark (that's a whole other story).

So if you're looking for some bomb ass thai food (and yes, it just might be the best in the country) and are willing to deal with some superficial shortcomings, this place is worth the trek from the strip.",2,1,2

We got the Seafood soup, Issan Sausage, Yellow Currey with Chicken, and Combination Fried Rice. All of that was delicious and the Seafood Soup had a great spice to it that I was not expecting at first. Be careful if you aren't used to spicy foods though as what you may called mild and order mild could possibly be too spicy for you which is what I saw happen to a friend. The waitress was nice enough to get him a drink for free to help get rid of the spiciness.

The tom yum soup, slightly different flavor from what we were used to, but it was still really good. Pad thai, not the very best, yet it still ranks up there. The other noodle dish, wasn't the best, that's probably why I couldn't remember the name of it. Lastly, the star of the show, the garlic prawns!

The smell of sewer is ripe.  There are meth addicts accosting you for change .  However, you have a mission.  The mission, if you choose to accept it, is to eat the best Thai food in North America.  I, and I hope you, choose to accept it!

I've eaten here twice.  The first time I got Tom kha kai and the special duck breast with drunken noodles.  The soup is INTENSELY flavorful.  The magic of Thai cuisine is the perfect balance of sweet, salty, sour, and piquant.  If you increase one, you have to increase the others.  Obviously, if you go overboard with any of them, the dish is ruined.  The soup was a perfect example of this philosophy - it was as flavorful as it could possibly have been.  If there was 1 more grain of salt, 1 drop of lime, it would have been too much.  The line of perfection is skirted so asymptotically, you'll think there IS no 99.99999999999%.

You'd think that, but you'd be wrong.  That extra 9 at the end?  The Tom yum goong will take you there.  Intense is all I can say - you cannot prepare your taste buds for the shock they will receive during a single bowl of this.  

The duck was cooked absolutely perfectly.  Crispy, delicious skin, perfectly rendered, tender meat.  The noodles were spicy, and perfectly complimented the duck.  

The Pla Laad Prik (whole fried fish with pepper sauce) was incredible.  It's exactly what it sounds like.  And it's delicious.

On top of all the incredible food (and to tame the heat, you are getting it spicy, right?), they have a huge list of Rieslings which are not only a perfect compliment to the meal, but are extremely reasonably priced.

I don't drive in certain parts of Sahara so, finding this place was a bit tricky.  

Our reservation last night was at 6pm and I heard the hostess say to one of the servers that they can't take any more reservations so, I was glad we called the night before.  When we got there, there were plenty of empty tables but sure enough, the place got busy in a matter of minutes.  The servers were scrambling and were trying to rush us.  I mean, they have a pretty huge menu (since they have dishes from different regions in Thailand) and making a quick decision wasn't that easy.

We got appetizers: nua dad deaw (beef jerky) and mee krob.  For entrees: beef panang, drunken noodle with soft-shell crab and kana moo grob (crispy pork with Chinese broccoli).  For dessert: fried banana and coconut ice cream with sticky rice.

Nua dad deaw: 
I'm not a fan of jerky but this was great.  You get about 8 pieces of beef that comes with a dipping sauce.  The jerky was flavorful so, no need for the sauce.

Mee krob:
Crispy noodles with chicken, shrimp, and sweet and sour sauce.  It was sweet and I enjoyed the crispy noodles.

Beef panang:
Tender pieces of beef with really good sauce.  The best I've had in Vegas.

Drunken noodle with soft-shell crab:
We ordered it spicy# 5 but we got about a #8.  I liked the flavor on the noodles despite the intense heat.

Kana moo grob:
I always get this at any Thai restaurant I go to.  The sauce was great, the pork was tasy and crispy and the broccoli fresh and crisp.  Again, the best I've had in Vegas.

Fried banana:
You get skinny fried rolls of fried banana with powdered sugar on top.  Nothing exciting.  I've had better.

Coconut ice cream with sticky rice:
It was ok but it would've been much better if mangoes were in season so we could've gotten mangoes with sticky rice instead.

Here is my opinion of this place. The food quality is pretty basic and authentic. Tastes like a home cook meal - dishes here are a bit more salty, like food made in Thailand. Regarding taste and authenticity I would rate this restaurant as a 2.5*. The prices is over priced. Price\/value is 2*. 

Here is what we had.

Hoh Mok Sea Bass (Hor Mok) - $29 - tastes authentic but lacks flavor. Needs to add some finely julienned kafir leaves - which I could not find present in my dish. This dish is normally cooked and served using a small clay pot. This restaurant cooks this dish inside a foil pouch. The top of portion of our Hor Mok, including the fish was somewhat dried (should have been more moist), while there is excess juice accumulated at the bottom of the foil pouch. (If I had known this, I could have tried to fix this by flipping the pouch for a while before flipping it back upright.... lol)

Garlic Prawns. $22 - I feel our shrimp was a bit too salty and over cooked, causing the shrimp to be dried up. The shrimp should not be deep fried for too long like they did at this restaurant. Once done properly you should get a juicy shrimp with a crispy coating on the outside. This dish is basically prepared in the same way as the Chinese salt and pepper pork chop.

Mango with sticky rice. the sticky rice was on the firmer side and not as tender and smooth tasting. Mango was fresh mango.",2,1,1

The food is awesome - everything I tried was exceptional and worthy of 5 stars. The stuffed chicken wing is the BEST - it is a chicken wing stuffed with pork and deep fried! What's not to love....Other favorites were garlic shrimp (the shells were the best part) and the crispy duck. My dining companion enjoyed her uber large bowl of noodle goodness. Great selection of German Riesling wines with some very rare finds at fair prices. The service is a bit spotty and I had to flag down some one on a few occasions.

On the way to the table i was taken directly past their amazing wine room and beautiful art which lined the walls. After my colleagues arrived, we ordered some apps to be shared family style.

1.KOONG SARONG ( Prawn in a blanket )
-Absolutely delicious! Marinated prawns wrapped with bacon and rice paper crepe, deep fried, served with sweet and sour sauce.
2.STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS
-Good. Chicken wings stuffed with ground pork deep fried, served with sweet & sour sauce. Without the sauce, the chicken was dry. With the sauce, Great!
3.NAM KAO TOD
-Awesome! Minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice. We got this dish at a 7 heat level and it went beautifully with our wine selection!

For my entree i ordered the GINGER FISH(refer to pic) which is a deep fried whole pompano fish, topped with ginger accompanied by a black mushroom sauce. This dish was really good. I stuck with a 4 heat level just to be cautious, and it definitely could have used more heat. The skin was perfectly cooked. With each bite of delicate flesh there was an even better crunch. The mushrooms added a nice earthiness to the dish which gave a great balance.

One of my colleagues ordered the SWEET & SOUR FISH(refer to pic) which is a deep fried whole pompano fish, topped with Thai style sweet and sour sauce. which he had no complaints about. 

Everybody at the table seemed to enjoy everything... all except my general manager. For his entree he ordered DUCK with some sort or mint and ginger(from what i can remember). Not only did it come out after all of our entree's, but it was cold. Now we had a situation where no one wanted to eat until everybody had their food. The person that didn't have their food was, of course, one of the people paying. HORRIBLE FEELING! He finally got his food, and it didn't seem like he was enjoying any of his meal after that.

For years, I had heard only great things about Lotus of Siam.  I have had my fair share of Thai food so I did not understand how one place could be so highly regarded.  While I could honestly say I was not blown away by anything I tried, I did enjoy the flavors and the service leaving me with a great dining experience.  Plus, their menu is pretty extensive so if I am in Vegas again, I am ready to make another trip to try some of their other items.

Here are some of the things that I tried on my first trip:

Nam Kao Tod: A crispy rice dish that sizzles with heat and flavor.  Each kernel of rice was almost fried to a crisp in an oil with a mixture of peppers and spices.  They provide several slices of cabbage and cucumber which help provide a nice counterbalance to the rice.  

Garlic Prawns: Given the high regard for these, here I was a little underwhelmed.  When the dish arrives, you will see the piece of meat hanging from the shell, all of which had been fried to a nice crisp.  While it smells absolutely like something you would come to expect from a dish called garlic prawns, the meat itself was a little lacking in that garlic flavor.  The true flavor actually came from the shell itself which was not necessarily as enjoyable to bite into.  

Roasted Duck Curry: A balance of spicy and sweet with generous pieces of duck make this a recommend.  Sure, in terms of flavor, it is what you would come to expect from your usual curries.  However, the actually chunks that were in the curry were impressive - fresh and vibrant. 

In terms of service, they were really great.  The servers were very attentive to our needs and would do things to make sure everything was okay.  The parking lot is huge so no worries about that but you may have to worry about the wait.  It is usually recommended to make reservations which is possible online.  If you are unable to secure a reservation online, you can put your name on the waitlist online as well.  Make sure to arrive on time or you risk losing your spot in line!

My friend had seen it on some travel show and also had an article highlighting it from a magazine. It was said to be the best Thai restaurant on the west coast. Well after I heard that I had to see if this was true.

We called to make reservations however they don't take reservations. We took a taxi from our hotel and let me warn you that this is off the beaten path. When we arrive it was about 8PM and I honestly thought we were in the wrong spot. It's located in an old strip mall. 

Upon entering we found that the restaurant was packed, that's always a good sign. We sat down and proceeded to order a bottle of wine, Rudi Pichler Riesling. It went very nice with the spicy red curry. I am not a big meat person and would rather not touch the stuff. I do make exceptions and this visit was one of them. My friends and I usually opt for family style dining when we go out. It's no surprise that meat is ordered but I tend to leave them alone. 

We had the Tum Yum soup (I remember this because yum= yummy) which had a little kick but was excellent. Next came the entrées, forgive me because I don't have the names. Red curry sauce with duck, and Pad Thai. Remember what I said earlier about meat? Honestly the duck dish was prepared and presented beautifully. I had to take a nibble. The meat was tender but the outside was breaded lightly. Great texture. The red curry was perfect because it wasn't overwhelming and went very nice with the duck. Pad Thai was the best because the noodles were not mushy as some places tend to over cook, and the flavor came alive in my mouth! (I need to go back, my mouth is watering just writing this.)

After dinner we finished with some Tozai snow maiden sake and some banana dessert. Both were an amazing finish to a perfect meal.",0,1,0

The pepper seeds through the dish let you know that this is a Thai serious dish and you better damn well order sticky rice to offset some of that fire ferocity. 

Lotus. A flow. A sweet, pretty pink flower. So innocent. So harmless. Has turned my mouth into a raving lunatic. I want to go back to Vegas...but not for the grand casinos and the sexy showgirls, but for the bacon wrapped shrimp and an entree so unbelievably piquant that I'll have to return...to know that the Lotus wasn't just a mirage.

There was nothing great about their thai food. These people that rave about this place must have not had good thai food. Also, quite honestly the reviews are coming from non-asian people. C'mon now, the food was mediocre and the proportion was only enough for 1 person; my 2 year old niece ate the curry dish all by herself. It was edible, but nothing out of this world like everyone else is talking about.  The only highlight of the evening was the bottle of wine we ordered.

I did a lot of research on what to eat and the people I went with don't eat fish but here is my take on our picks:

drunken noodles with minced chicken - the version on the menu is with seafood so you have to request it but I'm so glad I got it with the chicken instead! it complemented the noodles perfectly. the flavoring and everything was spot on and was probably my favorite dish of the night

spicy pork stew - this was probably the spiciest dish we had. we tried to keep the spice level at a low since one of our friends isn't a spice eater but it still definitely had a kick. out of all of the reviews I constantly saw this dish on the must try list. surprisingly, this was my least favorite dish. since the name has stew in it I figured there would be more of the curry sauce but it was mostly pieces of pork covered in a curry sauce. it was still good...but not a must try for me.

crispy duck with chili and basil - this is a must eat if you love duck. soooo good!!! it's mostly duck skin and very crispy.

cashew chicken - this was good but nothing special. I read that if you eat here and you want to be blown away you should stick to their specialties: northern thai food. so stay away from anything typical like pad thai or in this case cashew chicken. BUT it was still a delicious item and I had no complaints about it.

coconut ice cream with fried bananas and sticky rice - I had read that their sticky rice with mangoes is one of the top desserts in the US. Unfortunately, mangoes are not in season in the winter. I was sooo sad. But the waiter recommended this dish which blew us all away. the coconut ice cream was super refreshing and not too coconutty and the sticky rice was PERFECT. I'm drooling just thinking about it....

Thai Lime Drink - If you like limes you'll love this drink. It tastes like the vietnamese lime drink to me so it wasn't anything special cuz I drink it everytime I have pho but I love limeade so if you've never had it, definitely order this!

overall, we all had a great meal here and I will definitely be coming back to try some other dishes next time I'm in vegas. Is it the best hai food I've ever had? It might be! I will need to try some more dishes to be sure. The bad part is this place is closed for lunch on the weekends so plan accordingly.

My bf and I adored this place when we tried it for the first time last week. I can't believe we didn't try this place out sooner!! Service was so-so..but the food was great!

What we ordered:
- spicy chicken wings: DEEEELLISH! I think this was my bf's favorite. If you are in the mood for fried chicken wings, order this! It's fried wings covered in a sweet & spicy sauce so it's a bit sticky. These little things were just addicting and we loved every bite.

- drunken noodles w\/ seafood: yummy while it's hot! The first bite was amazing. I haven't had drunken noodles this good in awhile. It's more saucy than I'm used to but the flavor was all there. They didn't skimp out on the seafood either. Mussles, shrimp, scallop, & imitation crab [disappointed in the imitation crab but that's ok]. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the noodles stuck together after awhile so it got clumpy. Flavors were still good so I accepted it lol. 

- braised short rib w\/ panang: this was interesting. Decided to order it because of its popularity among yelp reviews. On the pricey side [~$17].. but it's braised short rib so I get it. I don't know if this is the best combination for my taste buds but I can see it growing on me. It's still good don't get me wrong and I might order it again. I think I would have liked it if the short rib was more moist..I think it was more on the drier side which is why I can't give it a glowing review. Maybe it was an off day..but that's just what I thought about it. 

I will absolutely come back the next time I'm in vegas. It's a must-stop!!!",3,1,2

First off let me say that it is in a strip mall that you would not ever go to unless you were going here. If you think to yourself on the way that ""this cannot possibly be the place"" then you are headed in the right direction. The good news is once you get there it's a totally different scene on the inside. Deceptively large and always busy, this place sports a really fine wine selection and some of the best Thai cuisine on the planet.

My friends who live in LV and have been to Thailand several times say it is the real deal for authentic and the menu is almost overwhelming with original Thai dishes. 

So for starters the Thom Ka is excellent, 1-10 spice scale and it comes in a hot pot with the flame going strong as it delivered to the table. It is certainly enough to share but of course you have to agree on the spice level. 

I am curry junkie so that's the route I usually go, and the Panang is my flavor of choice, no matter the meat I have not been disappointed ever with the quality. I have had Chicken and Shrimp Panang and both were excellent.

On one trip to Lotus we had a hard core vegan among us, this was no problem at all and they made everything to order just the way she wanted it and got really creative and used veggies and fruits that none of us besides her had ever heard of. 

I am always amazed at the shear volume of people coming through this place. On the weekend you cannot get in, they do take reservations but they normally don't answer the phone, as it is so busy so go during the week and expect a wait even then or eat later that seems to work too.

So go here and get anything you want, I would recommend this place for those new to Thai and veterans alike as everyone can get something they will love.",1,0,1

Every time I am in Vegas, I will make time to eat here.  You should make a reservation several days in advance, or you might be out of luck.  Not just a walk in place.  It is somewhat hard to find if you don't know where it is.  Some shopping strip center off of Sahara.

Their Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles is a great selection.  Try the crispy duck, this is to die for.  They will spice on a scale of 1-10.  If you like it real spicy, go to around an 8, if you still want to taste your food.  If you want all heat kick it up to a 10.  Medium is around 5-6. 

Prices are very much in line for the quality of food you get here.  Most dishes start out around $10, so come with several people and order a few dishes to share to get the best overview of their great food here.  

Service is real good.  Suggest to get an appetizer to hold you over, since you may wait for you food sometimes depending on how full they are.  Their soups are good to go with for an appetizer.

First off, it was quite a hike from where we live to the restaurant (45 minutes).  It is not located in a very pristine area.  In fact, questionable would be a nice word.  The only good part of the location is that it is in an outside shopping mall.  As a result, there were plenty of parking.  When we arrived, there were not a lot of cars there.

We made reservations for Friday @ 5:30pm (opening time).  By the way, MAKE reservations.  Otherwise, good luck on getting a table.  When we got there, there already was a line about 15-20 people deep.  That is a great sign.  Somehow, people waiting outside kinda reminds me of the Disney flick\/cartoon -- Ratatouie (you know at the end of the movie where the crowd is waiting to get in).  By the way, if you do not have reservations, depending on how busy they are, you may be turned down.  They turned a few people away due to ""no availability"".

Because of the early dinner and the reservation, we had no problems getting a table and were seated within a few minutes.  Walking into the restaurant, you notice immediately how clean and big the restaurant is.  The staff were very courteous and friendly.  I was definitely impressed.  

Now, on to the food, the 3 of us ordered a variety of items and shared amongst us.  By the way, there was a table of 8 family members next to us, they all ordered their own dish and did not share.  I can not imagine us doing this.  I would be tempted to taste and try every possible dish that I can.  Anyways, this is what we ordered: 

Appetizers:
a.  Tom Yum Coconut Soup w\/ Chicken.  Compared to a lot of Thai restaurants that I have been, this was on the scale of AVERAGE.  It was okay and nothing to brag about.  Would I order this again... probably not -- I would preferred to try something else.  It was good average... I give this a mid to low 3 stars.

b.  #14 - Nam Kao -- okay, we ordered this because of the reviews.  It is basically sliced ginger, mixed with some fried type of crouton\/rice\/bread (hard to pinpoint), green onions, red onions, papayas, and some other stuff.  I guess this is sort of a hit or miss.  You either like it or not.  Honestly, I was not a fan.  In fact, I thought this was the worst dish of the night.  I give this a mid 2 stars.

c.  Beef salad -- this was the star of our dinner.  By far and away the best dish of the night.  If I knew, I would have ordered 2-3 of these puppies.  The beef was cooked to perfection ~ medium rare.  And, it was seasoned to perfection.  The only issue that I had was that it was very spicy (for a #2 spice level).  I must have drained 3 large glasses of water.  But, this was well worth it.  My first 5 stars.

Entrees:
a.  Drunken Sea Bass w\/ Noodles -- okay, this dish was about 29.95.  It was a bit pricey; however, based on the review, we had to try it.  And, quite frankly, this was a very good dish.  The Sea Bass was soft, tender, and flaky.  And, the right mixture of sweetness and season was mixed in with the noodles. But, I did not think this should have been a $29.95 dish.  It is a bit steep.  For this, I grade it as a low 4-4.25 stars.

b.  Fried Prawns -- this was by far the most original dish.  They basically take these jumbo sized shrimp (think size 10-15) and peel the skin back.  Best way to explain this is to think of a horizontal line.  On one end of the shrimp is the shrimp meat and on the other is the peeled shell side.  They marinate the whole shebang in some salty sauce and deep fry it.  What you get is a fried shrimp with the shell attached.  You eat both the meat and the shell.  It was quite tasty.  However, I have to say that I wished they had a dip for this - something tangy would be a nice fit .. i.e. sweet and sour would do.  For originality and taste, I give them a high 4 stars or low 5 stars.

Desserts:
a.  Fried Banana -  If I had to do it again, I would not order this.  It was okay.... also, we were a bit too full to eat this -- doggy bag time.  2-3 stars.\

b.  Sweet Rice with Mangos -- this was not too original.  I was not into the rice; however, I have to admit that the mangos were very sweet.  I give this a mid 3-star rating for the mangos.

Overall, this was a pretty cool experience.  The service was excellent.  We had some dishes that were okay, but we also had some amazing and original dishes as well.  Dinner total for 3 (no drinks - except water) totaled to 106 dollars.  With tip, it added up to $125 in all.  3 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts -- hmm, not a bad price at all!  I would give this a solid 4 with room to move up to 5 star status...

BTW, as we walked out around 7pm, the whole restaurant was packed and the parking lot was filled with Lotus of Siam patrons.

We definitely would be back.  And, we look forward to trying other dishes.

Interior: A little dated, and the ceiling had those popcorn asbestos type things on it. BUT WHO CARES?! 

Service: The host was prompt, we had reservations so we were seated right away. Most of the tables were full and this was around 8pm on a Thursday. I can only imagine what the weekend is like. The server was attentive, and the bus service was prompt. It did take a little while for our bill to come after the meal, but who cares, we were stuffed and needed a minute to just sit around anyway. 

Food: MOUTHGASMIC. We ordered:
-Stuffed Chicken Wings 
-Tom Yum Kai (7 spiciness) 
-Yellow Curry Chicken (6 spiciness) 
-Mint and Green Chili Beef
-Sticky Rice 
-Thai Iced Tea

Everything was awesome. The Tom Yum Kai was spiced perfectly, it had the right amount of kick but still retained its sour lime flavor. I wish I had ordered the Yellow Curry in a 8, it was not spicy at all, but the coconut base was still good. This was the first time I had Sticky Rice and i really enjoyed the firm yet soft and sticky texture. I'll be ordering it often. The mint and chili beef was my favorite dish, it was a great mixture of flavors and spices that hits the mouth at all angles. Stuffed chicken wings?...c'mon, so bomb. How is it even possible to make!? It defies the laws of physics and gravity. LOL.  It was very tasty. The thai iced tea was perfect, not too sweet, and very refreshing. 

Overall, possibly the best Thai meal i've ever had. It did not break the bank either. We spent about $53 with tip. I'll definitely be coming back here to sample more fine Thai cuisine.",0,1,0

A few tips: 1) the entrance to the restaurant is from the back\/parking lot area, not the main street; 2) the drinks at the bar while you wait for your table, and yes, you will wait (we did even with a reservation) are not horribly priced.  No hard liquor; and 3) make a reservation.  We called on our way into Vegas for the next day, so don't be scared off by this fact.  Just call, take the late night reservation time, and enjoy the food. 

Started with fried wontons, which honestly were tasty but nothing new or interesting or astonishing.  Then, had the beef with peppercorn, which is a ton of little peppercorns on the vine (?) which surprised me; but this was delicious.  Never had something like this before!  Also, tasted the garlic prawns.  All the talk on yelp, so I'll leave that to the serious seafood eaters. 

Giant parking lot, so that's one less thing to worry about.  Also, lots of cabs hanging out in the case you want to take one over from the strip and just step outside to head back.",1,0,0

This was hands-down the BEST thai I have eaten, anywhere.

We also doubled up (and tripled) on some of the dishes. Holy crap - everything I ate exploded in my mouth with flavor. The Crispy Rice, Golden Tofu, and Crispy Duck Panang Curry really stood out in my opinion. This falls into the top three best meals I have ever eaten in my life.

Already the rare recipient of a Las Vegas Beard Award, Chef Saipin Chutima named Best Chef: Southwest in 2011, Lotus of Siam was recently nominated as a semi-finalist for Best Restaurant, a surprising recognition that occurred in the two-weeks between making a reservation for twelve and the actual 5:30pm Saturday that the group sat down for the meal.

Having visited the unassuming icon of Thai food that rose to national attention in the mid-2000s only once prior, a lunch reconnecting with a local restaurant General Manager and his girlfriend at Christmas 2012 seeing a limited number of plates amidst a dining room that was completely packed, arrival prior to opening over four years later saw a line for walk-ins of 30+ circumvented by a simple phone-call and credit card on-hold, the group seated promptly at a lengthy table with water soon poured and a Wine list offered.

Having performed due-diligence this time, the sizable menu navigated beforehand with a choice of ten different plates in orders of one or two, depending on portion, it was after a brief exchange with the server that a hand-written list was annotated to spice-level five with requests for a slow roll-out, the plan originally going smoothly but soon deteriorating into a flood of plates that saw several miss out on various dishes as they circulated the table.

More pricey than Thai anywhere else in town, though the ingredient quality is undeniably high, it was at a Hot Pot of Tom Kha Gai spewing fire that all gazed as it was presented near room's center, the smooth flavor of Coconut and boiled Chicken blending with Lemongrass and light heat an elegant way to start while the Northern dip of Green Chilies was little more than a tiny portion of Salsa crafted primarily from roasted Jalapenos, several Garlic Cloves and Sesame.

Watched over by photographss of famous folks who'd stopped in, everyone from Joe Montana to past-Presidents smiling and signed behind glass, plates of Sour Isaan Sausage and Nam Kao Tod trailed the Soup and Dip by approximately fifteen minutes, two orders of the former enough to offer a small slice of snappy Meat with a deep, yet pleasant, funkiness to everyone while the latter was a great suggestion from someone who's visited the restaurant frequently, slices of Cabbage and Peanuts served alongside a deep-fried Rice Ball studded with Pork amidst earthy aromatics and the unmistakable flavor of Fish Sauce.

At this point only 5:55pm, the restaurant completely full and two-deep at the bar with a line still snaking from the door, a flurry of servers soon saw the table packed with two plates of Drunken Noodles, a small mound of Spicy Rice plus filleted Catfish in Basil and Crispy Duck with Panang Curry, the fried rice no different than that at any Chinese restaurant on Spring Mountain Road and thus no more compelling than a steamer of the white stuff while the Pad Kee Mao was oily and not particularly flavorful beyond the Soy and Fish Sauce, an upcharge of $27.95 for Duck compared to the $12.95 Chicken really not justified as the flavor of each was drowned out.

Impressed by the meaty Catfish, though a whole-animal preparation would have been more price-appropriate than the small filets of a fish that is generally quite cheap, Duck in Panang Curry righted many of the faults found in the other dishes with great crispiness and rosy flesh amidst the robust sauce of Coconut, Peppers plus light notes of Sugar and Citrus that was so good that it commanded a second plate.

Rounding out the evening by 6:40, the staff vigorously working to turn the table, Northern dishes of Kang Hoh and Kang Ka Noon each furthered the rumor that LoS's best plates are found on the back page of the menu, the Dry Pork Curry a spicy little number with big fermented flavors while the crunchy rounds of Jack Fruit were not dissimilar from Artichokes in taste or texture amidst a vibrant, acidic Curry that was good on its own and even better when mellowed by the White Rice used to sop it up.

***  Exiting Lotus of Siam at $30\/each after Tax and 18% Gratuity, not accounting for those who chose to drink wine, it would be hard to say that anyone had eaten their fill while some actually reached out to say they did not even have a chance to sample several of the plates, a combination of rushed service and small portions paired with some truly average dishes leaving me in no rush to return before delving further into Las Vegas' less-famous Thai places.",11,3,7

Ambiance \/ Décor: Nothing great about the ambiance, standard run of the mill place. The location of the bar is a little strange, its right at the end of the dining area, so you see a lot of people moving around while waiting for the tables. 

Server: Our server was very attentive and friendly. He cracked a few jokes and kept the conversation lively. Also checked on us time to time.

Food: The food was good. We tried drunken noodles and green curry. I found that they used more basil compared to other places... I love basil in all forms, so had nothing to complain.

Was soooo excited to come here after hearing about this place for years! Thai restaurants are pretty standard in the Bay Area, so I was really hoping for something different. 

Reservations are a must for dinner (or anytime, probably)!! Or come right when they open at 5:30PM and get your name on the list. I came here on a Sunday night at 6PM and it was already a 30 to 45 minute wait for a table for two.

Definitely try to order items you don't normally see at other Thai restaurants. That's the key. If you go for the same old stuff that everywhere else has, then that's what you're gona get... the same 'ol boring stuff. Try something different!

Get the Nam Kao Tod! It's crispy puffy rice sauteed with sour sausage. It sounds a little weird, but it's delicious! I love the crispy texture and there's tons of tangy flavor from the sausage and citrus they put in it. Watch out for the heat though! It might not seem that spicy at first, but the spice creeps up on you and lingers!

The drunken noodles with soft shell crab was SO GOOD. The sauce for the noodles is on the sweeter side. It's a nice compliment to the salty, crunchy soft shell crab. Don't forget to eat some of the deep fried basil leaves with it!

But the most amaaazing thing was their mango and sticky rice! HANDS DOWN the BEST mango and sticky rice I've ever had! The mango was perfectly ripe and so sweet. The sticky rice was unique with the hint of floral in the background. And I couldn't get enough of their coconut milk!

This is also a great place for you wine lovers! Their wine ROOM is astonishing. They have a whole binder as their wine list. They even have one FULL page dedicated to German Rieslings alone!

Lotus of Siam is a very well respected Thai restaurant in Las Vegas (it recently won a James Beard award).  The restaurant is off The Strip but not too far away.  The restaurant is located in a deserted kind of strip mall and has a no frills decor, but it is nice enough.  The restaurant is clean and has warm colors (the walls are outfitted with many photos--I guess with pictures of celebrities though I did not take a close look).  The restaurant is also bigger than I expected and was very busy (luckily, we had reservations).

The menu at Lotus of Siam is huge.  There is an unbelievable number of dishes and they range from all kinds of proteins (beef, pork, shrimp, chicken, many kinds of fish) to many different types (soups, salads, noodles, appetizers, and so on).  We tried several things.  Here is the rundown.

(Deep fried chicken wings stuffed with ground pork and served with sweet and sour sauce).  The chicken wings were moist and flavorful as well as crispy (and not greasy).  The sauce was thin and mostly sweet.

(Tom Yum Kung hot and sour soup with shrimp, lime juice, lemongrass, and straw mushrooms) The soup had a strong citrus flavor as well as good fragrance from the fresh herbs.  There was a very generous portion of shrimp, which were plump and moist.  The soup was surprisingly spicy and left quite the tingling on the tongue.

(Thai Beef salad with onion, tomato, chili, lime juice, and greens) I liked this one more than my friends, who were surprised by its lack of salad-ness.  The salad was mostly a stir fry, but the meat was nicely cooked and had a good flavor.  I liked the lime flavor as well as the moistness of the plate.

(Charbroiled prawns with garlic black pepper sauce) The prawns were big, moist and tender.  The garlic black pepper sauce was good and not too overpowering.

(Pad Thai with chicken, egg, green onion, bean sprouts, and chopped peanut and Thai fried rice with shrimp, egg, onion, and tomato) Their Pad Thai and their fried rice were the only disappointing dishes of the night.  The noodles were too soft and clumped together too much.  The other ingredients were fine, but the overall flavor was nothing special compared to other Thai spots I've tried.  The same could be said for their fried rice.

(Crispy duck with chili, mint leaves and Thai basil) The duck was very good--moist but with a great crispy and crunchy outside batter.  The garnishes were flavorful and fragrant.

(Braised beef short rib panang with a red cream curry sauce and cognac) The creamy sauce was great--great flavor and incredible fragrance.  The short rib was just okay.  While mostly tender, the short rib varied from kind of dry in some parts to too fatty in other parts.

(Fried banana rolls) I liked the very egg roll-like wrapper (crispy, thin and not too sweet).  The banana was sweet and good.  I liked it, but it was nothing exceptional.

(Coconut ice cream) The ice cream had a good flavor and was creamy, but it was a little sorbet like.

Service was friendly, but it did take a while for us to put in our order.  The first dishes took a little bit of time to come out and I wished that our second run of dishes would have been spaced apart more (too much came out at the same time).

Prices were very good.  Given the quality and the fact that Lotus of Siam is in Vegas, the meal was easily the best bang-for-your-buck meal I've ever had in Vegas.

While I am not that experienced with Thai food, I really enjoyed Lotus of Siam.  Many of the dishes were good.  Since Las Vegas has so many overpriced restaurants, it was very refreshing to try a place like Lotus of Siam where you could spend less but not sacrifice in terms of quality.  If I was ever in Vegas again with a big group and needed a satisfying but also reasonably priced dinner, we would definitely head to Lotus of Siam.

The wontons and egg rolls were deliciously crisp and fresh. The sweet and sour sauce was to die for.

Then we moved on to dinner. The Beef Pad Thai was superb and the spicy fried rice with chicken was excellent. The presentation of everything was elegant and the taste was fantastic.

The wine menu in this place is stunning! I had an Auslese riesling that was sweet and delectable.

The larb salad, fried tofu, and yellow curry were all fantastic and some of the best I have ever had, and I have eaten those at many, many places over the course of the last 2 decades. Cashew chicken was pretty great too. 

The only thing that was just okay was the tom yum soup - definitely decent, but not the best ever. They got the sour part right, but I like mine super fragrant with lots of lemongrass and cilantro, which this did not have. 

I only wish we'd had room for dessert - we both felt very sad that we didn't have any space left to try it (if you check out what all we ordered above, you can see why, haha)!

I like spending my hour flight with you to Las Vegas. You were  so funny and there was so much to learn about in such a short amunt of time. I would like to thank you by telling me about Lotus of Siam. 

I have to say the location is kinda hidden. I had a hard time finding it with my GPS. It is in a stip mall that looks run down. I would never think that such a place would be so popular. 

I came here with Kim D.  I was so happy to see lemon grass drink on the menu. I have looked at all of the dinning places in the Bay Area and have not ever seen it on the Menu.

 I tried it once when I was on a trip to Thialand.  I remered to being sweeter with a fuller taste to it.  The one at Lotus of Saim brought me back to Thailand. It is not as sweet and taste as if there has been more water added to the drink. That being said it was still good.

We had also odered a soup it was sweet and sour with chicken and coconut. It was the best soup I have ever had. Notes of lemon and coconut rang out. A dance that came together. I wish I could bring it home. 

We had also odered the Pad Thai with shrimp and eggs whites only. the pad thai was only oki. 

the last dish was Larb with pork. It was only oki as well.",2,1,1

We decided to go out and stop by the convenience store to pick up items we needed and with a surprise we got texted within about 30 minutes. I am giving this place a 5 because food was very good and I have been Bangkok before and food is comparable to it. Just as good or even better than some places in Thailand. Service was also wonderful, you don't expect much service at Asian restaurants but this was an exception. Probably first Asian restaurant I have been too where they had a host\/hostess, bus boy, and waiter\/waitress. I would love to come back again just to try other items.

Food - 5\/5   Very delicious and comparable to Thai food in Thailand. We had the crispy duck with Panang. Duck was extra crispy and that curry sauce was to die for!!!

The pork fried rice was initially just okay -- but after doctoring it up, it was great.  They initiallly got my order wrong, but even on the second try it was lacking in flavor so I asked for some of the spice rub for the wings and I mixed it in along with some of the thai bird chili and fish sauce (from the chili cart you need to ask for).

After waiting around the bar with a couple of beers we were seated in the back room and left to peruse the lengthy menu.  We ordered a bunch of things, but here were my favorites:

Crispy Duck Khao Soi: Must get. The khao soi had great, full bodied-flavor and the crispy duck  was DELICIOUS. Seriously couldn't stop going for more, long after my jean buttons were begging for mercy. I honestly have nothing else to say except that you should definitely order it. 

Beef Penang: This is my staple Thai dish and I thought their version was good. Not mind-blowing, but I think I'm just biased because this is my favorite dish. My fellow diners thought it was absolutely delicious!

Cold Jackfruit Salad: I don't remember the actual name of this dish, but it was jackfruit with ground pork and lime juice (among other things) served cold with slices of raw garlic. Although this dish is admittedly a little funky (as jackfruit inherently is), once I got used to it, I kept going back. The raw garlic is a little intimidating at first, but it actually really complements the flavors of the jackfruit and almost tones them down a little. 

Tofu Pad See Eew: Another staple dish just done really well. You can choose how you'd like the tofu cooked and we went with deep fried, because Vegas baby! Even the carnivores at the table were raving about how good it was.

Easily may have been one of the best meals I've had period.  Definitely the best meal I've had in the last few years regardless of cuisine type.

I figured I'd go with the popular specialties:

Garlic Prawns:

Amazing, huge, while pricey, over $20, it was a really big portion.  They were huge prawns, perfectly fried, lots of garlic, stupid good!

Crispy Duck Penang:

The duck was amazing.  And I'm picky as hell on my duck.  It wasn't overcooked.  It had a very light batter that was super crispy.  Skin was perfectly crispy.  The penang sauce was wonderful.  I don't eat a lot of Thai food so I can't compare it to other places, but it was really good.  The only compliant on this one is that its a relatively small portion for the price, also over $20.

Shrimp Pad Thai:

I figured I had to try Pad Thai done proper.  Now I can't speak towards it's actual authenticity as I haven't had it in Thailand, but it was easily the best Pad Thai I've had.  The shrimp were also really large and perfectly cooked.  The portion was medium sized, but the price was only around $12 or so, so definitely worth the money.

Possibly because I had this thought in my head that Thai food can't be much different from the many places that we already tried back home in Hawaii...or maybe it was because my friend who introduced us to some of our favorite Thai food places back home didn't care for this place much.  I am so glad that we ended up here regardless of the reasons pointing elsewhere because I really really enjoyed it. Since they are 

LOCATED near the airport (South side of the strip). It was convenient and the timing was right. 

FOOD - GREAT - We always order the same food items when trying a new Thai restaurant for the first time. It's basically so I can compare the taste. It's also our favorite dishes. 

Egg Roll\/Spring Roll - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#30s9CUJHF-BaOe0FWkX9nQ I asked for Spring Roll and he said they call it egg roll here. This confused me as I always thought that Vietnamese and Thai call theirs spring rolls but he said they don't use the rice paper wrap. Didn't matter, I enjoyed it. Rice paper wrap, egg dough..whatever... it came out hot, it was crispy and had great filling. 

Pad Thai Noodle W\/Chicken - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#skkyJU6psgsiM0M_AqMO9g I was very impressed with this dish. The noodles did not stick together, it was not too oily, and it had a very rich and strong peanut flavor. It also had the right amount of acidity to balance out the richness. This was one of the better pad Thai dishes that I have eaten. 

Panang Curry W\/Beef - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#LhgLajbztEVV4jVr_ggEvQ We normally order panang curry or yellow curry but lately we been choosing panang more than yellow. Probably because panang is richer and creamier in flavor, and that is exactly what we got with this dish. They don't give a lot but you don't need a lot since this dish is packed with flavor.  

Spice levels are based on a scale of 1-10 and we got level 7. This is about as high as I would like it to go here. Any higher and it would have probably killed the taste for me. 

The ENVIRONMENT here was very pleasant. Although it was very crowded, we didn't feel claustrophobic because they have lots of tables and are properly spaced out. The size of this place is a pretty decent size. We were even able to bring in our stroller. 

The SERVICE is good. As soon as we entered our hostess took us to a table to accommodate our stroller. A huge plus in my book. Our server also had proper knowledge and took care of us in a timely manner. I just wish he would have been a little happier but I can't dock them just on that.

We arrived on time for out reservation and were seated and greeted promptly. *Be on time or they will give your table away if you're later than five min*. 

The wine list... Insane. Pages and pages of wine... Unbelievable. I definitely would recommend ordering a bottle, considering the price per glass. Once you taste the food, you will definitely understand why. 

The service was wonderful. We never ran out of water and there was someone constantly checking on us. I love that. 

The ambiance... Way way way too bright. I felt like I was in a hospital. The lights... Just too much. No table decor. No candles. Paper placemats. The decor was really dated. And considering their extensive wine list, I was expecting more umph. But it was okay. 

The food... Left so much to be desired. We had a jack fruit vegetable curry. It was more like overly spiced watery vegetable soup. We usually order a 7 or 8 in spice. We love heat. The 7 was almost un edible. Beware. The curry wasn't sweet at all... Just really really watery and hot. I'm not use to this style of Thai and obviously not a fan. The rice... It was good, but they gave one small bowl for the four of us. We order three meals. (Our friends were not impressed either). The price of the food is fitting for the ambiance. Will I return? Maybe for a birthday, but never on my own. We will stick to komol (same shopping center). They have the style of Thai I prefer apparently... And their food is just... It's so good.

If you do not like to venture out from your common traditional Thai dishes like Pad Thai, Pad see ew, this place is not for you.

We drove off the strip to check out this place. It's in a plaza next to some Korean Club\/Karaoke joint. I'm not going to lie but I definitely wanted to check out the Korean place out. Maybe some other time. 

We got a bottle of White Wine, The sticky rice appetizer, Crispy Duck in Panang Curry, Garlic Prawns, and Drunken noodle with crab. 

Honestly the food was phenomenal. The only issue I had was that I felt that the portions were small and pretty pricey for the amount of food you get and what it is.

Lotus of Siam has probably become one of the most famous Thai restaurants in the country, if not the most. Not too long ago, it was one of those hidden finds off the touristy Las Vegas Strip. Thanks to rave reviews from people across the country, as well as attention from the James Beard Foundation, the restaurant is squarely on everyone's radar.

GARLIC BLACK PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS - These were very crunchy and probably a bit overcooked. Surprisingly, I also found them rather bland. I'm curious if perhaps we received the wrong order, as there wasn't really any noticeable black pepper.

STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS - These wings were better, stuffed with some pork. Really meaty with a nice, light crunch to them. These weren't as moist as I thought they could've been though.

TOM KAH KAI (Bangkok Style) - I'm actually not at all familiar with this soup, but it was popular on Yelp. It didn't look like the most appetizing thing, but it was pretty good. There was a little bit of heat here, balanced by some lime juice and the coconut milk. Kind of reminiscent of a Chinese hot & sour soup. Kind of.

COMBINATION BEEF NOODLE SOUP - My mother was craving some soup noodles, however this was a little too spicy for her. It had a lingering spice that seemed to compound.  The broth had a lot of beefy depth, and I really liked the noodles here. Comforting.

SEA BASS DRUNKEN NOODLES - Wonderful dish. The sea bass was excellent. Lightly fried, the fish was moist and flavorful with just a little bit of crispiness. The noodles were very good as well, with some heat from the chili and a nice herbal sweetness from the basil.

I don't know a whole lot about Thai food so it's hard for me to really draw comparisons. I found this to be a pretty good meal, with the drunken noodles and sea bass to be a big highlight.",2,1,1

The Nam-Prik-Ong (Red Chili Dip) with vegetables and sticky rice is a great starter to any meal, and is the recommended dish by the great Ming Tsai.

However, once we stepped inside and were greeted by the friendly staff, we felt like we were transported to Thailand. 

The food lived up to all my expectations and all the hype.  Here are some we tried: drunken noodles, crispy rice, sea bass, a super spicy soup, garlic prawns.

I was really excited to try this place out after reading all the reviews and seeing it featured on the Food Network a dozen times but we came out a little disappointed.  There were some dishes that we liked but others were just eh ... 

It's located in some random strip mall that is pretty remote.  It's really the only place that looked open in the entire huge plaza.  There were some cars parked outside but as soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, I had no idea how big it was and how many people can fit inside this place.  After seeing all the people, I realized that all the cars parked outside were solely there to just eat at this location.  So of course, you start to get really excited. 

We made reservations for 8:30pm on a Friday night and we didn't have to wait at all unlike the walk-ins who had to wait about 45 min to an hour.

We ordered the following (ranked in order of like\/dislike):  

Tom Kha Gai Soup - this was by far the best tom kha gai soup that we've had.  They cook it based on a Bangkok style (not sure what that means) but it's freaking good.  We got the medium spicy level which was a bit too spicy for my husband (he usually eats average spicy) but I loved it (I can take red hot spicy) and I actually wished it was a bit more spicier for me.  You can order it by cup, bowl or pot which is nice.  We ordered a bowl for the two of us and it was a little too much.  We still had some leftover that I really wanted to finish but we wanted to save room for the other stuff. 

Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab - we were a little disappointed with this dish.  It has a lot of potential to be a great dish but when we got our noodles, they were stuck together in massive clumps and it came out mushy.  They didn't separate out the noodles and that part of the dish was just bad.  The flavoring was awesome and the soft shell crab on top was delicious.  I think it had to do with them being in a rush since the place was packed and I can tell they just wanted to serve you and get you out the door as soon as possible.  I would rather go back when it's not as busy and try this dish again to see if the noodles will actually be separated this time because this was a great dish but the noodles just fell flat for us. 

Deep Fried Garlic Prawns - this was another okay dish.  The prawns are deep fried so that you can also eat the shell.  The crunchy shells are amazing but we felt like there was something lacking from the flavor of the garlic prawns, almost like it needed a dipping sauce or something else.  We actually took them and dipped them in the drunken noodle sauce which made them taste better. 

Massaman Curry with Chicken - I kept reading about all the reviews for the curry so we had to order one to try.  The portion size of this curry was pretty small.  It was a very sweet curry and almost too sweet for my tastes which is odd because I love anything sweet.  The curry itself didn't have as thick of a texture as I'd like.  And there was nothing unique about this curry.  It tastes like curry that you can get from any other Thai place.  

Overall, we were slightly disappointed with the meal and we thought everything was okay not the greatest like everyone else points out in their reviews.  I would only go back if I had a reservation because I don't think it's worth the wait.  And I would only back to try this place out on an off hour when it's not so busy just so I can compare the drunken noodles.",2,0,0

The crispy duck was awesome with tons of flavors and an awesome sauce.  The garlic shrimp was unique as you can eat the entire shrimp (shell and all) since they fry the shell and it melts in your mouth when you eat it!

The only cons I would say was the service was spotty at times as it took 10-15mins to even get waiter to order.  But once we did get the waiter, we had pretty good service afterwards.

The portions are smaller than average but then again what they make up for portions, they gain in flavor and quality.

I would suggest ordering 2 dishes & appetizer or 3 dishes for a party of two.

It is a little more pricier than the average thai place but well worth it!",2,2,2

my favorite was the duck. we also got curry, which was supposed to be mild so my daughter could eat it, but it was still kind of spicy and i couldn't give her any. not a negative thing, i love spicy! just a bummer they couldn't really make it mild since my daughter lovessss curry.

A quick lookup on Yelp showed that it had a pretty good rating with 2000+ reviews so I decided to try it when I was in Vegas a couple of days ago. We tried calling them at around 7 pm to make a reservation but could not get through as their phone was constantly busy. We decided to take a chance and landed up at around 8:30 pm. To my surprise I found that Lotus of Siam was located next door to the now defunct Namaste Indian Cuisine a place that I had been too many times when it was open. Anyway even on a Monday evening they were completely packed and had a wait time of 45 minutes which stretched to almost an hour before we were seated. The restaurant is not very big but is a decent sized place that does not feel too cramped.

As there was only 30 minutes to closing we ordered a bunch of standard Thai dishes all at once like Crispy Fried Garlic prawns ($26.95), Pad se-ew ($9.95), Red Curry with shrimp ($13.95), Penang Curry with chicken (12.95), Combo fried rice ($11.95), Crab fried rice ($13.95) and Khoa Soi (10.95). Food was out in another 10 minutes so apart from the long wait to get a table service is pretty fast. I approached the food with a lot of skepticism as I've been burned too many times by these super hyped up places but after the first couple of bites it was clear that Lotus of Siam was legit and completely deserving of its high rating. The crispy fried garlic prawns were amazing, lightly battered, perfectly fried with a balanced taste that did not overpower the delicate crustacean. The pad se-ew was perfectly cooked noodles with just a mild sweet tang. Literally one of the best that I've had. The crab fried rice was another gem. Perfect taste without even a hint of the smell of crab. The Penang curry was also great. The noodles in the Khoa Soi were a little overcooked and hence were clumped together while the curry base was a little too watery so I thought that the dish did not come together very well. Taste-wise I thought that it had a good balance of sweet and spice, but most people in our group felt that it was too spicy for them. The red curry was not bad, just that it tasted very similar to the Penang curry. 

I felt that prices at Lotus of Siam were less than what you would pay at other similar Thai places but when compared with the inflated prices on the strip they seemed out-rightly cheap. Considering the overall package of service, cost and quality the only drawback that I can think about is the long wait to get a table. I'm almost tempted to deduct a star for just that, as it could seriously keep me from returning, but I'm going to overlook it and give them the rating that they deserve.",11,6,8

The portions of the food are all small and meant for sharing. I honestly do not remember much of what I ordered (but it was tons of food) but here's what stuck out to me:

Garlic Prawns- this dish is simply perfection. It's deep fried prawns!! It was so good and it was actually the last thing that came out to my table. Easily my favorite dish from the restaurant.

Crispy Duck Panang Curry: I normally don't like to eat duck but this dish was pretty good. The duck was perfectly fried and the Panang curry was perfectly seasoned.

It was so good that it put me in a four hour food coma that left me missing all the activities on my last night in Sin City -- no regrets.

I highly recommend reservations since the line was hopping before it was even open. We were lucky enough to snag a last minute reservation and got to skip the long line of hot and hungry patrons outside. The decor here is warm and homey -- like every family owned Thai restaurant you would fine in your favorite suburban strip mall in Anywhere, America. Lotus of Siam specializes in Isan food which is pretty similar to the Laotian\/Cambodian food I've had in the past meaning it was extra, extra delicious!

My best friend and I shared:
+ Garlic Prawns: The prawns are cut to look like the shell has molted off the flesh and then deep fried. Disgusting yes, but also very yummy and crunchy! As the menu said -- it's like potato chips! This hearty portion was on almost every table in the joint and for good reason too.
+ Panang Crispy Duck: Lotus of Siam does the deep fried game very well and this duck did not disappoint. I'm usually wary of duck curries because they can be very gamey but that was not the case at all -- this was recommended to us by our server since the bbq hen was not available and ended up being one of our favorite things on the menu!
+ Khao Soi - Burmese Egg Noodles in curry sauce. A unique dish that I have not seen on any other Thai menu near my house so we had to get this! It's super runny but totally worth the mess.
+ Nam Kao Tod: Crispy Rice Salad very similar to a Laotian dish I'm obsessed with. It was spicy and crunchy and full of different herbs and flavors! I recommend asking for extra lettuce to scoop this up since the cabbage they gave us was quite small and do not do the job right.

I would skip eggrolls or dumplings -- they are bland and not worth the space in your tummy.

My wife and I frequent Las Vegas and have had dozens of dinners at LOS, often bringing friends and relatives along.  Last Tuesday, unfortunately, was a letdown.  Something had changed since we were last there this winter.  We were a party of eight, very well behaved, and were ushered to the back room, no big deal.

What happened next was the ""Vegas Hustle"" by our waitress, who aggressively pushed high-ticket menu items on us.  This was something new, ordinarily, we have received very polite service here, however, you are in Vegas so we\/I just blew it off.

The food, the food , THAT is the problem, LOS's food has shrunk! I thought ""Are we giants?""  The Nam Prik Ong was the size of a thimble for God's sake!  The Papaya Salad was also incredibly tiny!  Even the prawns in the Garlic Prawns were smaller!

One of our relatives rant and raved about Lotus of Siam so we put it on our bucket list. It is hard to find because the restaurant is not facing the highway. During the day the shopping center almost looks deserted. There is a warning inside the restaurant about vehicle break-ins and not leaving luggage and valuables in plain sight. The first thing you notice when you enter the restaurant is all the articles about the Lotus of Siam. We were seated and waited on quickly. The wine list is amazing, they have one large glass enclosed area with racks of wine. There is another room that also is full of wine. Nine Wine Spectator awards are on the wall. 

My sister's Koong Teen, grilled shrimp with spicy sauce on top of sliced cabbage was tasty. The shrimp were tender and the sauce gave it a kick. I was leery of the raw cabbage but it had sort of a fish sauce that actually turned out to be like an Asian coleslaw. I ordered the Pad Thai and was asked if I wanted it spicy and I said yes. It turned out just right, it made you sweat a little. The garlic prawn and the crispy rice was very flavorful (according to my sister's boyfriend) and had been accompanied .by a very tasty Cucumber Salad. The Panang did have some thing I never had in a curry, grape tomatoes and red grapes. This restaurant is worth a visit if you like Thai food.

Prices are extremely reasonable, a great bargain and a great find in a town with no shortage of over-priced, over-hyped food and drink. When you consider all of the overpriced and overhyped restaurants in the casinos on the strip, this was one experience that we were glad we did not miss. I can't recommend it highly enough.",5,2,3

This place was on my bookmark list for forever now...and I made it a point with my friends that we had to check this place out.

My friends and I came here for an early dinner on a Thursday.We came and they said it would be a 45 minute wait and they would call my cell when a table opens up. So next time I will be sure to get reservations... thankfully the wait was less than that. My friends and I decided to do family style and get some different dishes to share. We got:

-Crispy duck with cognac sauce: i LOVE duck and this dish was amazing. It was my friends and mine's favorite dish. 
-Pad thai: Best pad thai Ive ever had. very flavorful and noodles cooked just right.
-Pineapple fried rice: Delish! very flavorful and good.
-Duck green curry: Yum I love thai curry and this was really good and flavorful.
-Beef with basil: Very good but was okay in comparison to the other dishes
-Mango and sticky rice with coconut ice cream: Thai food is not complete until you get this dish. The rice had a really pretty scent and slight taste of Jasmin. The mangos were perfectly riped. So good!

We had planned to have dinner at Pin-Kaow and originally planned  to meet at 6 PM, then delayed to 630, and finally 7ish was decided upon.  She called to let me know that she got a lot of work done and has a lot of free time.  We started talking about Pin Kaow and find out she she's been there.  I like her to have new experiences, so I asked if she would be interested in trying out Lotus of Siam.  An enthusiastic ""yes""...

It's been 5 years since I'd been here and called to see if reservations are needed.  I spoke with a guy named ""Bank"" who later I found out is the Manager.  He said they are booked and walk in's may need to wait 20 minutes.  I asked if they had a bar and he said that they do have a bar.  (that's new since I was last there)...I then asked if there was a ""walk in"" list.  He took my name and added my friend and we were good to go.  

Last time I was here a HUGE fight with around 15 people broke out in the parking lot.  The neighborhood is sketchy so have  your head on a swivel if you go.  When we arrived, there are what looks like patrons waiting outside for a table.  I was beginning to wonder how big the bar is.  We walk in and THEY EXPANDED!!!  They have a huge wine selection now!  Wow!  We announced our arrival and let them know we would be waiting in the Bar.  Everyone was very nice.  Zero, zip, nada attitude.  

We sat down, had ordered wine by that glass and were seated about 10 minutes later.  

I usually order the same foods regardless of which Thai establishment we go to so I asked Joe, our Waiter, for his recommendations.  We ordered the NAM KAO TOD Crispy rice appetizer that's mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice..  I'm big on hot dogs\/sausage, so Joe offered it made with Tofu.  Excellent decision.  For our main course we ordered a Northern Thai dish called Northern Laub, which apparently is ompletely different from the Issan larb in taste, this northern style larb (ground pork) is cooked with Northern Thai spices and no lime juice, garnished with fresh herbs and vegetables.  I think I would have preferred to have this made with Tofu too but didn't want to upset the Chef with too many changes.  However, I think it would ahve been cool if it did.  They are very accommodating.  I've almost been kicked out for making a suggestion at a SF Chinatown spot. Anyway, an finally, La Piste de resistance,  Khao Soi.  This typical Burmese influenced Northern Thai egg noodle is served in curry sauce and coconut cream (your choice of beef or chicken), garnished with sliced red onion, lime and pickled vegetables.  All of these dishes can be made with a spiciness range from 1-10.  We ordered a 7 for all and the smoke was perfect...I could have gone to an 8, but it was a perfect dish at 7.  Do NOT eat the little red peppers in the dish or have water ready.  Ice water.  Oh, we also ordered the Thai Tea.  Very refreshing.  They do not have coffee there.  Well, they do have instant, but is that really coffee, is it?

Oh man...the La Piste de resistance is really the sample platter dessert.  It's comprised of Coconut ice cream, Sticky rice with Mango's (if you like the salty sweet thing then this is your thing), and Fried banana rolls drizzled with honey.  Menu diva at it again...we were full so didn't want a Cheesecake Factory sized dessert.  Joe hooked up a sample Sampler for us.  The very sweet dessert maker delivered it for us and reaffirmed that it was made smaller for us.  It was sill plenty of food though.  ( I promised my friend I would not mention that she ate 75% of each plate, though she claims more of a 50 50 split.  Hey, I'm not mad at her. A gurl's gotta eat, right?)   

Our bill for the two of us was less than $50 and we got our grub and drink on big...well, at least she did...kidding of course...kind of...OKAY...I am kidding.  We both ate good.

When I first moved here in 2001, I discovered Lotus of Siam listening to NPR.  The were saying how Gourmet Magazine chooses the top 10 restaurants in LV every year and every year, Lotus of Siam is selected.  How can one resist right?  The food was not awe inspiring, but I would not kick it out of bed for eating crackers either.  The food was 3 stars, the Service was 5 stars so I took an average of the two...(3+5)\/2) is equal to 8\/2 which equals 4...just in case...

Alrighty then!!!

FOOD POISONING.

I went here on Friday night (1\/15\/10), my last night in Vegas after living here for 10 weeks for work. It was supposed to be legendary, and in some ways, I guess it was. 

I had the Panang curry with chicken. In all truth, it was quite delicious. Without the sickness that would follow the next 24 hours, this would be 4 stars. My stomach has only now recovered enough to allow me to write a review without feeling like I am going throw up again. 

I was with three other people, nobody else got sick. But this was all I had to eat that night, my previous meal was at Top of the World at Stratosphere for lunch, and was 7 hours before LOS, and my only drink of the night was the Thai beer I had with my meal, so I think it is safe to assume that the food here caused the illness. 

So there you go, food poisoning. Delicious food, but you might end up paying dearly for it later.",0,0,0

It didn't seem very authentic to me, nor was the food as good as people say. This is not the kind of Thai food I grew up eating, and my family is from Thailand and Laos. 

We got 6 dishes which we were to share amongst each other. Specifically: Chicken Kao Soi, the Crispy Duck in Chili Mint Leaves, Beef Pad See-ew, Spicy Chicken Wings, Papaya Salad, and Pork Larb. 

We started out with the Papaya Salad and Larb. Holy crap, were the portions tiny. I make papaya salad and also cucumber salad (same concept but with cucumber) every week, at home, in huge portions and it's a very inexpensive dish to make. There's no reason why it was served in such a small portion and at that price. It does come with sticky rice, but still, more would've been nice. Especially between 6 people. The Larb was tiny too. Each of us had a tbsp full on our plates. lol. It was cute, but also quite sad. Both dishes were gross to me, personally. Since when do you put sesame oil in either of those dishes? It must be a regional thing. I don't know. Either way, it was gross. I don't make it that way, nor do any of my family or friends whom are from Thailand and Laos. The Papaya salad had very unbalanced flavors too, which is Papaya salad blasphemy. It tasted sweet and spicy, but no salt or tartness. Weird. The Larb would have been ok if it wasn't drenched in sesame oil. I liked the spices, which were different, but good. 

The Entrees were also very tiny and mediocre. For a place with so much hype, I expected to be amazed. I wasn't. At least with most of the entrees. I didn't actually get to eat the duck or chicken wings, but I heard they were fantastic. My brother is a piggy, so he ate most of it. I pretty much sacrificed my food so everyone else could eat. Needless to say, I went to bed hungry that night. :(

As for the service, it was ok. Waiter didn't yell or throw stuff at us, so that was good. :P",0,2,0

When entering, awards from Gourmet magazine, best of las vegas, cabbies choice, newspaper articles align the walls. My expectations were raised a bit higher. Wow, did this place deliver. 

The menu is in a form of a book and it takes about 20 mins. to read through and make very important dining decisions. I would highly suggest dining with a large party so you're able try all of the restaurant specialties and the Chef's choice's.

It was just the two of us and we must of looked famished because we ordered half the menu. It was my last dinner in sin city and I wanted to win the gold medal of gluttonous overkill.

We ordered the crispy duck panang. Holy shit this is fcking awesome. The salt and pepper prawns with drunken noodles. Huge mutherfcking prawns, delicious. Spicy thai beef jerky, they need to bag this and sell it to cowboys. YUM. Fried chicken wings sauteed in garlic. Yes Yes Yes. A cold beef salad with lime, very refreshing. Crab fried rice and softshell crab curry. Why don't all thai places serve food like this? Chicken pad thai, this dish I didn't care for, I've had better. The quality of the food is by far better than any other thai place I've been to. The menu is very diverse, I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get away from the same standard fare that the casino's have to offer.

This time, I got the famous garlic shrimp, pineapple fried rice, shrimp panang curry and papaya salad.

You do have to make a reservation or go early when they open. They open for dinner at 5:30pm and we got to the restaurant around 5:15pm. There was already a long line ahead of us.

She hadn't yet been but said it was considered some of the best Thai food in the country. We arrived a bit early and ordered a Singha to share. They have an extensive wine list with many by the glass but we'd just come from Valley of Fire and were thirsty, so beer seemed to fit the bill.

It wasn't busy yet so we got a lot of time with our waiter and asked him what he recommended. The menu is pretty extensive and there are a lot of really interesting things to choose from, good descriptions too! He pointed out a few house specials and we ended up ordering entirely from his recommendations. We started off with the crispy rice and sausage appetizer. My boyfriend loved it. I thought it was spicy and salty but didn't taste like much.

Then, we ordered three dishes to share among three of us. Crispy duck with drunken noodles, short ribs in red curry, and the liver which the other two wanted to try. The crispy duck was by far the best of the three. Really delicious, good portion size too. The short ribs were amazing but there wasn't enough. I think there were four. For $20, I thought we'd get more than an appetizer size. But the sauce was really good over the rice. The liver tasted less like liver than I'm used to, the fresh lime and onion was really nice, but it was pretty dry and didn't come with any sauce. 

Overall, the ambiance of the place is okay. Not anything memorable and the lighting is bright and unremarkable. We liked the food but it's pretty rich and we felt a little ill later in the evening. It was pretty expensive too! I enjoyed it but don't feel a need to come back.

I'm still trying to figure out how this place has over 700 reviews on Yelp and is so highly rated given that there is a lot of really good food in Las Vegas. It seems to have a very good PR person! I think it's unique and worth a visit but we had an incredible meal at a gorgeous Thai restaurant right off the strip  for much cheaper on a different night.",3,0,0

Maybe not the best deal in Vegas but certainly one of the best things in Vegas. We make sure to come here at the end of our trip and it never fails to be a good end to any Vegas weekend.

We arrived during dinner rush, but honestly they're probably busy at any hour since it's been featured on Food Network, among other places. It is handy that they had iPads set up to where they can text you when they're ready to seat your party. There is also a bar area and a waiting room so you don't have to wait outside. Before dinner, we grabbed beers and Thai tea to drink in the waiting room while being able to sit and relax inside. They have photos of celebrities from movie stars to Food Network shows all over their walls, and the owner of the restaurant which was also the chef, popularly walked around to tables with which seemed to be many regulars praising him and greeting him. Our table was ready and we ordered the prawns which seemed to be most popular on all of the tables, and a duck noodle. Mind you, I'm not a fan of duck but it was crisp and fried to perfection in the most perfect sauce. The prawns were huge and flavorful. We also had a steak dish that came with a small sauce that is to die for. What had me was that they offer the Laos papaya salad that not many other places do. We ordered a spice level of 10 and we were dying but it was literally perfection. Everything was extremely good. I was disappointed to find out that they were out of mango sticky rice, so we settled for a fried banana and ice cream, which tasted similar to Filipino banana lumpia, but they were cut up into small pieces for an easier family style and small portioning.

2. Food: This is why this place gets 5 stars. This is Thai food that you won't find anywhere else. The Northern Thai specialties lend themselves to some dishes that will take you for a ride. Be adventurous. In my experience asking the waitstaff will lead them to just recommend you the regular ""safe"" stuff, so just pick one yourself. 

3. Drink: A thai place with a better wine selection than an upscale Italian restaurant? Sure, why not? 

4. Service. Havent been too impressed here - but to their credit they are ALWAYS packed and have to deal with tourists all night (this place may once have been a ""hidden"" gem, but it has most decidedly been found by the tourist crowd now)

It is my benchmark for all Thai places that I visit... This restaurant is a MUST try if you live in, or visit Las Vegas.

Let's go through my recommendations:

1. Tom Yum Kai soup (5\/5): The hot pot size feeds 5-6 and it's only $11.95. It's not overwhelmingly spicy, but it has a good kick. The lemon grass and straw mushrooms make the soup taste amazing!

2. Crispy Duck with Panang  (5\/5): I would actually rate this a 6 on a 5-point scale. This is my FAVORITE DISH at Lotus. The duck is so crispy with the curry on top of it. This dish is literally to die for.

3. Garlic Prawns (5\/5): This is on the Chefs Choice menu - these are deep fried prawns with the shells on them and they are sautéed with garlic and pepper. Don't peel the shells! This is one of the most amazing dishes they have! Even though it's $21.95, it's very much worth the price. Get it!

4. Khai Soi Braised Short Rib (5\/5): This is also on the Chefs Choice menu - another one of my personal favorites. The braised short rib is so tender; you can cut it easily with a fork. It's served over thai egg noodle in curry sauce, served with sliced red onions, lime, and pickled vegetables. This dish is a little pricey too at $20.95, but worth every penny.

5. Panang Curry with Chicken (4\/5): The panang curry is really good here too. We rode it with chicken. It's only $11.95 for this dish, and it's a great traditional Thai dish to get with your meal.

6. Drunken Noodle Seafood (4\/5): The drunken noodle seafood is one of their top recommendations. These are pan fried flat rice noodles served with an assortment of different seafood (mussels, calamari rings, shrimp, etc.). It is only $12.95, but I must warn that this is a little bit on the spicy side, i.e. more than we expected.

7. Pineapple Fried Rice (4\/5): We ordered this to share with a larger group, and it was surprisingly really good. I normally don't order fried rice when I go to a Thai restaurant because I can make it at home, but this was really good. Only $9.95 too for a good-sized order of fried rice.

You can't go wrong with any of the options I've listed above. Of course, if there are just two of you going, you aren't going to order all 7 of the dishes (unless you are really hungry), but the top recommendations I have are the Crispy Duck Panang, the Garlic Prawns, and the Khai Soi Braised Short Rib. Not a whole lot of veggies in those options, but ehhhh, these are the best ones. Can't wait to get back to Vegas so I can pay a visit to Lotus of Siam again. The restaurant itself is not in the best of neighborhoods, and from the outside, it looks like it could be a really crappy place, but do not be fooled. Go inside and taste the amazing savory dishes that I miss so dearly. Ok seriously, go there NOW!",7,2,2

Food:
1) Crab Fried Rice: As mentioned by other reviewers, I have no preference for it. It was good, but nothing extraordinary. In fact, the rice is a bit mushy and salty. I would pass on this.

2) Crispy Roasted Duck Panang: After seeing 2873838 reviews about it, I was intrigued to try it. This is my first time choosing duck as a protein to pair up with curry. I got level 2 (""mild"") spicy. This was also okay. The sauce was good, but I didn't care for the duck. Doesn't top pek King duck for sure.

3) Garlic Prawns: As expensive as it is ($27), it was pretty darn good. Please note, you'll get some empty shells but still tasty. Would reorder.

4) Chicken Satay (appetizer): Holy f*ck. This was DA BOMB . The peanut sauce.... Where do I even begin. It was the BEST, I mean, HANDS DOWN, FEETS DOWN, best sauce evaaaaaaa. I HIGHLY recommend to order.

We went last week for the lunch buffet -- what a tremendous disappointment! Their website says the buffet is served until 2:30, but when we arrived at 1:45, we noticed a sign in the window (dated 2003!) saying lunch ends at 2. The buffet was totally picked over, they didn't restock any of the interesting items, half of the trays were full of either non-thai food (tempura? egg-drop soup?) or filler (shrimp chips, fried wonton skins). One curry, one stir fry, one thai soup... and all of it lukewarm. The only salad was iceberg and miso dressing. Nobody every asked us if we wanted drinks, we had to beg for water refills. Avoid the lunch buffet at all costs.

Original (four star) Review 11\/06:
All the reviews below that call this place ""the best Thai restaurant in the country"" are, frankly, doing this place a disservice. It's a creditable Thai restaurant, and they certainly serve some of the best Thai food I've had since San Francisco's Thep Phanom took its nosedive into mediocrity. Every dish we tried was tasty and properly balanced, the service was attentive and welcoming, and the menu's impressive in its diversity. And, of course, there's an undeniable pleasure of finding such a gem amid the underbelly of Old Vegas seediness.

But unless you've spent your life eating ketchup-y pad thai, Lotus of Siam is not going to change the way you think about Thai food. But that's not the point, nor should it be. If you go expecting a palate-altering experience at a trek-worthy temple of gastronomy, you'll certainly come away disappointed. Go, instead, hungry for a well-made, casual dinner in an atmosphere that couldn't be less ""Vegas"" if it tried.",3,0,1

The buffet was small, but everything on it tasted homemade and delicious. We eat at a lot of buffets, and normally the small ones end up being a waste. This was not! The service was a little slow, and it wasn't very crowded, so both of those things surprised us. The curry chicken they had on the buffet made up for most of it, and the most interesting and unique tasting hot and sour soup we have ever had. Each spoonful had a different and complex flavor. We tried to figure out what all was in it that wasn't obvious, but couldn't. We would like to come back and try ordering off the menu for dinner.",0,0,0

It's certainly unfair for me to rate a restaurant that has been called ""The Best Thai Restaurant in the Nation"" when I've only eaten at four Thai restaurants in my life. 

But it was an interesting experience.

I'm not a connoisseur of Thai food but their dishes were very spicy. Duh, right?

Nam Kao Tod - I never had deep fried that wasn't burned, but they had it. It was the most memorable dish that we had out of the five we ordered. 

Sea Bass Drunken Noodles - quite good

Reminder: Their version of spicy is not the same as yours. Be careful when ordering.

The reason I'm rating them with 3 stars instead of 4 is because the food (while good) wasn't memorable enough for us. The service was also laid back, especially when we weren't knowledgeable with the food. If you need someone to refill your water (AND YOU WILL), you will have stand up and wave them down in order to get their attention.

I can't say that the GF and I will be back, but it probably was the best Thai I've had. It's too bad we really couldn't tell that it was.",0,0,0

I guess it's hard to live up to the ""BEST THAI RESTAURANT IN NORTH AMERICA"" billing. That creates some pretty unrealistic expectations. 

Still ... 

The place has a great vibe -- kinda like eating in someone's home. I would suggest that, unlike us, try going when they are not in the middle of their lunch buffet. Even though we ordered off the menu, I think the kitchen struggled to get out of their all-you-can-eat mindset. 

The BEEF JERKY ISSAN STYLE (#13A) was an adventure. Nice as a diner to try something this unfamiliar. Had really interesting flavors but before the beef was jerked the silver skin (tough and bitter) was not trimmed properly (or at all) and some of the bites were chewy in an unpleasant way. 

The NAM KAO TOD (#14 Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage) was really amazing. If you like that essential Thai taste of lime, powdered-toasted rice and fish sauce, make a point of trying this dish -- it was very good. The only criticism is when they say minced, they're serious. The sour sausage (which looked suspiciously like tiny cubes of chopped up ham steak) was hard to pick out (tastewise) from the other flavors. We ordered it medium and it was plenty spicy (we had two small children with us). This is a dish that I suspect gets better when you dial up the heat -- but even at medium was outstanding. 

I ordered the KANG HUNG LAY (pork stew northern curry, #K from the NORTHERN menu) and it was good. This is a ""dry"" style curry so if you're looking for lots of gravy to sop up with your rice go another direction. Some of the chunks of pork were fatty and some were a bit parched. I am a sucker for anything braised (I like the mouth feel) but without much liquid everything seemed a little dry. Still, overall, the dish had, as other reviews have mentioned, a nice homey feel. 

THAI LIME DRINK was a nice touch on a hot LAS VEGAS afternoon. 

However, the YELLOW CURRY (#129 with chicken) was really disappointing. My wife ordered it to share with the kids since it's one of their THAI favorites. In all fairness WYATT, my three-year old, ate more than his share and seemed to enjoy it -- then again he insisted on a McDONALD's happy meal on the drive over from SAN DIEGO. The chicken was grainy. The carrots were really al dente, the potatoes were nearly raw (literally not figuratively) and the yellow-curry and coconut cream base were thin and sadly bland. I think if it sat on a steam table for an hour or two the vegetables would have cooked through and the curry itself would have reduced down and concentrated the flavor. 

The single best THAI restaurant in North America ??? I don't think so but still, for the most part, pretty good.",4,1,2

I'll start with 2 things... this restaurant had been built-up to be amazing. ""Best Thai food west of the Mississippi,"" they said. Maybe I built it up so much in my head that the only place it could go was 'as good' and more likely to be 'not as good' as expected. Also, this review is purely based on customer service, as I didn't even get to the food. More on that in a sec...

Strike 1:
I arrived at 1:30p knowing they close at 2:30p. Walking in they seemed busy, but not crazy busy - there was no one else waiting for a table and plenty of open tables. Seeing the 'Please Wait to be Seated' sign, I waited. And waited. And waited. 5 minutes I waited, and nothing. No one. So I gave up on that mission and went to the bar (a counter in one of the main dining rooms) with 2 people eating lunch at it already. There was a guy behind the bar who paused his phone conversation long enough for me to ask him for a food menu, which he gave me.

Strike 2:
As a vegetarian, Thai restaurants are one of the few places I can generally count on to find a reasonable assortment of food that I can eat. That being said, being vegetarian is my thing and I don't \/expect\/ any restaurant to have vegetarian food.  Don't have it? Cool. I'll go somewhere else; no hard feelings. The menu didn't show any signs of offering tofu as a protein. Not a deal breaker for everyone, but it is for me.

Strike 3:
Back to those other guys at the bar, both eating their lunch when I was handed a menu. So the guy comes over to ask me if I'm waiting for a table, or... No, I'd like to have lunch right here. ""We don't serve lunch at the bar."" I look over at the other 2 people, and he says ""they're special.""

OK - thanks very much. See ya. He tries to stop me from leaving, but no. Strike 3 - you're out.

In Fall 2011, Mr R and I set out to try all three.  We lovingly referred to it as our Thai Trifecta, or Thai-fecta, if you will. 

We completed the Thai-fecta in December by visiting Lotus of Siam. 

The place is huge but cleaner and nicer than its strip mall implies. We arrived on a Saturday night at about 8:45 and we were seated after a 5 minute wait.

We had already studied the menu and knew what we'd order:

Nam Kao Tod - it was exactly as I imagined, but still not my favorite dish.  The lime in some Thai foods is not my favorite and this was a spicy, crunchy rice (not like fried rice, but more like a rice krispie) with sour sausage, onions, spice...and lots of lime.  It was pretty spicy so I ate it with cucumbers.

Spicy Drunken Noodles with Prawns - I love drunken noodles and these were pretty good. The prawns were huge and meaty - they still had the shells and little baby legs on them.  I confirmed a few times, ""we eat the shell, right?"" and they said yes. So I did. I could manage the shell but the legs freaked me out a bit.

Nam Prick Ong - Mr R loved this and I liked it a lot. Its spicy ground pork with red chiles that you scoop onto vegetables, pork rinds, or sticky rice.  We ordered the sticky rice just to keep our options open, but I really enjoyed it with the carrots and pork rinds. The rice made it more filling and wasn't necessary.  

Overall, Lotus of Siam was good and we'd come back.

I was able to indulge in the following gastronomic pleasures (in order of favorite to least fave, but they were all pretty dang good)--roasted duck with some kind of red curry, garlic prawns, Chilean sea bass (steamed) with ginger, tom yum kkoong and the drunken noodles. 

The roasted duck had a crispy skin and the curry was awesome!! Would def recommend this. Garlic prawns were also amazing. It's cut in half, with the meat curling out, but you can eat the rest of it as well (the shell). Deep fried, so it tastes like some kind of shrimp crackers. Dry (no sauce) but the flavor is bomb.

The ginger Chilean sea bass was cooked really well, but the sauce was a little lacking. Nothing special :\/ The tom yum soup can get pretty spicy, so if you can't handle spicy too well, I wouldn't recommend more than a 5\/10 haha. 

Service was also not too bad considering they seemed a little understaffed when I was there. Side note.. workers in white clothes aren't waiters, they just help with cleaning and serving.

The Golden Tofu was generic, tasteless, watery fried tofu that I could have had done better, at any other Thai place, for $4.

I ordered the Larb Koong extra spicy, 9 out of 10, but there was no ""extra"" spiciness at all, as far as I could tell. Either they don't read the notes from online orders or they don't care. I also paid two dollars extra for a large size, and got a side-salad sized order that I ate in about a half-dozen bites. It was tasty, and if I had paid six dollars for it, instead of 15, I would be pretty happy.

EDIT: I looked at the receipt given to me by the driver; the restaurant gave me a small Larb Koong after Doordash charged me for a large. So that reinforces my guess that they're not reading the online orders closely.

The Kang Omm had good flavor, but the chicken was anemic; there were three, small pieces of chicken in this dish, and it came with approximately a quarter cup of rice. But the wee little box of rice was cute, like a novelty-sized takeout container, and that was nice.

Me and a friend decided to look for a Thai place in Vegas after a weekend of camping\/climbing at Red Rocks. This was the closest place to pop up on our way back to Arizona so we decided to stop by and give it a whirl.

This place is by FAR the best Thai food that I have had in America so far. But that might not really be saying much as the rest of the places have been in Arizona. But there is no place in AZ that serve Isaan food and mm mm mmmm I have missed me some Isaan food. Seeing as how both of us have not had Isaan food since we were last in Thailand, we decided to splurge a little and ended up with a $90 bill between the two of us. I'm going to just reiterate that every single dish we ordered was the best that we've had in the states.

We started out with some Moo Dad Deaw (Issan Style Pork Jerky) This was one of my favorite dishes in Thailand and I was just beyond ecstatic when I finally found in a restaurant here. Som Tum (papaya salad) with some sticky rice to dip it in was next. It was funny to us when the waitress came by and was like ""Oh you eat just like Thai style!"" Tip. Try it. Soaking up the Som Tum juice with the sticky rice is oh so delicious. Again I find it hard to find a place that serves a good Som Tum AND have the sticky rice available so I was extremely excited. We also ordered the Tom Yum Kai soup to start out with too and it absolutely hit the spot. 

Then we finally reached our main courses. We decided on getting the Khao Soi and the Northern Larb. These are both Isaan (Northern region) style food that we have found impossible to find in Arizona. I'm not going to lie, the larb absolutely kicked my ass. But it usually does everywhere I have it. The dish was amazing yet I have forgotten how hot Isaan spicy really is. The Khao Soi is a noodle curry dish that is absolutely divine. I don't think that you really find this combination too much so I was glad to finally have it again.

I can't wait to come back already to get some of the other dishes that I have been searching to no avail for. People might go to Vegas for gambling but I am coming back for the Thai food. It might not save me any money but it will absolutely be worth it.

The only weird part of the experience might have been the fact that there was a empty table next to us the entire time. The place was hopping, the waiting parties at the bar were getting to be ridiculous, yet there was a table for four right next to us that was left empty. Now we had a couple theories for this. A. It might have been because we smelled. Everybody was in their Night out getups and here we were in shorts and a tshirt covered with a couple layers of dirt. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a certain odor permeating around us. B. We had spicy food. This entails me sweating like a pig. A + B probably meant nobody wanted to be within a 10 ft radius of me. I will try to clean up for next time...",1,2,2

The thai fried rice was not only small, but also generic. The saving grace was the nam prik ong. Other than that, most of the menu items can be found at sanamluang in Hollywood, California (thai town). Sanamluang not only tastes better than Lotus of Siam, but also costs less and offers more portions. To be frank, I was tempted in giving this place a 2 star review. The nam prik ong was delicious, but wasn't worth the ten bucks I paid for it. The small serving of nam prik ong showed me that this place was nothing but a scam on people who can't get good thai food in Las Vegas. Alas, the nam prik ong did taste good, so I must give this place one star above two. Overall, I regret spending $20 something dollars here.",2,0,0

- Well let's start with the food itself. The food is phenomenon. I have eaten Thai food in so many places and food at LoS is so much better in term of taste,  flavors, spices, and quality. When I slurped the soup, I could tell the sweetness and flavor came from bones\/meat  being stewed for hours, and NOT from loads of MSG many other places threw in to mask the sweetness. They seasoned the food so nicely that your tongue can taste the sourness, sweetness, spiciness and all other flavors at the same time without one overtaking others. The quality is always so fresh.  Food cooked here are truly being made with care and fitted for royalty. 

- This restaurant used to be hole in the wall kind of restaurant but since expanded out and lookw much nicer inside. This restaurant is also located in a kinda shading commercial center that you normally would not visit if you're familiar with that area. But guess what?  This restaurant is packed every night and you wouldn't believe how many people took taxi and limousines all the way from the strip to dine at this place. There is usually a line waiting outside even before the restaurant is opened for dinner. If you plan to come late, I recommend getting a reservation ahead of time.

- The chef, Saipin Chutima, has won so many awards and is considered one of the best chefs in the country. The restaurant is Zagat rated and so many celebrities and famous chefs dined at this place.

In term of price, I think they are very reasonable for the quality of food you get here. At least here, you truly get what you pay for, unlike some other crappy places in the strip that charge you an arm and a leg for crappy food. 

Don't believe me? Go try their dinner menu and you can see\/taste for yourself.",3,0,2

I like it.  Nice curry.  Tom Yung is good.  The wine list is relative to the cuisine and good.  But it is what it is.  A casual, fair-priced Thai bistro. 

I hear tourists caught up in the myth of Zagat saying it is the best restaurant in Vegas.  That's just plain foolhardy.  If this place was open late night it would be better but Chinatown is no further and the selections are better.

I was really looking forward to this place and had high expectations especially when Mr. Gold says this is the ""Best Thai food in North America."" We came on a Friday around 6:30 and were seated right away without reservations. I was really happy because the last time I tried coming here the place was packed.

After reading some of the review highlights here's what we ordered:

Tom Yum Kai (with coconut milk) - very simple soup with basil, mushrooms and chicken, but the soup was delicious. I can taste the lemongrass and coconut milk and it was just a little spicy.

Nam Kao Tod (Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice) - Very interesting dish, I think it was a little to sour for me and not just from the sausage but it was nice to try something I've never had before.

Beef sautéed in a garlic cilantro pepper sauce, served on bed of green - beef slices were tender and I loved the sauce, this was my favorite dish but I wish they put more beef in it.

Khao Soi (Burmese influence on Northern Thai egg noodle  with beef in a curry sauce and coconut cream) - I love Northern Thai food (Spicy BBQ in LA) and was happy to see a Northern Thai section. The beef was very juicy, a different cut from the garlic beef. This dish was a little more spicy but I loved it. After eating all the noodles we added the rice to mix with the curry sauce. Don't forget to use the limes, it made the dish better. This dish was my 2nd favorite.

Drunken Noodle Seafood - this was ok, they did put in a lot of seafood but it wasn't mind blowing.

Dessert: A sample of Mango Sticky Rice, Fried Banana, and Coconut Ice Cream - I think this was the best sticky rice I've had! The coconut ice cream was very refreshing with small chunks of coconut. The fried bananas were good too, not too sweet.

Including 2 beers and 2 Thai ice teas, tax and tip the bill was slightly over $100, I thought that was pretty pricey for Thai food. Especially when some of the dishes had smaller portions. However service was good and they were very friendly to us. I probably wouldn't have ordered the Drunken Noodles and tried another Northern Thai dish.

As a spicy food obsessive, this crying jag is a great memory, nothing negative of the sort.  My red-faced, drippy-nosed self was finally brave enough to get the wonderful server's attention, who removed the salad, and replaced it with a milder, uber-flavorful version...without us even requesting it and with no charge.  After ordering so-called ""Thai Hot"" for years from Thai restaurants in Indiana, I realized how much more authentically hot Thai food should be, thanks to Lotus.

We had walked from the Strip, underestimating the trek and how the surroundings were a bit creepy at night.  After going back and forth on flagging a cab, we finally made it to the strip mall and Lotus, and were able to be seated right away for dinner without a reservation.

Besides the burning hot Thai papaya salad, we split a delicious (cooling) bottle of Riesling. My dining partner ordered the whole catfish with sweet and sour sauce, and loved it. I had the red curry with tofu, with fresh basil and bamboo.  If you love Thai food, Lotus of Siam should be on your foodie wish list; escape the Strip and seek this place out.

1) Crispy duck Penang curry (pricey at $24\/dish) the skin is so crispy and the duck is cooked to perfection. I personally think the curry is too creamy but for those that love a coconut base curry, this is a must for you! 
2) Garlic prawns - gahhh damn it's good. They peel the skin but keep it semi attached to the meat of the shrimp so that you get the crunch of both. 
3) Veggie tom yum soup - the perfect combo of spicy and sour.

It's located slightly off the strip so very convenient to get to however the strip mall is old and ghetto.  When we came at 5p it looked dark and abandoned however by 5:30p when they open for dinner there was a huge line waiting to get in.

Service:
Good and FAST, we got our food a few minutes after ordering it surprisingly.

Food:
Nam kao tod - The first bite of this salad was amazing.  The crispy rice is crispy and is packed with flavor.  However by the second and third bite, it was way too salty.  Would not order this again

Tom Yum soup- Salty but standard

Crispy duck and drunken noodles- The duck was very crispy and good.  However the duck to noodle ratio seemed off.  There was like 80% duck and 20% noodles which I guess most people would feel is worth it but I like having more noodles.  After a few bites we were out of noodles and were just eating duck alone

When we complained to the manager he stated that they offset meals by 10 to 20 mins, but I fought back and told him that we ordered everything at one time, so there should be no reason why things are late. He apologized and said he would take care of us and would do everything he can to make us happy. I thought that maybe this meant a discount on the bill.

When the bill came it was full priced and no discount applied to anything. When I asked to see the manager one more time took about 20 mins for him to walk over to us and I had to remind the waiter multiple times to talk with manager, perhaps the worst customer service experience of my life. When he walked over I showed him the bill and asked what have you done to accommodate our hardships. He said ""oh yeah..."" and walked away. He then returned with some ice cream desert, but both me and my party were full and did not want dessert so he basically brought out something that was a complete waste, he should have just discounted the bill with the price of the ice cream. 

So in the end I walked in at 7:50PM left the restaurant at 10:30PM very upset at how the manager had handled the situation. I will not be returning to this restaurant and will warn people of the service here. I don't care how famous the place is or how good the food is, the management is destroying the hard work the cooks and everyone else puts forth. 

My previous experience was just the same, but they actually forgot to bring me an entrée I ordered, that was 2 years ago. I am sad to see that things have not changed much :(",2,0,0

- This place needs to be in downtown! Deceiving!

1. Our 45-60 minute wait lasted about 80 minutes. We had enough time to go back to our room, change, come back to the restaurant, and still wait long enough to be pretty hungry by the time we were seated. 

2. I got food poisoning. While we shared all of our dishes, one of them had individual soft shell crabs, which was the majority of what I puked out later in the evening. I've since read about other food poisoning reports here, particularly connected to seafood, so I think there must be a problem. It left me sick for a full 24 hours, and worse, my immune system was so down from the dehydration and the dry winter weather in Vegas, this was followed by a cold that lasted several more days. 

As terrible as my illness was, I had a very tasty dinner before the aftermath, which makes it hard to write Lotus off completely:

Despite walking in on a Friday night without a reservation we were able to get a table with a relatively short wait of about 15 minutes. I absolutely love the wait system, Waitlist Me, that the restaurant employs. After giving my name and phone number, I received a text indicating my estimated wait time and a link to a website showing my spot in the wait queue. Granted, the wait time estimate was somewhat off as it was 45 minutes initially, but seeing your place in the wait queue gives you a good idea of the remaining wait. Moreover, when our table was ready I received a text with the option to confirm or request an extra 15 minutes (presumably if you decide to go elsewhere during a long estimated wait).

My girlfriend and I decided to grab some drinks at the bar while waiting. I was surprised that the place had such an extensive list of wines available (in addition to their also extensive sake selection). They seemed to specialize in German rieslings, so I ordered a glass. I was not disappointed.

We found the staff to be very friendly and attentive. They were constantly floating around and checking in to know if we needed anything. And luckily, as we were pressed for time to get to a concert, the food preparation was quick.

Based on a tip from the show, we stuck to the northern Thai specialties. We ordered three items: Khao Soi, Sai Oua, and Thum Ka Noon. The Khao Soi and Thum Ka Noon were the agreed upon favorites. They were both just oh so flavorful. My personal favorite was the Thum Ka Noon, but my girlfriend preferred the Khao Soi. The Sai Oua was also very tasty, but, possibly because it was somewhat spicy, didn't leave the same impression as the other dishes. I'm not really a fan of spicy dishes, but if you are, then I'd recommend it as well.",2,0,1

You know it's legit when your cabbie perks up immediately when you mention that you want to be taken there from your hotel on the Strip. During my most recent trip to Las Vegas a couple weeks ago, I boarded a cab from the Palazzo and indicated to the cab driver to take me to the Lotus of Siam. He simply said in his Yugoslavian accent: ""best Thai food in Las Vegas...hell, best Thai food in the country! I love that place."" It seemed like an honest review, but not Yelp Elite caliber. 

So here goes mine, hopefully a bit more fleshed out:

Lotus lets people in around 5:30pm for dinner service. Knowing this, if you arrive a little before this time, you will see a group of people standing outside, all wanting to be the first one in. There's no order to the way people congregate outside, but there's an unspoken rule to just keep a mental tab as to who arrives after you, and when the doors swing open, to make it inside the restaurant before them. The sooner you sit, the sooner you eat! No pushing or shoving, though the temptation to invade others' personal space is strong as you try to think of what to order in advance in your head.

As you shuffle inside, you'll be greeted by newspaper snipets featuring Lotus in the local papers. You'll see plenty of photos of famous people (both American and presumably Thai) over the years, enjoying the food at this Las Vegas institution.

According to others in my group, the restaurant was expanded relatively recently to include the empty neighboring space. That effectively allowed the owners to add a wine bar and a wine storage room, as well as more dining space. It doesn't seem like there's much activity going on at the strip mall where Lotus is located, so the whole wing of the building can be converted to more Lotus as far as I'm concerned. It would be way better that way, really.

Service has always been kind and friendly whenever I come here, as per Thai tradition. I've only been a couple of times, but with all the stuff I've ordered and shared with my group (it's an extensive menu), I did not find one thing I did not like.

I recommend the jumbo fried shrimp\/prawns to open things up. You can, and should, eat the skin. I don't usually do so with any fried shrimp, but the way it was cooked with the peppering and seasoning, it was almost like having twice as much prawn. Those will disappear in a couple of minutes (because of some secret crack-like substance that the cooks sprinkle into the batter, I'm sure), so I also recommend the yellow curry (though I don't think the color matters...they're all really savory and the spice level can be adjusted to your liking) and the fried, boneless catfish (either with curry paste or garlic pepper sauce). Eat that with a side of salad and some white rice and wash it down with some Singha, and you'll be golden.

As mentioned earlier, you can take a cab here from the Strip if you're visiting from out of town, or drive your own car here. The only problem is getting a cab back to your hotel or next destination. You may want to have the host arrange a ride back for you before you sit down to eat, otherwise, you may have to go out into Sahara Road and flag one down yourself or pray that you find one just emptied of passengers intent on coming here in the parking lot. That would be called ""Lotus luck"" or, winning the Lotus lottery.",11,8,9

Their menu has more variety of Thai food than the number of beers listed in NYC's celebrated Beer bars! - some stand out items - NAM KAO TOD (crispy rice), Deep fried whole red snapper topped with homemade fresh chili and Thai basil, satay, Prawn Garlic Thai style .. etc..

Make reservations because otherwise you're going to wait. Forever. Like maybe until the next day. And that's your fault because why would you not? Is your life so empty that you can afford 45-90 minutes of doing nothing for no reason?

Firstly you feel like you are heading for a mob meeting when you get here. In the strip mall this place is located in you can get all your meth\/stolen goods\/unregistered firearm needs met by speaking to any of the helpful men in trench coats lurking throughout the parking lot.

Our table featured a picture of Mario Batali looking unimpressed. I don't know that I would have put that up there.

The beer list was excellent, the two Thai beers (Chang and Singha) were excellent as well. One oddity: they have Stone Pale Ale on the menu and when ordered I was presented with a Stone India Pale Ale instead, which was not on the menu. It's a completely different beer, but yet a pretty effing good one, so no biggee.

We had eggrolls. They were small and great. Then we had curry; Panang and Red. Also great. Also a fairly UnAmerican portion. You should be able to order a Larger portion of curry, I've never ran out of a main course before. Also their version of a ""7"" in hotness is comparable to a 9 at Pin Kaow. Shit was hot yo.

My SO made reservations here for 7:30 PM, which I'm glad we did, because we were seated immediately. There were groups of folks waiting by the door, and I overheard the host tell a party that the wait would be at least an hour and 30. yikes.

At the servers recommendation, we ordered the Tom Kha soup (he asked how spicy we wanted it on a scale from 1-10). The soup was okay- we ended up mostly pouring it over the white rice.

We also ordered the fried garlic prawns-- right below this dish on the menu, there is a fried garlic prawns with drunken noodles- and that is not the same thing. The server said they use different seasoning for the prawns. I was disappointed by this dish, as I felt it salty and underwhelming. We ended up eating only a couple pieces.

I was deciding between the poached salmon and sea bass- server highly recommended the sea bass so I ordered it with the ginger sauce. The steamed sea bass was very buttery and so good! I would definitely re-order this dish if I come back.

Although I did not enjoy their most popular dish, I would come back to order other dishes and the sea bass. The entrees came out rather quickly (less than 10 minutes) and the service was great.",3,2,0

I have to say that the meal we had was one of the best culinary experiences I have had in my life, no kidding.  The five dishes we ordered were cooked flawlessly in the northern Thai style with wonderful seasonings and herbs.

My recommendations:
Crispy fried shrimp with shell.  Eight large shrimp, enough for the four of us.  Tasty and not oily.
Scallops with chili basil leaves.  Four large scallops cooked perfectly.  My favorite dish.  These were just wonderful.
Drunken noodles with soft shell crab.  Really tasty dish.

I would definitely try to make a reservation or come during off hours because during those busy dinner hours (haven't tried going during lunch yet) this place gets PACKED and you'll have to wait a while. 

Basically, you should go ahead and try everything on the menu. I've had a lot of different dishes and they were all delicious. I would trust this place to make everything taste good, it's THAT good. 

One thing to beware, however, is if you can't eat spicy foods or you don't like pungent foods. Thai food generally has strong flavors because they use lots of herbs and spices and fish sauce pretty liberally. This place takes that to the next level. The flavors are very strong. Also, if you can't eat spicy foods, be careful here. I love spicy foods and prefer my food to be very very spicy (basically, the more it burns\/hurts the better it tastes lol) and when we came here, even though we didn't ever specify spicy level, most of the foods came out pretty spicy. Their papaya salad was surprisingly very spicy. So just be careful. If you can't eat spicy, make sure to tell them that.",1,0,0

So, we'd wake up in the morning, and call ahead to get a reservation, and find out that they didn't take reservations, and it'd be like 2 hours before we get a table. So, we never went there.

Eventually I made it out there, and my friend was right. Crazy good Thai food at reasonable prices, and it is in a highly sketchy part of town.

Fast forward a few years, and now whoever I happen to be eating with, no matter how hardy a Vegas vet they are, is always willing to consider Lotus as a food suggestion. I've tried probably a good third of their menu, and pretty much everything is great.

(As for the ""no reservations"" thing...they don't take reservations FOR LUNCH. You can totally get reservations for dinner.)

If you're coming here, I'd recommend starting with the Prawns in a Blanket. Expertly unshelled shrimp wrapped in bacon, and that is then wrapped in crispy wonton skin and fried to perfection. Served with a sweet dipping sauce.

The crab fried rice is great, and pretty much every curry that you order will complement this.

All of the curries are terrific, and while everything may seem a little on the small side, the combination of the curry sauce and the rice is generally enough to keep me well satisfied. 

Generally, you'll end up dropping about $20-$25 per person here, and have yourself a pretty good meal. I consider this a definite go-to, though I recommend trying to get out there on a weekday rather than a weekend. You'll find the waits much shorter, or may even get lucky enough to walk in and get seated immediately.",1,0,0

I had to wait when I got there but that was not so bad as I could order a good glass of Mosel Riesling and had a book to read.  

I was a bit intimidated by the length of the menu so I asked my waiter for a suggestion that would be off the beaten path so to speak.  He recommended a northern Thai dish which had a meat-tomato ragu of sorts which one would eat by dipping thick slices of carrots, cucumber and other veggies.  Although I did find the tomato sauce to be really too much like an average pasta sauce, I did kind of like the dish and appreciated trying something new.  I did like the Thai chicken wings.

After moving here four years ago, I decided to give it a try.  My first visit was fairly good.  The place was packed.  The decor plain with tons of celebrities on the wall.

My second visit was probably two years ago.  I went with my boyfriend on a date night.  I decided to try some of the more interesting stuff, like tripe, etc.  Of course I was the only one eating these items as my boyfriend is a burger and fries kind of guy.  I think he ordered the Pad Thai.  I made him try a couple of bites.  I'm not sure what I ordered but it was good going down.

A perfect date is not complete without a walk by the Bellagio fountain, which I insisted on.  However, not ten minutes after dinner, I warned my boyfriend that we needed to find a bathroom NOW!  My stomach hurt so badly I was afraid I wasn't going to make it.  We stopped at the first bathroom after the Bellagio self-park as I sat on the toilet balled over in pain.  We walked through the casino and I ran into the bathroom again only minutes later.  We caught a quick fountain show and I ran into the bathroom again.  That's three trips in ten minutes.  I'm sure the security guards thought I had a different ""problem"".  After we made it home, my boyfriend finally got going and spent a good part of the night in the bathroom.  Talk about pain.

I'm not sure what I had eaten that had caused the upset stomach and, I have to say, I was really disappointed.  I will try it again but if I spend another night in the bathroom . . .",3,5,2

I ordered the Thai papaya salad and I got a little disappointed because the flavor is amazing!!!

We order 3 starters and 6 main dishes. Only the following met my expections: Isaan sausage, roast duck curry, and the starter Crispy noodle. The taste was authentic. Everything else was for people who do not know real Thai food. for example, you cannot cook a catfish with Thai holly basil without the holly basil. It is truly a shame. The Pork sate has no resemblance to what the real pork sate is in all over Thailand.
The Isaan soup without any of the Isaan herbs can never be accepted. The Northen pork curry did not taste like anything I had in Northen Thailand. Very unfortunate. On the plus side, the service from the wine stewardess and the food servers were very efficient. We bought a good bottle of red, ordered a bottle of German white and they waived the $25 corkage fee, which is very nice. Not sure what to recommend on Thai restaurants in Vegas.

It was warranted. I tried pretty much everything we ordered. Not one dish was a weak link. I loved, loved, LOVED both the beef tamarind and the butterfly shrimp.

The portions are small, but the prices are a bit higher up. The quality is good though so I guess you can say it offsets it. If you want to eat a lot and cheap, this wouldn't be the place for you. Go another day.

F*cking Slot Waitresses. F.S.W.

But I did remember to take pictures dear readers and I can say everything we ordered was not only downright delectable but tasted just as good, if not better, than anything that I ate in the four weeks I spent in Thailand.

Yes. I said it. And I stand by it with my FlavorBoner held high.


Nam Prik Ong (Red Chili Dip w\/ ground pork) intended to be a starter to your meal, is not too spicy and has just the right amount of sweet from the ground pork. It is awesome with the crudités and chicharones served with it. The cool from the vegetables and the heat from the dip work really well together, even for a drunk ass like myself.

Hey. It was a long drive, all right, and I was on a mission. So... whatever.


Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice) The center of the rice was perfectly moist and soft and the outside was sensationally crunchy. How they did that I have no idea. There was an overall wonderful ginger\/lime flavor going on in this dish with flame coming from the green onion and fresh chilies.  Yum!


Sai Oua (Northern Style Sausage) Fresh, house made, Thai spicy pork sausage. Enough said. Either you get it or you don't. No need to sell it.

""A guy don't walk on the lot lest he wants to buy!""

-- Alec Baldwin, Glengarry Glen Ross

Garlic Prawn. Deep fried in their shell, this dish has a potato chip crunch to it and it's so frickin' garlicky. And I mean that in the best possible way. This is a not to be missed dish for those of you who do not dig anything with hoofs.

Then there was our little crispy drunken Daffy, the Crispy Duck Drunken Noodle. The skin on the bird was indeed crispy and salty. Her meat tender and juicy. The vegetables were cooked yet firm and the bird-based broth that the slippery, wide noodles bathed in was the perfect compliment to the other spicy dishes as it smoothed everything out.

Now not all of the dishes we ordered were from the Northern Thai portion of the menu that everyone recommended, some were chef's choices others, like the drunken noodle, were personal favorites.

Yum Woon Sen: Such a great dish -- my favorite is still Thai Square in DC -- Siam's really didn't do much for me.

Nam Prik Ong: a chili dip with ground pork, tomato and dried spice -- it was not the best thing I ever ate, but it was quite good.

Drunken noodles with Sea Bass: the best dish we had, the fish was cooked perfectly and the noodles were delicious -- my only complaint was the portion size, especially given the price.

Beef jerky Issan style: great flavor, just a little dry and difficult to eat (granted, that could be why they call it jerky!)

Sticky rice with fried banana: delicious!

The meal was fantastic.  Although, I wanted to try some old favorites to compare them to what I know, I ventured out and ordered two dishes I had never had, for the table.

We arrived here on a Sunday at ~7PM.  The wait was about 30 min, which was ok.  Then after we got seated, we had to wait for ~20 min to get our order taken.  We ordered Tom Yum Kai soup, Chicken Sa-Tay as an appetizer, yellow curry, and pad thai.  

After 30 min, the soup was finally served.  It tasted good, it was not hot.  It was warm.. but not HOT.  I need my soup HOT.  Then the sa-tay was served.  It was very good.  

It took them FOREVER to bring the main dishes.  The curry I thought was just average..   But the pad thai was excellent.  It might be the best pad thai I've ever had.  

So I agree that the food is very good here.  But I was not happy that we had to wait for so long to get the food.  I was really disappointed in the warm soup.  I will probably go back to the Thai restaurant we usually go to the next time we are in town.",0,0,0

Why else would semi-inebriated foodies from around the country quietly ask their cab drivers to drive down E Sahara blvd for dinner.  ""The Sahara hotel miss?"" - no cabbie, I said the creepy dilapidated shopping center on Sahara Blvd next to the discount wig shop.  

Once you enter LOS the restaurant itself is much nicer than the location would suggest, and the waitstaff could not be nicer or more attentive.  Best bets include the crispy rice with sour sausage appetizer.  It is literally a party in your mouth - so many different textures and tastes.  There are a bunch of fresh herbs, deliciously crispy rice, cubes of sour sausage, cucumbers, peanuts, chillies, and red onion.  I only wish they would serve it in a giant cereal bowl with a big wooden spoon.  I also love their chicken wings with garlic and pepper.  They are so crispy and addictive, a perfect starter.  For main courses I love all their noodles and curry.  Friends have raved about the scallops as well.  However my favorite dish came on my last visit and was the drunken noodles with giant prawns.  The noodles were wide and spicy atop of lettuce and had a huge portion of perfectly fried shrimp on top.  The dish was amazing if no a bit pricey at $20 - but the portion was very large and included 8 prawns.  

Finally the perfect ending is the mango, sticky rice and coconut ice cream for dessert.  I do not exaggerate when I say this is my favorite dessert of all time.  I have never had better mangoes than those I have at LOS.  Legend says that the chef rejects 75% of the mangoes they receive because they do not meet his standards.  They are the most perfect and sweet mangoes you will ever have.  Best of all, the fine staff at LOS will call a cab for you as you are finishing dessert so that your transportation is waiting for you at the end of your meal.

Lucky me that trip came this year and I knew that Lotus of Siam was the ONE place that was a must-do for me.

Located in a nondescript strip mall about a $15-$20 cab drive away from the main strip, Lotus of Siam is unassuming from the outside but has been praised as one of the best Thai restaurants in America.  We gave the doorman at the hotel the address and as the cab pulled up all he said was ""Lotus of Siam""...no address needed. When you pull up you might be questionable but trust me, looks are deceiving!

Lotus of Siam is open for lunch and dinner and while we had initially planned a lunch visit, we got distracted and pushed it back to dinner. We didn't have a reservation and they were booked for the night so we arrived early right before they opened to secure a seat. If you plan in advance I would definitely make a reservation if you want to eat at a more ""peak"" time, but they do have a bar where you can try a glass from their lengthy wine menu while you wait.

I had done my fair amount of research ahead of time (because I'm a nerd like that) so I knew exactly what I planned on ordering. Lotus of Siam is a bit unique because they offer quite a few Northern Thai dishes, which you don't see on the menus of most Thai restaurants. Our first dish was the very popular Tom Kah Kai soup. Chicken, coconut milk, mushrooms, lemongrass, and lime...this was quite possibly one of the best soups I've ever eaten. We chose a spice level of medium for all of our dishes and found it to be perfect for our taste-a good amount of heat but nothing that was searing away our taste buds.

After the soup came the Garlic Prawns. This is one of their most popular dishes and it's no wonder why...deep fried prawns with shells that crisp up like potato chips, sautéed in a tasty garlic sauce and cooked to perfection.  Delicious!!

Next up...Braised Short Rib with Panang. The short rib wasn't the best I've ever had but the sauce-a red cream curry with cognac-was fantastic and absolutely made the dish. It definitely took some restraint to stop from licking the bowl!

Our last dish before dessert was one of my go-to Thai carry-out choices....good 'ol Pad Thai. But this was no ordinary Pad Thai-this was the best Pad Thai I've ever eaten, and I have eaten A LOT of Pad Thai. The flavors, the spice level, the crispy vegetables, and of course the noodles....I wanted this whole dish to myself!

Last but not least was dessert. We were on the brink of stuffed but I couldn't leave without a few sweet bites. This was actually my first time trying sticky rice and I really enjoyed it. The warm rice with the beautiful, fresh, sweet mango was a great combo and  add in a cold bite of the coconut ice cream...the perfect ending to a great meal!

From start to finish, from wine to dessert and everything in between, Lotus of Siam lived up to all of my expectations and then some. If you're in Vegas I highly recommend venturing off the strip to give Lotus of Siam a try for yourself, I know this has now made it onto my must-do list for all future trips to LV!",5,0,3

Now as you can imagine that is a big statement and something I was weary of, my trepidation certainly wasn't eased once we arrived to the hole in the wall type front door, but then we entered and the place was packed! Our friend ordered her favourite dishes and we were off. The fish was cooked so perfectly it was like a hot knife cutting through butter, then the crispy rice was a playful tease to the taste buds with the sour notes working fantastically with the sausage. My winner winner chicken dinner moment was the duck breast in a red curry sauce. How the hell did they get the skin crispy, flesh like butter and remain that was until the last piece was demolished? I'm guessing some sortie confit was going on here, either way it was my DOD (dish of the day).
Now that I have decided my friend could be correct I. Saying this is the best Thai in the world, the second highlight was the eclectic mix of people throughout the restaurant. From little kids to 60 something millionaires with 20 something plastic brides (good on em). It was definitely an eye opener.

You won't find this back home at your fave Thai joint. Must try garlic prawns, freaking exceptional, do not forget to try this dish.

I told him I had eaten 2 entrees a prior visit. Not another word, just smiled & whipped it out. Perfect timing, water glass kept filled, checked in at exactly the right time, Sonny does it right...

I must admit a yelper on here was right its in a hidden shopping center a creepy one, we went in the day thank goodness if not I would feel unsafe going at night. However, ONE MUST REALLY LOOK PAST THE PARKING LOT. 

As I entered the restaurant it looked like a hole in the wall your expecting this small shack, however you're greeted to a huge wall wine cases with wooden chairs and tables updated decor for a strip mall restaurant. It was very clean and the staff was very friendly. 

So we tried the Chicken coconut soup, the flavor was just amazing you pick a 1-10 spicy rating my hubby picked a 7 and he was burning his mouth, I don't like spicy and I even could not stop sipping and eating this that's how good it was that I ignored the fact it was to spicy for me cause every other flavor was simply amazing. 

The fried garlic shrimp prawns were to die for, the were amazing I am at a tie with Hot N Juice as to which one I would prefer.

I was blown away by the groups of people waiting by the entrance door of the restaurant.  We made out way past the people and found even more inside the waiting area.  We managed to put our names down on the wait list, and the hostess said it would be a thirty minute wait.  We decided we would leave, explore outside, and then come back later.  

Don't judge us for what we decided to do next.  Just a few steps away was a massage parlor.  The GF and I decided to treat ourselves with a thirty minute foot massage.  I wonder if the massage place gives the restaurant a cut of the profits, since I can imagine a lot of the customers also eat there.  The massage was not that great, but that is another review for a different day.  

We came back to the restaurant seven minutes after they had called, informing us that our table was ready.  We were seated fairly close to the entrance, next to a secluded room.  The interior of the dining establishment looked quite remarkable.  Everything looked new, and well maintained.  The exterior was very  misleading.  You would never expect to see such grand chandeliers, a vast wine selection, and well kept furniture.  

We decided to order the fried wontons to start, thai fried rice and khao soi for our main course, and for dessert, we had the fried bananas with coconut ice cream.  The fried wontons were just okay tasting.  I enjoyed their homemade sweet and sour sauce.  As for the wonton , they were a tad overcooked, causing them to dry out. The skin to meat ratio was disproportionate. This was the only item that I felt was not worth the price.  

We ordered the thai fried rice without tomatoes, and with a fried egg on top.  Our server even repeated all the items we ordered back to us.  Somewhere along the way, this was not communicated to the kitchen.  Not surprisingly, there were tomatoes everywhere!  So, we sent it back, and hopefully there was no spit in the new one we received.  I am almost positive they used the same egg from our old one because it was only room temperature.  Overall, the thai fried rice was delicious and the egg was cooked perfectly.  With the slide of the knife, the yolk oozed everywhere.  

The khao soi was definitely the star of our meal.  Be warned that a 6 is super spicy.  You get to choose the spiciness level from 1-10.  It was so good though.  The curry broth had so much explosive flavor.  The noodles were cooked perfectly, and all the ingredients inside the bowl complimented each other perfectly.  My favorite part of the dish was the coconut curry, hands down.  

For dessert, there are three options.  They are ice cream, fried bananas, and mango sticky rice.  We decided to get the ice cream AND fried bananas, which are two desserts.  I have to admit, I have not ever seen fried bananas served without ice cream.  It was surprising that people order it by itself.  When it finally arrived, we were already so full.  I wish there was more ice cream to go with the bananas.  We finished the ice cream with about four more banana pieces left.  

Overall, a very good dining experience.  It was quite nice to get away from The Strip.  Out of the less than ten times I have been to Vegas, this was my first time eating outside  casinos and away from the gambling addicts.  It was a pleasant experience, and I can see why this place is doing so well.",1,1,0

Don't let the outside fool you (we almost didn't enter because of how sketchy it looked at night).  It is great inside.

Dishes for dinner are all in the $20+ range.  A bit pricier than I'm used to for Thai, but it was fine because the quality of the dishes was excellent.

That said, I didn't LOVE absolutely every dish.  The Nam Kao Tod, which everyone raves about, wasn't anything special to me.  Crunchy, spicy, and good, but nothing to write home about.  The pad thai was also very good, but again, nothing to get excited over.

Why the 5-star review then?  Because the dishes that did stand out were AMAZING.

The Garlic Prawns (you eat them shell and all) were a real surprise.  I hadn't intended to order them, but our friendly and patient waiter recommended them when I was floundering with my dish choices.  Holy smokes!  My FAVORITE dish of the night.  So light and crispy, I actually ended up liking the shells more than the meat of the shrimp!

The Sea Bass over Drunken Noodles was PERFECTLY cooked- super moist and flavorful.  I'd have this any day of the week and twice on Sundays.

The Crispy Duck in Panang Curry was so flavorful and fatty.  Mmmm... Definitely rich though, so don't order this if you're feeling like something light.

The braised beef was... wow.  Melt-in-your mouth good.  This, like the prawns, was suggested to me by our waiter, and I'm so glad I went with his recommendations.

Last but not least - the wine.  We had a delicious reisling (surprise, surprise - recommended by the waiter).  It was so good that we took the bottle with us to a nearby liquor store to buy some more.",1,0,0

I had heard that Lotus of Siam was one of Vegas' hidden off-the-strip gems. Little did I know how much of a foodie-find it would be.

When my fiancé and I drove into the dark shopping center parking lot, the one place illuminated, was Lotus of Siam. We walked in and were cordially greeted. We were impressed by the large wine selection and even larger menu. This restaurant features not only your traditional Thai, but interesting cultural blends of Laos, Burmese, and northern Thai foods. 

Yes, you can order the traditional satay, pad thai, and curry. But why? We decided to be adventurous...even though we did order the satay with peanut sauce (to die for). We had some sort of sausage, a duck dish, a northern Thai stew (I specifically asked for the one without the blood in it...yes, they have some dishes with pork blood. I'm an adventurous eater, but not that adventurous. ), and a coconut soup that you just wanted to rub all over your body, it was so good.  I wish I could remember the names of what we had specifically. 

Lotus of Siam certainly lives up to it's reputation of awesome and adventurous food. We're definitely going back next time we're in Vegas. Happy eating!",1,0,0

Lotus of Siam was not one of these establishments.  After hearing rave reviews from Gourmet Magazine, J. Gold and that putu from Kevineats.com, I felt compelled to dine at what many have claimed to be ""The best Thai restaurant in North America"".  Dear readers, I think they may be onto something.

Ditching our group of friends, my Thai paramour and I courageously walked-in to the restaurant without a reservation and were quoted 1:30 wait for a party of two.  Luckily, mi corazon is as fluid in her native tongue as she is easy on the eyes and successfully flirted (right in front of the ignorant farang guests) our way into a table after only 15 minutes.  Yet another example of the eventual geopolitical power shift from the West to the Orient, suckaz!

This would prove to be an auspicious beginning to what would culminate in the best meal of our Vegas trip and quite possibly the year.  Unfortunately for us, we were only a party of two and we also had a pressing engagement at XS after dinner.  Because of this, we weren't able to order the full breadth of the menu (like garlic lobster and crab dishes) but we made do with:

Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice Salad with Issan Sausage)
Khao Soi (Egg Noodles in Coconut broth with chicken)
Crispy Duck with Penang Curry
Garlic Prawns
6 glasses (1 bottle plus 2 additional servings) of Prum 2009 Kabinett Riesling

As corazon expressed to me after the first few bites, this is as good as it gets outside of the homeland.  Granted, she remarked that the cuisine was a bit ""fusion"" and not within strict adherence to traditional Thai cusine, but she was nonetheless glowing with her praise.  As for your humble author, dear readers...  I was in Siamese heaven, fusion or no.

All of the dishes we ordered were excellent, with the Khao Soi and the Nam Kao Tod being my personal favorite.  In addition, the crispiness of the garlic prawns was perfectly married to the garlic infusion and the duck meat was SO juicy and provided a perfect (albeit extremely rich) counterpoint to the Penang curry.  All of the food went amazingly with the J Prum Riesling, a steal at $35 a bottle...

Maybe I had a few too many glasses of the aforementioned wine, because I distinctly remember in between bites whispering to my girlfriend that I wanted to have sex with her on top of all the sumptuous vittles.  Of course, being the modest Thai lady that she is, she shushed me and expertly directed my passions towards the food despite entreaties from your humble author for acceptance of, ""just the tip, sweetie...  come on, just the tip"".  ""OK, OK, later!"" she hissed at me.  What a saint, mi corazon...

Located in a semi-grimy strip mall, the location is nothing special, but the food was several notches above any Siamese cuisine I've had in the states.  Surprisingly, the service was very good as well.  Granted, I'm always expecting treatment at Asian restaurants to be one notch above the brutality that American POW's experienced by the Japanese during the Bataan Death March...  but illustrative of Thailand's ""Land of Smiles"" moniker, the servers were gracious, friendly and efficient.

Total bill came out to $123 for all that food and wine.  Officiously, I took out $25 in cash and gently put it in the payment tray.  

""What, you're not going to pay for the rest of the meal?"" asked my now beleaguered (but very full) girlfriend.  

""Just the tip, sweetie"" I replied slurring...  ""Just the tip.",9,6,6

Or maybe I just didn't order properly. I've had some amazing Thai food and can't say this was better than anything I've had in the past. Some of the Northern style dishes I can't compare but I don't think they were spectacular based on their own merit. But the celebrity endorsements and accolades on the wall can't be wrong can they? 

Let me just start by saying that this restaurant is in a totally sketchy neighborhood. There's even a sign in the restaurant that says that you shouldn't leave your luggage in the car. They have luggage storage in the restaurant so you can bring your stuff in with you. The whole strip mall looks like a bombed out war zone and I'll bet it's pretty scary when it's dark. Like zombies-come-out-and-attack scary. 

It's a nice surprise when you enter the restaurant and see it bustling with, not zombies, but living humans - totally the opposite of the ghost town outside. There does seem to be the illusion that it's busier than it actually is (at least when we walked in). We requested a table for 4. They told us 45 minute wait. We said we'd come back, then they chased us down the parking lot and said 30 minutes, then as we were walking away again, they said they had a table available. When we got in, there seemed to be quite a few open tables. 

As for the food we did as advised and mostly ordered from the Northern dishes at the back of the menu.  

The Spicy Chicken Wings (regular menu) were delicious. My son said they were the best chicken wings he'd ever had. They were crispy and came in just enough chili sauce so the chicken didn't get soggy.

The Seafood Soup (regular menu) was okay. It was pretty spicy. The bowl came with one scallop, two mussels, a prawn and some squid. It was okay but not the best Thai Seafood soup I've had. 

The Red Chili Dip (ground pork in chili sauce) served with fried pork rinds and veggies was pretty bland. It needed salt or something. Everyone basically ignored it after one taste. 

The Garlic Prawns were FABULOUS. Crispy prawns, battered, fried with heads, shells, tails and all. Honestly, the best part were the fried shells - they were like potato chips. My hubby thought they could've used a sweet and sour dip and I agree that might have been nice, but I liked them just fine the way they were. 

The Crispy Duck with Mint Leaves were served on top of noodles in a sauce and topped with some herbs and peppers. Personally, I don't think crispy duck should be served with anything wet (like sauce) because it makes the crispiness go away. I've had some amazing crispy duck and this duck didn't really do anything for me (or my hubby who LOVES crispy duck). 

Fried Bananas with Coconut Ice Cream for dessert was good. Nothing special. They didn't have the sticky rice with mango available. The bananas were wrapped in wonton wrappers then fried. Nothing wrong with that, but I can also make this at home. 

All of this and a couple glasses of wine came out to about $132 before tip. The prawns and the duck were both over $20 bucks. Otherwise, everything else was around $8-15. 

All in all, spicy chicken wings and garlic prawns were good. Everything else: MEH. I might go back and check out the front of menu next time. There are some pretty fine Thai restaurants in the Silicon Valley\/Bay Area that I think are MUCH better.",2,0,0

I'm def. willing to give it another chance though as my friend said she never has bad service there. 

The food was excellent. Most Thai places I've been too felt ""cheap""... this was the only Thai place I've been to that felt ""expensive"" if that makes any sense... like the got high quality ingredients and didn't skimp on the spices. They get an A++ for having a dish with assorted seafood that *GASP* wasn't overcooked or previously frozen for an extended period of time (i.e. rubbery seafood). We had the drunken noodles with assorted seafood as that's what yelpers appear to be having. We also had that peanut sauce beef (beef rama) and fish cakes. All were good.

LOS knows how to do curry really well.  I still think it's kind of weird that their The Crispy Duck with Chu-Chee and Panang taste the same to me.  I tried them side by side too.

I ordered the beef noodle soup and the pineapple fried rice.  The beef noodle soup was pretty good.  It was spicy, but not too bad.  I normally don't like to eat spicy foods, but I was able to enjoy the noodle soup dish.  The pineapple fried rice had a hint of yellow curry, large chunks of pineapple, chicken, and shrimp.

It's about 10-15 min away from the strip. And it's in an old, creepy shopping center, but it's worth going to. All of the awards that you see when you walk into the restaurant are well deserved. This place kills it with their Thai food! And it's cheap....especially compared to what you'll pay eating on the strip!

The only thing I regret about our visit was ordering the Nam Prik Noom (Green Chile Dip) as an appetizer. My husband is obsessed with green chile which is why we ordered it. But we both didn't like it. I honestly am not sure why it is on the menu. The dish is cold. It was pretty much roasted green chilies, chopped up with onion, garlic and tomato. We ordered it spicy so I think they threw some thai chilies in there as well. And it was served with cut up vegetables and fried pork skin for dipping. It didn't taste good. I don't see how this dish is appetizing. I could have made this for myself at home. But why would anybody eat a slice of carrot or cucumber and dip it in green chili at a Thai restaurant? Just seemed random to me. I don't recommend ordering this.

However, for lunch my husband got the Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodle which was incredible!!! Best drunken noodle dish I've ever had. The portion size was big so I ended up eating half of his. The duck was crispy and served on top of pan fried flat rice noodles. The thai basil in the dish really made it flavorful! SO GOOD! Highly recommended!

I ordered the Kao Soi which is egg noodles in a red curry base and a touch of coconut cream. I chose beef for my meat choice and WOW this dish was so hearty, spicy, and flavorful! It tasted like thai comfort food. If you love curry and coconut this is the perfect dish. It was a nice change compared to the curry & rice that I usually eat since this dish comes with noodles. I would order this dish again in a heartbeat!

Overall, AMAZING spot and definitely worth coming to if you love authentic Thai cuisine! A lot of locals in Vegas recommended this place to us and it is a true gem.",0,0,0

I never heard of this place, until my most recent trip to Vegas.  Dishes here are more expensive than the usual Thai restaurant.  In Vegas, you are going to be shelling out tons of money all over the place.  Maybe cut back on a few drinks at the club or a few lap dances less to save a few bucks to try this spot out if it would make you feel better. 

You will find some dishes here that you may not have encountered at other Thai restaurants.  This place gets real packed.  Non-stop taxi's dropping off people every minute it seems.  Make a reservation a day in advance if you have a large group.  There are very limited reservation slots.  

Ordered the Sausage, Deep Fried Garlic Prawns, Fried Peking Duck in Panang, Thai Beef Salad, and Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass.  

My favorites are:

Deep Fried Garlic Prawns - nicely fried, battered, and garlicky.  Enjoyed eating every part of the shrimp.  The skin is separated and deep fried as well.

Fried Peking Duck in Panang - I normally do not eat duck because it has a certain taste, but there are certain meats or dishes that you may not generally like, however, prepared a certain way and you might just fall in love with it.  I certainly enjoyed this dish.  Maybe because it was fried and sliced into thin pieces with thick skin.  Throw it in panang curry and perfect fusion flavor.  Some in the group thought it was a bit oily and greasy, but I did not mind.

Thai Beef Salad - rib eye beef, salad, and thai sweet lime dressing.  Tender beef, good sauce.  This was delicious. 

Sausage and the Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass were good, but were my least favorite.  Sausage had a lot of flavor, but I did not find myself enjoying it more than other sausages that I've had.  Sea bass was cooked well, thick piece, but standard.  The noodles with deep fried soft shell crab sounds something more to my liking.  Maybe I will be back to order that someday.",2,1,1

This is probably the most spacious Thai restaurant I've ever been to - in addition to accommodating multiple large party banquets at the time of our dinner, the restaurant was also serving patrons seated at the full bar (a traditional Thai restaurant with a full bar - classic Vegas; complete anomaly). 

Despite the strong fight put up by the drunken noodles and the tom yum noodle soup, I ultimately went for the pork larb ($8.95) with a side of sticky rice ($2) per my waiter's recommendation on the basis of both popularity and healthiness. According to him, the larb - consisting of ""lean"" ground pork mixed with red and green onions and cilantro bathed in a spicy\/fishy chili lime dressing, accompanied by a few cucumber slices and a petite wedge of raw cabbage - is prepared with no fat and is one of the most popular menu items. While the dish was undeniably tasty, I found it to be wildly underwhelming on the whole - the flavors tasted exactly identical to the seasoning packets used in Mama brand ramen (which I love but don't need to pay restaurant prices for). The biggest disappointment of all was the dismally poor quality of the pork. Contrary to my waiter's word, the meat was EXTREMELY fatty, and I found myself picking out the visible chunks of fat as I ate. I definitely should've gone for the shrimp instead, but we were in a hurry and didn't have time to wait for a new dish to come out. The sticky rice was a more moderate disappointment - the rice used is a longer grain than what I encountered in Thailand, so it was more fluffy than sticky. Save yourself $1 and just order the regular steamed rice. 

Even though I wasn't impressed with what was a solid 2 star meal, I attribute that more to mis-ordering than bad establishment. Service was fantastic, and you can tell the chef takes great pride in the restaurant and cooking\/her food in general. I'm not sure along which basis people can claim this is the best Thai food in America, but I'd be interested in returning if I ever get the chance to try the more specialty \/ creative menu items, such as the drunken noodles and various seafood offerings - I'd just recommend staying away from the pork.",0,0,0

Nam Kao Tod (a puffed crispy rice salad with preserved sour pork sausage) has volumes of flavor (spicy, sour, minty) if you're looking for something different.
Try Nam Prik (a composed room temperature chili based salad),  Jackfruit salad, Hung Lay (pork curry braised down with garlic and ginger), Northern Larb (their version of comfort food).

my bf and I went here during our spring break trip to Vegas. he heard of this restaurant from a Foodie friend and really wanna take me here.

the next day we were looking for places to have a quick dinner before heading to the airport. as I was curious how this restaurant was able to deserve such a good review on Yelp, I proposed we try this place! we arrived exactly at 5:30, hoping to get in immediately when it opens. and guess what? there was already a very long waiting line in front of the restaurant! definitely a good sign! 

as soon as we were able to get into the restaurant, a waiter comes to us with a charming smile asking if we had a reservation or not. (so apparently they take reservations and can be overly booked) we expressed our need to catch a flight and the waiter was very kind in finding a seat for us as quickly as possible. when we sat down and started to checking out the interior of the restaurant, we realized where the  owner have spent all her money. the interior decoration looks like a fancy, high-class dining room with chandeliers, hard wood tables and chairs, mirror-like clean floors and a huge wine collection!

it's quite unfortunate we were not able to try the wine due to time constraints and we only had one dish as neither me nor my bf was hungry. we tried the crisp duck curry  as recommended and it turns out to be really really great! the duck was crispy outside, juicy inside and when the curry swims in your mouth, you would want to bite your tongue off! I also ordered a Thai ice tea and it doesn't fail to surprise me either!

Meals:
Crispy duck panang: so so so good. I wish it had come with more sauce, but there was enough for all of us to enjoy. The sauce was delicious and the crispy duck was perfect. This was my favorite dish!

Garlic prawns: another delicious dish!  The skins are separated from the actual prawn so you can eat the prawn, then the skin. So tasty and crispy. I actually only ate one though bc I was obsessed with the duck dish.

Spicy sausage (from the Northern menu, forget the Thai name):  the guys I was with wanted this. I didn't like it. They liked it but said they wished it had some kind of sauce with it.

Once you walk through however, it is surprising how classy and well put together this restaurant is!

I've been lucky and haven't had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table here, but i would suggest calling ahead to be safe.  The staff here is very professional and friendly and the feel is very authentic.

I always order the Pad Thai because I am very interested in how each place puts their spin on it.  Lotus of Siam has a very good Pad Thai but not the best I have ever had, so i can't warrant giving it a 5 star rating.

I will say that the menu is very expansive and the price point is great considering how well put together everything is inside and all the buzz going around town about it.

Well, this isn't a fancy restaurant, it's not in a nice area, and nobody should ever get the buffet.

If you do go here, don't order items that you have enjoyed at your neighborhood Thai restaurant back home.  The best items on the menu here are the ones that you probably have never eaten before.  A lot of the things that are staples at Thai restaurants are served at Lotus of Siam, but they are not done with a flourish and they might even be disappointing.

I've eaten at this restaurant about a dozen times, and there have been some mediocre meals and some truly outstanding meals.  The charbroiled beef dishes are all excellent, the seafood dishes are consistently great, and some of the curries are interesting and delicious.  There are some good dishes on the Northern menu, but there have been some that I haven't enjoyed as much.  The first time I went to Lotus of Siam I ordered the crispy rice appetizer, and I have ordered it on every subsequent visit.  The flavor of that unusual dish is simply amazing.  Also, the coconut ice cream with sticky rice is a perfect end to a spicy Thai meal, and at $4 it isn't too costly, either.

So, if you want to enjoy the food here, don't go for something you've already had elsewhere.  Ask the waiter for a recommendation (they have ALWAYS given me good advice), get the crispy rice, a glass of Riesling, and finish up with dessert.  Oh, and make a reservation, or you'll be waiting a really long time for a table.",0,0,0

My all time favorite is the Crispy Duck with Penang Sauce. I actually don't like duck, not even what I've had in France or Beijing, which they're known for, but the duck here so good I've made an exception. It's crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. A rare and winning combination in my book.

Not bad but not great. We then ordered crispy salted prawns, crispy duck curry and soft shelled crab drunken noodles. The duck curry was amazing! We all loved it. The prawns were equally impressive. They fry the prawns and shells separately by the way. So crispy and delicious! There was nothing special about the drunken noodles other than the crabs.

Comments: This has one of the most extensive and authentic Thai menus I've seen in the US beating out many places in California by a long shot.

Notable recommendations would be the soft shell crab pad kee mao (drunken noodles), the crispy garlic prawns appetizer (fried shrimp shells are edible and yummy), nam khao tod (a Lao dish with sour pork and crispy rice). There are curries, massaman, Lao dishes, Issan province dishes, and more. Wine selection focuses on Riesling, which range from $20-65 per bottle.",0,0,0

We weren't sure this place would live up to the hype, but it absolutely did.  We came 10-min after it opened on a Saturday night, and already there was an hour wait.  We debated if we should stay, but since it was still pretty early we decided to wait it out.  Tip #1 - Don't be like us.  Make a RESERVATION.

In the waiting area, there are laminated articles and accolades plastered from wall-to-wall.  They've won so many James Beard awards, and have been named THE best Thai restaurant in the country.  High praise!

We only wished that we came with a large group of people so we could try more dishes, but since we had an hour to kill we had plenty of time to decide what to get.   It took us forever to settle on a few dishes because everything on the menu sounded delicious!  I would recommend trying stuff that's from Issan, Northern Thailand, or Chef's choice because c'mon... you can get Pad See Ew and Pad Thai anywhere.   

This is what we ordered:
-  A cup of Tom Yum Koong soup
-  A cup of Tom Kah Kai soup
-  Shrimp in a blanket (shrimp wrapped with bacon and wonton wrappers then deep fried).  
-  Crispy duck with Panang Curry
-  Soft Shell Crab with Drunken Noodles

Everything was DELICIOUS.  My favorites were the soups and soft shell crab with drunken noodles.  The depth of flavor they were able to infuse into the soups really made them memorable.  You could taste all the wonderful flavors of Thailand in those little cups - lemongrass, lime, chili, etc.  Mmm... 

The soft shell crab was perfectly fried and layered beautifully atop the flat noodles (like the ones they use for Pad See Ew).  There were so many popping flavors that the dish still danced on my tongue hours after we had eaten.  I highly recommend this dish!

I was least impressed by the Crispy Duck Panang Curry even though it was still good.  I think I like really unique, bold flavors and the red panang curry tasted pretty similar to other Thai places.  The deep fried duck was good, but nothing beats Chinese peking duck - I couldn't help but compare.

Can't wait to come back again.  This place is a must try for those who enjoy Thai food!",7,3,4

I first heard about this place on yelp, because I was curious on what Thai restaurant in Vegas had the highest reviews, and it was this one!

Location: hidden in an unpopular plaza, and the sign saying ""lotus of Siam"" is quite outdated. From the outside it looks very small, but don't be fool, the restaurant is way bigger than it looks!

Interior: signs and many awards of the glorious food. And many celebrity photos hung around the walls. Also, they have carpet that is kept super clean! I didn't see one big stain at all! Once you enter you'll see a huge glass window, which they store their wines. Pretty cool I might say. 

Food: For the entrees, I got the chicken pad Thai ($10.95) and chicken panang ($12.95) which comes with one bowl of rice. 

Chicken Pad Thai ($10.95): seriously the best I've ever ate! They don't disappoint. Everything tasted so fresh and they had a good ratio between the noodles, meat, and veggies. Other Thai restaurants they put too much green sprouts in the noodle and\/or they put too much eggs or cook the egg weird. They made sure everything tasted perfectly. 

Chicken panang ($12.95): I was super excited to try this. I got a 3\/10 for spice level since I don't like too spicy. I tasted this curry, and it's by far the best curry I ever had. The curry wasn't too thick and it was at an accurate, mild spice. I definitely would get this every time I go there! It's a must have!

Fried bananas ($8.50): i was nervous that the fried part of the banana would be overbearing and make me sick but it totally didn't. The fried bananas aren't oily at all. It came out crispy and they added shredded coconut in the fried bananas also. They lightly put powdered sugar and caramel sauce on it. Definitely a great way to end my meal! 

Thai tea ($2.50): Thai tea at other places are way too sweet but this place didn't make me feel like I was gonna have diabetes. The Thai tea tasted heavenly. The creamer that they put in their Thai tea definitely makes their drink stand out from other restaurants. 

Service: I made reservations at 7:30pm on a Monday night. We got sat down right when we came inside and once we ordered our food, we received it within 10-15mins! Not a long wait at all! I like how they were smiling and always refilling our waters without us asking them. This restaurant was busy, but they were running things very smoothly. I ended up giving a few more dollars in tips because of their service :]

Cons: Entrees are pretty pricey for small portions and I didn't like how they gave us the check right when we got our desserts. I felt very rushed and agitated since there were several people waiting for a table. 

Overall, GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE! I love lotus of Siam!!",3,0,1

Wine: No matter how many times I come here, I am consistently blown away by both the varietal selection and the very reasonable prices. Their ""house cab"" is a wonderful CA cab, Hoopes. The price per glass is essentially 1\/4 price of the bottle I have bought from the store. Not sure how they do that, but gives you an idea of the reasonableness of their pricing. As always, their Riesling selection is unparalleled.

For appetizers-- Stuffed chicken wings and Nam Kao tod. Both were delicious and would definitely recommend. 
For entrees- Khao Soi with duck and Kang Hung Lay. I really enjoyed the Khao Soi, but wished I had tried with the chicken instead. But the hubby liked the duck. The Kang Hung (I think this was the name) was very yummy and tender.
For dessert- had the Fried bananas with coconut ice cream. 

I would definitely return and try other things on the menu, but preferably with a larger group so that we could have multiple things. I would also recommend to eat in the larger dining rooms, we were put in the small one and it was too loud. I had to yell to talk to my hubby.

Actually, I suspect, but don't know, that this is not the best Thai food in Vegas. I ate there a few times with my wife (we are both vegans). There were lots of vegetarian options, but it was very hit and miss. Some food was actually pretty good, and some very boring. Probably the worse was the ""Thai salad"": Note to staff, just putting peanut sauce on iceberg lettuce does not make it Thai.  

The staff were very friendly, but you really get a sense that you have to fit the rhythms of the restaurant. We went in at 9pm one night (kitchen closes at 9.30pm - at least during weekdays) and the last half of our meal was punctuated with the sounds of the vacuum cleaner (this also happened on another occasion when we in the last part of lunch). Really it is difficult to have a peaceful meal and enjoy your food when people are making a huge noise while you are trying to eat. Also the lighting is really harsh at night. Much calmer for lunch than dinner. Spicing is on a 1:10 scale and be aware that 10 is v. hot.

It is a big relief to be off the Strip though so we went back and the food was OK if not too great. It's about $12-$15 cab ride from the Strip.  Prices are reasonable.

- Pad Kee Mow: This isn't one of the popular menu items, but I thought it was executed the best. The noodles had a nice texture to them and the flavor of the noodles were pretty good overall.
- Crispy Duck with Panang Curry: The duck was just ok, but the curry was really tasty. The downside is that this dish is like $20 for a few measly pieces of deep fried bird.
- Pad Thai: Another typical Thai restaurant item, but the noodles here are really thin and the color doesn't appear to be as artificially orange as at other places.
- Service: They have really great service here. Waiters always stopped by to fill glasses of water and always with a smile. 
- Variety of choices: This restaurant's menu is literally a book. It is HUGE. Here you will find Thai dishes from all different regions, and all seemingly pretty tasty.

Just ok:
- Drunken noodles with crab: Most excited to try this, but the crab was disappointing. It was so fried that it was soft and soggy. 
- Nam Kao Tod: The crispy fried rice appetizer; this had a funky sour taste, but I was the only one at my table that didn't enjoy it so to each his own!

The good thing is that their menu is so extensive that picky eaters will have to find something to like. The not so good things are that portion sizes aren't huge for what you're paying for. Also, just to note, they make their food SPICY (even mild is hot hot hot), and if you make reservations there's a 5-minute grace period for your party to arrive by. Not so forgiving :\/ Ultimately, I'm not sure if it's worth making a trip out of the strip for again, but worth a try!",0,0,1

I really like the house special flat noodles with crawfish. Their wine list is fantastic and much more reasonably priced than other places that boast great wine lists. Alas, the beer is limited to the standard weak Asian lagers and domestics, but if its fantastic beers I want I just go to the Himalayan Cuisine instead. The sommelier here is a very affable man and after chatting him up I was able to twist his arm and offer him a little taster of the Bergstrom Pinot Noir I had one night.

I can understand why this place is so popular, and let me tell you, the wait is definitely worth it, but make a reservation in advance if you can!  (Tip: I have heard that it isn't as packed for lunch if you want to casually show up, but for dinner, especially if you're visiting, MAKE A RESERVATION, even as far as a month ahead of time, so you do not miss out!)  There is a very large menu here, making it nearly impossible to narrow down what you want to order.  Of course, you have the Thai dishes that you would normally see at any Thai restaurant, but you also have their specialty Northern Thai menu, which is a MUST to order from (taken advice from Anthony Bourdain!).

Our order:
-We ordered the satay as our appetizer, which was DELICIOUS, tender, and flavorful, with the perfect peanut sauce to pair it with.  It was not chewy or dry at all, as from other restaurants in our experience.
-The Pad Thai was very good, with generous and large pieces of shrimp, and I would say better in flavor than your average restaurant.
-From the Northern menu, we ordered the Khao Soi... I love Thai curries, and this was by far the best that I have ever had!  The duck was perfectly cooked and crispy, the curry itself, despite looking heavy, was actually very light on the stomach, and the flavor was just slightly spicy and not overpowering.  The curry and coconut flavor paired perfectly with the egg noodles that came with it, and I am positive would taste amazing over some fried rice.

We wished that we could try more, but the dishes were very large and could be shared between a few people each, so we will have to wait for our next trip here to try the Panang curry and some of the other dishes!

We walked in without reservation and had a short wait of 25 minutes.

We began with Nam Kao Tod (crispy rice). The dish was not to my taste, as the sourness of the lime was too overpowering.

Next we had the Tom Kah Kai. This mushroom soup with a coconut milk based broth proved inedible despite our best efforts and was unquestionably the lowlight.

We ordered drunken noodles with soft shell crab as our first entree. The noodles were passable but soggy, the crab meat was chewy.

Our final selection, the musaman curry with tofu was mediocre, but the highlight nonetheless. It also had an unusual but pleasant sweetness.

Though the food was a disappointment, staff was prompt, friendly, and attentive with wait staff checking in frequently (though not too often).

The price was also very reasonable for Las Vegas.

Yes it really took me this long to try it. And yes, you can kick me for it! (as long as you bring some wings when you do). 
Ok, first, let me tell you the story of many years ago. My mom took me here for the lunch buffet. I stuck my nose up like, what the heck is my mom trying to get me to eat here. Well let's just say I made a recent call to my mom saying, ""I am so sorry I didn't like Thai food at a younger age, you were right"". I am sure she enjoyed that. 
I have yet to come here for dinner, and I have yet to try any of these specials that are frequently talked about. However, in the past two weeks, I have come here 3 times for lunch. I get my usual that I normally get when eating Thai food. Garlic & black pepper chicken, green beans and beef, basil fried rice, drunken noodles, or yellow curry. Just a few classic personal favs. I have plans on venturing into the Northern Thai portion of their menu. I recently had their wings as an appetizer. I brought back the three leftover wings to co-workers. Three out of three of them asked where those amazing sweet chili wings came from. I will win them over bringing leftovers from this place. 
Now, let's talk about spice! If you have read any of my reviews, you know I like SPICY!! It grinds my gears when I go to eat any place, they claim something is spicy, and it doesn't make me sweat. Don't tease me! I usually get anywhere from a level 6 to 8. In the past, Pan Asian has been the only place I have had to step back, wipe off the sweat, and shake the hand of the chef to thank them. Well, on my first experience here at LOS, I knew, I had found a place on my level. 
I ordered my pepper chicken at a level 7, and let's just say my Thai ice tea did not last over half my meal. From now on, I will stick with a level 5 or 6 here. Well done Lotus of Siam. There is a competitor in the parking lot, and their level 8 did not even make me turn red. (CUE WAMP WAMP MUSIC)

My foodie best friend had already been here, but I had not. Our goal was to order their specialties (Northern Thai cuisine) and items that we probably can't get as easily at other basic Thai restaurants. We ordered four total dishes (most tables had 1 dish per person), and definitely had leftovers for drunchies later that weekend.

CRISPY DUCK IS LIFE. So we tried the crispy duck khao soi. This curry sauce sits on egg noodles. The curry is good, but the duck is the star. It is everything you want from duck. The meat is flavorful and tender, and the skin is just perfection-- crispy, crunchy, and just craveable. I'm drooling as a write this review.

We also tried the northern larb. This is different from the typical larb you find at other Thai restaurants. It was made with ground pork, and does not contain lime. It was so flavorful and herbacious.

I guess the most disappointing dish was the northern style tom kah kai. We honestly could have skipped this one. This was different because it didn't use coconut cream, so it was a clear broth. It was super acidic and tart-- it reminded me of sinigang!

The biggest surprise for us was the nam kao tod, which was an appetizer with crispy rice, pork sausages, herbs, and was actually sour and spicy. It was really good, and it gave me the salty and the sour, and the spice. 

There's so many dishes I want to go back and try too... i.e. drunken noodle soft shell crab. Yes, deep fried soft shell crab on top of spicy stir-fried flat rice noodles.

The noodles made for a messy meal, because the curry splashed around as I ate the noodles. The crispy duck was something I've been craving ever since.

The food came quickly, and our waiter was always nearby if we needed anything. He also came and brought a bucket of ice for our wine - something unexpected at a Thai restaurant.

Pad See Ewe w\/chicken (4.5\/5)

Very tasty and full of flavor, this is the dish I was most impressed with during my meal. Just the right combination of sweet and salty. Portion was just moderate, not generous but also not too small. I enjoyed the pad see ewe very much and will definitely order it again.

Larb (1.5\/5)

Quite the disappointment, both in terms of taste and portion size. First of all, the portion size was surprisingly miniscule and left me wanting more food. Not necessarily more of this larb, just more of some kind of food. Taste was also a let down as the portion tasted very bland. No more larb from LOS for me.

Service (3\/5)

We apparently went during the lunch rush, so it was quite busy. The service was adequate, but nothing outstanding. Granted, they were slammed, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.

Ambiance\/ Room (2\/5)

I dig enjoy the wine cellar and bar area. Very cool. Otherwise, it seemed like an old, tacky mish mosh of items. Plus the tables are squeezed in too tight together, IMO. I could easily hear conversations around me with no effort at all. Plus the actual location is in a pretty sketchy area to begin with.

Although they have some safe and Chinese inspired dishes, which I think they should cut from the menu, their specialty is Northern Thai and the surrounding regions. Dishes can be small but that can be an excuse for your party to try more things. You won't regret it.

Don't confuse this place with some of those Thai places that try to be gourmet but stray too far from authenticity. This is real deal, gourmet Thai cuisine. Take it from me or not but I am Thai and have been to Thailand many times and I think I agree with the writer from Gourmet Magazine that this is ""The best Thai food in North America"". I 'll even go as far as saying it is better than most restaurants in Thailand.

The service id good, plating is nice and decor is pretty crappy but it doesn't really matter when the food is this good.

Price $20-30 per person for dinner. 

It's located in a dodgy strip-mall consisting of massage parlors and shady looking bars, restaurants and all the riff -raff they attract but I'll gladly dodge a few bullets to eat here again.

I give Lotus of Siam 5 stars based on the taste and quality of it's food. I usually reserve this for ultra elegant, flawless in all ways, destination restaurants.

Our waiter was able to recommend four things and even threw in something we had never tried. I love that.  We had a rice appetizer that I had never heard of. It was spicy rice roasted in mix of exotic spices. Totally unique and delicious. Then we had crispy ribs with a nice garlicky sauce on the side. Falling off the bone yummy. After that we had Khoa Soi with chicken. It's a coconut curry soup with rice noodles and crunchy noodles in a curry soup with many layers of flavor.

At first glance, the buffet doesn't look like much -- especially when compared to other buffets offered on the Strip. But for $10.99, you get a pretty thorough representation of traditional Thai offerings. I'm not sure if the selections change daily, but today there was no beef or seafood; however, there were plenty of chicken, tofu, and vegetable dishes to go around. There was also a lot of fried fare, including egg rolls, shrimp and curry puffs, tempura vegetables, and fried banana (basically, a banana egg roll). 

I steered clear of the fried food and headed straight for the chicken noodle soup, which is one of my favorite things at Lotus. I don't think this is on the regular menu, and it's not what you would consider traditional chicken noodle soup, but I could eat this all day. It looks like a hot and sour soup with ground chicken and wide rice noodles, but it has a hint of spice (anise?) that's addictive. I've had this with duck on the buffet before and it was fantastic, but this is almost as good. My husband was not as pleased with the egg drop soup, which could more appropriately be called ""cilantro soup with egg."" (He has that weird gene where cilantro tastes like soap, so any cilantro at all is too much for him. I love cilantro, but it was a little overwhelming for me, too.)

The main courses included pad thai, pad woo sen, curry chicken, chow mein, and ginger tofu (listed in order of my preference). There are orange slices and cantaloupe for dessert along with the aforementioned banana egg roll. (I consider this last item a dessert option. Don't be like my husband and mistake it for a savory dish -- it sure tastes crappy with soy sauce on it!)

Newbies and foodies may want to order off the extensive menu, but for anyone in search of a quick and tasty Thai lunch, I suggest trying the buffet (if, for nothing else, one of the best soups in town).",0,0,1

Most of the table ordered spice level 1-4*, and I went with a 6, and still felt virtually nothing, even though my crispy duck panang looked like it'd pack a punch. Pad thai (yes, someone ordered it), was the usual. Basil chicken was forgettable.
Green chile dip was fine. The famous garlic prawns had maybe 2 pieces with actual meat, the rest was batter and\/or shells. Thai Teas were standard. We got dessert elsewhere, as they were out of the mango and nothing else sounded appealing.

TIP: Call in your reservation, as there was availability despite their site seeming booked for weeks. In fact, we really didn't need our reservation for 5 (which we were shocked they so easily let us change from 4 at the last minute, until we arrived: Somehow the place was absolutely dead at 8:30pm on a Friday)...sure, I know it's Vegas and not everyone just eats the whole trip, but don't people hit the strip at all hours, and isn't this place supposed to always be mobbed?

* Time your attack. If you're in town for a major convention you have to get there VERY early or else make reservations well in advance for a large party, otherwise you will wait 90 minutes or more. (If you want to call ahead, note that when the restaurant is closed, up till 5 pm, they simply don't answer the phone.)

* Be sure your hotel room has microwave and refrigerator. That way you can order with abandon and know you can take the leftovers to enjoy another day.

* When they ask you ""how spicy"" tell them no more than a 5 or 6 or you truly will have your taste buds blown away. I say this as someone who regularly puts Tabasco in many dishes at home.

* Take time to study the enormous menu (grab one while you're waiting for a table}, or just throw yourself on the mercy of your server after telling them you want the northern\/Issan dishes. You will note that many of the salad-y dishes have common ingredients of chili and lime and red onion. Don't get more than one or two of these unless you are at a big table sharing because the flavors will be too close together and the chilis will blow you away for the rest of the meal. Likewise, the finely chopped Issan dishes are complex and subtle but they are close enough in flavor that they should be enjoyed on subsequent visits, not on the same night. (Unless, again, you are a large party and can order a few of these to share and sample.)

* If you're there at lunch, resist the temptation to just get the inexpensive buffet. It's totally different stuff.

* Pace yourself and use discipline when tasting among the different dishes. The food arrives when it is ready; the kitchen seems to have no interest in giving you a soup first, then a salad, then a more substantial dish with rice. If you want your meal organized this way, you'll have to do it yourself. 

If I am by myself, here's the strategy I will use for my next several visits as I order my way through the menu.

* Start with a soup. Most of these are Thai standards but the kitchen is so good with different ingredients I would expect them to be great renditions. Anyway, you can't go wrong with the Northern Style Thom Kha Gai (item M on the Northern menu): amazingly light, fresh tasting, spicy and redolent of lemon grass, a perfect food I could gulp by the quart.

* Now a northern\/Issan specialty--or two or more, if you're sharing. Have this before the salad because the flavors are subtle. Some favorites are Nam Kao Tod (crispy rice with very finely chopped sausage) and Kang Hung Lay (garlicky northern pork stew, a smallish portion). This last visit I had #61 Hok Mok Plar, catfish ""in a hok mok chili sauce"" which is like a curry, but eggy--strange and wonderful.

* Now a Thai salad, which you've resisted or just nibbled at because of the chili factor. On your first visit, the choice is simple: crispy catfish salad. It's like a good green papaya salad, but with amazing bits of fish. My last visit I had #14 Larb Koong and was very pleased. Catfish again, but finely chopped, marinated and folded into crispy rice.

* At this point you have spent a lot of money and you probably aren't particularly full, so I would pad my menu with a curry served with rice. My last visit I tried Kha Nom Jean Nam Ngyow (#G on the northern menu, rice vermicelli curry) and was disappointed--oily and not a lot of flavor. Next time I'll try a standard Panang or red or green curry which will also bring my per-item average cost down. 

* Dessert? I am generally too sated when I get to this point but if you want dessert the mango with sticky rice is a delightful and popular choice.


* Don't be shy about asking the kitchen to pack the uneaten bits to go--they expect this. They get a lot of takeout orders from people who are taking the food on the plane, or get frustrated at a 2 hour wait for a table. And it's your food--you've paid for it!",6,2,3

My girlfriend and I came here on our last trip as recommended by yelp, and wow am I glad we tried it. The area didn't exactly look promising, but once we saw the crowd inside, we knew something was up. We knew we were about to have an awesome meal.

Food - We started with the Nam Kao Tod, which is Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. The spiciness was perfect, although too much for my spice-sensitive gf, but she still enjoyed it enough to brave through it. Yum. 4 out of 5

Then we had the Tom Kha Gai as recommended by the waitress. This is when I knew I had to rave about this place on yelp. The taste was perfect. It was the taste that I would compare all tom kha\/yum variations to. Noone else comes close. Seriously. 6 out of 5? lol

Of course, we had to try the Pad Thai. My girlfriend and I always judge the quality of a Thai restaurant based on their pad thai. Why? Because every Thai restaurant has it and it is probably the most popular Thai dish in the US, thus, every Thai restaurant should not only have it, but they better deliver in quality. They did not disappoint. This was the best Pad Thai I've ever had. another 6 out of 5.

Service - our waitress was a Thai lady. She practically recommended all of the dishes we ordered and even recommended which spices to use to bring out the flavor even more. Such a sweet lady =] she got a huge tip :P

Price - It's the price you'd expect to pay at a Thai restaurant.. ;) I'd gladly pay for each dish. Twice.

the nam prick did me dirty. a 4 spice level sends a hallucinary level of spice through me. the thing was, it was so good on the first bite that i took like 15 more too quickly. then the heat set in.

the food arrived in a timely sequence. the papaya salad, at a level 3 was actually more manageable. at this point my face is already red and dripping, but i just kept eating knowing the khao soi would be my relief.

     Before the James Beard Award and the Gourmet Magazine review, Lotus of Siam was a small little hole in the wall located in Commercial Center in Las Vegas.  You got to take a cab drive to this ghetto side of town, but you will enjoy it and get your Thai fix here. 

- Nam Kao Tod - crispy rice salad, minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice - so good!

- Miang Kham - It is often sold in the street, with the ingredients wrapped separately in small plastic bags.  Filled with roasted coconut shavings and the following main ingredients chopped or cut into small pieces: Shallots, Fresh red or green bird's eye chili peppers, Ginger, Garlic, Lime - hit the spot.

- WOON SEN SOUP - Cellophane noodles with minced chicken, sliced black mushrooms and onion in clear broth.

- Yum Woon Sen - Cellophane noodles, onions, with combination of seafoods mixed with chili and lime juice. Served on bed of greens. 1 of my favorite dishes here.

- LARB KOONG OR PLAR DOOK - catfish or shrimp - Minced shrimp or catfish, chopped onions, fresh and dry chilis, lime juice. Served with fresh cabbage. Delicous.

- GINGER FISH Deep fried whole pompano fish, topped with ginger, onions, and black mushroom sauce. Oh how it hits the spot!

    Amazing wine selection of Riesling KABINETT, SPÄTLESE, AUSLESE, you name it they have it, and also by the glass as well.

   I also love to come here for the lunch buffet when I'm attending CES. Too bad they discontinued the buffet now ;-( Service is always good, reservation is highly recommended.",13,5,12

But first - do not be alarmed when you actually find the place.  In a very shabby strip mall well off The Strip - a few crappy stores and eateries, a few boarded up places, a smattering of panhandlers and transients (trying real hard to be politically correct).  Look past all this and go in the front door - and prepare to be pleasantly amazed.

Very large restaurant - crowded, hell of a wine cellar (in a Thai place - must be a Vegas thing).  Bit of a wait but not intolerable.  Polite and knowledgeable staff - and willing to take the time to explain the enormous menus and really help with your selection.

Started off with deep fried tofu and beef larb - off to a very good start.  A variety of main courses - and just a ridiculous amount of offerings to choose from.  Finally settled on the Rad Na, Nua Nam Tok and Koi Soi - all prepared well, plenty to eat and enough to share.  A good sampling for future visits.  Strong but not too strong Thai Ice Tea to wash it all down.

Just remember - suck it up and make your way inside.  Well worth it",0,0,0

Don't let the exterior or location off the strip fool you. Lotus of Siam is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas (and I'm a vegas native), hands down. It's quite possibly my favorite restaurant period. I follow them on instagram and just drool over every photo.

My typical experience begins with Tom Yum soup with shrimp. We get a pot for the whole table. I can honestly say you've never had Tom Yum soup like this. You can taste each ingredient separately, but also all together. It's a symphony in your mouth!!!

I always have a hard time deciding what to get for an entree. The sea bass drunken noodle!!!! Is the best thing ever. The tom Yum noodle soup (yes, double the tom yum). I once read a review that said that the noodle soup is to tom Yum what bouillabaisse is to fish stock. All the curries are amazing. The crisp duck curries are also very popular.

On the northern menu, there is a delicious vermicelli bowl!!!! You can ask for it without tripe.  

Next time I'm going to try the soft shell crab! 

They also have an award winning wine list.

The prices are incredible reasonable ranging from 9-15 on average with the sea bass and crab items in the high 20s low 30s. 

You will need to get a reservation a few days in advance, OR you can show up 15 mins before they open at 5:30 and be seated immediately.  I can't speak to their buffet.

I came a large group of people and we ordered the nine most popular dishes. And I must say that nothing about any of the food stood out.  I couldn't find a flaw with the taste or texture, but nothing about the food captured me. It was a bit of a let down, the food was still good, but everyone I was with felt the same way.

Meat can be loaded with gristle, overcooked, or undercooked. Curry can be oily, watery, too spicy, or too bland. Noodles can be too grainy or too soft, and break easily. 

Lotus of Siam pretty much hit the mark on all of these counts for me. Here's our breakdown:

- Chicken satay. Perfectly seasoned and cooked chicken. This is usually the canary in the coal mine for me. The chicken was good quality, perfectly cooked, and seasoned so well that I didn't even feel the need to use peanut sauce.
- Yellow curry with chicken. This is mostly the reason for my 5 stars. It's my habit to only eat the chicken and the curry sauce on my rice, but on these two counts, Lotus of Siam is among the best of the best for this dish for me. The consistency was perfectly creamy, and ""medium spicy"" (4 out of 10, I think was what we asked for) provided the perfect amount of spice for those of us who don't like a ton of spice in our curry. The chicken was again fantastic quality and perfectly cooked.
- Pad see ew. This was a good dish. The noodles were prepared well, and the beef was very good!
- Crispy duck. This was mostly okay for me, although I'm not a big fan of duck to begin with. The seasoning was definitely the highlight of this dish for me.

We got there right around 1pm on a Monday - today and it was busy. We had to wait about 35 minutes for a table of 2. We were told by the waitress that the buffet was closing in 25 minutes so we could order that or order off the menu. We chose to order off the menu.

We ordered an appetizer and two items off the Chefs Choice.
For drinks we got a Thai beer - Singha and then a Thai Iced team - which tasted like candy.


Our appetizer was  GARLIC BLACK PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS - the wings were big and fried perfectly well. The garlic was definitely in full force but really yummy.

Entrees included: GARLIC PRAWNS - which were really fantastic. Cooked perfectly and seasoned very nicely. The prawns came on top a small bed of lettuce, carrots, cilantro and a delicious sauce. This would be a great appetizer even for the table if you had a party of 4.

and

KHAO SOI BRAISED SHORT RIB - this was really great. the short rib was incredibly tender. The curry was just the right amount of spicy. 

Service was a little slow. It seemed like they had just gotten slammed and we were coming in right at the end of lunch rush. It took a while to get our food and it took a while for them to take the food away, get our bill and then for them to take  and run the credit card so we could leave.  I felt like they were rushed and so some customer service steps were definitely skipped. like checking back on us after we got our appetizer so we could order our drinks. I had to ask the food runner for drinks when he dropped off the entrees because the waiter never popped by to check on us. Not a huge deal - but when we placed our initial order we told the waiter we were debating on our drinks and asked to keep the menu so I was pretty sure he was looped into knowing we wanted to order drinks.

Food was pretty killer and I would highly recommend it. My hope is next time we come with more people so I can try many more things and I want to thank my hubby for eating a curry dish when hes not the biggest fan :)",1,0,0

That's right folks, every bite at Lotus of Siam makes each minute stuck in traffic\/wasting gas\/ road rage worth it. While we were about to make our way to the strip for king crab legs at Vegas Style Buffets, a friend persuaded us to eat this ""Best Thai Food in North America"". The thought of eating Asian food in Vegas after coming from a 50% Asian infested area in LA didn't exactly rate high on my desireability meter, but OMG...take one bite of this magical\/ what did they put into this\/ if it's crack I'll still eat it- concoction changed my mind. 

The outside of this place makes it look like a hole in the wall. Definitely not the glitz and glamour that you're looking for, but enter and the walls are lined with awards and thai-style decor.

We were overwhelmed by all the food and spent about twenty minutes badgering the waiter about what was good. 

Laos Papaya Salad- Not to be eaten if you don't like spicy food. I love spicy food. The more it burns, the better it tastes, even though I probably won't be able to taste afterward. Point in case? It was good. But if you can't handle really spicy, it probably isn't for you. Or ask them to make it a level 2 spicy (medium). 

Garlic Prawns- I love garlic. I love prawns. I love Lotus of Siam. Therefore, I love Lotus of Siam's Garlic Prawns. They don't skimp out on the prawns, the flavor is explosive. I believe it's fried, so it's crispy on the outside, probably not the best thing for your waistline, but wonderfulness in a bite is not good for your waistline. 

And finally...

DRUNKEN NOODLE!!! 
I don't know why they call it drunken noodle, maybe it's hangover food? Maybe there's alcohol in it? Maybe you're supposed to be drunk while you eat it? I don't care...sober, drunk, about to die, I love this stuff. It looks like your typical Pan-Fried noodle, but looks are not to be deceiving of this mouth-watering concoction. It's extremely tasty, balanced, and a sensible portion, although with the 6 of us it was a fight for every last bit of noodle on that plate. I am now on the quest to try every Drunken Noodle in the LA area, but have yet to find anything remotely close. 

Oh Lotus of Siam, why must you be so far? That's right people, at 25 years old, the idea of partying and getting drunk on the strip are lower on the list of priorities. Number one? Eat Lotus of Siam.",1,1,0

Since I don't usually eat Thai, I don't really know what to look for or order or how good Thai is supposed to taste versus bad Thai.  

Went here with reservations and after about a 10 minute wait was seated.  The server was very attentive and knowledgeable and helped us in explaining what was popular and what other items were.  It just so happened the most popular dishes were the most expensive dishes.  Unfortunately we didn't get any of those but did order 4 other dishes and some wine.  The wine was really good and paired well with the food.  The food was good but not anything I would really write home about.  That may be because I'm not used to the flavors but I just thought most of it was eh.  It wasn't bad, just not amazing.  We ordered some kind of sausage which had a spicy, just alright flavor but seemed dry, a spicy and sour soup which was at the same time one of the spiciest and one of the most sour food II have ever eaten, which was very interesting, a green curry, chicken vermicelli which was good but seemed a bit bland as well, and then a roasted pork stew over rice which was great although came in a very small portion.

We arrived about 30 minutes after the start of dinner service on a weekend with no reservation, and although there was already a line of people waiting for tables, we didn't have to wait long (Maybe 5-10 minutes).

The menu is quite extensive, and spans various regions of Thailand. The alcohol list is also equally as extensive, for those that choose to have some with their meal. After reading the great reviews about the drunken noodles, I decided on the seafood drunken noodles ($13). I had other people in my party get chicken pad Thai and chicken panang. 

The drunken noodles came in a flavorful brown sauce, cooked well. I wasn't too impressed with the seafood mixture though. It looked like it came out of one of those cheaper seafood mixes you get in the freezer section at the Asian grocery store. It had pre-cut slices of calamari, scallops, mussels, and imitation crab. The seafood itself tasted just OK. The calamari did taste a little tough though. 

I asked for the dish ""medium"" spice level, and I thought it was spot-on. It was spicy enough to give you some kick to your meal, but mild enough that you won't be drowning yourself in gallons of water to cool off from the heat. The person that had the chicken pad Thai was very satisfied with her meal, and the person that had the chicken panang thought it was good, albeit also a little pricy for what he got.

Service was excellent despite it being very busy. Plates were taken as needed and drinks were refilled fairly promptly.

For a Monday lunch it was surprisingly busy.  The walls were covered with awards and pics of celebrities.

I did a little research and made sure to order what they are known for- the Garlic Prawns and the Crispy Duck Curry.  Both dishes were delicious.
The Garlic Prawns are deep fried with their shells and sautéed with a flavorful garlic seasoning\/sauce.  The shells are meant to be eaten but after a while you will realize you're eating shells.  The duck curry was also very tasty and had a nice crisp.  One caveat - the portion was a bit small.

Inside you'll find friendly service and a hodgepodge of Vegas' real movers and shakers.  If you want tool-academy rejects and busboy-pimps, head to the Palms and Tryst and Tao.  The Vegas pols and artists and hipsters and foodies head to Lotus to Thai one on without breaking the bank.

We found out about this place and decided to try it out because Anthony Bourdain dined there once before with Jet Tila on Parts Unknown. Lol 

So far we've tried..

Garlic Prawns $27.95 -fried to perfection! It's so crispy that you can eat the shell and tail whole. (Bf's fav!) 

Chilean Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles $30.95
Fried Soft Shell Crab with Drunken Noodles $22.95
-small portion of delicious noodles but they're perfectly chewy! Both the deep fried chilean sea bass and soft shell crab are amazing! Neither would disappoint. 

Crispy Duck with Panang $27.95 -Amazing! Tender pieces of duck with a light crispy coating on thai style red cream curry sauce with cognac. 

..and the forgettable dishes.. 

Tom Kah Kai Soup $10.95 -sliced chicken with coconut milk, straw mushrooms, galanga, lemongrass and lime juice. Omg..it was soooo sour. We had to ask the waiter to take it back to make it less sour. : \/

Nam Prik Ong ""chili dip"" $11.95 -one of the least spicy northern chili dips..it's actually not spicy at all! It has ground pork, tomato, and dried spices. It reminds me of meat sauce..and it comes with a small assortment of veggies and fried pork skins to dip. (Jet Tila ordered this..meh. Lol)

Nam Kao Tod $8.95 -this was okay..I've had better nam kao in Oakland. 

Their menu is verrry extensive! Everything we ordered was that was delicious was mostly in the ""Chef's Choice"" section. Stick to those dishes and you won't be disappointed! I highly recommend the crispy duck panang, soft shell crab or Chilean sea bass drunken noodles and garlic prawns. 

Lotus of Siam is a must whenever we come to Vegas! Worth the short uber ride off the strip. :)",22,26,18

I have been here 5 times so far and neither I nor my date have ever gotten anything we didn't like. The last time we were here I got green curry and he got panang curry (not the one with crispy duck, although we have gotten that before and it was excellent). We both liked the panang curry better but the green curry was delicious as well.

Usually we also get the pork jerky or the beef jerky as an appetizer. The pork jerky is extremely juicy, the beef jerky is full of flavor, and both come with a fantastic sauce. My favorite thing on the menu is Tom Kah Kai soup, it is just the best thing on this planet. We haven't been brave enough to try the stranger things on the menu, but the menu is so extensive that it doesn't matter. If you don't know what to try, the staff are extremely helpful!

We usually order our food at a 2 or 3 which is spicy enough to make my eyes water a bit but not so spicy that I can't taste the subtler flavors. 

In another review someone complained about only getting one bowl of rice. They do only give one bowl initially--that is so everyone at the table can take some and it's not just sitting there forever getting cold. If you ask for more rice they will give you as much as you want at no extra charge and it will be out about a minute after you request more (edit: apparently they charged for extra for the other reviewer--I don't know if they forget to charge me, don't charge because we are there often, or what).

 I have also seen a few people say that the portions are small. While I personally have always left Lotus full (and sometimes even with leftovers), it is true that the portions are smaller than at your average ten-pound-plate American restaurant. The intended way to eat (at least for the curry and saucy dishes) is that you use the rice to soak up the sauce--and since the sauce is delicious and the rice is unlimited, that is how you fill up if you are still hungry.

The pricing is extremely reasonable. Usually our bill runs about 50$ total--that is INCLUDING tax, tip, appetizer, two entrees, and drinks, and it's easy to keep it under 35$ for two people if you want. I would say this is the most underpriced restaurant in Vegas.",0,0,1

We were looking forward to an amazing meal but didn't have a single dish that deserved more than two stars. 

Tom Yum soup had too much tamarind flavor. 
Roast duck curry was too watery and had grapes in it which was a surprising first if only it tasted good. 
Thai sausage was cold and lacked flavor. 
Papaya salad had really thick strands of papaya that didn't soak up enough flavor. 
Drunken noodle with soft shell crab was bland and the noodles all stuck together.

This is one of the best Thai restaurants in the USA. Authentic and delicious. The place was buzzing and overly busy during Project trade show. 

Started with Sigha beer then Chang beer waiting for 1.5 hours for a table. Worth the wait yes.

The Northern Thai dishes are incredible. (This is their speciality).

Started with Tod Mun Plar - fried fish cakes and they are yummy. Also spicy chicken wings which are some of the spiciest I have had in a while and delicious too!

Then comes the Tom Yum Koong soup - hot and sour shrimp soup with lime and lemongrass also amazing.

For entree I had issan style grilled pork sausage with chili and peanuts, one of my go to dishes when it's on the menu in any Thai place. Nua yum Katiem was outstanding, this dish is sliced beef served with cabbage tangy sauce and smothered with fresh garlic, drool worthy!

I've read a lot that this is the 'best Thai resto in the USA' and I'm really not sure.  I can't say I know everything about Thai food, but it's one of my favourite cuisines and I've been to Thailand in the last few months to know really good Thai food. 

We went with a group of five so we were able to order a bunch of dishes and share family style.  We started off with a hot pot of tom kah kai soup ($15) which was nice.  It was lemongrass-y with mushrooms and chicken in it.  Nice start to lunch.  Aside from the soup we ordered pad thai ($11), papaya salad ($9), crispy duck penang ($23), and garlic prawns ($24), and thai iced tea for me ($2.50).

The superstar of the afternoon was definitely the crispy duck penang!  I will order it again and again every time in the future.  The portion was not huge for a $23 dish but definitely worth it in flavours.  I could eat the sauce it comes with, with anything.  Second superstar were the garlic prawns.  A big platter of butterfly'd prawns that were extra crispy with lots of super goodness to it!!

I know pad thai is pad thai - everyone orders it at a Thai resto and probably shouldn't be ordered in an 'authentic' place like this.  We should have listened.  I didn't like the pad thai and thought it was too tomato-y for me.  The papaya salad was nothing special either - was pretty basic.  It was also made a little too spicy for our mild request.  The thai iced tea was spot on though!!  Tasted just like the ones I ordered off the streets in Bangkok!

I would give this place 3\/5 because I literally just had some amazing food in Thailand a couple months ago so my standard is pretty high, and half of the stuff I wouldn't order again.  But service was pretty good, there was no line-up when we went for lunch on a Friday afternoon, and I really loooove a good thai iced tea.  I'll be back.",2,3,2

Lotus of Siam offers an exceptional variety of food. Beef jerky is always a winner for me as an appetizer. I also like the spicy crispy rice and the bacon-wrapped shrimp that are deep fried. (See my photos).
Tom ka gai is a chicken coconut soup they do so well. The way I get it normally in restaurants is that they cook the mushrooms in the soup. At Lotus of Siam they add fresh mushrooms right before they serve it. THat's a different way to do it and I like it. Also, if you look at my picture, you'll see a nice dose of chili sauce floating on top of the soup. Be forewarned about eating that straight. Make sure you mix up your soup before you eat it.
The duck dishes are usually pretty good at Lotus of Siam as well.

Sea bass drunken noodles - if you like chow fun, you will enjoy every bite of this phenomenal dish! Order it medium spicy and top it with the buttery sea bass and you'll be good to go! Satisfaction guaranteed!

Crispy duck - served with a coconut panang curry sauce, I was blown away by the incredible texture and zesty tang of the panang curry, awesomely delicious!

Garlic prawns - jumbo prawns served nice and crispy with the most enticing aroma I've experienced in years. It will make you drool at first whiff and the explosive garlicky flavor will keep you pining for another decadent bite!

Overall, awesome service, impeccable food and good times = A+++ from this guy

Our experience fell very short of our expectations. We kept hearing people talk about this place, they must not know what a great Thai food is! 

We met our friends at the bar upon arriving. The restaurant was packed in the waiting area which was very very small. Our friends were waiting at the bar so we joined them. The bartender lady handed the menu and the entire time we were there (a good 20minutes) never turned around and asked for our drink orders. Poor first impression!

We ordered a bunch of food to share on the table. I am a big seafood person and prior to going in, I checked Yelp for the ""must order"" items. I ordered the garlic prawns that everyone is raving about. It was average, nothing amazing. Honestly, I still prefer and love Pho Kim Long's salt and pepper shrimp! More flavorful and half the price!  

We paid our bill and was finishing our drinks. The server kept coming back and asking if we needed anything else and we said no. Not long after, the lady bartender who ignored us at the bar came to our table and asked us if it's ok if we leave cause people are waiting for our table. Really??? We work in the service industry here in Vegas for a long time. Never ever have I experienced being asked to leave! This place is over rated, will never come back again!

When we drove into the shopping center, we were wondering what we had gotten ourselves into. It was located in a strip mall which looked pretty deserted. We had also looked up Komol, which is right across from Lotus of Siam, but were intrigued by the reviews of this place. The place is not impressive looking from the outside, but when you step inside...totally different! We happened to come by when Las Vegas Magazine was there doing a review, which was pretty cool to see. I ordered the vegetarian Tom Yum (spicy vegetable soup) which was good! It's rare to find this in a cup size, so I was eager to try it. My friend and I both ordered the Vegetarian Drunken Noodle, which isn't on the menu, but asked that it be made as I am a vegetarian. I mentioned to the waiter that we had read awesome reviews from yelp and that we were from California. A few minutes later, an appetizer comes to our table...compliments of the manager. It was the veggie version of their ""Nam Kao Tod"" and it had tofu in it instead. The flavor was amazing, the lime juice brought out the flavors in the dish so well! Then, the manager brought over 2 glasses of wine to taste with the appetizer and he paired them nicely! When the main dish arrived (Veggie Drunken Noodle), I was practically full already. The dish had amazing color to it (please see my pic's of this dish in the photos above) with lots of tofu, FRESH veggies, and noodles. It was the BEST drunken noodle dish I've ever tasted. The service at this place was OUTSTANDING and we also noticed that the people dining behind us received the same service as well. We opted for the Sticky rice and coconut ice cream for dessert. OMG!!! My mouth is watering thinking about this delicious dessert. The coconut was so soft and young, and the rice was the perfect addition to compliment this. Again, 2 more glasses of wine appear and this time, it's my absolute favorite dessert wine, Muscato d'Asti. When the bill came, NO charge for the appetizer or the wine! The manager came over to our table and was incredibly gracious and a true gentleman. When we walked outside, he ran after us to make sure we weren't going to be hailing a cab, as the location is pretty remote and no cab's were in sight. We had a rental car, so we were set. Talk about going that extra mile! When we asked him how his competition was across the way (Komol is another Thai restaurant in the same lot), not one bad thing came out of his mouth and he said ""No, we don't compete with other restaurants, we like that we're a small place."" How cool was that? My friend and I vowed that every time we go to Vegas, we will definitely come back to this gem of a place. For anyone who loves Thai, ya gotta check it out when you're in Vegas. Thanks for a great lunch Lotus of Siam!!!!!

I don't know the name but one was Thai style and the other was Laos style? Regardless, both not good. One of them had some type of ocean critter and it was so salty, it was like eating right out of the ocean. But whatever that ocean critter was, I never want to eat it again. Justnotmything. The garlic prawns would have been good but waytoosalty. Finally, the yum woon sen salad took forever and also way too salty. They never refilled the hot tea.

FOOD
I enjoyed the fish cake, but it was a little on the saltier side for me. The chili sauce it comes with paired well. The garlic prawns were good and crispy (nice texture), I think they're known for their shrimps mostly. The papaya salad (my favorite Thai dish) was disappointing. The flavor was not what I was used to and there was so much sauce which made it liquidly. The coconut tom yum with chicken was good.

This place is a must for Thai food lovers visiting Vegas. It is a bit off the strip, but, worth the drive. And you'll likely have to wait a while unless you were lucky to get through ahead of time to make a reservation. The cab drivers will also vouch for the popularity and demand of this place. 

We had the usual Pad Thai and Papaya Salad for appetizers. The grilled shrimp, green, red, and yellow curries are all good. The squid salad is excellent. The basil and garlic eggplant dish is excellent. You can substitute green beans if you're not a fan of eggplant. If you like your food spicy and your guests do not, make sure to ask for the fish sauce and fresh Thai bird chillies. That gives it a nice kick. Just be careful, it can make a grown man cry. One if our guests tried some and had tears run down his face as he grabbed for the Chang beer. 

Chang beer is the best pairing for Thai food - IMHO. They have a huge wine cellar and it sure looks impressive behind the glass room. However, I just can't seem to muster up the taste buds to pair this amazing Thai food with wine. 

I have been to this restaurant several times before. Finally making the time to recognize this place for the fine food it produces. I've turned a few business clients on to this place.

My friends and I decided to grab takeout due to the long wait and we ordered the crispy duck curry and the drunken noodles.

First off, we had originally ordered the regular duck curry, but the lady told us that we should get the crispy duck because it was what the restaurant was known for. Given that the price of the crispy duck was more than double the price of the regular, she assured us that the portion of crispy duck was much larger and enough for 3. Thus, we decided to pay $28. She told us the wait would be 25 min.

We ended up waiting much more than an hour for takeout. Upon finally getting our food and opening the boxes, we found in the large takeout box, only 11 thin pieces of crispy duck, a carton of curry, and a small box of rice. For $28, it was simply a RIP-OFF. Don't get me wrong, the food was decent, but completely not worth the price. And we felt cheated.

So we went for a leisurely lunch at around 11:40am Friday.  Business was just starting to ramp up.  We were seated at a tiny two-top...BOO...which I always hate especially when I see other parties of two sitting at 4-tops.  Not conducive to us ordering so many dishes...

We started with the papaya salad and pork larb (my must-have at any Thai place).  The dressing for the papaya salad was a little too sweet for my taste, and my fork got all sticky.  The larb was an excellent version.  Both portions were very skimpy.

For entrees, we ordered what most people on Yelp recommended - the crispy duck panang and garlic prawns.  We also got the Thai fried rice w\/ beef.  The garlic prawns, I have to say, were amazing.  I expected them to be like the Chinese version, deep fried with scallions and peppers on top.  However, these were a step above...with the shell still attached and well-deep fried so you can munch on it separately from the shrimp itself.  Great flavor.

I have to say that while the crispy duck panang was delicious, the dish was kind of a let-down.  When I saw crispy duck, I thought maybe it was the roasted version with crispy skin...mmm.  However, this version turned out to be breaded and deep fried.  The breading was a little thick, especially when some of the pieces were smaller and you were eating mostly breading.  Not sure if this was worth the $28 price tag.  The garlic prawn definitely was.

Thai fried rice was tasty but I can't say if it was better than any other version I've had.

Service was actually pretty good except when the servers, even when faced with the Tetris challenge of finding space on our tiny table for all our food, opted to place the dishes in awkward spots like at our elbows rather than move us to a bigger table (of which many were available).  Waters were refilled and people were generally smiley.

The force (of hype) is strong with this one, and while it's almost always a good meal when I visit, it also almost always fails to meet my lofty expectations.  Is that something to hold against a restaurant?   If it's supposed to be one of the best in Las Vegas but turns out to just be yet another great Thai restaurant?  Maybe I should just get to the point and start talking about the food:

Been here several times, and almost each time I tried something different because unlike several people I know I AM NOT A SLAVE TO PARTICULAR DISHES.  Here's a list of what I can remember having and thoughts on each.  None of the appetizers I've had (Koong Sarong, prawns wrapped in bacon and deep fried \/ Mee Krob - crispy noodles with chicken and shrimp \/  Nam Kao Tod - see all other reviews ) have blown my mind, but all were decent.  I don't really get the hoopla over the Nam Kao Tod.  Have none of ya'll ever had rice krispies before or something?   

I've done a few of the soups and those were good.   Be careful on ordering those with heavy spice.  I swear one time I asked for a 5 \/10 on some Tom Yum Kung and nearly passed out from dehydration after 3 sips.  Another time I got the Seafood Soup at a 7\/10 and barely touched my water.  SHRUG.   Taste was fine on both, nothing to put it above and beyond any other Thai restaurants I've had.

Salads I've tried include the Spicy Squid Salad (VERY hot @  7\/10), and I liked that one a lot.  One thing I'll say is the ingredients always seem fresh which stands out in uncooked dishes like the salads.  I absolutely disliked the Spicy Shrimp Salad.  Whatever makes up their ""secret sauce"" simply has a flavor I do not enjoy, and it was DRENCHED with this.  No more secrets for me Saipin!  I'm onto you.  I also have had the Catfish Salad and Soft Shell Crab Salad.   Both of these were good, but ultimately not worth the cost.   One thing I should note is that I generally HATE salads, so maybe I should stop ordering them and talking about them in reviews.

For standard entrees I've mostly stuck with their Curries and have never been disappointed in any of them.   None have been made me completely forgo the competition around Las Vegas but they certainly rank among the best I've had.

At this rate all I've described would normally lead me to give a place a 3, but what makes me give it an end result of 4 is one thing and one thing only:  SEA BASS WITH DRUNKEN NOODLES.   FFS it's $29 but it's worth every penny and then some.  Just a spectacular dish that alone is worth 5 stars and would make me bump any review up a star.   Yes even the Post Office on Pebble and Bermuda.",4,3,4

For starters, we ordered the Tom Kah Kai and it was definitely a different take on a typical Tom yum soup. It was creamy from the coconut juice with just enough of tart and spiciness to compliment the abundance of chicken, mushrooms, and galanga. It was a great way to start off the meal.

For the appetizer, we ordered the Som Thum (papaya salad) and when asked if we wanted mild, medium, or spicy, we ordered medium. OMG, I am part Thai and I couldn't even take the spiciness. I tried to get seconds, but my friend was able to eat her seconds and my seconds. It was way too spicy for me. If you love hot and spicy, then you won't be disappointed. Before the heat kicked in, I really enjoyed the flavor. Three full glasses of ice water later and I was able to finally taste the next dish.

For the main course, we ordered the yellow chicken curry. This was among the top 10% of the yellow chicken curry dishes that I have ordered at other Thai restaurants. It was as good as my Dad and Mom would make. With rice, it definitely qualified as yummylicious.

If you don't just ask the waiter.  I've made that mistake once or twice and paid for it dearly during the meal.  Beyond that, most of the food here you can't go wrong with.  Try something new if it sounds good and generally it'll be amazing.

I've been here about a dozen times now and the tom kha soup is what keeps me coming back.  Absolutely amazing.   Having said that, usually we'll order 4 or 5 dishes and chow down, it seems that all the chefs there aren't exactly cooking the same meals consistently.  We'll LOVE a dish one night, try it again on the next visit and ... well... just isn't the same.  It's still good, just not mind-blowing *shruggs* can't win them all.

If you know you are planning on trying here, MAKE RESERVATIONS, if you are trying to get in last minute at dinner time, try showing up 15\/20\/30min before they open.  The line usually will already be forming at the time but I've had good luck getting in that way.

3. Chu Chee Shrimp - Oh my goodness NOM! This was similar to a Red Curry but was super fresh and light tasting. 

4. Kao Soi - I'm not in to soupy noodles, but my friend ordered this. His mom was raised in Thailand and he has had the dish at home and in Thailand many times. He thoroughly enjoyed it!

5. Thai Iced Tea - this was fine, though I would've preferred a stronger tea flavor (it was a little bland due to too much milk)

I drove my rented minivan to the strip mall (yes, you read that right a minivan. Me. In a minivan. Oh, and the strip mall too... and no, there weren't strippers at the strip mall) on Sahara. As I hustled to the door (it was very cold!) the small, completely unassuming store front seemed quiet for a Wednesday night. And then I opened the door. 

The place was positively cavernous, given the little entryway. I put my name down and went to sit at the bar while I waited the estimated 30 minute wait (it was less!). The bustle of the place is amazing. The smells, the service... there's a great energy and an extensive list of beers and wines to get you started. 

Earlier in the night DH had told me to ask if they had a tasting menu (they don't, but what a great idea!) so that I could try more things. It was only by the stroke of luck that my neighbours at the bar and I shared a similar last name, country of origin, and is turns out, passion for food. When we were seated next to eachother, they ever so graciously shared their appetizer (heaven on a plate) and I shared my tom ka kai (holy crap was that good).  The Ginger Sea Bass was perfectly delicate. You'd expect the thai flavours to overwhelm the fish, but instead it was perfectly balanced and prepared, with the fish still having just the right bite.

I'm a Pad Kee Mao aficionado. I eat it everywhere I can because it's my favorite and I'm always looking for the most amazing one.

Great crunch on the skin and the curry had a reasonable kick to it- loaded with flavor. Both of these dishes I would no doubt get again. The beef dish- while the beef was cooked nicely was not a favorite of mine. It was doused in something that resembled BBQ sauce that I wasn't a huge fan of (and notice how I said doused, they probably put too much on the meat).

All in all, it was a delicious meal. It is on the pricier side for lunch but, I personally think it is worth every penny. Don't be shy and ask for more rice if you need something to soak up all that curry. Truly a 5 star for me!",3,2,1

But don't let the surroundings fool you.  The food here is excellent.  Saipin Chutima was nominated for best chef in the Southwest Region by the James Beard Foundation in 2008.

The classic Pad Thai is a great rendition.  The noodles aren't overcooked, and the sauce is subtle enough to let the flavor of each ingredient shine through.

The Sua Rong Hai (charbroiled beef) is a great dish.  Tender, flavorful slices of perfectly cooked beef come with sauce that is somewhat on the spicy side, but not overly so.  The sauce compliments the beef perfectly, instead of overpowering it.

The Nam-Prik-Noom (Green chili dip) comes with an assortment of vegetables along with fried pork rinds.  Although flavorful, this wasn't as spicy as I was expecting.  A little more heat would have brought an extra dimension to this dish.

The Musaman Curry is unlike anything I have ever had before.  If you are a fan of Satay and enjoy the peanut sauce that comes along with it, you will absolutely love this dish.  It is like a curried version of the peanut sauce, with roasted peanuts, potatoes, carrots, and chicken.  This is a little on the sweet side, but not cloyingly so.

The Thai Beef Salad was the best thing I had on the night.  Although relatively simple, the salad was just bursting with flavor.  An explosion of lime juice, fish sauce, and heat make every bite leaving you wanting more.  The beef is very tender and juicy.

Average food at best.  Insanely large menu and confusing,

I am not sure where all of the five star reviews come from.  

We introduced ourselves to the hostess\/waitress for a party of two and we were told thirty minutes.  That's ok, I understand, but after waiting in the tiny lobby in the way off all incoming and outgoing traffic we were seated.  While walking to our table i noticed a large bar area that we could have enjoyed a drink while waiting.  She never mentioned it to us and we could not see it from where we were waiting.

The first turn off was the size of the menu. (over 100 items) Any time I see menus with multiple pages I know there is no way any kitchen can keep that many items in house, fresh and cooked properly.

We ordered fried won tons and tom kha gai soup for starters.  The won tons were nice but the soup was thin, broken and separated oil lie on the surface.  not sure if it were overheated or on a steam table too long???

Our entrees were pineapple duck curry and seared scallops.  After 10 minutes the waiter (nice guy) informed me the kitchen was out of scallops.  I ordered red curry as a substitute. Both dishes were ok,  nothing memorable but hot and served with steamed rice.  I have no negatives about the entrees but considering all of the reviews i was hoping for WOW.  

to sum up the negatives; 
hostess process
buss tubs being used at the tables
buss carts and dirty dishes line the tight hallway to the restrooms.
pan handlers in the parking lot.

There is nothing special about this place, inside and out. After reading so much about it, and hearing Andrew Zimmern rave about this place, it was on top of my list for my last Vegas trip. It goes to show, all of the top restaurants aren't inside the popular casinos and resorts. Most of them are all commercialized and owned by restaurant groups. Lotus of Siam is one of one. It makes it unique and special, and is a part of Vegas as much as any of the popular resorts.

We started things off with something exciting and new. The Koong char num plar, raw prawns marinated in seasoned fish sauce was a favorite of ours. With the spicy fish sauce, fresh garlic and roasted chili paste, the dish definitely had flavor. Ironically, I used a bunch of that fish sauce to get rid of the rawness and ""fishy"" flavor. Spiciness met sweetness from the shrimp. The texture of this was spectacular. A bit on the sticky side, the texture took some getting used to. Still a great way to start.

My personal favorite was the Nam Kao Tod. It was a crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. Texturally different from the raw shrimp, this had a nice crunch, and the crunch played a great role in this dish. The ginger flavor popped and the citrus was key. It was delicious and refreshing.

The dish of all dishes-the one to get here always Is the Drunken Noodle Prawn. Thick rice noodles are on fried with deep fried prawns. The shell I kept on and the frying process makes the skins edible. The special blend of garlic sauce and Thai basil was perfect. The prawns were cooked perfectly and the crunch of the skin was amazing. This dish is pretty hard to pass up -- a definite must order here.

To end everything, we ordered the coconut ice cream with sticky rice. It was a great neutralizer form all that garlic, shrimp, and spices. The coconut flavor was mild and not too overpowering. My favorite was the sticky rice. Everything just had such a delicate flavor and nothing was overbearing.

Back home in Los Angeles, there are a bunch of Ktown style Chinese restaurants that have pretty good food. From spicy seafood noodles to fried pork and beef dishes, they are all delicious, but you won't find any of these in China. The menu hasn't changed ever since the first time I went, and that is the quality of the places. You know what you will get, and its the same no matter when you go. Lotus of Siam is kind of like that. The menu hasn't changed in forever, and the food, though may not be genuine Thai renditions is delicious.",3,1,1

I ordered the beef combo soup since I opted out of the AYCE buffet for $10.99 The soup took half an hour to receive after ordering and was disappointing. I ordered 4 on the spice level and the taste was flat and the temperature was lukewarm. In addition, the menu stated it contained flat noodles which wasn't served and the portion was small. For the price they charge, the soup wasn't worth $8.95

This place is just as good as any restaurant I've been to in Bangkok and I only wished I lived close enough to visit Lotus of Siam on a regular basis.

Don't be turned off by the shady strip mall location.  Uber\/Cabs will be pulling up one after the other and once you open the door, you'll see how packed and large the restaurant is.

Hands down my favorite was the Crispy Duck with Penang Curry. This was sooo good, we ordered 2 plates.  Before doing so, I asked the waiter if there was anything comparable and he said the duck curry is in an entirely different league and he was right. I only wished they provide double the amount of curry so that I can soak my rice in it and lick the plate twice!  I'll definitely be dreaming about this dish for years to come as its probably one of my favorite plates of all time. It deserves every single accolade.

With that in mind, I also tried the popular Garlic Shrimp and was sorely disappointed.  This tasted similar to seafood dishes at cantonese restaurants and was a tad too greasy.

However I LOVED the crispy rice with sausage. Every individual rice morsel was light and crispy. I just don't know how they do it but I'll def be ordering again.

The Thum Ka Noon was a total surprise. I didn't expect the dish to taste the way it did but it was delicious and the tastiness grows with every bite.  

We ended the meal with Mango Sticky Rice and Coconut Ice Cream.  Perfectly ripe and transported me right back to Thailand

One additional note - we ordered a 5 in spiciness.  I don't like the burn your tongue spiciness but I certainly the spice level could have been kicked up a notch and will probably order a 7 or 8 next time around.

One thing I really like about this place is that the menu has Northern style cuisine. I actually have never tried Northern style Thai so it was a really cool change of pace. 

A big tip is that this place gets packed during busy hours. I came once for lunch and there was about 1-130 hr wait so I had to eat somewhere else. There was no way I was going to wait an hour for lunch. The second time I came, I came after dinner time around 900 and we still had to wait about 15 mins to be seated. The third time, I made reservations around 530 and had no problems getting a table.

The service is good. When it's not too busy the waiters will be on point. But when it starts getting busier, you realize that you don't exactly have a certain waiter assigned to you and it's pretty much a free for all. The more packed it is, the less good service you'll receive. When I came around 530 when it was empty, the waiters were really fast on our demands. But by the time it was hitting 700, it was hard to track down our waiter bc he was off running somewhere else.

We ordered an array of food. Drunken noodles with sea bass and soft shell crab, garlic prawns, panang curry with crispy duck, mussels and beef satay. All were okay. Nothing spectacular of sort. The drunken noodles were really OILY!! I have no idea why people keep raving about it but it's so doused with sauce and the noodles get soggy. The noodles break apart easily that whenever you pick it up with chopsticks you can't get a good bite. The garlic prawns were okay. I really like the crispness but I expected more garlic. Did not have a hint of garlic to it. My favorite was the panang curry with crispy duck. The duck was super crispy even when soaked in curry and the panang curry is sooo good!! The only downside to this dish is that they give you TOO LITTLE CURRY compared to the amount of duck!!!

Overall, this place is good. I don't think it's spectacular as some people rave it to be. Its not really authentic too bc I've had some authentic Thai and it tastes better. Other than that it's a good spot to know if you're craving Thai.",5,0,2

Everyone says to get the Northern Thai dishes at LOS.  So we tried a few things:

Khao Soi $10.95 - egg noodle curry soup.  We thought it was just ok, nothing special.
Some red onions, pickles, lime on the side.

Kang Hung Lay $10.95 - red pork curry.  It was a small dish of just pork and curry sauce w\/ some cilantro on top.  Tasted just ok, nothing special.

Northern Tom Kah Soup $10.95 - a bit spicy and sour without coconut milk soup, chicken is dry, some grape tomatoes flavorless, some mushroom, meh.

Sticky rice $2 - for 1 person, meh, dry.

Thai ice tea $2.5 - very sweet!  Had to dilute it with lots of water & ice.

Hot tea $2 - some container of hot tea w\/ tea bag, nothing special.

They offer a lunch buffet, but I think you have to order off the menu if you want the good stuff.  The Chef Specials are a little pricy but are also what make Lotus so special.  I highly recommend the:

-GARLIC PRAWNS ($21.95)
More of an appetizer, but these whole prawns are fried until crispy and have great garlicky salty flavor.  You can eat the shell!

-KHAO SOI SHORT RIBS (19.95)
Very tender short ribs served over noodles in a very addictive Panang (I think it's Panang) sauce.  The sauce tastes amazing over rice as well.

-DRUNKEN NOODLES with CRIPSY DUCK (21.95).
My friends thought the duck was a little too spicy, but I thought it was very good.  The crispy skin reminds me of Peking duck.  I wasn't that impressed by the noodles though.

Service was very friendly but also very slow, especially after we got our food.  We didn't see our waiter again until we had to flag him down to get our check.

Garlic prawns $21.95

I did though take out some of unrendered fat bits out. The Garlic prawns were pretty tasty. You could eat the shells which was plus. It was a little on the greasy side so the extra napkins surely helped. The soup was good but not something I would order again. Overall I would say that Lotus of Siam was a good experience.

Getting here may terrify some of you, especially at night. Like almost everything off the strip, Lotus resides in a strip mall. This one is particularly sparse and shady and is populated by folks who will solicit you for money.

Once you walk in through the doors, wow! Shiny! Especially that liquor and wine room! The walls are lined with photos of mama chef with various celebs. But, I'm here for the food, so let's have it.

Chicken larb, moo yang, rice and singha. I thought these would be a good indicator of the food here. The larb was good (although not spicy for a ""Medium Thai"" request). The moo yang was also good, with all the right aromas, flavors, and sauces. Did it blow me away? No. If I were in Vegas, would I come back? Yes.

My dad introduced me to this restaurant during our last trip to Vegas. The restaurant had a line outside of it even before it opened- proof that they're doing something right.

A few of the things we ordered-

Issan style beef jerky (delicious, not like the stuff in the bag at the gas station, but REAL, spicy beef jerky)
Panang short ribs (spicy and perfect, the best Panang sauce I've ever had)
Sea bass over drunken noodles (my favorite)
Fried banana and mango with sticky rice (must try- I didn't try the coconut ice cream but it looked delicious).

I tried the northern Thai dish with young jackfruit curry (I was trying dishes I hadn't seen before on menus); it was homestyle tasting and actually disappointingly bland.  I'm a jackfruit nut; I didn't really think that the young jackfruit would taste like canned artichoke hearts -- but they really did.  I was hoping for a pungent, sweet, spicy yellow curry I suppose (fresh ripe jackfruit).  My mistake.  I ordered this ""pretty hot"", though, and it came out very mild.

A James Beard nominated chef, I would love to come more often to find more of the ""hits"" on the menu like that beef & tendon soup (OMG).

Side note - Funny thing - i've been coming to this shopping complex for years to go to a few Korean restaurants, so I did feel like I was really going for Korean food instead of Thai.

Since a bunch of us were in town for Yelp Spring Break - we made it a point to have LOS on the list of to dos...(and then quite a few people set up UYEs...go figure) so we were there first thing for lunch on Friday.  There are no ""lunch specials"" but there is a $10.99 lunch buffet.  I guess it can't be vegas without a buffet?

I know that you don't exactly go to a Thai restaurant for chicken wings, but the garlic black pepper chicken wings caught my eye and I just couldn't let it go.  So chicken wings it is.

couldn't do it alone - so got some chicken dumplings as well with some steamed rice.  My bestie who joined me in town for Yelp Spring Break got the Yellow Curry so we did some sharing.

Curry was decent, but I felt that the veggies weren't really cooked enough.  I kinda felt like they just threw it in in the last 2 minutes to warm them and that was it.  Not that I was expecting mush, but a little bit more cooked perhaps?

Chicken dumplings were fried, nothing special, I'm sure I've gotten those before in the freezer section at the grocery store.

But the wings deserve 5 stars on their own.  They were so GOOD.  there was some sweetness to them, but the garlic and pepper were fantastic with the wings.  They were cooked (fried) to perfection and still moist enough on the inside.  Absolutely loved the flavor profile.  Go figure the truly non tradition item was the thing I thought was the best.  I'd go back for the wings, but don't know if I'd be willing to get other things...besides, the wings were like 9 bucks on their own for 6, which is a bit steep when you think about it.

Service was quite good, but be forewarned, if you are there with a large group, they can only split it four ways, so be a good customer and bring cash if you've got a large group, not a pile of debit cards.

I have to say I am super impressed with the dishes they have. 

We came here on our last day in Vegas before traveling to seattle and ordered the crab fried rice, tom kah kai soup, beef satay, and garlic shrimp. 

Beef satay: I've never had thai styled beef on skewers before but this was an epic way to start! the peanut sauce is just divine. 

Crab Fried Rice: Literally the best crab fried rice i've had in my life. There's way more chunks of crab vs. other chinese places where I've ordered the same dish. 

Tom Kah Kai: This didn't stick out to me much but it did still taste as great as any other thai place. 

Garlic Shrimp: My favorite thai restaurant makes this very differently, but Lotus of Siam's version is pretty bomb as well! This one's deep fried and not smothered in minced garlic and you can eat the shell as well!

Okay this will be a somewhat incomplete report. Not that I didn't have dinner there nor did I leave early. Nope. I had appetizer, salad, main course and dessert. So why the incomplete?

Well, with over 150 items (I can't remember the full count) there's a lot to try. With this first visit, we decided to go Thai lite. But not to worry dear Yelpers, I have more visits planned. Luckily, my sister teaches at the high school just down the street so I'll always have an excuse. 

So enough with the pleasantries. Time for the food goodness. To start, we had fried chicken dumplings. It was good though not entirely memorable. I liked eating it but I don't have to have it on my next visit. 

Also up for starters is the traditional Thai salad with peanut dressing. I don't need to say much about this except that my brother in law was slurping up the dressing and kept the bowl of dressing on the table after the salad greens were removed. (He later poured some on his steamed rice. Don't ask.)

For the main dishes, we went with pad Thai (good), sua rong hai (yummy grilled beef with a nice spicy sauce) and panang curry with chicken (my favorite out of the three). 

For dessert we had a rice pudding and fried banana roll. Both if these are very good. I especially enjoyed the banana roll with coconut sugar(?) wrapped in fried crispy wonton goodness. I could've eaten just the innards (good by their lonesome) if I wanted to save a few calories. But why bother living at all? So just shove it all in your mouth and swallow, calories be dammed. (Get your minds out of the gutter, but the double entendre is understandably apropos.) 

So nothing mind-blowingly exciting but good solid eating. I spent a lot of time looking at other tables' orders like the whole fried fish or battered shrimp that caught my eye. Yes, I had prawn envy. 

But I vow to return and try all the other goodies. If my first tastes are good enough to go back before the check has even arrived, then you know me likey.

Sea bass w drunken noodles: bomb sea bass. It was perfectly fried. It wasn't too breaded. The fish really held on its own. The noodles were spicy but not too spicy. 

Garlic prawns: they hooked it up. I mean I guess they should for the price. It was so crispy and tasty. I ate the heads whole. If you're not eating the head then you're missing out. Waste not, want not. 

Tom yum soup: they use fresh mushrooms. Other places will use canned mushrooms. It was good. My boyfriend was hungover and it got his stamp of approval. 

Nam Prik Ong: it was okay. I thought it was going to be better because it was on the food network. It reminded me of tomato sauce with pork. I was hoping it would be spicy, it wasn't. The chicharron was the best part.",2,1,1

I went there on a weeknight at 8:30pm, thinking I was late enough to be able to get in without waiting, but found out I had to wait FORTY FIVE MINUTES! That is how popular this place is. I ended up leaving and making a reservation for dinner 2 days later. If you want to eat here at dinner without a wait, you MUST call in advance!

Our waiter was extremely helpful in explaining the menu items, since nobody in my group was familiar with thai food. He was very patient and gave us helpful suggestions, and our water was always promptly filled. Thank goodness for that, because the food was HOT.

My group likes spicy food, so we asked for our dishes to be prepared to a 5, 7, and 8 on the 1-10 spiciness scale. IT. WAS. INTENSE. Hence my drinking 3 glasses of water, and thank goodness my waiter was prompt in refilling my water because I might've died otherwise. If you ask for a number higher than 5, know what you're getting into: A 10 would be practically nuclear. 

I can't recommend the fried catfish enough. It's one of their specialties, and for good reason. We ordered fried catfish with basil. The catfish pieces were so tender and flavorful, they tasted like a much more expensive fish. Any of the curries is also delicious. One dish I do not recommend is any of the dips. For $10, all you get is a plate of blanched vegetables (which are pretty fresh, to their credit) and a cold ""dip"" which is often more like a salad. But the other items we had more than made up for this miss. 

I always imagine dives like lotus of siam to have giant portions, but the servings here are small, rendering the restaurant more expensive than the menu prices would suggest. It's enough, but you probably won't have leftovers. 

All in all, this place truly impressed me. I've never had thai food better than this!",1,0,0

The crispy rice is more of a acquired taste...I like it but not for everyone as it is sour and salty but a good starter to encourage the appetite. The crispy prawns were amazing...my favorite part of this dish were the shells that had so much flavor. The crispy duck was the perfect level of spicy for me (I ordered 7 out of 10 and like things spicy) and the crispy part was super crispy and the moist parts were succulent all coated with a basil sauce that was to die for. Finally the short ribs in panang sauce was delicious. The sauce was flavorful and the meat tender.

I consider myself a Thai food fanatic- and had friends in Las Vegas who constantly were bragging that they had the ""best thai restaurant""...  Thinking I knew everything- I doubted them, and was proved wrong.

My first visit had me quite surprised when we walked into the storefront in a dilapidated strip mall to meet a huge glass wine cellar, world-class service, and killer food.

I had the Pad Thai on my first trip as that is always a safe bet... it was quite good- but the soups, and appetizers really blew me away.  My buddy ordered his favorite, the #58 which I tasted and immediately had bad food envy.  

My second trip I ordered this and it was as good as I had remembered.  On this trip, I brought my CEO, and several colleagues...  One of which being a major foodie.  They were all flabbergasted.

Location\/venue: It's located in a seriouly shady part of town in a mall I would never go to alone. The venue like...an old tired Chinese restaurant. 

Food: I was actually slightly disappointed that not everything was out of this world delicous...here's the breakdown
-Crispy duck with panang curry: This was hands down the star of our meal. It's one of their signature dishes and expectations were high...and they totally delivered. Duck was perfectly crispy and juicy and the curry! OH EM GEE SOOOOOO DELICIOUS. Perfectly balanced, creamy without being heavy. Good to the very last drop. We might as well have just licked the plate.
-Garlic prawns: Another signature dish that was very good, though not as amazing as the duck with panang curry. the shrimp meat and shell are fried separately, which surprisingly makes everything yummy crunchy and edible. The shells were possibly even better than the meat of the prawns. 
-Soft shell crab with drunken noodle: this was disapointing, especially after the first two dishes. The soft shell crab was a bit soggy and the noodles were super soggy. In fact the noodles were all stuck together in sticky soggy bricks. I feel like I must have gotten an anomaly.
-Sai Oua (norther style sausage): don't get this. it's just...a sausage. It wasn't special. I mean, if you know what it is and you like it, sure. But otherwise, it was super disappointing and just not very good.
-Fried banana with coconut ice cream: So crispy, so yummy, the banana and the coconut ice cream were perfect complements!
-Mango with sticky rice: Mango was beautifully deliciously silky ripe. sticky rice was  perfectly chewy and yummy. Both of the desserts were delicious. I was way beyond capacity full by dessert and I still finished every last bite of dessert!

If you come for the duck\/curry, prawns, and dessert, it's PERFECT. 5 starts. However, I am disappointed that aside from the two signature dishes the rest of the entrees were any good. Their menu is actually quite extensive...wonder if how much of the menu is actually at the level of their 2 signature dishes?",0,0,0

The place gets a healthy crowd, so reserve as soon as you decide to go. Dress is casual, though I saw a table of women ready to go clubbing all glammed up.

Their unassuming interior won't ""wow"" you (but you may notice the strong smell of Thai spices permeating the dining room). While you may not be shocked by the decor, the food WILL grab your attention. All of our appetizers and entrees were tasty and of a consistent quality. If we requested our dishes to be spicy, they came out spicy.

Shared many dishes (which explains why I don't have much detail for some of them) and dined family style:
- koong sarong (prawn in a blanket; $11) - wish we had more!
- moo dad deaw (deep fried marinated pork jerky; $8) - yum
- mussels - spicy and scrumptious
- salad with ginger, ground beef ($8) - I think it was the tod mun plar
- sour soup (served in its own cooker) (probably more than $10)
- calamari salad (not bad!)
- green curry (tasty, not overtly spicy)
- something that looked like an omelette
- a noodle dish that was drunken noodle-esque

Lotus of Siam was recommended by many folks, local and otherwise. They aren't the best Thai restaurant in the US, as claimed, but it sure comes close.

First night (Sunday) I tried to make a reservation and they told me after the waiting list gets long enough, they stop taking reservations - you better just show up and get on the list. So we tried again Monday. This time we showed up in person and got on the list. Not too hard to spot - if you're travelling eastbound on Sahara heading away from the Strip you'll eventually see the backside of a dingy mall and LOTUS OF SIAM quite visible on the wall on the south side of Sahara. You then make the next turn and find a parking spot in the mall close to the restaurant. Shouldn't be hard at night since most of the businesses are either closed or not anywhere near as busy as Lotus Of Siam. We had about an hour's wait and the waiting area only has a few chairs so we decided to venture the mall outside. The rest of the mall is mostly Korean bars or restaurants plus a few sketchy ""clubs."" None of the restaurants seemed to be ""hopping."" Lotus Of Siam probably had more people in it than all the surrounding businesses combined. There were lots of shuttered businesses - perhaps this was once a thriving Koreatown in Las Vegas but this mall's best days are definitely in the past. Maybe it's a lot more thriving during the day but walking around there at night gave me a kinda creepy vibe. So we circled the whole place and came back and were seated not long after. I guess some folks couldn't wait any longer and left as a few names the hostess called out did not produce any acknowledgement from the people still sitting and waiting. There were so many people in the restaurant that when we finally got seated almost elbow to elbow next to the people at the tables on either side it felt like we were in a crowded diner. Couldn't they just buy out one of the bigger empty lots around and expand? So anyway, we ordered the crispy duck in Panang curry, the crispy garlic prawns, and our squeamish pal ordered the Panang curry with chicken. The crispy duck was awesome. So were the prawns - you eat the whole thing - shell and all - as we were instructed by our waiter. The Panang curry with chicken was rather lackluster in comparison but that was pretty much eaten by our unadventurous buddy who won't eat seafood and for whom duck was too exotic. Based on the first two dishes I'd say this place lives up to the hype. Portions weren't overly huge and the price was a little steep but we left satisfied. We'll probably be back one day. I'll say it would probably be worthwhile to check this place out if you're actually quite familiar with Thai food.

After hearing a lot of great things about the dishes, we all took a bunch of cabs from the Strip to come into the side strip mall the restaurant was located. The decor inside was a little dated, but was relatively well-kept, and we were seated right away, as it was a weekday, on the later side of the lunch hour.

Our group had a lot of different types of diners, some adventurous and some not quite as adventurous, so it was good that the menu was very extensive, so that there was just about something for everyone, from fried rice and pad see ew, to more traditional Northern Thai dishes. I personally got the crispy duck penang, which was excellent. The fried bits held up really well in the curry, and the flavors with the rice made me want more and more curry. We also got the garlic prawns, and the Nam Prik Ong (chili dip). The prawns were really great and flavorful, although the chili dip was just okay to me. I liked the intense flavor of the dip, but the crudite it came with was a bit disappointing.

Service was fairly spotty throughout the meal, as we were constantly asking for drinks and water refills. To be fair, we were a large group, but on the other hand, the place wasn't particularly busy, as only a few other parties were in the restaurant. The prices were definitely on the expensive side for Thai food, but as some of us went for the more adventurous dishes to try, the bill was a little higher.

Would definitely recommend if you're trying to get off the Strip for a meal. There really is something for everyone, and the popular dishes are really something you should go for.",53,35,44

On to the food!! The food was well disappointing :( The chicken satay was good, but not ""oh wowey here go my taste buds"" good. My mom did say that they tasted exactly like the ones she had in Indonesia when she was young, so maybe it is more of an authentic taste and my Americanized taste buds didn't like it??? 

On to the panang curry!!

Facility:  Surprisingly nice.  Updated and some nice finishes.  In typical Thai restaurant fashion, a bit hodge podge, but it was clean.

This would have been a 4 star but there was a BIG BLACK HAIR in my food.  Ewwww.

If you've heard of the dish in Utah, don't order it. It will just be something you've had before, but better. Order things that are Northern Thai specialities we don't see here.

We always thinks about the Garlic Prawns (Chef's Choice).  Since this was an impromptu trip we didn't have a set plan for anything special, except to have Garlic Prawns.

When we reached our hotel we immediately called the restaurant only to find out they are completely booked this evening and tomorrow evening as well.

We came here with a large group so we tried several dishes.  First off, service is really great and friendly.  Our server made a lot of great suggestions and had no problem answering our questions about dishes.  We had the deep-fried garlic prawns, khao soi (curry noodle dish), sai oua (sausage), red and green chili dips, kang hung lay (beef stew), crispy duck with panang sauce, sea bass with ginger, pad thai, and some sticky rice.  

The prawns were superb, deep-fried but not greasy at all and the batter has some great seasoning.  For me the khao soi was the standout dish, everyone loved it and by the end of the meal people were spooning up the curry sauce to eat over rice because it was so good.  I also highly recommend the chili dips.  The green chili was my favorite and reminded me of Mexican green chili because it came with tiny little pork rinds to eat with it. The sai oua had a great flavor.  When you bring it up to your mouth to eat it, you can catch a whiff of the aromatics it's spiced with.  I also really enjoyed the crispy duck and the sea bass was perfectly cooked and tender.  I really enjoyed my meal here.  And dessert was fantastic as well. I highly suggest getting the combo desert plate which comes with crispy fried bananas (they look like fried spring rolls with banana inside instead of veggies) and coconut ice cream over sticky rice.  Heavenly.

If you come here and are overwhelmed by the expansive menu, I would highly recommend being adventurous and ordering mainly off the Northern Thai and Chef's Choice menus.  Parking is plentiful, and because there are quite a few bars and clubs in the immediate area, grabbing a cab back to the Strip is not very difficult.

I came after Christmas and the restaurant is half-opened.  The other half is sealed up with drywall, leaving very limited seating and long lines. 

At lunch #1: we ordered off the menu.  

DRUNKEN NOODLES with PRAWNS:  The prawns were fanastically fried, with the shells semi attached, which are like the best shrimp crackers ever.  They were so addictively well fried and well seasoned.  The noodles, however, were sooo meager in portion that it almost makes me angry.  I'd actually consider bartering with the chef.  I'll give her back a few prawns just for a few more noodles.  The dish is littered with fried, seasoned garlicy basil leaves.  Nothing is mixed though so it's a bit of a mystery how to eat this. 

PAD THAI:  Tiny little noodles and it makes your neighborhood Thai place embarrassed to use ketchup! 

NAM KAO TOD: Crispy rice with sour sausage seasoned with ginger, lime.  OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.  The flavors were so intense and funky.  With a bite of raw cabbage and cucumbers in between each bite of rice, this was my favorite dish of the day. 

LUNCH #2:  Lunch buffet.  Vegetarian pad thai, some kind of curry (e.g. red, yellow), vegetable tempura, some kind of soup (e.g. egg drop, hot and sour), fresh fruit, fried rice, white steamed rice, various stir fries, orange chicken.  Only order this if you're wanting huge portions of pad thai.  I did like the banana rolls for dessert.  Banana wrapped in egg roll wrappers along with some shredded coconut and deep fried.  

Mmm, next time I'll skip the buffet and order more adventurously off the menu.",1,0,1

The Food:
I can't think of an item\/entrée that I didn't like. The flavors are spot on and you can tell that they take pride in what they serve. The entrées are family style, so everyone in our party can enjoy the tastes. 

Here are some of my favorites (that i remember from the top of my head)
- Garlic Prawns
- Pad Thai
- Spicy Fried Rice
- Seafood soup
- Chicken satay (appetizer)
- Roasted duck curry

I know i've missed a few dishes but you can't really go wrong. A definite must-try if you love Thai food. Be sure to check out the seasonal items as well. 

Other notes:
The location is a bit hidden and sign (green at night) isn't flashy. You may also see a few people waiting outside. But when you walk in, you'll see that LoS proudly display articles and photos with celebs and people within the community. The restaurant is nicely lit and atmosphere can get a bit loud, but not annoying at all.",0,0,0

I came for the lobster. Okay, well, at least that's what I intended on ordering before I heard the price and the amount! 5 lbs??? OMG! Maybe when I bring a few extra mouths to feed it'll be worth it, but for hubby and I, it was just too much...considering we wanted to order more than one dish.

I will be back for this one day...
**Lobster-5lbs-$100**

So, instead we ended up ordering:

Golden Prawns=LOVED IT, WANT MORE, YOU MUST ORDER!!! HECK, ORDER 2!!! 
Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodles=THIS WAS ANOTHER FAVE! YUMMY!! Duck over thick rice noodles.
Thai Beef Salad-Didn't really like. It was too saucy for me.
Hor Mok Sea Bass-Yeah, not a real fan of this either. No comment.

One thing I really hoped for was free refills on their thai tea. There's a couple of places where I live that offer unlimited refills (which keeps bringing me back). While the food is pretty good here, unlimited refills would be the cherry on my sundae.

Things to remember:
1. Make reservations (esp if you're coming in a large group)
2. The back of the restaurant faces the street. So you won't see the entrance until you drive into the parking lot.

FINALLY, I was able to dine at the famous Lotus of Siam. For years I've been hearing positive reviews about this place, and how the food is spectacular. My co-workers suggested we head over there to have me try their lunch buffet, which they told me they've enjoyed in the past. 

The buffet setup is located in the central part of the older dining room. If I can recall, 15-20 items are served, from hot foods to desserts. I grabbed my plate and piled on the Pad Thai, egg rolls, tempura veggies and yellow curry chicken.

Pad Thai: Nothing to write home about.

Egg Rolls: I'm hesitant when trying egg rolls at restaurants. For me it's hit or miss. The egg rolls I tried at Lotus were easily forgettable. Just your typical deep fried veggie egg rolls.

Yellow Curry Chicken: Too watery in my opinion, and not enough chicken, veggies, curry, or spices.

Tempura Veggies: Not even sure if the veggies were really tempura battered. Perhaps it was deep fried for too long, because they were too brown.

For dessert I tried the banana egg rolls, which is the best item from that buffet. I enjoyed the taste of the sweetened, finely shredded coconut combined with a ripened banana. 

I really wanted to give Lotus of Siam a great review, but the buffet food was mediocre. I'll have to return another time to try their entrees.",4,1,1

I had waited two months to visit as a special occasion for my birthday and I passed up going to Ramsay's Steak House for this!  We moved here 3 months ago from Seattle  where there is an abundance of Asian restaurants so I know good Thai food!!! First, yes it's a little whole in the  wall which I was prepared for from doing my research but REALLY their sign wasn't even illuminated on the building making it difficult to even see the dang place in the dark. Then the hour long wait even though i called promptly when their doors opened that evening to make reservations and was told they where full. Finally seated, I had already chosen my entree by looking at there website and although I wanted to order 12 things I chose a fave of Moo Yang.  Had an appetizer of tempura, I have never had tempura with thick crunchy  batter.....that's not tempura. And it was suppose to be vege and shrimp, there where 4 small pieces of vege and the shrimp had been cut in half all for 10.95.  For such a huge menu was disappointing there wasn't no crab rangoons or fresh rolls on there app menu. My entre of Moo Yang was DRY almost shamefully so! No vege's  just a plate of meat that looked like it was tossed around the plate to make it appear it fllled the plate......... horrible presentation.and when the server offered me sticky rice I anxiously said yes but he failed to tell me he was going to charge me an extra 2.00. My husband had crab fried rice, rice looked like it was FRIED for maybe five seconds, just a plate of steamed rice as far as i was concerned.  Last observation I made no spices on the table!!!! Come on!!!! This place is renowned so being busy doesn't cut it!  There decor was not aesthetically pleasing especially the numerous pictures on the wall above me of chef and various clients in cheap frames and hanging crooked on the wall.  I have no intentions on every returning, So now my quest goes on for some descent Thai food! Having some serious withdrawals!!! I miss my Chili Thai :((((",1,1,1

Nevada natives, Ethiopian, Vietnamese, and Nigerian ex-pats and a fiery Argentinian abuelita [although she didn't look a day over 50] were some of the most memorable faces.

Yet our driver on our trip to Lotus of Siam,  with whom I built the strongest rapport, was the most interesting of them all. Ironically, he was himself, Thai, and a former restauranteur in Las Vegas proper. We spoke of thai dishes, international travel and our mutual distaste for pad thai sauce in a bottle.

At some point during our dialogue, I asked the lingering question, ""So...is Lotus of Siam REALLY as good as they say it is? Is it the best Thai restaurant in the country?"" To this, he replied with a simple shake of his head and a ""No"". ""If you want good Thai food, go to Thai Town in Hollywood."" He clarified.

I am grateful to this man for lowering my expectations of Lotus of Siam, it's never a good idea to go into a restaurant experience believing that the food should be the ""BEST"" -- a recipe for disaster. So with a newly acquired, down-2-earth perspective, I entered the packed Lotus of Siam and prepared for a memorable experience.

Ambiance:

After the Travel Channel stakes claim to a restaurant, one of two things are bound to happen. Either the restaurant will cling to or completely abandon it's former character in the face of extreme ""over-night"" popularity. Fortunately, it seems that Lotus of Siam, while extremely crowded, has apparently retained most of it's pre-celebrity essence.

It looks like...well...a family-run Thai restaurant. The only difference was an entry w\/o standing room, a policy that reservations are lost after 5 minutes of seating time [if a ""no-show""], and an elaborate walk-in wine cellar in the middle of the restaurant.

Food:

The Pad See Ew, Fried Rice and Mint Chicken where all winners; but the two dishes which stood out in my mind where the Garlic Prawns and Jackfruit Curry.

Garlic Prawns: Full prawns, shells included, which where completely edible from head to tail. Crispy, moist and über flavorful.

Thum Ka Noon: This northern-style, non-coconut milk curry is made with young jackfruit and shredded dried fish. The curry broth was like none I had ever tried. It was a fan-favorite around the table for dipping, showering over rice or straight up slurping!

So...who was right? Andrew Zimmern or my Thai cab driver? Is this really the best Thai food in the country? Clearly I am not qualified to answer this question. Yet, I can assert that the food was quite memorable and some of the best Thai food I have had to date. Additionally, their unique specialization of Northern Thai cuisine is hard to come by outside of Chiang Mai.",0,0,0

I ordered a cup of Tom Yum Kai and found the chicken to be dry.  The taste was good and light so I suppose that was a plus.  My husband and I decided to order our usual at all Thai restaurants to do a comparison: Panang Curry with chicken and Phad Se-ew with beef.  The panang curry had to have been the worst I've had.  It had only the flavor of coconut milk with no real flavor of curry, dry chicken again and only sliced red peppers.  Did someone forget to add curry powder in it?  The Phad Se-ew was pretty good but still had it better in Manhattan with more flavor.

Despite being off the strip and in a secluded plaza, Lotus of Siam is hyped up by almost any Vegas native\/frequenter who recommends Thai food to you. The head chef is a chef who formerly worked at the Wynn, so it's easy to see why people are excited about it. The place is usually packed with people, so reservations might be recommended (although we just walked in and had no problem getting seated).

The food itself isn't bad. It's chock full of flavor, but I can't say it's the best Thai food I've ever had considering each dish is in the double digits. (Not unusual for Vegas.) We ordered the Pad Thai and sea bass with drunken noodles with two Thai iced teas; everything was decent, but not worth the money, in my opinion.

We arrived just as they opened at 11:30AM, and the place filled up very quickly. It was packed and there was a line by the time we left. 

We ordered the Nam-Prik-Ong, as recommended by Ming Tsai and based on the reviews, as well as the crispy duck over Panang curry. We had the coconut ice cream over sticky rice for dessert. The food was absolutely amazing! 

The Nam-Prik-Ong was the perfect blend of spices - savory with a warm spice. It comes with an assortment of things to dip (cucumber, cabbage, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, fried pork rinds), and you can order a side of sticky rice to go with it. It's a perfect little appetizer. 

The crispy duck over Panang curry was the best crispy duck and Panang curry (separately) I have ever had. The duck is pan fried and has a tasty crisp on the outside and is tender and moist (without tasting fatty) on the inside. It wasn't gamey and tasted better than any chicken I've ever eaten. The curry was deliciously made with just the right amount of creaminess and spiciness. 

For dessert, we shared the coconut ice cream over sticky rice. The ice cream wasn't too sweet or overly coconut-y. The sticky rice was warm and ""marinated"" in a coconut milk mixture that gave it the tiniest bit of saltiness that complemented the ice cream beautifully. 

We went for lunch and there was a buffet for $9.99 per person. We decided to eat off of the normal menu because we wanted to experience what all the hype was about. We ended up spending a lot more between the two of us, but it was well worth it.

I have heard of Lotus of Siam in the past - initially on Top Chef Vegas and then on other reviews of James Beard award winners and other nerdy food lovers things. I decided I MUST try it, so I made a reservation on a Friday night right after we got to town. I was so pleased with this decision.

Lotus is in a strip mall off the strip so you will need a car, a taxi, or an Uber\/Lyft to get here. Everything else around it looks a little industrial or sketch and maybe there was a naughty club nearby, but it doesn't matter, just go.

I made a reservation and they say they hold your reservation for precisely...3 minutes...so be on time. We got there right in time, but do allow for traffic when you are coming from the Strip.

I would recommend perusing the menu before you get here. I not only read the menu front to back online (there are a lot of options), I also read some articles about the best things to get here. Of course, when I got there I read the menu again. It is all so exciting, but apparently what they have that many other Thai places don't is Northern Thai cuisine and a killer riesling menu.

We started by ordering an off dry riesling since we aren't much into sweet wines but wanted to try one to complement our spicy dishes. We got a bottle and were not disappointing. Apparently they have one of the best riesling menus of anywhere around and they really do go well with Thai food. Try some!

As for the food, I went with the waiter's recommendation of Nam Kao Tod. That's crispy rice with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, onions, ground dry chiles, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. I have never had anything like this. We went with 5 out of 10 on spice level to see what we were working with here and it was pretty spicy and it was fucking delicious. The crispy rice was a new one on me, it was like each individual piece of rice had been fried in spices and was individually crunchy and flavorful. I mean, it was a home run.

For entrees, we went Northern Thai to see what that was all about. I got Kang Ka Noon which is spicy young jack fruit curry. I mainly got this because I've never had jack fruit and I wanted that. I got it with pork, 5 out of 10 on spice. The curry was not thick, almost more like a stew. Jack fruit has an artichoke-like consistency so if you don't like that, you may not like this. Again, I have never had anything like this and we enjoyed it. The BF ordered the Sai Oua which is Northern style pork sausage. It was ground pork with herbs and spices and come pretty much medium spiced. It was sliced on the plate. I don't even know what is going on with this sausage, but we were in LOVE with it. What is that spice in there? We spent a lot of time trying to place it...anise? Nutmeg? Other? Just get this, it is soooooo goooood. We had all this with some sticky rice (and the curry also came with rice so that was a DOH on our part...).

I must mention that this place is deceptively enormous inside and can seat a lot of people, but there are a lot of people there so be prepared to wait if you have no reservations. HOWEVER, despite the crush of people there, the waitstaff are really on point. They have bluetooth earpieces and talk to each other and everything just flows. Really a good setup.

I was DELIGHTED, ECSTATIC, OVERWHELMED WITH JOY about Lotus of Siam. I WILL be back on every trip to Vegas.",4,4,3

Here's what we had:
Garlic  shrimp  - omg, it is really really good and a must try. A little expensive $21.95 but so worth it to try. The shrimp is taken out of the shell but they include the shell as part of your dish. They cook the shrimp shell to a perfect crisp, almost like eating a chip. 

Khai Soi - $8.95 - also very good. It's noodles in a curry sauce, almost like a soup 

Tom Kah Kai - $4.95 cup - the best darn soup ever!!! It's very similar to tom yum soup but with coconut milk and a little spicier too. Mouth watering goodness and def. a must order!

Deep Fried Sea Bass - $28.95 - very good but in my opinion, pretty small for the price. It's deep fried in some kind of a chili sauce.

1. THE FOOD: Amazing! Their food is fantastic. Everything is good; I have yet to try anything ""bad"" here. The portions are decently sized, the flavour is full on. I suggest ordering things on the less spicy side of the spectrum so you can add spice to it once it's served. Got overzealous and ordered a 6 on the spicy scale. Was a little too much!

2. THE WINE LIST: Last thing I would have anticipated is a good wine list at a Thai restaurant in a strip mall in Las Vegas. BUT, this place blows it out of the water with their wine list! Definitely ask a server for pairing recommendations for your order.

3. THE PRICING: IMO, their pricing is very fair for the quality and quantity of the food that you get. Order away, good sir!

The negatives are a little bit out of the restaurants control, but still something to take into consideration:

1. LOCATION: The restaurant is located in a rather dark strip mall that is closed off from major streets. Don't be too worried, but keep your wits about you. Have been here a dozen times without incident, and haven't heard of any issues. Just looks a little...shady.

2. SPEED OF SERVICE: Sometimes the restaurant is so packed, service is a little slow...too slow for my taste. BUT the food outweighs the negative for me, so I deal with it.

3. LENGTH OF TIME TO GET SEATED: Be prepared for a wait! Sometimes you can wait here for up to an hour. Yes, it's that good.




Would I recommend this place to others? Absolutely.

Would I come back here myself? Thinking about going again tonight now that I've written this review!!!",3,3,4

The location is very concealed away from the strip. I had a bit of a hard time looking for it but after a few rounds in the shopping center I've seen the green light!! I came around dinner time 8ish to be exact. There was a wait and a bunch of people already waiting in the waiting, I was not surprised. I waited less than the 30min they said it would take to be seated. I was very amused at how fast I was able to be seated. The inside of the restaurant is nice and big. I didn't realize it could seat a lot of people AND I MEAN A LOT!! It was packed for a Monday night. 

As soon as we got seated I quickly glanced over the menu and ordered right away. I was very hungry. I ordered the papaya salad, charbroiled pork, red curry, and Tom yum. Let's start with the papaya salad. My server asked what spice level I would like my Papaya salad to have ranging from a 1-10, I said a 3. When I took my first bite of the salad I was expecting a mild taste, but no it felt like a burning 10!!! The spice was too overpowering and I could hardly taste the real flavor of the salad. I had a Thai iced tea on the side & I literally gulped more than half just so my mouth could cool down. I was very upset :( I love papaya salad and just having this to be too spicy really just killed my appetite. I ordered the red curry with beef. I was scared that it was going to be really spicy like the papaya salad but it wasn't at all! It had a small hint of spicy. It was so creamy and delicious. Just thinking about it is making my mouth salivate. The charbroiled pork was amazing as well! But I could compare it to other charbroiled pork I've had at other Thai\/Vietnamese restaurants. The only thing that stood out about it was the dipping sauce. I'm not quite sure what type of sauce it was but it had green onions and was a cross between salty, sour, and sweet. The Tom yum was ok. Like other yelpers have mention it's nothing that's great. 

The customer service was spectacular. We always had our waters and rice refilled & asked how we were doing.

we ordered:
garlic prawns - so much great garlic flavor, freshly fried but with a light better. such a nice crisp to it and you cant even tell that it's fried with the shell still on it
drunken noodles with sea bass - my favorite dish of my lunch! the sea bass was fried with a light batter that almost reminded me of like an agedashi tofu dish. it was so delicious though and paired with the fat noodles - the best!
beef dish w\/peanut sauce - cant remember the name of this dish but it was strips of steak with mixed veggies over this amazing peanut sauce that we were pretty much just dipping in everything haha
crispy duck in red curry - another amazing dish. luckily we had ordered this only at a spice level 2 out of 10 and it had the right amount of kick to it where we could still appreciate the flavor of the curry without having our mouths on fire haha.
fried banana for dessert - even this simple dessert at most restaurants came out way above average haha. banana was fried in more of an egg roll wrapper and freshly fried with a great crisp\/crunch to it. (seriously whatever they're doing here to fry their food is amazing haha)

I followed the advice to order Northern Thai special dishes which you don't find in many Thai restaurants. 
1) red chili dip: delicious. The meat sauce was yummy. It wasn't spicy and great dip with the fresh veggies 
2) koong char num plar (raw prawns): loved this dish we ordered 2. You add some of the specify sweet sauce, some spicy sauce, mint leaves and garlic. Explosion of flavors in your mouth. In most Thai restaurant I would be scared to eat raw prawns but not here!
3) thum-ka noon (pounded young jack fruit shredded). This is interesting dish. Didn't look nor taste like what I had expected. I don't think I've ever had jack fruit. It was great with rice
4) khao Soi (northern Thai noodle dish). This was my favorite dish
5) Northern Thai sausages. Loved the variety of taste

(http:\/\/www.lamag.com\/features-hidden\/2013\/05\/16\/vegas-chefs-choice) 

Really now mister fancy chef dude? With all of the top notch Thai places in LA that is a rather bold statement and I decided I must witness such cuisine myself. 

My wife and I are in Vegas and we decide to make the trek from the strip to this place that is located in an oddball shopping center. We saw the place and were skeptical... we walked in and our nostrils were immediately welcomed by delicious Thai aromas. Skepticism melted away as we walked past the bunch of people waiting around for a table. We put our name down and the wait was long - I wish we had made a reservation. That right there folks is the only gripe I have.

When the hostess took us to our table she warned us that since they are busy the wait for our food might be lengthy. At that point we had already invested too much time to turn back and after looking at all of the yelp reviews we were ready to try this stuff, so that warning did not detour us. We were then greeted by a friendly waiter and he took our drink and food orders efficiently. The hostess' warning turned out to be unnecessary as our food came out in a very reasonable amount of time. 

Okay, enough semantics. The FOOD. Oh, the glorious food. The drunken noodles with soft-shell crab were stunning. I took the first bite and I felt my eyes pop out of my head. The flavors were so amazing! Then the panang curry with crispy duck was unbelievable. I've had ""crispy duck"" before and never, never in my life has it been as delightfully crispy as it is here. Perfection!  

My wife and I dine at some pretty spectacular places when we are in Vegas and we have talked about this meal more than any other. I will certainly be returning to this place each and every time I go to Vegas. So, yes. Mister fancy chef dude's bold statement is absolutely valid. Yes, I too am blown away by their amazing Thai food!",1,1,1

I'm pretty good with spicy food, but this was just a little over my threshold for enjoyment. There was a some minor panic and coughing but it subsided after about 10 minutes. I should have started a little lower level and worked up. It's all about your preference, of course. 

For entrees we split the steak salad and the house special fried rice. They both offered a range of flavor and their own nuances. I would order them both again. I can't wait to go back and delve into some curry, noodles, and specialty items.

First wine selection is GREAT. Ordered a bottle of a nice Riesling as Riesling pairs very well with spicy food. Wine was great. 

Food - ordered a soup with shrimp and clear broth. It was spicy and good. Ordered some spring rolls for my daughter who likes basic Asian food - she's boring but I love her, she's a pre teen so don't hold her food tastes against her yet. Spring rolls were good. Then I ordered garlic prawns, chicken pad Thai, duck drunken noodles and duck panang. Omg duck was phenomenal. Panang was my favorite and best I ever had. My mouth is watering thinking about it. The garlic prawns were good but I think I imagined them to be more decadent since it appears from reviews they are the claim to fame.

Lotus of Siam has definitely expanded since my last visit, having taken over the space next door so that the location is now huge.  I worried upon arriving, resevation-less, on a Sunday at 5:30pm, opening time, and seeing guests lined up at the door, but once I set foot into the seating area, I could see that accommodating us, along with anyone behind us in line, was a non-issue.

The menu, 15 pages with at least 10 offerings per page, can be overwhelming, so try to do your order research ahead of time.  The two of us went for the following, and boy did we hit our max:

- Nam Kao Tod (4 stars): unlike anything I've eaten before.  Spicy, tangy, and citrus-y with crispy rice (love)
- Roasted Duck Curry (3 stars): just your standard duck with red curry.  Passable, especially with other much more enticing options
- Sea Bass Drunken Noodle (5 very enthusiastic stars): at $29, definitely not inexpensive, but worth every deep-fried and wonderfully crisp, rich, and succulent sea bass bite.  Request mild if you can't handle spice because this delicious dish is packed with Thai chilis
- Mango Sticky Rice (4 stars): perfectly sweet and smooth mango coupled with coconutty sticky rice

This was most certainly the best meal of my trip.  I am not much a fan of Vegas and have avoided the city for the past four years after countless previous trips, but now I am looking forward to returning if only to eat every meal at Lotus of Siam (of course with the Seabass Drunken Noodles).",5,2,2

Beef salad with raw eggplant - first time I've ever had raw eggplant. Interesting texture. Seasoned very nicely with lemongrass cutting through. Large chunks of beef that is tender. Bit heavy on the raw onions. Level 10 spicy blows your socks off.

Thinking that it would be packed as it was last week, we tried calling in to make reservations. To our disappointment, they wouldn't accept reservations on a Friday night so we decided to make it out there anyways. It's not too far off the strip but be sure to have a good lookout because we nearly missed it if a friend had not pointed out an Indian cuisine sign right next to Lotus of Siam.

This place is literally fabulous! The food is great, service is fast, and the portions are just right (for those who enjoy moderate portions). Please order the following:

Here are a few highlights: som tam - as bombing as it should be, but if you don't like spice stay away from that one!  Snow crab with ginger, apples, lime and more.  Wow!  An entire deep fried catfish that was the most perfectly fried fish you can imagine, and came served with some incredible sweet and spicy sauce; crispy duck in green curry that was the best prepared duck I have ever had (think a skin that defines crispy, succulent meat, and not a drip of fat to be found), in a super flavorful curry with bamboo shoots; Chinese broccoli with deep fried pork lardons - call the doctor!  And many other great dishes we could share with our large party.  Some of the stuff just came out from the kitchen when they realized we were not there for Pad Thai and spring rolls.  In every way, the service was exceptional, and when the bill came I could not have been more happy.

On to food:
Crispy duck panang- no joke, this is absolutely ridiculously delicious! It isn't spicy and is a type of red curry.  Drizzle on rice and take a bite of the duck=heaven.

Crispy rice (nam kao tod)- so so so so so good.  Order your own, so good you don't want to share.  Perfect amount of spice and leaves a good citrus tang at the end of each bite

Drunken noodle with beef- I originally wanted the one with soft shell crab but they didn't have any on the night I went :(  The beef is pretty standard and so were the noodles.  Not that it was bad but since everything else was amazing, this is pretty standard

Tiger prawn wrapped in bacon and wonton wrappers- pretty average.  I mean it's good cuz its a tiger prawn wrapped in bacon and wonton but nothing unique.  I'd suggest saving space for the other better things.

Thai tea-  hard to mess this one up overall but pretty damn good.  The tea they used is brewed pretty strong and I can tell cuz it leaves the bitter tea after taste but that's how I like it

Tip: Make a reservation! Guaranteed during prime dinner time you'll wait 45-60min.  I called for reso a month ago and the convo went like this, ""I'd like to make reservations.

The food we ordered was from the Chef's special. The Nim Prok dip wasn't that great. It was a dip for various veggies and pork rinds.
The salt and pepper prawns were very good, and the panang curry was good too.
Do you notice that I am repeating the word ""good?""
Well, for the price, it is super $$$ for the main entrees.
The only thing that pretty much redeemed it, was the sticky rice and mango.
At $8 a pop, it was worth it.

I wouldn't say hidden because this place was packed and very popular with the locals and I, being a native of Cali, this place was a good find.

I'm not familiar with Thai food at all so I had to yelp it to see what people craved here. Only thing I knew on the menu was pad tai noodles.  Nam Kai Tod was a good appetizer to begin with. Some sort of sweet crispy brown rice. You have to try this if you have not before.  My partner in crime ordered the glass noodle salad which had a very lime taste to it.  I love sour food and the flavor was just perfect.  It's not an appetizer but it might as well be because even an anorexic can't get full from the amount of glass noodles that was served.  Best to order one for yourself instead of having to share it just as I and my friend did.  Next on the line was the drunken seafood noodle. I'm not very good in describing flavors but I'm just here to tell you this was freaking delicious. It gave many options of flavors in one plate, from shrimp to muscles and the noodles in it.  And the last was the dessert! Damn I've never had one this good. Coconut ice cream on sticky sweet rice. One word to describe this is, can I have some more!? Alright it wasn't one word but you know what i mean.

The only sour taste that came out from this was I had to pay for her too. Wtf, she's my ex, haven't the rules changed? I ain't gotta pay for you no more, but I hate looking like cheap boyfriend in front of the server because we look like we're on a date.

For entrees, the braised shortribs with panang was very good, especially with sticky rice. And I really liked the rad na. It's always one of my favorite dishes, and they did it quite well.

I'm an avid Thai food eater so this place was definitely where I wanted to eat for my first non-partying weekend in Vegas.

They have an automated system where they text you when you're table is ready. 

The inside was nice and cozy. I really like the glass wine case that you see when you walk in. The lighting was dim but not too dark to set the ambiance just right. The place seemed clean although I don't know how much I trust carpet in a restaurant..

We ordered a Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, beef Penang curry, and a Thai tea. They brought out the 2 noodle dishes first and then the curry. I ordered beef penang but the waiter brought out chicken. A minor hiccup, I simply told the waiter I had ordered beef and so he had it changed for me. 

I judge a Thai restaurant by their Pad Thai and their Thai tea. I must say I was a little disappointed with the pad Thai. It was a little dry and lacking in flavor. The Thai tea was great though. The beef Penang curry was good. I got a 3 on their spicy-ness scale and it was perfect for me. The Pad See Ew dish was the best thing we ordered though. It was moist and flavorful.

And most folks who eat here love it. Having said that, I just don't get Lotus of Siam. Sure, it's good; the curries are balanced and the salads, and noodle dishes are tasty, but I feel that this is a place that is more concerned with it's reputation as the premier Thai restaurant in the area than the menu. They have tailored their dishes for farang, (foreign), meaning our milder,  palates. What is with the wine obsession? I have never experienced a Thai restaurant anywhere that directs such focus on wine. Not that it's a bad thing, I personally enjoy a glass of Pinot Grigio with a Glass Noodle Salad, for example, but it comes off to me as a little snobbish. The staff are courteous, but seem harried and too busy. The service is good, but I like to chat in Thai to my server and or hostess, and they just don't seem to have the time. Those who are seeking authentic Thai food should try some of the other Thai restaurants in town. Each one is different and I don't really have a favorite, although the beef salad at Pin Kaow is excellent, the curries at Komol Kitchen are mind blowing, (the pastes are made from scratch), and the Larb at Ocha is the best I've ever had anywhere! Order it with sticky rice. There are a few Thai places in Vegas I've not tried, mostly because of their location relative to my home, but for my money, eating Thai means enjoying the personality of the restaurant, the proprietor, & the food. In these areas, Lotus of Siam is little better than average, and the lunch buffet is the only thing I eat there if I'm on my lunch break and am in need of a quick Thai fix.

It's just... well, good.  That's what my three star review says.  If this was my neighborhood Thai restaurant, I wouldn't hesitate being a regular.  But I certainly wouldn't fly across the country to come eat here like I would... say, for Arun's in Chicago. 
After my first visit here a couple of months ago, I hesitated in writing a not-so stellar review.  I was puzzled at what the other people were tasting that I wasn't.  The other reason why I was reluctant to write one was 'coz I felt it would be an unfair write-up after only trying mostly their Northern Thai dishes.  Yes, we enjoyed the nam kao tod - minced sour sausage appetizer a lot but everything else paled in comparison to what I expected.  The northern larb was far inferior to the regular larb, and the much acclaimed kung ka noon which is a spicy young jack fruit curry was far from yummy - almost a dish that requires an acquired taste.  

I resisted from writing a two star review then... so today, we returned to order a bunch of food that weren't just what other moronic non-Thai- food-eating-'experts' claimed excellent, but ordered what we normally enjoy.  I feel that following food critics reviews on ethnic food may be a little tricky.  But having gone to Thailand a gazilion times since I was 3, went to cooking school there and grew up around the region, I know what Thai food (in the Bangkok area) should taste like.

Today we ordered the vegetarian egg rolls, tod mun plar (fish cakes), and yum woon seng (seafood glass noodle 'salad') for appetizers; crispy mussel omelette, chicken green curry and pad thai for entree.  Yes, two noodle dishes.  I love my noodles :)  My favorite dish at this meal was the mussel omelette.  It was close to what it should taste like and I enjoyed the nice crunch.  This dish is enjoyed both in Thailand and some other parts of South East Asia (though oysters are often used - minus the crispy part).  The green curry, I felt, lack flavor and spice even though we asked for very spicy (7 out of 10 for spice).  DO NOT order the pad thai here.  It is NOT what pad thai should taste nor look like.

Other options well received by this party of five were the pad thai and curries. Prices are generally between $9 and $15, super cheap for Vegas, especially for food of this quality. 

Decor is not what you're here for- it's standard, aside from the star studded wall with tons of pictures of the head chef (owner?) with the who's who of Food Network. Bathrooms are a tad sketchy, but clean. This place takes reservations and is extremely popular, so make them if you can. The only hiccup for our party was that one of our group did not receive their meal until we reminded the server. Everyone else had rec'd their entrees and it was clear they had somehow missed that part of the order. Unfortunately, there was no discount given or even an apology for that mishap, which lengthened our time at the restaurant significantly.

I think the food was average and normally  would have given 2 stars or at best 2.5 stars. I have been to Thailand at least 4-5 times and I know what food should taste like. And this is the second time I have eaten here. The food was better and more authentic before. Somehow their quality has gone down.......probably they have become complacent. It is a pity to see a good restaurant drop so much in quality. Let me more specific....their starters i.e. Tom Yum soup was just spicy without the flavors. When we reordered they made it so bland that it was difficult to finish it. I patiently went ahead with the order for main dish hoping that the starter was an anomaly and each and every dish was below to just around average.  

The service is absolutely atrocious. They gave me an estimate of the  wait of 1.5 hrs, and then suddenly they texted within 30 minutes that the table is waiting. Then within 10 minutes of the  text they cancelled my place in the line. I managed to get back and wish my place in line was really taken. The main dish took almost 1 hr and that too when we had to remind the server at least 3 times. The whole sub-par meal with horrible service including  the co-ordination took me about 3 hrs . And this is when we had so many other options in Vegas. What a waste. For average to below average food, a stip mall location, it is just not worth it. 

hence the 1 star.",1,1,1

So, when my Bangkok-born mother-in-law told me that Lotus of Siam is right on par with restaurants in Thailand, I had to go and see how it compared to the other Thai places I had experienced. 

This place is a bit on the pricey side but it does not disappoint. Although it is located in the 'hood, the interior of the restaurant is quite nice and spacious. I was also surprised to find that many celebrity chefs have dined at Lotus of Siam. In sum, the food is amazing and service is directly on-point. The restaurant is consistently packed so you should make reservations in advance - that is, unless you know the owners like my MIL.

We ordered the Tom Yum Kung (spicy lemongrass soup with shrimp etc.), Larb (ground pork salad), sticky rice, vegetarian fried rice, Nua Dad Deaw (beef jerky) and garlic prawns. Order the garlic prawns and eat the shell!!! This dish is so good that it will make you want to run to the ocean, hop on a boat, catch prawns to extinction, and bring them to Lotus of Siam to cook up! Other than the prawns, the rest of the dishes were comparable to those served at other good Thai establishments.

Dinner for 4 cost about $100. Not bad for a four-and-a-half-stars meal.",2,0,2

For a restaurant to be considered the ""best"" for its cuisine, class, etc.--everything you order should be exceptional or at least above average.

That being said, the drunken seafood noodle was definitely a hit. Absolutely delicious. I love spicy food so I got it at an 8 on their 1 - 10 spicy scale and it was perfect for me! Although an 8 would probably be way too spicy for most...if you eat spicy food reguarly, a 5 or 6 would probably be good enough. If you eat American-ized ""spicy,"" go for 2 - 3.

We also ordered the Pad Thai, Tom Yum Noodle Soup, and Red Curry to share. Pad Thai was way below average, one of the worst \/ least flavorful renditions of this dish I've ever had. Tom Yum Noodle soup was well below average as well and again, one of the worst I've had of this dish. Red Curry was okay, nothing to rave or write home about but not horrible--not really my style so I rarely order this dish and can't really compare it to others I've tried.

I guess I'm spoiled by the countless amazingly delish, authentic, AND affordable Thai restaurants that line the streets of Manhattan and Queens in my hometown of NYC but I just don't understand all the hype about this place. I would say its worth stopping by just to say you did. Also, it may be worth coming back just for the drunken seafood noodle dish. 

Everything, other than the drunken noodle dish, is just okay at best if you're a seasoned Thai food connoisseur or even just a seasoned foodie. To me, it seems like one of those places that perhaps once was great but let the hype get to their heads. Now, all the raving reviews are from tourists who just like to hype it up for the fact that they can say they dined where all the celebrities (whose photographs line the wall) had dined.

The Short Version:
5 stars for Drunken Seafood Noodle
1 star for pad thai and tom yum noodle
3 stars for red curry
3 stars for the long wait for a table despite there being so many empty tables open (try to call ahead and make a reservation if possible)",2,0,1

WHERE: In the Korean plaza on Sahara & Commercial.

WHEN: For lunch, they are open from 11:30a-2:30p. They are closed from 2:30p-5:29p, and reopen for dinner at 5:30p-10:00p (I learned this the hard way because I was actually craving their food today and went at 2:45 only to find out they were closed... wahh! My excitedness got the best of me because I didn't even bother checking their hours. WOMP WOMP WOMPPP!)

WHAT: Prior to coming here for the first time (Yesterday, December 9th), I have always passed by, heard from other people, and have actually seen them on TV! Thankfully one of my best friends has been wanting to come here, so we made it a Date!

We came for dinner (I heard they have a buffet for lunch *wink wink*), and waited about 15 minutes to get seated. The restaurant was pretty huge for what I thought it would be, and it was definitely ON AND POPPIN' because every single table was taken.

When we were seated, our server helped us to a glass of water right away, and constantly checked if we were doing okay. My friend and I finally got to ordering:

We both got cups of soup, which I love, because not a lot of thai places offer cups of soup! =D (Or at least the ones that I have gone to). My favorite soup ever is Tom Kah Kai (because of the coconut milk added). My friend got a tamarind base soup, which was remarkably soothing on a cold winter night.

For our main dishes, we both got curries. I tried the Musaman curry with veggies and tofu, which was extremely tasteful, my friend got the Green curry with a kick of spice- really good as well!

There were so many other things I wanted to try on their menu, but I think my eyeballs were playing tricks on me because I for sure wouldn't have finished it all!

So... GO, GO, GO! I'll probably be back in a few days because I want to try their CRISPY DUCK. MUAHAHA!

Someone told me that Lotus of Siam was on a food show and the Yelp reviews were good, so we decided to give it a try. This is located in an obscure strip mall. We almost missed it, but we saw a lot of people waiting outside so we figured we were in the right place. We went inside and because there was only 2 of us, we got seated right away. The restaurant itself is very nice, clean and spacious.  The busser brought our drinks very quickly. 

We decided to try the Nua Nam Tok (BBQ beef dish) and the garlic pepper prawns (both under the BBQ in the menu). The food came out pretty quickly. The food was pretty amazing. The beef dish had tons of spices (cilantro, mint, green onion, red onion - just to name a few) that worked well together. It was so good! Be careful how spicy you get it. We got it medium and our mouth was on fire at the end of the meal. The BBQ prawns were my favorite. The shrimp, which came with an amazing garlic pepper sauce, was so good and tender. Its definitely a must try. It's a little on the pricey side at $25 for 8 prawns, but I would definitely get it again. 

Overall, I am so glad that I decided to give this place a try. One minor complaint that I have is that we only saw our waiter twice, once to take out order and once to take our check. We ended up flagging down another waiter when we wanted to order additional rice. But, it was not too big of a deal as the other waiters was willing to help us.

This place gets busy!!! So come right when they open. Their reservation list also gets filled quick so make reservations in advance. Me and my friends came here and waited like 30-45 mins. I find their service to be somewhat slow, not because our waiter was slow, but because their waitstaff was slow when setting up and cleaning the tables. The food came out at a decent time considering they were extremely packed on a Saturday night. 

The only big problem I have with this place is that their portions are pretty small. If you plan on sharing with a big group of people, I suggest ordering two of the same dish. Their noodle & curry dishes were especially small. Also when we ordered the mango sticky rice, there wasn't that much rice, it was a horrible mango to rice ratio.

Must get: according to my friends their crispy garlic prawns! This is a must, my friends were drooling over this dish for the longest time. They also said the duck curry is delicious as well. Oh and order the Thai tea as your drink. 

I tried their fried tofu, pad see ew and pad Thai. All these dishes taste the same everywhere else, it just cost more here and the portions are a lot smaller. 

Mango sticky rice was bomb! Loved how the rice wasn't too sweet, it was perfect, just wish there was more rice. The fried bananas were also yummy as well if you like bananas. 

Overall a yummy dinner, this place is just expensive for the amount of food they give you.",2,1,2

But, we did have to wait 45 minutes on a Thursday night ... reservations are definitely an advantage and highly recommended (along with the WIG SHOP next door)! 

Highlights were ... First and foremost ... definitely the FABULOUS wine list (if you like Riesling, you'll LOVE this selection ... and WHAT would better calm your fiery taste buds after some chili paste???) ... the Tom Yum Kai soup is delish (but you'd better enjoy some spicy, tingling lips afterward)... and the sea bass special that was sprinkled with fresh basil, mint and chili oil. OMFG ... YUM! The NUA DAD DEAW ( Beef jerky Issan style) ap had great flavor ... but definitely traditional JERKY STYLE (dry and hard to chew). I've had better Thai-style jerky that was thicker, crispy on the outside, but very tender on the inside. The NAM KAO TOD (crispy rice) was very unique and I would highly recommend.

I think the highlight was their insane wine selection. And I didn't get a chance to really look but it must of been decent prices b\/c the table next to us was ordering bottles of Cakebread, like it was soda or something. Our waitress recommended a glass of Sauvignon Blanc that we both enjoyed. 

Food: 
Sea Bass in ginger sauce- not the whole seabass that some Thai places give, but I think I like it better this way.
Shrimp Pad Thai- the other fattie I was with, seemed to like this dish alot. Kept ranting and raving about it being the best Pad Thai since being in Thailand. I guess there's some credibility to Chef P's statements
Green curry- loved it, nice and spicy. But could probably get that at any Thai place in LA.

Garlic Prawns - amazing! these massive prawns are deep fried and lightly seasoned. You get both the meat and shell. The shell is deep fried to the point of crunchy awesomeness. 

Crispy Duck in Panang Curry - one of the best Panang curry in a long time and the best Thai dish I have had in a while. The crispy duck is definitely crispy and the duck pairs really well with the spicy curry. Definitely pour some on top of rice to have a great meal. 

Soft Shell Crab Drunken Noodles - delicious! There is so much basil flavor and have plenty of soft shell crab to go around! The signature ingredient is the baked\/dried basil that gives it a very unique flavor compared to other Thai restaurants that I have tried. Definitely worth ordering!

Thai Tea - a must get if you're ordering spicy food. It tastes fresh and not too sweet.

GARLIC PRAWNS.

My family goes to Vegas (from Hawaii) 4 times a year and this is the one restaurant they go to every... single... time.

This time my husband and I came on our own. 

We ordered papaya salad, chicken pad thai, and the famous garlic prawns. Also, one thai iced coffee and one thai iced tea. The salad was a good sized portion, but we think it was overly dressed, or they just didn't drain out enough of the liquid before serving it. It definitely packed some heat though. For both the papaya salad and the pad thai, we got to choose our spice level. We like it spicy, but went with a middle number on the scale, as thai spicy is usually more intense, and it was perfect for us. I've had their pad thai before and thought it was amazing, but this time around it just seemed mediocre to me (possibly because it was not even warm, like it had been sitting for a while, when it got to our table). So why the five stars? We came here for the prawns. I repeat: COME FOR THE GARLIC PRAWNS. It's expensive, but a huge portion, and totally worth it. It comes with the shells too, which are also DELICIOUS. They're like crispy garlicky potato chips. 

The price overall seems high, but what we ordered could easily feed 4 people. We took more than half of it for leftovers the next day. So it's actually very reasonably priced. 

Service was okay. Our server wasn't very attentive but it was easy enough to flag down people if we needed anything. 

We will be back (just like my family does 4x a year). Obviously, for the garlic prawns.",3,0,0

My second visit was back in 2011, and I thought the food was good at that time, but wasn't blown away. 

My recent visit, I went with a group and ordered several different items to try.

Garlic prawns- 5 stars. This is a must order. I would come back and get this without a question. 

Crispy duck panning curry - 2 stars. The panang curry was a bit lacking for me, and the duck was the best part. 

Stuffed chicken wings- 5 stars. This dish is SOOOO Good. It is stuffed with the insides of vietnamese egg roll type ingredients. I LOVED it. 

Drunken noodles- 2 stars.  I did a double take on this dish, as it was supposed to be an entree, but looked like an appetizer. I felt soooo jipped, and the dish wasn't even that great either. The chicken pieces were dry, and the noodles did not have good flavor. 

Crispy rice dish appetizer- 2 stars.  This dish has basically the flavors of larb on crispy rice. I LOVE larb, and prefer to have it incorporated into ground meats, so I thought this was meh.

D) Curry Noodles: Not bad, but not my favorite
E) Raw shrimp: They had it with their special sauce and with lemon, it was so good
F) Tom Kai Soup: It was good but too sour for me. We can skip it for next time.

This dish was incredibly flavorful and different from any other Asian food I have ever tried (and I live in Chinatown, Philadelphia). The other items were very good, but didn't stand out as much.

What did stand out was the great service. The waitstaff was busy, organized, polite and helpful. Couldn't ask for more!",1,0,2

I will say that our first impression of this place was not good at all. It's not the unassuming building or the location. It's the buffet lunch that they put out there. DON'T try the buffet lunch. Again, DON'T get the buffet lunch. It's terrible. We were there around 12:30 on a Friday and  the steam table trays were half empty. They also took their time replenishing the food, which was slightly better than mediocre, which is not saying much. Service for the buffet was also terrible. Seems like the wait and kitchen staff were more intent on taking care of the menu customers than the buffet customers. I don't understand why restaurants do this. If you are going to offer a buffet, at least keep it hot and full at all times even if the food is not good. If we didn't know about this place, the buffet experience would have turn us off completely and we would never come back. I am tempted to give this place a 3 star except that the food off the menu was so much better and a better representation of this place.

We came back again with great trepidation to try out the menu. Our buffet experience was so bad that we almost didn't come back. We were glad to give them one more chance. They have a great menu and offered northern dishes that we don't see a lot. Food came out quickly and the wait staff was always attentive (unlike the Buffet). Garlic Prawns were fantastic as were the sour rice salad, Khao Soi and the other dishes that we ordered. Their food certainly had more depth to it than what you would find at a typical place.

Ultimately, was this the best Thai restaurant in the nation, probably not. The lunch buffet was a waste of time and money. It shouldn't even be offered for a restaurant like this, where the menu is the gem. However, the menu item were certain unique and good enough that we will come back next time we are in town. for the menu items, NOT the buffet.",0,0,0

My in-laws made a reservation here for the six of us to try Lotus of Siam's most popular dishes. We ordered what all yelpers suggest- Northern Thai food:

1. Khao Soi- best dish of the night. The curry base was delicious- not overpowering. very creamy. I've had better khao soi in LA. 

2. Northern larb (I didn't try it but it was well received by the others in our group).

3. Kang Ka Noon (spicy jack fruit curry with chicken)- Just ok. They warned us this dish is more of a soup, and it is. It is difficult to finish this dish without a spoon. The dish isn't spicy as advertised- maybe they tone it down intentionally? Either way, this dish, to me, was like a thin tomato soup with jack fruit. Not worth the $$.

4. Nam Prik Ong (red chili dip)- is described as being the least spicy, and it's true. No spice as all. It is, however, a nice dip for the veggies, but it is way too much ($10.95) for what is basically a side dish. 

5. Drunken Noodle Prawns- the famous deep fried prawns with drunken noodles. Yes, they are good, but not amazingly good. Definitely crunchy, juicy and flavorful, but I've had much better fried prawns at other restaurants, and definitely cheaper. There were probably three prawns in the dish and about 6 pieces of just the shell. And $25.95 for essentially three prawns is a rip off. Also-- there was probably two drunken noodles on the plate. 

6. Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab- More drunken noodles than crab. However, if you like your noodles very slippery and gummy, get the drunken noodles. This was the spiciest of our dishes and to me the tastiest. They cooked the crabs well, but no claw meat- mostly the smaller legs. I've had soft shell crab at other restaurants in LA that was much more generous with their crab. 

Overall, the food was OK, but I can't justify waiting for hours to eat here. The portion sizes are small. No, I'm not talking small compared to American sized portions-- they are small compared to what I had in Northern Thailand. You can get much better food at other restaurants with less of a wait and for less $$. Don't buy into the hype!",6,4,4

Second time dining at this exemplary Thai restaurant. If you order right, its insanely authentic. Ordered hot at level 8: dry chicken wings, soft shell crab drunken noodles, raw shrimp with insane dips, braised short ribs in a curry. 

The Headline is GERMAN WINES!
Rare is the place that has a decent German wine selection. Here in a North Vegas strip mall lies a true treasure trove. From super dry GGs all the way through TBAs.  Rieslings from all regions, vintages and prices. Page after page of a list that puts pretty much all others to shame. Perfect provenance as demonstrated by the huge glass cellar for available wines. (Undoubtedly there is an offsite too). 
Mark-up on the wines is surprisingly soft considering.

And if you don't know what wine to go with, no worries. The Somm is totally relaxed and helpful. Most people are intimidated by German labels, the only label more confusing than Burgundy, so the Somm will take the time to walk you to your bottle.

So drag yourself off the strip and enjoy a rare experience of the sublime and surreal, locals and smart visitors alike. Those who know go. Again and again.",0,0,0

I also had the Sea Bass Drunken Noodles which was okay.  The sea bass itself was great but the Noodles were about average and didn't have a lot of spice going on despite ordering it at a 6.  Tangent ... the spice scale is never consistent so it's tough to gage if a 6 is going to burn your face off or not have any spice at all.  This time it was not spicy at all, lesson learned.

Next time I stop in I'll level set my expectations and order spicer than a 6.

(sorry Lotus, not knocking you down at all here, but hard to venture away from your local spot once you get comfy!)

Ok, inside, I will say - it is very brightly lit up with multiple chandeliers all over the ceiling. Decor wise, just about every wall space is filled with some group's photo & the owner of the restaurant somewhere. Not really sure what that is about. I know the owner of the restaurant was featured in a chef competition that had aired recently (can't even remember which one to be honest) on Food Network.

Moving on - crab cake appetizer, steamed mussels, crispy duck with chili mint sauce, crab fried rice, and rad na with beef. Crab cake appetizer - took me by surprise as the texture seemed to be more sponge like compared to the european crab cake version. Very tasty, but like I say - just a bit surprised from the texture. Steamed mussels - oh yeah a big hit! We were taken aback by the size of the mussels as they were quite large, but still very tasty! And oh baby does that sauce have some KICK! Not enough to have the fire department putting it out, but a good 'Woah what was THAT?!!!"" sensation. Crispy duck - yup sure was crispy! Meat was very tender though, and the chili mint that accompanies this dish is very refreshing. You can alter your spice level, and if it was a bit hotter would probably be better, but for the heat sensitive you still have a hint of the heat. Crab fried rice - nothing really fancy about this dish it is as it says fried rice with crab in it! Only thing about this dish to say would be to chunk up the crab meat a little more instead of having long leg chunks mixed in, to get a better ratio of crab to rice chunks. And then there is the rad na noodles with beef. The dish came out wallowing in a pot of brown gravy. And I will admit, I was disappointed at the lack of noodles in the mix. We barely had enough to go on 3 plates for the adults and 1 toddler. Plenty of beef was served up mind you, but would have preferred a bit more noodle. And the gravy, well didn't really stand out to my tongue palate - just ok.

Would I eat here again? Maybe to be honest. Personally I find Komol a bit better in the taste department, but I haven't had all the specialties here at Lotus - so I can't really say. But based on what I have experienced - some dishes are WOW, and others are 'eh'.

Service wise - it was busy tonight, and the staff was rushed and you could tell. The front door had a sign up asking customers to expect a 1 hr. wait for their food due to a large group being in the restaurant. We were lucky to get in beforehand, so our service was quick - but you could sense the staff was a little on edge. Our server was friendly and polite enough, but I know they were scrambling to stay on top of the large group. Anyways - that's my word for here. Happy dining!",1,0,0

Pad See Ew with chicken - This is a standard Thai dish that we decided to order, and it was not that great! It was bland and the noodles were cooked too long. I've definitely had better at local Thai places in SoCal. 

Garlic Prawns - Couldn't leave this place without trying this. It's pretty pricey, but was worth the $$ for me! It comes with about 7 pieces of prawns. It was interesting because the shells were deep fried in the garlic mix, and they were so good! This was definitely a hit for me! 

Banana egg roll with coconut ice cream - This is a pretty large dessert for two, but we ended up finishing more than half. The egg roll was filled with bananas and deep fried. The coconut ice cream is the perfect match with the egg rolls. Would highly recommend!

Be prepared for an early dinner or plan when you're going and make reservations (you need to make them at least 7 days in advance). the restaurant opens at 5:30PM and the line is no joke. my friends and I had a large party so we got there at about 5PM and started waiting in line. I thought it was ridiculous that we went so early since we were the only ones waiting in line. lo and behold, 10 minutes later, the line was down the block. doors opened at 5:30PM and the reservations line gets seated first. then my party was first in line to get a table since we got there so early. i looked around as we ordered and the restaurant filled up quickly. 

the restaurant is known for it's northern Thai food so leave the traditional Pad Thai at home. my party decided to order a bunch of food and just share it family style. we had 2 orders of their garlic prawns, the chicken khao soi (chicken served on a bed of egg noodles in a curry base sauce, garnished with sliced red onions, lime and pickled vegetables), nam kao tod (Crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice), drunken noodle soft shell crab, panang curry with crispy duck, and a beef dish... I believe it was the Pad Prik Sod (Choice of meat sautéed with bell peppers, fresh chili pepper, & onions). we all also ordered the Thai Iced Tea which is delicious and highly recommended. I love that you can really taste the tea flavor yet it was still sweet and creamy. 

when the food came, we were all ready to chow down. they also gave us a basket of rice and said that if we needed more, we could just ask. the dishes seemed small but for some reason, we had a party of 8 and were still not able to finish all the food. everything was amazing and tasted super fresh. I would definitely recommend the garlic prawns and any dish with the crispy duck. 

of course we all wanted to get a dessert before we left so we ordered one mango sticky rice to share amongst us. the mango was so ripe and sweet. the coconut sticky rice was perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of sweet coconutty aroma to balance out the mango. i normally dont like sticky rice desserts but I can definitely come back for this one! 

overall, amazing food, great service, nice atmosphere. the restaurant looks deserted in the middle of an empty plaza if you arrive early, but don't judge a book by it's cover!

we were visiting from seattle and a friend told us to try this place and i'm so happy we made it. it's worth the rip off of the strip if you a on vacation. EAT HERE. i love thai food and eat it a lot, but lotus offers more unique and northern thai food than i have ever seen in one palce. the food was off the charts- we had a deepfierd rice with pickled sausage and mint appitizer followed by a few recomendatinos from our server which included some of the best cooked duck i have ever had in spicy thai basil sauce. i'll also love this palce for the rest of my life because they have such an amazingly extensive and affordable wine list. i was finally able to try a very specfic bottle of german riesling that i have never been able to afford anywhere else.

My friend and I were in Vegas for 6 days for a conference and planned to come here for lunch on our last day. During lunch hours, they serve a buffet. I'm not sure what kind of food was in the buffet but it seemed very popular. We ordered off the menu and got the Nao Kao Tod, Tom Kah Kai, Garlic Prawns, and Roasted Duck Curry. You could adjust the spiciness for each dish. They go from scale 1-10. We decided on going with 5 for all the spicy dishes. The food took a while to come out but we didn't mind since we did come during the lunch rush. The Nao Kao Tod came first and it was a very interesting crispy rice salad. It was slightly tangy and when you eat it with the cabbage provided, it's the perfect blend of crunchy, zesty, and freshness. I have never had anything like this so I truly enjoyed it! The Tom Kah Kai came out next and this was probably my least favorite dish. I felt like the taste was off, maybe too much coconut milk? I've had better elsewhere. The Garlic Prawns were SO good! A bit pricey compared to the other dishes but the prawns were very big and juicy and were fried to perfection. The seasoning on the prawns was so delicious! The curry was the best I've ever had. The flavors were there and the duck was roasted to the perfect consistency and meshed so well with the curry. Service was great! All the waiters made sure our water glasses were full and always checked up on us. This place is definitely a spot I would need to visit everytime I'm in Vegas.

This is a small restaurant located in the Commercial Center (doesn't look like much outside, I know), but so many regulars come here, so this is a busy lunch buffet. On the walls are framed pictures of the owner\/cook with various people (Mayor Oscar Goodman is one of them), as well as notable articles of recognition- numerous ""best of"" and such. 

You pay at the door, before getting seated. If there are already a number of diners in the restaurant, it could be a few minutes- but not more than 15 minutes. Service is pretty good. Drink orders are filled right away. The dirty plates are taken off your table pretty quickly. 

The buffet is not large, but it is high-quality. The yellow curry with tender chunks of potato and chicken is my husband's favorite- he said that he could drink the sauce with a straw. There are two or three stir fried dishes with a good mix of noodles, vegetables and chicken.

My experience today was not much better than the one I wrote about then. I ended up paying $14 for a ""buffet"" , cough, cough, that was absolutely pathetic. The Tom Kha soup was ok but nothing special. 6 or 7 egg rolls would be brought out then vanish leaving an empty tray. The garlic wings looked like something left too long under the heat lamps, and then I had the Chili Mint Chicken with excessive squash or whatever the heck it was. I never thought a Thai place could massacre a dish such as Chili Mint Chicken but LOS has found a way to do it. To call this a ""buffet"" is doing the word a great disservice. I'm not expecting a spread the size of the Bacchanal buffet, but this...this is freakin ridiculous with what they're trying to pass off as a lunch buffet. 

Seriously for the price and especially on quality and taste Komol across the parking lot kicks LOS's derriere. If you think this is the best Thai food found in Vegas, you seriously need to pull out your Yelp app on your phone and do a little exploring. Coming here for a good lunch is the equivalent of a sucker's bet....pay out the nose, and get less in return. 

I can't give them anything more than 1 Star. My conscience is screaming at me for even giving them that, but fortunately Yelp says I have to give them something so that quiets my conscience a little. Now to find some Pepto to quiet my grumbling and very unhappy stomach..... 

By the way after rereading my old review...I stand by it. Still valid. And the one before that. Still valid. Notice the 1 Star pattern? Don't say I didn't try and warn ya. 

Tip: The closest place to buy Pepto is CVS which is at 2735 South Maryland Parkway, if you know the back way out of the parking lot you can get your relief in under 10 min from the turn of the car key to the swipe of your debit card. Trust me...someone will value this tip soon enough.",4,12,3

It was the most amazing food ever.

It sounds very basic and expected, but the Wor Wonton Soup was my favorite. It was perfect. I didn't touch it for a while because the steam coming off of the top was like a warning sign. The broth, the dumplings, the chicken - absolute perfection.

Prawn in a blanket - a must have when eating here.

The Pad Thai was like gourmet Pad Thai. Not the traditional flat linguini-like noodles I'm used to. Everything was perfect. A good amount of egg, which is always a plus.

I didn't have enough room for dessert, but they all sounded wonderful.

I was usually deterred because I never really frequent the area it is in and I heard the wait to get a table there can be atrociously long (my friend once was told a 2 hour wait for a table of 5).  I even tried calling to make reservations a few different times and each time they were booked solid days in advance.  I finally buckled down and mentally prepared myself for a long wait.  The area it is located in isn't the nicest part of town and the outside of the restaurant is really unassuming.  I'm pretty sure there were a few people turning tricks in or near the parking lot but anyways...when my friend and I arrived at around 6 pm on a Saturday night we were both so surprised to be seated right away!  

The inside of the restaurant is clean and actually quite large and nicely decorated with a large wine cellar you can look into through the glass walls. The service was friendly and helpful when giving recommendations too.   

What we ordered:
-Crispy Duck with the Panang Curry ($27.95) - Not going to lie when I saw the price of this dish I was a little thrown off by it, I guess it's because I'm so used to cheap prices for other Thai dishes at other places.  I ended up biting the bullet and ordering anyways and I'm glad I did!  The curry had a nice kick to it (you can modify spicy level of your dish on a scale of 1-10) very flavorful, but the main star of the dish was the duck.  The duck had a nice crispy skin on the top and the meat was nice and juicy.  My friend I was with never had duck before and tried it and he really enjoyed it to.
-Yellow Curry with Chicken ($10.95) - I honestly was so enamored with my crispy duck that I didn't have any of my friend's yellow curry.  He said it was good though and enjoyed it. 

I will definitely be back to try their other dishes, I'll probably make a reservation way in advance to avoid my wait time anxiety though.",2,1,1

Now how do you rate a thai restuarant that is known for well northern thai food and not ""thai"" food? do i rate it by what everyone is rating it, how can i when they aren't known for their pad thai or pad se ew which is some of my favorite dishes at my favorite thai restaurants. First lets start with atmosphere, the place is way down the strip where i don't normally roam. Located in a huge ass parking lot which looks like a strip mall is this gem in what is or was old vegas. Inside this dead looking place its packed, like i had to push my way through the front (lunch time) to put my name down on this long ass waiting list. Hit the bar in the restaurant where we were given a thick ass drink menu i mean thick!! stuck to the basics thai chang beer but for this place being packed we were seated fairly quick 20min at most. Now to the food... got the northern style food and with nothing to compare this restaurant to I'm going by my experience with curries and asian dishes. Started with crispy rice, the fried duck pannang and the garlic fried shrimp... one word AMAZING!! the crisp rice was good but very heavy on the lemon grass which over powered the dish but was still good. The crispy duck was my favorite, now if you have ever tried duck you know that well most places do not know how to cook it and being Chinese decent we know our duck and well so does lotus of siam, cooked perfectly crispy still even when submerged in curry! next the fried garlic shrimp mmmmm, deep fried and very tasty. The service here was on point and when i mean on point, full waters, back to back beers and fast check turn around. Overall I'm a fan for a very delicious meal, yeah i cant base it for any other northern thai restaurant but as far as taste goes this place is amazing and i will be back thank you Anthony bourdain",0,1,1

I tried the pad thai, and it was deeeelish. The noodles were cooked just right, and the seasoning was spot on. The freshness of the mung beans was beyond reproach, and the flourish with the peanuts would have made Michelangelo weep. I mean, this isn't as good as any pancit, but it was good for Thai food.
Have I spoken about the duck curry? Spiced to my liking, since my constitution is vey delicate, dearest reader. And with the accompanying noodles, elevated these simple ingredients to a paragon of poultry paradise. And the best part of all is the skin, which was very crispy. Not as crispy and delicious as lechon, but that's comparing pig skin and duck skin, and there's no comparison (since pig skin is infinitely more deeeelish.)",0,0,0

Reservations are highly recommended! I made reservations for 2 a few weeks in advance, and they actually said that my first choice for time was unavailable. When i got the restaurant, a few parties of 2 walked in and were told that the wait was 45 minutes (!?). 

The service was prompt and the menu is overwhelming! I liked that they have Isaan food. However, I think that I may have ordered the wrong thing...I was intrigued by the jack fruit curry, but it was ok...It was really watery and more like tomato water with herbs :( The drunken noodles were ok. The crispy duck on top was really good, though, which sort of made the dish, but the noodles on their own were average. 

I do have to say that the crispy rice dish, though, was FANTASTIC! Very flavorful, in all the right ways. 

They say that it's spicy. I got a 3 (out of 10). I can handle spicy food, but they warned us that 3 or 4 packed a lot of heat. The crispy rice was spicy, but the drunken noodles and jack fruit curry could have had a bit more spiciness.",0,0,0

1.  If the restaurant closes at 10pm, and you can still roll in at 9:55pm for a meal - Good.  The service is still excellent - Better.  The quality of the food is still exceptional - Best.  Lotus is tops on all three accounts!

2.  Wine List and Pairing.  Not only does Lotus have an outstanding wine list, it has the largest selection of German Whites in any restaurant - in the world, if memory serves.  Also, any restaurant whose wait staff knows wine enough to pair with my meal makes me happy.  However, despite the large number of Sommeliers and wannabes in Las Vegas, I rarely find a member of the general wait staff who can confidently assign a wine to my meal without looking at the price or without pairing  by color.

3.  Of course, the food!  I know that I've enjoyed a Larb Salad in another place better, but not an entire Thai meal.  To start, three of us ordered the Hot Pot-sized Thom Kha Kai, a wonderful coconut and lime-based soup with mushrooms and chicken, which was simply pleasing.  It was creamy, tart, sweet and savory; so perfectly balanced that it could have easily satisfied me as a main course.  Next, a Larb Salad (Chicken).  This could have been better to my taste, but was well-seasoned with mint and onions and very aromatic.  Finally, the main course - Nua Yang Panang.  I love Panang curries, and this one, with its embellishment of cognac, was one of the best I've ever had.  The sauce was so good my friends and I made balls of rice to sop up every last bit - the dishwasher got off easy with us!

4.  Price.  Yes, you can spend (and maybe should spend :)) $30-40\/ person at Lotus of Siam.  Yes, you can probably make decent curries at home now without the time and expense thanks to the plethora of bottled Thai sauces - think Heinz 57 of Thai...blegh!  But the total bill for all of us including my $10 glass of Piesporter, the menu listed in #3 and another's fried rice, just cleared $60 with tax.  That's right folks $15 a person!  Can you eat at any other of the World's 100 Best Restaurants at dinner for $15?  I think I hear Thomas Keller laughing...nervously...

Bottom line:  Well, worth the drive from anywhere for the excellent quality, selection and service.  A super way to dine at one of the World's Best!",2,2,2

When you get inside the restaurant, they have a bunch of magazine and newspaper clippings plastered on their walls, prestigious awards (James Beard), and countless photos of celebrities and world renowned chefs. You would think that it would just be the best Thai food you will ever eat outside of Thailand (which I haven't had the pleasure of visiting, yet)?

I have a feeling it's because there aren't much options for Thai cuisine in the neighborhood that they give this place such distinction. I've had better Thai food in Los Angeles (Thai Town) and there is no shortage of Thai restaurants in LA.

Overall, I am sad that it did not live up to the hype. I'll give this place another visit in the future and see if I have a better things to say next time.",5,3,2

I was encouraged by the likes of Ryan D. and new acquaintances at Khoury's to give the ""best"" Thai restaurant in Vegas another chance.  So I made my third visit.  Today, Lotus redeemed a star.  However, I am sorry to say that its still overrated and I doubt I will return for a fourth visit.  We had the roast duck curry, the green curry with beef, and the pad see ew.

My favorite was the roast duck curry.  This is the dish that has inspired other restaurants like Thai BBQ and Stick E Rice to make the Americanized red curry with cherry tomatoes, grapes, and pineapples.  I think they both do it better.  The curry was sweet, but had some flavor to back it up.  The portion was ridiculously small, and the duck meat, while good quality, was skimpy.  This is an above average, Americanized duck curry that I guess I would recommend if you aren't familiar with authentic Thai food.

Next up was the pad see ew with pork.  The pork was a bit tough, but nothing to complain about.  What little Chinese broccoli there was in this dish, wasn't rotten this time, so that was a plus.  This is a very saucy pad see ew, and sweetened.  Good for the general public, I suppose.  Not a bad dish, but I prefer a drier pad see ew.  You can get a much better version of this next door at Komol with huge portions of fresh Chinese broccoli.

And on to today's joke, the green curry.  This is one of the weaker green curries I have had. The beef was a little on the tough side.  There was potential with well balanced and interesting spices in the curry, but the curry itself lacked any real backbone or character.  It was quite watery in taste.  I had to add chili powder to make it enjoyable.  If you are a fan of green curry, you might want to skip this one.  Again, the portion was small.  

As with most Americanized Thai restaurants, don't be afraid to order really spicy to have a bit of heat.  I could eat a 10 here and not break a sweat.

LoS gains a star for not having rotten Chinese broccoli, and taking that terrible Northern Red Curry off of their new menu.  Unfortunately, this place is still on the bottom of my list as far as Thai restaurants in Vegas go.",3,2,1

I guess I went to Lotus of Siam expecting something magnificent, to only be disappointed by a dinner of mediocrity. 

Having heard about Lotus of Siam and read the numerous glowing reviews on the internet, I had thought that we were going to be experiencing an orgasmic meal of mammoth proportions. Some of the reviews had proclaimed that Lotus of Siam was the best Thai restaurant on the West Coast. But I beg to differ. 

The food was mildly good. The restaurant itself was very bland, shoved away in a bleak strip mall in the dark corners of Las Vegas. Walking up to the restaurant, we had high expectations, but those were soured when we entered. The walls were overflowing with numerous accolades and yellowing newspaper clippings declaring the success and importance of the restaurant. OK so that was a good sign. Contrary to the restaurant's proclamation that there were no open seats, the supposed ""packed"" restaurant was dotted with a few parties and looked quite spare.

So we sat down in a booth towards the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen and ordered a few bottles of sake. After being provided with our small bottles of sake and menus, we began ordering. A lady came by our table, the owner I guess, and tried to push a fried fish on us stating that we would like it. In fact, most of the night the servers tried telling us what we would like and not like suspecting us to be ""virgin"" Thai food eaters. 

The food came out in a somewhat fast progression, coupled with more bottles of sake. By that time we were feeling a wee bit of the sake, but the food kept us in reality as it did not conjure orgasmic feelings. In fact the food itself was quite unsettling, with very little flavor. By that time the owner had tried pushing the fried fish on us four times, we still did not budge. 

Leaving Lotus of Siam, we realized how spoiled we had become. Thai Nakorn was still the champion and Lotus proved to be an unworthy opponent.",5,1,4

We were there 15min after it opened, but had over an hour wait for a table of two.  It was a real test of will power that we stayed since we had not eaten a meal today and had hiked through the Valley of Fire.  So by the time we sat down, we were ready to order.  Luckily, things came out within 10min of ordering.  Actually, we were sat in view of the kitchen and got to see Saipan herself run the kitchen.  She really does everything...she ran my container of sticky rice out.  I thought it refreshing that she didn't feel herself too important for such a menial task.  I ordered mostly Northern Thai cuisine:  nam prik noom (spicy green chili veggie dip to be eaten with fresh veggies, pork rind, and my favorite, sticky rice), koi soi (thai beef tartare), a catfish dish, and (don't think this is issan) drunken noodle with soft crab.  Everything was good.  Thai food is known for is cacophony of seemingly unmatched flavors that come together harmoniously in the final dish.  It's an experience for your mouth.  We've been to the Northern area of Thailand, and it's very authenti...not that we need to tell you guys that.  Though my husband thought everything was just ok until we got to the final dish:  Pad Thai.  I know, right?  We're at a Northern Thai restaurant, and we order Pad Thai.  I read that it was good, and I wanted to compare this dish to others I've had.  Though I disagree with husband on this one, he said that he'd come back just for this dish.

We went for lunch.  The food was ok but not the best I've had.  We went with the buffet to have the opportunity to try new things.  It was ok.  Maybe only 1 item on the buffet had any protein in it; most everything else was noodles, rice, and vegetables only.

The food was just good\/average. We ordered the famous duck dish for $28. It was good. The duck was fried perfectly. My husband ordered it 5 out of 10 spicy and I think because of the coconut curry sauce, it should have been much spicier. 

We were worried to order it spicy because back east a 5\/10 spicy level is serious business at a few of our local restaurants. This was too mild. This dish would have been more balanced spicier.

I'm more a veggie-lover. So I ordered a broth curry with veggies and it was also too mild, I ordered it 6\/10.

Even our uber driver raved about this place on the car ride over. Her fav dish? A traditional choice of shrimp pad thai.

You wouldn't know it from the facade outside, but this place gleams. It's an understated glossy that made me feel sophisticated but not pretencious. Some blue lattice fencing strategically placed throughout the restaurant gave an air of privacy for the various sections of tables.

The servers are dressed sharp and they move quickly. They also love to make food recommendations. 

There is a whole room of wine shelves enclosed in a corner with glass walls. Patrons can see the room from their tables, so indulge in the vast wine list.

Two complaints:

I wish the curry was a little thicker in consistency. The taste was there. Spicy and sweet all at once, but it was a little thin for my liking. 

I also wish the serving of rice had been bigger. I had a lot of curry left in my bowl after finishing the chicken and veggies. I wanted to eat it with rice, but I didn't want to pay $3.25 for another bowl.

That being said, this place is really good.  To be fair I would probably say a 4.5, but there are somethings that could improve.   Definitely the best in LV that I've had, and I used to live here for part of my life.  I'm sure some people have had a bad experience for various reasons, but here's my take...

Good news:  Phad see ew, drunken noodles, and curry's are some of my favorite dishes.  Phad Thai is also good here (and I'm not even a big fan of that- we had fried tofu in ours- delicious!)  If you can handle the heat try the green papaya salad (som tom)-  It's a small serving but your mouth with be crying tears of joy and pain from all of the fire.  I wanted to try the beef salad but haven't had a chance yet.  I also love Thai deserts so Khao Neeo (sticky rice) with coconut and mangoes was good here (mangoes weren't super sweet, but weren't in season so not necessarily their fault).  

Bad news:  the area is sketchy, and there is really no way to make reservations (the email thing is useless), so show up before it opens if you have a large party to put your name on the list or be prepared to wait.  The portions are smaller, but everybody at our party was stuffed (party of 7) for only about $130 (no alcohol).  That's  deal for good food in my mind for Vegas.  So order tons of dishes and do what we do. . .share.  

Once your inside the service is good and the people are friendly.  

We usually make it a point to eat here when we are in town.

For my friends, the beef tongue was a favourite.  I see other reviews talk about the garlic prawns.  We didn't order that, but I would definitely try it next time!  While their coconut rice \/ ice cream dessert didn't sounds so special, I found it to be really tasty!

Compared to other thai resturants, I'm not sure if Lotus is so much better to warrant the 2x in cost \/ person.  Each dish wasn't that much more expensive, but I found the portions to be a little on the small side.

They have a huge glass wine cellar when you walk in and framed pictures hanging all over the walls of people who have eaten there. We were seated and serviced immediately, no wait. I asked the waiter what were popular dishes and he made recommendations,  mainly all under the ""Northern"" portion. I decided to order the Khao Soi with chicken and I'm glad I did. It was very delicious and had just the right spice to it. The chicken and noodles were cooked throughly and went perfect with the sauce. Only gripe is I wish it had more chicken and noodles because towards the end I had nothing but the sauce to eat however it was seasoned so good that I didn't mind slurping that alone. My friends ordered drunken noodles and thai tea and both of then said it was really good too. We ordered mango and sticky rice for dessert.  Although in our opinion it wasn't the best we had,  it was still good. As other reviews have mentioned, the portion size tends to be on the smaller side however we did not leave hungry either.

I've now come to this restaurant three times and its been hit or miss.  Sometimes I have a great meal and sometimes it's a mediocre meal at best.  

Some dishes that stick out in my mind:

Soups: I've had a few different soups, but they've all been really good.  When they ask you how hot you'd like it, from a scale of 1-10, they aren't messing around.  I had the 3 and was really feeeling the heat.  Don't take the heat for granted.

Crispy Sea Bass and Drunken Noodles: Waaaaay overpriced.  For $23, you'd expect a lot more.  What you get are a few small crispy fillets on top of a square chunk of chow fun noodles.  Nothing special for $23.

Garlic Prawns: I think these were around $20.  What I really like about these is that the skin is mostly peeled off and attached just at the base and they deep fry the whole thing.  The flavors are great and I highly recommend the dish...albeit a bit overpriced.  

They also have an extremely impressive wine list with like 7 pages of rieslings.

I like all the soups, but Tom Kah Kai is my favorite.  All the curries are superb, as are the noodle dishes (especially the drunken noodles with soft shell crab or prawns).

Think mild salsa is too ""spicy""
Think Pad Thai is basically the only thing to eat at a Thai restaurant
Are driving 100's of miles to eat here, and are usually surrounded by lots of good Thai food choices

Don't come here.


No seriously.

 If you like Pad Thai, great but lets be honest- most places make pretty good Pad Thai, and it would be hard to make it better than most of the 4 million other restaurants. 

 
If you:
Really love authentic Thai Food
Are adventurous and want to try new things without going to Thailand 

This is the place to go.     

Lotus of Siam is really good, not only for the quality of the food but the variety on the menu. If you are a stickler for quality curry, and like when you can tell from the color of the curry how hot it is. This is your place.",0,0,0

The downside is you end up spending more on wine than food ($120 for 2 people, including tip, at a restaurant where the average entree is $10. Huh???!).  I had drunken noodles with sea bass, which is apparently 3x as much as the drunken noodles on the menu.  Still though, the fish was fresh and delicious and the dish was great.   The beef jerky appetizer was nicely flavored but almost too tough to get my teeth through, however.  Finished the meal with an egg roll banana with  coconut of sorts, which was a nice light way to conclude.

Will go back here again, for sure!  The parking lot is sketchy, the strip mall is a dump, and the place itself wins no marks for decor.  But the food is great and attention to detail with serious wine is much appreciated (including by Robert Parker, who reviewed the place).  Although I'll probably order one of the cheaper $9 dishes.  Oh, and I dropped in on a Saturday night around 8 pm and had no problem getting a table.

***Updating my review after making 3 trips in total out here.***

So some of the dishes are quite average, the panang curry was pretty blah and bland, and the service can be so horrendous that you wonder if anyone is running the show.  The cashew chicken dish is just ok but again, about what I'd expect at an average Thai restaurant.  These people are seriously confused.  Lunchtime is a completely different scene (a 2-star one) compared to dinner (4 stars).

:: TO-GO ORDER EXPERIENCE ::

We were pressed for time and had decided to do To-Go pick up on a Sunday. Restaurant doesn't open until 5:30 PM but we called ahead anyways at 5:15 PM to give it a shot. Even though we were able to place our order they do tell you kitchen does not open until 5:30 PM. 
When we got to the restaurant (located in a pretty run down\/sketchy looking strip mall) there were already a line out the door!  

Entrance to the restaurant was so TINY -- to get in you pretty much have to go in a single file line (where there is alot of people). You also have to wait in the same line even for To-Go orders! Due to the mad line we didn't pick up our To-Go order until 5:50 PM. But the gal at the front counter was very nice.  Regardless, IMO they should have a separate To-Go line or something :P

:: RESTAURANT INTERIOR ::

The interior was pretty big! I couldn't even tell from the outside. Upon entrance into the establishment there is a wine cellar display and to the very right of the venue is a bar where patrons can wait for their table to be called. The atmosphere was nice and décor was decent. A say a bit to much celebrity photos covering the walls left & right. It's a very casual dining establishment & away from the glitz & glam of the Vegas strip. 

:: FOOD ::

Prices here are seriously a bit steep for Thai food.  But due to the hype we tried it out anyways. For AMAZING damn good food I'll pay for it -- of course when my wallet allows it :P

CRISPY DUCK W\/ PANANG  $24    (4.5\/5)
-- Portion kind of small for the price. Hence the minus 0.5 star. Duck was definitely crispy & there were no bones! The panang curry was delicious! But i wished they gave more tho :P 

SUA RONG HAI   $18   (3.5\/5)
-- Aka the ""Crying Tiger."" Generous charbroiled beef portion but something about the charbroiled taste of the beef was a little off\/different or maybe this is the true taste of a Crying Tiger? The home-made spicy sauce was not so bad but not much tang to it. 

CRAB FRIED RICE   $14   (2.5\/5)
-- There really were HARDLY any crab pieces in this fried rice. Tasted like regular fried rice. Definitely not worth the price. You're probs better off with the regular Thai fried rice for cheaper.

THAI ICED COFFEE   $2.50   (3\/5)
-- My taste bud didn't quite love it but found it not bad... something was lacking. Maybe it's just me?!",8,3,5

-parking: there's a big parking lot, but the plaza is big, but the restaurant was not easy to find. There's no sign, we had to drive around the bank to find it. It was a Christmas Eve, a lot of restaurant closed early, fortunately this one was still open. 
-waiting: checked with the receptionist, we were told that we needed to await at least 45 minutes to an hour. What a bad news. Then we started reading the menu, and when we looked around the restaurant, there were some empty tables, we guessed those for reservation only. Within 20 minutes, we were told that there's a table for us. 
-crab fried rice: it was good, but it's kinda cold, not hot enough. The crab meat was there, the portion was small, and we had to drink a lot of liquid after that. 
-Khoi soi- it was basically the crispy duck with some egg noodles, the curry source was thick, the egg noodles on the bottom soaked up the source and became soft and thicker. It was ok, the most unacceptable thing was this dish was warm only, we didn't enjoy this warm dish at all, maybe it would be good if its hot enough. After a 5 minutes, this warm dish became a cold dish. It seems the pre made those in the kitchen and to make it serve faster to the customers. We didn't want those kind of food with a high price at all. 
- garlic shrimp-- it was the only dish that we enjoyed. The shrimps were fresh and the way they deep fried those was perfectly right. The shrimp serve with shell, so pay attention when you bite onto it. The garlic was there, we had to put the garlic onto the shrimp to enhance the flavor. 
-service: its was good, the serve knew the menu well. So he took the orders right away.

Waited a while, with the employees not freaking about my friend's skull makeup and a male friend wearing short shorts, and were seated.  Not so much available for the vegetarians, and a lot of Thai places will specifically have a menu section for us herbivores, but not here.  Ended up picking yellow curry and some dish with flat noodles and fried tofu.

The curry was very very mild, and I'd wanted mild, but jeez.  You could've fed that to a baby.  Still good, though.  The noodles were great: tons of tofu, which wasn't in those chewy fried triangles you get so many places, and lots of crunchy fried garlic bits to accentuate everything.  My friends enjoyed their various dishes; one friend generally hates Thai food other than tom yum soup, but she liked that and the other stuff they got (fish, beef-stuffed drumsticks, and gross fried shrimp with their legs still on).

Our favorites: 

Crispy Rice (vegetarian style) -- truly amazing flavor, we could eat this all night. It actually paired very well with the

Papaya Salad (vegetarian version) -- delicious! Our only disappointment this most recent visit is we asked for Medium spicy and it was completely mild. 

Mangoes & Sticky Rice -- luscious perfection! Never disappoints. I've been experimenting with making my own but they really have it down. The crunchy fried mung beans on top are a crispy balance to the chewy rice and ripe mango, and I have no idea how to replicate those at home! 

I understand there are some low reviews from tourists visiting Vegas who may have had an uneven experience and felt disappointed, but as residents of Vegas who have dined here many times as well as at all the other Thai offerings in town, this place is the deal.

The place has a cramped entry room, filled with photocopies of magazine reviews taped on the wall. It's located in a dingy strip mall with some other international-looking restaurants (Indian, Korean) and a pool hall.

My only goal was to order things I'd never heard of and was sure I'd not find elsewhere. So, no pad thai or green curry for me here!

o Mashed Jackfruit and Pork salad. (They held the pork though, since she's veggie.) It was odd, and one of those things I could hardly classify as animal \/ vegetable \/ mineral. Like nothing else I'd had... kind of sweet, kind of planty, a little bit oily. Winner.

o I-ssam pork sausage. This was... well, just a pork sausage, cut up into parts. It came on a plate by itself, served next to a wedge of cabbage, some fried peanuts, hot peppers, and onion. I was expecting it to be in something, but I had ordered essentially at random, so I couldn't complain. I did get some tips on eating it afterwards from our very helpful server.

o Green Dip with Chile and Mushroom. This was a surprise. It was a small bowl of what tasted similar to Hatch-style green chiles, with mushrooms, in a vinegar & spice sauce, with carrots and cucumbers for dipping \/ scooping. Very southwesty... in fact, the sort of thing you might see on the menu at some creative Santa Fe café. Except it's a native northern Thai dish! Total winner.

None of these were mind-blowing dishes by themselves, but they were awesome in that they were different from anywhere else.

The habit started nine years ago, when I lived in Los Angeles and a drive to Thai town was only 10 minutes.  I cannot go more than a couple of days without getting Thai.  Any longer than that and symptoms such as sleeplessness, lack in work diligence, and even unnecessary irritation will begin.

Lotus of Siam is the Holy Grail for any Thai food addict.  It is the only Thai place outside of the native country and accepts credit cards that claims legions of Thai foodie fans, myself included.  I don't know if the legends are true about the former chef who cooked for Thai royalty.  Legends in this town often spread like wild fire, without true origins.  But Lotus of Siam is not a lie, because the food does not lie.

If you are a undiscriminating Thai food-eater, I don't recommend this place, especially if you've heard too much of its reputation.  Lotus of Siam's pad thai or curries do not taste that differently from Archi's or Pin Kaow, and you're guaranteed to pay more here.  But if you are missing those Bangkok street vendors and want a taste of Thailand in North America, this is where you go.

Here are some adventurous (but not risky) authentic Thai dishes to try at Lotus:

1.  Yum Tale (combination seafood salad): the seafood tastes as if Vegas was a beach town; for the price, I venture to say they don't fly in the seafood daily.  But the marinade and dressing highlight the best in what they have.

2.  Plar Dook O Cha (whole deep-fried cat fish): a traditional Thai classic that is a must-try here.  Although the whole fish (fins, head, eyes and all) may look foreign at first to non-Thai eaters; the crispy-on-the-outside and buttery-soft-on-the-inside is something catfish filets will never entirely own.  Lotus's lime juice & peanut\/cashew topping is as good as it gets.

3.  A Nua Dad Deaw (Beef Jerky Issan Style): deep-fried jerky that is salty and savory, perfect to pair with sticky rice and any of their salad.  Many restaurants outside of Thailand don't offer this, including all other Thai restaurants in Vegas.

4.  Khao Soi Braised Short Rib: Khao Soi is a type of Burmese-influenced Northern Thai egg noodles served in curry sauce and coconut cream.  You can order it with chicken or pork also.  But the short ribs are divine.  A very authentic dish that doesn't taste too foreign.

There are restaurants that are one-time affairs, restaurants that are seasonal flings, and restaurants that are long-term relationships.  Lotus of Siam is a relationship for me.  And one that I plan to document on Yelp as I write more updates about this favorite.",5,3,3

The minute my friend and I walked in to the restaurant after a long day of walking on Las Vegas Blvd, were surprised to see how big this place was inside. It was about 5:30 in the evening and half the tables were already taken. By the time we finished our dinner, an hour later, the restaurant was full. 

Inside, there is a room with a huge selection of wines. The two seating areas were nicely done, typical to most Thai restaurants. The menu had good selection of authentic Thai food and French\/American wine. The fried rice that I ordered with basil, tofu and vegetables was done right. The flavors were adequate and of good taste. Fried rolls for appetizer were standard fare but not too fried which is good. Just the right amount of crisp. The frozen banana dessert tasted good just like at most Thai restaurants.

There were so many enticing dishes on the menu but I did now have enough people to help me chow the food down.  These dishes will have to wait for me the next time I visit Vegas.

Our waters and teas were emptied out and he came around to fill them when we were done. Work on your service skills, you're in Las Vegas. Better service = bigger tips.

On the outside, this place looks like a true hole in the wall. On the inside, could use a little more remodeling\/repainting. Maybe some statues. The wine cellar is pretty cool though.

We ordered two dishes that everyone seems to be talking about: soft shell crab drunken noodles and garlic prawns.  The dishes came out very quick and efficient.  The drunken noodles was a disappointment because the noodles were lukewarm and clumped together.  The battered soft shell crab was warm and delicious but combine it with the noodles, it was not good.  

The crispy prawns, on the other hand, was astounding.  The garlic batter is insanely good.  The way they fry it is neat - the peel the shell off of the crab but not all the way, they leave the shell on connected at the tail and they fry the entire thing.  When it comes out, the jumbo prawns itself and the shell are fried.  You get a bit of calcium eating the shell.

For our main dish, I ordered the short rib curry noodles for my boyfriend and the pad-see-ew for myself. My favorite was the short rib curry noodles. I thought it would've tasted weird adding curry to noodles but the noodles were flat and light that it went well with the thick soupy sauce. The short rib was just so tender and it fell off my fork because the meat was so soft. I would definitely come here again the next time I come to Vegas.

Garlic prawns garlic prawns garlic prawns garlic prawns garlic prawns!! Did I also tell you to get their garlic prawns? They separate out the shell and then delicately deep-fry them both to perfection if deep-fried is a delicate technique at all. I have eaten at multiple places in Las Vegas but from this point on this is the one restaurant I will always be coming back to every time I visit the city. Also you have to get their duck curry the khao soi. Admittedly on my first bite of the curry while it was flavorful with the usual creaminess of a coconut-based curry, I did not know what the hype was. And then I took a bite of the duck and my whole world changed. Then i had the curry again and it completed  the entire picture. everyone tells you to get this on the menu and it definitely did not disappoint. I feel like these are items you cannot just find in any restaurant and this place does them extremely well. This is easily worth the trip not only for the quality of the food but because if you are going to be staying on the strip anyway you'll pay just as much for overpriced food and be missing out on authentic Thai land cuisine this place offers.

Mr. Tracy A. tried one of the northern Thai dishes with jack fruit -- a departure from what you usually see on a Thai menu. It was delicious, with a spicy tomato-y broth. I'm even willing to forgive them for making a mistake with our order, because they corrected it promptly and were very nice about the whole thing. I had a #55 -- I rarely order beef with Thai meals, but the flavors were so tempting that's what I had, and am glad I did.

I would award 4.5 stars if Yelp would let me. I must say that their Nam Sod wasn't as good as other times. (Plus, they couldn't get me a simple order of sticky rice to go with my Nam Sod. They were very, very busy that day since it was a holiday, Jan 2.) But their food is delicious, with a really wide range of menu options. I'd love to be having lunch there again right about now.

I finally made it back to Vegas for the upteenth time and remembered the review from Anthony Bourdain and recommendations from Zagat and Bon Appetite to try the northern style Thai food. Being new, our waitress made thoughtful suggestions as to what we should try. 

* Khao Soi - Crispy duck served on a bed of egg noodles in a curry sauce. This was the only true northern dish but it was the BEST dish ever!
* Nam Kao Tod - Crispy rice mixed with pork, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chilis, ginger, and lime juice. Normally with crushed peanuts but since I'm not a fan of nuts, I had them make it without.
* Papaya salad - green papaya, chili, tomato,mixed with lime juice, fish sauce and sugar. Again, no nuts please.
* Yum woon sen - Cellophane noodles, onions, with shrimp mixed with chili and lime juice served over a bed of greens. Tasty!

It's impossible for me to enjoy super spicy Thai food but I don't mind a small taste of it. Everything was ordered mild if possible.

Plan on trying something different. Go beyond the usual and please don't order the pad Thai. It might be good but after looking around, I noticed that there are so many other outstanding dishes.  Don't let the strip mall location deter you from visiting either. The food is fresh and it's huge inside. There's plenty of parking and they have an unbelievable selection of Riesling

Had the Chicken Pad Thai (spicy level 7\/10) and the Thai BBQ chicken.

Pad Thai was spicy! Just the way I like it. The noodles were nice and chewy, it came with the right amount of sprouts and other veggies to give it an interesting texture, and there was a good amount of chicken. Also had crushed peanuts on the side, which is a minor detail that I find lacking in some places. 

Thai BBQ chicken was delicious, it came with rice and a sweet-and-spicy sauce that I could honestly eat all day. The chicken was cooked nicely, it was tender and savory. 

Pretty conveniently located, it's about a 10 minute drive from Caesar's palace, where we stayed. I would recommend it heartily for anybody looking for drunchies :D

The decor is a marriage between the classic Italian restaurants in Chicago that adorn their wall with all the celebrities who have been there and a Classic Thai restaurant you would expect to find. A massive wine cellar in the dinning area adds a unique dimension. 

The service here is impeccable. Our server Somchai was extremely gracious, relaxed and accommodating body language.

We ordered some house favorites:
-Roasted duck curry
-Drunken noodles sea bass
-Drunken noodles chicken
-Kana Moo Krob (Stir-fried Chinese broccoli and crispy pork belly slices with oysterflavored sauce)
-Spicy catfish (Sautéed, deep fried thin catfish slices (deboned), in fresh and dried chilis and Thai basil leaves)

Everything was superb. It takes the cake for Thai food here!",5,0,3

However we have 2 different ways we order when visiting LOS. The first way is just me and my hubs on a casual weeknight, we tend to order the few dishes that we haven't tried yet . The other is a weekend night with several guests along for a Thai feast. So this review will focus on the later, a sort of best of LOS if you will.

On a side note you do not come here to order Pad Thai and the other super popular Thai dishes. LOS is famous for Northern style and Chef Chutima specialties, stick to those and you will not be disappointed. Also, LOS has 4 condiments but be sure to ask for all 4.. chili paste, chili powder, pickled jalapeño will be brought out in a caddy but the 4th is separate.. its thai chili in fish sauce and lime juice, you'll have to ask for this one. When they bring it lift the lid of carefully and inhale the fragrance. This to me is the LOS perfume and let me tell you this condiment is scorchingly hot. Its burns both ways but it tastes truly amazing! 

Apps..

#12 Stuffed Chicken Wings.. while these can be found elsewhere, the preparation here is a deep fried crunchy version that's amazing with pickled jalapeño and sticky rice. 

#13 A. Nua Dad Deaw which is Issan style beef jerky. Seriously, it's jerky so think deeply flavored slices of chewy meat. Its fun to eat especially with sticky rice and some of the accompanied sauce. 

#14 Nam Kao Tod.. this is like the premier LOS appetizer, if you can order only one app, make it this one. We call this one simply crispy rice with sour sausage. However its the little pieces of sausage arent sour but have a porky lime flavor thats addictive paired with fresh ginger, green onions, chili, peanuts and of course this is all nestled into a pile of light crispy rice. Served with cucumber chips this tastes great using the chili fish sauce condiment. BTW, if you prefer the sausage whole order #66.

Salads..

#45 Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad.. little deep friend pieces of cat fish with slices of apple and peanuts then dressed with lime juice.. Its bright, crispy and one of my favorites here. 

#59 Koi Soy.. okay so technically this isn't a salad but the coolness of this dish sits perfectly in the salad space for me. So what is it you ask? It's Issan style beef tartare. Yep raw beef and its a gorgeous dish with minced beef dressed with chili, rice powder and lime. We've ordered this at a spice level 4 and let me say that our faces felt like they were going to burn off. Order at a 1 spice level and add your own heat via condiments. Trust me on this.

Entrees..

A. Khao Soi.. typical street food noodle dish but the version here is crazy good. We always order beef with this but if you're feeling like a high roller get the beef short rib version (you'll pay more but its marginally more tender). Its simple, toothsome egg noodles afloat in a curried coconut bream broth garnished with red onion, lime and pickled cabbage. Its rich, thick and a must order. 

K. Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry).. this is one of those dishes that has a far reaching flavor profile. To me this curry could easily be on a table in India.. its dark deep pork richness is fork tender and perfect over steamed rice. However many prefer to eat this one with sticky rice. 

Drunken Noodles.. we order this a couple of different ways depending on what the table wants.. most popular way is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass with extra noodle. The sea bass is lightly dusted and deep fried until its light and crispy. Inside the meat is light, flakey and a great contrast to the rich smokey noodles. The other preparation for us is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Duck. Same as above but with slices of deep fried duck breast (no bones in either). The duck is rich, slightly fatty and bursting with flavor. For me the duck is my favorite preparation but I also like heavier meat flavors. 

Garlic Prawns.. so for the longest time we never ordered this dish as we thought it was just a Chinese style dish, boy were we wrong. This is where Chef Chutima works her Thai culinary magic. She takes large shell on shrimp and cooks them in such a way that the meat is tender and juicy while the shell is as light and crispy as a potato chip. Yes, you eat the shell, legs and all. This is truly a magical dish for us. 

Dessert.. 

We're usually so full right about now that desserts of sticky rice and mango seems just to heavy for us. Though look up my review for Luv-It Frozen Custard for a tongue cooling treat (its close to LOS).

At some point in the future I will write a companion review to this review for those who want to explore other dishes but have been overwhelmed with the scale of the menu. Oh and in case you're wondering the amount of dishes we ordered above are good for about 4-6 people. Though we're really big eaters so a party of 4 is more like it for us. 

Bon appetite!",35,10,15

Garlic Prawns-- so meaty and the fried skins super crispy!! (make sure you dip them into the duck curry)

So, after work on a Thursday, I hailed a cab and told him to rush me to Lotus of Siam. I told my server about my peanut allergy and told him to pick me out an appetizer and an entrée that would represent the best the restaurant had to offer. To start, I had prawns that were wrapped in bacon, fried (in what tasted almost like egg roll batter), and served with sweet and sour sauce. Meaty and full of flavor, I would definitely order them again. For my main course, I had the drunken noodles with sea bass--and oh my gawd, that stuff was incredible. The fish was lightly fried and crispy on the edges, but velvety smooth on the inside. The noodles were tender and intensely flavorful, especially when paired with the peppers and basil leaves that accompanied them. I asked for the dish medium spicy, and it was the perfect amount of heat--it challenged my palate, but it didn't obscure the wonderful flavor of the delicate fish.

2 thai teas - average
1 pad thai - really good, I was pleasantly surprised and the portions are ok
1 green chicken curry - the sauce is really thin and milky, definitely not enough meat or veggies in this dish
1 famous fried shrimp - this is probably my FAVORITE thing so far. The shrimp was crunchy and flavorful. Definitely worth the $15 price tag
1 ground pork with spices appetizer - probably the most disappointing. This dish was unusually sour, like so sour it was hard to even swallow it without a huge gulp of water.

Tom Kah Kai - The menu description listed straw mushrooms, we were disappointed when the soup arrived with regular button mushrooms. The chicken in the soup was dry from being in the soup too long. Minus one star.

Thum kah noon (pounded young jackfruit shredded) - We have never had jackfruit before. So this was a new dish for us. The meat was delicious with the rice. It would have made an awesome sloppy joe filling.

Nua Yum Katiem - Hidden spiciness in the cabbage in this dish. Mouth was burning, but we polished off the dish.

Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle - Delicious! The sea bass was deep fried and had great flavor.

The restaurant called a taxi after we finished dinner. A word of warning,  the location is off Strip, so it was impossible to get a taxi. We waited over 45 minutes for a taxi around 9:30pm. Minus one star. There were 3 other parties waiting outside for a taxi after us. We asked the restaurant to call again, and waited but still no taxis came (weekend of EDC).

I have been coming to this restaurant for years now. Almost 4x a year on my quarterly Vegas trips...but it had been awhile since I've been back. 

So on my last trip, I decided to reward my belly with the best Thai food ever. Call me crazy, but I totally don't remember Lotus of Siam tasting as good as it did the last time I went. 

I had a party of 4 and no reservations early Sunday night. Luckily there was room for us (typically if you have no reso, you can expect to eat dinner at 9pm..or never!). It's always a good sign to see other customers coming to eat at the restaurant via taxi with all of their luggage in tow. You know they mean business. 

We didn't order too much since we weren't that hungry. We had 2 soups (just cups) of the Tom Yum Kai and wonton soup. They were both great! We then ordered the green papaya salad, and weren't disappointed. It was so perfectly seasoned and refreshing. 

For our entrees we ordered the green curry (it had eggplant..yumm), pad thai and the best chinese broccoli w\/ fried pork belly I've ever had in the world. 

Why oh why is fried pork belly bad for you? Well, just for an hour forget about how unhealthy it is and just eat as much as you can!! The 4 of us were fighting over the last piece of crispy goodness. 

They expanded their dining area and even have a bar!! There are also 2 bathrooms for your enjoyment.

There are only 2 things I can complain about Lotus:
1. The portions are smaller than your usual Thai joint. So if we were really hungry, we would have had to have ordered 2 more entrees and 1 more salad for sure for our party of 4. 
2. Service was incredibly slow during our dinner. I'm not sure if this is normal, or if they're still adjusting to the new additional dining area, but we waited a long long time for our food. We had to ask our waiter 2x to check on it.

Most tourists enjoy it and are sold by the consistent TV plugs from Food Network and other social media.  If you talk to some locals, they'll talk about how overrated the food is.

I'm definitely a fan of Lotus but encourage you to branch out and order mainly from the Northern Thai section which is what separates this place from anywhere else.  

However the menu is like Cheesecake Factory with way to many selections which can be intimidating.  They should maybe provide pictures which would definitely help some of the novice Thai eaters.

Not only is this authentic Thai food, their selection is immense. Being my first time here I had a hard time deciding what to order, but going by other Yelper's reviews, I ordered:

- Nam Kao Tod (Appetizer): Selected 4 out of the 10 spiciness levels, seemed to be about right for me, but be wary, I saw some other tables sweating and downing drinks when they got too much spice.
- Tom Kah Kai (Soup): Delicious, it has coconut milk on it which gives it a unique flavor, definitely worth a try.
- Drunken Noodle Chicken & Pork Pad Se-Ew (Entrees): The noodles in both of this, out of this world. I personally likeD the Pork Pad Se-Ew better but they were both really good.
- Nam Prik Ong (Red chilli dip): Never had it before, interesting to try, but wouldn't put it on top of my list.
- Coconut ice cream with fried banana: I was so full I wasn't going to get dessert but other people were recommending it. It's definitely tasty, but I would rather save space for trying more dishes.

yes, the reviews are true, it's looks like a hole in the wall on the outside but once inside you will be immediately relieved.  hey, any restaurant that has a line of people outside waiting to get in has to be good, right? right!

we ordered 2 appetizers: garlic\/black pepper chicken wings and the tom yum kai soup (cup size).  wouldn't get the wings again because they weren't garlicky or peppery enough for us but they had a good crunchiness to them.  the soup was fantastic, i got it # 5 in spiciness and it definitely had a kick.  our 4 mains included: pad thai (chicken), we both agreed it was the best pad thai ever.  thai fried rice (chicken), we both agreed it was a little bland for fried rice and would not order it again.  green curry w\/chicken, it was very, very good and would certainly order it again.  garlic prawns that everyone raves about (i don't eat prawns but i made my husband order them) and he thought they were awesome, although a little pricey (21.95). 

we did not order any alcohol or dessert.  our bill came to about $68.00 before tip.  needless to say, we had leftovers to bring with us.

the service was friendly and FAST.  the waiters were very attentive at refilling our water glasses and clearing away our plates.

-Nam Kao Tod - Loved the crunchy pieces of rice though it was a very sour dish.  Size was average.
-Nam Prik Ong (Red Chili Dip) - This was not as spicy as it looked.  In fact, it was barely spicy.  It came with really fresh vegetables and pork rinds.  The dip itself tasted very similar to a spaghetti sauce to me.

Too full for desert so they gave us a scoop of homemade Coconut Ice Cream on the house.  There was also an appetizer of some sort of spicey Thai Chili Pepper rice.  Not great. The service was superb.

It's a nice spot if you wanna change things up or wanna save some money for the tables by dining off the strip.

I think I give it an extra star because if it wasn't for food TV and Lotus of Siam, I never would have known there was a Leatherby's there! God I miss Leatherby's..",3,2,3

If you are visiting Vegas, invest in the cab ride out to Lotus of Siam because it is worth it! They have many dishes that you would not find at any other Thai restaurant. Unfortunately, since there were only two of us, we were only able to partake of three dishes. One was the thai sausage (they have 2, we got the one in the back part of the menu). It was spiced unlike any other sausage we'd ever had and was very tasty. We ordered pork belly and chinese brocoli (gai lan) in oyster sauce. It was a simple dish made with very fresh ingredients. The last dish we tried was drunken noodle soft shelled crab. This dish was just very tasty. I had been concerned that the medium spicy sauce we had specified would overwhelm the crab, but it just complimented the crab perfectly. The service was terrific, relaxed, informative, and attentive. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice. It was full, but it did not feel rushed. I take off one star because of the decor. Once inside, I felt like I was in an Italian restaurant with a huge wine room. That said, I would come back again and again to work my way through their menu.",0,0,0

The girls and I went to Vegas (from LA) for a girls weekend and we wanted, no needed, Thai food. Hangovers you see. So, some Tom Kha Kai was not an option but a necessity. We asked the conceirge at our hotel where some good Thai places were and once he found out we had a car he told us to go here and I am now going to call The Rio to tell them that guys needs a raise! The guy said it was perhaps ""the best Thai food in the country"" and I sort of chuckled to myself because I KNOW the best Thai is in Norwalk at Renu Nekorn. What did he know? Ha!

When we got there I was ready to start talking sh#t because it was in some funky strip mall in BFE. But then I thought to myself, all the great local spots are in funky strip malls. So I wedged my way through the horde of people in the waiting area and saw the walls plastered with reviews from just about every news source you can think of. Thought it was a decent sign so I made our reservation and decided to wait the 25 minutes for a table.

As I stood by the wall my friend says to me, ""hey didn't you guys live in Norwalk? This says the chef is from Norwalk."" To my pleasant surprise the chef is the SAME EXACT chef from Renu Nekorn! How's that for a kick in the pants! Apparently he had enough of So Cal and moved to Vegas like every other person in the 702. I was even more excited to see that most of the items on the menu were identical to the menu from the Norwalk location. Happy day!

I can't even tell you what I ordered because I was in a food coma from start to finish. I left full, buzzed, and happy with money left in my pocket which is more than I can say for my departure from the rest of Vegas.

They also do take out so you can pre-order and get it to go. If you're staying on the strip there were plenty of cabs waiting outside to take people anywhere they wanted to go so don't fret if you want to venture out sans self-transportation. However you decide to get there - just go. Now.  I will absolutely go back the next time I'm in Vegas but this time I will do it with a reservation.",0,1,0

The restaurant looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, so I was concerned that I might have come to a bad area. There seemed to be enough other people standing around waiting for taxis that I wasn't too concerned (though I did keep looking around me as I walked to my car to make sure I was safe!)

Inside, the restaurant looks much nicer. There is a glass enclosed wine cellar in the background and photos of celebrities who have eaten there on the wall. 

Their menu is huge and I'm sure I didn't order the most adventuresome dishes since I wanted to be able to compare their dishes to ones I am familiar with. 

I went with my mom, who is gluten intolerant and also can't tolerate spicy food. The wait staff very courteously took note of her dietary restrictions and actually followed them (she sometimes will order food prepared ""mild"" from restaurants only to find it intolerably spicy to eat). I was pleasantly surprised about this since some restaurants with foreign (or even domestic, for that matter) cuisine don't understand when you make a request to prepare things gluten free. 

We had thai iced teas, green papaya salad, massaman curry, and mango with coconut sticky rice. All of the food was excellent. 

So in summary: you might get lost finding the place, but it is a good place to bring friends to with dietary restrictions. I don't think the food we tried was any more amazing than any other good Thai restaurant I've been to, but I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a good Thai restaurant with an extensive menu.",0,0,0

And I've had some good Thai food in Cali! 6 out of 5 stars, unofficially. The menu is HUGE, if only I could eventually get to every single one. That would be quite a feat...hmm...new blog ideas brewing. I had the very wonderful fortune of going with veterans of ordering at Lotus of Siam. I don't think I even opened the menu! They just knew exactly what to order, and I merely sat, anticipating each dish to enjoy.

In all seriousness, though...this place is beyond awesome. All the dishes we ordered were great! Make sure you know your spice levels. I LOVE spicy food, even if it hurts later. Just deal with it, folks.

My favorite: Tom Yum Kai -- the Tom Yum soup with chicken. WOW. It was the perfect amount of lemongrass and spice. I think by the end, it was a little spicy for us...but just make sure to pace yourself. I love putting some rice in my soup to help balance out the textures and also the spiciness. If you really like the lemongrass taste and the spice, get like a medium level spice (maybe something like a 5) and enjoy! This soup came out with the papaya salad (review of it down below), which was a little too much spice all at once. I saved some of my papaya salad to eat with the other dishes, since that's just a little too much spiciness to have together without anything else to balance it out.

What else we ordered (EVERYTHING was delicious):

Crispy duck: wow, it was very crispy and flavorful! Loved this dish, will definitely get it again next time. I see that a lot of people order this as a curry dish. I wonder if it makes a difference in the flavor of the duck itself, or even the curry itself? Well we had already ordered a separate curry noodle dish, so I guess I'm pretty happy with this choice. It keeps the integrity of the crunch and makes it crispy longer, that way. 

Garlic prawns: OK, so speaking of crispy. Holy Crispy Crunchy Crackling Goodness, Batman! Cap'n Crunch is put to shame. This is seriously one of the THE BEST crispy prawns I've had. I don't normally eat the shell of prawns, but I ate every tiny little crunchy bite of this prawn down to the tail. Oh my goodness, that's how good it is. Another great idea I had: make this into a bag of ""chips"" and I would buy the whole factory. For reals, though. Could someone please come up with that? It's nothing like the Shrimp flavored snacks that you find in Asian markets. This would have to replicate the crunch and flavor of this exact garlic prawn dish. Do it and let me know. 

Braised beef short ribs over noodles: I actually can't remember how this dish was...I think I was too busy with the other stuff above...Ooops. I guess I won't be ordering this dish next time LOL. 

Papaya Salad: I don't know why I'm adding this at the end, even though it was one of the first dishes that came out. It was really good and fresh, as far as papaya salads go. I feel like this dish was a little overpowered by all the other dishes, so I'm sorry that this became like the poor neglected pet who gets shoo-ed away when a new baby arrives in the family. 

I think I've written enough now. I hope you guys enjoy this place as much as I did! I really can't wait to go back...",3,4,1

My friend did the lunch buffet.  Everyday they have different food at the buffet and so many things to try!  She loved the egg (??) soup the best!

I ordered Chicken Pad Thai at 5 spice.  (I know, not very daring!) It was very good!  I felt a little rushed when trying to figure out what I wanted to eat, because their menu is HUGE!  Next time, I will check it out online before I go!

It was interesting sitting in there, mostly because there was some sort of wine convention or something going on and all the tables were filled with people drinking wine and on their laptops.  Very interesting.

The down side was the service.  We got there around 12pm and at 1:15pm we never saw anyone after they delivered my one plate of food.  So we found someone and asked for the bill.  Twice.  Then I paid cash.  And had to ask for my change.  Twice.

But it is overhyped and I don't think is really worth the drive out here unless you really don't have a good Thai place in your hometown.  I can name 3 in the Bay Area I think are just as good and or better, and two in the DC metro area that are up there too (places I used to live so there are more out there obviously).

Got here on a Saturday by 5:30 and there were a lot of people already here.  There was a large party that ordered a ton of food, so it took us about 30 minutes for me to get my cup of Tom Kha Khai.  It's good, but it tasted A LOT like plain ol' Tom Yum Soup with cream in it.  So it wasn't as special as I thought it would be.  Around 6:20, twenty minutes after my soup arrived, my entrees still weren't coming, and I had to catch a show at 7pm so we asked for it to go.  They were pretty quick after I asked for it to go, and extremely nice about it.  

We got the crispy duck with drunken noodles.  The crispy duck was very very good, but the drunken noodles were just meh.  I liked the chilis and peppers the crispy duck was fried with.  It reminds me of crispy fried pork chops at Chinese restaurants with the chilis, but it had this special brown sauce on it that made it sweet and extra good.  We also got the Khao Soi.  This was my favorite dish, but the portion was too small!

We also got Pad See Ew which was standard, and Massaman Curry which was good, but I actually felt was below standard.  I definitely didn't like that the potatoes were undercooked, and that there were boiled grape tomatoes in it.  My boyfriend also ordered chicken dumplings which were ALL RIGHT.  They were so tiny and it was $6 for 6 tiny ass little dumplings.  All in All we spent over $90 for thsi meal and thought it was kind of expensive, especially when we thought of our favorite Thai places from our hometown.  I think you can skip it if you've had good Thai food before.  The food on the strip isn't THAT terrible that you need to cab out here.",1,0,0

My years with Yelp gave them full trust to come to me with recommendations around the valley. On one of those nights, everyone was in the mood for Asian food, so I decided to take them here. I've taken food out of this place before but never really sat in and ordered. What a great opportunity!

This place is located in a very weird shopping center. Lots of different shops and bars, to say the least. There are a couple of gay bars, a swingers club and a lot of Asian food joints. Also remember that if you don't make reservations days before, they will not take reservations that day and you will have to wait. A long time. For a party of 10, we were quoted up to 2 hours and ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes. The waiting room is pretty tight but filled with awards, reassuring you that this place was going to be the bomb! The service was great. They were efficient, didn't say much, but got us what we needed in a quick timely manner. The place was a little drab. Dark carpets and wooden paneling made for an outdated look. The main focal point however, was a wall full of wine. An actual wine cabinet filled with hundreds of bottles. Super dramatic and awesome! There's also a bar down the ramp inside, so you can drink something while you wait for your table. 

For dinner, me and my party decided on the following:

Garlic Black Pepper Chicken Wings for $8.95: Wings seasoned with garlic, black pepper and other seasonings. The garlic was prominent in this dish and made the wings soo delicious. One of my favorite things that evening!

Moo Yang for $14.95. Marinated charbroiled pork served with spice sauce. This is always my go to dish. The pork chop was super tender, the sweet marinade and the sauce really seemed to enhance the dish. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this if you like pork.

Chicken Pad Se-ew for $9.95. Stir-fried wide rice noodles with eggs and Chinese broccoli with black soy sauce. This was the best Pad Se-ew I've ever had! The flat noodles were soft but not mushy, the sauce was mild and salty and really made that dish pop out!

Pork Drunken Noodles for $9.95. Pan fried flat rice noodle topped with, sautéed choice of meat with fresh & dry chili, Thai basil, served on beds of greens. I loved the basil in this dish. It brought a clean flavor to the overall taste. 

All dishes were served family style and was awesome! People always talk about this place as being great. You really need to try this out, for sure! I remember waiting in the front at the beginning of the night and everyone that kept coming in, made a comment like, ""this place is in a sketchy neighborhood, but trust me the food is out of this world.""

We ordered the basil and chili with sliced beef, spicy number 7, pad Thai with chicken, spicy level number 7, and musaman curry with chicken, spicy level 5. It is worth noting that the basil and chilli with sliced beef is exceptional. Reminds me of this wonderful restaurant called Tara Thai in Manhattan Beach, CA, when it was still owned and by Penn, who also was the cook. 

We arrived for lunch on a Friday at 1:30. Many of the tables were occupied, and because it is the number 1 rated restaurant in Las Vegas according to Yelp and Trip Advisor, I was happy to get a table right away. The server took the order after about 10 minutes which was fine since we were talking anyway. The portions are downright dainty. The pad Thai was burnt, and when we requested another plate that wasn't burnt, it was almost the same. 

Bottom line is that the pad Thai was downright awful, and the musaman curry was nothing exceptional. I felt incredibly full after sharing these 3 small entrees with someone. Shortly after leaving I felt incredibly bloated, achy, and like I took laughing gas. Called the restaurant to ask if they used MSG and they said they put it in every dish! 2 hours later my muscles ache, I feel sick and this top rated restaurant pretty much msg poisoned me.

Consider getting a reservation beforehand. Our group was lucky enough to be seated promptly, since we came in right at opening. The restaurant fills up very quickly.

Deep fried pork ribs (with sweet and sour sauce?): Excellent. You would think deep fried pork ribs would be dense and dry, but the meat was really soft, tender and juicy. Good amount of sauce to give the dish a lot of flavor--a flavor that everyone can like. The portion was great. Highly recommend.

Catfish salad (Plar Dook?): Very fresh and the deep fried catfish was delicious. Again full of flavor and fried nicely. Great starter. Recommend.

Drunken Noodles: Flavors on point and noodles cooked perfectly. Typical and safe noodle dish.

Penang Curry: Typical penang curry. Again, flavors on point. Can't go wrong.

Basil and Chili (With duck): The duck was wonderful. Crispy yet moist. Seasoned well and good portion. Recommend.

Overall, we were very satisfied with our experience here. Some of the dishes tasted the same as any other thai restaurants, and some were beyond that. What I did not like was that, when we were placing our order, with every dish we mentioned, the waitress recommended something else. I appreciated at first since every restaurant has something they're known for and something they're better at, and as a new customer, sometimes we come in not knowing what we should try. But after awhile, it was a tad bit annoying. She tried to have us order something different in place of every dish that we asked for.

Behind the nondescript entrance intoxicating aromas entice you with an overabundance of simple yet exquisite Thai cuisine dishes.  The impressive, reasonably priced wine selection would put a Cheshire grin on the portly mug of Bacchus himself.

Jonathan Gold - food writer\/ LA Times, said Lotus of Siam ""is the best Thai restaurant  in North America"".  I concur wholeheartedly.  Chef\/Owner, Saipin Chutima implements the finest quality ingredients and melds flavors reminiscent of my experience of true Thai cuisine.  Chef Chutima opened Renu Nakorn in Norwalk, California although has since sold to family members.    

My dining group and I were punctual for our dinner reservation (dinner reservations are highly recommended) and were promptly seated in full view of the acclaimed wine cellar collection. 

After perusing the vast menu and conferring with our waiter we methodically choose  dishes from various regions in Thailand.  We found the Northern region to be the most interesting.  Even with a filled to capacity restaurant our server delivered our food in a timely manner.  

A main staple in Asian cuisine, garlic prawns are deep fried in the shell and served with a pungent sweet-salty garlic sauce. The Soft Shell Crab salad combines fresh chiles, lime and peanuts.  The small crab, with a light and crispy outer shell was tender and moist inside - a crustacean lover's delight .  A popular Northern dish is the Nam Prik Noom - gently roasted sweet green chilies, fresh garlic and tomatoes are pounded to a flavorful pulp in a mortar and served with pieces of crackly pig skins and sticky rice.  We requested Chef kick up the Scoville units for some serious classic Thai chili heat.  The result, HOT and delicious.

After enjoying two bottles of crispy white wine and traditional Sticky Rice with Mango for dessert it was time for my satiated dining group to depart Lotus of Siam.  As I waited for our taxi to arrive I visualized future trips to the neglected shopping center where star Chef Saipin Chutima passionately awaits those who savor traditional Thai cuisine.",3,1,0

Papaya salad -I usually regret it every time I order papaya salad at Thai restaurants because the papaya is too hard, and flavor is nothing spectacular.  I just get tired of chewing it.  This papaya salad was the best I've had thus far.  The cabbage on the side helps to take away the monotony in texture.  We requested it to be spicy, and boy did they deliver!  Our mouths were on fire.  In a good way.

Duck noodle soup - I was pretty hungover after binging at the pool all afternoon, and in desperate need of soup.  This is my go-to hangover dish in LA at Rodded, and was ecstatic to find it on the menu.  False hope.  It looked the same.  Flavor? Not so much.  It was bland.  Didn't have enough of the tanginess.  

Pad see ew - We asked for it spicy again, and friends couldn't finish it.  Pad see ew is pad see ew.  

Ordered another entree, which I can't recall.  Obviously, it was nothing spectacular.  

Mango rice for dessert - First time trying this dish.  It doesn't taste as odd as I always imagined it would be.  The subtle sweetness of the mango was the perfect end to a meal.  I crave this.

Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab.  A good balance of sweet, sour, spicy, and salt, along with the fragrant basil.  The noodles were not overcooked, and the dish was well balanced. 

Crispy Duck Khao Soi.  The components of this dish by themselves wee not that remarkable.  Noodles that could be purchased at the 99 store (as I've done in the past), along with duck that has been crispy fried, and the curry.  However, blended together this dish was different, fun, and tasty.

This was dubbed as The Best Thai Restaurant in America (even the concierge at The Palazzo raved about this place) by Food Network, but alas! FN has failed me again. 

First, it's in a seedy area in Vegas.  Second, for a very 'famous' place, the waiting area barely fit 6 people.  It's hot in Vegas! Waiting outside feels like waiting in an oven.  Third, everything is wayyyy overpriced.  $25 for 4 pieces of mid-sized prawns.  Those prawns tasted superb but geez! 4 pieces?  Fourth, the service is mediocre.  They took forever to acknowledge us after we sat down and for drink refills.  

Other than the crispy fried prawns, the rest of our meal were just ok.  We ordered Pad Thai with shrimp& chicken (this is how we test new Thai restos we try, if you can't do this impressively then you fail as a Thai resto), Thai fried rice, and two other dishes I don't even remember (one was fish and the other was sautéed seafood with vegetables).  Our bill totaled way over $150.  $150 for 'just ok' is unacceptable.  

Compared to our fave Thai resto in San Francisco, this place is no match.  Like I said, I really wanted to like this place but as much as the chefs in FN and the concierge raved about it, it's just not that impressive.

The wait was about an hour but it wasn't too bad considering by the time we were leaving, there were still people waiting. Definitely make a reservation if you can! 

The restaurant is located in a somewhat empty plaza but when you enter the restaurant itself, it's a bit nicer. Service was good. They refilled my water without me having to ask and came to check up on us from time to time. 

We ordered: 

Crispy duck with Panang curry ($28) - basically fried duck in a red coconut curry sauce. This dish was a favorite of my boyfriend. The flavor was good and the crispness of the duck was a nice element with the curry. The duck itself was nothing special to me however. It was salty and without a lot of rice and curry, I wouldn't have eaten another bite. Probably would order the roasted duck with Panang curry next time, cheaper price for almost the same thing. 

Kha Soi ($10.95)- egg noodles in a coconut curry broth. I ended up ordering the beef to pair with the noodles. The noodle portion however, made me laugh. In one chopstick grab, I could hold all the noodles. Hilarious. The broth was even saltier than the duck. 

Garlic prawn ($28)- fried shrimp tossed in garlic and salt. Tastes exactly like it sounds. Nothing special. They separated the shell and the meat so one prawn looks especially big. Just ok. 


Overall, if I had just ordered regular Thai dishes, it would be okay, but for the price I paid for the garlic prawns and duck, it's way to overpriced. I can get a steak for that much. It's a nice run for your money. Not complaining though, it is Vegas after all.",0,0,0

He brought over the sommelier to help us find a wine that would go with our dishes. The Riesling was an absolute knockout and an astounding value at $38.

The waiter recommended the duck panang for my husband and drunken noodles with tofu for me. My husband was in love with his dish despite the fact that he usually is indifferent about duck. He said the crispy skin reminded him of cracklins, only better. I loved my drunken noodles too. The thick, wide rice noodles were drowning in a great brown sauce and topped with fried tofu and basil. We finished up with fried bananas and ice cream (the mango was unavailable). The server who brought it out instructed us on the best way to eat the dish, something I always appreciate.

A Fried rice, Panang Curry with Duck, Green Curry, and Beef Kha Soi later we were still unsatisfied, getting full - but the kind where the food hasn't hit the spot just yet.

15 minutes later and we were wishing we hadn't gone 20min off the strip. Yelp lost some believers that day. 

For dessert we ordered the fried bananas and mangos with sticky rice. Sticky rice had an after taste of some kind of tea. Dessert was good.

Most of the Yelp reviews here have painted a pretty decent picture of the pretty decent food at the restaurant, but a lot of them fail to acknowledge the decently high price you have to pay for their most famous dishes; the garlic prawns and crispy duck dishes are all nearly 30 dollars. And for the portion size of the duck, it is certainly significantly overpriced.

The food itself is almost as good as it is hyped up to be on Yelp, and it is probably better than your local Thai place unless you happen to live somewhere in Thailand. The curries and sauces are flavorful, as most Thai places generally make them, and this restaurant offers quite a vast menu with many Northern Thai options you don't often see elsewhere. A lot of people recommend the crispy rice appetizer, but to each their own, since I thought it tasted like salty and sour crispy rice that tasted probably just as good as my description. I don't drink personally, but there is a large selection of wine here, too.

The price was a bit higher than your average Thai meal, and the portions aren't especially generous. The rice is served in small bowls and is probably the weakest link at this restaurant. I'd say this restaurant falls into the common Yelped up restaurant category, serving good food at a slightly excessive price. This place is a solid four star place that is worth a couple of visits, but a far cry from a five star location that would be a regular in my book.",4,0,0

Craving Thai this is the place to go, they serve their meals hot and provide a strong variety in their menu.  They also provide northern Thai dishes which is not very common.

The first time I attempted to dine here I was told there was a 45 minute wait...that was on a Sunday at about 8:30 PM.  Not willing to wait that long I decided to try again the next day.  Wow am I glad I did.  This place looks a little run down and isn't in the greatest area of town but it's completely worth venturing out of your comfort zone for this place.  They must have a good thing going considering the wait times and it was PACKED both nights at off-peak times.

For dinner I had the Drunken Noodle Prawns and the Crispy Duck Panang Style.  The Drunken Noodle Prawns were amazing, that's all I can say.  I don't even know what the sauce and spices were but this dish blew me away.  The crispy duck was decent but I'm not a huge fan of duck to begin with...the red curry that it was with was some of the best curry I've ever tasted however. I will substitute the duck for chicken or beef next time and all will be well!  Service was great and very attentive. The waiter new the menu well, was prompt and the timing was spot on.

Definitively give this place a shot.  It's in the East Sahara and Maryland Parkway area and worth the drive from anywhere in town.",1,0,1

Ordered stuffed chicken wing . Chicken satay . Spicy fried rice with basil . Pad thai . And panang curry beef..
All the dishes were okay.. not awesome.. The problem was at the curry.. As shown in the picture there were almost no curry in there.. 5 spoons at most and I told the server I don't see any curry in there and he said that's how it is... I ordered curry not beef with curry sauce... mediocre taste and expensive portions small... guess that's what happens when you make too much money and busy.. lose quality..",0,0,0

I came here during a weekday so there was no wait, but still a lot of patrons! So be careful if you're going to come here during the weekend. By the way, don't let the outside fool you. It's pretty big inside!

The food here is so flavorful! The service is uhhhhmazing and if you're Asian, you know it's rare you get good service at Asian restaurants. We started off with the tom yum soup, level 6 spicy. The spice level would definitely go up next time. It has just the right hint of hot and sour. Next we got the pad thai which totally blew me away. Pad thai is something I always need to get at a Thai restaurant to compare and this dish surprised me with how good it tasted. The papaya salad was good, but nothing really special. Garlic prawns were huge and crispy and I could taste the slightest hint of garlic! I hate it when food items claim they have garlic in it but you can't taste it for shit. Next we got the drunken noodles w\/ soft shell crabs. MMMMMM, so gooood! Crabs was good and drunken noodles had the right amount of flavors. Last, we went with the mango sticky rice. The rice could be sweeter in my opinion but overall, not bad.

I love this place and would continue to come back when I'm in Vegas. Until then, I'll be dreaming about it.",0,1,1

A Thai restaurant which is pretty close to Stratosphere.  The inside is very large. There are pictures hanging on the wall w\/ celebrities such as Nicholas Cage, etc.  The bathrooms and inside are pretty clean.

The food is pretty solid.  Most dishes run at about $12-$15 each plate so it's much more expensive compared to LA prices.  I also prefer some of the Thai restaurants in LA but the food is still pretty good here.

Stuff that's really good - 4\/5
-Pad Thai - Pad Thai is solid.  It's not over the top sweet (I don't like super sweet Pad Thai).  Probably the second best Pad Thai I've had.
-Spicy Catfish Fillet (No bone) - I usually prefer the catfish w\/ bone-in, but this was a fillet.  It was surprisingly really good.  Nice crunchy texture and sauce was good.

Slightly above average - 3.5\/5
-Pad See Ew - Enjoyable.  It wasn't out of this world awesome but it's good.
-Panang Curry - Solid.  Beware, it's got a lot of coconut milk so in it, so I wouldn't recommend eating this before something sexy\/romantic like clubbing - lol.
-Tom Yum Seafood soup - Enjoyable.

Average - 3\/5 - All of this stuff was decent, but you can opt to pass on it if you fancy.
-Rad Na - Decent, but nothing special.
-Spicy Beef Noodle soup - In general, this is one of my favorite dishes to order at a Thai restaurant.  Unfortunately  this wasn't anything special (I didn't see any liver in it and I felt the soup base was a bit bland) 
-Skewers - Decent, but nothing special.  The peanut sauce was really good though.
-Spicy Sausage - Decent, but nothing special.

Bad - 2\/5 - 
-Crispy fried rice appetizer.  It's like I was eating Mexican fried rice due to the red onions and overloaded green onions\/cilantro.  I'm used to eating crispy fried rice but this tasted odd.

TIPS:
-Reservation necessary",0,1,1

You would never guess from the front of the building that this is such a large restaurant. Coming in, you pass a lot of signed 8 x 10 glossies, Wine Spectator awards, and other testaments to the quality of the food. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the service. We were seated at a table in a very large room that seemed to only have two waiters working the entire section. After 10 minutes of not being acknowledged (you know -- the not-making-eye-contact trick), I had to wave my arms to get some water and attention. By the reviews, this is obviously a very good restaurant. As for the food, the yellow curried chicken that I had was dry. My dining companion even said that it looked dry. The chicken looked like it had been boiled, shredded, and sprinkled with a curry sauce. There were a couple of what could only be described as chicken rinds on the plate. I get it. I probably came at the wrong time and ordered the wrong food. My bad. Would I come at dinner time and wait for hours for a table? I don't know.",2,0,1

Literally the best food I've had in Vegas so far, and I've been there 4 times and eaten at 2 Michelin star restaurants on\/around the Las Vegas strip. I first heard about this restaurant when I was looking for a place to eat something Asian and not-so-expensive in Vegas. I think this place was rated the #1 Thai place in America, and it certainly deserves that title. 

I will eat here every time I go to Vegas. The first time, we got the dry curried pork on glass noodles (I think), and the crispy duck. The second time, we got the crispy duck, chilean bass on drunken noodles, and the garlic prawns. I'm not a great writer so I'm not sure if I even have the words to describe how much happiness this restaurant has caused me. But just trust me. Everyone going to Vegas should skip the White Castle, the buffets (ok maybe not), the fancy steakhouses, the fancy sushi places, and make a beeline for this unassuming establishment in a very plain looking strip mall. Skip to the back of the menu where their special stuff is and expect to spend $20-30 per good dish to share with your friends over rice or some other side.

I try to tip well because the food is so good and the waiters that work here really earn their wages. Both times I've been here, they've been incredibly knowledgeable and excited about the food, and are very good at recommending things and dishes based on our preferences. The food also comes out decently fast and everyone who works here that we've run into has been attentive and very welcoming. 

This place is a must-try.",1,0,0

LOS served the best drunken noodles we have EVER had!  You must order the beef jerky type of app.  It was delicious and something that you could easily become addicted to.

First: avoid the soups, especially to go, but even fresh, I think both the Tom Yum and Tom Kha Ga were pretty disappointing.  Second, there's nothing particularly wrong with eating Phad Thai or other basic noodle dishes, even if I skip them in general, but it's a huge error here, there are so many things on the menu you cannot find elsewhere, you are really missing out.

Highlights:

Larb, sour crispy rice, drunken noodles (found the sea bass to be over cooked and disappointing, the rest of the proteins I've tried with it have been fine), panang curry (GET THE SHORT RIB), thai beef salad, pork blood soup.  

Keep in mind they have a pretty high heat tolerance, if you order something as a 5 on their 1-10 scale you will have quite a bit of heat, and I don't see a 10 as being enjoyable by any rational person including people who self-profess to never be able to get food hot enough.  I love spicy in general and wouldn't order anything much higher than a 6 or 7 here with the possible exception of the beef salad where the crisp vegetables compliment the heat very nicely.",2,1,1
