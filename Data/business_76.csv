This casino is nearly to Stratosphere. That is ok if you do not intend to leave the casino much. They do have a stop on the monorail. That does help you get around, especially if you are attending an event at the convention center.

I got a great rate considering how many conventions were in town. Parking was relatively easy. They need to add signs in the parking garage that do a better job of pointing you to the casino entrance and check in. Check in was quick and painless. The front desk employee was friendly and helpful.

My room was small. The couch is at the foot of the bed, facing the bed and there is just enough room to walk around the bed on all four sides. The rooms is very modern. The bed and couch are made of plastic and are topped with cushions\/mattresses. You can turn on a light the lights the bed frame or couch frame from the inside. It is amusing for a few seconds. The bed was comfortable enough and it faces the window. The downside to facing the window is that the tv is mounted on a wall to the side of the bed so watching tv in bed is annoying.

The bathroom sink is in the bedroom area behind the headboard of the bed. The toilet is to one side of it with its own sliding door. The shower is on the other side with a similar sliding door. It is an odd set up, but not a deal breaker.

There are several very good dining options inside the casino. This is a definite plus. I did not get a chance to gamble on this trip, so I cannot speak to the casino floor activity. The casino is good sized and looked well put together.

Overall this is an ok option if you intend to stay here the entire trip or if you invest in a monorail pass. If the price is right give it a try.",8,1,4

So, I cannot speak to the hotel, rooms, or service.  But, what I experienced was well below average for a large Strip hotel.  As we pulled up into the circle drive, we were approached by a guy directing traffic.  He asked us what we were doing there.  When we replied we had dinner reservations, he asked when, where, and for how many.  So, we told him.  He directed us to the valet area.  At the valet area, we were again asked the same questions, in addition to the name on the reservation by the valet attendant.  Now, I lived in Vegas nearly 9 years.  I've been to casinos on many occasions during busier times when the valet was full, or only open to hotel guests.  You know what they do in those situations?  They put up a sign indicating that the valet is full.  You don't get grilled by two separate employees at two separate points about your plans for entering the property.  I have no idea how full the valet was, but there were only a half dozen cars in the circle drive when we arrived.  So, I can't explain why we got the third degree from these guys, but it was annoying.  So, we had a bad taste in our mouths for SLS before we even walked through the door.

The décor is dark, sleek, and modern.  Almost too dark.  They had more than one $5 table available (never a good sign for a Saturday night on the Strip).  We decided to play a little before dinner.  I have to say, the chips were really cheap looking.  Probably the cheapest I've played with in a casino.  The dealer was friendly and knowledgeable about the game, and the cocktail waitress came around often enough.  So, no issues in that regard.  There was a large bar near the gaming pit, but we didn't drink there, so I don't know if the prices are any better or worse than a typical Strip property.  

 As we left dinner, we mostly encountered club goers waiting in line or preparing to wait in line.  The tables in this place were not crowded, so if you are looking to gamble, SLS would have been a good choice on Saturday night.  SLS has an interesting selection of restaurants, but my first time in the casino, I was not blown away.  That being said, I wouldn't rule out a return next time I'm in town.",5,1,1

The hotel has been completely remodeled and was very good. Customer service was good and hotels rooms were ok. There was some confusion on checking out on the Tv. I booked online and they wanted to charge me double from the hotel. Just pay attention to your bill when you check out. I will stay here again.",1,0,0

It's a small hotel, but the design is pretty modern. Also they have a variety of restaurants from cheaper ones to more upscale--so that was a plus since you don't have to go elsewhere to eat. That pretty much sums up the good things about this hotel.

Now as far as my grievances go, I have three main issues:

1. Wait time for the front desk is ridiculous. We had to wait a good 20-30 minutes before even getting to speak to the receptionist. They need to rethink of their system and maybe hire more staff for the front desk if need be.

2. Staff members are not friendly. They don't have a smile on their faces and just really makes the guest feel like they don't want to be there. It brings down the whole experience of those staying at the hotel and makes you not want to come back.

3. Lastly and MOST IMPORTANTLY: they had charged me twice for the room. Initially, when I booked the room online, I was already charged in full price. I was expecting upon check out to just be charged the resort fees, but again I was charged for the room fees. I had to call their accounting department and was asked to ""send them an e-mail of proof that I had paid full price."" This is a mistake that really should not be happening. When I had spoken initially to the front desk they had told me that I already paid in full price so I don't understand how it can be that I get charged again.

For a hotel that is just beginning to have their start in Las Vegas, this one is not starting off in the right track. Granted they are somewhat cheaper, but unfortunately it is true when they say, ""you get what you pay for."" Stay away and go to a different hotel, even if it means you have to dish out a little bit more money. At least you know you will get quality service that you are expecting when you stay at a hotel.",5,0,0

We booked a deal with flight for a Bachelorette party for a pretty good price. The check-in process was easy and no lines. Upon arriving in the room, we noticed it was very minimalist yet stylish. We liked the huge mirrors and the lighting concept. 

Unfortunately, after the first night, we experienced a severe smell of smoke and marijuana in our room. It seemed to be coming from the vent and we called the hotel to see what they could do about it. They said the only thing they could do is to send someone to filter the air for 4 hours and that's it. When we came back to the room, the room still smelled and it got worse through the night. They refused to change our rooms and we suffered through it. Thank goodness we weren't staying at the SLS for too long or else I may have had a severe allergic reaction to all the smoke. 

Will definitely never book at the SLS again.",4,2,0

Relative to the poor reviews, it seems they have worked on the S in their Service.  We asked for a dental kit - not only did it arrived in a mere 5 minutes but someone even called to double check it arrived - nice touch!  The restaurants are delicious if you're into SoCal food.  As for the Luxury, we stayed in a suite the Lux tower which does have its own complementary VIP lounge that has tea, coffee, snacks, etc which is nice but it's not as luxely stocked as the Aria Sky Suited lounge that serves champagne, wine and sweets like chocolate dipped strawberries and Pocky!  The suite was huge with an awesome shower but strange because it was relatively sparsely furnished for such a large room - I could have set up a tent with room to spare in the room.  The bed and sheets were indeed Lux as well.  Firm bed and super soft sheets.  So  why only 2-3 stars?  Because of the noise!! Good gosh - we were on a super floor and still couldn't escape the pool noise!!!  Day and night! So you're thinking its Vegas right?!  But there were mainly staff at the pool - it was pretty dead so why are they waking up the dead with so much bass?!? 

More gripes?  Wifi doesn't work well so I felt even more isolated than it's uber North position on the strip.  Some local reviewer claimed its not that far from the strip and there's a monorail - this is factual but can we agree taking the monorail in the sketchy  northern strip is not in tune with Lux?  Sorry SLS, you're just not cool enough to justify the price given the location. 

I wouldn't stay here again.  It's just too much of a hassle and not worth it.

Other gripes - super tiny gym (something I'd expect at an Aloft not somewhere that charges me a resort fee) and tiny pool (as part of their efforts to force people to pay extra and go to Foxtail).  

I'd probably overlook all the nit picking if I wasn't so cranky from poor sleep from the noise!!!! I had earplugs and it still didn't help.  I didn't book a hotel room so I couldn't sleep in it (even if it is Vegas!  Last time I looked, it was NYC that never sleeps!)",2,0,0

   This SLS just opened up in 2014 as part of the SLS micro chain from MIAMI
They jumped on HILTON's bandwagon and then in November 2015 they changed yet again to STARWOOD!
   Starwood thought hey, we have a cool property here....
LET's change it
So starting February 2016, the LUX tower will be converted to a W Hotel Tower (Hotel within a Hotel) opening before year end 2016.
The LUX tower was the BEST tower of the three of the SLS VEGAS
The other two towers are smaller and not as nice the WORLD and the micro roomed STORY

WARNING: DO NOT COME HERE withOUT a credit card. (in other worlds, DO NOT try to use CASH or DEBIT cards) They have some serious issues here with over authorizations that everyone complains about. My total bills was going to be under $200, but they made 5 (FIVE) yes 5, preauthorizations exceeding $650! EXCUSE ME? This is CRAZY 

being that I am Starwood GOLD, I was able to get upgraded to the best tower-LUX, but that will no longer be a part of the SLS coming soon, it'll be the ""W"", so I am not sure how good the SLS will be after loosing 1\/3 of their hotel and their best tower to the ""W""?",4,2,2

I am a local, so curious to see how the traffic fluctuates in the coming months.

Pros: 
I actually really liked the
Room. It was large with lots of amenities and free bottles of water. Our room was serviced once and I had no problems with the room. The food selections were okay... They need more casual food that can be taken to go. There's a coffee shop which is nice. The shuttle they have is
Free and takes you to either planet Hollywood shops or the airport and its free. We didn't use it because it comes on the top of the hour and we were impatient. 

Cons: 
It's very far away from anything. The cab ride will cost you about $ 13 one way not including tip. Uber is about $10. 
To me, it's more worth it to stay at the palms if you want to be ""off the strip"". Just weren't enough things to do in the hotel. Had
To go to the strip where there was more life. The worst part was that they double charged us for the resort fees so we had to call and have them refund. All Vegas hotels have resort fees so don't be mislead by others complaining.

The place looks really cool. It's going for what I can only summarize as a vintage modern look, and it's got a small shopping and eatery downstairs with its relatively small casino.  Right when you arrive, you'll notice color lit floor panels which can seem pretty cool.  You then walk in and see a bar with a massive TV screen hanging over it which seems pretty cool.  You walk past the exclusive pool club with the pretty girls and I guess that's pretty cool, and you walk by the concierge office which looks like a chic lounge which is pretty cool.  Then you check in, and walk to the elevator room FULL OF MIRRORS, which is pretty cool. Then you go into your room, which is SURROUNDED BY MIRRORS, which is pretty cool.

Then you stay there for the night, and everything that seemed pretty cool, turns out not to be at all.  (except the tv above the bar...that thing is still pretty cool.)  The whole place is a big club for twenty year old girls who want to get wasted and yell obscenities and think they're cute doing it.  The color lit floor panel at night doubles as a dance floor with a DJ and there were like 3 women dance on that floor(if it is a dance floor) and it looked sad.  The music was incredibly loud and I couldn't eat my pizza and talk on my phone simultaneously because it was that loud.  ALL the furniture, while visually attractive are horribly uncomfortable to sit in for a long period of time.  the 4 times I used the elevator, I got stuck holding the elevator for a group of twenty year old girls taking a selfie of themselves in front of the mirror room and then  crowd into the elevator talking at 5 million decibels in a tiny elevator. The mirror hotel room that I stayed in was frustrating because while my room mate was watching TV, it was impossible to read because even if I tried to cover the screen with my tablet, I can see the screen from every periphery....because mirrors.  Every light that was in that room seemed to be amplified four times because of mirrors.  

In summary, if you're a female, and you're twenty...and you like to annoy me in the elevator with talk of getting your hair wet and how that creep kept trying to buy you a drink and you like mirrors.  Consider this a 5 star review, because you'll love it...I for one don't really want to come back.

But it was a complete disappointment from the moment I checked in to the moment I left. It exudes ""cheap"" from the quality of the furniture (which was spare to begin with) to the off-putting wallpaper and decor. The employees seem to want to be ANYWHERE else and they were nothing but rude to me when I asked for anything. It's not the worst hotel one could stay at (it's clean and comfortable enough), but my expectations were very high and this hotel is totally off-brand for SLS, which mostly accounts for my poor review.
 
Some low-lights of this experience:

1) The bedframe is so big that it covers the outlets by the bed. I had a suite and had to charge my phone on the other side of the wall in the living room area. Someone skipped Hotel design 101. 

2) No bathtubs. What? The shower is massive... you could comfortably fit 5 people in it... but I was really disappointed by the lack of a bathtub after a long day on my feet working a tradeshow (made me really miss Cosmo's huge tubs)

3) The gym closes at 8PM. Why??? I didn't get a chance to even go in there due to the operating hours but a friend told me it was pretty shabby anyway.

4) The pool area is nice enough, but almost entirely in shade for most of the afternoon. If you try to pull a chair into a sunny spot, they won't let you because it's a fire hazard (???). The pool-side service is terrible and they ignored us the whole time.

5) Guest services? It's an oxymoron. The employees were so rude, and so put-upon when I asked for a hairdryer and a humidifier. I was cut off and had to call 3 times to get someone to help me. (Oh and the hairdryers are the cheapest ones money can buy and barely work).

6) The AC didn't work in my room when I checked in. They fixed it quickly enough but the last thing I wanted was a tech working in the room for an hour on valentine's day. 

7) Cleo was good, 800° was disgusting. Worst pizza I've ever had. Food options are pretty limited overall.

8) Taxi lines are very long

9) No energy in the place. The casino was sad and dead, and I was here during MAGIC so it should have been crowded.

I would have given this hotel no stars if not for the following:

1) MY driver Lazlo, how picked me up from the airport, was as nice as could be. Based on how he treated us, I assumed that my hotel stay would be fantastic. 

2) The robes in the rooms are truly out of this world. I wanted to wear one home. 

All in all, this hotel is this far away from everything and is not at all the luxury destination it claims to be. Service is poor and the ambiance is non-existent. Fine for 1 night, but pretty disappointing for a 5 night stay.",5,1,0

Never stayed at the SLS but when I get to Vegas pls know it was Bc of the customer service (to a non customer FOR a customer) that will get my future business.

My stay for this past weekend, I must say was terrible. From arrival to the time I checked out.
Here are some incidents that occurred that I find unacceptable. 

-Our party was yelled at a table game in the casino.
-My brother-in-law was called ""Son"" by one of the waitresses at the pool area. 
- Our check came and change was not given. We had to ask for it.
-The person who brought towels and shampoo to the room handed the towels but couldn't wait for us to grab the shampoo, instead he dropped it on the floor and left.

During checkout was where I was aggravated. I was overcharged by $125 and something change and had to keep going back and forth with the guy at the front desk. He was too lazy to calculate everything, I had to do the math on my end and he even asked me ""How much credit do you want then?"" 
I had confirmation that the 2 rooms were booked at the same rate. He kept telling me that it can't be the same. He said he would not honor my word if I don't have an email. I was having a hard time pulling up the email since I had no signal on my cell. I asked multiple times during a 40 minute period for him to pull it up on his end, he refused. I was finally able to pull up the confirmation email and he made the adjustment. He never apologize, also made mistakes on his end but not own up to them.

It does have a stocked bar, which is weighed. They neglect to tell you at the desk, that anything taken out to look at and is removed for 30 seconds or more you are charged for.

The very least they could have done was put a sign up that said ""Out of Order ."" Also only one cone in front of the door on the downstairs first floor, leads you to believe only one is not working. Also, the escalator to the monorail was broken. Whoa now that is not  fun flight of stairs to climb up or down. 

I also have to complain about the pool. First, the tiles in front of the entrance to the pool are slippery as heck.  I almost cracked my head open when I went for a quick ride lol, but seriously someone can really hurt themselves, especially with all the alcohol being purchased at the pool.  Second, we asked 3 different people for a server so we could order some food at the pool. After an hour of being told someone will be right over, we got out of the pool and left to go get some dinner. Third, not letting you take towels to the room after you are done is not cool.

I was a little worried because I had heard that the SLS was essentially a cover up of the old property. I understood the rooms were small so I booked online for 3 nights in the World Tower for the big fight weekend. 2 main entrances to the resort. Off the strip has you walk a little bit through the casino, past some of the restaurants and bar. The other off of Paradise Road towards the back of the property but closer to the guest towers.

One observation was when checking in, the piano bar directly across the front desk creates a lot of noise so it was a little hard to hear the staff member looking up our reservation. And since it was fight weekend, it was super crowded and all the rooms were pretty much taken so the request I had of a higher floor room was not fulfilled. The lady that checked us in was nice enough to give me a $50 food & beverage credit for my troubles. 

The room was on the 3rd floor so that was interesting. The hallways were quiet so it wasnt that. The alleyway or backside of the hotel where our lone window in the room faced had garbage trucks or the type pulling up and you could hear them. That wasnt my favorite although it wasnt for very long. The room itself was small but nice. White and black theme. Decor was modern with artistic touches on the walls, bathroom and headboard. Bed was comfortable, there's a nice white couch, desk, another upholstered chair and a silver tree stump. Haha...There were full length rectangular mirrors on both sides that were framed by light. I liked it... They looked great.

The bathroom was modern and was of a decent size. Nice big white sink and toiletries were of a good quality. Towels were soft. Sliding mirror door closure. Too bad no robes are provided. The TV was a nice clear and big sized Samsung LCD smartTV. I liked the room. It was small but it was nice and comfortable.

Valet was quick and efficient. Even though it was a super crowded weekend. We got our rental in a decent amount of time. Either give your ticket to someone at the valet stand or scan it and wait for your car past the taxi lanes by the benches. 

Didnt get to try the pool or clubs in the hotel. But Life seems like a happening spot. Maybe next time. Would I stay there again? Probably... But not on a big fight weekend. It's too crazy. The crowds are out of control. We have a friend that works there at one of the clubs and he even said that was a first for them. It's normally not that crazy... Good to know. Sucks for us.

I was so excited to make it to Vegas for the very first time and stay in what appeared to be a very plush and luxurious hotel. It was soon revealed to me upon first sight that it was not what it appeared to be.  

As the saying goes you can put lipstick on a pig but it is still a pig.  That is in essence what SLS is, a pig with lipstick. I stayed in what was called the ""Lux Tower.""  There was nothing luxurious about it.

The front desk personnel was not very sympathetic to a weary patron who lacked sleep and just wanted his room.   A demon of a man, Daniel Yoo, the Front Desk Supervisor, was the least professional of all.  Mr. Yoo, displeased with me going to a Manager of Operations at the hotel to complain, gave me the worst room in the ""Lux Tower.""  My only view of Vegas, from my room, was an old wall with a popcorn finish.

The hotel itself is dressed in very nice decor however it is only covering up very old bones.  The center elevator in the ""Lux Tower"" is a very rough ride that bounces as it goes up.  It really is an unpleasant experience to say the least.  They should honestly consider installing a roller coaster style constraint to make it safe to use.  

The bedding in my room was not changed every day.  I had to ask housekeeping to change the bedding.  When I returned to the room, I found the bed made but with my girlfriends make-up still on the pillow case. I guess fresh bedding was not an option.

I wish I could give the hotel a negative rating of five but that is not an option.  This hotel has recently been taken over by the W chain.  The W hotel chain has very nice properties. Th W hotel chain really has it's work cut out with the SLS.  I hope that their first course of action is changing the management.  That would really be a great start.  Additionally, the hotel needs improvement overall in the basic things such as housekeeping and customer service.  

The only bright spots to SLS were Cleo which is an amazing restaurant and should really be relocated.  Cleo is by far the best Mediterranean restaurant I have ever been to and I have been to many.   Additionally, the bartenders on the casino floor were very nice and made very good cocktails.  The servers in the Northside Cafe were also great.

I was really left unimpressed with Vegas.  I will give it a second try somewhere else and hope that this poor example of a hotel is not a representation of the whole strip.

If you are considering the SLS as an option do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  The SLS is quite frankly just dog poop on a stick. Hopefully, the change  to W will bring the much needed change.",2,0,0

I've not taken advantage of their amenities such as the pool area.

The restaurants seemed a bit lackluster, and in part maybe because I get a sense that the SLS has a ""Los Angeles Theme"" to the design, and being from the LA area, I don't have any desire to eat at Umami Burger (in LA at least, I find it to be over-rated) and then they have a Chinese (Ku Noodle) spot with menu items 2x the price and probably 1\/2 the portions of what you'd be able to get in the San Gabriel Valley or Chinatown, and then they have a Japanese (Katsuya) restaurant, a Steakhouse (Bazaar Meats), Pizzeria (800 Degrees) and some sort of comfort food (Northside Cafe) diner.  I can't really rate the restaurants other than from a lack of appeal standpoint, since I never tried 'em.  I was told they once had a buffet, but due to, I think lack of patronage (customer support) it closed down.

The room rates seems fair for Las Vegas and is in that middle layer.  It's not the $20-50 rooms you get a Circus Circus and the soon to be demolished Riviera; and it's also less than The Wynn, Encore, Palazzo and Venetian's $75-200+ rooms.  Prices vary based on the time of year, day of the week, promotional specials, etc. as well as if you go online to Expedia, Orbitz, Trip Advisor, etc. Generally it's on par with places like Treasure Island, Bally's, etc., but the rooms here are really nice, modern, new and up to date.

How I often rate rooms is by the shower. If a shower\/tub combo, I say ""nay"" if a stand-up shower, I say ""Yea"" - this has no bathtub, and a spacious shower in a rather large bathroom area.

The hotel staff are friendly and accommodating.

The location is, well... at the far end of the strip.  If you're going to the CONVENTION CENTER then this is probably one of the best hotels to stay in.  It's about a 10 minute walk or so, maybe a mile from the hotel to the convention center.  

If you like life on the Vegas Strip and to walk up and down to see the sights or troll for hookers late night, then this may not be a great place... even the prostitutes are too lazy to come this far out since their main bar area didn't seem to have much of that action... not that I was looking for it.  So, it's a more chilled out and relaxed environment, even the casino floor, which is spacious.  

I can't rate the casino other than saying I had bad luck and lost $60 in craps within minutes and it wasn't my night.  I placed some sports bets with ""futures"" wagers of some long shots, so that could be my saving grace at the end of the year if\/when the Atlanta Braves wins the 2015 World Series and I cash out on the 50:1 odds...

Overall, I'd return here and stay at the SLS if the room rates were competitive or lower to their peers.",11,5,6

Now I know what the SLS stands for - Shitty Lame Sucky.  I anticipated that it would be overcrowded and the staff overwhelmed, so that part did not bother me. But some other things...

How do you have all your elevators in your parking structure konk out simultaneously? Going up 6 flights of stairs in stifling Vegas heat is no one's idea of a picnic. I felt so bad for some of the disabled patrons that were huffing and cussing as they were climbing up the stairs. Couldn't they have at least provided a cart that would transport them to their car? The ADA is going to have a field day with this one.

The whole vibe they are going for is Industrial Chic.  You can see all of the air-conditioning ducting as it is just painted black. There is also a wall in the hotel that has graffiti all over it.  It looks like they couldn't decide what style they were going for so they just incorporated a bunch of them. Sure the place is easy to navigate...their gaming area is smaller than most Indian Casinos. I especially loved all of the broken bottles and vomit in the parking structure just left there from the night before. The carpet was shedding worse than a Persian cat.  There were so many fuzzballs all over the place, I thought someone's dryer trap exploded all over the casino floor.

The saving grace for the SLS is that it has some great restaurants - Katsuya, Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres, Umami, 800 Degrees, and Ku Noodle to name a few.

But time will tell if the establishment continues to wow or just mires itself in mediocrity due to its lack of attention to detail.",23,19,5

On the night of 8\/19\/2017 one of my family members was laying on the bed in room 14603 shortly before taking a shower and when he went to remove his sock, there was an adult bed bug - as seen in the pictures provided. We put it into a plastic bag and immediately called down to the front desk around 8:20pm. We spoke with the guest service representative and explained our issue, to which she replied there was nothing they could do. The line disconnected and we immediately received a phone call back and this time it was the inspector saying she was on her way up to our room. The inspector came in and looked at the bed bug we had collected and switched us to room 11411. The only compensation offered to us at that time was having the resort fees taken off, but when we checked out, the lady at the front desk still tried to charge us for it. Thankfully, she removed it without a fight, but we are still very disappointed with the stay here. This issue affected our entire vacation. We not only had to cut our stay short and pay additional fees to change our flights. 
 We also had to take extra precautionary measures to ensure we did not bring this issue home with us including bringing our clothes and baggage directly to a commercial laundry mat. 

 Luckily since I work for a pest control company, I have the knowledge to take the necessary steps to prevent further infestation, but I am disappointed that I even had to go through the stress of it all. We spoke with the general manager earlier today and was told that the room 14603 came back negative for bed bugs, despite the evidence we had bagged up. I'm not sure if they have a licensed pest control company that comes out to inspect these issues or if they do it themselves, but either way, it doesn't sound like it was inspected that thoroughly as again, we have bites and bagged evidence proving otherwise. All and all I'm very disappointed in my stay and would never come back or recommend family or friends to stay here!

I just finished checked out and I am writing this exceptional review standing next to the Marilyn Bubblegum artwork right by the check-in\/out counter.

CHECK-IN:

- We got in late (1am) but the check in lady Eunji was the sweetest - she got us the room we wanted on a booked night with a view of the strip - she made us feel very welcomed at 1am - and that was great enough for me to write a review on!

- We want to stress again that the service we received from Eunji was just incredible! Thank you!

ROOM:

- TAKE NOTE THAT You are NOT going to find spacious rooms here because SLS took over the Old SAHARA Casino's buildings, and none of the rooms have the size you would find at, say Bellagio or the crazy suites at Venetian\/Palazzo (which I always stay at).

- 4 of us stayed at the World Superior Double room - the only room that has two beds. It's a small room with two double beds - thankfully we are all skinny enough to sleep comfortably - the room is modern, with two LARGE mirrors. We couldn't get an extra roll out bed due to fire code (Room too small to have another bed), which is understandable seeing how small the room is (around 400sq ft I think).

BATHROOM:

- No bath tub, but the shower was really legit.
- No fridge in the room either but the TV is pretty big.

So take that into consideration if you want a fridge and a tub - you might want to call and ask them regarding to other room types.

ROOM SERVICE:

- One word: LightningSPEED! We asked for more towels over the phone... And within 2 minutes the towels were delivered to our room. We asked for towels again the next day, and the same speedy delivery was second to none. Never have I stayed at a LV hotel and get such prompt room service (usually it takes them 5-10minutes to deliver towels from past experiences).

- The housekeeping even sign their name on a small thank you card after they cleaned the room.

CHECK OUT:

- I think what SLS impressed me the most is not just the design that has the word STARCK painted all over the hotel (though the design is certainly impressive), but the PEOPLE working at the hotel are just SO helpful & approachable.

- The lady who helped me at check out, DEONDRA (I specifically remembered her name because it's real special), was just as exceptional - she didn't seem to be in any hurry to finish with my check out process though there's a line behind me waiting - She patiently listened to my questions regarding to various room types and explained why the rooms in the tree towers (Story, World, Lux) have the compact layouts & the differences between them - a great ending to our short trip - and we will definitely come back to stay at SLS again - thank you Deondra!

OVERALL +\/-

+ Service is exceptional!!
+ Newly renovated
+ Phillip Starck Design
+ Affordable (Great deal on their website)
+ EUNJI & DEONDRA

- No Tub or Fridge
- Regular rooms are a bit compact
(They do have suites in Lux Tower, however)

I still give it a 5 because their exceptional service outweighs the lack of space (you're there to rest that's all), tub (they've got a pool & the shower is fantastic), and fridge.

See you again very soon, SLS Las Vegas.",1,2,1

First of all, the elevators suck! There were only 4 in our wing and that's definitely not enough. We had to pass getting in many times because the elevator would be crammed full and we'd say ""Oh, it's fine. We'll catch the next one."" But the next one would be full too. With so many rooms and floors, they need more.  The decor in our room was pretty cool (very Instagram friendly), but as others have mentioned they replaced practicality with style. 

The bed was really comfortable! We slept great both nights. But the room had a really odd smell. I have to believe it was from the carpet or wallpaper. It smelled like industrial glue. And it never went away. Every time we walked back in, it was like BAM! Smelly!

As far as the location goes, it is far from everything even though it is technically on the strip. We knew that going in, but don't be mislead if this is your first time. If you want more of a ""Viva Las Vegas"" party all night feel, then you'll want to stay more south on the strip. For us, it was kind of nice to leave all the action and come back to our neck of the woods at the end of the night. The tram system is very convenient and we just paid for the 24 hour pass. It takes you to multiple stops on the strip and it was never too crowded.    

The SLS is probably not somewhere I'd stay again, but you could definitely find worse places to stay in Vegas.",1,0,0

When you drive up, there is no sign saying where to go or what to do. I called the hotel, the person who answered the phone was rude and hung up on me, but I gathered that what I had to do was go in the ramp that said ""Self Parking"", find a parking space, find the elevator (no signs for that either), go down to the ground floor, walk outside and around to the front, go in, dragging our suitcases up three steps (no ramp), then down three stairs on the other side of the door (no ramp). (The next day I found the ramp, but it wasn't obvious, and of course there was no sign. Inside there are no signs, just noisy slot machines. A ton of them. I found a bar and the barman pointed me in the right direction, though I had to ask someone else after walking part way. The registration desk has no sign over it at all. It is easily a city block to walk from the parking garage to the registration desk, and it requires you to walk the whole length of the casino to get there. Then you have to walk through the casino again to get out. 

The room was OK, in the World tower. At the foot of the bed was a sofa facing a large TV on the wall. No chairs except a very small and uncomfortable one at the ""desk"" in front of the TV. There were large mirrors on each side wall surrounded by fluorescent lights you turned on with a switch.

BUT, nowhere to unpack any clothes. If you remove things from minibar so as to put your own things in, you will be charged fot them even if you put thrm back unopened. Front desk took those charges off. Refrigerator is extra (none in room).",1,0,0

+ Very comfortable bed. I realize this is subjective, but I usually sleep on a Tempurpedic bed and spent over a week here with no back issues.
+ 24 hour room service. This is imperative for any business traveler. I've always placed my order with Beau, who is as attentive and helpful at 7:30 PM as he is at 1:00 AM. 
+ Average-to-good toiletry products. They also leave full-sized bottles so I don't have to ask for more shampoo every day. The provided lotion is the runny consistency of liquid hand soap, so I'd still bring my own to this arid town.
+ Humidifiers are available to check out with housekeeping. They are loud but get the job done. I suffered through the first 3 days without a humidifier and the difference is noticeable.
+ The monorail stop is attached to the property, so you can move around the Strip quickly and cheaply with a monorail pass. Passes are currently $5 for a single ride, $22 for two days, $56 for a week. 

+\/- Down pillows of two types, high and low. This is great for people who love a smushy pillow, but sucks for those of use who like firm neck support. Perhaps you can ask housekeeping for alternatives, I didn't try.
+\/- Front desk service is polarizing. I have received stupendous service (Marisa) and completely dismal, rude-adjacent service (Chris).

- No closet or drawers at all, even on your nightstand. There is a small 3 shelf unit in the entryway, but if you prefer your underthings to be tucked away in a private place, they'll have to stay in your luggage.
- Beds are right under a window, so the cold air creeps in over\/around the short headboard.
- No buffet and limited restaurants in general. Eating at a buffet is pretty high up on my list of Vegas priorities so this was really disappointing to me, but all five of the restaurants on-site (Bazaar Meat, Cleo, Katsuya, Ku Noodle, Northside Cafe) are quite small and it's impossible to get a quick reservation at a decent hour.
- Newfangled minibar has sensors so anything that is moved will be charged. There's also a $30 charge if you store your personal items in there.
- The Sayers Club is tiny with questionable music choices on a Saturday night. The DJ swung wildly between top 40s hits, EDM, and hiphop, intertwined with awkward transitions.",1,0,1

It was a very cute boutique hotel that is not extremely big but it has everything that is needed from a Vegas hotel (i guess the buffet was temporarily closed but im not a big fan of buffets anyway!) ...

Room- the room was very clean and super modern. The bed was incredibly comfy. i had read reviews that the rooms were a little small, but we stayed at a King room in the World Tower and it was pretty spacious for two people. I could see it being a little small for two full size beds and 4 people in the room, but it was perfect for 2! 

Casino- the casino was great, again not so BIG where you can't find your party but had a great variety of slot machines and tables with decent mins and maxs on the tables. 

People- the people were really nice to deal with. Did not have any issues there at all. 

Club- The Sayers Club is a MUST!! i lvoed it, great band and great music! Life-- not so great but the promoter that we dealt was was AWESOME!! Jerrell...he's great!! 

Everything else was really nice...the restaurants -- The Griddle Cafe-- was great for breakfast but a long line...Umami burger was great! Katsuya-- was just OK-- nothing spectacular for the price... didn't try Cleo at the SLS but had it in LA and it is pretty decent!

Almost none of the table games were open. None of the restaurants were open, despite their posted hours saying they should be open. All of the bars \/ clubs were closed entirely for private events. The parking garage had signs saying it would be closed at 7:00am and all cars would be towed.

It all just seemed like a total disaster. And it's a surprisingly very small casino.

The rooms were ok. The TV was the nicest part. Definitely seemed overpriced for what you got. It reminded me of the renovated rooms in the downtown casinos. But, of course, the price tag was not like those downtown rooms.

First of all, the location of this property is abysmal. There is nothing nice around here so, if you're staying here, you're a pretty far walk (by Vegas Strip standards) from anything going on. Also, the location (which is adjacent to some not so nice Las Vegas neighborhoods) lends this place to attract some not so savory characters. 

The restaurants here are outstanding. My personal favorite is Bazaar Meats. I cannot get enough of this place! 

I really like the decor in this place. It is very hip but they also kept some old remnants of the Sahara (the building's previous occupant). The look is eclectic and kind of reminds me of a boutique-y hotel you would find in L.A, or one of the Beach Cities in CA. 

The casino floor is very small. There are few table games (compared to what you would find at other larger casinos). The casino floor is a sea of crammed together slot machines. I'm not much of a gambler, but I did play the Batman slot machine here and it was SUPER fun. I have been to this place 3 or 4 times now and I've never seen anyone gambling in the High Limit room. This is not good news for the new casino on the block. 

All in all the place looks amazing. Restaurants are outstanding. The clientele are sort of iffy, the location is rough and far away from everything. I wouldn't expect this property to be wildly successful.",8,0,4

VACATION FROM HELL
The meaning is supposed to be Style, Luxury, Service and it was far from it.  I think the best way to sum this up is to tell you day by day on my 4 night stay at SLS HELL! I booked this hotel as it was a new hotel and a killer deal, and now I know why.
Day 1:
I came in after my flight from Seattle in the morning and was dropped off at the hotel in the early afternoon.  Upon check in there was a crowd in the lobby and everyone was trying to check in with no organization at all. I went to try and check in a few times but people were jumping in front of one another.  I finally got to a front desk clerk named (Christopher). I spoke to him and he greeted me and asked me which room I would like and I asked him if he could show me the room as there weren't pics on their website. Chirs then said, ""Let me go and find out and it shouldn't be a problem."" He left then came back and we started talking about the rooms. In the middle of our conversation we were interrupted but by a woman named, China. I later found it she was a Frontend manager. She asked Chris if these were the keys that he made for the room for me to view and he responded with yes. She took them and handed them over the counter and to another guy who just walked right up. I looked at her and said, ""Excuse me, but I was here first."" Her response to me was that's the president's brother of the company. I replied with, ""I don't care who he is as I am a paying guest."" I was ignored and he left with my keys and she left the counter. Chris apologized over and over again and agreed that it was up called for that maybe that the behavior was uncalled for?  Chris showed me the rooms and I picked which the one I wanted. We went down stairs downstairs and he gave me my key and I went to my room to freshen up and hit the pool after my flight from Seattle.
I got to my room and started to change out of my jeans and I had my shoes off and just socks on and went to the restroom. I was standing there about to use the restroom and next thing I felt is wetness on my socks. I was so grossed out as I looked down and there is urine all around the toilet seat.  I call guest services and they tell me they will have room service come up and clean it. I was like no way! I want a new room. They responded by saying to me, I will transfer you to the front desk. Just seems like desk services couldn't do anything.  I get the front desk on the line and tell then them what happen happened and was told they didn't have another room and that's when I asked for a manager. The woman on the phone told me to hold and I packed my stuff up and she came back on the phone and then said, ""We are bringing up a key for another room"".  Thirty minutes later they show showed up and I went to the next room and got situated.Day 2:
I left for a bit ad then came back an hour half later. No room service. I call again, wait around 30 mins, no room service, and call again. I go down to the pool and come back after hour and again no room service. I called the Frontend Manager ask to speak with whoever is in charge and they tell me it is someone named Nick. I never hear from him and then finally call again and ask for his boss and then finally get James. He removed the extra service charge that all Vegas hotels give of $25 a day. So the next thing happened later that night after being out all night long the night before. I was exhausted and came in early to sleep for the night but wanted to watch some TV in bed while I passed out. The TV doesn't work. I call for service on it and I am told they are on their way. I have to dress back into my clothes and stay up for them. I wait for 40 mins and then they show up at my door. Security is with the contractor guy as I am told that almost all the rooms they're having this problem and that is why the contractor is at the hotel. If you are having these problems, you'd think you would fix it before people came into their room.Day 3:
I get up like any other day and head toward the strip for lunch with friends as I am down here with 30 plus people for a birthday party.  I come back from lunch and see my room was cleaned and I sit down to change shoes on the bed and I notice there is blood on the pillow. I am grossed out as I am not bleeding nor have blood on me anywhere. I call guest services and they tell me they will have housekeeping come and clean it. 15 mins later the housekeeping supervisor comes and sees the pillow and asks me what I would like them to do and I say clean the room. She removes the pillow herself and tells me she needs to take this to the front desk. They clean my room again. Sheets and all.Day 4:
I go to the restroom after a nap and slip on a metal piece of the sprinkler system from inside the bathroom. The sprinkler system in the bathroom fell apart. I end up spraining my ankle and still have plans for the night to go dancing and another day in V",12,5,0

Few months later got comp stay for being a Vegas local, only pay resort fee, which we did.  However the cafe was taken over by the one that's there now which pales in comparison to its predecessor.  2nd stay made me regret even coming and wasting money on the resort fee.
So 6 months later I get another locals comp stay offer, this time I don't even pay the resort fee.  Sweet, I call up and manage to score a Saturday night stay for $0.00 - we arrived, parked ok, check in ok, went to room in world tower, lovely as usual.
I went downstairs for a little play on the slots, must have been there for almost 2 hours and only saw the cocktail server once in this time.
I went to Umani burger at 7pm for some wings and a drink, we were having a late 10pm dinner and I was starving.  I got sat right away, some big game was on and the place was packed.  They had big leather couches and coffee tables you could reserve and order food and drinks and watch the games in comfort.
So I could not help notice a big homeless man stretched out on the couch sleeping, his bags on the floor and he is snoring very loudly.  He remained there for the whole hour I was there, what's worse is the staff, management and security saw him but did nothing!  This made the visit very uncomfortable for everyone there.
So 10pm comes and we visit the 24 cafe downstairs, only reason we decided to try there again is they added a new authentic Chinese menu.  Really don't like the whole seat yourself change they made, place was very busy full of guests walking around looking for clean tables, more guests than empty tables, very disorganized.  Finally secured table after 10 mins then needed to wait till bus person came to clean it, then we sat and waited 20 or more mins for server who never came, had to go to cashier to ask for service and menus.  Finally server came by to take order and we said we still waiting on the menus, he took drink orders and said he would bring menus, which of course he forgot, eventually remembered and did not bring Chinese menu.  2nd visit to cashier to grab that menu.  We both ordered the pan fried noodles with gai lan and mushrooms, mine with chicken and Johan's with beef.  When it arrived it visually looked revolting, mine with the chicken looked slimy and was swimming in a clear gelatinous goop and both meals had clearly been sitting under the heat lamps cause the noodles around the edge of the plate were burnt.  The meals was just warm, both tasted revolting, my chicken pieces were slimy, mushrooms were slimy and both meals stunk.  We like gai lan (Chinese broccoli) but this was just the chewy stalks.  We ate only a bite or two.
Server came by and asked if we wanted boxes, Johan pulled a face and I said no thanks they were gross, he just walked away and bought the check.  Not wanting to cause a scene, cause we planned to rush upstairs and order a pizza from 800 degrees before they closed.
Made it upstairs and ordered a Hawaiian pizza which arrived in 40 mins, the toppings although sparse were nice, however the base although thin was burnt and chewy.
So upon reflection of this stay, don't care that it was free, nothing else downstairs redeemed them from us ever coming back.",1,0,0

In no particular order, the reasons you should stay away from this place are:
1.  No drawers to put clothes or other items.  A couple of shelves at the minibar, if you don't mind your underwear being out in the open.
2.  The toilet seat was loose and felt like it could break off at any moment.  How is this possible on the first night??
3.  No resort guide in the room showing when everything is open.
4.  Mini-blinds covering the windows.  Seriously?  a $415M upgrade and there are just mini-blinds to keep the light out?
5.  Unstocked mini-bar.  One thing that is advertised is the ""Saints and Sinners Snack Box""  I probably wouldn't get anything from this anyway, but the fact that they didn't stock it makes things seem off.
6.  Closed captioning on the TV doesn't work.  My wife is hard of hearing and the only way she can effectively watch TV is with captioning on.  The 55 inch TV is nice, but without captioning it is useless for her.",3,1,0

No fridge, but there was a mini bar,  little space for personal  belongings, no guest coffee make.  I found it strange that the bed didn't have a bottom fitted sheet.  Had to call house keeping to get a second sheet so I didn't have to sleep on the mattress. The bed was nice and i did have a good sleep. No blackout curtains, so in the morning there is light. Wifi signal was really week, but the front desk did waived the $25.00 resort fee because of that problem.  
The tv went out when I was looking at the in house menu, room service charges a $7.00 service fee on top of the price of the food, two cups of 12oz coffees costed a little over $17.00 dollars. The location of SLS is not in the greatest parts of town, there is a Starbucks and 7-Eleven in walking distance of the hotel. I will warn you there's lots of homeless people so wouldn't walk by yourself if your female.. There casino part of the hotel is cozy, penny slots, craps all the basic games, just no poker room.. 

All in all SLS is nothing to write home about. If you want a Vegas experience I recommend going somewhere else. Flat out disappointed.",1,0,0

You can only do so much with a Sahara bones building, but they did ok.  

Weird experience playing roulette, we got hungry so we went to grab a pizza around the corner at 800 degrees.  When I brought it back they told me I had to eat at the table near the gaming area, which I did.  After eating half we went back to playing and when I turned around ten minutes later the pizza was gone, taken by the staff.  WTF?

When I expressed my concern about the reviews prior to my trip the management  reached out to me to see what they could do to make my birthday weekend better. It sounded like they truly wanted to make this a positive experience. To be fair I will give the good and the bad. 

The Good:

Before I arrived the concierge staff was awesome. They sent me restaurant menus and booked a show for me at a considerable discount. The cleaning staff was courteous and asked if we needed anything extra before she left. She just happened to come along as we left for coffee and she was finishing up when we returned. The room was ok but I loved the big screen tv. There are a lot of mirrors for dressing if you need that. Loved the big shower. I booked my room on Priceline but I called to get an additional room for family traveling with me. They quoted me the same rate I had from Priceline which was awesome. The decor had a cheap makeover feel to me but the bed was comfortable and in general I have no complaints about the room. 

I do suggest that they put a hand towel holder in the bathroom and do something about the sliding door to the bathroom. If you push the door too far when you close it then it's hard to get it open and can get your fingers stuck in there. If you can navigate the website the room looks exactly like the picture. However website is not easy to navigate. The monorail stops at the hotel which is a big plus if you plan it right. Because of the hotel location a cab is a really expensive way to go. If you don't mind a little walking definitely get a monorail pass.

The Bad:

I arrived on a Thursday so I expected the hotel to be a little busy but I waited almost 45 min in line to check in. There was 2 people in front of me and it just seemed like there wasn't enough staff to check in and that there was confusion with the process. My personal check in was pretty quick but I had booked my room on Priceline. I'm all about the little things so it may seem petty but the staff looked at my ID and didn't even say Happy Birthday. For me this check in experience set the tone for my stay. I guess when I'm told they wanted to make my birthday special I expected a warm welcome of some kind. 

A lot of the staff seemed like they did not want to be there. They just didn't seem welcoming and it really turned me off so I did not venture around the hotel too much. All hotel drinks in Vegas are expensive but $9 for a beer and $5 for a small bottle of water just seems a bit much.

When I checked out I was charged a resort fee which seems to defeat the purpose of bidding on a room on Priceline. I've never had to pay anything else at another hotel when using Priceline before. My room should have been completely paid for. The hotel accepted my bid and that should have been it.  Also, when my son checked out they tried to charge him twice as much as the quoted price for one of the nights. If I had not been standing there and intervened about what we were quoted based on my room charge they would have been grossly overcharged. I had to ask for management before it was changed. And again we were not told about the resort fee when I originally reserved this room.

I think if the in person service was as genuine as the service prior to arrival it would make for a better experience.",5,1,1

The elevators are small and offer no AC. To boot only 3\/5 elevators were working Saturday morning. 

This hotel hasn't been open long but the wallpaper was already peeling off in the hallways. 

As far as the room, the bed was comfortable and we really liked the light up mirrors. The down fall is the bathroom has no ventilation and the door does not close shut. It's more of a closet door that sticks out from the door way which leaves a huge crack. 

I would not stay here again or recommend it to a friend.",3,1,1

That's my first complaint: their ventilation system. It's what you would expect from one of the super cheap hotels that are 10 miles away from the strip.  Even in a non smoking room and floor, I can barely breathe, and this is great compared to the casino floor. If you have any breathing problems at all I highly suggest staying far away from this hotel.

My second issue is the room itself. I don't mind small, but this is absurd. I would rather have a bed that's comfortable and supportive over one that lights up. And don't get me started on the bathrooms, the shower straight up looks like it should be at the locker room at your local YMCA. I'm not even going to shower in the morning because I'm so grossed out by it. The entire bathroom set up is simply along the back wall and sliding doors open and close to reveal different sections; there is no real bathroom. I have a beautiful view out of my window looking directly into the parking structure, and closing the blinds was nearly impossible because they have a giant light up couch in front of the window and unless you're 6' tall it's very difficult to reach the curtain rods. 

My third problem is with the restaurants in the hotel. I was here for work and another person in my industry is also staying here so when we were done working we decided to get some food. This was around 10:30pm, so by Vegas standards not late at all, but all the good restaurants were already closed. 

And although this wasn't of a concern to me, if you're wanting to spend most of your time on the strip know that this is VERY far away from all the action. 

Overall, unless price is the absolute only thing you care about in finding a hotel, I would stay away from here. I generally stay at the Vdara or the Aria but decided to save my company $30 and try the SLS this trip, and it was a horrible mistake. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

Being from New York, I did some research online. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pretty satisfied. The hotel was very clean and appeared very chic. The casino was relatively small, but adequate none the less. The staff was friendly, for the most part. One individual was pretty rude when asked where the business center was, but that does not outweigh all others. The business center is actually somewhat contradictory. There are computers that require you to pay for internet use...but there is free wifi throughout the hotel. There is an average variety of things to do\/foods to eat. The pizza place was pretty mediocre, would recommend going there for the gelato, not the pizza. Ku Noodles looked extremely appealing, but unfortunately, we did not have the time. There definitely a thing with faces at this place. From the shades in the bedroom, the paparazzi on the 800 degrees ceiling, and the 3-D face above the bar. A bit unsettling, but interesting. 

The only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is the location. It is very far from the strip, despite being located on S Las Vegas Blvd. Though the monorail was very accommodating, wish it was a bit closer. Also, there is no lobby. There is a concierge lounge, but no other place to sit.",2,0,0

I would say it is a hidden gem on the strip. It's not one of the more popularly known casinos and therefore is not as crowded. If you're looking for good slot machine game choices and a variety of table games without the hassle of the crowds I would definitely give SLS a try, especially for your day and night club experiences!!",0,0,0

*Casino had most up to date slots and fun free spin games

1 star minused for the Bad Location and.... 

*They do not offer in room dining on a regular in room menu, you have to order through one of the 24 hr restaurants directly in the hotel
*Menu was hard to find, they did not have a printed version but instead you have to find it on the tv screen, for someone not young it would be difficult to navigate to find it
*The snacks in the room automatically get biled to your account on the table sensor, within few seconds of the item being touched or misplaced in your room so make sure to not let kids touch it. Plus there was no pricing for them, so expect scary sky high prices for simple nuts and chips you get at 7 eleven
*No infamous Vegas buffet here :(

Location was far (about 10 min drive) from the tip of vegas strip where everything happens, from Caesers palace to gambling to shopping to the fat sundays.... so for a convenience rating this hotel doesn't rank high.

Booked on Orbitz as their ""Deal of the Day,"" I had mixed feelings about this place.  Rooms were very clean and without that disgusting disinfectant smell that many hotels have.  But they were small & no frills.  Minimum everything is all we got.  The restaurants we visited there (Katsuya, Northside Cafe, Umami Burger, The Perq) were just okay, none worth writing home about.

Though I should look on the bright side and figure how much money they saved me (couldn't take it no longer; cashed in my chips, shot over to The Venetian, and lost them in half the time, LOL).

Location at the north end of the strip made going anywhere expensive.  Mostly, we took cabs everywhere, but many dishonest drivers try to take the long way (""but it's quicker,"" sure, and doubles your cost).  The one who took us there from the airport took the expressway, which cost us over $40.  The one who took us back took Paradise the whole way, which was under $20.  He said we should have gotten the first one's number and reported him because that was illegal, but we did not think of that at the time.  Besides the Strip (which is slow), there are enough other back roads (like Paradise) that can get you places quicker than the expressway (and are closer and cheaper).  Several cabbies seemed pissed when I said ""no expressway,"" but I'm the customer.  We also took the monorail to the MGM Grand several times during our week-long stay, and that was a nicer alternative (but only if you're going to select places,  The local bus line (the Deuce) is very slow and, unlike what the schedule says (""15 minutes apart"" during the daytime), we waited between 20 and 39 minutes each and every time (3 in total).",2,0,0

The food choices are varied and Bazaar Meats looks great.  I was able to sample the buffet and Umami burger.  The buffet is solid but on the smaller side of things and with nothing that really stood out as unique.  Umami burger was tasty and I look forward to a return visit to sample more of the menu.  Umami also houses the sports book and has a large patio.  I wish I could have tried all the other places (800 degrees, Griddle Cafe, etc) but it is more reason to go back.  The decor is very modern with video screens, large photos of old school vegas black and whites, and a small but very packed casino floor.  All the latest games are there, both table and slot.  The pool has a swim up bar and a large staging area but overall was on the smaller side.  I was not able to see the rooms.  The SLS seems to be focused on the movers and shakers and is priced accordingly.  

I was very impressed by the staff who are very team oriented and seem to be very proud of their roles with SLS.  

In fact, my only real negative about this place is that the functional casino is small, the restaurant seating is small, the sports book is very small... whether this works as an intimate setting or becomes too small for the crowds it will draw remains to be seen.

The next issue was with the security guards who are incredibly rude! Then we ate at Kasuya on Saturday night and it gave me food poisoning, which ruined my time at the music festival. I have had Katsuya in Los Angeles so I know how good it should be. The one at the SLS is horrible and the sushi is nothing like the original! Do not waste your money. Finally, the cherry on top occurred on my drive home to LA. After driving for about two hours I noticed a sound coming from my tire. I pulled over and saw that the tire on my brand new Mercedes Benz was ripped apart from the rim. I also noticed a huge deep scrape and scuff marks on my rim, tire, and front bumper. Obviously the valet at the hotel had hit a curb really hard or something. If I had continued driving on it the tire would have exploded. I had to wait in the middle of nowhere for a tow truck to come change my tire. It took me about 4 hours on Sunday to get someone from the hotel to call me back about the incident and I have yet to receive an apology for any of this. I will never set foot in that hotel again and I encourage everyone to avoid it as well.

Update - the hotel is now denying any liability for this incident and are claiming the damages were done to my vehicle before I arrived.  They claim to have photo evidence, however will not produce the photos to me or my insurance adjuster.  On another note, I reached out to guest services to complain to a manager who still did not apologize for everything that happened during my stay and he was supposed to get back to me and I have yet to hear from anyone at the hotel with an offer to make things right. Considering my boyfriend and I spent over $5,000 there over the weekend between gambling, food, drinks, and the room, I am repulsed by the way things have been handled.",5,4,2

A lot of freinds and I work in the area and thought we'd go after work. The beer garden has expensive beers, so we thought we'd just gamble. This place has no poker room. No one did research that Sahara used to have some of the best 7pm tournaments around. I'm sure the old regulars would have came back to this place just to avoid the strip. So we left and played poker somewhere else. The next day we thought we'd check this place out for lunch. Mind you, we have only an hour or so, but this place has no type of food court. Not everyone has time to sit down for fine dining. Wanted to check out the buffet, the escalator was broken. Huge giant mirror leaning against a wall near the entrance.

We asked for 4 extra towels and they said they're not sure if they can bring 4, maybe only 2. When I said, are you serious? They then said ""I'll try"" lol.

We had high expectations to celebrate our 5 yr anniversary weekend but unfortunately spent more time complaining about being unable to get to our room for over 3 hours because all three elevators to the lux tower was broken down or how the service was non existent while they had to deal with very low class crowed fighting in the pool club and continued in lobby. After this first night we were left with a very sour taste the rest of the stay where we could observe beyond the initial glitzy smoke and mirrors. 

The rooms were OK but did not have any storage for luggage or clothing. We needed to keep almost everything packing in luggage to take out what we would use for the day. The windows did not have good blinds at all and we woke up to extremely bright room at 5-6am each morning as sun rises. The oversized showers and Mirrors on ceiling and around the room were fun but the highlights of the room ended there.

The pool was extremely small, over crowded  and closed very early each night making it impossible to use unless you wanted to rub up on and fight for space with the other 50 guests trying to wash off their sweat from waiting in line to enter the pool. 


The concierge was excellent and very helpful in helping redeem our weekend with planning a room flower decoration while took wife and friends to a off site restaurant they recommended at the Wynn. 

Overall if you are between ages of 20-25 and expect to get drunk on over priced drinks and try to hit on the very drunk skimpy dressed kids, than SLS is the hotel club for you. If you are an adult looking for a sexy, fun and elegant hotel than look else where as SLS left us feeling like a return visit is out of the question for us.",2,0,0

I landed at the airport around 7:20 and was able to catch the shuttle to the hotel at 7:40! The shuttle driver was so sweet and it was super convenient to catch the shuttle instead of the taxi. Early check in was great and the monorail is the best! $12 for an all day pass and takes u all around the strip. Caught the 6am shuttle the next day for my flight out. We boarded at 5:50 and sure enough we left exactly at 6... The shuttle driver likes to be on time which is awesome. I'll be staying here again in the future and I have to say a big part of why I gave this 5 stars is because the punctual shuttle service!,0,0,0

First, they gave us a smoking room that I requested non smoking room. I found the smell in room and has ashtray. They said if we want to move to a non smoking room then will need to change from 11 floor to 3 floor, we didnt mind since there was no view at all. Then, we found out our conditioner was broken at 11:30 pm when we were back, they are not able to fix it so we had to move to another room again. It was frustrated at all.

Although I would note it's a hotel for a younger crowd, it's located the most north you can be on the strip close to old downtown or what they call the Fremont Experience (I wouldn't recommend going there, it's not where it's busy and a bit sketch). A plus is they're located right next to the monorail which is super easy to use and relatively convenient. However, around the hotel there isn't much. I would much rather stay at the bellagio or around that area which is lower down the strip.

And why does it always seem that of the three people you have at the desk two out of three always seem to be handling the same guest with some issue or another?

As a Vegas local, For variety of food I enjoy SLS. I've worked through each of their restaurants twice and some I'm into my third round. But when it comes to their front desk they are consistently lacking service and even the layout of the front desk is undesirable. The mirrored square columns make it difficult to even see where the front desk staff is or if they are available, they are slow, and rarely make eye contact as if they are afraid someone might need to ask a question.

Now all the above said, once you finally get to the rooms they are clean, unique and have the basic amenities. The dealers are personable and as I said earlier, the food always great. If you are coming just for a meal and to play and want to avoid crowds SLS is a good choice. The front desk situation just set the experience off from the start and left a bad taste and the check out today wasn't any better. 

The apologetic but condescending clerk that checked me in never did manage to have the sparkling water he was going to send to the room arrive. The clerk that checked me out (with two clerks standing behind him just watching- I know weird but frequent thing here) asked how my stay was. I said it was ""ok but average"" he didn't ask anything beyond that or comment further. He just said you are all set and handed back my credit card. I doubt he even listened for my response.

1.) For everyone who gave this hotel less than 3 stars, you're obviously upset that you lost some dough on the slots, get over it. 

2.) Location on the strip: Ever heard of google maps? Probably should have checked that out before booking. Also there's a new program that just started recently...Taxis. 

3.) Quality vs other casinos\/hotels in the area:  Hmm I recall paying around $120\/night and It was damn well worth every penny. Was it 5 star? No. Could anyone have easily gone down the street and paid triple at Mandarin for said level of luxury service, yes.  Champagne taste, beer money...heard of that? 

On with the Good

1.) The Restaurants are FANTASTIC. I stayed for a week and had made reservations elsewhere prior to my arrival. Ended up canceling half of them. I would have eaten at CLEO every night of the week if my bf didn't insist we try something else. Hands down the BEST cocktails I've ever had. The service was on point, food was delectable, the waiter was like an old college buddy, just really personable and made the evening that much more enjoyable. 
800 Degrees makes delicious custom order pizza and you can get two scoops of gelato for $3, score!
The Griddle Cafe, has amazing French Press coffee and the best (yes that's getting redundant but its true) Juevos Rancheros,called Tequila Sunrise on their menu, I've ever had. EVER 
While I didn't try Bazaar Meat, I did frequent Jose Andres other restaurant Jaleo and the food was delish. I'll be sure to try it next time I'm there.
Umami..just try it. Burgers, beer, betting,yes please. Chill ass outside bar seating overlooking the strip. 
 Also excited for Beach Life to open!

2.) I just have to say as an ex-smoker, I can't stand the smell of it. Not a hint of ashy death at this place. The Hotel smells divine..seriously I wish I could bottle it and spray my home with the scent. Im assuming it's a mixture of some powerful air filtration system and hidden fragrance machines, also the pastry aroma lingering around The Perq.  To Die For.

3.) The staff was always friendly and accommodating. Nice having security near the elevators checking for key cards as well. 

4.) Chair hogs are my biggest hotel pool pet peeve. There wasn't an abandoned towel in sight. Nice bar in the center and plenty of lounges\/cabanas. 

5.) Last but not least..the decor : Ugh stunning, I mean really beautiful designs from the casino to the restaurants and bars, shops and rooms. I loved everything about it. 
The bathroom has an amazing shower, ample closet space with adorable pink hangers, full size ironing board, 6 drawers, separate water closet, the bed was so f-ing comfortable, i have back issues and this was like sleeping on a cloud. yes a cloud. 

   For the money SLS is amazing, if you don't mind being further down the strip, or have heard of taxis\/rental cars, you're in for a real treat. Don't listen to the pretentious idiots inflated by their own yelp egos. I have a feeling this'll become the new place to be.",7,7,6

Their customer service is indeed subpar in some spots. We had a question about our account before checking out so we called the operator and were put on hold for 30 minutes! Only to find out downstairs that they weren't even busy. What was that about?

I'm giving them 4 stars as opposed to 3 cuz I felt the positives outweighed the negatives for the most part. Checking in was a bit slow, although once I finally got to the desk, the lady was very helpful and booked us a room on the second highest floor of the World Tower. Got to our room and loved it!

First time staying in a boutique hotel and wasn't disappointed. Room was very clean and accomodating with some of the most coolest lighted mirrors I've ever seen. With a press of a button they are illuminated with a bright light that fits the mirror like a frame. Very nice. 

Oh, and they also have a Beatles carpet in the lobby which gives them bonus points in my book.

SLS will get you checked into your room in no time, and when you attempt to get to your room the bouncer at the front of the elevators will make sure you have your room key so you will waste no time trying to find it when you get up to floor. When you finally get to your room don't worry about being too loud.  Everyone around you is drunk too and I did not see a single child during my stay here.

However, if you are a light sleeper or don't plan on getting fall down drunk I would highly recommend avoiding this hotel.  The front desk is unfriendly and unwelcoming but none the less quick.  They give you your keys and neglect to share any other information.  Each and every time you want to go back to your room you must fish your room key out and show it to the bouncer.  Who besides does not smile has no clue where anything is in the hotel if you ask him.  For example I asked 4 different employees where the fitness room is ( and no it is not on the directory map near check in).

The walls too as others have mentioned are paper thin.  I have never stayed in a hotel where you can clearly hear and understand what the others rooms are saying.  Also don't go near the mini bar.  The food is kept in a pressure sensitive tray.  If you remove an item to look at it to find the price you will be charged for it.

The TV is where you find the room service menu and other key info on your stay.  No one will mention that to you.

The fitness center is clean and well kept.  Downside you must find it and they are only open for a short portion of the day.

The room was paid for online by my in-laws for our wedding night. Checked in and left my card information for incidentals, which was typical. The girl at the counter with the loose fitting top and no bra and terrible customer service skills was not typical. Even being a vegas local, I still felt awkward in this situation. I mean seriously, how do you tell a woman that she's inappropriately exposed without coming off sexist or misogynistic? 

Regardless, after returning home I had discovered my card had been charged the full amount for the room. I thought perhaps there was confusion about the condition of the room, so I called and inquired as to the charge. The rude CS rep basically told me that my in-laws just reserved the room, and my card was the one that was actually the card that paid. So, naturally, next phone call was to my in-laws. Who indeed confirmed their card was charged the full amount as well.

Now I suppose it's important to note that we booked through a third party site. However, the third party site merely forwarded the cost of the hotel to the hotel. After a number of phone calls they did reimburse us the service charge for the booking. More than I can say for SLS.

After weeks and numerous phone calls from my self and my in-laws to the SLS, and after many rude responses from SLS' highly trained support staff (sarcasm), and getting no where, we finally ate the cost.

But I guess when you're going under, you'll do anything to stay afloat. Glad to see you guys on the way out. I'll be staying at the M from now on.

I admit I was excited and nervous to stay here after reading all of the reviews.  Many people have mentioned the ""LA feel"" it was trying to bring to Las Vegas and being raised in LA, this piqued my interest.

So, upon check-in I quickly realized there was no ""LA feel"" to this place at all.  The hotel is what it advertises, a boutique hotel bringing a certain element of charm and trendy-ness to the already chaotic Las Vegas Strip.  There was nothing about this hotel that didn't ooze customer service and since they are branding themselves as being superior in luxury and class I'd say this was a top notch effort on their part.  Everyone from the amazing valet people to the workers at the coffee place were great and friendly and actually remembered who you were.  I know it's odd to mention the valet in a review about the hotel but trust me, if you've been there you know why and if you haven't then stop on by and find out.

The room itself was in line with what I expected.  I had a Lux king suite and there were 3 things that caught my attention right away:

1.  No door to the bathroom\/shower area and the see through glass with curtain on the outside of the shower.  I'm not gonna point out the obvious here but it made me laugh all things considering.

2.  White..  Everything was white lol.  The bed, the walls, the tile.  For some reason I was expecting pink but I was happily surprised to see it was all white.

3.  The shower.  By far the best hotel shower I've ever been in hands down.  You may or may not like everything else about this place but you will not convince me the shower was not the best thing about the room.

As for the rest of the hotel I found it appropriate with the rest of the strip hotels.  There was the casino floor, some boutique Fred Segal shops and a handful of restaurants that surrounded the exterior of the main gaming area.  Unfortunately I didn't get to eat there as I had plans at other places but it all looked amazing.   

The only knock on the rating had to do with the amenities.  I'd had an order placed for a few things to be delivered to the room and unfortunately it appeared there was a mix up with the concierge staff and things came at random times and one thing accidentally got delivered twice.  Now, with that I will say this:  The concierge team, especially Angie, is AMAZING.  When I called to find out what was going on with all the confusion they were on it immediately and didn't give me any hassle about the item that was delivered twice.  The took care of the mistake and were completely helpful in the resolution.

I made my reservation before reading reviews on Yelp and their Facebook page. It seems as though they've had some trouble, but doesn't every business when they first open and try to iron out the details? I know that they have these hotels in other cities, but Vegas is its own beast. 

I loved the decor of the hotel, and found our room to be very 'posh'. The room was clean upon entry. The mirrors on either side of the room definitely added to the 'wow' factor. I want some of those in my own house! However, we didn't have the most amazing view from our window. It was a glamorous view of the parking lot. That didn't phase me much, since we kept the blinds shut the entire time. 

The casino is small, but adequate for the amount of people that frequent the hotel. I was more impressed at the variety of restaurants they had. Although we wanted to try the pizza place, they were closed for a private event. We ended up eating at Umami...it was SO delicious!

I'd definitely stay at SLS again...but feel that for my next Vegas trip, I'd like to stay somewhere that has a more central location on the strip.",3,0,0

I quite like the idea of avoiding the mayhem of the major night clubs and just splitting a few bottles of champagne with my girlfriends. The sampling of food offered at José Andrés new Bazaar Meat was amazing.  It has a super trendy decor yet feels intimate and welcoming at the same time.

It was very comfortable, and the towels were great, no complaints there.  Be aware that there are no drawers or places to put your clothes in this room. The hotel is brand new, so everything is clean, although the building has some strange vanilla scent that hits you when you walk in, which I personally did not care for.
The casino itself is the big let-down.  It is so small.  And it's not that well decorated.  The ceiling is black pipes which don't look trendy or cool--*maybe* if they were chrome? Not sure.  But the decor, along with the monkeys and all the acronyms spelling SLS, could be eliminated as far as I'm concerned.
It is vital to note that the WIFI CONNECTION IS AWFUL.  The hotel has free, open WiFi, but it is undependable, slow, kicks you off the Internet regularly, and feels worse than modem days when you were online and someone called the house.
The cafe downstairs, Northside, is overpriced and not good.
I called concierge once from my cell phone and informed them that the phone in my room wasn't working, but they did not seem fazed at all, and in fact no one addressed that issue during my stay there.  I requested an extra washcloth, and they forgot about my call; when I called back an hour later, the woman at the desk said she had no request listed for my room...weird.  Then someone came to my room with three bath towels and three hand towels, but no washcloths.
The hotel is cheaper than others, and it is new and clean, so I would not dissuade anyone from staying here.

Good atmosphere? Very modern & cool
Worth the price? 100%
Will we go back? Absolutely

We loved the renovations to the old Sahara. The inside was clean, modern, and so stylish. They had Fred Segal shops throughout the lobby, so you know the place is made for people seeking quality and style.

The room was tiny, yet very cool the way it was set up. There was a sliding mirror wall that would slide to close the bathroom door, cover the sink, or close the shower. A great use of space by the architects & interior designers challenged by no square footage.

The pool was pretty, and the staff was nice. But if you're looking for a pool to get some sun at, this is not the right place. Since the pool is in the middle of the courtyard, sunbathers have to move 4 times a day to stay in the sun. But the bar in the middle and the layout is perfect for partying.

The location isn't great, you cannot really walk anywhere, but it is right next to the monorail which can take you basically anywhere. I suggest this over the cab line which can be spotty and long since it is in it's own remote location.

Main problem is geography.  This hotel sits on the extreme northern end of the strip across from the Stratosphere.  Other than the LV Convention Center and some construction sites - there is nothing close by.  The nearest neighboring attraction is a cab-ride away down crowded Las Vegas Blvd.

Even worse, the rooms themselves are small by Vegas standards.  Similarly priced hotels (at least for the week I travelled) like Cosmo, the Venetian, Mandalay Bay and others - offer rooms that are more or less suites.  In the Lux Tower of SLS (apparently the better of the towers) the rooms are exceedingly small in comparison with a lot of decorative (i.e. useless) furniture.  So while it kinda looked cool, the room proved poorly functional.

The restaurant options are over-rotated to the high end.  A steak joint that will run you will into the multi-hundreds (even for two), a high-end sushi joint (at least in price) and an over-priced Café.  800-Degree pizza is reasonably priced but it is a chain restaurant.

I guess the main problem for me is that I've been to Vegas enough  to know better.  If you consider the SLS as a stand-alone hotel - I suppose they do a reasonable job.  I have no particular gripe about their service or their staff.  I got everything I paid for at the end of the day.  But I'm also well aware of what the hotels down the street offer in terms of luxuries,  experiences, and perhaps most importantly on the strip, geography.

Before you book, please note that this is part of SBE from Los Angeles. They are known for their nightclubs, lounges, nightlife, and restaurants. They are opening up international with the SLS hotels and also with their Katsuya Susi brand restaurant.
The CEO and co founder is a genius and he knows exactly where to open up his establishments and bring the area to life.  As a native LA resident in the past 10 years have been to all the establishments, stayed at SLS Beverly Hills, and SLS Miami. 

The SLS Las Vegas is gorgeous. This was the old Sahara Hotel. They still left the feel of Old Hollywood in the Hotel. I stayed in the World Tower, and it was a bit small, please note that these were the OLD Sahara rooms, that were modernized and re designed. The Foxtail Pool is beautiful, peaceful and Roomy! Very open space.  I went to the Umami Burger Beer Garden and Sports Bar. THE BEST SPORTS BAR IN VEGAS.  So many TV Screens and was able to watch 3 Football games at once.  This was the best part of my stay.
Another good part of the Hotel is the clubs. As a Hotel Guest you have VIP admission no cover to go into LIFE, Sayers Club and Foxtail.  During my stay did one night at LIFE.  Please note that Steve Agnello from Swedish House Mafia has residency here at the SLS. He will no longer be at the Wynn\/Encore.  Another night went to Sayers Club which is a lounge and they play LIVE music.  There is NO place in Vegas that place Live music.  This is actually part owned by Lenny Kravitz.

Another good part of the Hotel is the Restaurants.  Went to the Buffet and it was amazing.  SLS has the BEST CHEFS ever in their establishments.  It is quality. People say it is pricey, but you are paying for Quality.  Went to the Griddle that is not owned by the Hotel, it is a Los Angeles based breakfast establishment that ALWAYS ALWAYS has a line. BEST pancakes ever!!!!! Open from 11pm to the next day at 4pm.  YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE.
Another place is the world Famous KATSUYA Sushi bar.  CLEO's that has the BEST mediterean tapas style food.  They have one in LA and it the best to die for food.
Of course then you have the world famous Chef Jose Andres with his Baazar and the food is amazing!!!

Overall I was impressed with how much work and design was put into the SLS Hotel. I was amazed and it felt like a boutique Hotel.

Also the Drinks at the Clubs, the bars, the Monkey Bar is amazing!!!! They are pricey average anywhere from 12.00- 20.00 a cocktail.  YOU ARE PAYING FOR QUALITY.

The company SBE puts alot of effort, research and heart into their venues.  I DO NOT WORK for them. I live in Los Angeles and they are the nightlife of Los Angeles and have a great reputation of excellent service.

To start, the hotel offers free shuttle service to and from McCarran airport. No need to waste money on a taxi! Upon arriving at the hotel, we noticed how clean and modern it looked. It definitely reminded us of the Cosmopolitan. We especially loved the throwbacks to the old Sahara hotel. Very classy!

Check-in was quick and before we knew it, we were on our way up to our room. The room itself was very clean with modern decor. All the bedding was clean and extremely comfortable. The mirror on the ceiling was also a very nice touch! The room also came with a large LCD\/LED TV, bluetooth radio clock and usb power hookups for phone charging (a must at any decent hotel). The room's hvac controls worked well and the walls seemed very well insulated from noise. We did not hear anyone else the entire trip while we were in the room or in the hall.

The bathroom was nice and bright with new fixtures. It was stocked with all your basic amenities and also some of the most comfortable bathrobes we have used! The girlfriend was extremely tempted to buy one before we left! The shower was very spacious with a standard shower head and a rain shower head with excellent drainage (No one likes to stand in a pool of bath water). The best part was that the water pressure was strong enough to use both shower heads at the same time! No more standing in the cold while the girlfriend hogs all the hot water! There's also a large window (with curtains of course) between the shower and the room for a little voyeurism!

When we were finally able to tear ourselves away from the room to rejoin the rest of civilization, we were pleasantly surprised by how uncrowded the hotel was even though they were sold out of rooms. If you've been to some of the larger hotels like the Bellagio you'll know that you have to throw elbows just to walk the casino floor! We were very happy to be staying at much quieter and classier hotel.

For dining, we were only able to try Cleo during this trip, but it was AMAZING! I'll preface this quick restaurant review by saying that my gf is a self-proclaimed foodie and has tried some of the best Los Angeles has to offer, yet she would not stop talking about how delicious the food and cocktails were at Cleo. I'll save the full review for Cleo's review page, but we ordered the chili-lime oysters, watermelon salad, brussel sprouts, lamb tagine, grilled octopus, and wagyu kebabs. Everything was fresh and excellently prepared. Service was impeccable and we were checked on by restaurant management multiple times throughout our meal. We could not have asked for anything better!

Because our trip was so short, we were not able to try any of the pools, bars, or other restaurants unfortunately. But we very much look forward to checking them out on our next visit back which we will be booking very shortly! The bottom line is, if you looking for a classy and romantic hotel and are tired of the crowded and obnoxiously loud strip center hotels, try the SLS. You won't be dissapointed!

Used to be the Sahara. Now it's more of a cool hip boutique style joint. First time staying here and it was a lot of fun. Loving the rock star look and feel.

Monkey Bar in the main lobby to get a cocktail after a long day at the convention center was solid. Perq coffee shop next door fueled me up with tasty iced coffee each morning while getting ready for the day. The gym area was just ok and offered me a reason to get in a few workouts, but it could have been better. Some restaurants  - Mediterranean, Sushi, Diner, Burger place - Steakhouse -  Pizza place - all on the premises. Bar in middle of casino floor too with funky seating. The Foundry live entertainment hall features many big time musical acts. A few retail shops on hand to pick up drinks, toiletries, snacks, souvenirs, and such.

Nice layout to the gaming floor. More of a smaller sized casino but with plenty of slots and assorted table games. Yeah, the kid gambled a bit and did well.

Very cool retro chic Rat Pack vibe going on here overall but with a modern twist. The rooms in each tower and halls seem to have a fun decor\/theme to them. My room was clean, good AC, hot shower, flat screen TV, etc. No complaints. Slept well.

Really nice pool area with a stage for nightly performances and a DJ. Being that it was 105 the days I was here I pretty much avoided going outside in the heat and blazing sunlight. Like a vampire I only galavanted at night.

The monorail is also connected here for easy travels up and down the Strip, and to the convention center.

The monorail is right there and so is Unami, with their super comfy couches for watching whatever sports you request, but the restaurants had weird hours. I wanted to check out the buffet, but it was closed for the season. As a northern state resident, I was appalled that the pool wasn't open in January (apparently it was unseasonable warm, but coming from -4, I'm that girl in shorts when its over 50), I got to splash around while I was taking a ""tour"" but they wouldn't let me sit in the chairs until my 2nd day. I would stay again as the monorail has super cheap passes, but they need to fix the freakin WiFi and the hotel keys de-magnetize at a slight breeze. All in all, worth the value.",0,0,0

DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT STAY HERE, unless of course you'd like to deal with the WORST staff in the world, end up racking up a ridiculous bill you never anticipated then getting pushed around and never getting your money back.

Rooms are small, it's completely off the strip, and wait for it- the worst problem of all... I booked my room online, paid for the first night of two on my credit card. Get to the hotel and the DUMB girl who was supposed to charge my boyfriend for the second night, charges the ENTIRE AMOUNT again on his debit card. A manager, Leo Demarsh ""tries"" to reverse charges, this never happens, so now we have almost $1000 racked on debit bills which a credit card company can't even reverse for about 3-5 business days when our room was supposed to be $500 for the two nights. 

When we were leaving the girl who originally messed everything up tried to tell us that ""she didn't do that"".... ?? It's like um, yes actually you did, because the credit card gods did not.

Leo was completely unreachable I had to call the SLS and SBE head to reverse the charges, get in contact with their accounting department, overall didn't see the funds for almost two weeks prior. My boyfriend figured $1000 cash for the weekend was a good enough amount to transfer to his debit account for the weekend, but when SLS messes up and charges you $700 to stay, pretty sure $300 is not going to get us very far.


Ended up paying more fees with my bank for going over my daily limit of $1000 a day. Entire trip ended up costing us three times as much as anticipated and many hours tryingt o track down all these reverse charges.

I'll just say this hotel is incredibly uncomfortable. It's the Sahara redone -not imploded and built from scratch. It looks fabulous and has really forward visuals. But apparently they couldn't get that old casino stench out so they pump in strongly perfumed air from which there is no respite. If you're sensitive to smells, don't come here. If you like certain amenities, like a top sheet on the bed, stay elsewhere. The rooms in the Story Tower are small and made tinier by the placement of the bed in the center of the room so there is an aisle all around it.  (There's also no ice machines in this tower) But they're really interesting. The headboard assembly is formed white plastic and has controls to illuminate it from within. Same with the sofa. It's formed white plastic with white cushions and it's lit from within. It makes for a really cool effect. Another unique feature are the two mirrored sliding doors which hide two of four spaces at a time: the entry, the shower, the sink, the toilet. This can be awkward, as coming out of the toilet area I slid the door aside, unaware my husband was brushing his teeth at the sink next to it he had to jump back to avoid being hit. The tiles in these bath areas were a jarring primary yellow.  It's sort of ""oh I see what you're doing here: all white with a splash of a single primary color"" but it's heavy handed. Anyway, I felt that effort was worth mentioning. And the staff was incredibly nice.  Really sweet everywhere. They're trying.

Everywhere you go, staff is asking to see your room key or making sure your a guest, which at first I thought was great but after the 5th time it becomes extremely aggravating and makes me feel unwelcome as a guest. If I'm paying to stay at a hotel, I don't want to constantly have to prove that I'm a guest. Note to staff: Be friendly.
On top of that, the hotel itself is cheap. It doesn't know what it wants to be, the decorations are comical and gaudy and there is no common theme. Why do the staff wear checkered coats?

We came through the back way since most of the cabs enter through las vegas blvd INSTEAD of the real entrance on paradise rd (i think thats what the street is called). So we had to walk ALL the way to the other side of the hotel and we looked a little lost and thats why I'm giving 3 stars because there were NO SIGNS, no one in the front to ask us if we were checking in and the hotel was obviously unfinished.

pros- 
Very Hollywood posh and has a modern vibe.

A lot of mirror space in the rooms (FOR US GIRL MIRROR HOGS)

cons-
the hallways look like a scene from the movie ""the ring"" 
the bathroom sliding door doesn't close completely and leave a crack open for everyone to hear you do your business!

I have stayed in the rooms and I will say they are pretty nice, bright and modern yet still fairly small. The W took over one of the towers so maybe that will draw people in. The pool is small and looks pretty regular. 

The color run after party 2017 was suppose to be held at SLS. It was advertised on the color run website and even promoted at the run. But when people arrived NOBODY at SLS had any idea what anyone was talking about. After someone even spoke to a hotel manager, they looked it up online, saw the flyer advertising an after party at foxtail pool and the manager and bartendars at the pool had NO CLUE about it.

First, this is a boutique hotel (it's totally advertised as such) - so no huge suites here, but the rooms are awesome. so much mirror space!! I didn't have to be in the bathroom crowding my fiancé while he tries to shave and I try to put on makeup - nope, I could set up in the room with plenty of light and mirrors and outlets!! I'm convinced a girl designed the rooms! 

The SLS is also on the end of the strip, so you can't walk out the door and just cross the street to another big hotel - BUT, the monorail stops at the SLS front door!! So everything is just a quick train ride away - which cuts down on taxi fare. 

The Buffet - amazing. Really, one of the best I've been to. And Umami is delicious!!

So overall, good hotel.  We found an awesome photography gallery on the second floor.  I was never able to find out who the monkey photographer was, which made me sad.  Customer service is excellent. I would stay here again as long as the price is right.

[edit #2]
The customer service is beyond excellent - we had to call in on two occasions and someone was delivering within five minutes.  Raised the stars to 4; it would be 5 is the cleaning service had finished cleaning the bathroom and if the room actually had drawers.  I did find a naughty kit in the mini bar with two condoms, lube, and a vibrator for $20! That alone warranted a fourth star. lol

[edit #1]
The bed is awesome!!!  Just had the best nap ever!
[\/edit]

The hotel looks very sleek and modern and so far, the staff has been polite, friendly, and efficient.

I am not a big fan of the room though.  For a suite, it is cramped and the lack of a bathtub makes me sad.  The complete non-existence of drawers and wardrobe just baffles me - we just have a counter top with a shelf so all the unmentionables (and considering this is Vegas, I have a variety of unmentionables) are sitting out in the open and a rack with hangers. Rather disconcerting.  

There are not many plugs and only one side of the bed has outlets; considering this is a brand new hotel, you would think they would have taken into consideration people have phones, iPads, laptops, etc.  we do have mirrors everywhere. Large mirrors. Mirrors instead of walls. And one cracked one, which is a bit ghetto.

Anyhow... The hotel is part of the monorail system - the 3 day cost is $28.  Considering the location of the hotel, this is a must since we flew in.

Finally, the hotel does not have a buffet, which is odd.

Even then, I recognized it was a bit dated from the rest of the Strip but still enjoyed its classy Vegas vibe.

Unfortunately, my standards were either too high or SLS's were too low.  It's the Sahara, but gutted and with industrial but also upscale decor that doesn't quite fit.  We actually came here for Valentine's Day since we heard it was a pretty cool place and figured it would make for a nice evening.  At the very least, it was an evening of new experiences.

Some areas of the casino felt too crowded and clumped together, while others had so much empty space it felt awkward.  None of the restaurants really seemed to stand out and after walking past the tables it did not seem lively at all.  Mind you, this was a Saturday night.

We circled around the property and examined everything it had to offer, and then we left.  The one bonus is that it was so slow we got a parking spot almost next to the elevator.  Did I mention this was a Saturday night?

Knowing in advance that our flight was not due in until 11 PM or so, I called the hotel several days prior as to note our file with a late arrival. We arrived to the hotel close to midnight, checked in, and went up to our room. When we got into our room, realized that is was not the style of room we booked.

After re-explaining our situation, they finally gave us keys to the new room, apologized to us and promised that we would be contacted the next day from ""Guest Services"" in order to switch to a king room.

Anyway, I called and told them it was just as bad as the first room so they sent up head of housekeeping to address the situation. She said she would have someone come up to clean the room which was nice, but also an inconvenience because we now had to leave the room.

The mirrors all over the room disturbed the tranquility of my sleep. Believe it or not, but mirrors are stimulating! Yes, they expand a room's size, they increase light, but they also draw in and deflect energies. I can never get a good night sleep here. Sure the hotel looks clean, and the staff is helpful. However, it is considered bad omen to have mirrors in front of your bed. According to Feng Shui experts,  the mirror doubles and bounces all sorts of energy, it disrupts the tranquility needed in a bedroom for better sleep. You'll have insomnia, possible nightmares and even loss of love. Plus the beds are under a window which is considered bad luck, and cause financial loss.That's probably what this hotel wants to do.

The hotel is a bit further north than I prefer to stay but we had plenty to do at the hotel (restaurants, pool, Sayers Club, Life). It's also a quick cab ride, shuttle ride or bus ride to the center strip area. We really did enjoy the decor of the whole hotel- even the large photographs in each of the elevators. We actually loved our room but the poor customer service was such a turn off for us.

The room:
We stayed in the world tower in just their basic one king bed room and it felt nice and spacious.  It really needed a little cocktail table for when we were pre gaming and chit chatting.   Bathroom was also very nice and spacious.  Although it did need brighter lighting.   Room felt fresh and clean !  

Casino:  
Was a little too small for my taste but the cocktail girls were very good about bringing out delicious cocktails so that kept me happy at my machines.   Server started anticipating our drinks and kept them coming back to back.  Loved it !!  

Location:
Don't walk to the canal shops or fashion show mall.   Just don't.   It is really really far.   I'm fairly fit but still felt the huff n puff of that long long walk.   Take the monorail!  It's connected to the hotel and it literally takes 5 seconds to hop on.  No twists and turns or hidden passages to get out like at other casinos.  There's free valet and free parking so that vegas charm is still apart of the property

Customer service:
All throughout it was exceptional!  We did have a minor hiccup.  We called front desk about getting a late check out and it was given to us at no charge.  I called the next day just to confirm and there was no record of my late check out and it was no longer available.   Front desk; however, was extremely quick to take care of it and granted a late check out. No hassles just friendly service.  My call was probably 2 minutes long.  Hung up with a smile and in need of pressing my ""that was easy button"" lol.

Pool:
Since its been raining the pool was open weather permitting.   I didn't think it would be open so I didn't prepare for it but it looked large enough to relax in with some cocktails.

Would I stay here again?  ABSOLUTELY !   And don't worry about any hookers or bums.  The security here is top notch and take security serious.  Won't let unwanted non-guests come up the elevators.   Yes you do also need a key card to call the elevator but that's just another added layer of safety in sin city which I'm more than willing to accept.",0,0,0

As soon as we got to the check-in desk, there was a long line just to check in. And even hours later when we came back down to the lobby, there was still a line. In my opinion, you should NEVER be stuck in a LINE at the check in desk at a hotel. Don't even get me started on the refrigerator inside the room. I understand that there are drinks for purchase in there but to have NO space for your own drinks?? Come on...I also was annoyed with the shower because the only way to turn the water on was to get yourself wet first--poor architecture or whatever you want to call it. I also found 2 separate hairs when I undid the comforter to get into bed. I forgot to take a picture of this but there was a RED SMEAR on the bed frame (which was white)--I'm hoping that was just lipstick but seriously, EW! We got free entrance to the Foxtail club because a promoter approached us in the lobby. He gave us free drink tickets but guess what....I couldn't even get a corona with this ticket!

No, I'm speaking from a owner's point of view for the SBE group.  As some place puts it, this place is a mish mosh of sorts. They kept some place looking new and some reused , and of course some that should've been just thrown away but they kept it anyways. 

One thing I noticed before I even walked in, the garage was filthy. I was here for the week of CES during early January. I can tell you, no one really invests $$ inside a garage. However, proper housekeeping outside usually will at least polish your image of the inside as well. So from the garage, to the elevator, to the walkway, someone please get a blower to clean this place up. It was like that the whole week I was here. 

As for the inside, it was nicer. You can see the disco type lights as you walk in. Music for the younger, trendy folks. Even some of the lettering was quite nice. But again, some of the parts of the casino you can tell seems like it was resalvaged. 

Speaking of inside the casino, you won't be able to use the $40 buffet because it's not in operation. Not that you probably want to spend $40 anyways because one of the dealer told me they would rather go somewhere else for the same price. Again, charging people cavier dreams on a beer budget. 

What really was a little unnerving for me was one of the dealers I had had the audicity to told me if I knew how to play pai gow. Not only that, he flat out was angry at me at every hand I put out. That, was such a turn off. If I want to play, I should be able to play however I want. (well, according to the rules of the game right? ) I also play blackjack but I will never complaint to the person who will split a pair of 10s because it's his or her money. You know what I mean? 

I even won a few hands to get a ticket for a money drawing. They told me 7 O' clock on Friday was the drawing. Needs to be present to be in the drawing.  I believe they chose this time because it was an impossible time for the weekday folks like me, and if you come on the weekend you would need to play early enough to win a ticket for the drawing. Ugh. 

We played craps for a bit. (~ 2 hours). We tried asking for casino rate to the rooms here on a week night. The pit supervisor asked for availability and quote us $169 for the night. What? No thank you. 

Sam Nazarian, please work out some of these kinks. If you want to charge caviar dreams, please train your workers ,clean up the place a bit, and make sure you have everything open here.",14,3,4

To start the hotel is VERY Miami.
There are two arrival areas and are very confusing, which in turn made us have a long walk to the check in area. Check-in was painfully slow. Also, cabs are a long wait to be had no matter which entrance you try as the hotel is so far off from the strip.

The ROOM was nice, yes it's a bit smaller than others but since i went in with low expectations i guess i was nicely surprised. The shower was great and we really liked the mirrors. One day after being gone from 9am-3pm our room had still not been attended to by the housekeepers. ugh.

The POOL was also nice. Nothing fabulous to report. Especially the service. You can see in my picture that the waitresses often stood at the bar waiting on drinks instead of waiting on customers. It was impossible to get their attention, and when you did - they told you to wait. very disappointing. I will say the food was good. But if you are looking for better and friendlier service, just sit at the bar as the bartenders were great.

The RESTAURANTS were incredibly slow. You'll see a line at any vegas restaurant or coffee shop, but these were painful. UMAMI service was awful. We waited for almost 15 minutes for any server to come to us for even water, the burgers were ok. To get our check was additional 25 minutes! Don't you want us to be gambling?? I never tried the GRIDDLE as the line was ridiculous and they wouldn't let you take ""to go."" My boyfriend went to PERQ for a tea and 35 minutes later finally returned. 

The CASINO was probably the only good item on the list. Though the slot machines haven't been played enough that there was no noise of winnings coming from them. 

The CLUB was decent. I won tickets to see a DJ at LIFE on friday nite, we stayed a total of 20minutes. Nothing better than what i can already receive in NY. and it wasn't even a huge named DJ to get the crowd amp'd. The crowd was very B&T by NY standards.

All in all, if i had another ""special"" on the rooms i'd come again. But other than that, we would not return. Not even to gamble.",4,6,3

Of course the location is pretty messed up no matter what you put in this location. It's at the end of the strip and new and improved casinos are being built faster than a blink of an eye. Not many tourists get to walk down this far. 

I've stayed at this hotel a couple times. Once for a Yelp Event which was amazing. Shout out to Nate one more time! Another time was for Nieves D.'s bachelorette party. We got the biggest room they offer! And to be honest their biggest room is really NOT that big BUT needless to say it is a very nice room. It has a living room and a bed room. There wasn't a door separating the two rooms but where was a wall. This particular suite didn't have a fridge which threw me off because usually suites do. Also the smaller room we had at the Yelp event had a big a** mirror where you can light up where as this suite didn't have one. The walls are kind of odd as well because it is some sort of drape on the wall that has a vintage print on it. It's not wall paper but just cloth hanging on all the walls. The decor is very clique though. 

The beds are comfy. The bathroom was nice. The lotion smells so good! Probably the best one I've smelt in any hotel.

We arrived at the hotel 4:30pm (for 3pm check-in) and the front desk told us that the room is not available yet. When I asked if she could give us an estimate when it will be ready she said ""I don't know"", that is absolutely RIDICULOUS. After 5 hours of driving there's nothing worse than standing there and waiting for your room, that was supposed to be ready at 3! After seeing our frustration she gave us a $25 voucher to use at the hotel for food, but even that was ridiculous considering a breakfast burrito at this hotel is about $15. 

After reading some reviews prior to choosing this hotel, it seemed that many people complained about the overpriced and ""sensitive"" minibar where if you remove anything over 60 seconds you're charged for it. Knowing this we didn't even TOUCH the mini bar during our stay but apparently that didn't matter because upon checking out we were charged $10 for a tiny box of popcorn that once again, was not even touched! 

The sink is extremely small\/shallow in the bathroom, there's no bathtub which was a  major bummer, and the bathroom door is a swinging door, so there's not much privacy.

I'm positive someone has run into a mirror or two or three (but it's only one really.. or is it??!) , after the night ends. My room was on the 10th floor and thankfully, it was quiet .. despite it all. Very W-esque in its decor and feel. If you have been to a W Hotel or even some of the Le Meridian's , you know what I mean. If you haven't , they are ultra chic and ultra modern , with a cool feel to them. Trendy decor and not your grandmothers provincial wallpaper donning the walls. The SLS greets you with black and white when you enter your room. More mirrors that are back lit.. a nice bathroom and trendy , young art on the walls and wait.. people are clapping at me on the blinds too?!! Nope, I doubt my parents would like this place. There is a Saints & Sinners amenity for purchase above the stocked mini bar. Yes .. there are us Sinners and there are us Saints! I won't say which section I took from. Room service can be ordered via your interactive tele! Awesome.. this is a day I needed a wine or two and someone to serve me! It comes at a price though! My club sandwich and small chopped salad did not cost as much as the $22 service charges! Yikes! BUT, HUGE portions and fast service met me and it was worth it, imo. There are two restaurants for room service one is Italian and one is Asian and more of a 24 hour cafe .. but cool and trendy.. and two ( maybe three ? coffee shops ) ... Perq closes at 900pm. Sharp! Both restaurants have super friendly staff. There are many others including a weirdly named one : Bazaar Meats! BUT, I adore Jose Andres as a chef .. and where as I did not try this restaurant.. I am dying to on my next visit! The gym is awesome and the Foxhall POOL! Is more awesome ! The monorail is also great for connection to the strip. All in all, I was happy with my stay here .. It's not the main steam hotels on the strip.. but it's still pretty stylish and a little less in cost.. and you get Starwood points! Besides .. most of the time in Vegas you need a safe , clean place that's close to lay your head .. :)",10,8,11

The bad reviews are real. I didn't believe the bad reviews and booked regardless...BAD choice!

I was here for a conference. I was super tired and was just trying to sleep. I was locked out of my room with an explanation that due to security reasons I was unable to access my room (which had my stuff inside of it). I went back to the hotel lobby 3 times, spoke to 4 different people including the manager who had me go back to wait outside the room for the head of security to open the door. After a total of nearly 60 minutes I was finally in my ""upgraded room.""

Then, I find that my upgraded room key also doesn't work and find that the bedroom doesn't have A\/C vents. So, the bedroom portion of the suite is hot. 

I communicated to hotel management and provided the opportunity for the hotel to make it better but was thoroughly disappointed. I was offered an ""upgraded"" room and a free dinner, no thanks! There was no follow up, no phone call from a manager, no sense of a real attempt to retain a customer. Hey, maybe remove the resort fees on my charge? Nope!

For the amount of hotels in Vegas and for it's known financial struggles you would think they would want to keep all their customers at any cost.

I will NEVER be returning to the SLS Las Vegas. I have been valued and treated with much more respect at the many other hotels in Vegas.",0,0,0

Check this out: 

I checked into my room, and the room was dirty. I called the front desk to speak to the manager on duty, he was able to move me to the LUX tower where the rooms are a lot more nicer. After changing rooms, to the lux tower, and making sure this time around the room was clean? Will guess what the room was again dirty, this time I found hair in the sheets. I was disgusted, called the front desk again to notify them, and now I'm checking into the third room. They gave me the same room type, and a $25.00 food and beverage credit for the inconvenience and a resort fee credit for my first two nights. I planned on staying for 4, but after all of this I wanted to change hotels, and cancel the remaining of my stay.

I spoke to the front desk managers, who I don't think have enough experience and can use more training on how to deal with situations like this. They were not very helpful or generous. 

After making over 7 phone calls, and waiting 20 mins - 2 hrs for a phone call in return about what can be done for me, I than wanted to speak to the property manager about my experience with the staff, and service.

After waiting for a manger to get in contact with me, I finally heard from James who is the property manager. He was able to hear me out and understand where I was coming from, he moved me to another room which was a little larger, for now the 4th time, and comped our entire stay. 

After speaking to James, I think we are all not perfect and with him correcting the situation, I will plan my next visit and give this hotel another chance. This time I will book directly with him. The second star is for James (BTW).

It has a  young vibe to it. An industrial look to the rooms. I stayed in the story tower. The bed base and the couch light up. Which is kinda a trip. Also the layout of the room was weird. Every thing was just totally different than im used to. I thought it was cool. Older people might nit like the concrete ceilings and lighting effect. I would recommend to any one 21 to about 35 ready to party. Not really kids or older crowd. Only thing i really disliked was there key system. You have to use a hotel key to go up and down the elevator. Similar to palace station which is also annoying. But what made this one worse you don't slide the card in and out of a  card reader. You have to hold it near a sensor until it turns green then you have 5 seconds to press your floor. They should explain this more when checking in. I was pretty sober and struggled until i figured it out. I was not the only person to have this problem. I helped a couple people figure it out. Having attendants by the elevator helps a little. They should be  in the elevator. I didn't have problems with customer service like others. I was treated what i would see as normal from a hotel as a guest. I went to the kiddie pool upstairs and that was cool too. Over all i had a good experience. Just hate the key system.,0,0,0

When we checked into our room, it was dusty and looked like no one had wiped the room down in a few days, understandable if the room had been vacant for awhile but still unacceptable for paying customers. We called the front desk and they moved us to another room in the same wing.
This room was even worse than the first. There was pubic hair, yes you read that right, PUBIC HAIR, on the night stand by the bed. This time we took all of our bags and headed down to the front desk, which if you're ever been to Vegas you know was a small journey in itself. They moved us to another wing of the hotel and this time the room was clean and much more visually appealing. They did not comp any of our nights but offered a $25 credit and then a $50 credit the second time it happened. 
The rest of our stay was ok. The Foxtail pool is nice but it opens late and closes early. The standard hotel pool is ok but not very sexy and def not what you would expect if you've ever visited the SLS in Miami. The food at the 24 hour diner type restaurant wasn't great but wasn't bad. 
The best thing this hotel has going for it is Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres. It's one of the best restaurants I've eaten in Vegas. The service is exceptional and the food is really memorable. But you don't have to stay at the hotel to experience this and I wouldn't, ever again. When we checked out, we had to literally argue with the front desk manager about the credits we received because of the dirty rooms they stuck us with when we first checked in.

We were served a light breakfast in the mornings and the afternoon lunches were really good. Food choices varied by day. 

Room was small but bed was comfortable and sheets were clean. Bathroom was clean but didn't have much counter space. Housecleaning was stingy with the soap, tp, and towels so had to call a couple times. Minibar items were expensive. 

Thinking this place has been renovated not too long ago as I could see some spots outside the door that weren't painted over very well. 

Casino area is smaller compared to other hotels which I liked. It was never very busy and easy to find open machines and tables. There's also quite a few places to eat or have a drink inside the hotel. There's a pool\/night club in the hotel that caused a lot of lobby congestion Friday night but also made for great people watching from the bar. 

Hotel also has shuttle service but I didn't use it. I didn't have time to check out the spa or the pool either.

Prior stays, I loved the hospitality! Maybe because they were trying to prove themselves as a new hotel\/hot spot in Las Vegas.  
Anyways, prior visits were always so welcoming and accommodating to any and all of my needs (never had any issues).

But this past visit was very different.  

I have had the experience to book prior reservations in the World Tower, as well as the World Tower suites and loved every inch of these rooms!
So with my experience and love for these rooms, I re-booked the World Tower double room on June 9, 2017.  Reservations made for Saturday July 8, 2017-Monday July 10, 2017. 

Saturday, July 8, 2017 comes, and we get to the hotel around 11:30pm.  I am greeted by receptionist Janice.  She asks me if I still need a double bed room, I answered ""yes.""  Then she continues to tell me that there are no rooms available, but that she can accommodate me in a king bed room with a roll away bed.  I of course told her that was not going to work.  I began to ask her how is it that a room I booked a month prior, already paid for, is not ready 8.5 hours after check in time?!? Her response was that the rooms are not guaranteed and it is a first come first serve basis.  If we choose to take the 1 King bed and a roll away, she will be able to move us to a double bed room the next day.  Being that it is already the end of Saturday and we are leaving by 12pm Monday, that was not an option.  We were looking to be settled and comfortable, especially not to be sleeping on a roll away bed.  She continued to try to explain to me that there were absolutely no rooms available and that there was nothing she can do.  I insisted that she spoke to somebody that can do something.  She grabbed my id or credit card from her computer swiftly and gave me a sarcastic remark that the room is not guaranteed.  I requested that she showed me on my reservation where it says that the room I booked is at a first come first serve basis and not guaranteed.  She ignored those requests and went somewhere to speak to somebody.  She returned and informed me that she can put us in the story room.  She failed to mention that the square footage would be smaller, as well as the layout\/decor of the room. 

When we waked into our room it was completely different from the double rooms in the World Tower.  The ceiling looked like it was never painted.  The sink was outside the bathroom, which looked like a small kitchen sink.  No mirrors inside the bathroom.  The lighting is horrible.  Lastly, the room indeed felt smaller compared to what I am always use to during my stays.

I had no energy nor time to deal with the situation, so I decided to handle it during check out.

So, Monday July 10, 2017 comes and it is time to check out.  I was greeted my front desk receptionist Cesar (who is an amazing employee and handled the situation very professionally).  He ensured to explain to me the difference between the rooms, apologized for any negative treatment, and offered to comp the resort fee ($72.56).  I agreed.  Since I booked through a third party, I was told to file a claim through them in regards to obtain the difference between the rooms.  Since I paid for a larger room with a better layout and was placed in a smaller room with no explanation.

I went ahead and called the front desk manager, Kendall, the next day, Tuesday July 11, 2017.  He apparently had no information on what took place and he too explained to me the same thing Cesar did.  He also insisted that if I choose to return I will get some kind of compensation or upgrade.  But he did also explain to me that the Story tower room (the smaller one that I did not book, but was placed in) is actually $20 more per night due to including a ""package.""  I asked him to explain what the package entailed, being that I never received it, and he never explained what that package included which caused the room to be placed at a high value than the larger rooms in the World tower.

At this point, I was over the situation.  I went ahead and contacted the third party I placed the reservations with, and filed a claim.  All done right? NO.

I then check my credit card bill (credit card I placed to hold the room at the time of check in) and there was a charge of $72.56 from SLS on July 12, 2017, two days after check out!  This is ridiculous.  I personally received a receipt from Cesar at the time of check out showing that I would only be charged for the in-room dinning, and to top it off I declined that they charge anything on the credit card they had on file, and gave him my debit card instead to charge.  So they made an unauthorized charge to my card! A charge they said was waived!  So of course I called back, spoke to Diego and he waived the fee (""again"").

It seems to be a mess over there.",1,0,0

I signed up for SLS with a rated of 65.00 per day (not including taxes) for the trade shows.

I was excited to be in the SLS, took photos of the room and even told a friend that during our next vacation, we should stay here. 
Not anymore! 
Upon waking up I discovered I was charged nearly 700.00. When I called and spoke to a Diego at the front desk, he was extremely condescending, rude and passive aggressive. He then placed me on hold (without telling me) and I waited for 15 minutes before finally hanging up. I then went downstairs and spoke to a Mallurey, who had a pleasant tone, but didn't seem to care at all with what I surprised with. Instead, she replied with, ""Any hotel you stay at...the Wynn for example will charge that much."" When I explained to her that my email confirmation made no note of the outrageous extra charges, she asked to see my phone to view my email, scanned for a two minutes before admitting that those charges indeed were not noted. Still she could could not help me, and instead offered to check me out; but let me know that I would still be charged. 
Finally she gave me the number for a rep to assist me instead. And I would have much had her do that than to listen to snide remarks instead. 

Oh and btw, there was a gentleman checking in as I was speaking to Mallurey who was also surprised at the extra charges that he wasn't aware of as well. Clearly SLS should tell their customers this, opposed to surprising them the next day.

Oh and future guests, make sure you request a copy of your receipt! I checked in 1am groggy and exhausted and didn't even realize they do not give copies of what you sign. When I questioned Mallurey about this, she stated that 'they do not give receipts unless the guests requests a copy.",1,0,0

There are a couple restaurants like the Griddle, Umami Burger, Ku Noodles, Cleo, Bazzaar Meats and 800 Degrees Pizza. We only got to try one of the restaurant which was Cleo. I left a separate review for this restaurant on their Yelp page. 

Overall, our stay was pretty okay. The biggest problem I have with this hotel is the location. We spent probably over $100 the whole weekend for just the taxis because our friends stayed elsewhere on the Strip. I probably wouldn't stay here again, it was just a once time experience.",1,0,0

Some have complained that it seems a bit reshuffled from the old Sahara, but I think the updated design and clean smell and new infrastructure are modern, well designed, and alluring.

The biggest complaint is that the property is relatively new and doesn't have a ton of traffic.  The restaurant by Andres is amazing, the casino is nice, the service seems okay, but there aren't many people here so you don't get a vibe of it being a ""popular"" place.  The crowd looked nice, though, and I'm sure it will pick up.  I would give them a try for a hotel stay as well.",2,1,1

They have these huge full wall mirrors that have lights on the outside that actually illuminate the entire room. The mirrors are really really really cool. 
The pool at SLS is called Fox tail and it usually has great music and the great mid pool bar. I happen to be at the pool on a weekend they were giving out free noncarbonated Smirnov's so there was plenty of free drinks to go around - awesome!
The gambling floor has many great tables that start at $10 so you can stretch your money along way. They also have a highroller section if you are a Baller looking to prove it. The nightclub at SLS is also call fox tail and generally brings out a great hip-hop crowd.

Pros:  Excellent customer service, hip, well-designed rooms and common (public) areas, comfortable beds, large TV's, safe, good food, great room prices, casino

Cons:  Broken elevator to garage, no mini-fridge or microwave in room, parking a little confusing, small rooms, minor stains on different surfaces


The Details:

OK, so I wrote a review about a month ago, before we even stayed here, because the customer service that I received from this place, when I contacted them with some questions, was extraordinary (thank you Michaela)!  Now I'm writing another one to review our actual stay.  Let me first start by saying that the awesome customer service continued once we arrived.  There wasn't much of a line when we got there, as it was pretty late, so that was nice.  Then the Registration\/Front Desk person who helped us (Michelle) was very knowledgeable, helpful, and courteous.  She even gave us a late checkout at no extra charge since that's not a popular time of year to travel (a week before Thanksgiving) and so they weren't completely full (thank you Michelle!).  Our room was on a high floor, so it was really quiet.  The hotel itself was really hip and cool!!  I loved The Monkey Bar across the hall from the registration desk.  Cracked me up every time I walked by it.  The rooms were quite small, but very well designed, and since we only stayed in the room to sleep and get ready anyway, it wasn't that big a deal.  We stayed in the World Tower, and the room we had was actually bigger than the rooms in the Story Tower, so I can just imagine how tiny those are.  The rooms in the Lux Tower varied in size, but the designs looked phenomenal.  If we were planning on staying in the room a lot, I probably would have shelled out more cash for the upgrade, but since it was just a quick weekend trip, I figured why spend the extra money, when we could spend it gambling in their casino instead :-).  Now, for the most important part of any hotel room (to me at least)...the bed.  Their beds are very comfortable...not the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, but very close.  We were, however, disappointed that there wasn't a mini fridge and microwave for all the leftovers we had from all the good restaurants we ate at on site, but at least there was a safe.  They had a little box in the room with different snacks in it for purchase (they wanted way too much...so no thanks), and a refrigerated mini bar...neither of which allowed you to move any of the items for more than a few seconds if you weren't going to buy it, or they would charge you anyway.  There was a small stain on my pillow, one on the wall, and a small hot pink one on the white bathroom counter, as well as a broken tile in the shower which were all a little tacky, but really not a big deal.  The parking was a bit confusing, but we managed.  Really, the only totally bad thing we experienced was that the elevator to the garage when we were leaving was out of order, so we had to lug our nearly 50 lb bag up 5 flights of stairs to get to our car on the 5th level.  Overall though, it was a really fun and enjoyable time, and the good totally outweighs the bad by far.  I definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you like hip luxury for an affordable price.",0,0,0

First impression was the lobby smell which was a cologne like smell and the modern appeal .  I was at the hotel for a room party during Las Vegas Pride after a pool party at the Lux pool.  The hotel room main color was white and look sleek, updated and modern.  Beware of the fully stocked room fridge and snacks... They are not complimentary.  The room hosts were under the impression that if the fridge door was open for an extended amount of time there was an automatic $30 room charge for usage... Oh yeah and that it may charge according to weight? 
I enjoyed the Lux pool party, but I had great company, an exceptional bartender, and sights to be seen.  Pluses were the outdoor water mist contraptions above the bar and bar snacks available.  Minuses were no beach chairs and the sunblock at the hotel convenience store was $13 for a travel size.All seating for the event was for cabana rental only, most folks sat by the pools edge on towels.
The 800degree pizza place inside the casino is my new favorite pizza place in las vegas!  Brick oven flamed personal size pizzas that cook in about a minute or two.  The ingredients were fresh.. I tried spicy meatball. The meatballs were made of grass fed beef. Super Nom.  I definitely need to write a review for that place.

What, the acronym doesn't match? Well, it doesn't f*cking matter, because you should avoid this place like the f*cking plague.

Here is a (too long) list of things that went wrong during our less-than-48-hours stay:

1. The elevator in the attached parking structure broke down TWICE for extended periods of time.

2. LiFE Nightclub didn't let anyone in until about 11:30 Friday night despite a HUGE line outside because of an isolated power outage.

3. THERE WAS NO HOT WATER FOR AT LEAST 6 HOURS ON ONE OF THE NIGHTS. THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF F*CKING VEGAS WINTER AND YOU HAVE NO HOT WATER?! SERIOUSLY?!

4. Despite all of the above, it still took me and my dad hours of bitch-mayhem at the front desk to get our ridiculous $28\/night resort fee waived.

5. Housekeeping was EXTREMELY cheap. Used up toiletries were NOT replaced the second day.

I would give this place zero stars if Yelp allowed it. However, since I'm forced to give it at least one star, I will say that the hotel rooms do have cool illuminated infinity mirrors. But that's it.

Where other companies implode old hotels and rebuild something new and magnificent, SBE only slightly remodeled the old Sahara.

THE GOOD:
located down the strip, away from the hustle and bustle. Pool was low key, easy to access, and the casino floor was quiet. Loved the ambiance with its unique and funky feeling. Rooms were well maintained and clean. Free parking and wifi ( but there's a resort fee, so you end up paying it anyways) I especially loved the shower products! The 800degrees pizza stop was delicious and fair priced. We also ate at Umami burger and found it to be an okay option. 

THE BAD:
room was small, views were of nothing and the pool was legit ice cold. It was 90 degrees on our second day and we lounged by the pool during the afternoon. If you got too hot, you would have to do a polar bear plunge to cool off. It was that flipping cold. The computers went ""offline"" and the pool staff didn't know how to function. We tried to order a basic sandwich but it turned into such an ordeal we grabbed my info and left. CONSTRUCTION starts at 6am.... and can be heard loudly from rooms. If I had been warned that construction crews were working, I would be more apt to be understanding. I wasn't. Instead I was sleeping soundly and was awoken by the Beeping and banging of construction equipment.

In addition there was sloppy housekeeping (one bath towel in the room) and room service that took over 30 minutes and didn't have what was requested.

PROS:
-Very attentive and friendly staff at the front desk
-The Griddle is the best breakfast in town
-The main casino bar is flanked by an amazing LED screen
-Plastic bed lights up... VERY cool!

CONS
-Location: not near anything
-I requested a non-down comforter three times over the course of two days and it never showed up.
-Main casino bar is small and always mobbed and nowhere to sit.
-Rooms are industrial-chic, and feel that way.  Cold, charmless.
-The sink, bathroom and shower use sliding doors to access, a sloppy design.

I asked them to store frames containing important documents while I stayed at the hotel. I made sure they were marked fragile and followed the staff back to make sure the cart was placed in a safe place. The largest frame was bubble wrapped and had a blanket around it for extra protection. When I came to pick up the frames at check out, the corner of the large frame was damaged. The frames had been shuffled around and protecting blanket was half off. SLS refused to accept responsibility, claiming it could have happened before I gave it to them and there was no way to prove it. The security officer even had the nerve to ask me why it was not more protected despite the double layer of protection I placed around it. I asked SLS to review the video of the storage room, but there was an obscured blind spot that conveniently did not allow them to see what happened and thus said they were not responsible. This review is not financially driven, as I can easily buy another frame; this was written based on principle.

Not sure - but it was just a poor first experience at SLS that I'm hard-pressed to recommend to any travelers, even for the good deals they've been pumping out recently.  

A few of the problems I had including some general negatives about the hotel itself.  First off was the bad odor that came from the restroom vent.  After the first night when we woke up, there was a strong odor of weed coming from the restroom vents which didn't go away.  This was further complicated when we asked an electrician to check it out (had to go downstairs to ask because no one was picking up at guest services).  When we came back a few hours later, as asked, we were told that someone checked but on the computer, they were not given any notes\/updates so we had to go check again and the stench was worse than ever (in a non-smoking room).  We had to go back down again to finally be able to move rooms after also being told several times that they were at capacity and unsure if they could do much for us.  Which kind of goes into the second problem - just a poor sense of customer service - at least with the people we had to deal with.  This leads into the third problem which was WiFi.  If you have a Macbook, apparently, your computer is very glitchy on their network and for me, basically rendered it impossible to go online and do work from my room or anywhere in the hotel.  I called several times about this and in the process of an hour, was finally told that I wouldn't be able to go online and I had to ask where to go outside of the hotel to work.  

Other more general problems include - a small main pool (when you can, aim for Foxtail instead which was free for guests on Friday\/Sunday), being pretty far north on the strip (you'll be taxi-ing\/driving to the main part), terrible elevators (when we were checking out, only two elevators were working and on our elevator, when we were on the 27th floor, we literally stopped on each floor) and a lack of many people later at night.  

A few of the positives - if you're a fan of any of the SLS restaurants or SoCal food chains, you'll be in luck as many of them are here in relatively good form like Bazaar to Umami.  The space isn't that bad too looks-wise.  The bar has a cool LED ceiling and everything is fairly clean.  Rooms in general have a nice white look too and for couples, the LUX suite is probably what you want with a lot of sexy opportunities all over (for non-couples, do be aware that these suites are probably the worst in terms of privacy).  And finally, the rooms are cheap at the moment if you look far ahead enough and on different sites.  

Again, not sure if it's just a series of bad luck experiences that made my initial experience here one of the worst I've had in a Vegas hotel, but it's tough to recommend after what I've been through.  We'll have to try again someday...",3,1,1

There was hardly any room to set down your belongings, like make up and a curling iron.  Felt like a cheap re-vamp of an old hotel.

We love the SLS hotel in West Hollywood so we thought being the same brand this hotel would be classy, trendy, sophisticated and beautiful.  If I could give them zero stars I would.  First; it used to be an old Vegas casino and they put over $300 million in renovations.  Well, something went majorly wrong and they either ran out of money or got embezzled because the entire casino and hotel rooms are a joke.  The casino area was built to look like a street alley it's dark, ugly and attracts nasty crowds.  I was shocked at the difference between the crowd at SLS west Hollywood and the Vegas one.  The rooms were the smallest we have ever experienced.  They had sliding doors from the bathroom that if you opened the bathroom you covered the sync, so when my husband got out of the bathroom and moved the sliding door he hurt my arm as I was washing my hands.  The bathroom was colored in a nasty mustard yellow. You could tell it was the old tile just repainted.  They had not switched the blinds still the old nasty blinds that didn't work. I was shocked that they had a Fred Siegel selling $500 shoes but something did not make sense as they did not attract the crowds that would be able to afford that.  The bed was made of plastic trying to look fancy modern but instead look like a cheap piece of plastic.  Oh and it lights up if that is why we paid the high rates.  

Overall, the bars, casinos, machines reminded me of a Golden Nugget feel and the whole casino was so dark trying to look like a cool alley but instead gave you an eerie feel.  I felt I was at a cemetery.  Later on we read reports that the owner was using heavy drugs as he negotiated (or did not) this deal, and you could feel total abandonment, lack of care and special touches when you walk in the door.  

The one nice thing is the registration let us check in early because we were there for a wedding. 

Vegas is all about making you feel like a million dollars.   You will feel ripped off and nothing like a million bucks.  I recommend you take your money somewhere else and you do not drive to this part of town.  

I feel really bad for all the investors in this project who just threw their money in the trash.  Maybe a good lesson for people to wake up and research who they do deals with,",1,2,0

I've stayed in almost every hotel on the strip, so I thought i would try this place since it's new. 

I'll start by staying I'm familiar with the SLS brand and that is what initially drew me towards it.

Pros:
All the restaurants are fantastic. Every meal i had here was great.

Super easy to get to convention center. I was staying here for an event and it was probably the easiest I've ever been able to get to the CC.

Clean, New. Doesn't smell like an old ashtray.


Cons:

Rooms are tiny for Vegas. I've had bigger rooms in Manhattan. And i was given an upgrade.

No Bathtubs... Really? this is where you cut corners on building costs? It's vegas, put in a fucking bathtub.

Customer Service seems way understaffed and inconsistent.

SLS in Beverly Hills is top notch, and Miami is strong aso.  I'm really not sure why they decided to open in this particular location, as the north end of the Las Vegas strip is really dead. The neighbor is Riviera and Circus Circus so walking around is really out of the question. The other issue is I feel like the property is much too big for a boutique brand such as SLS, I think they're designers tried their best but there was just too much ground to cover so it just has kind of a weird unfinished vibe on the first level. I paid $54 for my room on Hotwire, so obviously I am not complaining about the price. The service is fine and the food was fine as well. My opinion is that SLS should have gone where the Delano went, in the South Strip near City Center and the more popular properties. Next time I come to Vegas I will not stay here, even at a $50 rate, it's just too far away from the other hotels and just a little too vacant.  I will stay at SLS in LA but whoever did this selection in Las Vegas did us and their brand a disservice.",0,1,0

First off, I booked a Lux SLS King Suite-Pool View (955 sf) for $109 a night (not including the $28 per day resort fee). I clicked on a link on Facebook, and there was a glitch with SLS's booking system, so every room was listed at $109 per night. I did some ""research"" to figure out which room was the biggest, and selected the SLS King Suite...SCORE!!!

I don't normally stay so north on the strip. I've stayed at the Wynn (twice), Palazzo, Aria (this is my favorite hotel), Mandalay Bay, former PH Tower, and New York New York (don't ever do it!). Anyway, for $109 a night for a suite that would normally cost around $340-$450 a night, I told myself...chance it. Besides, SLS had just opened a few weeks prior, so it still must have that new sparkle.

I had an early flight into Vegas and was relieved that the guy at check-in (sorry, I forget his name, but he was a skinny, friendly Asian man) let me check-in at 9:00 a.m. on a Tuesday. Prior to arriving, I did e-mail reservations to inquire about an early check-in, so that could have something to do with that. Regardless, I was thankful.

Although I was discouraged to stay at this hotel thanks to the less than stellar reviews on TripAdvisor and Yelp, I was surprised when I opened the door to my suite. The room was big, clean (except for several hairs on the canvas-covered couch in the living room), and cold. Okay, it wasn't cold at first, but I lowered the thermostat in the living room and bedroom to turn it into an ice box!

I had no problems with noise or the a\/c as many people have mentioned in their reviews. The a\/c didn't keep me awake at night, as a matter of fact, I spent most of the day on the second day in bed. Bad, I know, when there's so much to do in Vegas, but I was on vacation! 

Anyway, onto the good. I loved the ceiling mirror, even though my clothed ""selfies"" didn't look that sexy with the effects of gravity. For couples or anyone wanting to keep what happens in Vegas, in Vegas, the mirror had a wonderful allure. The shower was also really nice with the dual shower heads. There was one normal shower head, and another rain shower head. As funny as it sounds, it's nice to have water falling on you from different directions after a long day (or night) in Vegas. The bed was also comfy, and it was nice to have a separate living room and toilet. 

The numerous restaurants in the hotel were also a huge plus, even though I only dined at Umami Burger. If you like your burger medium or remotely cooked, I'd suggest ordering your burger well done. I ordered my burger medium, and I swear it was still mooing. I had a hard time eating it, but managed. 

Now for the bad...the parking garage was horrible. There are two different parking garages, one off of Las Vegas Boulevard and another off of Paradise. I opted to park in the garage off of Paradise, since I mainly used the freeway to get anywhere. The signage in the parking garage is bad or drivers aren't too bright because A LOT OF PEOPLE were exiting through the entrance and driving down the wrong way. I imagine this will cause some accidents in the near future since the one-way parking garage isn't big enough for two cars. One more downside, although one garage elevator was working during my stay, I nearly got stuck in it when I was leaving the hotel. I pressed a bunch of buttons and prayed. Fortunately, the elevator started moving again, but I can't imagine what it would be like to get stuck in the air-conditioner-less elevator in 90 degree weather for a good 30 minutes or hour while someone tries to get you out. When in doubt, take the stairs. Another downside...the toilet in the main bathroom got clogged during my first night in the hotel...thanks Umami! Anyway, it took more than two hours and two calls to finally get someone to unclog it. A technician unclogged my toilet, but left water and other things on the floor, and a maid did not come down as he promised. I had to call again to request a maid to come and clean the mess. Luckily, one did come while I was out, but the whole toilet ordeal cost me $20 in tip. Thank goodness for that second bathroom! So, my advice is when in doubt, give the toilet a courtesy flush! Maybe SLS didn't upgrade the plumbing during renovations.

Overall, I did enjoy my stay at SLS, but would I stay again? If the price was right, but in terms of the room, gambling, and dining, Aria is still my number one!",2,1,1

Yes, their location sucks... it is at the very far end of the strip so if you plan on getting around the Vegas strip by just walking from your hotel, I don't suggest you stay here. A lot of people dock a star because of this but, really, you can't fault them for the location especially if you did your research and knew how far you will be from the center but still decided to stay here. 

Service was excellent. We booked a room at the World Tower but they surprised us with a complementary room upgrade at the Lux Tower. Talk about getting a good deal. And we actually thought the rate we got for the World Tower was already a steal at $50 a night. Instead, we got something better than a steal! Check in was a breeze, there was a line but it didn't take long.

Our room looks so lovely. It has that French Victorian era vibe..a little bit creepy because of this lady's picture on the drape at the head of the bed but lovely nonetheless. The room is small compared to other Vegas hotel rooms but it comes with the basics plus more- comfortable king bed with white linens and plush pillows, complementary Ciel bath products, slippers, robes, champagne glasses, even a cute laundry bag. There's also a couch that can easily seat about 6 people. I liked the bathroom too even though there's no tub and I hate tiled floors. It's all white so it looked pristine. One drawback though is there are no closets in the room, just drawers with a space for you to hang your clothes.

We wanted to do a late check out hoping we could add an additional hour of sleep but they told us there will be no late check outs for that day. Nevertheless, check out was easy...just had to access account overview on the TV and click check out! You can also review your charges from there.",1,2,1

I'm a huge fan of room service. I get it in every hotel I'm in. Unfortunately, SLS serves their room service food in togo containers so it was very....unattractive. My $28 salmon was tossed into a cardboard box with a smattering of sauce and asparagus on it. Not impressed. The $8 chicken noodle soup was average and for the price, it was tiny and poured in a crappy togo container. But thats besides the point.

This past weekend, I was struck down by an awful stomach bug and was throwing up for 3 days. Let's start with the good.

In the midst of my misery, I called room service to order some chicken noodle soup. Melissa picked up the phone and immediately heard my groans of pain. Not only did she send up the soup, but she even included a pot of hot water, honey, lemon slices, and saltine crackers. I called again after for some tea and again, she included saltines, lemon, honey, and hot water. She even paused the call to ask her colleagues if they had any remedies for my stomach bug. She said the wait is about and hour and 45 mins because they were very busy but she would rush it for me since I was pretty much dying. It was up in my room within 15 minutes. She was divine and went above and beyond to try to help me. She's a godsend! Thank you Melissa!

Now for the bad. I encountered another room service operator that sounded like she breathed dragons breath and was powered on the tears of orphans and miscarriages. Her name was Yvonne and ""unhelpful"" would be a compliment if used to describe her. She got my order wrong and immediately got defensive when I called about it to be replaced. ""Ok well we're going to make sure to take the dish you have now, just so you know."" Yeah, thats fine. Stop acting like this $12 dish is being taken out of your paycheck. The second encounter I had with her was just as unpleasant. I had gone down to Ku Noodle to pick up some take out but they forgot to give me silverware. I called room service and the queen herself, Yvonne picked up. I told her my situation and she said she'd have to charge a $7 delivery fee for bringing up silverware. I told her thats ridiculous and she said she'd put me on hold. During this hold, my food went cold, I drank all my tea, President Obama was reelected and has already gotten drunk off of celebratory champagne, and i finished all the Seasons of Breaking Bad and emailed Bryan Cranston on yet once again impressing the shit out of me. I hung up, called back, Yvonne picked up, and I told her ""So you want me to pay $7 for a mistake that a staff member made because they FORGOT to pack silverware?"" She sighed and said ""Ok we'll send you up some silverware now.""

I could've dissected a human body and determined the time of death by the time the silverware came and APPARENTLY in this odd world at the SLS, SPOONS don't exist. I got two sets of knives and forks. Knives and forks for my soup. Thanks, Yvonne. You're awesome.

Unfortunately, I will be staying here more often for work throughout the year and I can only hope to be helped by Melissa from now on. But we all know that miracles don't exist. Oh well.",7,15,6

I received nothing but excellent customer service during my stay and to me that's more key. The best advice I can give is for someone to truly have an open mind if you intend to stay here. 

I booked this hotel via hotels.com and was made aware of the ""resort"" fee (which to me is a joke but seems common on the strip) but was not made aware of the daily deposit fees. $150\/day was pretty hefty to me mainly because I didn't plan\/budget for it.

 I was being checked in by Albert whom was more than accommodating. I was more upset because of the failure of disclosure via hotels.com. Staying 3 days that's a $450 deposit.  That's $100+ what I paid for the rate to stay! But Albert spoke with a mgr and lowered that amount. He didn't have to do that. He could have simply handed me my documents back and advised I provide another form of payment (aka take your broke you-know-what home and come back when you step your coins up!)  My birthday weekend in Vegas was about to be ruined and he saved it. I thanked him then, and want to say many thanks again in this review. 


I stayed in the World Tower. It was supposed to be a high floor. Maybe the 11th floor is considered high but not to me if it goes 20+ floors. But with all the mix up with the deposit amount I said screw it. I was on the smoking floor. There's trash can\/ash tray combos by the elevator when you enter and exit the floor. The door keys are touch sensor, no need to swipe. The room is full of mirrors so unless you like that sort of decor, then stay away. I loved it. But then again I do love my reflection...I did have to request a ashtray since one wasn't in my room. It was brought to my door quickly with a smile.  I needed a jack bad after that deposit mixup!


Random monkey artwork everywhere.Im not sure what that's about.Seems too hard an attempt at being pop\/modern. But to me this is a boutique\/trendy style hotel that has yet to find it's true niche. When I realized it just opened within this past year I was more open to where it could go vs where it is now. Atmosphere is a mix of casual young ppl and some smug ones but I was in my own world myself and I kind of liked that I cud be here. Secluded\/quieter end of the strip. Cabs\/cars R a must for the more lively part. 10-15 cab ride to central strip area. 

Small casino floor which appealed to me because I don't really gamble. But I did take advantage of THE CODE. I won $5 free play (random winning spin at a slot machine selects your free play amount) which I turned into $25 and just decided to cash out and eat with it instead of be in the slot machine zone and blow it all. The lights can be mesmerizing a bit. 

Food:
800 degrees is awesome. Affordable. Probably the only non overpriced section of the hotel to me. I had the blanco. Nom nom nom. Good eats and fresh. $7

Umami burger was good but I've had better. Not worth the $60 food bill for 1 burger, 6 wings, hot dog and two salads. I guess maybe I was expecting more since it's a burger joint...


The Perq had a ridiculously long line maybe because it's the only thing open before 11am it seems. But I passed on it and went to Hash House A Go Go for breakfast instead. Now THATS a line worth waiting in!


During my stay:
The valet was always pleasant and kind. Whenever I needed a cab they got one for me. And whenever my family picked or dropped me off they were nice in opening doors for me. If you have luggage make sure to come from the Paradise\/rear side instead of the main entrance. 

Housekeeping did a good job. I'm a simple person. I don't want new bedding everyday. Just make my bed. And replace my towels. There's a card in the bathroom with instructions on how you would like them to accommodate you. Place the card on the bedding if u want new bedding and if you want fresh towels simply don't rehang them. 
Some complained about the housekeeping but I'm sorry you gotta do a damn good job to keep these mirrors spotless. I'll take a random hair which likely came from housekeeping as I literally watched this lady clean my bathroom top to bottom when all I asked for fresh towels. It's almost like she couldn't help herself. Nonetheless she dumped my trash, wiped down the bar area, and sprayed deodorizer on the carpet to freshen it. The time in which they clean your room varies. One day my room was clean by the time I came back at noon. The next (the day I just described) she knocked during Katy Perrys halftime performance and she almost got shooed away but I really wanted fresh towels so she did her thing and cut the lights down for me to finish enjoying the TV. 
Oh the TV. It's personalized with your name. Soo cute to me. Basic cable channels. NBC. FOX. ESPN. BET. MTV. VH1 etc etc

I could go on and on but there's a character limit. If you're open minded get a good rate and stay here & see for yourself. Just be open minded. ;-)",1,1,1

Wish I could say better things about this place. About the only thing going for it is that it is new.
If you're here for vacation and don't have to be anywhere at a certain time, you'd probably be fine.
But if you're working and have a schedule to stick to, you're taking your chances.
There are constantly LONG lines everywhere.

i have been here 4 days now and still have not been able to have breakfast before having to be at work. There is 1 restaurant that has breakfast and there is consistently a 1+ hour wait. It is your only breakfast option. UNLESS you want to grab a croissant or yogurt to go from their coffee shop Perq. Of course, you're waiting an hour here to get even a simple cup of drip. 
A simple suggestion would be to have coffee thermoses so people could pour their own or have someone on staff acting as a ""coffee back"" (just there to pour coffee). But no. You must wait and wait and wait.
Get room service you say? Not an option for breakfast. What hotel with room service doesn't provide breakfast???
An issue with your room? Oh, there's a line at the front desk too. I've walked by mid week, weekend, 8am, 10pm and there is consistently a line of 10-20 people waiting to get help here.

If all you care about is a pretty, new hotel, friendly staff (Once you can talk to them) this is your place. If you want service, you won't find it. At least not for many, many, many hours. 

Good luck.",10,6,1

Despite reading an article about how since this hotel opened, it lost money instead of making money due to expectations not being met, I was still super excited because the SLS in Beverly Hills is absolutely breath taking.


Arrived Saturday night around 9:00pm. Outside of the hotel looks pretty sleek and modern. Weird, but I got lost going to valet. The front of the hotel where the pick ups and drop offs are isnt where you valet. I asked an attendant where is valet and he pointed to the structured parking. I pulled up in valet there, but realized I had to walk to the back to get to the real entrance. HUH?! So there I was, hauling my luggage to the front, but back door. Got in and was so disappointed at the decor. It was dark and not so lively. Felt dead and awkward. We stayed in the Lux tower. As the elevator opens you see weird monkeys on the side windows. As you are walking to your room, the creepy white grass looking paintings covers the walls. Once we got to our room I must say it was gorgeous. I loved the maria antoinette drop behind the bed. Luxurious white long sofa. Nice modern samsung flat screen. My favorite was the two shower heads in the shower! The room was overall spacious and very comfortable and clean. However, due to the lack of the luxurious feel of the casino, I'm not sure I'll be back.",1,2,1

The walls are thin so you hear everything next door (in my case squealing girls who thankfully sacked out just after midnight). The bed is super comfortable (but yes, against the window, which means cold air comes in) and the shower was fantastic. I stayed in the World Tower, which was an upgrade.

For me, location is a bit far but that's not something that can be helped. It was nice that there is a shuttle to and from the airport as well as to Planet Hollywood although it's only from 6am-7pm. We got dropped off at Planet Hollywood and were told that it makes a stop there 15minutes after the hour between 6-7pm. When we first went back to be picked up after we were done shopping, we called and were told a bus should be there at 1:15 it was 1:05pm, and waited until about 1:30pm and decided maybe they got there early and already left so we called the hotel and we're told that we may have missed them but another should be there at 1:50pm so instead of walking the strip some more until 2:15 we decided to stay. Well at 1:50, still no sign so we called and were told that they were mistaken and shuttle would be there at 2:15, which it finally came. It was a little frustrating as we waited there for about an hour for the shuttle due to misinformation.

The hotel room itself was nice, I loved the bathroom and how spacious it was. We were in the world tower and our room faced the Stratosphere so that was a nice view. The room felt very hip and edgy with the decorations and the photos in the elevator. There's security in front of the rooms and all you need to do is flash your room key, I didn't know that at first so was a little confused when I got stopped, it would be nice if the front desk had informed me. Also, it would've been nice to know you need your key to access the elevator, I stood there for a few minutes before I saw someone do it. 

The pools were nice, the foxtail is only 21+ and it got a little crazy but the Lux pool is more like a small lap pool and since the kids couldn't go in the foxtail, they were all in there. It was a little annoying as there were kids throwing a football in the water so it wasn't too relaxing either. All in all, it was a good price and the room itself was really nice and the amenities were great, but the shuttle could be improved.",2,1,2

My boyfriend and I needed a getaway and opted for the Vegas route. Prices were low and SLS was offering some cyber Monday deals. The place is more super hipstery and redone in a modern west Hollywood\/Miami vibe. Pulling from their old history as the Sahara casino in some old photos on the carpet which is cool it has awesome video behind the front desk and cool touches everywhere you look even if they are strange at least it's something different and new in Vegas which has been struggling to get a new resort casino off the ground since the recesh hit back in '07. I saw a lot of complaints from other yelpers about how small the gaming floor is. This seems like a strange complaint because how big do you need a gaming floor to be really?! Even if the gaming floors are huge it's just the same slots and tables repeated everywhere. This is an accessible size and a place small like this lets you interact with more staff and not get so turned around you can't find your room after a few too many keir royales. As far as food options this place is teeming with some of the best food all under one roof. Katsuya, umami burger, the griddle and Cleo all under all in walking distance of my room? My belly just about exploded! The rooms are super cool. Wish they had knocked down a few walls and made all the rooms a bit larger but the decor was on point and the only real complaint from me is that there was no closet in my room to store away some of our stuff (we don't travel lightly) I really like the little flap that protects the peephole from the inside. I don't know if anyone can actually see into other rooms from the outside of the peephole but that's a cool touch. Also the shower was amazing! Rain head from the top and then another from the side! Pretend your in a rainforest! We also checked out the nightclub LiFE on a Saturday which was crazy intense cool energy lots of spectacle and lighting to get you dancing with the DJ crowd, however bring hearing protection because it is really loud. We also enjoyed checking out the Sayers club which is their live entertainment venue, pretty cool lighting in there too but again very loud.

But I guess you get what you pay for and this was definitely NOT the luxury 5 star hotel that they try to convince you they are.  They are lacking the service you get at other hotels with the 4 or 5 star rating. We had 2 rooms in thr World Tower.  Here were my issues with our stay.

1. I wanted 2 connecting rooms. Other hotels allow you to guarantee connecting rooms for a small fee, however SLS doesn't even offer that service. 

2.  We get to our rooms and one is perfect, the other one literally smells like shit. I kid you not, even the bell boy bringing up our luggage said it was horrible. First time I called, they didnt even offer to switch us to a different room, they just sent up some guy to spray the room but after we went downstairs for an hour to go eat, we came back to the room and it smelled just as bad. We had to call 3 times to finally get a room switch.

3. Housekeeping is slow. Like wait an hour and a half for towels slow.

4. The room keys suck. They deactivate if they are next to your cell phone or credit cards. We literally had to get a new room key everytime because, guess what girls keep in their tiny purses...their credit cards, phone and room key.

5. I have no clue why I was charged a resort fee. Their pools were both closed, you can only use their spa if you purchase a service, i didnt see a gym at all, they have a VERY limited room service menu, etc. They are not a resort, they should not have resort fees.

6. The cocktail waitresses take forever to get you a drink. I dont know if it's because they are understaffed or what, but it should not take 30 minutes to get a drink.

7. Since it is a little off the strip, taxis are not as plentiful like they are at other places on the strip. We had to wait in line awhile a couple times because there were no taxis available.
----

The only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 is for the couple of people that did make our stay a bit more enjoyable. Namely a blackjack and roulette dealer and the bell boy who brought up some extra amenities for us because HE felt bad our room smelled even though the management didn't seem to care.

To sum it up, I did alot of gambling here, so if I get a comped room, I'd come back. But I would never pay full price for their rooms because in my opinion the location is not too convenient if you want to go to the strip and the service is just lacking.",2,0,0

My friend came out and met me at a bar. Bar service was good (that's where they got the second star).

When I went to leave they had left my car up front in valet because I wasn't going to be there long. Even though I could see my car they sent me to a remote location to ""scan my ticket"". Computer couldn't find my ticket & it was difficult to find a person to help me! Finally I got sent back to my original location & I got my car.

It seems to have improved slightly, but still has the most of the issues that I experienced the first time I was here. I noticed all the Fred Segal shops are gone now. I am not surprised as no one was shopping there.

One of the more noticeable improvements is the introduction of an airport shuttle service. The airport shuttle is in operation from 6am to 8pm. I don't understand why they can't extend those hours to those that actually come in the evening. For those who work, by the time they get into Vegas, they would have missed the shuttle. The nice thing about this shuttle is that it makes a pit stop on the way to the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood. The bad part is if you wanted a ride back to the SLS from the shops, you have to take it to the airport and then back to SLS which is a 45 minute ride. Perhaps they will extend the hours someday. They pick up at the airport at ""zero"" level. Look for the shuttle bus with SLS on it. 

I was in the World Tower again. The rooms are small as always. If you are staying by yourself or with a significant other in a king size bed, it is cozy. If you have (2) double beds, the room can be quite claustrophobic, hence, the abundance of mirrors to make the rooms appear larger. If you have more than 2 people, you should get an extra room for the additional occupants.

I would still strongly advise against meandering through the north part of the Strip as it is quite seedy. Take a cab\/uber to wherever you need to go or take the monorail. SLS is really far North of the strip. I realized that it is a hindrance when wanting to see the shows and drink\/dance at the popular nightclubs. You will spend more for transportation if you stay at the SLS.

The restaurants are wonderful at the SLS. They always have numerous promotions for food which can help the ease the pocketbooks.

Why is the internet so bad here? My internet AGAIN was intermittent where I had to tether to my phone to get reliable internet service. Aren't we paying for a resort fee for internet? With all the fees that they have collected, they should ensure that the internet is reliable for hotel guests.

As for housekeeping, I requested service at a specific time due to the fact that I was in the room the majority of the time working. Of course, after a two hour duration, no one came even though I was promised by housekeeping. I felt pretty shortchanged by housekeeping as they did the bare minimum to clean up my room.",9,0,1

Being a Las Vegas Local, may seem like I am being biased or sensitive on reviews, but just being at SLS will speak for it self. They spent so much money on advertising, hyping up the new resort by renovating a classic landmark casino in which was once called Sahara hotel.  Sadly with all the renovations or what has become, it sadly failed to deliver in giving honor to a classic Vegas time piece and destination.  Times have changed and obviously what goes up, must come down...but what gets rebuilt shouldn't always be the case.  This is what you get when you come to the SLS. 

Owned by SBE entertainment and known for their posh boutique luxury style and offering...the SLS is anything but that.  In the capital city of entertainment destination around the world, the kind of grand opening that the SLS delivered was more of a 99 cents store opening up at a local ghetto. (With all due respect...I do shop at 99 cents store) but to get to the point of their grand opening is that, why open up shop when you are not ready?!?  

Their carpets were all filled with wood and construction debris, the concrete pavement which was painted white were full of grease marks and over spray and was rather unpleasant. It reminded me of walking into  a model home being constructed.  

Now the concept is nice and in some cases, some decor was actually modern and intriguing but it leaves you with a feeling of emptiness and questions yourself...""that's it?!?""  I'm not sure what the interior decorator or designer was going through but in my opinion and point of view, as if they were going for a mix of modern and vintage at the same time, rather than being contemporary.  There was too much going on yet too little of it going on. (Confusing right?...that's what it is confusing!)

We all know casinos don't have windows and clocks for a reason, but the ambience is pretty dark and gothic like. Lighting was a fail...common this is Vegas...not a Seattle grunge night club. It may be good for those who rock ED Hardy or are into twilight (no offense again I've watched the whole twilight series) but check out the ceilings. It looks like you are entering a consignment warehouse. Even with SLS being crowded due to grand opening, I managed to walk the whole casino floor premises in a boring 15 minutes. 

SLS does offer some interesting restaurants and clubs but nothing on par with what MGM\/WYNN offers in house.  Prices on some of the upscale restaurants are not worth paying (unless you have cash to blow and don't give a $&@!) I'd rather take my business elsewhere. 

And what's up with the parking lot\/valet\/taxi staging area\/entrance? Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles could design a much better traffic flowing concept. This parking concept is literally an accident waiting to happen. My advice is be careful if you plan to visit and park. I suggest parking yourself instead if valet at least until they get their stuff together and that's if they do.  

I really do hope SLS succeeds.  This is my city and I would hate failure to happen, but the way it is going now does not look good.  They need to step it up, otherwise they will lose customers, especially locals. Sahara Hotel was actually more better and even had a nascar cafe with roller coaster. I just hope this isn't the end of it, otherwise it will be the end of it. SLS until you can provide a cleaner, more attractive and on par resort...I won't be coming back anytime soon. For that matter, I may not come back at all. 

1 star rating does not even do justice. If I could this rating would be negative.  So sad.",36,17,10

Pretty good amount of space, nice bedding. We ate at Bazaar Meats, and everything was excellent. The staff were great and the suckling pig sandwich was perfect. The Northside cafe served a nice breakfast selection as well. My only complaint is that during our entire stay, only one elevator worked. This was definitely inconvenient, and resulted in cramped elevator rides, 10 minute waits, and in some cases the elevator being so full that you had to wait for the next sole ride. I was expecting that the hotel would try to do something to make it up to the guests, whether it was a small as a complimentary cocktail or gambling credit, but no such luck. A 3.5 star rating would have been more appropriate, but because of how good everything else was I went with a 4 instead of a 3.

The SLS has highs and some potential lows...depending on ur needs. Clean rooms, clean air, upbeat\/hipster music and casino. Casino is slow during the day as there is no walk by traffic due to its far north location on the strip. We got a monorail pass for 3 days for $22\/piece...made location just fine.  Monorail fun clean and safe. Monorail ends at the SLS so pretty neat. Also, if ur somewhat practical with ur money and want value...bring a cooler filled with ice and a couple gallons of spring water...no ice machines on the floor... $7 room service delivery fee for ice is plain stupid. Free parking. Also, we paid $80\/night after bidding on Priceline...got hit with an undisclosed  $25\/night resort fee after securing the bid (ur bad,priceline). As the Resort fee $25 wasn't silly enough, they tack on a $3 resort fee tax...redic! They also take a $150 each night off ur credit card, and then put it back on if u don't get all heavy metal on your room. I'm not a frequent enough flier to vegas enough to know if this is common practice, but felt it a bit over the top. Some nice lil affordable places to eat in the SLS, but limited dining hours in the evening for the nicer ones. The grill, burger, and pizza places were all tastey and affordable. A couple of hip night clubs manage to bring in the L.A. young folks on the weekend. If u want NYNY or Ceasars palace type of all day all night extravaganza, the SLS is not for u. If u don't mind small but quirky, clean, hip rooms with light up couches\/furniture with mirrors on the ceiling and no bathtub, this will appeal. Drink service while gambling was lacking, even tho pit bosses and dealers were nice and accommodating, but I only gambled there 3 times in 3 days due to the slow booze service (we are talking 45 min-1 hour...even after asking pit bosses to intervene). Free booze is a heavy incentive to gamble in Vegas to me, and a non-negotiable to get my $. Overall, they've done a nice job rehabbing the Sahara, and I would stay at the SLS again, if the price was right. But I think I'd like a lil different experience next visit to Vegas.

We made reservations in March before all of the Memorial Day acts were booked, thinking as guests we would be able to access the pool anytime during our stay, but unfortunately that was not the case.  What made it even worse, the hotel had booked nothing but rap artists all weekend, which I'm ok with, but the crowd that the concert attracted was definitely questionable.  I think since the hotel is so far down the strip, they are getting desperate and beginning to cater to a specific demographic, which is not the demographic I really want to be surrounded by for a long period of time.  Let's just say all the halls in The hotel smelled like straight marijuana.

I must say though, the restaurant in the hotel called UMami Burgers is AMAZING!  You have to try the Ahi Tuna burger!  

The rooms in the hotel and kind of small and I actually had an outlet spark out at me when I tried to charge my phone, which almost shocked me.

First they put me in a handicap room over next to the peaking garage so all night I kept hearing cars honking and driving over the bump on the pavement . They said they didn't have any rooms available until the following day ( which was b.s. ) I called for room services several times I needed a fridge for medication and had to call multiple times for them to bring one ( many hours later ) 

Waitress took my ID to hold along w my credit card at the pool & upon bringing me the receipt to sign only gave me back my credit card . I didn't realize until I came back to LA and when I contacted the SLS they told me I can pay to have it shipped . Most hotels will send it to you as a curtsy , but I guess not this place. 

Overall terrible rooms super small looks like they just threw on some new wall paper , casino is bleh . 

Nothing like the SLS Beverly Hills at all!

My plane arrived early so we arrived at the hotel around 1130 am. They refused to let us check in early (check in is normally at 3) OK they didn't refuse they wanted to charge us 20.00 let me rephrase. 

20.00 isn't a huge some of money but it sort of just seemed tacky to ask a guest to pay that on top of the resort fee, security hold, cost of the room ect. I declined and I'm glad I did, they were willing to hold our bags and we were able to explore the strip...Once we got there... SLS may say it is located on the strip but it is NOT within walking distance. It is a few miles away from most places on the strip. We bought a bus pass for 22.00 which lasted 3 days and we needed it constantly to go back in forth to the strip which is where everything else is located. SLS may be good for a secluded stay or if you don't plan to go to the strip throughout the day but you will need to take a cab\/bus\/uber which will cost a little bit if you plan to stay a few days. The hotel has several restaurants such as 800 Degrees (Good pizza) and several others, the staff was courteous for the most part HOWEVER, please think twice before giving them your credit card information, they ask you for it upon check in to secure the room (in case of damage or in case you order room service ect.) They place an initial hold on my credit card and just as they promised after a couple of days the hold fell off HOWEVER upon checking my credit card when returning home I noticed my balance was much higher than it should have been SLS has placed a random $ 405.00 dollar charge on my credit card and it is still on there!! I returned from Vegas on 2-15-2016 today is the 2-19-2016 and this is unacceptable!! After leaving Vegas and spending lots of money anyhow on your trip, and having fun who amongst us can spare an additional $405.00 charge?? It took 2 days for anyone to call me back about the charge, on 2-17-2016 a woman from accounting called and said the charge was an ERROR and would be credited back to me with in a few business days. This is a very expensive error and I find it very unprofessional.

My first visit was only to check it out and play a little. I won on the slots and played a little Pai Gow - all the dealers were really friendly. We were comped a couple of buffets so we enjoyed dinner as well. Buffet had a good selection - a little bit of everything with an excellent assortment of desserts. 
Our second visit we stayed in the World Tower. Our room had two double beds - which were small - because they're DOUBLE beds. But it made for some closer nighttime snuggles so we didnt mind. The room are nicely decorated - everything was white and looked really clean. 
The only problem was at check in - there was a huge line to get checked in and only 3-4 agents assisting. So it seemed like it took a long time to get squared away however once it was our turn - we had rooms keys within minutes. So not too bad overall. They should just consider adding some backup help to alleviate the lines during high rush times. The last thing you want to do after traveling all day is to wait in line for your hotel room.

Although the LV location is different, I'm now glad we didn't go with SLS\/SBE as a whole, if customer service is this ridiculously hard to get a hold of.

The breakdown - we got a mailer for comp nights = awesome!  My mother was celebrating her 70th birthday with a mini-reunion in Vegas, and SLS was generous enough to offer us a very discounted rate for an additional night (weeknight).  Way to go we thought, even though we're die-hard MLife fans, if this is their customer service, we can work with that - we're in Vegas often enough anyway.

Fast forward to checkout day - we grab our bags, head to the front desk and ask for a copy of our bill.  Bill in tow, we head over to the Code Desk - surprise, they don't comp stays, but do comp food.  The lady helping us out then told us that although we played a lot, they'd only be able to comp the pizza - the only thing we charged to the room.  A call later, and we were done - her words!  No need to go back to the front desk - you'll be automatically checked out.  And then off we went.

A few days pass by, no charges.  Strange - why the delay?  The weekend rolls around and surprise again!  A charge that doesn't make sense appears.  One more surprise when we call - no one can help you - casino marketing isn't open on the weekend (really?!).  Today rolls around and another surprise - we're on hold for the most of twenty-some minutes, being passed around and wait for it - ANOTHER SURPRISE - we can't refund the incorrect amount because we have to open an investigation because we weren't checked out - we were in the room past three in the afternoon so they assumed that we were staying.  

Wait, what?!  We took the housekeeping sign OFF our door when we checked out - we saw the housekeeping a few rooms down and made our way out.  What on earth is this ridiculousness?!  We can't get anyone on the phone, everyone sounds like they're talking down to us.

I can't believe this whole experience - while SLS was not the best or the fanciest place I've ever stayed at, it certainly wasn't the worst, and we had an overall decent time.  Until we got home.  And got charged.  And are now being treated like liars and cheats.",4,2,1

I had read a lot of mixed reviews on Yelp and other websites. However, the only opened last fall, so I thought I would give it a chance. The hotel was great! I stayed at the NYNY my first two nights because I had comped rooms due to rewards there. After staying at the SLS, I wish my entire stay would have been spent there. 

The rooms are clean, modern, hip, and fun. They are spacious. I don't know what people are talking about. I have stayed at other hotels on the Vegas strip with much smaller rooms. Unless you are trying to stay somewhere like the Palazzo, The Venetian, The Encore, The Cosmo, etc.. then there is no room to complain. These rooms were fantastic. 

The service was great. There were people who welcomed me at the front door and at the elevators. The front desk was great and gave me complimentary late check out because I had a later flight. I also always feel more secure in hotels that have people monitoring the elevators. You also have to scan your card to get the elevator to come, which is nice.

The casino, food, pool, and nightlife at the SLS were all great. You could get away with spending a significant amount of time at the SLS because the hotel itself has so much to offer, even though it may not be one of the mega hotels that you would find other places on the strip. 

The only two things that are inconvenient are the location and the wifi. However, lets be honest. It is still on the strip, and getting around in Vegas via the Deuce (bus) or a cab is super easy. The wifi was a little bit weak and it was hard for me to access the internet. However, the hotel still printed my boarding pass for free for me. And internet seems like such a small need if you are hanging out in Vegas. 

Some people mentioned this was not a good hotel if you are away on business. I would disagree. While I was traveling for fun, I travel for business often, and Vegas is one of the places that I end up frequently. I would love to stay here. It is comfortable and relaxed. The rooms are great. The desk space is awesome. The only complaint would be internet. I would assume the hotel would be working that out as it seems to be a common concern. 

Overall, the SLS is great. If you have been reading reviews and have been deterred away from SLS, don't be. Try it. I promise you won't be disappointed. I usually have high standards and the SLS met them. I signed up for their rewards program and got my Friday night hotel on Valentines weekend for like $65.

PLEASE NOTE, this is NOT the SLS in LA so don't go in expecting that. The room was exactly as shown in the website photos minus the mood lighting. The casino is kinda smokey considering this is a newly opened hotel. The ground outside and in some of the elevators could be repaved and signs of The Sahara can still be found in some spots. I had a very quiet room, the beds are SUPER comfy but appear small. I don't remember if the website lists them as a full or queen, but they felt like fulls. The room was very cute and accommodated my family well. Plenty of space for our things. The bathroom was very trendy but the toilet is far from the tissue (LOL). 

The parking garage and signage is a bit confusing so once you're checked in, definitely ask the front desk the best garage for your tower. Check -in was quick and easy and the front desk agent was VERY friendly and explained everything well. 

LOVED all the restaurants on site, something for everyone and the pool seemed to have a good crowd all day. I wish we would have had more time to check the pool out. The doormen have really cheesy plaid jackets and didn't even look like they worked for the hotel, most of them were  too busy talking about their days off or holiday plans to give directions or assistance. 

Great place for the price, I hope it doesn't attract the wrong crowds, location isn't in the best of the strip, but manageable.

Several young ladies were wearing shorts as short as panties with 6 inch heels but you could tell everyone was trying to get laid that night.  It's funny to suddenly feel your age when you see the young people. 
     While we people-watched, we sat at a Mega Bucks slot machine and won $115 or so but we were having so much fun , we gambled most of that back into it.  
     Our room in the Story Tower knocked our socks off.  Never had we stayed in such a unique setting, with grey and bright yellow urban-modern decor and a crazy layout that tickled us to death.  A mirror over our bed, the bed in the MIDDLE of the room instead of against the wall, 2 sliding mirrored doors for the toilet room and beautifully tiled shower respectively, a mini bar that included condoms, lube, and a vibrator (what a trip haha!), a full sized sofa, iron, blowdryer, big tv, safe, makeup mirror, and nice big towels.  There was no coffee maker BUT The Perq (coffee place) was a simple trip down the elevator and back in the room in 5 minutes.  The Story Tower has no ice machine, which I understand would take away from the cool factor, so we had to call for room service to bring a complimentary giant bucket of ice.  Not too shabby.  The lighting in the room is customizable to your mood.  We turned all the lights off to go to bed at 3am and found out you can turn a knob on the white plastic headboard and THAT lights up on a dimmer switch.  I love finding Easter Eggs like that.
     You have to get lost a bit to find the best way from Self-Parking to your room, we found out.  They don't have enough information signs to help you with that.  
     The place is clean, unique, dynamic, and fun.  We would stay here again!",0,0,0

At 5 there were a lot of people still there from the opening, maybe coming from one of the clubs?  Because I am an old fogey, my first thought was ""tragically hip"".This is a place that definitely was not set up for my generation.  And I think that is a good thing.  It is a smaller casino and once things shake out, I think it could get a following of the 20 - 30ish crowd. The casino is on the small side, but it does create a nice intimate experience.  The food venues are off the casino floor and sound like they have interesting items, but come prepared to pay. They aren't to proud to charge you that arm and leg.

Check-In Experience:
After checking in, my husband and I went to find our room. As the elevator opened, our first reaction was sniff and cringe. The hallways and doors were all black - and dirty, and the entire floor smelled like an intense potpourri of stale cigarettes, carpet glue and weed. After searching the room for the ultimate clue that would tip us off to the fact that we'd been placed on a smoking floor, we found it. There it was - the ashtray - next to the beautiful colored drinking glasses sitting on 2 strands of long dark hair. 

20 minutes after making a call to the front desk to change rooms, no new room keys had arrived. So, we hauled our suitcases back downstairs to get some new keys to our new non-smoking room. When I confronted the front desk (same guy that provided us the first set of keys), he asked if I had called earlier for an early checkin. My answer was no. Then he proceeded to spin a story as to why he gave me a smoking room while saying it was non smoking. He said that that was all he had available at the time (I highly doubt this - it was a Monday). So, after no apology or ownership, he gave us our new keys and we are hauling our luggage back up to our new floor. 

The second we walk out the elevator - a woman blew a huge cloud of cigarette smoke in our faces. The trash can with giant ash tray on top was filled with cigarette butts, so obviously, this is the place to go people to get your fix... The non-smoking floor with no windows. Great. 

We get into room #2, and begin to unload our computers. After removing a couple more dark long hairs from the white sofa and white bed pillow, I decide to focus on work. I was there on business for a convention. Needed to write a speech. Both my husband and I could not get on the WiFi. We called downstairs and they sent up an IT technician. Result: You need to change rooms \/ move to the other side of the tower to get closer to the router. No one gets reception over on this side. 

So we call to get new room keys again. This time they are brought up to the room. We were upgraded to a room with a view for our inconveniences, which was nice. As we enter the room, same long dark hairs on the furniture. I mean, this is room #3. Maybe the all- white furniture makes dark hair strands stand out, but honestly, if you are ambitious enough to design a white hotel room in Vegas, make sure it's immaculate. Power went out in the bathroom the next morning, which sucked.

The Room: The beautiful wall graphics pictured on the website are actually printed on canvas tapestries hanging from hooks at the top of each wall. Unique, yes. But, I begin to wonder how clean these giant tapestries are, as I am sure they are not swapped out frequently. The desk, nightstand and large sofa seemed well made. The chandelier seemed cheap. The bed was comfortable. 

Monkey Bar: Great style and drinks. Wished it was away from the front desk. Looking at annoyed people standing in line in their travel clothes kinda takes away from the swank and corkiness of the bar.

The Shops:
Super cute and friendly staff

Katsuya: Food was great. Much better value than Katsuya in Laguna Beach (now closed).",1,0,0

Our ceremony was held in the Sayers Club, an intimate live music venue which needed virtually no additional decor. The lighting in the venue was warm and romantic, and our guests were able to watch the ceremony from plush leather couches. So cool!
 
Our reception was catered by one of our favorite restaurants, Bazaar Meat. Next to the restaurant is a small private casino area that can be booked for private events. We had a dance floor and fake-money gambling (blackjack and craps) for our guests during the reception. Several of the SLS's most personable dealers ensured our guests had an absolute blast. The SLS-provided chairs, tables, and linens fit in perfectly with the modern aesthetic we wanted for our wedding.
 
The food and drink was out of this world. We had Bazaar Meat craft a custom menu for our guests featuring our favorite dishes - Jamón Iberico, cotton candy foie gras, and suckling pig. The wait staff was incredibly attentive to us and all of our guests, and kept the wine and craft cocktails flowing. The bar staff was exceptionally accommodating, creating non-alcoholic mocktails for our non-drinking friends and family.

He actually won from an instagram contest from @institution18b which affiliated with Foxtail SLS. The only problem is, he left his tickets in a community retail shop that closed before he was even notified that the owners weren't going to come back. That's not even the situation yet. We then drove to SLS casino to speak with management. The farthest we've gone was security management. SLS security management was probably the worst securities that I've ever encountered with. We came there to speak with SLS management about the situation. SLS security literally told us to go on our phones and contact them. No way on earth they wanted to give us any information about SLS management. They kept bringing up that my friend isn't 21 and there is no way for him to get into the concert. Yes we understand that. We didn't come there to try to go into the concert. We came there to speak to SLS management about the situation. Like I said before, my friend won the tickets from @institutionb18b, but no where on their caption says that you have to be 21+. It's Foxtail SLS'S responsibility to communicate that information to @institution18b. Which was the reason why we wanted to speak to SLS management.

Ever since SLS was going to have a property in Las Vegas I could not wait to go. I haven't read any review before I planned my trip for this weekend and to get a full experience I wanted to try as much as SLS had to offer the food the room the casino and the night life. SLS website for about SLS says ""Taking service and luxury standards from traditional 5-star hotels and injecting elements of creativity and community, SLS delivers a guest experience that seamlessly delivers service, style and fun."" that does not apply for this hotel.

First I love going to Vegas, usually I like to stay at The Signature, Vdara, Trump, Wynn and the Venetian. I did not expect SLS to meet those standards but at least have decent services. So let's start with guest services. Front desk person was not bad but when you call to request anything or ask any questions their so quick to answer and try to end your conversation quickly as possible you won't even get a ""is there anything else I can assist you with"". I called for a later check out and guest services says ""ok"" then hangs up. A category four Marriott will treat you better than this.

Second the room. I stayed on the second floor of the world tower. The room being small I really didn't care, most of my time in is hardly spent in the room anyways. But the design of the room was terrible. There's only one sink and it is not even in the bathroom. When you want to get to the bathroom you have to slide the door open and it ends up covering the sink. The choice of colors for interior was very poor. The sliding door for the bathroom doesn't even have a lock. If you were to imagine you were in a prison and looking out your window that's how it feels looking out the window of your room. The cups that are in the room had water streaks on it. The tiles in the bathroom was uneven. Lastly what they never mention on the website or at check in was that there is no room service to the world tower. Why is there a room service button on your phone? The excuse for not having room service to the world tower is laughable. ""When this hotel was built they didn't build it in a way so the world tower can receive room service."" Well then, when SLS spent their 415 million dollar renovation why did they not take this into consideration. If they weren't going to, why not just hire someone to be able to take food to rooms of the world tower?

Third the food. Almost all SLS Las Vegas hotel restaurants are available in Los Angeles. I decided to try Ku Noodle. I'll write a separate review on that but just to give a brief summary. I'm a huge fan of José Andrés. His food is amazing. This is not. It wasn't the service that was bad. It was the food. Just terrible.

Now the casino. I played craps here and the dealers there were fine some of them looked like they were having trouble doing the math but hey that's fine. I've only seen downtown dealers struggle but I guess it's ok for a hotel that has only been open for about two months now. The roulette dealers were terrible. I played at three different roulette tables. All three dealers just looked mad, annoyed, tired, and just not a fun person you want to play with. They just have such an attitude to make you want to walk away to another table. Sorry SLS but because of that I actually left your hotel to go play elsewhere because the vibe your dealers give is not a good nor a friendly one. Downtown Las Vegas has better roulette dealers than here.
Last the night life, Life, nice new club this is the one place I will not complain about. It's pretty spacious coloring and layout design was nice. To me it kind of felt like something similar to Light night club at the Mandalay Bay, but it has its own little unique features.

Ultimately, I went to Las Vegas this weekend to check out the new in town SLS and to see if this was going to be a place I would want to go to because they bring a vibe that other hotels can't. It's not. I was extremely dissatisfied with SLS Las Vegas. The disappointment is real. I know after experiencing SLS that my money is better elsewhere.",1,0,0

I would not take any review that is negative simply because this is not a kid friendly hotel with an OUNCE of seriousness. Yes, there is a pool that is for adults only, it's SIN CITY! There is also a family pool at this hotel. Gambling, also for adults! Again, it's SIN CITY. Yes the room has a fully stocked mini bar because it's SIN CITY! Honestly of all of the places to vacation at in the United States, I would not ever take my kids with me to Vegas. I personally feel that Vegas is an adult experience. If you wanna bring your kids with you, this might not be the hotel for you. With all things, do your research before you book. Don't leave a negative review on yelp because YOU didn't do YOUR due diligence! I digress. Now, on to the review!

We got an AMAZING deal through vegas.com. It was $600 for 6 days, 5 nights and that included airfare from the Commonwealth state of Virginia. Too good to pass up. Ubered it from the airport to the hotel and it was about $7. Uber will be your best friend while you are here because this hotel is at the end of the strip.

Upon arrival, the young lady checking us in, Savannah was SO FRIENDLY. I nicely asked if we could be upgraded and baby we were! There are three different towers here and we were in the Lux Tower. The hotel reminds me a boutique hotel in terms of décor and feel. It was luxurious, but not like The Four Seasons, which is classically luxurious. This hotel has a small casino, but I don't gamble so it didn't matter to me. I will say that if you are a die hard gambler, you probably won't like it. 

Imma talk about the pool for a second. There are 3 pools, but I only saw two; the main level near the casino and the rooftop. It's July in Vegas and it's HOTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!! We went to the pool around 11. It opens at 10:30. If you want a couch or a chaise water lounge, you need to have your ass down there at 10:20!!!!!! Hell, 10 sharp! I CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH! There was NOWHERE to sit until we asked an older gentlemen who was by himself if we could sit on the sofa with him. People are allowed to reserve cabanas the night before and all of them were reserved.The sun had me in a vice grip and I was UNDER the umbrella. It was SO HOT out there that my phone said that the internal temperature had reached over 110 degrees and it would be turning off. And it did, so no cute pool selfies for me :( The DJ came out at about noon, right when we were going back inside. I love laying out at the pool when I'm home because it's never 120 degrees but I just can't do it in Vegas! 

Let's see. We were on the 22nd floor. The hallways are dimly lit, adding to the overall ambiance of the hotel. Our room was amazing. SLS monogrammed crisp white duvet covers on the bed, firm yet fluffy pillows also monogrammed with SLS. The bed felt SO good. We had a long white sofa in our room which was a throwback to the Josephine Baker era, two full length mirrors with desks and chairs in front of them and an intricate closet storage area that leads to the bathroom. Chandelier. Huge flat screen on the wall. Floor to ceiling picture window. Beautifully designed fabric that serves as wall paper. There is no actual 'closet' with a door. Across from the closet area is a separate toilet with a mirrored sliding glass door. Further into the actual bathroom are two double sinks, marbled counter. These sinks are fancy, but they needed to be about a good six inches deeper to be fully functional. You could barely get your hands under the faucet to wash them! Under the sinks are glass shelves. Across from the sink is a huge walk in shower with dual shower heads; one above your head and one on the wall that give an amazingggggggggg shower experience. I've never taken so many showers in all of my life! The shower has a full length window in it that looks into the bedroom area, so if you're not with your boo thang, you'll want to draw the curtain, unless you like giving a show. I think it would be totally hot to watch the object of your affection in there! I gotta get a boyfriend soon! There is also a mini bar that is FULLY STOCKED. And I do mean fully! There are also pretty pricey snacks above the mini bar and a kit for 'lovers' (oil, condoms, toys) 

All in all, I am a HOTEL SNOB and I REALLYYYYYY enjoyed this hotel. Everyone was so friendly and helpful from the front desk to the valet staff, doormen, bouncers, wait staff, housekeeping, bartenders, cocktail waitresses, everyone had a smile on their face!

Can you imagine our shock and terror when a maid appeared over our beds unannounced at midnight with a pile of towels that we DID NOT order? Followed by a call to the manager at the front desk who did not believe me or apologize when I recounted the story. All this happening while the entire room (on the 17th floor) shook with the concert happening outside at the pool club. Not a single poster or ad for this concert indicated it was happening at night (until 1am). As the pool hours are listed from 10:30am until 6pm, imagine the surprise we had to here the bass thumping at 10:15pm when we got back to our room. Besides the noise, between the time we left our room in the morning and when we arrived that evening, tiles in the bathroom were mysteriously broken and the beds unmade. Is the Sahara ghost now haunting the SLS? Perhaps a ghost would have been more polite than any staff member at the front desk. From rude to hostile to argumentative it seems that the staff were trained in prison rather than hospitality school. Not to mention the bouncer stationed on the foxtail pool deck monitoring the 16 chairs not requiring a $350 reservation charge, with his hand out waiting for tips to permit you to grab a chair when someone got up.

The night I arrived (late check in!) I couldn't connect to net - work went undone.  I called down to have it sorted out and was told by the concierge that the hotel had been having internet problems but all should be sorted in the morning. I got up extra early the next day but there was still no connection. Before leaving for the Leadership Seminar (work) I was in town for  I stopped at the Front Desk. The employee was really nice as he tried to connect my lap top to the hotel's network but all we were able to do was confirm that the issue was hotel's and not my computer skills. On my last night the connection was fixed, unfortunately I didn't have time to access it and my work went undone.

I loved the hotel's beauty product line but would have preferred a shampoo instead of 2 body lotions and a toothbrush instead of 2 sewing kits. And I was also disappointed that there was no coffee maker in the room - it made my 5:30 AM conference call very painful lol! I don't think having a shot of alcohol from the mini-bar would have made me any more coherent and there was really no time to order from room service - exited at 6:45 AM....

The room was clean, the bed made well but the day I checked out I found someone else's black sock under the suitcase bench! My bag had been parked there since the day I arrived. Perhaps it escaped from another room???? 

Above aside most of the staff was cordial and as accommodating as they could be, especially the guards manning the elevator, the business center service person (6:45AM!) and lobby store attendant.  The hotel may want to remind the doormen that it's usually more respectful to take a female's bag before he takes the male's -when he realized his mistake he ignored it!  I just dumped my bags in the open trunk as he loaded my work companion's in!

However, for anyone else who is planning to stay here, don't let all of the bad reviews scare you away. I stayed here for two nights and had a fantastic time.

The part I feared about the most were all of the reviews saying the parking elevators didn't work. Well, luckily for us, they were definitely functioning when we were there.

We arrived around 9pm to check-in and didn't have to wait in a line at all. Our room was very clean and to be honest, I really like the design and layout of the entire hotel. Yeah, it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I personally thought it was pretty refreshing and trendy.

The hotel has a ton of great restaurants to choose from, so even though it's a bit far away from the rest of the strip, we barely left the hotel at all. You WILL need to make reservations for your restaurant of choice. Bazaar Meats was completely booked the day we wanted to eat there and we were told that it had been booked for the entire week :(

The concierge is extremely helpful and friendly.

We really liked the cafe during the morning since they serve pretty freaking good coffee.

The only minor problem we had was that when we checked in, the person helping us only had our keys set to work for one day instead of two. So on the second day, we had to go back to the front desk to get it working again, but since we were in the World Tower, it wasn't too much of a hassle.

If you gamble, you should know that they seem to train a lot of the new dealers during the daytime (at least in my experience), so the game may move slower than what you're used to. It was an alright pace for me since I did more observing than gambling. Everyone was really friendly and inviting, though :)

I do think that this hotel is kind of geared towards the LA crowd because of the vibe it gives off and the restaurants and shops that inhabit it (Umami Burger, Fred Segal), but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

I definitely enjoyed my stay here and would definitely stay here again.

TL;DR - Think of this as the ""boutique"" hotel of the Las Vegas strip. It's small and trendy.",18,4,7

I get to the hotel for check in and I'm told I have to settle for one king bed to split between four adults.

Whatever it's Vegas we'll barely be in the room right? I have a king size bed at home, I get to my room and the bed is maybe a queen, I call downstairs I'm given more attitude, but the offer to change my room Sunday after people have checked out and rooms become available, since they're all sold out on the Friday I arrived. Sunday comes I'm called to go downstairs to pick up new room keys with my new room number and told to go to the ""invited guests"" line. Not sure where it is, I ask a staff member and I'm told just walk over there and you'll find it. Thanks that's helpful! So I walk don't see it, ask someone else they walk me over. And so I'm standing in line to be ignored by staff and have other hotel guests rolling their eyes at me for being in a different line. I stand in line about 20 mins for me to find out they'd delivered new keys to my current room. Thanks for wasting my time! So I attempt to go back up and the guy that told me to go that way is telling me I cannot go upstairs because I don't have my room key. Um what? We had a conversation when I got off the elevator! We go out the day and night. Get back to the hotel we can't find out room keys, I go over to the front desk with my drivers license, and card that I used to book the room and I let them know I've misplaced my room key. I'm told ""I'll see what I can do"" wanting to immediately go off, I inhale and just say thank you. Seriously? You'll see what you can do when I was so polite and had all my stuff ready? He walks away and comes back with a new key and my license and slams them onto the desk\/ table thing. Is anybody trained around here? Or having any type of manners?

Instead of answering my questions in a kind and respectful manner, I feel like my questions were met with a scoff and brief answer to get me to leave. 

I went up to my room which was surprisingly small for a suite, and in my opinion, the decor was a bit tacky. The bathroom and shower were in separate closets which was a bit awkward. 

Next I went down to the pool which was loud, dirty and anticlimactic. I tried to wave down someone to take my order for about 15 minutes until I finally decided to order at the bar. At the bar, the bartender took his time looking through his receipts and talking to his coworkers before getting to me. When I finally was able to order, I asked if I could put my bill on my room and was rudely informed that they would need to see my room card and ID. I was totally fine showing it but the manner in which he asked was pretty aggressive and rude considering the reputation of the hotel and cost of these overpriced drinks. You would think the service matches the price point but clearly not here. 

Next, I went to Katsuya for social hour which was the best service and quality of food\/drinks I've had here. They were kind, courteous and helpful. When asking to see my ID or room card, they did it in a kind and thoughtful way, as to not make you feel like you were a nuisance or trying to do something wrong. 

Next, I went back to my hotel room and called the concierge asking for an extra blanket. It's been over an hour and a half and still no blanket. 

I'm am truly shocked by how awful the service is at this hotel. I've been to the SLS in Beverly Hills many times which is completely different in the way they treat their patrons. Going there, you actually feel respected and pampered whereas here you will probably get better service at circus circus or the Luxor. I'm not sure if the employees hate working here or if they just think they're better than most of their guests.

When we got to our room we were sort of a bigger room with extra space only to find that it seemed like a normal room with two queen beds. One thing I didn't like was how the beds were immediately visible when we opened the door. One thing I did love was the huge mirrors in the room with the amazing lighting (makeup guru and selfie-lovers dream). 

The beds were quite comfy and a good size for two people. The bathroom did not have an actual lock on the sliding door, unless we didn't see it.

To start off: they were advertising the rooms for $70 online. You go on, you buy it, then you get to the hotel and pay $90 total. Then when you check out, you pay a resort fee of $30. SO...after all of that, you pay close to  $130 a night. That's not horrible for the strip, but it's a bit of a scam. Also, they tried to charge us for chips that we didn't eat or move. If you are not going to eat the food, don't even touch it. They have sensors. I was ready to bring her up the room to prove that we didn't eat the chips. 

The rooms are very small, which we were not a fan of. Also, the air conditioner had a huge bang when we were sleeping and the vent cover fell on the floor. So, no air or heat for that night. This is a very new hotel. I know things happen, but it was pretty surprising. And we also saw how filthy the air unit was. Poopy. 


All in all, I wasn't very happy with the experience. The only thing that made me happy was 800 Degrees Pizza and Umami.
We were only there for Rock and Rio. We live in Vegas and we stay on the strip if we're going to be out late. Rock and Rio was running super late so it was nice. But, SLS took FULL ADVANTAGE of people and charged $40 for parking. I'm sorry, we paid $1200 for tickets for Rock and Rio and they were really killing people on that. I've heard they're not doing so well, so please...overcharge for parking for people who already paid a fortune for tickets. That's nuts.",13,4,3

The SLS barely qualifies as being on the Strip- it is super far from all the other hotels, and not walking distance to anywhere. It's actually closer to Downtown Vegas, which is less than a mile away. Also, the rooms there are very small, and if you get two beds, they will be doubles instead of queens. 

When we checked in, the front desk person was incredibly rude, and they couldn't even find my reservation through Hotwire. After waiting for 15 minutes, they had to charge my credit card for the night, and refund me the next day after they called Hotwire to sort out the issue. The room was too modern for my tastes- the curtain shade had a crowd of people screened on it, which was really creepy. There also isn't a fan in the bathroom. The one plus for the ladies is that they have two giant floor length mirrors with inset lighting- perfect for getting ready. However, that is where the positives end- the AC in our first room broke so we had to change rooms the next day. After waiting on hold for 10 minutes to speak with someone in their Front Desk department, they told me my credit card wasn't swiped correctly the day before, so I had to go downstairs and give it to them again, which was really annoying. I finally complained to a manager and they said they would comp our resort fee for our troubles- but of course I got charged and now have to dispute them. The other annoying thing is that they don't have separate elevator banks, so if you have a higher floor, you have to wait to drop off 3-5 people on the way up to your room. Their casino and sports book area are small, and their club (LiFe) is mediocre. Needless to say, I will NOT be staying at the SLS again!",6,0,0

The pit crew at SLS has watched one too many casino heist movies and it's gone to their tiny heads.  These delusional freaks treat anyone who isn't completely shitfaced like a potential thief or cheat. Sit down at a table and start betting Real Money and watch them scurry into action.  They'll stare you down, ask intimidating and personal questions, and generally make you feel uncomfortable.

What's Real Money you ask?  At the SLS, Real Money is a measly $25. I'm not kidding, these guys freak out over anyone betting $25 or more.  And what's with the freaking out, anyway?  You're a casino.  Aren't you supposed to court your higher bettors?  Give them free meals and rooms and all that?

Here's a suggestion, SLS: Lighten Up.  If you fancy yourself a High-End Las Vegas Strip Resort, but you freak out over a $50 bet, you're not a High-End Las Vegas Strip Resort.  In fact, you're not even a smoke stained downtown operation.  You're a sawdust joint that belongs in Wells or Tonopah or some other remote shithole.

When comparing SLS to other hotels, this place is awesome!! It's off the strip, but right off the mono rail which is an affordable train that takes you to different parts of the strip and back to the SLS' front doors! 

The room was easy to book and fairly cheap. Check in was easy and quick, the attendant helped us figure out our plans for the night and how to get the most out of our room. We needed an additional mini fridge for medicine, someone brought it to us free of charge. Always had fresh towels and linens. 

There's lots of food options, but just like most things Vegas, pretty expensive.

Two pools, one by the casino with a bar and servers. Attentive. Decent drinks. Another on the roof, exclusive to hotel guests and only open on weekends. Probably the most relaxing morning I've had in a while.


Only weird thing was there was only one ice machine on our floor, and it was really far from our room. It didn't bother me, but the people I stayed with were really bothered by it.",0,0,0

The décor messed with our emotions.  We wanted to love it and could see the potential in it, but it just looked like an upscale dorm room, and we don't care if Philippe Starck himself designed it (although I am a huge fan of his ghost chair!).  The tacky pull down shade with the faces on it added to that feel. There were major design flaws in the bathroom that perplexed us, the worst being that the toilet paper holder was about an arm's length away...if you're bending over sideways. The other was that the tile selected for the bathroom made it seem like the hotel had run low on their budget.  It didn't help that all the grout lines between the tiles on the shower floor probably made it hard for the maids to clean, as there was mildew buildup on the corners.  For a hotel that is fairly new, this shouldn't have happened.

When I booked the hotel through Expedia, it said that the hotel was located on the strip, even though it's actually not.  It's about ten minutes away.  There are other hotels that are similar in price that are actually on the strip. 

My friend was told by a Lyft driver on her way over that he had heard negative things from his other customers, like the fact that the maids do not care if there is a ""do not disturb"" sign hanging on the doorknob and will knock anyway.  We figured that couldn't possibly be true... until it happened to us bright and early in the morning when we were hungover and still trying to sleep in a bit.  When we are hungover, and you are knocking on our door at 9 AM, it is not pretty. 

The sensors on the mini bar are VERY sensitive, which another Yelper had mentioned, so I yelled at my friend the minute she touched something on the mini bar.  Once I checked out, I found out I had been charged for some $20 item from the mini bar, although the front desk was really nice about it and said they would remove the charge. (Can't say for sure it happened, because I haven't checked my credit card bill yet.)

Don't even ask to check out a bit late.  There are other hotels that will be happy to accommodate this request, but not this one. 

Now for the little bit of good...

If you are wanting a hotel that has good lighting for makeup, this might be the hotel for you.  Probably the only redeeming quality about this hotel that sets it apart from the rest is that they have as close to ""daylight"" colored lighting as you can get, whereas most hotels will have a warmer yellow ambient lighting that's not good for makeup application.  They also have lots of mirrors, including these great floor length ones that illuminate on all sides at the touch of a button.  So, if all you care about while staying in Vegas is making sure that you don't walk around looking like a clown if you decide to do a dramatic makeup look, then you'll have a lovely time here!",5,4,2

Also, it is on the Monorail line.  Also, right out front of the hotel, (Paradise side) is a bus stop.  The SDX is the express and goes to the strip (downtown aka Fremont Street, on the opposite side).  The 108 goes to the airport (straight shot...$2 whuuuut?).  

Across the street, you have McDonald's (if you're into that sort of thing), India Oven, Thai Pepper, a 24 hour Subway, a 7-11, a Walgreens, a Starbucks, even a boxing gym, a massage parlor and a multitude of other conveniences...which thanks to not being 'on the strip', guess what?  You don't have to pay strip prices! 

I just thought I'd give a local's perspective.  I have done several staycations there when it was the Sahara, and did my first (since the switchover)  a few days ago.  The rooms were comfy, the staff was awesome.  There was\/is a strike going on, and the front desk was kind enough to move our room so we could get at least one nights sleep.   

The pillows and bath sheets are beyond amazing.  If you forget your shampoo, don't worry, they actually have decent shampoo and conditioner.

After reading the reviews I took a chance since I really wanted to be able to just cross the street after the show Saturday night. I'm glad I did!

I pulled into self parking and was greeted right away with ""Are you here for the ACM show?"" I said yes but I'm also staying in the hotel, do you want to see my paperwork? Because duh. Why wouldn't they want to know for sure that I was staying? They don't want ACM people parking for free in their lot! Showed him the paperwork was let in with no problems. Went to the front desk to see about an early check in since we got there around 11 or so. I was helped by a really nice younger guy who chatted, asked if I was there for the show, talked about having 2 kids. He said it was $20 for early check in which I wasn't told when I inquired about it online, but I was ok with that if we could get into our room early. He went to check with housekeeping and came back and asked if I was an SPG rewards member. I told him I wasn't. He explained that it's free and that I could be upgraded to a nicer room in the World Tower instead of the Story Tower at no extra charge. I signed up got my room key and went back to the car to get my stuff. The room was different, but it was nice. I will say I thought it was pretty pricey for what we got. We had absolutely no issues during the stay and everyone was nice and professional. Won a little but on the Willy Wonka machine which is always my favorite. The only issue I had the entire time was the charge on my folio for an $8 box of MnMs from the mini bar that I didn't eat. I don't even eat candy and certainly not at $8 a box lol. I emailed them, they took it off right away and that was that.

I would absolutely stay here again, but honestly not if I had to pay $300 night. I went online the day of and found rooms for less which kind of pissed me off.

Bottom line- the staff has clearly has not had adequate training and time to be able to operate this hotel yet. 

Arrival: It was not clear which entrance was for check-in and which was the side more for clubs.

Check in: Rate did not match what i had reserved and what was on my confirmation. So an already slow process took longer since a manager had to sort that out. I had booked directly on the SLS website as well. Meanwhile - during all this wait, the bellman is stuck standing there with our stuff on a cart as he goes up with us at the same time.

Valet: Awful. Waiting area small and dangerous. The female attendant who ""helped"" me after we had been waiting 30 minutes for our car should not be in any type of position that deals with customers. Rude, snide and unhelpful, even when we were about to miss our show. We were beyond patient.

Self-parking: after the Valet debacle, we chose to self-park (Valet was always full after that anyways- no choice.) Many people driving the wrong way because it's not marked and as many have said, some elevators didn't work, but weren't marked as such.

Perq: 10 people working, but clearly struggling on how to make the  coffee drinks. Everyone waiting a good 15 minutes for their beverages, when there was virtually no line.

Griddle Cafe: Had nice service with Alexis. Food was ok. This was at 12:00am though. Wait was ridiculous otherwise and they wouldn't take reservations for breakfast.

Mini-bar: not fully stocked, no price menu.

Room: small but nice. However, mini blinds and a pull down shade that doesn't fully block out light? In Vegas? Really? Gave it a motel feel. We had to try to stick towels around the window so we didn't get an early morning sunshine wake-up call that we didn't want.  And the pull down shade was so weird with a group of people on it? Supposed to be cool I guess but really was quite creepy.

Check-out: I couldn't check out on the TV screen because my charges were wrong again and no one answered the phone, so I had to wait in line and it took the front desk staff about 10-15 minutes for EACH person in line.

Hopefully they can get it together......hotels kinda get one chance with customers to get it right. Plenty of other choices in this price range so it's not like I'm going to ""try"" them again.",6,2,1

In my previous Vegas adventures, I have stayed in The Cosmopolitan a couple times, Vdara, Bellagio, MGM and New York New York--the big grandeur well-known Vegas experience. I am also frequently in LA so I have checked out most of the spots in LA that are in the SLS and love them. I was anxious to see what all the hate was about.

I realized that perhaps these people were a bit too quick to judge. I see the efforts in making this a praiseworthy hotel, but of course there are it's pros and cons...

1) The decor and ambiance of the hotel was very eclectic, eccentric, chic, artsy and laid-back. You can tell it was a reno, but it's pretty good. I found it rather refreshing as opposed to the other more opulent hotels on the Strip. The art pieces reminded me a lot of the LACMA in LA.

2) The hotel IS on the small side...but so what?! It's a boutique hotel after all. The casino is also very small, but this was the intention of SBE. The hotels focus is mainly on entertainment and dining. 

We stayed in a World King Room on a high floor.  It is indeed smaller than other Vegas hotel rooms, but we both thought it was spacious for two. It was simple and crisp; very SLS style, but I would say on the more inexpensive, less luxurious and contemporary side. The bed and sheets were incredibly comfy; and I am happy to say that our TV was working fine. . The hotel and rooms were VERY CLEAN and I could smell their signature scent throughout--no stale smoke or cigs smell. 

3) The service we received was attentive and welcoming. We were greeted by all the employees that we walked by. Check-in was very quick, perhaps we arrived a more quieter time (around 6:30-7pm). 

We asked for recommendations on clubs and lounges to go to on a Thursday night. Leo, the Assistant Manager of the hotel helped us out. Unfortunately, he gave us some wrong info. He was unaware that LIFE was not open on Thursdays (although he mentioned it was ""LIFE night"") and that Foxtail was closed for renovations. Nevertheless, although he should know these details very well as the Assistant Manager...I did not let that ruin my night. Also, he was very friendly and pleasant to chat with. 

Taxi service is easier to hitch at the front entrance. The line up and wait is long at the back but if you go to the front, you get a cab right away and there's usually a line-up of cabs waiting there.

4) The POOL is great! Very chic and relaxing. There were way too many empty daybeds and lounge chairs that they expected patrons to pay for, but in reality it seemed that not many people wanted to pay $300\/2 people. I saw quite a few people walking around looking for chairs and finally some life guards pulling chairs out of the empty cabana areas for them. The host did offer us the daybeds for $150 after, so they do give you options and are nice about it. 

However, I felt service was poor.  I hunted a server down for a menu and she NEVER came back. I wanted a drink direly, but figured I didn't want to pay for such service. They seemed attentive to the daybed, lilypad and cabana guests though.

5) Now for the dining and entertainment, saved the best for last. We tried Umami, The Griddle, 800 Degrees, The Perq, LIFE and Sayers Club. We did our fancy dining elsewhere. I have to say, Umami and The Griddle are better in LA. Pizza at 800 Degrees was delicious! --and they mixed up the orders BADLY.  I LOVED THE PERQ's coffee and TRUFFLE SCONES. I love TRUFFLES and if you do, go get their scone!!

Thursday night, we went to the Sayers Club. No line, no cover. It wasn't busy but had a good amount of people. The music was hip hop mostly and the patio outside is a great place to sit, listen to music and sip your drinks. To get into clubs quick and easy, you need to talk to the Concierge. The girl connected us with Steven, the SLS VIP Services Host, who got us into LIFE for Eric Prydz on Saturday night with no line, no cover. You must tell the host you're a hotel guest or else he could care less about you. LIFE is a good club with a nice layout but was not full. 

Another plus is that the girl at the Concierge got us connected with a VIP host for Hyde (owned by SBE) at the Bellagio too. Within 5 minutes, the VIP host, James, for Hyde got us on the list. No line, no cover and open bar till 12 AM.

Overall, the hotel and crowd is very LA. Even IF there were ""hookers"" around, who cares. It was a different Vegas than any I've experienced. Since it's fairly off-strip, I liked that it was quieter and more relaxing. It's far but the monorail and cabbing is convenient. If you want something different from the generic Vegas experience, I would recommend staying here. I will also be back!",3,1,3

I just returned from a midweek stay. I reserved at World Tower King for $130\/ night with a $150 spa voucher available on their website. $130 may seem inexpensive, but this was a Wed & Thur night. I am sure it is considerable more on the weekends. At check in we asked if an upgrade was available as we had heard the Luxe Tower rooms were very nice. We were informed that they were at full capacity due to conventions. That turned out to be very true. The property is just 2 blocks from the convention center. We were told to check back in the morning to see if any Luxe room became available. 

The World Tower room was nice, but very small. At just 360 sq ft, this is the smallest room I've ever stayed in in Las Vegas (and the Story Tower rooms are just 320 sq ft!). And the layout of the room is awkward, with the bed under the window, facing the door. All the typical amenities were available, but there was no bath robe or slippers. A standard for a 4+ star hotel.

As for the rest of the resort, the pool is rather nice, if some what small. Since it was mid week, we had no problems getting daybeds either day. Rather nice was our ability to bring outside food & drinks into the pool area (not so sure this would be tolerated on weekends). There are several restaurants that all look good, but we dined elsewhere (all the restaurants are brands that can be found in LA). The casino is a little on the small side, devoted mostly to slots. It only has 2 craps table. Being mid week, the casino was practically empty. Also, the resort has very limited shopping option, a typical hotel gift shop and several Fred Segal stores.

On our 2nd day we received a comp'd upgrade to Luxe Tower. Now this room is nice. Easily twice the size of the World Tower room (but also 2x the price online). The room has a very unique layout with nice facilities and amenities (robe, slippers, shaving kit, body scrubbing pad, etc.). The dichotomy from the World Tower room was very noticeable. I can easily return to this resort if I am staying in the Luxe Tower. 

Another thing, at check in, we mentioned that we had been to the SLS hotels in Miami Beach & Beverly Hills, but had read some concerning reviews about the SLS Las Vegas property. We were then actually told that the SLS LV is not to the same standards as the other SLS properties & the room price reflects that. While I agree the the price for their LV resort is much less than MB & BH, I don't know why they would want to dilute their brand name by offer rooms that are much lower quality than their other properties.

Overall, the staff was very nice, but the rooms and resort amenities don't compete with other LV resorts. Their's no scene here, no reason for people to seek out this property to visit and party out. They don't have a show and being on the north side of the strip can be difficult (especially if you don't have a car). We would only stay here again if we get a great deal on a Luxe Tower room & if all the rooms were to the caliber of the Luxe rooms, this could easily be the hottest hotel on the strip.",2,0,0

They did an absolutely exceptional job on rehabbing the old girl. Obviously, the rooms are smallish by today's Las Vegas standards but they're immaculate (they're almost new after all). Excellent water pressure and hot water in the bathroom. The bed was exceptionally comfortable - easily on par with Aria. Housekeeping was excellent. The only issue some people will have is the lack of storage space. There are open shelves next to the mini-bar and a rather small area to hang clothes that need it but no drawers. 

There was no wait to check in at about 1:00 PM when we arrived. As usual we checked out using the TV system so there was no wait there either. I have no idea why anyone stands in line to check out anymore unless there's an issue with the bill (which you can view on-screen at any time). 

The casino isn't really as small as people seem to be suggesting. They have good, low minimum table games and some excellent video poker. 

We ate at Umami Burger and the Northside Cafe - both very good for what they are. As usual with Las Vegas resorts, a little expensive but in line with other resorts. the sports book (operated by William Hill) is located in Umami Burger and there's also an outdoor beer garden adjacent.

It was too chilly to use it, but the pool area looks great. 

Although it's at the end of the strip it's still pretty easy to get around either by using the monorail or taking a shot taxi or bus ride. Wynn\/Encore is about a 15 minute walk.

No Bathroom Fan: There are 2 switches in the bathroom, only one turns on the fan.

The room was very clean, the bed and pillows were soft and comfortable, and the lighting was great. If you're looking to get pampered I tried the detox scrub at the Away Spa and it was absolutely FANTASTIC! The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the restaurant choices. Not that the restaurants weren't nice because they were! However, they're all a little pricier and close kind of early. At least have one restaurant or cafe that stays open late for something to eat after going to a show or club!

Price will not be over the top, on average it moves less expensive compared to other fancy hotels on the strip. While at the hotel you can find your choices of good values or choose to pay for self spoiling...hey it's Vegas ;) 

The pool is great! Perfect size for the hotel. Not too crowded and allows for easy meet and greet with other guests.

Restaurant choices you have most of what you need, some people cannot live without a buffet and you will not find one at SLS. Then again this is not resort size Vegas hotel. A buffet of more of the same as other hotels would not benefit SLS with its customer profile IMO. You have burgers, you have noodles, and great offers at the sports book bar for food.

Sport book, a no frills really cool by the side of the beer garden which I like the airy view. Now we just need people to walk on the sidewalk. Or move it to the corner to get a view of the strip. But great big LCD screens, service and atmosphere.

Bars, you can have your pick, from live music which was my favorite, drink on the high price side but the boutique feeling of the live music bar\/club made me feel that the drinks are worth it. Few of the bar tenders need to have more of ""make it a repeat customer"" thing in mind, not a let me bleed you this one time. Other bar tenders do have the perfect mind and treat you to welcome you back the following night. Bars in the casino area are cool and LIFE nightclub was closed. There was another club that had a huge line and velvet rope behavior, so I did not care for it. 

Rooms were great, fresh and new. Spacious, AC worked perfectly and TV is an awesome 60 in. You almost don't want to leave your room! Comfy bed and black out blinds. I did not need them as I went from the boutique Sayers Club live music place to shower to airport :p

Only downside to the room was occasionally the music from Foxtail Nightclub would finds its way up to the room. Also if you are staying during the week watch out for an earlier than 8:00am wake up call they are doing construction right by the World tower.  Pools were a lot of fun, although if you are not a 20-something looking to party and mingle hit the Lux pool instead of the Foxtail pool, a lot more seating available. Food is fantastic for those staying at the hotel I would highly recommend Katsuya their sushi was delicious.

anyways, i enjoyed my stay at this hotel... the only down side is that its too damn far from everything else.  i seriously have no idea why the sls decided to open up at the old Sahara location.   think about it...  why did the sahara location close down?  i'm pretty sure its because it was too far from everything else and had nothing to offer.   i will honestly give the SLS hotel about 3 years before it files for bankruptcy, from the lack of traffic it gets.  (with the lack of traffic, i will assume they will jack up their slots games to worse odds as well)

when i found out this hotel was 360 sq, i was a bit worried.  but when i walked in.. it wasn't too bad.  granted tho, the beds are twin sized.  extremely small.  its honestly meant for 1 person.  or two very skinny people.  lol
the door of the bathroom was also weird.  it doesn't lock, its just a sliding door.
the coolest thing about this place was the mirrors.  2 mirrors on each side of the wall, and when you turn on the lights, it'll give the impression that you're looking into an infinity mirror.  

i didn't like the lay out of the casino floor.  it was kinda weird, but then again i can't complain much.  i came up on the roulette table.  thank you sls! 

the sports betting place was mixed in with a restaurant.  kinda weird since most sports betting places usually have the two seperated.

CONS: Rooms are really small; feels like practical gave way to modern style; lack of attendants and signage to direct patrons from the parking lot to the front desk; far from the strip; Options for games and food are fewer than other hotels

Overall, I can't strongly say that my experience here was good or bad, but that's mostly because the hubs and I didn't really stay at the hotel for much of anything. As soon as we checked in, we dropped off our bags and took the tram to the strip to hang out there.

Typically when we come to Vegas we stay at the Venetian or Palazzo only. I read some good reviews and saw the incredible pricing and thought I'd try something new. Wow. Within 12 hours of our stay I had come into contact with front desk, housekeeping, pool attendants and someone who worked at a food spot and seriously I have NEVER met more friendly people. Each person went far above and beyond their duty and with a huge smile on their face. From Eiline at the front desk who personally walked us to the foxtail beach club to make sure we received our promotion as well as knew where we were going ; ) ... To Dawn at the roulette table who was patient as I learned how to play the game and fed us secrets about the hotel (where to eat, facts about the pictures and cool scenery we should check out around the hotel). The staff is ON POINT at this hotel, seriously you will find no greater elsewhere.

As for the rooms I was also pleasantly surprised! Our first night we stayed in the story room (grey and yellow, mirror on the ceiling) it was very tidy and cool but definitely on the smaller end. The second night we switched to the World tower rooms and we are so so happy here. Beautiful room, ample amount of space, very modern yet calming and peaceful feel! Whoever designed the rooms, hallways and decor did an awesome job. Though smaller in general, this hotel is SO well put together! The modern and trendy feel mixed with the classic photos and artwork from Vegas' past are the perfect combo!

The elevators not working on opening day is a huge problem. Luckily I'm able to climb four flights of stairs, but many patrons aren't. Inside the casino the floors were dirty. It looked like there was hay from a farm animal? I saw two employees manning the players card area. The line for a new card was wrapped around the entrance and black jack tables making it difficult to make your way into the cramped casino. I played a few slots for about 45 minutes without seeing a single cocktail waitress. As I was leaving and thirsty I did see one waitress carrying a single beer on her tray. Any other casino on opening day would have waitresses out in full force feeding patrons booze and trying to get them to stay.

Arrival area(s) are kind of messed up.  They have two, one in the front for the casino and one in the back for the hotel.  As a first timer I pulled into the wrong one.  Had a long walk to check-in.
Check-in area is very small and had lines every time I walked past it.
My room in the Lux Tower was very cool, but a little overpriced.
Lots of very nice amenities in the bath. Tons of stuff.
Bed was comfortable, and the window from the bedroom into the shower was kind of sexy.  As was the mirror on the ceiling above the bed.
Couldn't find light switches on the lamps when entering room after dark.
Long lines at the reasonably priced restaurants.
Buffet is way in the back of the hotel and expensive.  Didn't try it.
No showrooms here. But the hotel has direct access to a Monorail station for a fast trip to shows along the strip.
Several clubs that looked pretty cool.  Only one of the three was open the night I visited.  In Miami\/South Beach SLS throws a mean pool party, suspect they do the same here.
They closed the pool early due to a private party.  Tells you a lot about what is important to the management.
For a large resort they have a small, very small, gym. 
Staff seemed very nice and friendly.
They have several ""Fred Segal"" stores with various merchandise.  This old brand is quickly fading in the Los Angeles area.  What is it doing at a new hip SLS hotel?

I booked the room in November and nabbed an amazing deal with a low rate and $40 in food\/beverage credits per night. For three nights, we paid a total of $375 ($25\/night resort fee included) and got $120 'back' in credits. Curio hotels are also now owned by Hilton and so if you're a HHonors member, you're set! You can also join their 'Code' club and I've already received multiple emails for 50% off room rates (put nights at ~$52).

Check in was a bit painful, primarily with other patrons taking for forever at the desk and the fact that they didn't have many reps available. But when it was our turn, everything was nice and quick as we had our cards and reservation confirmation ready. We were asked for our HHonours card after the rep saw our Hilton credit card and he upgraded our room per our (then) Gold status. This was wonderful as we ended up in a larger suite, on a higher floor.

For the rooms, we loved the decor. We stayed in the 'World' tower and from the elevator lobby, to the hallways, were impressed. We had a king bed and loved the sitting couch at the end. The giant mirrors on either wall allowed for easy makeup application while the bathroom was in use. My husband outlined the shower was the best he had encountered and I loved the minty toiletries provided. Every detail down to the old Vegas map on the desk, was very well thought out. We didn't encounter issues with the walls or windows being thin. We faced Sahara at the Strip and so would notice street noise, and there were huge windstorms, and we were fine. The rooms aren't massive, but you're in Vegas and no one spends time in a room anyhoo. Plus, the exact square footage is outlined on their website in the room description, and so you can't bitch about small when you know this up front. Same goes for the resort fee. Educate yourself. 

We loved the restaurant options and the $40 voucher really went a long way. Cleo was our absolute favorite and Unami has wonderful burgers. We didn't gamble at all and wished that the outdoor pool area would have been open for lounging as it looked wonderful. This hotel is at the far end of the strip, but the monorail is attached and the bus picks up right out front. Cab rides are also only ~$11 to the Linq area.

The main cons that we encountered during our visit were no coffee machine in the room (oddly I found this quite an inconvenience), wait times for elevators are hell at 11am (check out), and the front desk line up reeeeeally needs to be better configured. Having parallel lines blocks the entire hallway and it would be better to have one line that feeds to all reps vs getting stuck in a slow line with people who aren't properly prepared.

Our room was ok the curtains that have paintings on them are strange and cheap why not just paint the walls instead. House keeping was a bit strange it was very surface not deep cleaning like you normal see. They never replaced our cups for new ones. The hallways to our room smells and the doors and walls need a good repaint and sand job. I saw lots of corners that were chipped which is a bad look. The charges that everyone says that are for random things do appear on your credit card which we will address with them. 

They need some work with this hotel a deep cleaning a contractor to help fix the damages around the property and a painter so they get rid of these cheap panels with flor de lay print. The restaurants and nightlife venues are the best! With some work the hotel can get better.",3,0,0

First impressions are important and my first thought after 10 minutes was ""wow, what a complete fail"". They weren't even close to being ready to being open. The decor was terrible, if you're one that thinks a painting with a splatter on it is worth 25k then you might be impressed. It came across as cheesy and trying too hard. I've seen others compare it to a poor version of the Cosmo on a budget, with a weird monkey twist. 100% accurate. Hyde has it's quirks but I'm actually a fan so I was really looking forward to LiFE. For an SBE  property to have it's own signature venue you think it'd go far and beyond. I entered and my first thought was it's a cheap knock off of a club from the strip, and we all left feeling the same. The scene was terrible and way over crowded. When we go out at the Cosmo or Wynn I don't mind paying because I'm at a 5 star resort, everything is class and quality, I feel like I get my moneys worth. This place is a 2.5 star resort with higher prices than the Cosmo, go figure. I don't gamble but the guys in our group were underwhelmed by the gaming floor and it did seem super tight. The food was the only bright spot as we ate at Bazaar and we definitely had a great meal. The decor, gaming, nightlife and staff need a complete do over. I'm afraid SBE dropped the ball and if they don't fix it fast, it maybe too late. Went with a party of 9, not one of us left impressed. I think the biggest surprise was how cheap it felt, I think half the budget went to marketing and hype. Save yourself the disappointment, money and inconvenience of leaving the strip for the ghetto and stay away. The reviews don't lie.",7,4,1

Room had comfy beds & a nice large LED TV on the wall.  Blood stains on the comforter, blinds & couch were not a welcome sign.  Housekeeping left a filthy wet rag on our table too... Not a single trash can in our room either (used the ice bucket as one instead).  Nicely updated bathroom though the sliding frosted glass door had no lock to use (weird). 

What made this experience horrible was the fact that the cleaning lady STOLE a very expensive pair of sunglasses from my room (mint like brand new $1,400 pair of Chrome Hearts sunglasses that I highly cherished & treasured - left in the safe but someone forgot to lock again with our pin code before we left after grabbing a watch) & management would take absolutely no responsibility for the theft.  We were gone for less than 1-1\/2 hours.  Security did help me determine that the only time another person entered our room was the cleaning person (electronic locks so they can determine when the door is opened), so was clearly evident that the sunglasses were taken by that lady.  Of course the whole time security was interviewing me, they gave me a very skeptical response (I guess there are unscrupulous individuals that have given them trouble for false claims in the past?).  That made me feel as if I was the criminal & my own integrity was being questioned, but I can understand how someone can't believe a pair of sunglasses could cost that much... 

LAURA KUICK, the head of risk management, gave me a super lousy & disrespectful attitude, barely giving me a few minutes of her time to help me resolve the situation.  Brushed me off quickly over the phone after security looked into the matter.  No apology or understanding demeanor.  Simply informed me that they were not liable for any thefts from the rooms, even when it was obvious that their employee stole the item. 

Be warned, this establishment will not take any accountability or responsibility for THEIR OWN employees STEALING your property!!!  Terrible experience to end my stay in Vegas this time around!!!",4,0,1

Some of the casino is filled with old relics, stripped down ceilings, eclectic mix of monkey pictures, and various classic old time pictures can be found on walls, carpets, employees uniforms. 

The casino is a little away from what people call the strip. Quiet this casino can be but service and quality are not compromised. 

Various staff are helpful and willing to answer questions. A simple rewards card program is available to sign up for free play. My card had an issue and slot staff were helpful and quick to provide assistance. 

Walk ways are large. Decor is chic. Very clean (couldn't smell smoke).
Some bars and restaurant are not open until early evening. Signage was clear. 

Good friendly efficient staff. 
Bad lost some money. Wish restaurants and bars were better hours. 

Things to check out: monkey pictures, old classic pictures around and in the art gallery, employee uniform, reverse kaleidoscope, and outdoor artwork. 


Center Bar

One of two main bars located in the old Sahara new SLS casino.


Bar staff was friendly and prompt when free. We ordered some house special artesian cocktails and some everyday drinks. 

Among those cocktails ordered was  Jasmines Margarita, and a Perry Alexander. 

Both drinks hit a good mark on  alcohol and flavor. The margarita with pomegranate juice was refreshing. The Perry Alexander was similar to a chocolate espresso. Not too creamy (dairy). 

We had ordered other various beverages while gambling at the bar. A few martinis from the two bar tenders helping my friends and I. Ordered mixed and fairly made with care. Both bartenders took the time to listen to requests. 

Good: fresh made from scratch drinks, friendly and efficient staff. 
Bad: wish there was more artesian choices.

The entire hotel including our room was very clean. The casino isn't overwhelmingly smokey like some can be. I really liked the hotel decor, the art in the elevators was very unique. The bed was very comfortable, the shower had great pressure and the TV was bigger than usual hotel rooms. Good channel selection too. SLS is great if, like us, you want to experience Vegas but not be right in the middle of the madness. There were always people around the common areas but not to the point where you are pushing through crowds or can't find a chair by the pool. It's just a bit more low key, which I loved. We did not rent a car, found it very easy to use the metro rail from the hotel. I found all the staff really friendly and helpful as well. Also enjoyed watching the playoffs at Unami burger right inside the hotel. If I have any future trips to Vegas this will be my go to hotel.",1,0,1

I was actually concerned after reading negative reviews about noise etc, but our room was so quiet I heard nothing.  The room was so big; the shower\/bathroom was also spacious too.  I loved it.

Their gym is also modern and it has a decent # of equipment to work with.

We didn't go to the pool party, but went to their smaller size Lux (?) pool.  It is small, but they play good sets of music and the service is nice and fast.  I stopped going into the pool at one point bc it was getting too murky.

The hotel is, however, located far away from the strip and there is only one bodega with limited option.  You just have to be prepared.

PROS
- Checked in on a Saturday at around 5pm. Check-in was quick and easy.
- Comfortable bed. One pillow is a little hard but still comfy. I usually take naps in between to recover from day clubbing and the bed got me knocked out. 
- Mirrors will get you mirin yourself 
- Distance: 4-5 mins away from clubs located at far north end strip like XS and EBC.

CONS
- Hallways look dark and uninviting. Also, smells like a mixture of feet and popcorn.
- I've never had to wait in line to use the elevator until my stay here. After checking in, it took 10 mins to get on the elevator. Upon checking out, there seemed to be only 2 functioning elevators and each time it stopped on our floor, there was no room for us to get in. We ended up walking down 8 flights of stairs because we had already waited 20 mins and didn't want to wait any longer. 
- Room decor was strange, confusing, and a little creepy. The curtain was an enlarged photo of a crowd looking out.. Kind of looked Hitler-ish to me. We left the curtain up.... Didn't want to sleep with this image above us. 

Overall, hotel was okay. I only stayed here because this was the hotel I received when I booked through Hotwire but even then it was still pricey.",1,0,0

Aside from the hotel, I had events planned thank goodness that made up for the mishap. For the hotel, booked World tower then decided to upgrade to Lux, so I contacted the SLS, they told me no problem when Check-in. Two week prior to my trip, I called again to confirm I was able to upgrade. I really wanted this weekend perfect and that was planned for several months. Was assure no problem in upgrading to the LUX upon arrival. 

Arrived last Friday night, not only did they give my room away on a high floor king, there was no upgrade available (due to convention-WHICH TWO WEEK PRIOR I SHOULD OF BEEN INFORMED THERE NO UPGRADES!!). They instead gave a low floor two full bed option. FULL BED- not on Birthday weekend. More to it I will not get into, but to top off our pool day after flying out day before, it was closed (due to event). Only option was the Foxtail Day Club, which was not the relaxation desired and you have to pay to get into) Leaving out SO many details, for the inconvenience I was offered a $25 food\/beverage credit and they waved they little resort fee. THAT WAS IT. Oh, yea, the shitty room I got in Story Tower which was less, NO FUCKIN ICE MACHINE OR BUCKETS. I contacted corporate and the hotel main, they are they ones that dropped the little resort fee, the pathetic hotel gave the 25 credit - if they made up the inconvenience, I would not be writing this. i gave them week to fix, never again.

She was so sweet and kind and extremely  friendly and put us in a good mood. We arrived and checked in early, so I requested minibar service as it had not been re stocked yet. At the front counter, the woman that helped us at the counter, I don't remember her name but it started with an R, left a lot to be desired. She wasn't too friendly and you can tell her job took a toll on her emotionally. She just wasn't as welcoming as front desk staff should be.  The hotel over all is nice, but leaves a lot to be desired. No ice machines, you actually have to go down to the coffee shop on ground floor and request ice unless you schedule a delivery. The rooms are obviously decorated to be extremely low budget for the hotel and they try to play it off as being artsy and modern, but it's no excuse for being cheap and the frugal spending habits of this place on guest services shows very much.  The phone in my room had a cracked screen. Nobody answered the phone at concierge desk even after a half hour wait
 Finally got thru to an operator who connected me to guest services. Unacceptable even for a 3 star hotel. The information about everything in this place is scarse. Make sure you ask questions about everything you can because nobody will tell you except for room service staff, who seem to be the only friendly staff in the building. Honestly I would have given this place a 2 star review if it weren't for danielle. For a hotels saving grace to be someone who stocks our mini fridge says a lot. But she definitely is someone who needs to be in charge of more, because the rest of our experience is already lacking. I can tell the guest service is going to be lacking. I can tell that the rooms were hastily put together by someone looking to save some cash and definitely someone who probably fantasized about interior design in middle school. Mediocre.",0,0,0

Though I am impressed with how ""different"" SLS is from the old Sahara casino...some things should have been taken into consideration. For example: (Opening Day)

SPACE!!! The casino gaming area is too small and easily gets crowded and congested in my opinion. Imagine being inside a very busy packed night club, but with slot machines and game tables everywhere!!! Not pleasant. It felt like a bumper car ride at a carnival, trying to avoid getting bumped into!!!

BATHROOMS: Dirty and neglected!! Trash piled up high and falling over from the wall mounted trash cans!! Water splats all over the entire sink counter, and used up paper towels on the floor!! You could tell the bathroom had not been inspected for cleanliness or cleaned for most of the day!! I left the bathroom with a bad first impression. Geez...the 11 year old Emerald Casino in Henderson has waaaaay cleaner (spotless) bathrooms than the just opened SLS!!! 

CARPET: What was up with those weird looking fur things that resembled rolled up, dried up hairballs a cat coughs up, all over the entire carpet?!! Not appealing to look at!!

HOTEL OPERATIONS: No excuses!! If you consider yourself a ""luxury"" resort...then your establishment needs to be on top of cleanliness!!! Dirty bathrooms, trash and filthy carpets are unapologetic, if you want to make and leave a good impression on your patrons!! (SLS-Style LUXURY Service)

CEILING: They went for the exposed (pipes, vents, wiring)  and open ceiling ""industrial"" look...baffling, since it really does not go well with the rest of the casino luxury theme. That exposed ceiling decor belongs more at a gym.

SAM STATUE: Hmmm...beauty is in the eye of  beholder I guess... :\/

PARKING GARAGE: Non working elevators on opening day?!! Lucky for me, I got an immediate prime parking space right on the main floor & did not need to use the elevator. Also, they had cones blocking the exit way to leave the garage when I left!! A valet guy had to move them cause they were meant for the entrance & not the exit!!

What a shame and blown opportunity to become known as a huge hero!!! SLS could have made an impression that left the tourist and especially the locals saying: SLS...the resort that revived and saved the north end of The Strip for Las Vegas, NV!!!

I still believe this place has hope and potential...but not for long, if they don't make changes for the better and soon!! This place is a diamond in the rough that needs some SERIOUS polishing!!!!

Now for the good!! On food, drinks, service and shopping experience: (Reason for my 3 Stars)

UMAMI BURGER: Excellent, tasty, delicious food and great service!!! The place to eat, drink, gamble, watch & bet on sports!! Great outdoor beer garden patio, facing the Vegas Strip. Our bartender by the name of Amber was not only sweet, friendly and great, she gave superb food & drink recommendations: The Sahara Cooler, Truffle Fries and the Manly Burger-a cooked to order, juicy steak meat burger with bacon, melted cheddar and crispy batter fried onions on a warm buttered brioche bun...need I say more?? YUM!!!!!!!!!! 

FRED SEGAL HOME: Small but well stocked unique boutique!! Distinctive concept and decor store. The Store Manager Eric was very helpful and gave excellent customer service and left us with a wonderful shopping experience!! 

STAFF at SLS: Wow...talk about friendly customer service with a smile!!! Everyone we had to encounter from the bartenders, wait staff, security guard, Code card associates, parking attendants, gave excellent customer service!!! Helpful, friendly and very resourceful!!! 

I am intrigued to come back and experience everything else SLS has to offer. One thing is for sure. This casino was not built to cater to the gambler, but to adjust to what is the ""now"" trend and the bread and butter of the  Vegas casinos; Shopping, Dinning and Night Life! Vital and needed to stay afloat!! 

The Sahara casino floor was mainly used up to house 3 night clubs, and 8 restaurants, along with the Fred Segal stores that are spread out throughout the property. That is were all the gaming space from the former Sahara went. 

If the food at Umami  Burger was phenomenal ...I can only imagine at 800, Cleo, Katzuya, The Griddle Cafe, Bazaar Meats,etc...

I did not stay or get to see the rooms at the hotel. (I live in Las Vegas)

I would love to come back and lounge at their pool. It looked very inviting.",9,4,3

First, the woman at checkin couldn't find our reservation, and rather than try and solve the problem professionally, she became accusatory as if I'd done something wrong. Shortly thereafter, she was able to track down this elusive reservation and proceed with the checkin, but her sour attitude did not change--and I'm one of the most patient and understanding people I know. To be treated in such a way was completely undeserved and just beyond me. 

My other negative exchange came from calling the front desk because my television was acting up. Once I was put on hold for more than 15 minutes. And when I called back, I was put on hold without even getting so much as a hello on the other end.  

These may seem like small things, but when you have high hopes, it almost ruins a trip when the staff can't show you some common courtesy.

You know how when you were little if you loved something so much you said you would marry it?! Well consider me wifey of this place. Yes, it's kind of away from the main part of the strip but who cares? It's super clean, classy, smells good and very modern décor. No lie, there was no cigarette smell when I walked into the casino. One thing I don't like also about the main casinos and resorts is that some are very outdated. This place is very attention to detail with the pretty lights, sparkly disco balls and artwork. I hear it's fairly reasonably priced as well. And it's very close to Fremont St\/downtown old Vegas so you can quickly Uber or cab it there for some fun. The monorail has a stop here as well so quick access back to the main part of the strip. There is the cutest non Starbucks coffee shop and restaurants inside.

We had to come to Vegas for a few days and since we are SPG Platinum members, we decided to give it a shot.  

We arrive and park.  First first annoyance, when you use self park it leads you to the 5th floor.  Then there are no signs pointing you towards check in.  So we take the elevator down to the first floor and start looking for signs.  There were none.  So we walked around to the front of the casino and enter just to find out the check in desk is basically where we came from.  

So we find the registration desk and we notice the two lines.  One line for regular guests and the other for SPG Gold and Platinum members.  We start walking to the SPG line when a staff member told us to get in the other line.  I tell him we are Platinum members and he said, ""It doesn't matter.  It's all the same.""  It was dark and it happened so fast I couldn't see his name.  So we said ok and got in the regular line.  We wait our turn and we see a space at the registration desk after a receptionist finished with a guest.  We waited thinking she would cal us up but she just looked at us.  We waited about 30 seconds longer then just walked up.  According to her name tag, her name is Ira.  She welcome us and begins checking us in.  She says thank you for being Gold members and we said we are Platinum.  So said oh well I have to confirm that.  Ok, so she checks our status and checks us in.  No room upgrade and she said all she has is a handicap or smoking room available.  We take the handicap room since it's the only non smoking room available. 

We get to our room and first it smells like smoke.  I go to the bathroom and it smells like mildew.  I turn on the TV and there is no volume.  I pick up the phone to call the front desk and the phone doesn't work!!!  Lol......  So I call the hotel from my cell phone and Hope answers.  She asks where I need to be transferred and I tell her I don't know to who but I'm in room 917 and the TV doesn't work nor does the phone.  She very rudely tells me, ""Well you don't need to be transferred anywhere.  I can fix that.""  I said ok and she again asks me what's wrong with the TV.  I again told her the TV had no volume.  She reset the TV and told me to wait a few min before turning it on.  Then asked what was wrong with the phone.  I told her it didn't work.  She said she has to send an engineer for that.  I said ok.....

So bottom line, staff here are very rude and if that's how they treat Platinum members, then I wonder how they treat the every day guest here.  We will not stay here ever again and we are working on changing out reservation to the W next door....

UPDATE:

So it took someone 4 hours to attempt to fix the broken phone in the room.  First he called and told me to unplug the phone and plug it back in.  Then he would call in a few min to see if it worked.  So I did and he called back.  Now the phone didn't work at all.  When I answered I could to hear anything nor could anyone hear me.  So it it's worse.  The tech said he would come up to check it.  He came up and checked the phone and sketch board.  He said he would go down, reprogram the phone and come back.  He asked if we were going anywhere because he can't be in the room without us here.  I said we were going down to grab food and we would be right back up.  This is around 7:30 ish.  We eat and come back up to our room.   We waited for hours and never heard from him.  I ended up falling asleep around 10:30 and I was woken up by someone keying into my room.  I looked at the front door and it was opening and some woman said, ""Security.""  I yelled, ""Close my door!""  I woke up and walked to the door.  The tech and a security guard was there.  I asked what gave them permission to key into my room?  They just said sorry.  I can't think of any reason they should be going into my room.  Especially just to plug back in a phone......  So I took the phone and closed the door.

Review #18:
brand new and super-cool; rising from the ashes of the Sahara, there has been so much thought & artistic touches put into this place; the wall art is really interesting, and even the carpeting is cool in many spots; love the creepy monkey theme as well; exposed ceiling piping and lighting give the place a very modern & industrial feel; even the hotel check-in area is eye-catching; this is the place I'm going to take out-of-town visitors as a counterpoint to the more traditional\/commercial Strip casinos; the restaurants are cool, especially the wide open plan of Bazaar Meat; even the 2nd floor buffet room is different & inviting; be sure to check out the 2nd floor photo gallery & clocks theme; Umami Burger includes the world's smallest sports book; best craft beer bet = it's clearly the outdoor ""beer garden"" area of Umami, but quite frankly I was a bit disappointed with their selection (no American craft dark beers at all - wha?)",1,0,0

I'm being very generous with 1 star as my experience at SLS Hotel wasn't very pleasant. First of all, I'm not one to post regarding mishaps but felt that it would be an injustice if I did not warn others of this place they call a resort. If you're use to Las Vegas customer service, you won't get it here. We frequent LV at least 2-3 times a year with the family and adult trips as well. 

1) Front Desk - the person that checked me in, was very cold, not welcoming at all. I walked up saying ""good afternoon!"" And the first thing out of his mouth was ""ID Please..."" No ""hello, welcome to SLS...""  When I asked for more room keys because my kids (13 & 17) were traveling with us, his gesture and mannerism was heavy sigh, like it was an inconvenience to him. 
2) Spa - Decided to check out the ""resort"" (notice the quotations-I'll get back to that later). We were in shorts, tanks, and slippers, obvious that we weren't going to go ""into"" the gym but just to take a look. Again I greeted first ""good afternoon!"" No greeting back just a smile. I asked if I could just look at the gym and the only thing that the girl said was, ""you have to have closed toed shoes!"" I told her that I just wanted to look from the outside and she turned and walked away. Nice size gym, great equipment and pretty roomy. As my family was leaving, I turned, said ""thank you! Oh by the way, what time does the gym close?"" And the attendants response was, ""8pm and we're not a gym we're a spa."" My thoughts were, ""really, that's how you respond to your hotel guests?""
3) Security in Red Coat by Lux Tower - As my family was walking out, my husband asked, ""excuse me, where's the Lux pool?"" He told us...then I asked, ""why would the gym close by 8?"" His response, ""well everyone here is drunk by 10pm anyway..."" My thoughts, ""does he not see that we're with our under aged kids?""
4) Concierge - my husband was ironing his brand new shirt that I had just bought for a party we were going to, when the iron leaked rusted water on his shirt. I immediately called  the concierge and spoke with I believe her name was Glynnis. I told her the situation, asked for a new iron to get sent up...but she really never offered any suggestions or apologies regarding his shirt. I asked if they had dry cleaning services to see if possibly they could rush it and have it back in time for the party.  All she could say was for me to call the bellman and maybe they could do something. I went downstairs to the concierge's office and immediately recognized her voice, turning and saying that I had just spoken to her regarding the shirt. She had no smile on her face, no greeting, and was just very cold. And again suggested that ""I"" take it to the bellman and ""maybe"" they'll do something about it. 

I will admit, Valet guys were all very welcoming, pleasant and cordial. 
Robert, our bellman, was very nice, told us about local restaurants and was very engaging. 
Romeo, Manager in VIP Lounge, was very apologetic regarding all the mishaps. As I was leaving he said, ""I hope that we would be able to make it up to you on your next stay..."" My response, ""unless you work for another hotel, I know I'll never return to SLS.""
Northside Cafe - Lola and Tony were very nice! Thank you!

We stayed in the renovated story tower and the rooms are accurate as pictured. There was plenty of space for two people. The room was clean but no refrigerator or coffee maker. There was a mishap with check in and we were given the wrong room number but they made up for it with a $50 credit. The older tower definitely looks bad as we peeked in walking by but I never actually entered the older tower. We didn't try any of the restaurants. Lower limits in the casino compared to other strip hotels. The distance could be an inconvenience but we rented a car specifically because we stayed here.,0,0,0

Then the doors opened and it's been called weird, odd and disorganized. But if you think those are negative then you haven't fully grasped the SLS concept. As far as boutique hotel goes, if Cosmo is like being on cocaine: a little naughty and all fun, then the SLS is like an acid trip: all over the place and all fun. Not promoting drugs, just making a comparison. I personally like that there is a beautiful classic painted mural, then beside that, a strange modern art mural, then beside that a big wall of lights that doesn't make sense. The architecture  aspect is the same. some high ceiling in some spots and some low dipping points. There's a lot to take in but there are also a lot of small details that aren't noticeable until you stop to take a look. There's super high end restaurants like Bazaar Meat and there's casual less expensive ones like Perq. To loosely paraphrase Michael, this is not an ""everything for everyone"" spot but if you don't like what you see, shuffle 10 feet in any direction and you've got a new environment. There's something for everyone. 

Being as new as it is, there are still a lot of kinks to iron out and I wish SBE and the whole Code program would be easier to utilize, But overall the concept, the detail and the product itself is amazing.",4,3,2

The trendy-ness of the SLS is overbearing. Too much was put into the look and not the feel if you get me. It caters to the fake tan crowd, the new Vegas scene that's all night clubs and alcohol sponsored parties and not so much the Rat Pack days of elegance, but then there isn't too much of that left is there?   

Paid about $160 for the single night, and at that rate I expected a lot more than what I got.  
Maybe if I had paid out for a suite and not just the standard room the experience would have been better. There is one tiny sink in the standard room that is used as both the bathroom sink and the wet bar. The bathroom is giant so I don't understand why a sink couldn't have been put in the actual bathroom. The bathroom door is a sliding mirror that when open hides the tiny sink. At first it looks cool, but if you're trying to brush your teeth when someone comes out of the bathroom you'll get hit by the heavy sliding door. The room, which had  two double beds, was so tight that I was basically in the way of my roommate no matter where I stood. 
Check in was terribly slow, and house keeping was worse. I called to ask for a bathmat because there wasn't one in the room when I checked in and it never showed up. Had to use one of the regular bath towels to step out on because the bathroom is all tile and very slippery when wet. The bathroom is also bright yellow so at 3 am when you get up to pee in the, half drunk, you'll be blinded when you hit the light switch. 
Also, this is in the older section of Vegas, very close to the Stratosphere, and a good $12-$15 cab ride to the part of Vegas you actually want to be at (Caesar's, Flamingo, Bellagio).   

Bottom line, if you're not 23 and planing on spending your whole day at the pool skip this place, and ago ahead and spend the $200 a night to stay some place closer to the strip and a step up in class.",0,0,0

Unlike some of the mega resorts in Las Vegas which can be difficult to navigate, the SLS is well contained and simple - the casino is of moderate size, $5 craps tables a plus and the night clubs are located across the casino. Overall I'd give the SLS 3 stars and likely 4 stars, if you are on a budget and do not have access to comps at some of the other casinos.

We arrived at the hotel and unfortunately they did not have handicap parking for my wife who is a disabled veteran. We parked on the 3rd floor and then headed to the elevators. Unfortunately the elevators where not working as always!!! So I had to go back to the car to drop off my wife and the bags in the front and meet with her after I parked the car. On my way down I took the stairs and as soon as I entered the stairway there was an overwhelming smell of weed.
The check in process was over 30 minutes and it was 11pm at night!
Once we arrived at the room our room smelled like someone had kindly dropped a #2 before leaving!  NOT COOL. Trying to make the most of it we opened the door and let it air out.

When I spoke to someone in the marketing department I was told that could not be the case as everyone gets informed of that. After a few times going back and forward he agreed to waiving some charges as he mention that if I only would have  played in the casino it would have been easier to wave that! 
1st of all why does that matter . your staff failed to inform me of the extra charges, and 2nd of all I did spend over $500 in the casino and only because I didn't insert my card it doesn't count? I'll take my money elsewhere thank you very much!

Life reminds me a lot of Light at Mandalay Bay and Hakkasan. Life also uses aerial and costumed performers as a part of their club but the layout with their tables surrounding the main dance floor is similar to Hakkasan. It also caters towards the EDM crowd.

Foxtail is a really nice venue that opens out to the pool.   This club is mainly a hip hop club. It is bigger than Life only due to the pool. Both clubs are brand new so I can't really review them as they will still need some time to fix any kinks and smooth out the operations.

Based on my experience, this hotel is too expensive for the quality. It lacks character. There is nothing unique about this place. I love SLS in LA but this place forgot to add a WOW factor. Not to mention front desk does not have any phone manners. I would like to be referred to as Mrs. Thank you very much!

I did however like the contemporary rooms & check out the mini bar. A special boxed item for $15 bucks. Might come in handy :)",3,2,0

I discussed my experience and expressed my dis-satisfaction of how the hotel staff handled things during my stay. I was given an apology and was told they wanted to try and make up for what had happened. A week later I was reimbursed for half of what I spent on the hotel bill. Very pleased that they did that and for the quick response. 

Again, I probably would not stay at this hotel again in the future, but the fact that they responded to my review and compensated somewhat was very much appreciated and shows that they acknowledge the poor service and are trying to make things right. Hope for the best for SLS Las Vegas.",9,0,1

I came to SLS because all I needed was to sleep for a couple of hours and the price was the best compared to the rest of the hotels on the main strip.

From the moment we arrived, we found princess parking, had a quick & enjoyable time checking in, and found our room very quickly.  My favorite part of the SLS was how modern and luxurious the hotel was. The inside of the rooms are very quirky and  come equipped with large tv's and comfortable beds.

We called the front desk to get some ice sent to us, but it never came. Not sure what happens there. 

Overall, I'd stay there again. Especially the Story tower. Just beware, it's very small (we lucked out and got the corner room -- so it came with a bonus living room). 

Food options are great, especially the pizzeria. Went to grab a $7 personal pizza after hitting up LiFE to see 3lau. Interesting club, enjoyable, but not a very unique club.

Part of me loves them because they provided such great hospitality for my boyfriend and I. But then again...like what some reviews have noted, SLS is having some identity issues here. Long gone are hotels themed after Italy, Paris, Greek, or even Egyptian. But SLS....it's lost and confused. 

They try to be modern and ""in' like the Aria and Cosmopolitan....but they didn't quite succeed. 

**FRONT DESK: Front desk lobby was nothing to boast about. Actually...it was so low-key dark and hidden, I wouldn't be surprised if most people walk right past it. It's like they're embarrassed with their hotel. The front desk is almost the FIRST area tourists arrive to. Make the front desk area lively, make it grand and fancy!!

**CASINO: slow and dark. I don't get why some casinos make their casino so dark. Do you want your guest to get sluggish and sleepy!? Slot machines were tight as hell but blackjack tables were pretty good with a $10 minimum. 

**ROOMS: there are many different types of rooms. I went online to look at the room types and were kinda overwhelmed. There's the STORY TOWER which looked like something you will see in a NY boutique hotel. The rooms looked super small!!!!! The WORLD TOWER is a bit bigger and I would say that's your less than average hotel room. Best tower, to me, to stay at is the LUX TOWER. Everything was modern. The layout was cleverly done. Dual sinks, dual-headed shower stall with one that's overhead. (hope thats making sense). Towels were fully stocked and clean. They provided robes and slippers. Beds were super comfy. 
****NOTE****: some of you will love it, some will hate it, but there's a ton of mirrors around the room. Even one above the bed!!!!!!! Wow ;) I personally enjoyed it. 

Restaurants and nightlife seems to be the only positive factors about this hotel that's keeping it alive.",14,4,4

The first minute in our room and we ran into the first issue. The bathroom had a huge sliding mirror door, fine idea but the sink is outside of the bathroom. So, if someone is washing their hands and someone else is going into the bathroom the hand washer gets smashed with the door. Another thought, the sink is outside the bathroom, so unless you drop one with the door half open and slip through the crack and the slip through the crack on the sink side to wash your hands you're forced to touch the door with doodoo hands. 

While we're on hand washing, the hotel provides those stupid little bars of soap but no soap dish so the terrible little bar just chills on the sink top getting soap water all over. 

The next thing we found out was that there was an ice bucket but no ice machine. We called to ask if maybe we just failed to find the ice machine on our floor and we were told, no we didn't, they don't have them. Of we wanted ice we had to order it to the room. 

Other than that the room was ok, but small. The beds, which were also small, to fit in the small room, light up (the head boards) as well as the couch. So, if you're into that sort of thing, there you go. 

If you stay here just remember to bring your own ice, your own soap dish, and some antibacterial wipes for the doodoo covered doors.",5,4,1

As a local, I want to be able to experience the hotel myself and the restaurants that it had to offer and I can honestly say I DID NOT have a good experience with all the restaurants that I've dined in or even attempted to. I know I will NOT RECOMMEND this hotel to my friends and guests from out of town.

First experience I had, it was okay. My significant other and myself wanted to eat at Umami Burger and after checking the reviews online and checking the hours, we found out that it was closed and we had arrived around 11 PM. Disappointed, we decided to dine in the Ku Noodle. This was the only restaurant that met our expectations, but the prices were WAY too over priced for the amount of food that we received. You are better off getting food in any local Chinese restaurant in Spring Mountain.

Next time around, my significant other decided to attempt another try with Umami Burger a week later. We arrived around 10 PM because the website states they are open until 2 AM and found it again CLOSED. We left because it was disappointing and we were trying to eat there but it never seemed like a good time.

My boyfriend really wanted to try it one more time and we already had a bad experience with valet (there are NO SIGNS to indicate whether or not valet was full and when we had asked, valet was incredibly rude and impatient) so we had to park in self park. But before this, I had called the hotel and asked customer service if Umami Burger was open. They stated they were open and I asked them to verify it and I would wait. I explained that we had tried twice and checked the web site and that it was open until 2 AM. The customer service agent checked and stated they were indeed open. 

Were they open when we got there? NO! I was so irritated I went to the front desk and complained. I asked why I got two confirmations that the restaurant was open and it was closed! All I got was an apology and that it was ""being looked at."" Nothing to make the situation better such as changing the information on the website or communicating it to the hotel staff. 

Very irate, my boyfriend offered to take me to Griddle Cafe. When we were asking for the table, my boyfriend was not pleased with the hostess because she did not smile and she was horrible at her job! This dark haired hostess did not wear her name tag and she actually rolled her eyes when my boyfriend asked for a booth. We also were served by a young man who was NOT good at all! He never checked on us, we waited 20 minutes to order, look past us when we needed something, and was never around when we needed him.

DO NOT GO TO SLS and their restaurants! They hire the WORST people ever and they need to screen better when it comes to hiring people! These employees need more education and training on customer service and if they don't like their job, work somewhere else!

It presents itself as a higher end chic boutique hotel, but what you actually get are cheap small rooms and the service is terrible! We spent over $600 in a day just with lunch, dinner & some modest gambling, then after having some fun at the tables, ran into a snag with a defective keno machine! Soon after we realize this machine was broken, we called over a floor attendant. Two other individuals arrived, after it was clear She did not know what or how to repair this machine. One of the individuals was a Manager, I believe Mark. He offered what the balance was on the machine, meanwhile we had another $20 plus that we invested\/inputed; I immediately told him, that NO we wanted a full refund, he rudely refused my request. Subsequently, we called the Hotel Manager, they tried to reach a Casino Manager, but to avail. The front desk person, I believe Chris, related he would go ahead and not charge us an resort fee!? I was like, ok we were not aware of this fee, but anything helps.
The rest of evening, no call or any other communication was offered by the Hotel or Casino to address this rude Casino representative. I then took to Facebook & Twitter to note our disappointment and how SLS ruined our Valentine's weekend...well of course the 'canned' response was, were not pleased, email your experience and we'll follow up... So again, spent more time, received a reply via email from a Casino Supervisor, who basically said screw you, my Manager is great! lol - Awesome, thanks for scolding us for stating otherwise! 

Anyhow, save your $'s & go to a cheap hotel, or for a really awesome high end Hotel that lives up to the hype. visit the Mandarin Oriental; MO Is the real deal, not some fake wanna be hip hotel, who's staff are completely and utterly disrespectful!

Called front desk to complain about the sound and here is what the front desk said, "" Yes M'am, you are correct, we are under construction at the moment."" I said, "" I got woken up by the sound... and this is a hotel... why would you guys even have these rooms available when you can hear the constructions?""

Then I called to ask for some hot water to be delivered... They said there will be a $5 delivery charge. Ridiculous! Never have I ever heard of a hotel charging $5 for hot water delivery... seriously.. WTF....
Then we went to the front desk to pick up our drink voucher, the front desk said just charge it to your room and we will take care of it. 
Few days later, I see an additional $48 was charged on my credit card. Called SLS, they said it was because we took a beverage from the mini bar and we ordered two drinks from the Monkey bar. OMG... ARE U SERIOUS?!?
I explained the situation - she said ok we will refund the minibar charge, however, I do not see any notes regarding a drink voucher. I said well your staff double checked and said that it was there. She said I'm sorry M'am but I do not see any note. There was a moment of silent.

I said to her, "" It is your staff's fault that they fail to dictate our conversation. Why are you making it sound like I made this up and trying to get two free drinks from you?"" She said, "" M'am, again, I am just informing you I do not see it in my note."" I said, "" Can you do something about it? Talk to your manager?""
She went and spoke with her manager and later returned to say ,"" I spoke with my manager and as a courtesy we will refund your money back, however, we do not have any notes saying that we offered you drink vouchers.""

We assumed everything was going to be extremely expensive or sold out. SLS proved us wrong on both counts.

It was a mere $66 per night for Super Bowl weekend, altogether it only cost $133 minus the resort fees. I thought it was too good to be true and decided to check Yelp to see what the catch was. The mixed reviews made me a little worried.

Upon arrival everyone was very friendly and helpful during our entire stay. The person at the front desk gave us VIP admission to their club called Life. We didn't use it, but it was a nice gesture anyway. I was worried that the room was going to be tiny and uncomfortable, but my girlfriend really liked the room which was good enough for me.

If you're undecided about SLS, I say go for it. I would definitely stay there again. The only downside was that it's a little far from the strip, but if you take Sands, which turns into Spring Mountain, you'll end up in between Treasure Island and the Wynn.

After an extremely long wait in the SPG line to check-in, we were offered the room with a King bed, which we had booked, on the second floor or something with double beds on a higher floor. Again, we are SPG Gold members and had booked through them a King bed, there should have been a priority with SLS being part of the SPG family. The front desk attendant was rude, hurried and could have cared less what she gave us as long as we took something and got out of her line. 

We took the second floor King, room 217 to be exact. Do not take this room unless you want everyone using the monorail to be 30 feet from your room at all times day and night. As we walked up to our door, there was a dirty yellow drink glass sitting right outside that stayed there the entirety of our stay. Gross. 

When we walked in, we were taken aback by a couple of things. One, it was a ADA room, which was never once mentioned to us. Second, and more importantly, our window directly faced the monorail escalator with a large, dirty construction\/loading site below. The monorail was only about 30 feet from our window!  People were literally passing our room  with a full view in of us and everything in our room. As a result, we had to close the blinds and keep the shade down the entire stay for comfort and safety levels. 

In the morning, the sun came in through the ill fitting blinds and shades and was not restful at all. It was VERY loud with the construction\/loading zone below and people on the escalator.

I was not going to write this review, but seeing that the 'guest services' attendant slammed the phone in my ear when I asked to speak to a manager, just put this whole situation into bad to worse mode.

We checked in at SLS last minute after bidding on priceline as we are due to go to the Trump Towers for the rest of the week, but they had no availability for us these first two days. 

Mind you, we stayed here four weeks ago and had a great stay so we knew what to expect.

We checked in, the bell guys were amazing, dropped of our bags, got some amazing happy hour sushi at Katsuya, and then got back to the room to see what we thought was chocolate under our bed, only to uncover it was DOG POOP!!  

A further inspection of the rug, determined that it was never cleaned!  Appalled, we called downstairs, and was greeted by a nice manager who moved us to the Lux tower into a lovely suite. 

Excited, we were going to post the lovely pics of the place, UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO GO TO BED.  That is where we saw pics of the unidentified 'items' when we lifted our sheets! I wont even attempt to identify what this is, all I know is that when I called and asked to speak to a manager (it being my 2nd time) the lady on the guest services line kept asking why. Mind you, its 130am and I'm exhausted from all this move with a big conference ahead. 
So I asked more  sternly to speak to a manager and then she slams the phone in my ear. I then call back and another lady demands to know why to get to a manager (AT THIS STAGE SLS IS DEAD TO ME TO BE HONEST, WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER). 

The manager then comes on, apologizes, and says he's sending someone up.

The sad part is that this hotel has potential, but clearly they drop the ball on their staff and cleaning. I really enjoy the Beverly Hills having hosted a private event there in the summer, but this is just a horrible experience and the reason why we wont be returning here.

The rooms are gorgeous, but when u meet dog poop, and then 'unidentified items' on your sheets, and then the guest services folks are completely rude and disrespectful it spells a hotel that does not need my $$.  

What a horrible night.
This was not worth the money or time.
As a million miler and super traveler, trust me you dont want to stay here, and if you do, check your seats and also rugs when you check in.  Beverly Hills ned to overhaul this place and shut it down before it destroys their reputation. Seriously this is nothing like LA.

First off, very confusing check-in! We drove to the front of the hotel and were told to go to the back. No signs anywhere in the front explaining this. We go to the back and decide to self park because the lot is literally right next to valet and valet was very busy. We park on third floor by elevators. However, only one elevator was working so it took a very long time to catch it empty enough to get on with our bags. ( The elevator was broken the entire time we were there and according to other reviews has been that way for a long time! Too bad I didn't read the reviews first!)
We finally get inside and have to wait in along line ( of course) to check in. It is 2:30 on Friday. Only two windows are open. We get checked in with no explanation about anything, just handed us card and told us room number. We go to elevators to go up to our room. There are 8 elevators so we assume it would be fast.. We were wrong. Only two or three were working the entire time we were there! We were lucky if we could find one to get on and squeeze in whether you were going up or down. If you were going down the elevator stopped on every floor because there were always people waiting to catch one! I have never had this much trouble with an elevator. 
We get to the room and it was small but adequate and quirky. However, there was a hair on the toilet seat and hairs on bathroom floor and shower! Disgusting. The bath room is stark white so you can def notice them.
My husband goes to the gym for a quick work out. Gym small but adequate. He went to go in steam room for ten minutes after his workout and was told it would be a twenty dollar charge on top of the $30.00 resort fee we just paid! 
Also, total party hotel! Young, loud, not completely dressed patrons. They have club pool that is apparently very crowded if I were to judge by long line at security check point to get out there. We left early and came back very late Saturday. Our room was never cleaned by housekeeping! Checked out Monday and had $30 mini bar fridge charge because I stored a little bottle of cream in it.

- First, we waited an hour and 15 minutes for the hotel shuttle to pick us up at the airport. The waiting area was outside and it was only 106 degrees so it was a very pleasant wait. 

- We booked 3 rooms for our group. Two separate people called ahead to make sure that we would be able to check in before the rest of our party arrived (they booked the room), we were told it would be no problem. When we arrived, we were told we couldn't check in because the person who booked the room wasn't there. We had to call him on the phone (how would they even know it was him?) to get his confirmation that we could check in. Luckily we caught him before he got on his flight or else I guess we would have been screwed for the next 5 hours?

- Also during this frustrating check-in process, they suggested that we both put our names on the room so we could use our credit cards going forward and it would not be a problem to charge things to the room. Great. Then we went to the pool and were told our names weren't on the room so there was a whole process getting them to approve using our credit cards. 

- The pool: This is what really did it for me. They have one very small pool with limited seating that everyone can use. They also have a much larger, nicer pool, which is pictured on the website. This pool was a major selling point for the hotel because it looked really nice. Unfortunately there is a $150 minimum on Fridays and a $250 minimum on Saturdays just to use the pool... for paying hotel guests. Are you freaking kidding me? So when the rest of our party arrived, they complained and were told we could use the larger pool for free and offered $25 credit per room for the frustration (I'll come back to this later). So then we try to use the pool and guess what? The story has changed again. Now it's free for women but a cover charge for men. So basically if you pay to stay at the hotel, you are not able to use all of the amenities unless you want to pay a lot of money to go to the larger pool, in which case the amount you have to spend varies depending on who you talk to. 

- We were told there is a free shuttle that drops you off at the strip. When we were ready to go, we asked a staff member where to wait for the shuttle and were told it doesn't exist, it only goes to the airport. So then we waited in line at the check-in counter again and were told that yes it does drop you off at the strip. That's great but why are we getting such inconsistent information about everything?

- We had breakfast at one of the hotel restaurants. The food was fine, very basic breakfast food. We all ordered coffee and had several cups. It turns out the French press they bring out is $15\/pot, so we ended up spending $45 on coffee. Every single restaurant in the world offers free refills for the coffee. What a joke. 

- At check out, instead of CREDITING the rooms the previously-mentioned $25, they actually CHARGED us an extra $25. Luckily we reviewed the receipt but are you freaking kidding me?

So the amenities are expensive (obviously but it was an occasion) we got roses on the bed strawberries infused with wine and a tube of ganache and two glasses of champagne. This cost a little over $100 

The problem was that it was supposed to be in the room by 11. They called and told me they were sending it up at 10:30. Then i got a call from dining saying they mistold me the price and were going to talk to the manager ans call me back. No one called me back and i got to the room and the flowers were there, i was charged for everything, and the strawberries and champagne werent there. 

I ran downstairs and told them since my person was supposed to be on his way. They didnt get it to the room until 1:40!!
Ridiculous!

We ate at the pizza place inside. Not very good would not suggest it. We went to the pool. There arent many chairs its pretty small but nice overall. 

We gambled a bit and won a couple hundred. 

Now were having breakfast at the griddle cafe. We'll see how it goes.

What they should have done was build a new hotel from the ground up in a prime location on the strip (not slap some Phillippe Starck on an ancient turd that is about a $20+ cab ride from anything relevant). Love Starck but this hotel is lacking in space and chic. Not to mention the wheel of fortune machines are awful, you'll never get a spin. If you're looking for a great SLS hotel, go to the one in Beverly Hills or in Miami. The SLS simply got lazy with this location. The club called LiFE inside this hotel is a waste of time as well.

Stopped by on Sunday morning to check things out.  Was little surprised how dead it was for a grand opening weekend but it was 10AM in Vegas.  Lines were where you would expect them to be; Players Club desk and for the casual food.  There were no lines for the buffet but maybe the journey to find was some of that I reasoned.  I ate the buffet.  Unimpressed for $35 charge and so little selection of food.  Most of it was on the unintended cold side.  Service side was good.  I left a Vegas buffet still hungry.  

Had registered online for credit line so figured I would finish all the paperwork and do little gambling.  Credit Cashier was closed and the two Hosts told me I had to come back when it was open.  UH!  Guess you don't want me to play.  Slot selection very minimal at higher dollar values.

The front desk staff was very friendly and eager to answer any questions we had about the property including restaurant recommendations. 

This Hotel is awesome I previously read the reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor and was worried about my stay the weekend of September 26 for my husband's birthday. I change my mind quickly when provided superior service by management. The staff at the SLS are very qualified and provided excellent customer service. We were greeted by an executive host named Jae who was friendly and professional.  

We stayed at the world tower on the top floor and the room was beautiful modern and had awesome bath products. We loved the room. 

We had the opportunity to check out the 2 on site nightclubs life and the sayers club. Both were fun and played good music we even got to see a live band on Saturday night at the sayers club.

We are foodies and the food served at the hotel is so good I was surprised at the quality of the buffet and the handmade desserts. We had dinner reservations at Cleo for my husband's birthday dinner and it was top notch. 

The only thing I would say is that our room service at 3 a.m. Was not so great but if you order early enough you can get room service from any of the restaurants downstairs so it's hard to judge a pizza and sandwich at three a.m, especially when we were ready to pass out.  

Do not miss out on this hotel if you are into something more intimate and boutique and still on the strip.

SLS is at the very last Monorail stop at the far north end of the strip where the old Sahara hotel used to be. SLS definitely isn't 'ghetto'. I try to reserve that word for hotels like The Stratosphere and Circus Circus that truly are low-class, both inside and out. But let's just say the SLS is underwhelming. You can probably skip this place on your next Vegas trip.

The whole establishment gave me a really negative feeling inside. I'm not a New Ager so I don't really buy into the idea of positive and negative ""vibes"" or ""energies""... but I've gotta say, something felt off about the place. Other things just left me scratching my head.

One of the head scratchers is the hotel's theme. What's their target demographic? Who are they trying to appeal to? They had a Pancake Griddle in there with a line of senior citizens out the door. The wait time must've been two hours or more. But then adjacent to that, they're trying to promote a nightclub. I can easily envision a late evening scenario where the long lines of seniors (some with walkers, wheelchairs, etc.) who are waiting to eat at one of the restaurants gradually gets intertwined with the twenty-somethings waiting for the nightclub. Seems like that could be awkward.

The floor in one area of the hotel was covered with what appeared to be fur or hair. I suspect there were farm animals in the hotel at one point. But why?

The part that bothered me the most though was the massive, rather intimidating security presence on the casino floor. Felt like I was in Ferguson, MO. or something. I took out my iPhone to video one of the restaurants that I thought had a really interesting decor, thinking I'd post it on my Facebook -- but within seconds, one of the guards approached me and said that no photographs or videos were permitted in the hotel. The dude wasn't messing around and I'm not exactly an alpha male who's prone to challenging people, so I quietly complied and then subsequently deleted the video.

He was professional and respectful to me and went out of his way to let me know why no photos are allowed: ""because of 9\/11"". Really? Because of 9\/11? I was tempted to give him a ""What'choo' talking' 'bout, Willis?"" because every other strip location I've visited seems to have no prohibitions on videos\/photos (unless you're trying to video a card game, etc.) -- but whatever.

Anyway, I kind of feel like the SLS views all of their patrons as suspects or potential threats. I hightailed it out of there and likely won't return. The whole thing makes me realize how important it is for me to stay in my ""safe zone"": Caesars, Mirage, Aria, Cosmo, Mandalay, Fashion Show Mall, and of course my home base at MGM. People seem to like me at those places and value my business (or at least they do a good job of faking it) but man, if I stray a bit too far north, it's downright hostile! 

My recommendation is to skip SLS. So many great hotels in this town. No need to waste your time here.",43,27,13

The bad: Hotel charges an additional  $33.99 daily resort fee (when you check in is when you get informed) but we were not able to use  main hotel pool due to the pool parties they were having those days. Not even a special price to these parties for hotel guests who are paying room rates and additional resort fees.

Classless  girls picking up fights just out of the blue, (my girlfriend was insulted by some random girl in the lobby for wearing a tiara, out of the blue!!!

We partied at other hotels until the hip-hop party was over and that  crowd was gone from hotel lobby. Sad that we payed for our stay here but did not enjoy all of what hotel has to offer to avoid problems.

They actually say hello and ask how your stay is going.  Valet  took a while when I was picking up my car but it was not anything unbearable.

The whole minimalist vibe is lovely.  I love the amenities in the bathroom, all the mirrors and the 60-in Samsung tv in the bedroom.  

The casino floor is dark and has a very party atmosphere.  I can see this place catering to the 20-something LA crowd.  Their table games have lower limits than the big hotels south of here.  There are slot machines but could use a few more, like the fun aruze virtual blackjack, craps and roulette machines.  They always attract a crowd.

Tried the buffet this weekend and it was okay.  It is weird to have the buffet up the escalator and down the hall of what looks like convention rooms but I got easily distracted by all the clocks on the walls telling you what time to cuddle and chat and eat, etc.  The buffet itself is small and had limited selection.  The food servings are kept small and warm, so you see freshly prepared dishes and no crusty pans.  Nothing stands out, good or bad.  If I was staying here and the other restaurants are busy, I wouldn't mind coming to the buffet.  But I would not venture to this hotel just for the buffet.

We paid an extra 70 bucks to upgrade to a ""lux corner suite"" what we got was a cheaply decorated room with a super hard mattress, thin sandpaper sheets, cheap thin sandpaper duvet. The ac is crazy loud. The view is of a back service area. Curtains don't keep light out. No bath tub. And this is not a suite.... It's just a regular king bed. Using French themed printed curtains as wallpaper and dividers does not make the room cool. It makes it look like they cut corners, which, oh yeah... It's obvious. This is probably by far the worst ""luxury"" hotel I've stayed in. Ever. 

Not to mention, right when we checked in the room was not even cleaned! It took over half an hour of trying to get a hold of someone via phone and then going down to the lobby before the housekeeper we were able to flag down just felt bad for us and cleaned up right away. No, we were never able to get a hold of anyone to make a complaint. 

The finish and quality of this hotel just isn't there and neither is the service. Take your business elsewhere. You will be disappointed. Our friends warned us already, but given that I love the sls BH, I wanted to try it out anyway. Boo. Guess they ""already told me so.""


Update: yea I wrote this prior to check out. But here comes the sweet cherry on top of an already crappy experience. So while we were waiting for the room we had nowhere to go... Decided to grab two beers at the bar downstairs. Total, $17. We charged it to the room. Upon check out we noticed that they charged us $19 on top of the $17 beer charge as ""gratuity"".. Really? For that crappy service? Get real. Then they tried to sneak on another room charge and double charge us for the one night. Wow. And no offer to waive any fees or anything for our entire crappy experience which I did finally unload onto the front desk agent. Just dropped another star. Definitely by far the worst Vegas experience ever. Zero customer service or appreciation. Won't even be patronizing the BH location anymore.

Even asked for late check out but decided I really couldn't blow the joint quick enough. It was just too unrelaxing and flustering.",36,11,4

I noticed this Cocktail waitresses that would go around and act as if she paid for the drinks and would push people to pay her $5 each time. This isn't just per group this is per person and when you didn't pay her she says ""are you fucking kidding me!!??"". I then decided to time how long it would take till she came back....

SHE WENT THROUGH EVERY TABLE 4 TIMES. Almost 40 minutes without picking up the drinks she gave us or serving us again. I told a manager and all he did was ask her to bring him water and played it off but a second time telling him ""so do I take the drinks back? If I do will I get paid?"". That's when he flagged her to come...

Three of the four of my friends was playing but once she came she said ""I can't give one of you guys a drink because you're not playing"" and that's when it pushed me.. I told her ""well YOU HAVEN'T CAME BACK IN THE PAST HOUR SO DUH WE TOOK A BREAK"". After I attempted to show her how I timed her and her face turned white and that's when she said ""I'm not going to serve you guys""... But wait you haven't so what are we missing here? Lol. 

A side note for all the new comers, I only noticed her doing this but pretty much she would hide any small tip and leave the bigger ones to make people feel pressured to tip and if they didn't they didn't get a drink. She was the owner of these tables and no Manager or Boss could say anything. 

To have a good business it starts with the staff that runs it and having a great time in the past few days to have this one horrible person ruin it made me hate the place. I assumed some staff member would step in and help us out but they didn't so all hope left.",2,0,2

We went in for the breakfast place, trying to compete with the Hash House a Gogo..  it didn't, and now it's done. But, in it's place, the SLS opened the Northside Cafe. It more than adequately fills the bill for a breakfast. They kept the French Press Coffee and that is great. But, let's focus on the over all big picture.  

I grew up in Vegas. Used to go to the Sahara for the Greek Festival for years, even played in the lounges as a working musician and saw BB King and Pete Barbutti in the showroom, so I have more than a little experience in the old property. Believe me, it evolved into a dump. Probably getting some Stratosphere cuddies on it..   well, it is 100% gone.   

The SLS team did a great job, grabbing some of the heritage of the Sahara and incorporating it into a great place to stay and play..  or just stay while you venture into Vegas. I'm not a gambler, I attend trade shows. The SLS will be my home for 4 events a year, into the foreseeable future.  

Pros: The staff is happy, and ""can do"". The place seems to have an aroma therapist from the minute you roll into the valet, through the hallways to the rooms and elevators. The decor is fun. Look down at the carpets with the throwback pics of Vegas and the Sahara and the video wall behind the desk.  It is very well done.  The food is great. I have enjoyed the Burger place, the Beer Garden (love the truffle fries), the pizza restaurant (anchovies PLEASE - Great), the Japanese noodle place and of course the Northside Cafe for breakfast every day. 

Cons: Very few and it's not really a Yelp comment, but the FedEx office inside the SLS is horrible. Received packages on a Monday, called the hotel operator (on hold) called the Valet (on hold) etc, etc..   and NEVER could find the boxes. Turns out they were in the FedEx office (not part of the hotel) when I finally found them. I was told it was $250 to bring them to valet or $125 if I came and got them. When I asked, why there were no light on my room phone that the boxes had been received, I was told, ""we are a separate business, not part of the hotel"".  

So I left my colleagues at breakfast to schlep boxes and $125. later had purchased a dolly and move them all to the valet. Oh, and they were nice enough to charge it to my room. Interesting they could ""charge my room"" with their terminal in the FedEx office (a separate business) but, couldn't acknowledge that the packages were received on the property. Lesson?? Don't ship trade show materials to the hotel. Just have a breakfast.  

I am going back and have booked my room through 2017 for several shows. Looking forward to it and that French Press coffee..",3,2,2

We became bigger fans of this hotel the longer we stayed. The biggest positives are the restaurants, the smaller size which was less taxing on the legs compared to the larger resorts, and the bed which my wife couldn't rave about more.

Parking and check in were a breeze. We stayed in the World Tower which, as with the rest of the towers, you cannot enter the elevator lobby or elevators without a room key. The rooms fit their purpose with as mentioned before, the beds being super comfortable. The large Samsung flat screen with crystal clear picture was a bonus. The rooms are on the smaller side, but we're not looking to shag fly balls in there.

We enjoyed the restaurants we visited and we didn't even eat at Bazaar Meat, Katsuya, or Cleo. I'm a big fan of Umami and could hang out there any time. My wife chilled out at the pool on Tuesday waiting for me to get off work and said she was able to relax and enjoy the sun. If you're local and want to leave the hotel without driving, you can buy a round trip ticket on the monorail for $2.

The casino wasn't too crowded and I did well with my play. Which will probably get us another offer to stay which we would gladly accept. If I didn't get a comp, I would stay here again if the rate was right. In the end, I think this is good hotel for the guest that wants to eat well, maybe hit a club, or want to gamble in a non mega casino\/resort.",1,0,0

Stale smoke which will never go away. Checking in was fast and I just had to give my credit card for a deposit that you get back at checkout.

Anyway we went to umami burger \/ sports book for dinner. I'm not really sure what they are trying to do here but there was only two beef patty burgers on the menu the rest were other burgers . For example Ahi tuna burger. Wtf no thank you. Beer selection was supposed to be rare and amazing I wasn't impressed. The second night was better we went to Monkey bar I had a espresso martini for the first time ever and it was really good. Our bartender jewel was very nice and she always made sure we were ok. Then we went to the sayer room for drop the mic night. It was a lip sync contest with celebrity stars or used to be stars. Robin leech, Adrain zamed, pezadora I don't think I spelled that right.

We new it would be clean since it had only been open for a few months since the rehab from the old Sahara decor.     Upon entering I did not recognize any of the old remnants or design of the previous inhabitants.

The Front desk staff were dressed sharp with suits and ties and were also friendly, courteous and helpful.  It took a moment to find the reservation because I booked it just a few hours prior but they accommodated quickly.  The clerk gave  us directions and we were on our way to the 23rd floor.  Woo Hoo!

Everything here at SLS is completely unrecognizable from the old Sahara.  This place seems to be catering to the young and hip crowd based on its sleek and modern decor in the elevators and halls.  The same applied to the rooms which were clean and well kept and have not been completely destroyed quite yet from the illicit activities that happen withing these walls after midnight.  

The hotel was busy because of the long holiday weekend and there was live music being played in the front entrance which was cool.  We played a little on the machines and we even had a visit from the cocktail waitress who was friendly and prompt with delivering our beverages.  A++

Another plus about the SLS is the many different dining options that they have on site including a coffee bar, pizza restaurant, 24 hour cafe, fine dining options and even a steak and sushi place.  They have something for everyone and every budget. 

Overall a great staycation thanks SLS for making it a good evening.  The price was a little high for my like but I understand its because of Valentine's and President's day weekend.",4,1,6

I have never been to this hotel (or the Sahara) so this was a new experience for us.  Overall, there were some good and some so-so.  We normally stay more central on the strip at Cosmo or Palazzo.  I probably wouldn't stay here again unless it was comped and there were no other options.
Location\/Vibe\/Hotel:  LIke I mentioned, its all the way at the end of the strip (past Circus Circus).  Not really walking distance to anything.  The only good thing about the location was that it was right across the street from Rocking Rio.  Because you avoid the main strip, cab ride to\/from airport will cost you about $20.  I describe the vibe as a poor man's Cosmopolitan.  It is on the hip\/trendy side.  Way smaller and more intimate.  I like the fact that there are 2 entrances (front and back).  We always used the back cuz there were no lines for cab...plus a quicker way to get out.  The hotel's casino is pretty darn small.  But with that said, fewer players so lower minimums.  Most of the time I could find a table of blackjack for myself.  
Checkin:  Was on the tad slow.  The front desk is not huge and the line always seemed long.  You do need a hotel card to enter the elevator and they are pretty strict on that.  
Rooms:  There were about 6 or so elevators and wait time wasn't too long.  But if it gets crowded, it could take a while to get to your top floor.  Our room was 31520 (but on the 15th floor??? I don't get it) and was really close to the elevator.  The room is tiny.  So tiny that it cannot fit a rollaway bed due to it being a fire hazard.  The room has a nice modern decor with ample lighting.  The beds are doubles and not queens.  Bathroom was decent.  The sink was modern and very shallow.  There was no tub but nice shower with good water pressure. My biggest issue with the room was that you can hear all kinds of music from downstairs...starting at 8am.  I don't think it was only the concerts fault.  Music was coming from the pool area I think.  Very loud and noisy.  Made it very difficult to sleep in.  TV was massive and had good amount of channels.  There was no coffee offered (a trend in vegas hotels) but a good size bar.  Beds were comfy.  There were ample plugs in the room to charge things. Wifi was spotty and not the fastest.
Amenities:  Not a lot of restaurants to choose from.  Only 1 diner option for breakfast.  No buffet.  The pool area was nice.  We paid for a cabana at the Foxtail Pool.  IT was not terribly crowded and a decent scene.  There were 3 blackjack tables there as well.  I didn't get a chance to check out the fitness area.

If that were true, why was I contacting the front desk again only to be told that it was ""part of the decor"".  Really?   Because it really looked like crap.  Red stains are part of the decor?

Might not be for everybody but I like it. It has the correct size although the breakfast place is way to small for the amount of people staying here. 
A couple of things we definitely did not like. Rooms are small which is OK. They're super modern but we missed a closet with doors and the room had no drawers whatsoever. I'm not really keen to present my underwear in ""public"". Drawers are a must. 
The entire place including lobby has carpet. Not only that the carpet gets dirty very quick it is also a pain in the buns to drag your suitcase over the carpet.

Being a LA resident I am very familiar with the whole SBE portfolio and do frequent them. They do know the restaurant\/club scene well and Hyde @ Bellagio is one of the best clubs in Vegas. It appeared that SLS is geared more towards tourists and forgot about the locals when they missed the mark on both...a real disconnect in the brand and what my experience was. Style Luxury & Service were 3 things I did NOT experience.

This review is based on my visit to the hotel\/casino and nightclubs.

-immediate descriptors would be...gloomy sad wannabe pretentious

-no real signage or direction as to where things are on the property. Like cattle all being herded. No sign of people working, greeting, or that it was even a grand opening.

-possibly one of the BIGGEST problems with this casino floor is the exposed black ceiling with HVAC and duct work showing. You spend half a BILLION $ and can't afford to build a proper ceiling with actual lighting [dark as hell]. About as warm and welcoming as a Costco or Best Buy

-after walking around in circles trying to find the clubs I noticed it was a very claustrophobic and chaotic layout. I don't mind a small casino area like the original Hard Rock which I feel they were kind of going for with the middle bar but there was no flow to the layout whatsoever. Machines and tables too close to one another and the restaurants and lines for them creeping into the gaming floor leaves no room to breathe and take in the space. 

-the middle bar looked good and had a fresh design to it. Looks like they spent all their money on the led screen on top....SBE obviously spent money on some high tech stuff but chinced on a lot of really small things that were noticeable. Carpeting was a definite miss and there's too much random crap everywhere that comes across cheap and trying to appear ""expensive"" ..see some of the hotel room review for more of that.

-since I work in the architecture and design field I did notice some nice decor features but I've never really been a fan of Starck. Very pretentious and trying way too hard to be artistic and different ....more of ""smoke n mirrors"" literally. It's as if they were going for the Cosmopolitan type look and clientele but didn't have the budget to do it proper.

-one other note regarding the clientele. I'm not really sure who they're marketing to. LA people like myself who frequent SBE restaurants and nightclubs as well as the SLS in LA don't come to Vegas to go to all the same places that are down the st in LA.  Makes no sense. Should have offered some fresh options instead of all the places that SBE own. 

-Foxtail...door guy and management @ Foxtail were really friendly and let us right in no problem as we knew people that worked there...great bartenders and staff as well.  Foxtail decor was more of the dark gloomy colors with the custom graphics all over...the whole graphic and graffiti and bird cages came across as confusing and trying too hard once again. Not sure why the pool patio part of the club wasn't open. Def the best part of the venue...snuck out there and took a pic. 

- Went to Sayers next....nice venue...small..good band...weird patio overlooking Sahara if I can remember correctly. Nice bartenders

- At the roped off line at Life with no one else in line on opening weekend..they try charging the local female VIP concierge I'm with $65 to get in when she is checking out the venue to bring customers there.  We ended up walking away. Stopped by the next night and was on the list with friends who had a table....door guys makes us wait and walked away agin. 20 min later tell us we""re not on the list even though we are. They walk away and just ignore you. The LIFE door is not friendly and pretty much sending paying customers away. Will not return there neither will the host or her clients. Your not XS or Drais....lose the attitude

-gambled a bit. Friendly dealers. Hard to get a drink while playing slots. A bit of a random crowd throughout the floor. Lighting needs a lot of help.

-Left SLS through an exit door only to be spit out on right on the sidewalk on Sahara next to a bunch of bums and almost on the street. Totally unsafe and impossible to get a cab. Terrible end to sub par experience.

 I wanted to like the SLS Vegas but there really wasn't anything worth spending my money on that I couldn't get better in a nicer area on the strip. About the hotel rooms..I've stayed at all their competitor hotels in Vegas and judging by the reviews, photos, and room rates.. the prices here are way too high. Not sure why there's all these cleanliness issues also with rooms and the property? It's not even a month old? 

Prices will have to come down to compete with anything other than 3 star and under properties and the staff will need a lot of work.

Turns out my prediction was pretty accurate.  I don't know how to feel about that.

I drove by the SLS on the night it opened, so I got to see the big fireworks show.  It felt like another part of Vegas' ever changing history on the Strip.  But I didn't go into the place until a few days later.

Yay for not tearing down the old place  Save SOME old Vegas history, right?  I did see one nice throwback of a chandelier being installed that was made up of the Sahara ""S"" door handles, which is far in the back.  The casino is easy to navigate, as it's still by and large the Sahara floorplan.  They have some neat statues like the ""rubber duckie"" by the pool and the amoeba creature by the front end.  The staff was nice.  I suppose one days I'll end up in one of the eateries, though friend comments have made me wary thus far.

But that's kind of it, and that's the problem: There's nothing really stand out about the place.  Oh sure, it's all modern ""ultra hip"", but it's nothing that I haven't seen before.  The place looks and feels like any other dozen-plus ""boutique"" experiences that I've been to a million times over, and I was kind of worried that would happen.  The place just lacks any real sense of personality.  If you need high-end shops, they've got you covered, but where's the ""vibe""?  The uniqueness?

And of all the things they would keep from the Sahara, they kept those terrible, rickety elevators of the parking garage.

Personally, I would have been happy if they had just given the Sahara a much-needed makeover, and rebranded it as ""The NEW Sahara"".  ""SLS"" is just an awkward name that doesn't sound good no matter how many times you say it.

It looked like some places were still being worked on.  There was no direct access to where the old NASCAR area used to be, so hopefully something is going on over there that will help to change my mind on the place.  Whatever happened to the second floor where the buffet used to be?

Don't get me wrong: The new designs are pleasant enough and the casino is okay, but it's nothing that I haven't done so many times before.  I wanted to go in there feeling impressed and won over, not jaded and underwhelmed.  I hope they figure out what to do with themselves soon, because the revamp\/rebrand doesn't really seem to justify itself as much as it should.",8,2,3

Was this place the same as the SLS in Beverly Hills?  Apparently not, judging by all of the trucker hats and d-bags with their exposed boxers and jeans hanging low to the ground.  

The check-in area felt disorderly, not what you should expect from a property with the SLS trademark.  After we checked in and got away from the crowds, the rooms were pretty nice.  I loved the all-white decor and wished this decor extended to the common areas which were rather very dark.  The exposed pipes in the ceiling above the casino made it feel like I was walking into someone's basement.  

You could tell that the SLS Las Vegas was trying really really hard to bring LA to the Vegas Strip - somehow something got lost in translation.  The Vegas counterparts all seemed like a knock-off of the LA originals like Katsuya and The Bazaar.",12,2,3

1. Disordered system. We booked online, and they can not find our reservation in their system. So they rebooked one night for us without any notification! If I didn't pay attention to my email, we would have paid twice for the same room!! That's really unacceptable.

2. Bad attitude. Both check-in and check-out took us more than 20min. And they don't want to be responsible for what they have done to us as listed in 1. 

3. No bath tub. It's so wired, but they don't have bath tub in the whole hotel.

4. No maintenance. We spent two nights there and there was no cleaning after the first night for no reason!

5. Stupid sensor. They have things available in the fridge and above the fridge. If you have ever touched them, they may charge you even if you didn't consume them at all. So pay attention to the resort fee when you check out!!

Around a $14 cab ride to the Bellagio and ~$18 from the airport. I could see the stratosphere outside my window and even that was closer to the strip  versus SLS. 

Rooms are teeny weenie! Literally two FULL beds (not queen or king size), a tv, mini bar and desk, with a medium sized bathroom. It reminded me more of a studio rather than a hotel room. Everything is nice and modern with mirrors everywhere! They even light up and resemble huge makeup mirrors. 

Gym is puny and closes at 8PM! Cardio machines, a few free weights, and weight machines. Definitely not as nice as the ones I've seen at other hotels. Paying $28 in resort fees is absurd too! That gym should be free to use! 

Once you walk outside the doors you're surrounded by the ghetto of Vegas. People handing out stripper adds and indigents galore so you may want to play it safe and take a cab or the monorail.

Only good thing about this place are the restaurants! They have UMAMI BURGER!!! My favorite!! Along with many other places to chose from.",6,4,1

It looks like they kept some of the old Sahara property...the hotel tower, I think, and re-built a lot of the other pieces.  It's very much a boutique property, and is much smaller than the mini-cities that Vegas has become known for.  This is neither good nor bad, just the way it is.  The style is pretty trendy and the place definitely seems to attract a pretty young crowd.  The room rates, at this point, are very good, since they only opened a few months back.  They have a few different room options, varying in size and style  I'd check the website for photos, as the styling is probably not for everyone.  

The room I had was about 380 square feet, or so, which is a bit on the small side when considering a lot of properties in Vegas these days.  It was perfectly adequate, though, and had a decent bathroom, small foyer area, and main room.  The bed was very comfortable, on the medium side, which works well for me.  It's platform-style, so a bit lower than your traditional hotel bed.  The room had a nice 55"" HDTV, two huge mirrors on each side of the room that were framed in accent lighting, that was kinda cool.  The desk and desk chair were a joke, and definitely not great for the business traveler.  The chair was something you'd find in an Ikea cafeteria (seriously) and was not at all good for extended use.  The desk had an odd framed piece of art that was affixed to the top of the desk in a off-center\/skewed manner, which made using the desk a little strange.  On the positive side, there is a small couch and side chair that were both pretty comfortable, despite the fact that they were covered in a vinyl material.  The windows are not floor-to-ceiling in the old tower I was in, though I think they are in the ""Lux"" tower, which appears to be new.  The window is half-height, with venetian blinds and a blackout shade.  I had no great view, other than being on a high floor, it was an empty lot, really.  The windows also have some kind of screening affixed to the outside of the window, which makes looking through them when close to the window kinda hard.  

The room had a mini-fridge, but no ice maker.  As hotels have started to do, everything in the mini-bar, and the vending trays on top, are sensor-inventoried, so removing anything for more than 60 seconds will charge it to your room.  It's the usual story of $5 pepsi, $7 Red Bull, and $14 nuts.  They actually have a sign in the fridge that states any storage of personal items will result in a $30 ""re-stocking"" fee.  Not sure what they'd need to re-stock if you haven't used any of the items the hotel puts in the fridge, but whatever.  What I can recommend is that you purchase the same items they have (pepsi, Red Bull, Evian, etc.) and simply swap out a cold one for one you bought...this way you don't incur any charges, and can use the fridge to cool your beverages.  They do not provide a coffee maker in the room I had, even though there was plenty of room for one.  They have a coffee shot downstairs, so you'll have to deal with the $6 lattes there.  

The resort fee is $25\/day, and covers Wi-Fi, Gym, local calls, and I think the pool when it's open.  This is now standard, so I won't go on the usual rant.  I can say that the WiFi was OK for me, with speeds ranging from 75Mbps to over 200Mbps download, and somewhat slower uploads.  Can't say it's worth $25\/day, but at least it's not slow.  It's totally unsecured, so I'd not recommend doing anything too sensitive.

I did not try any of the restaurants, but other reviewers seem to like them.  The parking was easy, and there's a monorail stop (the end of the line) on premises, which makes for a convenient transportation option.  This property is located on the north end of the strip, and is essentially the next-to-last property, with the Stratosphere located at the very north end of the strip.  This part of the strip is a little dead, so you'll probably want to take the monorail a stop or two south, as that's where the action really starts.  

Overall, it's a decent property, and if you can get a good deal, it's a reasonable bargain.  If you're looking for a very large resort-style setting, this is probably not the best option for you, however if you're looking for a hotel that's just off the main part of the strip, and doesn't require a mile walk to your car, I'd take a look.",5,0,2

This place isn't doing enough business and they want to appeal to locals and yet some idiot has hip hop and electronic music for the most part pounding into our heads while we are trying to enjoy gambling and talking.

Red Rock does the same thing and it's even dumber because they have a great majority of seniors there most of the time.

I used Priceline and did their blind booking thing, where they give you the amenities and a price, but not the hotel's identity. The price was right, the location claimed to be ""on the strip"", and the amenities all looked promising. I booked, and then found I was staying at the SLS. I google'd the site, looked pretty cool, exciting, and trendy...then I came to Yelp.

There was no middle ground, either you'd love it or you'd hate it. It was, however, a new hotel, so there was hope that they were just working out the kinks. Either way, it was too late, the money was spent. Off I went.

The good:

The hotel was cool looking. I personally enjoyed the eclectic and LA-like style of the SLS. It felt trendy and cool, had just enough space, and there was always something to look at. No view from the room I had, but hey, wasn't really there to look out the window, so no big deal. The pool was very cool, with ambient music to chill too, and with the weather being what it was - fantastic - I had no complaints. The casino, granted, was smaller than others, but it obviously got the job done...people were winning and losing money. Food-wise, the Griddle Cafe was amazing and Ku Noodle had awesome dim sum. Location-wise, it was at the very top of the strip, so you've got a trek south, but it IS right at the end of the monorail, so if you purchase a 3 day pass you can come and go as you please and take a relatively short ride down to the main parts of the strip.

Now the bad:

The hotel neglected to mention the charges they put on my card: $600 for incidentals, which, when I complained about it when it showed up on my card  they refunded $450 of it...but then followed by charging another $193.40 and $144.20 on subsequent days. This seems to be a going issue across the board. Make sure you know what you're being charged and why (if you're not balling, of course). Everything is grossly overpriced, of course it's Vegas so that's to be expected, but you know, go in expecting worse case scenario in terms of cost of everything from bottled water to random purchases.


Overall:

The food was excellent, great places to eat, the people overall were friendly, the location was thankfully next to the monorail, so if you get the 3 day pass, you'll have no problem getting where you need to go. Aside from the issues with the charges, I loved the place and had a great time. Now...if they'll just give me back the other ""incidental charges""...",2,0,0

Overall this place deserves one star.",11,10,2

I had to call them twice, once for a wrong charge and the second for more towels. Each time the problem got resolved and customer service called me back to make sure I received the towels I requested. The rooms are nice and I have no clue why everyone is complaining. The closet area has shelves where we used to hang and place our clothes. We also requested more hangers and they sent more up. They are at the very end of the strip but we purchased monorail tickets that took up to the MGM. When we did take a taxi we only paid $12-$15 to get to other locations. Be weary of some of the cab drivers. One of our drivers took us off the strip and around the way, just to get back on the strip. Out fare ended up being $22, the most we ever spent. 

We also got a pleasant surprise while there. We kept seeing a lot of camera men walking around and finally got stuck on the elevator with one. After questioning him about the tons of camera men he finally told us that they were filming top model. We also saw one of the models but no Tyra Banks :(

Pros:
-Lots of great food options
-Lots of room options - Lux Tower (most high-end\/posh), World Tower (feels like a Hilton\/Marriot), and Story Tower (""hipster"")
-Friendly staff 
-SBE Code discounts (just have to sign up)
-GREAT price, even without the SBE Code discount
-Free valet

Cons:
-No late night room service on weekdays
-Gym closes at 8PM
-FAR north end of the strip - past Circus Circus. You are going to be taking a lot of cabs.  If you are here for business or a convention, this is obviously much less of a problem. 

Steady Improvements
-Check-in\/Check-out times
-Parking\/Valet (free!)

We had pizza at 800degrees it's really oily and good !

Style - None. Our room has no window. The ceiling is left unfinished. Because of these features, the room has the feel of a claustrophobic prison cell. No style. 

Walking through the gaming area fails to give me a theme. It has pictures and paintings of chimpanzees dressed as noblemen, women with horse heads, rubber ducky with sun glasses, etc. Maybe I am influenced by the likes of Venetian, Paris Las Vegas, etc. Encore & Wynn casinos have consistent styles of decorations. 

Luxury - The head board of our bed is plasticky & cheesy. It looks cheap. The wash sink is behind the head board of the bed. There is no closet, just a frame to hang clothes up. While high prices do not equate to luxury, the decor and furnishings of the windowless room fail to convey luxury.

Not only is the room small, but it has an interesting layout.  There is not much space to store your clothes.  As for the small refrigerator, it is useless.  It is completely packed with their stuffs leaving you no room to store any of your stuffs.  There is also mirror above the bed.  Kinky!!  As for the services, it is quite lacking.

*VIP Host Mike Rubin was phenomenal. He went above and beyond to make my bachelorette party of 9 girls memorable.
*the hotel and rooms were gorgeous
*food selections were great
*salon was fantastic. My cousins makeup turned out great.

Unfortunately the negatives would out weigh the positives and I will never stay here again:

*i reserved 3 rooms in February and they were requested to be 2 conjoined and one in close proximity. I called 2 days prior to our stay confirm this was available and was told yes. We check in and the front desk girl said,""I see your rooms are pre-assigned"" and continued to say that only the king was available for the time being! PERFECT! I said cause we want to decorate it. 30 mins later after decorating I check my cell phone and I have 2 missed calls from the front desk stating there was a HUGE computer glitch and the conjoined room was not available. We went to the front desk to see what can be changed because we had just decorated!!!! After spending another 30 mins at the front desk the supervisor was rude and non accommodating. He did however give us a whopping $50 food and bev credit! So we had to pack up all of our belongings and move to another floor and redecorate.

* now we had a great time at the pool. But I forgot we had the food credit and charged it to my CC. I happened to go to the front desk to ask about some other charges on our rooms. That gentleman reminded me that I had the credit and since we just left the pool we should ask them to reverse the charge and add it to the room. While I was finishing up at the front desk I sent my friend with the receipt and CC to the pool. The manager took the transaction and made her wait for 15 mins before he came back with a disappointing no! Very rude man.

On our first visit it was a rainy Friday night and we wanted to stop in for a quick bite and explore the property. Walking in we immediately noticed that it was dead and on a Friday night?!?!? It was very sad to see because the property has come a very long way from its roots. 

The colors work well and the gaming floor is small with nice shiny new machines and tables. There are many whimsical furniture pieces and art throughout and we enjoyed walking around looking into all the shops and checking out the restaurant choices. This evening we wanted something quick so we chose The Griddle Cafe as it had a fun and very extensive menu. The overall experience there was a tad off as that evening they were switching ownership, separate review on the restaurant. 

Like I said it was very sad to see how dead it was in this place and I told my man we should check out all the restaurants before the property closes. We didn't sleep over so I can't comment on the rooms.

They promised a Umami burger and griddle cafe (which is no longer there), for a young man in his early 20's this meant convenience until i found out where it's location would be. Put off and so I put it off for a couple years. 

Fast forward to 2016, the mark up on Valentines Day\/Presidents weekend was ridiculous, I found myself kind of forced to go to Vegas and was struggling to find a fair priced room. After continuous searches I came across the year of the monkey promotion at the SLS. Shout out to curious george, the price was more than reasonable (about 50% off their standard rate for that weekend +5o$ credit for food and beverage) and so I decided to make this my home for a couple nights.

Check-in\/Check-out

The gentleman that helped me check-in was not the most personable person in the city, he had the service skills of someone that should be working at the palace station. But at least he was properly trained on how to check in and hand guest their keys. The young lady checking me out did better, buuuut also lacked more smiles.

Overall Service

75% of the employees here are amazingly friendly! I cannot remember one sour face in the casino, the dealers made you feel comfortable regardless of whether or not you were wearing hangover clothes at the table. There were some rotten apples in the bunch as you would expect at a hotel with so many employees, but none that made my stay unpleasant.

THE GUILLERMO EXPERIENCE

I had a gentleman show up to my room to clean up a glass that broke (it wasn't my fault I promise) and he was very nice, funny and a hard worker! He made sure to go through proper protocol when cleaning the glass up. He swept, vacuumed and mopped and then called me over to ask me if it looked good. Guillermo you're the man!

The Rooms

I booked two rooms in the world tower with opposite views. One was of the stratosphere and the other of a construction zone. I guess that leaves us even, knowing I used a promotional rate I wasn't expecting the penthouse view. The rooms themselves are small but big enough if you're keeping it to 2 per room, I'd imagine 4 people in one of those to be claustrophobic but thankfully I did not get to experience that myself. The mirrors light up and provide enough light to emulate day time 24\/7. The bathrooms were good, the products were in bigger than average containers, which made me not have to worry about squeezing out too much. Decent rooms.

The Casino

Very small and missing the high roller Vegas feel that many come to Vegas for. But okay for quick play. 

Amenities 

Their restaurant line up has a 3-5 star offering in every price range. They have a gift shop and a couple boutique stores. Not bad for not being the center of attention. Their pool was open but I did not check it out. I'd say they have something to satisfy your needs to a certain degree. There is also a walgreens right across the street which I visited over 5 times? 

Security

They check the keys, even though it's just a flash and anyone with an unvalid key could walk by and tag along with someone it's nice to have. I didn't have any issues with them and I did not see them having any issues with anyone. It's safe (no pun intended) to say it was a calm weekend in there.

Valet

Valet was could be improved. They do take a while to bring you your vehicle, so maybe call ahead of time. The service was alright, except for one driver who came running to assist us when they were in the middle of a rush, so proactive! I wish I would of gotten their name. 

The Bad

Aside from the valet here are some of the things my mind compiled. The smell when you first walk in is a migraine starter, but somehow you manage to get used to it within the first minute though. As many have said, what's the theme? It has very unusual aesthetics and the decor can at times come off as trying too hard to be chic. What's up with the interior of the elevators? The hallways are very boring on the floors to your room. Despite the rooms being lit up, most of the hotel is darker than I would have liked. There's a dryness in the overall vibe of the hotel, that has no relation to the staff.

Should you stay? 

In emergency situations and when there is no other alternative, yes. The hotel really is not a mess as long as you get a clean room and respected by the staff. But I'd suggest working overtime or selling a couple things on ebay leading up to your trip so you can drop 50$-75$ more to stay elsewhere. The confusion lies within the desire to make this a boutique like hotel and the fact that its location really handicaps their potential. If hotels start opening up in the northern part of the strip though, I'd really like to see this hotel flourish. I am also curious to see how it all works out when the W opens up adjacent to them this year. For now I will keep my nights some where else but nevertheless I will keep my eye on their growth.",12,7,8

Blinds filthy and they don't have a mini fridge for your own food or beverages (which all other hotels have and I needed for my babies food) and they don't have coffee makers in the rooms either, which was also a big down fall because you have to go downstairs to get hot water (for bottles) and pay for basic coffee. The staff we dealt with in person were good. But over the phone very unprofessional.

And i know they're going to be working on some kinks. But I've stayed at many hotels in Vegas, and I've never experienced so many things go wrong with my trip. 

(and for the person who wrote that anyone giving this hotel less than 3 stars was bitter about losing money - that is NOT true. I won lots of money, and am STILL left with a bitter taste in my mouth)

Here are some of the things that happened:

1) first room they gave us smelled like sewers. Even the bell man bringing up the luggage mentioned it. The hotel was quick about changing the room to another one. 

2) I asked for a non-smoking floor. The hallway of the whole floor was filled with cigarette smoke and there was even a report filed by security for it. I called the front desk and asked for a humidifier for my room. I was told (5 times) that the hotel didn't have humidifiers, which I could not believe because all the hotels I've stayed at on the strip have humidifiers. I was told there was nothing the hotel can do for me. 

3) After 24 hours of not being able to breathe, I complained again for a humidifier. This time, the person said they had them. Seriously?!

4) I called up for towels at 7:15 pm. After 2 follow-up calls and 3.5 hours later, the towels had still not arrived. I called again, and the person pretended like I had JUST put in the order. I had to have them listen to the conversation from 3 hours before to make them realize that I had asked for it earlier. 3.5 hours for towels? Seriously?!

5) Had dinner at Cleo for a birthday. I not only told the person at the front of the restaurant to surprise the bday girl with dessert, but I whispered it to the waiter as well and told him it was a surprise. Not only did the waiter ruin the surprise, but he brought the bill without bringing the dessert.  ---- This wasn't even the biggest issue at dinner. Not only did the waiter take my food away (which was only half-eaten) without asking me if I was done, but there was an extremely moldy berry in my friend's drink.  

6) TV wasn't working for a few hours. Which was rather annoying.


I do have one positive thing to say - the employees were nice. But other than that, there is some MAJOR miscommunication among the staff of this hotel. The employees obviously are not well-trained yet. I really hope the hotel gets its act together because it is a shame to see it not do well.

Anna at front desk was a doll. She was the best part of the trip. Thanks Anna!",6,1,0

Having been familiar with the SLS brand in LA, the bar was set high for SLS Las Vegas.  

We booked our evening the second day of business.  With reasonable expectations of the property not running perfectly, we aimed to just explore\/enjoy the property for 24 hours.

FIRST IMPRESSION:
Upon entering the driveway, we approached the valet person blocking the main entrance circle  -- we told him that we were checking in.  He told us to park in the garage. There was no way I was going to rough it and drag good luggage (100+ degrees) through the old Sahara parking lot and deal with Sahara faulty elevators.  So, we circled around again and noticed other people driving right up to the front entrance and unloading.  Gee, was a Range Rover not front entrance worthy?  I pulled in hot. Upon reaching the main entrance, valet unloaded and parked our car.  TIP: If you are unloading at the front entrance, you need to have the bellman take your bags, otherwise you will drag your bags across carpeted floors with heavy flows of people (assuming SLS survives) as the checkin desk is on the other side of the property. Also take a photo of your bags on the bellman cart.  The lack of organization makes you wonder if all your belongings will actually ever make it to your room.

ONE STAR:
The one star is for bringing back the bright white entrance that actually makes you feel like you are on vacation for a hot minute.  The allure lasts about five steps though .  You walk on to this cool illuminated surface then step down into a casual ""Cannery"" casino atmosphere. By the time I took my first step onto the dreadful casino floor, I said ""wow, this is not what I was expecting"".  This isn't a place where you style your best threads.  The exposed ceiling really diminishes any possibility of sophistication.  Additionally the lighting designers missed the mark -- it is depressingly too dark. Seriously it feels like you are under ground.  The restaurants are pockets off the casino floor -- meaning you are exposed to the smoke and noise.  The 24 hour restaurant should have been twice the size -- like other resorts.  TIP: Use OpenTable for reservations and pray they get you in on time and pay attention to notes. Stressful.

CHECK IN
The checkin desk is in the same location as the original Sahara, however, it is unmarked and has no line organization or hotel ambassador.  You have to be on the watch to make sure someone doesn't just walk up to an open attendant, while you are waiting 20 mins or longer to check in. Stressful.

THE ROOM
Old Sahara small, interesting approach but sadly sterile feeling.  Glass shower exposed to the main room is passe' and cheesy.  Really, like anyone is going to get sexy at the  Cannery, I mean SLS?  Can't you just present a tasteful room where you don't have to wonder if an orgy took place the night before?  

We did know that housekeeping was there as cleaning agent bottles were showcased on the desk and snacks and liquor were missing from the mini bar.  Speaking of snacks, we wondered about room service offerings.  No menu.  Shortly after* someone did leave two sheets of paper STAPLED together in our ""lux-high floor"" room.  *The ""shortly after"" involved me going to the front desk to report the missing items and inquire about room service, because NOBODY answers the phone in any department. TIP:  Take photos of your mini bar and room.

FOOD: UMAMU BURGER
My friend was dying to try Umami Burger.  He ordered a burger that is to come with a beer cheese sauce.  BUT he asked for the beer cheese on the side because he wanted to make sure that he liked it.  The server returned to our table and said ""the kitchen won't serve you the beer cheese on side because it melts when placed on the burger"". As a chef myself, I said, ""soooooo can't the kitchen heat a ceramic ramekin and put the cheese in it?  ""NO"", said the waiter.  Since this can't be done, I will assume they serve plastic cheese.  They also just lost a customer.  Truthfully, the burger was no different that any burger you can get on the strip.  TIP:  If you want a good burger in Vegas, go to BLT at the Mirage. Fabulous.

We checked out of this resort after the UMAMI burger meal.  

BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!
Unless you know the secret valet recovery location (tucked away in a place you would think only employees are permitted) you will never get your car back.  If you are handicap, too bad.  You are on your own because valet doesn't answer the phone either.

NO HOUSE PHONES
If your cell phone is low, CHARGE IT.  I was told by an engineer that no house phones have been installed yet.

You know what, I'm not going to waste any more of your time waxing poetic about this hotel's pros and cons. Here is the bottom line - the basic room is sexy.

The location is completely removed from the strip and far away from everything happening. The hotel is very small and is very out dated - it is clear this hotel is not ""new"". The wall paper on the walls are peeling, the rooms mainly face parking lots and the walls are paper thin. We got a room on a non smoking floor and there was cigarette smoke on the entire floor, we called security but nothing seemed to happen. They are understaffed, if you call the front desk for ANYTHING you have to hold for a good 5-10 minutes (this happened a few times). 

My husband gambled a lot of his players card but when it came to check out - they casino host ""couldn't find the amounts"" so they were not accounted for, he said he can check the cameras but that would take a week, as if we were staying there for a week and were going to patiently wait, seems like a scam to me.

Worst part is the towels were dirty and the shampoo\/conditioners in the shower were already half used! I tried to get someone on the phone but again because they are short staffed it didn't get me anywhere.

I booked a 4-day stay at the SLS in order to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday as well as to ask her to marry me. I had heard that the SLS was a small hotel, recently refurbished and that it provided a hip and trendy way yet friendly atmosphere. I was especially attracted to the fact that the SLS is somewhat removed from the strip and that afforded us some much needed quiet and privacy.

24-hours prior to my arrival I called the hotel to confirm my reservation (which I booked directly with the hotel on-line) as well as to advise reservations that I had a late flight in and therefore required late check-in. At first the agent couldn't locate my reservation and actually told me that I did not have one. After 20-minutes on the telephone he finally located my reservation under the confirmation number i had given him. He told me that he would notate the system about the late arrival and that I should have no problems from there.

I arrived at the SLS shortly before midnight on the 8th only to find out that my reserved room had been assigned to someone else. The agent at the counter seemed clueless about what to do next so I jokingly suggested that she upgrade me to a suite - which she said she would do. The problem? Well the ""suite"" was a room with two under-sized double beds. Given that this was supposed to have been a romantic getaway long weekend I did not consider the sleeping arrangements to be ideal. I then proceeded to call the front desk who told me they would call me at 10AM the next day when my original room became available. The call never came.

At 11:00 AM on the 9th I went to the front desk to inquire about the room and was told by the employee that no rooms were available, that I should consider myself lucky to have the room I had because it was better than my original room and that perhaps I should check out and try to check back in after 3PM if something became available. Really?!?!?! Not being able to tolerate any more stupidity my girlfriend and I decided to go to the SLS buffet for breakfast. While on the way I stopped to ask an employee if the buffet was open and where it was located. They told me that they didn't know where it was located and went on to tell me that they were likely no longer serving food at 11:30 AM so my girlfriend and I went to the MGM buffet instead. We subsequently found out that the SLS Buffet is indeed open for breakfast, lunch and dinner - but more to follow on that one. 

While all of this was going on my girlfriend was attempting to track down a package that she had delivered to the hotel. The person at the front desk told her to check with the FedEx Office. The FedEx Office told her to check with the mail room. Nobody knew anything about the package so I asked the concierge and explained the story to her. She was surprised to learn that the SLS had an actual mail room. She did locate it, however we were promptly informed that we could not go to the mail room because it was an employee only area. The concierge was helpful in that she offered to have a bell-hop deliver the package, the problem however is that the package wasn't delivered to us until 4-hours after the request.

Back to the room fiasco - we stayed in the room with the undersized beds. The lack of helpfulness of the staff wore us out.

Back to the buffet - we finally made it there Sunday. The food was great, it's a shame that there was nobody around to bring us drinks - the wait staff (in typical SLS fashion) was missing and less than helpful.

Oh and then there is the cab ride where the valet at the gate stopped our cab driver to yell at him (using profanities) and asking what country he thought he was driving in because he accidentally turned out in the wrong direction.

To top it all off everyone at the SLS kept addressing me as Mr. Fxxxxo when my name is Sxxxxxe. Fxxxxo is my girlfriends last name. Given that I made the reservations, that I paid for the trip and that everything was under Sxxxxxe I am unsure why the SLS couldn't get something as simple as my name right. 

SLS - Our experience was horrible. I ended up not proposing to my girlfriend because of the stress that you put on both of us. You ruined my girlfriend's long birthday weekend and we will never be back. It's really a shame because on the surface the SLS is a great hotel but when you put lipstick on a pig you still have a pig and that is exactly what the SLS is - a painted pig.

Again, I expect this will fall on deaf ears but I really needed to vent.",66,28,13

First off, this is not your typical Las Vegas casino--so if you're a traditionalist--you probably won't like this place. I definitely  think, however, that there is a niche market that was filled with the opening of SLS. Emphasis is not on gambling, but rather hospitality which is what SLS is known for. 

Now, while first day openings are rarely smooth--our experience goes beyond first day glitches. We tried to check into our room. We waited over 1.5 hours and were still not given the room we were promised. Service in general is too laid back and relaxed; not very good (our checkin felt like we were in line at the DMV). The room we were given smelled like mildew (I don't even understand why) and attempted to call the first desk to be moved. We were on hold for 45 min and finally just went downstairs to deal with it in person. Also, the room we were given is much, much smaller than what we get at other casinos we patronize. Our casino host has been MIA, and claims she does not have great phone reception (tool of the trade if you're a host--lame excuse). We also attempted to change our restaurant reservations but had to wait until the evening when the restaurant opened because apparently, none of the systems are linked and it could not be accessed. 

I wish this hotel and Casino great success, but I personally prefer the Wynn or Venetian--which are truly first class.",17,4,1

We were placed in the World Tower.  Overheard some other tower is the newest one.  Double bed room.  Let me tell you do not try to fit 4 people in here.  It was just a friend and I and the two of us were a tight fit.  2 double beds is exactly what you get, nothing more nothing less.  No dresser or drawers of any kind.  A desk underneath the TV and that's it.  Tiny closet space.  The bathroom was nice but the room is just tiny.  For two partiers it was what we needed it to be, a place to sleep, but for all the fees and everything I wouldn't come back.  The wifi was terrible, so they subtracted their  ""resort fee"" and that made it closer to what it was worth in my mind, a standard double bed, small window, tight spaced room.  The hallways were nice and the lobby as well.  Otherwise I don't have much to say.  The front desk staff wasn't anything to write home about.  The room service staff was the nicest but that's probably because they take their 20% gratuity off top.  I mean it's vegas so it is what it is but I wouldn't stay here again, even if I wanted a large suite.  Just didn't seem all that worth it, especially compared to the fancy pics.",0,0,0

The room design was weird.  Our bed was in the middle of the room facing towards the window so you walked around all four sides of the bed to walk around.  The wall behind the bed had a sink and mirror in the middle, the toilet of the left side behind a sliding closet door and the shower was on the right behind a closet door.  The doors don't close all of the way so you can hear everything going on in the bathroom.  The bed lights up instead of having lamps in the room and there is a mirror over the bed.  Really?!  The finishes and details of the room weren't done properly.  Some things looks old and worn out for being a new hotel.
We also noticed too much staff and not enough to do.  The girl in the gift shop was eating a sandwich while customers were in the store, other people were at their post looking bored.  Some people would stop and ask to see your room key, others would look away when you approached, a couple of people would smile but not say anything.  So why are they standing there?  Hell if I know...not really security but maybe to look like they are security?  
For being a new hotel and trying to draw interest I really thought they would have stepped up their game.  Hire the best, friendliest people that understand service.  Pay attention to the finishes and room design.  Make it a worthwhile experience. 
The gym was a nice place to work out but a lot of the machines were out of order.  The restaurants were really good and the slots actually pay out!

I took a spontaneous road trip over and chose to stay at SLS since I caught what appeared to be a good deal via Orbitz.  I arrived late evening and did not check in until after midnight.  The valet was kind enough to allow me to park my car out front while I checked in.  When I returned to my car to retrieve my luggage they told me valet was free so I was able to just head up to my room.  Having hotel staff at the entrance of every tower made it feel a bit safer.  I reached the 27th floor only to discover my room is the last room on the corner.  Once inside, it did not matter.  Besides the room feeling a bit cramped, the posh decor and fully stocked mini bar made up for it.  I got a nice breeze through the window as well as nice city view.  After checking out the TV limits, I decided on room service the next morning from one of the hotel restaurants listed.              Next morning, I turn on my laptop only and discover that I can't access the wifi.  I call guest services and she transfers my call to their tech person.  He tells me that because I have a Mac, there wifi is not Safari friendly and he comes up and installs Google for me.  He was pleasant and arrived shortly after.                There is a knock at my door and I am only expecting the tech but he has a friend in tow.....a hotel staff member.....that is a guy. I chuckle because my chuckle was far less sarcastic than the comments I had ready to slip from my mouth. Who sends two men to a women's hotel room? Who?  After the installation of Google, and patiently searching for a signal, he concluded that unless I stood in the hallway to surf, I could not get service in my room.                  I phone g\/s again to inform them that there is no internet available in my room and they offer to move me.  Since my room was already nice, cool, and cozy, I could only imagine it getting better since I was already inconvenienced and since I could not go downstairs at the time, I had them bring the new key to my current room.       Now my morning will involve packing and moving...through a hot azz hallway, down the elevator and up another hot azz hallway and I'm not even dress for the day. I open this door and I am so disappointed.  Smaller than the first room and hot. My view was no more and the AC was not working properly.  I had already spent a good 30-40 min with the tech guy in the prev. rm.  Since the air was not working and I was using the window for air in the other room I thought I could deal w\/it and just open the window but the window would not open.  I had to make that call again and all g\/s cared to know was if I had wifi. What I did know is that the second room was worse than what I was booked in and my accommodations should not be sacrificed just so that they can meet my obligation of providing free internet.  Up comes another hotel worker to check my internet in the 2nd room.  Yep, he had trouble with guest wifi and connected me into the hotels wifi instead.  So I now have internet but its fkking hot as heck and not at all comfortable.  I call g\/s again because the experience had reached beyond unacceptable.  Their solution surprises me, they will move me to....another room.        OMG! This time I have them send up a luggage cart because I am not doing the sweaty walk of shame again.  3rd room!  Hotel dude opens the door, I walk in only to be hit by a blob of funky azz funk!  It smelled as if two nasty fat, hairy men had just come from the the gym and then decided to have sex on everything in the room before leaving.  The smell was so strong that if your eyes were closed you would think there was a sweaty man standing in front of you.  I even asked if he smelled it and he did that oh I'm busted expression because he smelled it from the gate too. He asked if I wanted him to send up maid service.  For what?  What are they going to do that they have not done already, spray air freshener?  (I'm confused) How is it that the room is clean and the smell is so potent?  How?       He takes me back to the 2nd room but before he leaves, I have him try to open the window but it's not happening and I have to call maintenance.  They confirm they'll be at my door within 20min.  They never show up.   By now I'm starving and the whole experience was leaving a very bad taste in my mouth.  4pm and I am still in this hotel stuck. So I call gs to let them know how unpleasant this stay has been.  Guess what, g\/s is not answering.  After 5 min of ringing I hang up and call from my cell.  After 28 min of that, I pack again and downstairs to talk to them face to face but now I need to see the mgr.       The mgr comes right away.  (I still have my phone ringing from gs), upgrades me to a suite and offers to comp my weekend.       I get back home and work on getting a refund and they deny me the refund promised.

First off, as many previous reviewers have noted - THE ROOMS ARE VERY SMALL. We stayed in one of the standard rooms in the World a tower. I understand that we didn't pay for a suite, but what kind of hotel provides full sized beds? Really? Not even a queen? We gave a shot at having an extra bed delivered, but even the staff said the room was literally to small to do so. We ended up last-minute ordering another room to fit a total of 4 people.

I instantly noticed the decor of this hotel and how blatantly resemblant of The Shining and Clockwork Orange it was. As a movie buff, this is kind of intriguing to me. As a casual hotel guest, however, I found it quite strange and eerie.

My biggest issue with the whole experience was the fact that we had a room on the 21st floor, but you wouldn't think so considering HOW LOUD the club music was blaring all day and all night. I literally felt like my hotel room was located in the heart of a nightclub. During the daytime I was a bit more understanding since I wasn't in the room for very long, but I draw the line when the music is still pounding until 3am and I'm trying so hard to sleep.

It felt like our room had two twin beds which I've never seen in a Las Vegas hotel room. Super tiny with a just okay view of Circus Circus and some parking lots. The TV was large though! The toiletries smelled good but we didn't get the full-sized toiletries that others did not did we get 'extra' stuff like mouth wash. The room was very clean. One weird observation is that there were no drawers in the room, only a closet to hang your clothes. I find that odd. As for the decor, there was a very weird and creepy shade cover with a bunch of random people. I pulled the shade cover all the way up because it creeped me out so much!! Some of the decor was very cheap looking, like the blinds and the lamp. The infinity mirrors were really cool. It took me a couple of seconds to realize that the button that looks like a key hole was the on\/off switch to the surrounding lights. The crooked map on the table bothered me a lot! I kept wanting to fix it!!

The casino itself is very nice. The elevator waiting area is super bright with mirrors everywhere! The casino is far from the center of the Las Vegas strip. I think there is a monorail that takes you to the center of the strip that is located very close to the hotel.

Self parking at SLS is very easy. When we stayed at the hotel, the self parking garage elevator was not working. You have to go up and down the stairs and, if you have luggage, that's pretty lame.",0,0,0

On vests of the dealers on the floor, on the ironing boards in the room (can't speak for all rooms\/towers), on the wall in one of the tower lobby elevators... those were the only places I saw them.  I would say that the towers are kind of confusing when trying to get to your room.  We had to go through 2 before finding the one we were in.  Each one also had different paint on the walls...

However, I was mostly underwhelmed with the overall experience in staying here for 2 nights. The the hallway carpets had stains on them. The casino is pretty corny\/small. The ventilation system doesn't work well because the casino and hallways wreaked like smoke with a nasty cover-up perfume that was so strong designed to mask the scent, but made the smell even more intolerable. The general population who stayed here seemed to be minorities and foreigners. The pool is very nice but not enough lounge chairs and too many old people (although it was a weekday). I would not stay here again because it feels like they did a half-butt job of remodeling this place and there are much better options in Vegas and much closer to the action (SLS is way up on the north end). The only logistical benefit was that even though the hotel is far away, it was right next to the tram station so you could go up and down the strip relatively easily. I would not stay here again, however I would return to eat at Katsuya.",0,2,0

As fellow Yelper mentioned to me via text ""that hotel is supposed to be a great place to have sex""  well I am not sure about that as I didn't get to have any sex while there. But there were plenty of mirrors in the room so you can watch yourself having great sex.  There was also a little box for sale in the room that contains 4 condoms and a little vibrator. My 16 year old daughter made this awesome discovery known us in on it over dinner, hilarious.  Oh and the plastic bed and couch lite up and had dimmers.  Serious, this is a thing and once again my daughter figured this out.  She decided to stay back while the rest of us went to Freemont Street. 

The Casino,  I really don't know much about gambling except that  I am not good at it, but it is fun.  We sat at the bar and pushed little buttons on those machines for awhile and the bartenders were absolutely killing it.  You can tell that they have been working together and enjoying them selves for quite awhile.  They seemed to have a couple of preset up mini routines to react to some of the standard tourist bullshit questions\/comments they hear constantly.  One of the guys was a total throw back to Tome Cruise in Cocktail- where they juggle the bottles etc.  Still fun to watch.

I loved the contemporary styling and am grateful that I did not have to go into the yellow-orange bathroom with a hang over.  That would have been painful.  The room was clean and the linens were fresh.  I am not sure how well that style will look cool before it becomes this WTF were they thinking with the plastic light up furniture.  BTW the couch was horrible uncomfortable.  Another thing that was bothersome was the mini bar, we were advised not to take items out because we would be charged for them. I guess there is a sensor if something is removed for more then a minute or so. Anyway I wanted to refrigerate a few items that we brought to snack on and a refrigerator would have been nice. Oh well we had a cooler so I figured we could just continue to use that, grab the ice bucket and go on a search for the ice machine..... nothing. So I called the service desk I am told I needed to go to Perq (coffee house in the lobby) to request ice from them, or I could they could transfer and I could request that it be sent up. They didn't know how long it would take and neither do I because I wasn't going to wait in my room for ice. 

Over all I did enjoy my stay there and would possibly stay there again. But I do enjoy trying new places in Vegas.",2,1,2

It was a last minute trip for only one night and as someone that visit Vegas often I have stayed many places on the strip. The worry withy the SLS was the distance to the main portion of the strip. The monorail resolved that issue and is cheaper than a cab cause almost no one should be driving late in Vegas ;). The room was smaller but clean and modern. The pool was exciting and good size. We ate at Ku that night and my bf who has eaten noodles in Hong Kong said that it was right up there with the authentic noodles he ate there.

I can't understand why they don't have 5 stars... but don't let that discourage you from experiencing pure heaven.  This hotel is for the younger (at heart) - this is not your standard luxury hotel, but more of a stylish luxurious trendy spot for those that want to get away and relax. 

 We stayed at 3 other hotels: The Hilton Grand Vacation Suites, The Tropicana and The Flamingo.  SLS was the best by far.  

The rooms were simply amazing.  If you love White Contemporary decor and plus bedding - this is the place.  All of the rooms are decorated in a bright motif that blends modern living with a splash of happiness. I could have stayed there forever - especially in our amazing room(s).  

 We staying in the World Tower for 2 days and 1 day in the Luxe Tower. Both rooms were amazing, but my favorite for space was the Luxe Tower.  If you need more closet space and drawers to putt your things away, I highly suggest The Luxe Tower, because it has a full closet system in the bathroom (for extended stays). The Luxe Tower room also included a bathrobe and 2 sets of house slippers with the SLS logo in them (which are yours to keep). The All-White drawer safes were amazing cutting-edge. Oh -- and the shower in the Luxe Tower is ah-mazing! Actually, the showers were amazing in both rooms we stayed in at SLS. 

My Favorite feature was the Infinity Mirrors in the World Tower room!!! They were large, wall-height mirrors with a push-botton light, opposite from each other.  When you light up both mirrors, you can see yourself reflected, front-to-back to infinity (and beyond). This feature alone kept us enthralled for hours. All bedding was white and super cozy. Hotel bedding is not always the best, but at SLS, everything was bright white and super clean, We we felt safe to use all of the bedding, because of its obvious cleanliness. I could have stayed in my room the duration of the entire trip - and still felt like I had a great time!

We especially loved the Amazingly Friendly Staff ....and all of the food choices.  Many of the other hotels had a very uptight vibe. We could tell the staff wasn't enjoying their jobs, which reflected in their treatment to guests. AT SLS, the staff was amazing - we felt like part of the family.  

From the porters to housekeeping to supervising staff - the experience was simply wonderful.  There was not one bad attitude or rude employee in the building - which is a lot to say for a fully staffed hotel & casino. We spoke to a very sweet porter named Ana Franco, who explained that the SLS Hotel & Casino tells all of their staff that their first priority is - and always is - assuring that guests are comfortable and enjoying their stay.  A quick conversation with her lovely supervisor, Martine Davis - who quickly arrived on the casino floor to speak with us upon request, absolutely confirmed this fact. 

Even the housekeeping staff was friendly and helpful. We got locked out of our room, and we were assisted by Elizabeth, Angelica, Ratu' ( a sweet African lady), and Pedro, who were all quite gracious and friendly, ensuring that  security was coming and that we got into our room in a timely manner. Their smiles were infectious, as was their obvious joy in working at such a lovely place. My husband and I were quite impressed, especially after being treated *Quite Terribly* by The Tropicana staff during our 3 day stay at that hotel. Our bellman was named Bobby and he was quite amazing, too!  He really made us feel welcome and even gave us a bunch of great recommendations for our stay. 

Security was quite helpful and friendly - which is unfortunately rare in a place like Vegas.  They really understand how to keep the peace without throwing around bad attitudes, a skill that was absent at other hotels like Tropicana.  With a new guard at our tower every 2 hours, we were pleasantly surprised that each and every one of them was friendly and professional. We spoke at length with Jeffrey (from Chicago) of the security team, who was quite helpful and informative. We felt really protected and cared for by him and the entire security team.

We ate at Northside Cafe, Umami Burger, and Cleo, a Mediterranean restaurant. SLS was so great that we never really ventured onto the strip - and I have been in Vegas Many Many times, but SLS met all of our needs and is now our new home-away-from-home. We LOVE SLS! We feel like we gained a huge family there -- the staff. :)",2,0,1

Only issue I had was the mirrors. There are too many mirrors. They are everywhere. I'm sure there are some people that would enjoy that, but it felt like a House of Horrors.

I liked the sportsbook. It's a little different and cool. Virtually no lines. Waitresses are decent (while gambling).

My other issue (and I did Hotwire, so I kind of got screwed). It's so far away from everything. Maps don't do it justice. If it wasn't so far, I would have no problem staying again. I'll probably just stay at a Total Rewards next time though.",0,0,0

- Check in:  we were given key cards to our room that don't work. TWICE!  Receptionist promised to send security up to help us out, no sight of them. We ended up getting a different room.
- Pool: My friend was addressed as ""I don't make the rule here, son"" when he asked why water cost $8
- Casino: Bad attitude from dealers, they stared and yelled at our group for no freaking reason
- Elevator: Nightmare. The wait for both going up and going down is 5-10mins. We gave up and took the stairs 9 floor down couple of times. 
- Parking structure:  The whole structure smells like weeds. Feel unsafe. Elevator doesn't work either

Beds are insanely comfortable and the shower head was amazing. (Rain head) 

The vibe of the pool is very mellow. Loved that. 

Cons:
LiFE- the nightclub there. Got harassed by the bouncers two nights in a row trying to get in. They were extremely rude. The club isn't worth the trouble. Go somewhere else. 

The pool waitresses. Don't waste your time just go to the bar. The bartenders at the pool are attentive and fast. Even if I tired waving down a waitress I just got ignored.",3,2,1

No basic items like a flat sheet for the bed, coffee maker, and the whole mini fridge where you can't move their stuff.  

Had a negative experience up on check-in where the reception person double charged me on my room (my company had already paid for it).  Sooo they charged an extra $1,050 onto my debit card.  After I realized and came back to get this fix, the person who attempted to help me fix it was very underwhelmed.  In fact, he didn't seem to be that alarmed that I was about to spend a weekend in Vegas $1k in the hole.  Then when he didn't resolve it as I thought, the manager helped me who was equally unsympathetic.

This is horrible SLS!

The bed, .........Jesus, the BED!!!! I swear if sleeping on a cloud or mattress of cotton balls was ever a such thing, this would be its equivalent. 

From valet parking down to the saunter in, this hotel oozes swag. Well, perhaps ooze isn't all that lovely an adjective,... however what this place does wreak of is DESIGNER IMPOSTER PERFUME! While its initially somewhat refreshing as it provides the hotel a bit of a unique appeal... it honestly began to get on my nerves as I saw a migraine approaching merely while checking in and I couldn't help but question if this is what Blanche would wear on 'The Golden Girls'. Now that I've mentioned it SLS....feel free to thank me for being a friend---

Add to that ^^^ the stench from lingering cigarette smoke brought to you courtesy of the adjacent casino and I'm led to question whether or not Victoria's Secret is actually ""Nicotine"".

Stefany, a fellow Yelp friend of mine and previous reviewer of this hotel probably stated it best, ...the entire hotel embodies that of Los Angeles. I was just made aware however, that it originated in West Hollywood. This Las Vegas location is kind of ""a test"" on a new demographic. Bearing the LA theme in mind, I can honestly envision douchebags and wannabe hot chicks flocking to this place in droves all flashing their abnormally white teeth, oversized implants, collagen lips and nectarine tans.

From the establishment's lounges to the slot machines, thereon to the swanky restaurants alongside the hotel's very rooms themselves....sexy is clearly the goal here HOWEVER the question becomes more questionable of just whether or not the message attempted to be conveyed was actually achieved.

Leading us to the topic of the rooms themselves... 

Those of us traveling from LA are no strangers to subpar square footages. We'll make a micro-loft out of a sardine can and a cracker box...., and that into consideration, I'm led to speak up on this place maximizing EVERY square foot down to the mirrored ceilings, lol.

From walk in,... the bed, positioned in the room's center shares floor space with a small sofa at its foot. This is met by a fully stocked bar that the hotel makes no hesitation in notifying guest(s).....breathing on the merchandise will result in imminent death---

Note: There is no stocking of your own merchandise within the hotel's fridge' AND opening the door for a period in excess of 30 seconds will result in guest(s) being charged $30 minimum.

Wow. Just wow.

Without a doubt do I love the aesthetics of the place as a whole. Once again, from the mirrored ceilings to the mounted flatscreen, this place is SEXXXY without remorse. DID I MENTION THAT THE BED ILLUMINATES?! Yes. The backlight possesses a dimmer that takes the aura to a whole' nubba' lebba'!!! Then there are the upgraded fixtures and the rain shower nozzle. Yazz yazzz!

I can't for the life of me determine the overall theme, but apparently they're going for ""Grown and Sexy"" with a touch of goth, hipster, chic and a vague hint of divey sprinkled on top.

Disclaimer and definite CON: SLS is far as hell from the rest of the Strip (think Circus Circus and Stratosphere) ....but away from a boatload of traffic and pedestrian congestion as well. That can serve as a definite pro and con all in one.

1\/2 a point deduction however for the room's needing better window sound treatments. I'm uncertain of whether or not the windows are dual-paned however we were soon made aware upon checking in, that this was Rock In' Rio weekend, ....NOT BY THE STAFF, but by the sound of bass vibrating upon the windows..................and this was from the 14th floor!!!! Dammit Taylor Swift! I also didn't notice any coffee makers. Boo for that!

The additional 1\/2 point deduction is from the genius concierge that ""transferred me to valét"" when I attempted to request my car be pulled around ONLY TO FIND that valét didn't even have a frikkin' extension. She needs to be smacked! 

This could also use some work guys. The only way to request your transpo-, is to physically come down to the first floor and present your ticket stub. 

Super.....   -__-

Would I knock this place off my list? Without a doubt, HECK NO. I'm actually looking forward to my\/our next stay here and thanks to promotional marketing at one of the ground level kiosks offering one free night's stay to those taking time out enough to register......I'll be returning SOONER rather than LATER!!!

The rooms are clean, comfortable, and the deco is very sleek and modern. Service is ALWAYS good here and their gift shops have great products. The pool is very well maintained and you also get excellent customer service. We rented a cabana last summer for a really good deal. Our waitress was MJ and she was attentive and very friendly. The dining options are a wonderful variety of cuisines. Even though it is far at the end of the Strip, a CHEAP 24 hour pass for the monorail ($12) is available and has stops all along the Strip.

The staff is so friendly and eager to accommodate their guests. This is the second time I have stayed here and will definitely be staying here again. It is a brand new hotel and most sites have it listed as a 4 star hotel but I would argue that it should be a 4.5 or maybe even 5 star hotel. The pool is amazing and has a very miami beach feel to it. There are couches everywhere which are much more comfortable than lawnchairs and during the week they are free and you don't have to pay anything to use them. There are three towers: The lux tower, world tower, and story tower. The lux tower is a bit more expensive but has nicer rooms. The story tower has very small rooms but they are really fun and creative rooms. The world tower rooms are larger than the story rooms. All rooms have a 60 inch plasma TV. It is at the very north end of the strip but there is a monorail stop literally outside the doors of the SLS which will take you anywhere on the strip for $5! It's a lot cheaper than those crooked cab drivers. The only cab I used was to the airport and back. The casino is a fun and there are plenty of restaurants (Umami burger, 800 degrees pizza, Ku noodles, etc.). And again, customer service is top notch. If you call and make a request (room service, towels, housekeeping, etc.) they will call your room and make sure you received what you asked for and if everything was to your satisfaction.

Typically, we enjoy staying at recently renovated\/revamped hotels in Vegas because often times these hotels offer superior customer service as they are still building a ""clientele.""  The SLS offered pros and cons, but ultimately, in the end, the cons sadly outweighed the pros for us.

Pros:  THE MONORAIL.  The monorail is the biggest perk of staying here.  Valet service was outstanding, Umami Burger is worth a trip to the hotel alone, hotel is clean, but I refuse to call it modernized, because it's essentially hipsterized, hotel provided toiletries are made in house at the Ciel Spa (pretty impressive), blackjack dealers were exceptionally friendly and very helpful.

Cons:  Right out the gate, SLS rubbed me the wrong way.  I expected a ""resort fee"" in addition to the nightly fare.  What I did NOT expect and have NOT experienced at the other 5 hotels I've been a guest of in Vegas, was the $150.00 PER NIGHT hold that is immediately placed on your card.  We were slated for a two night stay, which meant an immediate $300 hold was placed on my card.  Most, if not all, Las Vegas hotels will place a hold on your card, but never have I ever heard of a $150.00 per night of your stay hold.  Can you imagine if you were scheduled for a five night visit?  That's a $750.00 hold on your funds.  Oh, and it took a minimum of 48 hours for that hold to be lifted once we left.  In addition, there is a strong perfume\/fragrant odor in the lobby, escalator area, etc., as if fragrance was pumped in through the vents.  It was strong enough that we both ended up with migraine headaches from it.  And, despite us having a non-smoking room, we could smell smoke coming in through the vents in the bathroom.  On that note...the bathroom door was nothing more than a sliding mirror, and in our room at least it left a gap of about 1\/2 an inch, so the person in the bathroom had very little privacy, because you could hear every thing, down to the tearing of toiletpaper.  

I personally enjoyed the decor of the room, my husband did not.  It was a little cheesy having the mirrors all around us, but maybe that's just me.  The crowd reminded me of a mix of Jersey Shore and Portlandia.  For us, the SLS is a no-go in the future.",1,0,0

The bed was in the middle of the small room. The sink was directly behind it and the shower and toilet on each side with sliding doors. If you used the mirror or sink and somebody wanted to go in the bathroom it might hit your head.
They did not supply a plastic bag in the closet, wait there was no closet it was just a rack and two drawers. 
WORST: There was no ice machine on the floor. So to get ice you had to order ice from in-house dining and then tip the person for the ice. Also if you order more than 2 ice buckets they will charge you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After about an hour in the phone attempting to reach the new manager on duty (they forwarded me to security manager who was also confused as to why they did that), I finally went downstairs to speak to a manager who said she would remove the charge temporarily and then call me to inform me about the investigation. Received no call again and also found that the unauthorized charge of $510 posted to our credit card. After 3 HOURS of being passed around, they finally reversed the charges.

It's a smaller hotel at the end of the strip , the rooms are decent sized but very comfortable . It reminded me of a cool modem LA room .

the monkey bar was also really relaxing and also hilarious . Our bartender , Timothy hooked us up with some perfect screwdrivers and we got to hang out and listen to a piano player . We tipped him a few dollars and he took request and sang everything.. Literally anything you could think of .. I requested the thong song and he sang it haha . Awesome .

The hotel loses 1 star due to the smoke odor in the hotel . It's covered by a fragrance , but it's still really smokey . Also the front desk wasn't very customer friendly , although I know they would all claim to be . He forgot to give us our free drink coupon and he was kind of snappy when I asked about free entry to the club .

I admit, this COULD be a place people like, but as someone who goes to Vegas to play some table games and relax, it wasn't me.  

I booked SLS because I had received a free room promotion from them.  I don't recall which tower I was in except that it was not the Lux tower.  Our room was way too small for two people and the bathroom set up, while stylish, was awkward and gave virtually no privacy.  The clunky light up bed frame and couch were cool to look at when we walked in, but took up so much space!  Further, the shower had some random hairs on the wall and the toilet room had... something... on the wall.  The room felt claustrophobic and not very clean.

The soap and shampoo was nice, but there was no ice bucket or ice machine and we didn't even think about touching that minibar- which took up even more space.  Further, their clever labels on the snacks were peeling off and looked as tacky as the random masking tape on the wall next to the fire sprinkler.

Beyond the room, signage in the parking garage was poor.  We entered at what seemed to be the main entrance and ended up on a stage where a band was playing with all of our luggage.  We wandered the casino floor and could not find a sign that said ""registration.""  After asking a table dealer, we arrive to the registration line with only two people taking care of a long line of people.

The whole place seemed geared for a first impression, but at the cost of being practical. 

The staff was a bit aloof as well.  The guy who checked us in talked quietly and quickly, the CODE desk guy made awkward small talk.  he asked what I thought of my room and when I told him, the conversation ended.

One late morning, I was walking by a the main pool where a hotel guest was asking about what the deal was and the guard said condescendingly, ""Well, you could go to the kiddie pool.""

The casino wasn't very big, which is normally a good thing to me, but it felt limited.   There isn't much in walking distance as an alternative either.  Also, it was so very cold down there.

There was a pool concert one night and we arrived back around 11.  We drove all of the way to the top of the structure and found the last spot.

This is probably a good place for a group of young friends who want to feel like they're doing something stylish and hip and will not be in a mind to notice that there isn't much behind the style.

After our first night, we debated switching hotels, but it was free and we would be out all day, so we decided not to.",3,3,0

Got charged $8 to my room for m&m's I didn't even eat. But I called the front desk and they said they would send someone up to do inventory and take it off my bill.

He will soon learn,  I voice record every interaction; when I know I am being treated with malice or against their hotel staffs employee handbooks\/ regulations.  Even to get that help to be escorted like a criminal to my room.  I had to call our firms lawyer to help remind their staff of discrimination and other social justice laws they were violated towards myself and our staff.  A business client of theirs who gave them a second chance after stealing from my associate on our last booked convention with them.   A client who paid well and weeks early to reserve rooms for our staff and management.   Any hotel who needs a lawyer on the line to remind them of the potential law suits and lack of civil - kind treatment; any business should want to provide to their customers; is sleazy and unethical. 

   Theft was their final gift to top off the worst hotel experience of our business travels during our careers.  A couple expensive items were left in 1 of the rooms.  The lost and found gal was very helpful, after she had me wait a day to see if their cleaning staff had turned in the items. When I called today, the items mysteriously disappeared.  Prior; we gave this hotel a shot, and a lap top disappeared from one of our rooms during lunch while towels were bought in by their staff.  Once again; the cleaning staff had reported no knowledge of it, and the hotel did nothing to try to alleviate the 1000.000 plus theft except say the cleaning staff didn't see it.                            Funny enough, our business law firm has been investigating further, and found out each room has camera access; so they simply have to watch the film and prosecute their staff they allow to continually steal from guests.  Two visits = two thefts.  We met others at the hotel guests whom also had expensive items stolen while they were staying, and also were told the staff never saw their items and were offered no solution to the obvious problem of this hotels ongoing theft from clients.  I suggested today, they do ten year background \/ criminal check as our firm and most reputable employers do prior to hiring, to screen out those whom steal.  I was laughed at for the thought. DO NOT SPEND A PENNY HERE , although three of our rooms were ok, but reaked of smoke; that is the only semi - positive thing I can say when speaking honestly. As bad as it gets.",0,0,0

Pool had no towels to offer us. We were told to go the room and get our own. 
They had run out of 4 of the 10 $20 specialty cocktails. The suggestion our server gave us was not good, we did not drink it but were still charged for it. 

We were asked to leave our lounge chairs after we received our drinks because someone was sitting there and one of the other staff members accidentally removed their towels. This was fine, I understand if another guest was sitting there but the server did not even offer to relocate us. Also, those same seats we were asked to leave remained empty for the next hour.

1. I am SHOCKED that Jose Ándres associates his brand with this awful tacky location.

2. If you've ever had the pleasure to go to SLS Beverly Hills, well scratch that.. this place shouldn't even share the same name.

At Check-in they told us they couldn't find our reservation. We showed our confirmation email. After much back and forth they found our reservation and said for $25 extra we could check in early. We refused. And waited for our room... and waited and waited well others in our group received their rooms. Finally at 3:30 we went to check status on our room they said it would be another hour. Ummmm check in is at 3 correct? We asked to speak to a manger and instantly a ""miracle"" happened our room was ready. 

We get to our room. The mini bar shelving has water damage and pieces of the fake wood is rotted and visible. (I wouldn't even go into the tacky decor I read others reviews they sum it up quite nicely.) The AC didn't work, the TV didn't work. We called to have it fixed neither problem was fixed. 
They gave us comp. drink tickets which we went to redeem and the staff could not have been more dismissive.

I booked this hotel on orbitz (had the best deal... See my review on orbitz) price is decent mostly due to the days I chose Friday-sat is the worst. The hotel is north of the strip, so if you think you can walk to the Bellagio... You're gonna need some wheels. From the outside its very strip-worthy big led sign and they have eco friendly landscaping (AstroTurf). One of the parking garage elevators was down... And was down for the entire weekend... In my book quarter star markdown. 
When you walk in I was pleasantly surprised that it's modern and spared us from the violently floral carpets. Check in is at 3pm but you can call the hotel and ask to check in earlier. If not you can plan on standing in line for about 20min-40min on a busy weekend (we went Labor Day weekend) there are 3 ""towers"" we stayed in ""world"" tower it's beautiful, white and light pink line the room to the ceilings. There was a concert at the Foxtail pool... women armed with thong bikinis and ready to jump eager young men who were too blinded by 1000sqft of side-boob.  When the concert is going you need to pay to get in, but you get 1 free pass per keycard if you stay at SLS.... The party was huge and there was police and security in the pool area but unfortunately there was no one inside... A half naked makeup smeared teen decided to try to slap a random person and start a fight and the front desk continues to check people in like its normal another quarter star off. There was another small pool in the ""Lux"" tower and it was also very crowded.
During the night we realized that we were put into the handicapped room that had a door bell outside of it... Add that to the drunk people coming through the hallways... Another quarter star off. Last day we were there the pool hours changed because Labor Day is the last day of summer. So Bam! pools closed on a 100 degree day. Really? Quarter star off. 
Ok negative stuff out of the way. The design is nice, has a spa. But no jacuzzi or bath tubs in any of the rooms. it's a new hotel and about to celebrate its 1 year anniversary. There's an awesome led screen hanging above the casino bar that looks 3D. The food is great. If you have the money try the meat bazar. The pool has a giant silver rubber duck to me is just the most awesome thing ever. There is a door man at the elevator you need to show him your key to get to your room. I mentioned my issue with the doorbell and the front desk was kind enough and removed one of my resort fees which was $29 per night.",1,0,0

You would think that after almost a month had passed since the hotel opened that all of the kinks would have been ironed out.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.

From the time that I drove up to the hotel I was disappointed.  The hotel is in the worst part of town, but I looked past it because the hotel must have great security.  

I drove into the parking structure and there was no clear signage on where to go.  I drove up into the garage and parked on the 4th floor.  I parked near the front of the hotel thinking that I would be close to the front desk.  Boy, was I wrong!  The elevators were not working, so I had to take the stairs all of the way down with my luggage.  Upon entering the hotel, I learned that I had to walk all the way through the hotel to the back to get to the front desk.  It would really help to have signage in the parking garage.  

My first impressions of the casino were not great.  The stairs are concrete stairs like you are in a warehouse.  This is not appealing for the front entrance of a supposed 4 star casino.  The actual casino itself is tiny!  Think off the strip hole in the wall tiny.  Due to the size, it is easy for the casino to become too crowded and not find any games available to play.  My solution to this, don't play here.  I drove to the real strip and played at the Cosmopolitan, which is where I normally stay.  Speaking of the Cosmopolitan, let me say that this place does not even come close to the Cosmopolitan.  

I arrived to the front desk and started the check in process.  The front desk agent said that my reservation was paid with a Visa card; I don't even have a Visa card!  I only use MasterCard, Discover and Amex, I even showed her my wallet that did not have a Visa card in it.  Yet, she insisted that it was paid with a Visa card.  This is not a big deal to me, but the fact that she argued with me about this is what got to me.  I also asked about the room type and she explained the 3 different rooms to me.  I asked to upgrade to another room type and she said no, that they were all sold out.  I told her that I was not asking for a comp upgrade, and that I was willing to pay.  She said that there was nothing available.  

After I got up to my room I checked the SLS website and I saw that there were rooms available to upgrade to and the website even shows how many of each room type are still available.  First, the front desk agent argued with me and then she lied to me.  Is this the kind of employee that works here?

Now to get to the room itself....  I thought that the casino was small, but the rooms are even smaller.  The fact that there is a tiny little window makes the room even smaller.  The functionality of the room is hard to describe.  There are only plugs on one side of the bed.  The couch is too close to the TV, but that is because the room is so small.  There is a little stump next to the couch that is decorative, but I ended up kicking it in the middle of the night in the dark!  The door to the bathroom does not have a lock on it, so no privacy!  

Speaking of the bathroom, there was no shampoo, conditioner, or soap in the bathroom.  Luckily, I travel with my own sundries.  Every hotel, even bottom of the barrel Motel 6 gives sundries in the bathroom. 

The room itself was also very noisy.  I was woken up several times during the night for various reasons.  First, there was an ice machine right outside my door that kept filling itself and I could hear the ice fall.  Second, I was woken up at 7am by hammering.  Third, I was woken up again at 830 by a car alarm going off in the garage.  Yes, the room with no view is close enough to the parking garage to hear all of the noises.  

The A\/C unit was one of the loudest that I have ever seen.  It was very powerful in putting out cold air, but the noise was not worth it! 

The hotel would have been better off completely demolishing the old Sahara hotel instead of renovating it!  You can tell that this was an extremely rushed job that was done to save money.  I would not stay here again or recommend it.  

I hope that hotel makes many major changes, or it will be doomed to close and not have the long history of the Sahara.",12,2,1

The location is AWFUL and so fucking far from the action that it took us about $43-50 round trip each time to get in (to where most of my friends on the strip were) and out.

From check in to the moment we walked out the door, the hotel service was nearly non-existent, save for some wonderful servers in the only places worth talking about - the restaurants. More about those in a moment. 

Our room was apparently in the mid-tier tower, called The World. Unfortunately, though reasonably priced, it lacked a dresser, a non-broken shower handle, a bathtub, a view, or anything else of note. 

The biggest issue however was the complete lack of responsiveness of the hotel. My wife and I were in Vegas on business for five days. On day one we requested an upgrade for which we were happy to pay. We were told that we would get a call in the morning and be moved to our new accommodations soon after that. By noon the next day there as no call. When we rang there was no record of our prior conversation, nor was there a new room. 

We were told the same story about 'one more day'. This happened twice more before it was pointless to to move hotels or rooms. And again, the managers and desk people were barely responsive when we spoke. 

On the plus side, Angie at the concierge desk was amazing. Easy to talk to, accommodating, and helpful. As well, Eliu, in housekeeping was a delight. 

As for the restaurants - they were excellent. Katsuya was outstanding (try the crispy rice and tuna!) and Cleo was equally delicious. Umami burger was one of the best burgers both my wife and I have had.

I've stayed at many hotels on the strip, but more importantly at the SLS in California and attend many different SBE venues. This hotel SLS here is by far the worst experience ever! Starting from when we arrived. I asked the front desk why is the experience here so different than at the SLS in California her response was "" yes you are right the experience is different here because the SLS in California has been open longer so there staff is more experienced. And that this hotel was managed by different people"" 
We proceeded to the room and waited for our extra bed because they did not have the room we booked with two beds and then went down stairs. I felt like every employee here at the hotel thought they were on vacation. No one greeted you as they passed and actually pretty rude. There is absolutely no customer service skills. In the am I called the front desk just to be put on hold longer than the wait at the DMV!! 10min plus. Over all I am very disappointed in the hotel and service, and I am sure if the management new how this place was being run they would be too. Sorry this review is so negative but the experience was truly that bad.",0,2,0

With the food and all the hype surrounding the SLS, I've been pretty excited for the place to open! So much so, that we decided to book a room and stay here on opening night. For a 325 square foot room with a single king bed in the ""Story Tower"", our rate was $209 per night and we stayed just 1 night.

When we first arrived at about 6pm, we made our way to the parking garage that you enter from Paradise. And although we were trying to check in, we weren't allowed to valet or pull up to the front for unloading, as were told they were just too full and busy. After finally finding a spot in the garage, we were faced with broken elevators and had to carry our bags down 5 flights of stairs. Thankfully we just had 1 bag with enough for 1 night, so it wasn't a huge deal, but it was frustrating and not the best first impression. When we got to check-in, they were well aware of the elevator issues and offered us a couple free drinks at the Monkey Bar, which is just across the way. The check-in by the way, was pretty straight forward, quick and painless.

For the rooms, they offer several different types and there's 3 towers...the World Tower, the Lux Tower and the Story Tower, which is where we stayed. The room itself was a bit on the small side, but it was quite impressive. When you walk in, your attention is immediately drawn to the opaque white bed and couch that have dimmable lights build right into them! There's also a 55"" TV hanging from the wall and a giant mirror on the ceiling above the bed that might catch your attention. The styling is very modern with a darker grey paint, and yellow accents underneath a strange industrial concrete style ceiling. Both the bathroom and shower, which are separated, also feature bright yellow tiles, and are hidden behind two large sliding mirrors. For the size of the room, I was pretty impressed with the layout and use of space. And although expensive, the mini bar was nicely stocked. We did have issues with some lights and the TV not working in the room, but that easy to look past. Overall though, I can't say I'd recommend paying $200 a night here...actually about $260 after all taxes, fees, etc.

When it comes to the casino itself, their main focal point seems to be restaurants and nightlife. In my opinion, these are super solid restaurant choices and worth the visit alone. However, if you aren't a partier, you might find yourself bored here. Compared to other casinos, the machines and tables seem to be limited and they are all very close together. There's also minimal shopping choices and apart from a coffee shop, I was surprised to see that they didn't include any type of dedicated dessert\/treat spot here. For the most part though, I thought the overall style of the place was alright. But some things were strange and seemed out of place, like the open industrial ceiling, and the buffet which is upstairs and completely separate from just about everything. By the way, the Sunday breakfast\/lunch buffet was $31, and the dinner $37...ouch!

My feelings on the employees are very mixed. As many people have mentioned, the amount of employees standing around and doing nothing but talking was a bit ridiculous. I can understaff overstaffing for grand opening, but on several occasions we saw 3+ employees in a group just kind of standing around and chatting. We also had our fair share of issues during our stay, and our interaction with the staff was a bit hit and miss. Since this was the first day, I won't get too far into all our issues but we had to visit the desk 3 times and speak with 3 different managers due to room problems and huge bill discrepancies. On Saturday night, we spent an hour dealing with a $140 charge for two drinks at the Monkey bar. Then on Sunday, it took us over an hour just to check out because our bill was beyond messed up, to the tune of over $200. However, Aubrey who checked us out was extremely nice, patient and seemed genuinely apologetic about the mess we had on our hands. She was the reason I decided to bump this review up to 3 stars, instead of 2. 

With SBE behind the place, I really thought they would have a lot smoother launch. I mean, you obviously can't expect a flawless experience on opening weekend, but I was a bit surprised to see just how many issues they had. I was also disappointed with some of the pricing they have set up. Bottled beers at the center bar are $8 each and a Gatorade at The Perq coffee shop was $5! Yes, it's a casino but c'mon. And why are there no locals specials for anything?

All in all, we had a great time and the restaurants will surely keep me a regular at SLS. However, it was a bit overhyped and unless they bring out some killer room rates, this wouldn't be my choice for another staycation.",29,4,15

I was a little wary but there were also some very positive reviews and the price was excellent so I figured I'd take a chance. Here is my take on the main issues that seem to divide the reviews.


Atmosphere:

Someone in the reviews said lipstick on a pig, this is entirely untrue. It is legitimately cool. The restaurants were stylish and quite good. The clientele are above average stylish, largely a combo of young LA crowd and convention goers who seemed to prefer a little style. You won't find many people gambling on a weeknight so the casino part may seem a bit empty but the restaurants, bars etc all pretty vibrant.


Location:


You'd have to know very little about las Vegas to not realize the limitations of the location before arriving. Yes, its a $15 cab ride from most attractions and the surrounding area is somewhat sketchy. That said, you get a free shuttle to and from the airport if you are fortunate w timing (its hourly and a bit tricky to find from the airport, I suggest calling ODS the operator of the shuttle when you land and ask them if its leaving soon and where it is). 


The location is also decent if you

Are going to the convention center

Like going downtown lv

Like going to the north part of strip (Wynn\/fashion show mall etc) 

You have a car

Don't mind taking the monorail


Rooms:


I can evaluate the world tower which is the middle tier. Room was definitely comfortable, great bed, great shower. It was also spacious, apparently the rooms in the story tower are pretty small.


The one fairly substantial downside of SLS is there is quite a bit of street noise. You can also hear the monorail station loud speaker if your room is lower down. You might want to stay as high up as you can get. I also found it helpful to turn the fan to ON instead of auto to create a steady white noise. Yes, if you are sensitive to noise this is going to be the main issue for you. With the fan on I felt it was ok.


I stayed twice so had two different rooms. The first room was spotless, in my second room the shower seemed like it didn't get the world's best cleaning job.


Service: 


Front desk was OK. A couple of different young ladies at the front desk could work on their interpersonal skills. It was not a big deal though.

Service at umami burger and northside was good. Service at bar at Katsuya was really excellent.


Internet:


I had near perfect internet in both my rooms and this was one thing I was very concerned about.


The resort fee:


Higher than more premium properties which is perplexing. Also, given how low their room rates are the resort fee really stands out. That said, I've never had a free shuttle to the airport elsewhere so that somewhat offsets.


Conclusion:


For the price (less than $100 weekend and $50 weekday w some freebies thrown in) + free airport transportation the SLS is a comfortable and stylish choice for a las Vegas trip on a budget. I'll definitely consider it in the future if I find a similar deal.",1,0,0

This is a great value for a 4-star hotel, but it's a place for you to drop your bags and go party\/shop\/eat elsewhere. It lacks that Vegas-buzz and can feel more like a sleepy boutique hotel.

This is the worst place I've ever stayed. (Including a hotel w\/ bed bugs). It started with the tiny room with the shower and toilet in two separate closets. Next, the phone in the room didn't work. 2 hours later once the phone was fixed I finally received my luggage. I love to party. I have no problem with rowdy crowds. SLS was having a grand opening of their pool\/club. The ""party"" started around noon and our whole room shook from the rave like bass for 2 days during the day. We went out at night as most people do in Vegas. Also...I couldn't get any ice. Waited once for 2 hours only to talk to some very rude lady saying that there was another hour wait for the ice that never came. When I asked about ice machines I was informed that I didn't have security clearance to get to ice machines. On the second day the power went out. (Probably from all the wattage that was pulled for that amazing base for the hotel shaking pool party).  Finally, the elevator stopped working and I was forced in a service elevator with one of their security people who cussed the whole elevator ride about how terrible SLS. Checked into Trump hotel today. The asked us about our Vegas experience and we told them about the clown shoe operation SLS was running and upgraded our room for free.

These spots must have a purpose, but they are creepy, and in fact my daughter said she had nightmares that night about the blood on the ceiling.

I disagree with other reviews that were negative on the after hours food selection... those are wrong.  They have a 24\/7 café with everything from waffles to Mexican Food.  They also have a gift\/snack shop that's 24\/7.  Service was friendly and they were able to check us into our room at 11:30am (check in time is 3pm, we arrived at 8:30 am).  Wished they had a 5$ roulette table when I was there from Sunday-Tuesday.  I would of played more but they only had 10-15$ limit.

Definitely not a 5 star hotel like the Cosmo, Wynn, or Encore.  I stayed in the World Tower and the room was alright.  The decor was nice, but the wall paper was ugly.  Shower only so don't expect a soaking tub.  At the right price point, I'd consider staying again.  I've listed a few pros and cons:
Pros:
1.  Registration is right next to the entrance of the hotel.  No super far walk like some hotels.
2.  Lots of restaurant choices.  Will have to come back to try The Bazaar.
3.  Comfortable bed with nice linen.
4.  Nice sized 55in Samsung LCD TV.
5.  Lots of big mirrors on walls.  
6.  A short drive to the Wynn ,Encore, or fashion mall.  
7.  Gave me complimentary late check out at 1pm when I asked the front desk.
8.  Pool area looked nice.
9.  Cold AC in the rooms.

Cons:
1.  Not close to center strip, so depending on where you like the action, this might not be the hotel for you.
2.  The driveway entrance is a hazard.  Just waiting for an accident or the traffic guy to get nailed.  
3.  No soaking tub in standard rooms.  
4.  You can tell the hotel was renovated inside.  Not exactly the cleanest job, but not the worse.  
5.  The hotel lobby, casino area, and hall ways were kind of warm.  Need to crank up the AC more for common areas.

The so-called designer of valet parking should be fired immediately.  The place is no place for the elderly, or handicapped.  My friend just had back surgery, so we parked Valet.  It's fine on the way into the hotel.  Getting service inside the hotel, and especially on the way out to valet is another issue.

Who, in their infinite wisdom, would make the guest walk all the way to self park, just to wait for the valet?  Why not in front of the casino like REAL casinos do?  Nothing like making your handicapped guest walk all the way to self parking, just to waste more time waiting for valet to retrieve their vehicle.  If you couple this, with resort fees(THIS is a resort?) there's no reason to EVER patronize this place again.

I've seen there ads on TV, but there's nothing that will bring a person to return to this place.  This is why they are losing millions every quarter.  Give cash, and free play, not homes, and cars.  Hire FRIENDLY people who give your guests the service they deserve, not people who have the ""it's just a job"" attitude.  The only decent service is at the bar, as long as you are playing, and tipping.  800 degrees is the WORST.  Their so-called buffet was closed in no time...No wonder.  The Griddle didn't last long, either.  Good luck getting any service on the casino floor at all.  I've tried to give this place my money, and all they do is fail me.

You'll still find remnants of the Sahara here, as it appears that minimal construction was undertaken in rebranding the property.  In lieu of the massive dome that once signaled the entrance of the hotel, you'll now find a taxi queue encircling Philippe Starck's eye-catching sculpture called ""Saam.""  But, scattered throughout the casino floor, you'll find slot machines that still bear the insignia and name of the Sahara.  And, the hotel towers remain largely the same as before, though they've been given a heavy-handed makeover.  For better or for worse, the past remains very much a part of this futuristic - or, at the very least, forward-thinking - hotel.

The interior of the casino is undeniably stunning, reflecting the hotel's efforts to awe guests with food, technology, and design.  The main entrance features illuminated floor panels that change color in waves.  That color is reflected across mirrors that lined the walls and ceiling of the entryway.  Above the casino bar is suspended a massive 3D screen on which various mind-boggling images are projected.  Rows of dangling, exposed light bulbs line the mirror-laden ceiling of the elevator area.  (When the line for elevators was massive, the security guard told us that there were no stairs to access the upper floors of the different towers.  Safety hazard?)  And, there's undoubtedly much more that I didn't have the chance to uncover. Given these details, it's not surprising that the hotel was giving away free selfie sticks for signing-up for their loyalty program; after all, only the most humble person could resist taking a selfie in one of the hotel's numerous mirrors.

The hotel rooms continue the themes found elsewhere throughout the hotel: trendy, retro, futuristic. (Yes, that's a paradox.)  Since the decor varies from room to room, tower to tower, the following is my assessment of our room, which was located in the World Tower.  The room itself was shockingly small but given the illusion of space by massive mirrors that could be illuminated with the touch of a button.  To maximize space, the door to the clean, modern bathroom was hingeless; rather than swinging inward, the door slid along a track, much like a pocket door.  The sole window featured old-school metallic Venetian blinds with a roller shade emblazoned with various images.  In our case, this meant staring at the faces of a crowd of people - interesting but slightly unsettling.  Smaller than traditional doubles, the beds in our room barely fit two people.  Rollaways were out of the question, as the front desk informed us that they would not fit in the room.  And, to be honest, they probably wouldn't.  While everything seemed modern, I wondered how the room would look in several years when tastes change.  The stainless steel legs of the desk, the wallpaper, and the mirrors already made the room seem more tacky \/ dated than retro.

Despite its proximity to the MGM Festival Grounds, the SLS has little else going in its favor with regards to location.  The Encore, the nearest major resort (discounting Circus Circus and the Stratosphere), is approximately one mile on foot.  Although the monorail has a station at the SLS, it's probably not the best mode of transportation if traveling in groups given the cost per ride. Like other hotels on the Strip, however, self parking is free.  And, the lot is conveniently located next to the hotel, so walking in the heat can be kept to a minimum. 

That being said, the one redeeming quality of the SLS could possible be the quantity of interesting restaurants sprinkled across the hotel grounds.  The highlight is probably Jose Andres' Bazaar Meat, which features similar items to its sister restaurants in Beverly Hills and South Beach but specializes in meat.  Other trendy chains, like 800 Degrees, Umami Burger, and Katsuya, have locations here as well.  All of these, however, bear one thing in common: the inflated Las Vegas price.  The selection of restaurants definitely bolsters the hotel's credentials, but doesn't necessarily make it more ""foodie"" than any of the other hotels on the Strip.

Because the SLS is neither the most luxurious hotel on the Strip nor the most affordable,  I would not recommend staying here for your next Vegas trip.  You can easily find better quality hotels at a similar, if not lower, price that have a more ideal location.  Resist the urge for selfies and free selfie sticks!",6,4,2

Crazy wild party going on down at the pool with base we can feel on the 24th floor. They look like they're having the best pool party ever! Ha! We are glad to be back :)


First stay at sls:

This is a really beautiful hotel- a newer addition to the Starwood hotels (Sheraton, Westin, W, St Regis, etc.) I have stayed in suites at just about every hotel in Las Vegas and I can say that the also is the best deal I have found in Vegas, hands down.  I paid $139 per night, & was upgraded to the Luxe tower for being a platinum SPG member. I was given a handful of drink tickets as a courtesy, and breakfast vouchers for the Northside Cafe here in the casino.  

Checkin is in the back of the hotel- not in front on Las Vegas Blvd.  The valet guys were really helpful- One in particular, named ""Gator"" was about as friendly and helpful as you can be. He was so eager to help and was quick to let us know his name and that we could seek him out anytime if we needed anything. I appreciated this- most valets you see once or twice in the midst of a flash jog-by.  This guy took his time helping us out.

The hotel itself is lovely.  The front desk gentleman kindly gave me a history of the hotel explaining this was once the Sahara and shared a few interesting facts he had taken upon himself to learn. I love that Sinatra performed here! I also loved that this is a quieter hotel than most- definitely on the more elegant side. 

The rooms- I booked two rooms for myself and one for my mother and niece. Both were absolutely beautiful and while these were the regular rooms (not suites) they easily reminded me of the $1000\/night suites I've stayed in at Paris Hotel.  They are very large with Parisian style; fabric draped walls, Curtain covered Windows between the LARGE shower and main room- unique touch! Chandeliers, large mirrors (even a stylish mirror decor above the bed. Ooh la la!) The longest fainting couch I have ever seen stretched the length of the room.  Dual headed showers with rain faucet. Full size toiletries including dental and shaving kit. So many fine details that most hotels skimp on unless you are in the finest of suites- I am very pleased & so are my guests.


A few cons:  
- $25 a night for a mini fridge to be added to your room. I've never had Starwood charge me for a mini fridge before so that was odd & a little unexpected for this hotel considering they obviously don't skimp.
- lack of signage directing you to hotel registration. I got the feeling ""Gator"" had to give directions to registration at least a few dozen times a day! Good thing he had such a great attitude!
- The pool closes waaaaay early! At 6 pm, there was already a sign up that said come back at 9:30 am- it didn't say what time the pool closes. This is good that it keeps things quiet at least but do keep in mind this hotel has limited pool hours.


Overall, I am extremely pleased with this hotel and I have already booked another night here later in the week. Whoever is managing this hotel is doing a great job and I would love to hire their decorator!",12,2,4

When I worked at the Hilton I used to come to the Sahara to gamble and cash my check. Loved it. I loved the homey feel and the really cheesy decor.

Now:
My first time to SLS was for an industry invite to the then nightclub Life. Even though the nightclub scene is not my bag, I will always go where the promise of free beverages are :) The nightclub (now Foundry) had an odd but great setup. The drinks unimpressive although the service was fantastic. Definitely worth the trip. I'm happy they switched it to a concert venue, makes more sense for the space.

My second time to SLS was for a work event slightly closer in time. We had a dine around to try the property's restaurants. Had a fantastic time (appropriately full and boozed) and even was blessed with tickets to see The Cult. I gamble and hit a good machine, so unfortunately The Cult is still on the bucket list. 

A month or so later from the gaming I did that night I got an offer for some free play, food and a free room! I love free rooms.

Tonight as I drink a few beers before I gamble, this is my fourth (comp) stay here. I'm pretty sure this is my second time in this exact room.

I've always chose a smoking king and I think smoking comp rooms for my level (red card) are only in the World Tower and tenth floor.  No view although I don't really care, I live in Las Vegas and don't want to spend my evening staring out a window anyways.

Rooms:
King rooms in the World Tower are beautiful, very white and modern\/hip in decor. Large enough bathrooms, large enough bedroom, awesome mirrors and one of the best TVs I've ever had the pleasure of watching.

Every room has been immaculately cleaned. I even switched my room type at walk up today, from two queens to king so I very highly doubt I was in an inspected room. The only things that I noticed today in my room after doing ""the inspection"" were 1 eyelash probably from the housekeeper, missing ash tray and that the mini bar attendant didn't restock the $8 Jose Andres potato chips. Nothing to complain about at all.

The restaurants are great too. I actually love the Kung Pao Chicken from The Perk (The Cafe) which provides room service.

Service:
Shout outs to Savannah and Lauren for giving friendly and exceptional service at check in, thanks to Vanessa and Bryce? who assisted me as well from I believe Casino Marketing and to Chelsea at Bazaar for friendly service and some of the best Blood & Sands ever made. Everyone that works at ETC is awesome too.

Final:
Will definitely continue playing here and currently planning on booking a pay stay for Vegas Food and Wine next year.

Hotel Decor - The hotel is clean and nicely decorated.There's a beautiful scent when you walk in
Shuttle to the Airport - They have a van that makes pick ups & drop offs every hour. Complimentary
Monorail Access - The Las Vegas Monorail stops at SLS. It's faster (and cheaper) than taking a taxi across the strip. Takes you all the way to MGM Grand.
Pool - They have a private pool for hotel guests as well as the Foxtail pool for day partying.

I booked a 2 night stay through Priceline at a great price. By looking at the pictures of all the rooms I chose the World Tower and very glad I did.  I was aware of the resort fee cause well hello it's Vegas. Unless you're staying at Motel 6 expect to pay a resort fee. We arrived on Saturday October 24 at noon and figured we would check in and hope they had a room available. There was no line and were immediately checked in. I had originally booked a non-smoking room but we decided to change it to a smoking room and we were accommodated with no problem. Once again, I did my research so I knew that there was going to be a hold put on my credit card but was pleasantly surprised when I checked my bank account and was still able to use all my money. No  hold! Yay! The World Tower is located right by the entrance\/registration desk so no walk at all. I will say that the halls, as mentioned by some reviews are kind of creepy...but I'm a metal head so I actually thought it was kind of cool. Our room was on the 10th floor all the way at the end of the hallway which we liked. The ice machine was located right outside our room so that was cool as well. I had stayed at the Sahara before so I was aware that the rooms were on the smaller side so no surprise there. Our room was beautiful! Very modern. My boyfriend fell in love wit the decor...white and chrome. Bathroom was very beautiful, modern and spacious. Loved the light up mirrors and the super comfortable bed! Check-out was a breeze as well. Called the front desk at 10:50 and was able to get checked out with no problem. The resort fee was charged at that moment and a copy of my receipt emailed to me. 
 
All staff members were very friendly and helpful. We went to the Foxtail Nightclub on Saturday night and had lots of fun (separate review to come). After the club we asked if there was anything open to eat since we were drunk and starving. We were directed to some restaurant within the casino ( too drunk to remember the name). We ordered buffalo wings and fries which according to my boyfriend I thought were delicious lol and our bill was about $16. Wish we would have gone to the pool since the weather was perfect and yes it was open during our stay but we forgot our bathing suits. Next time. Valet was friendly and we didn't have to wait to long for our car. Oh and the casino smell great BTW. Not old and smoky like some of the other casinos.

We went on Hotwire to book (this was our first time using it) and chose a 4 star hotel in the north end of the strip. Looking on yelp, we saw some incredibly mixed reviews, so we were quite nervous going into our stay here.

We arrived on Saturday right before our check in which was at 3. We had driven over from Orange County, so parked in the parking structure which had plenty of spaces available.

Once we found check in, there was a pretty good sized line (not surprising since we were there at the typical check in time). The line moves pretty quickly. We get to the desk and are greeted by a male staff member (didn't get his name, but he has a Mohawk and glasses). He looks us up & tells us we're going to be in the story tower in a room with one king bed, and with no room for a pull out bed (there were 3 of us...). We asked if we could be in a double room, but he said they were all booked for the night. He offered to put us in the world tower in a bigger room with a king & room for an additional bed which he had sent up to the room. We really appreciated this! He offered to have us come back the next day to get into a double room, but we decided to just stay where we were. 

The room was super clean, cute & trendy, which was a theme that ran throughout the hotel. Lots of cool lighting, giant pictures, and different colored stripes throughout. 

We ordered room service from 800* the first night. $7 delivery charge, but it was worth it! Really yummy pizza & quick delivery. The next morning we had breakfast at The Griddle Cafe. Long line at 11am, but it moved really quickly. Biggest advice for this place, SHARE! We got the Saturday Morning something pancakes (Kaluha & Baileys mixed into the pancakes) & the ham\/eggs\/potatoes platter and shared between the 3 of us. We didn't even eat half the pancakes they were so big, but everything was delicious! We sat at the bar & the guys who were working were great, making sure we were taken care of & chatting when they had the chance. The first night we were there we got coffee from The Perq, it was fine, nothing crazy. 

Since the property is so far up the strip, we got a 24 hour monorail pass for $12. It was so worth it & allowed us to jump all around the strip. 

Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with SLS! It was inexpensive, clean, and really quiet. I would definitely come back!",3,0,0

What I cannot abide however, are the absurd resort fees.  I cannot wait for these not so hidden taxes to be legislated out of existence.  

You're charged for a room to stay on property, presumably eat and drink there, and then get charged for access to the pool, spa, gym, and landline phones whether you are going to use these things or not.  

I have a cell phone.  So does everyone else.  List the in house routing number and provide extension lists.  Or create an app so I can message the front desk, or housekeeping, or room service.  I don't need access to a landline.   

I also don't want to use the gym while I'm here.  If I did, I'd pay for it.  

Now let's get to the #1 so called benefit of resort fees.  In room wifi.   Well ok, perhaps I can pay for that but it's slower than AOL dialup from the 90's.  Load times are so bad on simple web pages that images don't load forever.  The wifi here is about as useful as reading glasses on a blind man.   

Offer useful wifi or stop charging for it.",9,1,1

I called asking for help getting my confirmation, and she refused to help me, gave me round about answers, and even had the audacity to tell me to call back in 2-3 weeks. If I called back then to confirm my reservation most likely there would be none left.  At this point I'm thinking that's so strange that she can't tell me whether or not I have a confirmed reservation, and if I didn't I needed to know so I could make another one.  Finally, she tells me I can call this other number to find out, which she could have saved me some time (and hers) and let me know that from the beginning.  I told her this and she began to get ugly, and announced that if I want to stay at THIS hotel then I will need to call back in 2-3 weeks.  ?!?!?!?!  I don't get it.

They have done a great job in appealing to young Vegas party goers who want to be seen and have a good time, but will not be spending absorbent amounts of time in their rooms or using hotel amenities, like the day spa. 

Rooms: The rooms here are immaculate! I am not sure if I have stayed in five star hotels that are quite this clean. The rooms have a modern theme with minimal clutter. Think chic New York studio apartment dressed in vibrant white. The bedding is extremely comfortable and each room has a very large flat screen T.V. The down size...if you book a room in the World Tower storage space and square footage is limited. The bathroom, though well appointed, is only big enough for one person to use at a time. There closet space is limited and there are not any drawers to store your clothing. I literally live out of my luggage for four days. Still, the housekeeping in this hotel available 24 hours a day, a plus if you like to sleep in, and truly does an excellent job!

Hotel: The hotel itself is also very clean and modern. They have made a good use of digital medial, vinyl art and window film to create a dynamic modern feel in each area of the hotel. Still, I found myself expecting more from the Starwood Group. Many areas of the SLS still feel like the old Saraha, even after a $415 million dollar renovation. The hallways leading to the rooms still have an old feel, even though they look brand new. The SLS is definitely not as big as other Vegas giants (hence the boutique). The hotel bar, pools, gift shop, casino and check in area are all near to one another, which can be a plus if you don't enjoy the long walk from amenity to amenity of other larger hotels. 

Overall, the service I received from the staff while at the SLS was superb. The team here is is professional and accommodating. What you would expect from Starwood Property, just with a lower guest to staff ratio, resulting in a longer wait at times in lines or for room service. The hotel is waking distance from the Las Vegas Convention Center and parking is very convenient on this property. There is also a monorail stop next to the hotel bar. 

If you are in Las Vegas for a conference at the convention center, or even a quick getaway, SLS Hotel & Casino is truly an ideal choice. While I was expecting a bit more from the hotel because it is a Starwood property, I still had an enjoyable stay and would absolutely return again if I need to be convention center close.

My trip was from July 9-12, 2015 and it was better than I expected. Since I booked a room at the SLS through BookIt.com, I got a great deal on the room plus free one-day monorail passes. When I took an Airline Shuttle from the airport to SLS, I didn't see that huge astronaut\/blubber looking statue, so I assumed that the shuttle driver dropped me off at the back entrance. I was kind of disappointed, but at the same time, it was ok since it wasn't that crowded.

Once I walked inside the SLS, there was this strong scent that filled my nostrils. I liked it at first because it was floral\/musty, but once I was already inside, the scent kind of gave me a slight headache. Hotels shouldn't smell like someone dumped a buttload of Bath and Body Works body sprays all over the place. The good thing, however, was that I got used to it after awhile. Anyway, wait time and checking in were fast, but for some reason, my hotel room was not ready. Pretty disappointing since I booked the hotel room through BookIt.com five months in advance, but the front desk associate told me a non-smoking room would be available and would call me in an hour. Thus, I decided to walk around the casino and looked at the restaurants. I never got a call within the hour, so I went back to the front desk and inquired about it. Sure enough, the room was ready.

My hotel room was at the World Tower, which was across from the check in desk, in an incredibly red hallway with a security guard wearing a red plaid coat and black pants. The front desk associate reminded me before I left to use my room key for the elevator, but I didn't know what he meant. I basically stood there, confused how to operate the button, until someone scanned his card on top of a black circle to activate it. Interesting, I thought. The elevator arrived and I noticed that there weren't any floors with the numbers 4 and 13. Maybe the owner of SLS believed in superstition? I finally reached the 17th floor and was surprised by the black, white, and pink walls. I have never seen decor like the ones at the SLS. Very modern and quirky.

Ultimately, I reached my hotel room, scanned my room key on the black circle on the door, turned the knob and walked inside. My first thoughts were wondering why the hotel room looked a lot smaller than on the photos I saw on the SLS website. The bathroom did not have a door with locks; Instead, there was a sliding mirror door separating the bathroom from the hallway\/bedroom. The closet space was rather small, but it did its job for me. There was a mini bar with a sensor, which was odd. I read on the pamphlet that if I were to take anything out of the mini bar, then I had 60 seconds to put it back. Doesn't that seem odd to you? Ok. Well. A small box of M&M's shouldn't cost $8 anyway. The main room consisted of a white couch in the corner, a silver tree stump, a standing silver lamp, two large mirrors on two sides of the room, a King sized bed, two silver nightstands on either sides of the bed, a large rectangular desk with a Samsung TV above it. The desk was really annoying because the top part was crooked and I literally tried moving it, but it was stuck at an angle. There were start buttons on either wall mirror, so I turned it on and four sides of the floor length mirror lit up. It definitely framed the room very well. The bed sheets, towels, and pillows were so soft. It was as if I was melting on a white cloud.

I took a look at the Foxtail Pool and it was very crowded. All seating areas were reserved. Not to mention, if you wanted to reserve a cabana, it would have cost $500. So...nope. Not worth it. Instead, I decided to go to the Lux Pool, which was just as relaxing.

Among the restaurants at the SLS, I tried Umami Burger, The Northside Cafe, and 800 Degrees Pizzeria. I ate at Umami three times and cherished each visit. The food was so delicious and filling. I am so enthused that there are two Umami Burger restaurants in San Francisco. I will definitely dine at one of those locations. The Northside Cafe was okay. 800 Degrees Pizzeria was spectacular. Pizzas were fresh out of the oven in a minute and the gelatos were so creamy.

My stay at the SLS was better than expected, except the intense scent that I mentioned above and the fact that it was UFC Fight Week. I was able to use the monorail passes during my stay, which was favorable, but the only downside to staying at the SLS was its distance from the strip. Regardless, the last monorail stop was next to the SLS, so it was unnecessary to walk toward the eventful part of the strip, if guests can alternatively use the monorail. It's only $12 for one day and you can use it within 24 hours. Overall, I would come back to the SLS if I were to visit Vegas again. The staff was friendly, prices were $$, and the entertainment was great!",2,0,0

From the moment you pull up to valet, there is someone who helps with your bags, accompanies you to check in and receive your room key, and escorts you directly to your room. Normally, at other hotels, there is multiple people for what one person does at SLS. I think this creates a connection between staff and the visitors in the hotel. On multiple occasions my partner and I were recommended great locations to dine at.

I have had the pleasure of staying here on two different occasions, the first time in the World tower and the second time in the Story tower. As much as I wanted to like the Story tower with all of the renovations of the old Sahara, I just couldn't find myself enjoying the small industrial looking room. I'm not even sure the off centered ceiling mirror could keep me there a moment longer. On that specific occasion I found myself asking to be placed into the World tower just as we experienced in our first stay and we absolutely loved both stays! The rooms are a little larger and so are the restrooms. I love the double mirrors that make the room appear a little larger and they're just perfect lighting for applying makeup (not to mention taking photos). 

The rooms are absolutely adorable as they come with wine bottle openers, shaker bottles to make your own mixed drinks (I definitely made use of this!) and so many more cute little amenities you didn't even realize you could use. I even find it absolutely smart how there is a black makeup towel labeled ""makeup"" so that the white towels don't get stained. 

Pool: It's sexy for sure! It's a great place to lounge around, catch a few rays, and tan! I love the mirrors on the side of the pool... now that I think about it, I wish I took a picture of that!

Restaurants: Their restaurants are delicious. SLS gave us a $10 voucher to dine and we couldn't pass up the opportunity to dine in their fabulous restaurants. I'm from Los Angeles where we have all of the ones in Vegas but I think the service here is on point! If you're looking for something quick and fast I would highly recommend Umani just because you know you'll get a great burger but I can personally vouch for how good their quick and enthusiastic service. 

Casino: Although I only know how to play roulette, I love just hanging around here and playing for a while. Even though we always tend to lose, I have so much fun doing so haha! Drinks are always coming around so I never feel I'm left unattended to and most of the casino employees are pleasant. 

Back when this was the Sahara hotel, I promised myself I would never return but since then the SLS has far exceeded my expectations with their amazing hospitality and wonderful customer service. On my last visit, I made several changes to my reservations their concierge accommodated me each and every time. The SLS is just a perfect fit for what I'm looking for in a Vegas hotel stay.",1,0,0

The hotel itself was pretty clean and modern. Check in was easy, the decor and furniture was very posh, and the staff was pretty kind. The pool party was great! They played hip hop and top 40 and even had guests such as T-Pain and Busta Rhymes. There's also a casino downstairs if you're feeling lucky. 

The room itself was pretty cozy and clean! The bathroom was beautiful and so was main room area. I guess you could say the rooms are somewhat small but they were perfect for us. We stayed in the World Tower by the way. The last time I stayed in this area at the Westgate (formally LVH), I was disappointed in how old the hotel was and the lack of service.

My boyfriend and I decided to stay at the SLS for the weekend to celebrate his birthday, him being signed to a manager, and my passing of an important test. We picked the SLS because we wanted to be a little further away from the Strip, it looked modern and chic, and most importantly the price was right. 

The SLS Las Vegas has lost $35 million dollars in their first quarter and now it's apparent as to why. There were things about the hotel that weren't ideal, but that could be overlooked while we were there. 1.) The shower didn't drain. 2.) Our room key didn't work at one point. 3.) The fact that while being out of our room for numerous hours, and coming back at 5PM, and still finding out that our room still hadn't been cleaned. 4.) The rude security guard at the Foxtail Pool who mocked me for asking a simple question. ALL of these things I was able to forgive, however, after what happened in my last hour, I cannot overlook the hotel's blatant inadequacies any more. 

While parked in THEIR hotel's garage, I went back to my car and noticed that not only had my car's back window been completely shattered, but that our stuff had been stolen. When talking to hotel security, I was then told that they had no security cameras in their garage. Mind you, Las Vegas hotels spend exorbitant amounts of money on security cameras and guards. For example, when entering their pool area, my boyfriend and I were stopped by a security guard asking us for our room key and IDs, and then right after, another security guard prompting us to empty our pockets and ready to physically search us. There were at least 10 security guards at the pool alone. HOWEVER, they only had one security guard riding around on bike in the hotel's garage where their ""respected"" guests park. Clearly, their money and property is more important than their guests.  

Instead of them trying to help me (offer me a ride to the police station, escort me to a room to make necessary phone calls, comp my stay, help me clean the glass away from my car's path, offering a sincere apology, etc) they let me know that I parked at their parking garage at my own risk and that they were not accountable AT ALL. Which I get. I do. I trusted a well-known hotel with my car. I was wrong to trust the SLS, and honestly neither should you. 

After reporting this crime, I have yet to hear from a hotel representative to see how me, my boyfriend, or my car is doing, and I doubt I will. I spent a lot of money at this hotel, and was a good guest, the least they could do is show me the same amount of respect. But perhaps that's asking too much. I have never been so insulted in all my life. It's one thing if this happened at a Motel 6, but this happened at a well respected, well-known hotel- SLS Las Vegas, you could've fooled me. Next time, I'll just take my chances and stay at a Motel 6, I'm sure it would be worth the risk.

Rooms:
- First thing I thought when I walked in.  SMALL.  SO, SO, SMALL.  There were 2 of us in one room and we felt cramped.  
- LOVED the mirrors...mirrors everywhere (which was probably used to make the room seem bigger).  I like the full length lighted mirrors.  If this hotel goes down...I would buy those off of craigslist.  :)
- I do love how white\/clean everything looked.......but I got over that real quick.
- In the middle of our stay, the electricity in our bathroom was out for about 20 mins.
- The water went out at our friends room (mid-shower). When she called downstairs, it seemed like they didn't know how to resolve the issue. ""We'll put you in a new room"" to sending up someone to fix it, then saying ""nevermind, its the whole tower""...kind of frustrating.
- I called downstairs to ask for a thin blanket.  The guy said they don't have blankets and just have flat sheets and that he can send one up.  I thought that was weird and said OK.  Then they sent up a blanket (like the one I wanted).  I opened it up and LINT EVERYWHERE!!!!!!  Every time we touched the blanket, stuff would be in the air.  Put the blanket in the corner and didn't even use it. 
- I forgot to note that on Saturday morning, I was woken up by some noise from the street down below at 5am.  From 5a to about 11a, it was non-stop.  I wasn't sure what it was, but it sounded like a wave....SO ANNOYING (especially cuz I was hungover).  I also like to wake up to a DARK DARK room and there were no curtains!  FAIL.

Casino:
Cheap tables!  I like that!  Hahaha.  The casino smelled fruity..not sure what it was.  Not bad....

Restaurants:
Had a couple of my favorites from LA:  Griddle, Cleo, Umami, 800 Degrees (I didn't try these restaurants here, but if the quality is as good as the ones in LA, that would be a plus).  I also wanted to try the SLS Buffet, but didn't get around to it.  Heard it was pretty good.   
Ku Noodle:  Food was tasty but pretty pricey for dimsum\/chinese food.  
Perq:  Nice quick place to get coffee and gelato on the go.  

Pool:  Area looked nice but I didn't go swimming.

Sayers Club:  Went briefly around 2am to just dance into the night.  The music was good.  Apparently, Vegas doesn't play hip hop anymore because ""it causes trouble"".  This place had a good mix and not just edm.

Overall:  I most likely won't stay here again.  It's too far from the rest of the strip and it does not offer anything to compensate for that.  I would possibly come back for the restaurants, but most likely not.",8,4,2

I made SLS Hotel Las Vegas my home for 8 days and covered 2 conferences across a few sectors, managed to shop one day and see friends on the weekend. 
Let's define home to me: I am a 42 year old international first class business woman requiring the best of foods, service, fitness, spa, attitudes and quiet from my room for peaceful rest moments. Basically, I am a mild diva with a smile; demanding nevertheless.
SLS Hotel Las Vegas went out of their way to make me feel special from the time I arrived until the time I left and lets not forget when they cheered me on via text when I finally took a day off to go shopping and have some fun. Adorable!
The restaurants are the BEST in Vegas, hands down, the BEST. The kind of places you go to with friends on the weekend and not ""cheesy"" Vegas like but ""cool"" different, sexy and you always want more. I love CLEO for casual and call the bar staff the A-team because there are three bartenders that work in tandem, no drama and they make you want to stay. I love them and Cleo has Brussels sprouts and venison sausage. Done, love it.
Bazaar is AMAZING...the service and food, words cannot describe. I went with my best girlfriend but really look forward to snuggling up with a proper date in a booth and eating and drinking and being merry VERY SOON.
The salon and spa are amazing, SMALL but doable and the manicure I got two weeks ago is still on. Really.
SLS has something special, its an unusual and innovative little mini-city amongst all of the other mini-cities in Vegas but SLS is more like a mini beach town city on the coast of somewhere chic. It is not flashy at all; its glamorous but glitter free.
I recommend this place for private stays and or small intimate business gatherings and definitely for locals for dinners . . .easy parking and valet and there is a VIP very private drop off around the back.

We called down to the front desk and got hung up on twice. After requesting new glasses and waiting about an hour they never came. The bathrooms were cheaply restored in fact the whole room looks like a college dorm. There are no closets or drawer space so if you are visiting for several days you may be living out of your suitcase. The room service also was not detail oriented. They didn't replace used items in the room. For $200 a night NOT worth it at all, you are better off at the Bellagio or Wynn. 

Casino & Restaurants: this is where they spent the money. $5 and $10 minimum tables were great. The Center Bar had an amazing bar tender that made the greatest Margarita on the Rocks. We are The Griddle Cafe and although they said a wait of 45 minutes it was much less. The service at the cafe was great even with it being packed and the food was delicious. You get a lot for your money and huge portions. I've also heard great reviews on the steak house although we didn't eat there during our visit. The security at the hotel was also on top of things, checking IDs and room keys and making sure everything on the floor was in order.",3,0,0

This was my 4th time staying here since at the SLS las Vegas and couldn't be more happier and excited to check in. My bf and i were in town just for 24hrs for a friends birthday during halloween weekend, and this time we were had a room on the Storyteller side. The room was a bit on the smaller side but for two people, hey it was fine. The floor that we stayed on sucked because room service told us that our floor had no Ice Machine (no problem) so then we asked if we can have ice sent to our room. About 30-40 mins passed and I noticed we had not received it and we were about to walk down to leave the room soon. Called room service and she said they never told anyone to bring up ice... and that instead we can walk down to Perq to get a bucket of ice. Brushed it off since we weren't going to be in our room long... 

Everything was fine most of our stay up until check out... I'd have to say that the front desk women was completely rude. My bf wanted to check out and pay with His CC since i had to put incidentals on mine when we checked in. Basically couldn't do it even though we hadn't checked out and didn't for that reason because the night before we asked if we could have extended check out, which we were approved till 1pm. he explained that to her that we had extended check out (we didn't even use the entire extended stay) and the brat at the front desk said ""well its already been charged to the card"" and disregarded him. 

I got so Irritated hearing what had happened. I've had more pleasant experiences even at some of the older run down las vegas hotels.  Unfortunately my bf did not get her name or complain to management while we were still there for the day. He was just letting this pass and hopefully this wont happen next time... 

So we shall see next time if we EVER come back to stay at this hotel. Two stars for accessibility and not even requesting anything complicated and for such rude service upon check out...",1,0,1

Wow, we really experienced a lot of attention and great service from the staff. I  don't know if it was because we stayed on a Monday week night and the hotel and casino was dead? I am hoping the staff is always this Amazing and that the service is consistent and stays good years from now. 

It was my birthday and they really spoiled me and kept the drinks flowing while I was playing cleopatra keno. I later stumbled up to the room, anyways lol. 

I enjoyed this small hotel and casino,  my room was beautiful and all we needed. My room was seductive and we all know I LOVE SEXY. A great spot to do a sexy photo shoot for sure! I really enjoyed my shower with the rain fall shower heads.  

I will be back to enjoy another fun night stay for sure!. This is my new favorite find on the strip!

I stayed here based on an offer I received from their Code Play for 2 free nights and $15 free play. I figured this was due from spending a lot of money at their casino in one trip in last November. It's just that NOW they send this to me when other casinos send me stuff the month after my trip and I really didn't expect to get anything from them. I can reuse this offer in August and September which is pretty good but, it also tells me one thing that they need people there for their off season in summer. Or maybe, which would be good in my favor, they really need business because their casino is not bringing in money. Casinos survive on people playing their games and they're new and haven't built a reputation in gaming. Their reputation has not been built because the hotel appeals to the millennial crowd but, millennials don't gamble much. Luckily for them, this millennial likes to gamble but, their casino is hit or miss for me. It's typical pay out of the strip but, not for the area since it is north of the strip. North strip casinos are supposed to pay out more towards 90% like if you went to Stratosphere then you would be able to compare your luck and see the difference. The re-vamp could have something to do with it but, I might add the pay out is a little bit better here than Tropicana in which, they got their ""hip"" revamp and their the machines are tight. I like the atmosphere of the casino and it doesn't make losing money that much of a depressing burden. Not a lot of people play there unless it's a weekend at night then you see a lot of people drinking and playing. It's becoming more of a local's casino which is good because the payouts will get better but, the casino will loose money on the other millennial activities such as clubs and dining and that will dwindle off and change rapidly. SLS be more like Aria and don't show boat too much in where, you get desperate. Keep your casino classy but, you're going to have to appeal to older money if you want money. 
Now, the rooms. I liked my room in the world tower. I didn't find it to be too small or awkward. I didn't like the a\/c at all. It was really hot in my room and the vent was in the worst spot. 
The staff was really friendly! I was not expecting that at all. I wish I ate at one of the restaurants or went in the pool but, I was busy doing other things and I ran out of money. 
If I get the offer again (what am I talking about...I am) I would consider staying here.",0,1,0

The casino itself smells amazing. I always love how Las Vegas hotels smell. The SLS here really stuck in my mind along with Vdara.
It's ways away from the hustle and bustle of the Las Vegas Strip, but the monorail is right next door and it can take you into the strip quickly for only $5 each way.

My boyfriend and I didn't get to try out the pool area, because it was raining the weekend we were there. 

The front desk let us check-in early and there is self-parking available for those who do not want to valet their vehicles.

Small and cozy with modern decor. Staff here was very friendly. The vibe here is also good, they are trying to attract a young crowed. I don't know how this strategy will work out as young people do not have lots of money to blow. Back to my room, the shower worked great and that's important plenty of water and room.

Con;

Sad to say while I was playing the machines on our second day there I had to call the beverage manager to the floor and proceed to have a 15min conversation with her about the comp drinks not coming around fast enough if not at all. She was very receptive to my concern and also witnessed the waitress as a no show for the time she was talking to me and addressed the waitress on the spot.

I was comped as a guest here and would say I'd have to check prices online to determine if I would stay here again. There's just to many options in Vegas these days and a hotel has to do something special to stand out.

Right now, I'm staying mid-week as a break before a busy travel schedule.  My World Tower King room was $74\/nt plus $25 'resort fee' and $150\/night 'hold'.  Paying double to 'hold for incidentals' is exorbitant.  
PROS:
 Small casino that is easy to navigate.  
 Friendly staff, esp Joe from VA in the Griddle.  Portions are HUGE.  Sit at the bar for faster seervice.
 800 Degree pizza!
 I drive to Vegas so this is easy to get to from the freeway.  As others have mentioned, do NOT go to the main entrance but around the back, as it is closer to the hotel check-in.
 On the monorail line so it's easy to zip around the Strip and cheaper than a $20 cab ride from the Four Seasons.
 Casino bars are friendly as is the hotel staff.
 Pretty loose slots in the casino.
 My room has loads of plugs and USB ports.
 Plenty of food choices within the property.
 The room key also operates the elevator.  Nice added bit of security there.

CONS:
 Surprising number of penny, 2 cent, 5 cent and dime machines for the Strip.  Not my speed and drew an older crowd during the week.  Very small high roller area.
 My room did not look like any of the pictures on the website.  No drawers...at all!  Three small shelves by the front door is all you get.  Not even a basket for the shelf.  Since I don't want to leave my underwear out, I lived out of my suitcase for privacy.
 Supposedly there was supposed to be a robe and slippers in the room.
 When I arrived on Tuesday afternoon, there was an empty glass outside my door that stayed there until Wednesday night.
 Where the heck are the ice machines on each floor?
 Returning from dinner on Wednesday night, there was a strong smell in the hallway (almost like a skunk).  Luckily, it wasn't in my room and gone the next morning.
 This is not kid friendly, unless you don't mind your kids finding the 'intimacy box' with condoms, lube and a vibrator next to boxes of $8-12 snacks.

I'm a local and have visited plenty of properties. I hope that people really give this property a chance. Launching a project as big as this is hard and they've been at for one month. Yes, they have some things to work out, but they have also brought some amazing new additions to our city that make it better. I don't gamble, so I have zero feedback for gaming, but I have spent plenty of time here and think it's a great experience for the money. 

PROS:

1. Great restaurant portfolio. 
Cleo has an amazing mediterranean menu, Katsuya has delicious sushi, The Griddle Cafe has the best french toast EVER and Bazaar Meat is a carnivore's extravagant playground. (Bazaar Meat is crazy expensive, but that darn gin an tonic and meal were absolute perfection.) We also ate at Ku, which was very overpriced for the quality of the food, but everywhere else was terrific. 

2. Clever room design. 
Yes, the rooms are smaller than most hotels on the strip. These aren't suites like Encore or palatial studios like the Venetian\/Palazzo, but they provide more than enough room for 2 people and they did a smart job maximizing every inch of the space. (Light up wall mirrors, sliding bathroom door and a pull down window shade that gives the illusion of a headboard. Yes, the view isn't great, but I don't spend a lot of time staring out of the window in my hotel room. If I want an amazing view, I go to the Mandarin Oriental's bar for the best view on the Strip. 

3. Switch up valet.
I love that I can valet my car in the front of the hotel and pick it up from the back or the front depending on which direction I am headed at the end of the night. 

4. Sahara and LVB location
I love that it's easy to get in and out of this property. 

5. Sayer's Club
I LOVE this place. It's cool and if you go on a sessions night then be prepared for a late night music show that you'll never forget. We saw an incredible act that was a delightful surprise on a Thursday night. 

CONS

1. Service at the pool. 
It was terrible. Truly the worst pool service I have ever experienced in Las Vegas. The waitresses would pick and choose who they waited on -- luckily the bartender was terrific and the pool restaurant menu was the best in town. So as long as you don't mind going to the bar to get your drinks, then you're good.

2. Check in desk. 
If you get dropped off at the front of the property you have to haul all your luggage to the check in desk at the back. Quick tip: If you have a lot of luggage ask to be dropped off at the Paradise entrance. 

3. Check in process
Oy vey. I had to wait forever and my room key didn't work so I had to go back down to the front desk 2x to get a new room key.

4. Self parking garage
There is no signage for which direction to go and there is an exit process where you have to cross lanes of valet traffic. Better signage and stop signs would help. 

5. Everything is LOUD
I love music as much as the next person, but I had a work meeting at Perq and the Griddle Cafe and we literally had to yell at each other. This town needs a quiet place for locals to meet in central Las Vegas and I quickly learned that I should never plan a work meeting at an SLS restaurant.  

I chalk the cons up to being a new property and needing to train the heck out of their people. I plan on going back in the next few weeks and maybe they will get 5 stars.",3,3,0

The rooms are all very small and very plain, just incredibly underwhelming. The really cool previews that you get on the Internet do not look anything like the actual room when you get up there. From a customer service standpoint, this hotel does not do a good job. I did not need to hear, at check-in today, that they were sold out last night and so rooms are still not ready even though check-in is at 3 PM and I am there at 4 PM. They did not even have the availability of an upgrade which I would have gladly paid for even if it was way more expensive. 
The view is pitiful and I have been here, to stay, three times which is why I am confident in placing this review at this point. What the hotel wins at is restaurants: they have really good places to eat downstairs. As a local, coming here to eat is great because I can just go home after. I chose to get a room tonight because they're having a massive food and wine event and, as I'm sure I will plan on consuming some beverages, driving is not an option. Sadly, the fact that the event is now at this hotel is not so great as I have stayed in the Luxe tower and the story tower... The story tower tells absolutely no story and the luxe tower is all white wash with absolutely nothing to call luxury.
It is very unfortunate because I really wanted this hotel to be fabulous, but yet again I'm disappointed. 
I asked for a king bed and because they had no rooms available, I accepted a double bed room and the double beds are very uncomfortable.
In the future, should there be an event at this hotel, I will choose to stay at a hotel nearby and just walk over. This is a big disappointment for any Las Vegas local who knows the best of the best in hotels, which Las Vegas has plenty of. I only gave this place two stars because I do not plan on staying in a room again at this hotel.
To add on, if you plan on dining in the room, there are two choices of places you can order from, and one is 800° for pizza. I don't get it. It was very average and I would not order the pizza again. We wanted more soft drinks in the refrigerator as there were barely any and we called guest services who transferred us to front desk who transferred us to some service that would help... Yet nobody ever answered. Just poor customer service.",2,0,0

I have been following them and hope to stay in Miami next year and the new location they are opening in the caribbean soon! 

What is SLS - anything you want it to be:  Perhaps, a ""Smooth Lazy Sunday""...this sounds good for brunch! I love the quaint size of the hotel (formerly the old Sahara that was renovated basically from the ground up minus the framework). The attention to detail and Phillip Starck design is one of a kind! 

The 5 Best Things Here:
1. Details and Design (how about that scratch and sniff wall paper and mirrors on the ceilings in some rooms)?
2. Ciel Spa (all white decor and some of the best treatments I've had in a hotel\/resort setting). 
3. Anything...Jose Andres (my favorite chef in America focused on modern tapas and molecular gastronomy...this is serious stuff...his place here is called MEAT...if you love meat you will love it!
4. SLS Las Vegas has a beer garden on the strip and it has great food and craft beers attached to my favorite lounge for live music, ""The Sayers Club"". 
5. There are always cool things to discover within SLS (think of it as a scavenger hunt) and this is at each of their hotels. It's like a large adventurers club...from the pool to the hidden sex shop.

There is no ice machine in the whole tower. How do you not have an ice machine? When I called to ask front desk where the ice machine was, they stated that they have to bring you up ice upon request.

1. Paid $2k for a cabana at the pool only to get food poisoning from their swordfish sandwich, my $500 glasses were stolen, and the mister didn't even work in our cabana so it was even hotter than normal.  Really rude guy named SAMI T. at the front of the club that treated us horribly and literally like cattle. D
The only highlight was AMBER our cocktail waitress - she was probably the best employee in that hotel. 


2  Room keys NEVER EVER worked. So many instances where we would go upstairs exhausted at 4am only to have to go back down to get another key and then to go back up and see it wasn't working. 

3. Worst ever was the food poisoning. I had to go to ER the next day because I was sick the entire night. 

4. No poker room. Yes I repeat - there was no poker room in a casino in Vegas. Huge dumb mistake. We ended up gambling at Wynn the entire time. 
5. Staff didn't know anything. You'd literally ask them where is their Lost and found and hear ""I don't know"". Not even a response of ""let me find out"". I understand you just opened but this is a HUGE indication that the staff training was VERY poor and deficient. Invest more in preparing your staff. 
  

Bottom line - the staff is poorly trained and treat the guests like cattle.  Food was generally good with the one HUGE exception with the food poisoning. I do think sBE should just stick to restaurants and clubs. This is way out of their league and poorly poorly executed. I will never ever ever stay anywhere besides Wynn again.

We parked on the Paradise Rd side of the garage and had no issues getting to the front desk for check-in.  One elevator in the parking garage was down, but the other one was in working order for the duration of our stay.  Check-in was quick and easy, and the front desk attendant, MJ, was very friendly and inviting.  Staff opened doors for us and were very helpful all weekend.  We loved our room and I didn't think it was small at all.  There was definitely enough space for the two of us and all of our luggage.  The rain head on the shower was great and I found the bathroom to be very clean and sleek.

1. Upon checking in, we asked them for a fridge for our room because my cousin's medication needed to be chilled. Four calls to the front desk and six hours later, we finally got a fridge. No apology for the delay or anything. They said it was our fault because they never saw an ""order put in."" Wtf. 

2. The desk lamp popped when we were doing our makeup to go out. Not the lightbulb, but the lamp itself. How does that even happen? A lot of smoke started to come out of the lamp.

The detail was not good. Crooked tiles on the ground. (some missing grout) watered down OVERPRICED drinks ($16 for small bacardi-coke) DJ Pete Tong couldn't even keep the place alive. Tables start at $550. Half of them were still empty all the way through the night. 
For a ""grand opening"" night. It was a flop. The place started to get crowded around 12 midnight, then literally people started leaving at about 1:30 am in droves. The rumblings of disappointment were obvious.

The service checking in was slow, granted there was confusion with my cards since the original reservation was booked for me as a gift. I don't mind that it took awhile for them to figure out what needed to be done but not once did anyone apologize for the wait.

The casino floor is cramped and there's a weird path next to foxtail that suddenly ends into the casino floor leaving everyone confused and cramped as you try to make your way out of the slots.

Host Stephen was very helpful and even called my room after a small SNAFU to make sure everything had been taken care of.

I had so much fun at the table, it was hard to walk away.

The room was very comfortable (I got upgraded to a suite for my entire stay, even though I had only booked the suite for the third day. Thanks to the front desk staff for that).

Had dinner at BAZAAR MEAT, and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. Try the croquetas de pollo and the braised beef cheeks. The famous Foie Gras Cotton Candy was one of the most interesting things I've ever tasted, but I'm still not sure how to describe it. Umami Burger is also stellar.

Cons:
The line to check-in and out is horrendous. Also, the valet and parking garage on Las Vegas Blvd. is very far from the front desk, which makes a weary traveler much wearier. Use the entrance off Paradise. It's right next to the concierge and check-in.

I had never heard of this hotel until I rolled the dice and booked a stay through the name your own price feature on Priceline.

The clean, quiet and comfortable room had a wonderful view and an amazing bed.  Taxed resort fees amounted to roughly $30+ dollars a day, but internet was included.  The Foxtail pool area was a welcome retreat on a scorching weekday afternoon, and while the cabanas and certain tanning beds were available by reservation only, there were plenty of places to stretch out in both sunny and umbrella shaded areas.  By comparison, the upstairs Lux pool seemed tiny and crowded.   

The staff was friendly and outgoing at all hours throughout my stay.  Security personnel were present at the entrances to the parking garages, the pool and the main floor elevator corridors.

Stayed here 5\/7 and 5\/8 for a conference. Got a room block rate, but not sure I'd come back at the full price of ~$300\/night. They are clearly targeting 20- and 30-somethings here. Top 40 music blaring overhead, Victoria's Secret like smell wafting throughout and funky decor. Staff was very nice and courteous all around. Also dined at Cleo and Northside Cafe and wrote separate reviews for those. 

As far as the overall theme\/decor of this place--I think they are confused. It's a combination of retro photos, goth, monkeys, Woodstock and an Alice in Wonderland rabbit hole type hallway in the meeting room area. There's also a very weird mirrored lobby level elevator area (World Tower) that could be dangerous after a few cocktails. They need to pick a theme and stick to it.

Guest rooms:

Pros:
- Great drink and snack selection in mini bar, though overpriced as expected
- Nice sized room and bathroom
- Great shower head and water pressure
- Modern feel
- Comfy beds\/pillows
- Flattering lighting :)

Cons:
- No coffee maker
- No fridge that you can use (only one to house mini bar contents)
- Very thin, drafty windows. I was on the 16th floor and could hear everything on the street
- No rubber grip on bottom of bathmat--very slick
- No toiletries except bar of hand soap and lotion. They should offer additional items considering what you pay to stay here.
- Room numbers are weird\/confusing
- Desk chair is uncomfortable
- No dresser\/chest

When we were checking out, we were told that we got the 25% off not 50. After negotiating with staff, they comped us the $25 resort fee as credit to use in the casino... Thanks for nothing, we were checking out and weren't planning to spend any more in this hotel. I must say that the room was clean, shower was great, and bed was comfortable. The bathroom entry had a cheap shower curtain instead of a door, where if not careful you'd get hit in the head with the handle every time you entered.

I'll go into more detail below, but to summarize, it was impossible to get clean towels in our room, the casino, pool, and restaurants were devoid of people and energy, and the location was too far from the strip and very inconvenient. I only recommend this hotel to young people who need a cheap option and don't care about gambling. 

Towel Disaster: 
No one cleaned our room Saturday. This is understandable, as we were in and out all day and I'm assuming housekeeping tried to come clean the room during the few times we were in the room. Saturday night, I called Guest Services at 5:15pm for towels. They weren't coming, so I ended up showering and drying off with the one clean towel that we had which was a tiny hand towel. I called guest services again and was told towels were coming. Then, my friend called housekeeping and was told towels were on the way. Finally, at 6:45pm my husband called housekeeping and was very stern (as my friend and I had been getting nowhere by politely requesting towels). He was told that towels were on the way. Finally, at 7:15pm, TWO HOURS after I had first called for clean towels, I walked down to the front desk. The girl at the front told me that no towel request had been made and that the ""only way to put a request in the system is through me at the front desk."" I told her I had called guest services twice and housekeeping twice. She said they aren't able to do requests. I asked her if that meant the four people I talked to had been lying when they said towels were on the way and she said yes!! So basically, in order to get clean towels at the SLS (a very very basic hotel request), a guest has to physically walk down to the front desk? Finally, after I had walked down to the front desk, we got our towel delivery. Our group had to shower extremely quickly and we barely made our reservation at STK (which was amazing, everything about the Cosmo is wonderful, the SLS should take note). 

Dead Atmosphere:
On top of our problems with towels, the casino had a very dead and lackluster atmosphere the entire time we were there. The tables weren't full and there wasn't any of the fun screaming and yelling and happiness that you normally see in casinos. 

We went to Katsuya on Friday night and while the food and service was wonderful, the restaurant atmosphere was also devoid of fun. No one was eating in the restaurant. I feel bad they have to operate out of this hotel, because the food was great. 

The hotel pool was also dead, but that was kind of nice. We went to the rooftop ""family pool"" and since no one was there, we got to sit on a couch in the shaded areas for free, so that was kind of nice. Normally the places I go to in Vegas charge money to sit in locations like that, so the dead atmosphere actually worked in our favor here. I didn't go to Foxtail, so I can't comment on whether that was any better. 

Pro:
Everyone I talked to at the front desk was really nice (even the woman who helped me with the towel disaster, I obviously didn't like the information she was relaying, but she did it in a very nice and courteous way). 

The checkout process very quick. The line at the front desk moved very fast and the man who checked us out was very quick and nice. I had wanted to checkout on the TV, but that wasn't possible as there was no remote control for the TV in our room.

Their gift shop, Etc., is open 24 hours. All of the cashiers at Etc. were very nice and friendly. 

Overall, I won't stay here again. I'm going to stick with Cosmo\/Aria. The SLS has some great prices, but for me, it's not worth the cost savings.",1,0,0

Man, this hotel and casino has been getting killed in their reviews.

The Ugly
I don't know what they were thinking when they designed the hallways of the World Tower.  It looks like something out of a mad house.  The walls have this black paint or anything giving it a Halloween horror nights  feel to it.  The rooms, however, have a different  decorto the hallways. They actually don't look bad.  Another ugly thing about the casino is that the entrance sidewalk is painted white. Bad mistake as it already looks dirty.  Third, the buffet hallway was something from a dark circus or something.  Walls are white with black stripes everywhere.  Fourth, the security staff has to wear these ugly uniforms that remind me of a Scottish kilt.  Why not have them wear black blazers?

The Bad
The restaurant food was decent for the most part, but damn was it expensive.  I ate at the ku noodle place and the food was not worth the price.  The umi burger place, although it was good, was expensive too.  My favorite places were the pizza place and griddles.    The food was good.  Besides the food, the valet guys were complete assess with other people's cars. I parked in the structure close to the valet and I would see these guys burning out with customers cars.  I'm glad I didn't valet.

The Good
My room was nice and very comfortable. I had a nice bed and a good tv inside. I like that the clubs were close to the gambling area so I saw nothing but hot ladies all night.  The cocktail waitresses are 9s and 10s too.  For the most part the staff was friendly and the concierge was hot too.  All the people and the restaurants were attentive to our needs.  I had a good time gambling there.

Despite some bad reviews and EXTREMELY low pricing I figured all would be fine. However we should have been more cautious. First of all we stayed in the World tower, 8th Floor with a window facing a parking lot and there was really loud music playing somewhere that just pounds into the room all through the night. We had to download a white noise app on the I-phone to keep on all night to drown out the pounding music. Next thing was all the staff kept telling us we must try Bizaar Meats and telling us how insane good it is. So being foodies we were very excited to try! Place looks great but be aware of EXTREMELY high prices, a 1 hour made to order cook time and fair food. For a starter we had shrimp and crab cocktail, which was very good but so small and near $40 dollars, then we had an anti-pasta sampler of cured meats, which was served on a small cutting boards and that was $60. The Really amazing tomato bread that is recommended to go with the cured meats was and additional $12!  For our main course we wanted a filet of some sort and were told they only have Kobe and its $30 and Ounce, so for a 6oz. would be $180. So we opted for another cut that we could share. This was $65 a pound and we were told the only had 2.5 Lb or more. When took the 2.5Lb and it was a huge bone and LOTS of fat and a tiny amount of meat,l not worth $165. lastly I wanted mashed potatoes and although it says it on the menu its very literal. It Butter butter more butter and a splash of potato! was pure butter and the Brussels sprouts were so vinegary I didn't eat them.  So basically we had an ok dinner with 2 glasses of wine and spent $500. But here is the real reason for 1 star! We took a long flight from NY to get to Vegas and so we both brought out Beats By Dre $400 per pair of Studio Pro headphones for the plane. When we got to the room we just put them in their proper bags they came with and then inside a shopping bag and left them on the couch, knowing we wouldn't need again until we flew home. Well We came back to our room to find the headphones were stolen and who ever took them (housekeeping) thought it would be cute to leave the spare cord out on display making sure we knew they were gone. $800 worth gone! We had just bought those at the Apple store and are not happy! We filled a report and an investigation they say is going on, but they made sure to let us know that because they offer a safe in the room that we should have used, they have not responsibility for them. Will never go back! Be warned you CAN NOT trust their housekeeping!",2,1,0

ZERO STARS.""), but I'm going to have to pile on a bit as well.

My biggest pet peeve by far was found in my room. The room itself was mostly fine. Nothing crazy impressive and kinda small compared to what you find as a standard at most places nowadays, but it did the job, even if I could very clearly see how the old Sahara construction was still evident in things like the air vents. (I also cannot imagine how they are going to keep the white couches and chair looking clean as the tourists roll in.) All that said, the real deal breaker for me was the a\/c. When I'm in Vegas, I want my room to be dark, and I want to be able to make my room cold for my recovery cocoon, especially during the summer. The a\/c was not even close to being up to that task. I had the thing set on auto\/hi with a set temp of something ridiculous like 50 degrees just to see if it would work, and I could never get the temperature of the room to drop below 71 - and that was only after I had it running for 7 hours with no one in the room whatsoever. The lowest I could get it with me in there was closer to 73. Again, this temp is fine for daily going-about-your-business, but not when trying to sleep or when I want an arctic chill surrounding me. The fact that the system was clearly incapable of even coming close to hitting the actual target is honestly enough to keep me from staying there again.

As far as the property overall, on the Vegas spectrum, I'd put the experience as something closer to a Planet Hollywood, which is fine, but not for the prices they're currently charging, especially for the far-flung location. I had a car with me for this trip, but I would never stay here if I knew I had to rely on cabs and\/or the monorail alone. You're just too far from everything if you ever plan on leaving the property's grounds more than once a day\/night.

As others have mentioned, the casino itself had exposed ""industrial"" ceilings, which may work in some venues, but just left the whole place feeling a bit unfinished. In general, there wasn't really anything on the property that makes you say ""wow."" Again, I say this knowing full well that SLS never intended to be a 5 star direct competitor to the likes of Cosmo and Wynncore, but it still feels like it leaves something to be desired even as a 4 star. I personally don't mind the darker color scheme seen throughout the property, but some people apparently hate it, so there's that if you give a damn.

That said, Griddle Cafe made me a tasty scramble at 5am, so at least they've got that going for them.

Oh, and a pro tip: if you're valeting for the hotel, head to the back entrance on Paradise and Sahara. That valet will put you right next to the ""front"" desk. If you're more concerned with casino access, the main valet entrance on the strip will do the job.",9,3,6

So I was very happy when I heard that the Sahara wasn't going to be torn down. However, I wasn't as happy when I heard about what it was going to be converted to. Now that I've actually been inside the place, my perspective is a little bit more in the middle. 

Aside from the back hallway section, I could barely even tell it was once the Sahara just going off of layout alone. It felt strangely smaller (I could be wrong, but it seems like the entire section that was once the Nascar Cafe seemed to be a VIP affair). In addition to the fact that, while the Sahara had five public entry points, the SLS now only has two, with one of those former entry points being converted into an employees only entrance and the other two being sealed off completely. Not sure if I like that or not.

I do remember the Sahara being pretty dark, but now they've made it so dark in here you can barely even see in certain parts of the building. It was also a little bit too corporate for my taste. Example: all of the retail being owned by Fred Segal. Well, I guess we should be happy that at least the owner made the wise decision to not slap his name on everything which is what it was starting to look like he was going to do.

In spite of all this, I still kinda liked the place. Now, granted, this could just be because the place hasn't been a runaway success, but I like how it's attempting to be locals friendly. The automatic free play you receive when signing up for their players card and the fact that certain restaurants in the property give discounts to locals are all nice perks. I plan on trying both Umami Burger and The Griddle Cafe in the future. 

The nightlife actually appealed to me, a rarity with The Strip. Okay, LiFE fits into my stereotypical idea of Strip nightclubs, but Foxtail on the other hand? While I didn't go in, I stood outside to observe and listen to the music and I liked how it didn't seem to be a fist-pumping affair and it actually played a variety of music, not a bunch of David Guetta and Tiesto remixes. And I've heard lots of good things about The Sayers Club as well. 

There were also multiple reminders of what the place once was. I spotted a chandelier with fixtures of the Sahara ""S."" Some of the slots were labelled ""Sahara Slots."" Some of the walls had pictures of 50s and 60s era Vegas. I really appreciate how the owner didn't just try and make like what was there before never happened! And I also enjoyed the subtle aspect of humor and camp that was prevalent. See: The monkey stuff and the statue in the porte cochere. Oh, and did I mention I actually had some luck with gambling in this place? That makes it one of literally only three places on the strip where lady luck was on my side (the other two being Slots-A-Fun and The Stratosphere). 

SLS isn't exactly a ""home run"" for me, but I think it has some great potential going for it, so I'll just wait and see. 

The Final Verdict:

Pros: 
Well, for one, it was once the Sahara!
Strip joint that's accessible for locals. 
You get free play just for signing up. 
Appealing nightlife and dining options. 
Doesn't take itself too seriously.
Loose slots by strip standards. 

Cons:
Dark and kinda creepy feeling interior. 
Overly corporate in some aspects.
Isolated from the rest of the Strip (but thankfully that's changing soon)

Huh?:
What's with the lack of entrances? There could at least be one on the corner of Sahara @ LV Blvd.

Return factor: 8\/10. I like the place enough to give it more chances in the future.",1,1,1

Aside from this, they are good quality and not fragrance-laden.  However: For the health-conscious traveler who may want to bring your own fruit salad, yogurt, etc., Beware. The rooms do not have complimentary refrigerators as some of the Starwood Preferred Guests\/Tribute Properties do. So, DO NOT remove any items from the bar fridge to store your own stuff. The items are sensored and are automatically charged to your bill if not replaced within 60 seconds. Read the fine print on item tags beforehand to avoid being charged for each item and an additional $30 fee for utilizing the bar cooler for storing personal food items. However, for $25.00 per night, the hotel will allow guests with perishable items to rent a small refrigerator. I spoke with the manager, Matt, over the phone on the same evening of my check-in and explained the error of my ways. He was understanding and opted to remove the charges as a one-time courtesy. With high expectations due to staying in other SPG hotels that have complimentary in-room refrigeration, SLS Las Vegas has caught me off guard in this aspect. Otherwise, it's an absolute lovely place to stay. Ciel Spa is simple, with no jacuzzi, but with a steam room and a custom of having massage deals during certain times of the year. Beware the onsite cab service. Walking and\/or using UBER is probably more cost effective depending on your situation. Poolside bar menu is good and staff are helpful, vigilant, & polite.",0,0,0

Creepers everywhere cocktail waitresses not cute neither are the dealers. & awkward layout. With everyone bumping you in your chairs. Annoying because the chairs are so close together. Super cold inside maybe because the ceiling is so high. I know casinos are supposed to be cold but wear winter clothes if u go here this ones like Antarctica maybe because the ceiling vaults are so high. No room to walk. Where you get your Player's Card. That line took 30minutes alone to stand in. Usually those lines are QUICK in other casinos....And I went 8\/25 Monday AFTER grand opening. I will give the buffet credit though its a bit overpriced though M Resort buffet tops that and it's a station casino. SLS buffet 40.00 dinner buffet each.

And although there are a lot of cosmetic improvements, I still feel that Sahara vibe even after the $400 million dollar renovations by Mr. Nazarian and the SLS group from LA.

Positives:

Great beds - the Simmons mattresses are the best in Vegas bar none.  I have stayed in all the hotels up and down the strip and these are great!

Awesome TVs in every room - 55 inch Samsungs.  Made me want to go buy one!

Casino - done nicely, and the the best employees on the property - in terms of friendly.

Negatives:  Hotel is remodeled nicely but the rooms are on the smallish size.  In Vegas - everyone wants to go large, and rooms included - bathrooms are small too (but nice design)  Reminds me of NYC.

Since this is a remodel, the old elevators suck.  I think the elevators are 30 years old and are small standard OTIS ones that remind you of the 80s.

Check in area (again small) since they are working off the old Sahara property.  Nazarian is a smart guy.  He takes properties that are run down, gets them for cheap and refurbishes them for a nice launch.  Problem is that in VEGAS - you have a ton of competition (WYNN, PALAZZO, ARIA, COSMO.......) which are all first class, his hotel ends up short on 2nd Tier.  

Employees and staff just seemed depressed or not wanting to be there.  Everyone from the valet, doorman, security, check in- man -  just were almost bitter compared to the ones on the strip....  that is a problem that can be solved by owners but does not seem to be a priority.  I even saw concierge girls yawning and bored - which is a big no-no in the hotel business.  

Probably won't come back unless I get comped.",5,1,2

Giant light-up mirrors, a big TV with messaging options, colorful drinking glasses - an overall very hip design.  The soaps and toiletries in that bathroom seemed unusually nice too.  

This hotel is very LA - and is intended to give people a taste of the city of angels. You'll find LA's iconic Griddle restaurant in here, along with Katsuya sushi. If you're from LA none of this will be very interesting to you, but if you aren't from LA, and want to experience a taste of it, this is the spot in Vegas.",2,0,0

Newsflash SLS...I will never step foot on any of your properties or spend a penny within your company ever again...have fun being shut down soon.

So, I was in town for a convention...if you must know, it was KBIS.  Last time I was ""conventioning"", I stayed at The Platinum - BORING!  This time, I decided to try something new and SLS was it.

Here are the highs:

I liked the vibe of the place - it's a casino resort with restaurants, bars and shops - all wrapped up in a kinda trendy-cool, but not over-the-top crazy decor.  Fun.

Nice food selection.  I ate at Cleo - loved it (I'll do a separate review).  Umami Burger, Beer Garden & Sports Book for lunch was good.  There were a few other places that looked interesting - for the size of the place, SLS has several solid food choices.

My room was quite comfortable - no issue with size.  Again, I liked the funky decor - much more fun than several other places I've stayed in Vegas.  Loved the ultra fast elevators up\/down to the 5th floor.

Pretty close to the Convention Center - I walked back to the SLS on a sunny day (~20 minutes).

Staff was overall pretty friendly - bell hops were excellent.

Lows?  Nothing too low, but worth noting:

Early morning noise from the street (I faced the street with the monorail).  Not horrible, but not super quiet.

Far away from the Strip - not mileage-wise, but far enough that I spent $20 and 1\/2 hour in traffic via cab to meet friends at Caesars.  Don't stay at SLS if you plan to spend lots of time on The Strip - traffic sucks in Vegas.  BTW, I didn't try the monorail - it just seemed counter-intuitive to walk to public transit with a beer in my hand.

At check-in, the line was a mile long and they didn't have all the front desk stations open to accommodate the crush of conventioneers.

Smoke present - disliked, but at least it wasn't overwhelming.

Bottom line:

I enjoyed a drink at Monkey Bar, coffee at The Perq, dinner at Cleo and lunch at Umami Burger.  My wife lost $100 on slots, but had fun doing so.  My stay was 2-nights of decent sleep in a nice room - it worked out well.

4 stars",7,4,5

We checked in and they first gave us a king room in the story tower. We were not happy about it. It was way too small, I felt like we were in someone's basement and I felt claustrophobic. The decor was definitely modern, but maybe too modern for me. I wasn't feeling the metal\/yellow theme. Only thing I liked was the mirror on the ceiling, haha. 

So I called the front desk saying that I wasn't satisfied with our room at all and needed something bigger. I also mentioned that this was not the room that was shown when I booked the reservation. They apologized for the inconvenience and upgraded us for free :) We then ended up in the world tower and the room was so much better. The bathroom and room looked crisp and clean thanks to the all white decor. The infinity mirrors were my favorite. The blinds were pretty weird it was a black and white photo that had a bunch of random people on it.. Kinda creepy but I chose to ignore it. 

One downfall is that its super far from the main strip. 

Most of the workers were nice and helpful for the most part. Except the ones that worked at The Perq (coffee shop downstairs). They were super snobby. 

Oh and YES, the rooms are smaller than most but it was perfect for us two. I would definitely stay here again.",2,0,3

I was a little apprehensive about my upcoming trip here due to mixed reviews, but considering the awesome deal I got for 6 days, 5 nights I figured it'd be cool because its Vegas and it's not like I was going to be spending much time in my hotel room anyway. I was originally supposed to check in on Wednesday, but due to Dallas deciding to monsoon, my flight got canceled and I checked in the following morning around 8 a.m. or so. I called in advance to let them know of the change and even though I still lost the night, they made notation on my account to hold my room for a late check out. Check in was super fast and easy, and staff was courteous. When I arrived in my room, it was spotless and adorable. I've noticed how people complain about how small the rooms are (well, at least the world tower rooms), but Jesus people, if you actually read the room description on the website when you booked, it lays out the square footage so you know what to expect. Also, if you read the fine print, you'll see there is a 25.00 plus tax (total 28.00) resort fee (charged out check OUT and taken off of the incidentals hold). People get so infuriated about it, but I swear it lists it on the website and if you would do your due diligence, you won't be surprised at checkout. Same goes for the next 100.00 per night incidentals hold (charged at check IN)...These are typical fees for hotels people, sheesh. Moving onward....

PROs:
Its trendy....Think LA trendy. This is perfect for the 21-later 30s aged crowed who wants to have that actual ""Vegas feel"" to their experience. (I however would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone a little older (40s plus), because it definitely caters to a younger crowd that someone older might have outgrown, fyi)

THE BEDS!!! omg soooooo comfortable. The SLS king bed is probably one of the best hotel beds I've ever slept in. 

The Shower! I didn't want to get out of that steamy, high pressured amazingness

Direct monorail access!! This was a big plus for me, as I had no intentions on renting a car. People complain about the distance to the strip  (which really isn't bad at all), but for 12.00 per day, you can get a 24 hour pass. There's even 4.00 off a monorail pass in the little coupon book you get at check in. 

Quite a few food options to fit any budget. The little restaurants they have here are good too (I highly recommend 800 Degrees)

Reasonably priced. Like I said, I got a packaged deal, but I checked regular pricing and its still very affordable for all it has to offer.

Mirrored lights = perfect for Vegas hotel selfies. Ha

Super friendly staff.

2 night clubs,  a casino, 2 pools, 3 bars. Lots to do! Albeit, the casino is smaller and the Gambling Gods weren't loving me while I was there.


CONs:
The elevators do tend to take FOREVER to arrive. Even when it's not crazy packed and busy. 

No drawers to put clothes in\/limited spacing. I was not too turned off by this because I'm lazy and would rather live out of my suitcase anyway, but I can see this being an issue for neat folk. 

The wifi\/cable does kind of suck. (But at the same time, you're in Vegas! Get off your phone\/TV and party!!)


Overall, I would probably stay here again, but would definitely do a lux suite next time for added space and a little more luxury. I really enjoyed my stay!",3,0,0

Everything you look at is Art. I think I loved that the most.

It is very clean. Which is another wonderful thing about it. There is music playing all the time, but it Is nice, not pounding in your head.

Lots of restaurants here to choose from as well. I did not notice a buffet though. So not sure about that.

I had stayed at the Sahara before which used to stand in the same spot. Thinking it was a new hotel, and having been to the SLS in Beverly Hills, I had somewhat of an expectation when I arrived here.

The lobby was unimpressive, sharing space with the Monkey Bar and Perq, a grab-n-go operation serving sandwiches, coffee etc. Everything feels super chaotic when you take into consideration people waiting in line to check-in, and those lingering at the bar, plus those walking to and from the room to the casino.

The guy who checked me in was courteous and accommodated my request for a room closer to the elevator. I requested a non-smoking room, but when I got to the room, it smelled of cigarettes. I didn't have time to go back downstairs to contest this so just left it. The most surprising factor is the teenie tiny room I got in the World Tower. Our beds were full sized, not queen. The room had mirrors all over to create the feeling of spaciousness but it was super small. My friend who was sharing the room joked that it was designed by Ikea. Everything felt cheap -- not what I expected from the SLS brand.

For the online price we paid ($89 before tax and resort fees), I would say was a decent price. If I had paid more, I would have been really pissed off. There are other hotels on the strip which offer better rooms at similar prices and are located in prime real estate on the strip. SLS is on the very end of the strip so really, it shouldn't really be as expensive as other hotels. The casino is also tiny. 

We got VIP entry into Foxtail, the nightclub, but even with free drink coupons, we didn't stay because it wasn't really enticing enough. All the tables were reserved for bottle service like all nightclubs are in Vegas and standing around while we drank is not appealing to me. The free drinks are super watered down so we ended up buying our own drinks anyway.

Would I stay here again? Only if I absolutely have to and the prices were reasonable enough to make me want to. Otherwise, it really isn't worth it. It isn't a nice hotel, nor is it in a location where it is easily accessible even with the monorail -- which you now have to pay for.",13,6,8

The downside is I saw a few things in the room that looked dirty(towel and make up stain on the sheets). Check in is at 3 pm :\/. It also sucked to have to get a taxi out at night. It is not really walking distance from the main things on the strip but walking distance to a liquor store, McDonald's, and Walgreens.

Needless to say, we were very nervous once we read the reviews on Yelp. First of all, these rooms are not suites. They aren't anywhere close to being suites. They are nice rooms but they shouldn't be sold as suites. 
We showed up at 3:30 to check in and our room wasn't ready. When we booked it, the web site showed that we book a suite with a view of the pool. We ended up getting our room close to 5 PM. Our view was of the parking lot and not the pool. We were just happy to have a room so we didn't complain. As we are unpacking, a bell hop comes into our room. He didn't even bother to knock. He was told that no one was in this room and he was looking for someone's credit card that they left behind. There was no credit card in the room. After this we locked our room so no one would just walk in and help themselves to random credit cards. 
The room likes to make a lot of noise at night too. The air conditioning is super loud and the fridge in the room likes to hum. The phone also likes to reset itself at night so it lights up the entire room. The windows aren't sound proof so it was fun listening to the sirens all night long. 
The staff was friendly but that's about it. We knew that it was far from the strip so I can't complain about the distance. 
The crowd is definitely different but entertaining. 
I did win money on the slots so that made up for waiting for our late room.

From the moment we got there they started screwing up and it just didn't stop. I will list the problems but I must emphasize the BIGGEST problem. They were rarely apologetic for mishaps which was the most egregious part of the experience. I expected some kinks as it was the second weekend they were open, however, the unwillingness of the majority of the employees to fix the problems was shocking. 
Problems: 
1. We waited over 10 minutes at the valet for a bellhop. We were the only ppl waiting so it wasn't like there was a line. When we asked what was going on, the valet told us there was only ONE bellhop working that post on the Friday afternoon before Labor Day weekend. Poor planing to say the least. 
2. When checking in, we asked the front desk where a good place in the hotel would be to grab drinks. The places she said to go were closed and the places she said were closed were the ones open. We spent an hour walking around the hotel later that night due to her poor information
3. We got to our room and the toilet clogged. We called down to get it fixed 3 times before anyone came. When we asked to switch rooms they said we didn't need to because they would fix it, but it took too long for someone too come, we had to go down to the lobby to use the bathroom.  If they couldn't send someone to fix it they should have honored our request to switch. Instead, they argued with us during not only the first but also the second call down to get it fixed. 
4. We ordered a rollaway and confirmed 3 times at check in. When one didn't come, we called and they said it was a fire hazard for a rollaway to be in that room. We had to switch, which the wouldn't let us do due to the clogged toilet so to be honest we weren't too upset about that. Except, it took 4 hours and 3 calls to get the rollaway to out next room.  Each time we called they said it wasn't in the system, and they would enter it and it would come right away. We would tell them the last person did that, and they would say well it wasn't Entered and I am entering it now, so it will come. We tried to tell them obviously the system is not working right but each person insisted we were wrong and they had fixed the problem. Clearly NOT the case. 
4. The bell hop that we waited 10 min upon arrival, lost our bags. When we called down, we told them we had dinner reservation at the hotel restaurant in 10 min and we need our stuff. It was a hotel restaurant, not one person we spoke to ( we called multiple time) offered to call the restaurant and have them hold our reservation. They only questioned our need for our luggage prior to dinner. 

This all happened in the first few hours. It didn't get better. I won't bore you with the additional details but I just want to warn everyone NOT to go. There are plenty of wonderful hotels on the strip with great service. I spent over 25%  of our vacation fixing their mistakes. Our room didn't get cleaned for 3 days. We showered with dirty towels. A holiday inn would have been better.
They have these people in red checkered blazers all over the hotel. I think they tell them to be extremely rude and unhelpful because I didn't speak to one in 3 days that smiled. 

As mentioned earlier, the absolute worst part was when speaking to multiple managers the only real thing anyone did was take 100$ off our 1000$ + bill. You would expect a lot more after such a nightmare experience. 

I tend to be a very satisfied customer and I travel a ton. I have never ever ever seen anything like this.  Don't waste your time or money. It doesn't even seem like they care about how awful it is. 

For most people vacations are hard earned and few and far between. This wasn't a vacation for me. I feel like I spend a lot of money and time on frustration and I am not getting any of my time back and they only felt the need to give me back less than 10 percent of my hard earned money.",23,8,4

Logistically it worked out well. A quick 5-minute walk to the CC (which is often less that you'd spend waiting in other hotels' taxi cues) and also a reasonably close taxi ride from other Strip locations.

The hotel is as hip, cool, trendy, fashion-foward as one would expect from the SLS brand. Creative restaurants, bars, and clubs. I stayed in the World Tower and the room was comfortable, clean, and well appointed. The mini-bar is well stocked, and the bath products are very nice.

My complaint has to do with the check-in process. My reservation had been inexplicably canceled, so I had to go through some hurdles to check in. It took about an hour until I was finally in my room.

Another hassle was that I specifically added my girlfriend's name to my room when I checked in. ""No problem it's taken care of"" I was told. When my girlfriend arrived to get her key she was told her name wasn't on the room.  Now at that point I was actually already gone, and in a different country (don't ask), so she too ended up having to wait almost an hour while I was tracked down, the hotel emailed me with a number of questions, and ultimately they gave her a key. On one hand I appreciate the security measures of not giving out keys to anyone who says they're supposed to have one, but please don't tell me ""its taken care of"" if it wasn't.

So in conclusion, I'll likely stay there again, but I hope they get their front-desk issues resolved.",2,1,1

-3oz Ciel products
-slippers
-robes
-shower cap, sewing\/dental\/shave kit, mouthwash, loofah

Pluses:
-Housekeeping was on pointe throughout our stay.  Turndown service.
-Nice view from our room, seeing nature was a nice break
-Mirrors, everywhere, including the ceiling
-Comfy bed and linens
-Great décor and themes throughout the property\/room
-humidifiers are available, but staff need to be trained to relay the message to the client
-Free WIFI with resort fee
-wonderful collection of eateries
-nicely carpeted throughout to help with a gal and her love of heels
-plenty of spaces to sit, other than in front of a slot machine

Improvements needed:
-Our cable was out 48 hours AND we called 3x, walked physically down to guest service and lastly to the manager, finally it was complete
-When we walk into a resort with our bags in hand, the staff need to offer directions, he gave us eye contact and we had to ask
-Night light and dimming option in the bathroom is needed
-Taxis are not easy to come by here, plan accordingly
-poker room?

Not sure why these people are incompetent with their billing but it is very frustrating.

We are going to try to resolve this with SLS before calling a bank and maybe putting a block with this vendor. Why are they holding and charging hundreds of dollars on the card when we left the hotel days ago.

It is across the street from some run down and outdated souvenir shops and the Stratosphere known as one of the worst hotels on the strip.  We went to Umami burger while we were there and while there was no one in the restaurant we were told by the hostess that there was going to be a 15 minute wait.  Having been to other SLS hotels in Miami and LA I could appreciate the modern decor but the casino floor carpet was a bit over the top for me.

The room was the ugly yellow color tile with mirrors hiding the toilet and the shower. The bed is placed in the middle of the room. Leaving no room for anything. The bed had a plastic piece as a  head board which looked so dirty - hand prints, black spots, and some very suspicious stains near the head of the bed .. -_- I already like a clean room when I'm paying for it and at the size and the filth of the room I couldn't believe what we just walked into... Reluctantly I plopped on the bed to just pick my feet up and look up there is a mirror on the still under construction looking ceiling- which I will include pictures of... My boyfriend knew I was not happy with this and after bringing this all to his attention he wasn't happy with it at all .. We immediately called Excalibur because we stayed there last year same time (Valentines Day) and loved it! So he calls and we where about to pack up to get ready to go there instead, the manager tells my boyfriend he will upgrade us to a suite at the same rate.. I told my boyfriend ok we can check it out- I didn't feel like traveling any more than I had to , so as we gather our belongings to head to the new room I see a bell man, and ask if I could use the cart to make the transferring of rooms easier - he said no I'm not allowed to let u do that. Okayy this is strike 3 for me but I'm forgiving and we get the key to the upgraded room, yes the room is beautiful and spacious- the carpets should have been cleaned the floor was sticky . But I brushed it off.. I'm just done at this point ... The weather had been nice when we came into town and we where really looking forward to jumping in the pool.. I had my boyfriend call down stairs to see if the pool was open and they had told us no because it's not the season... They didn't even give an option to go to another pool or anything.  After this we had decided to just relax and go to the casino play a little roulette. The waitresses are pushy about tips, the area is just so over rated and probably had to up charge everything because this is NOT ON THE STRIP- also I noticed a lot of transgender and gays in this hotel, seems like they are catering to the gay, LGBT client.. I have no problem with this but some might, so if your going to this hotel and that's not your flavor just a heads up! 
Also for the room there is a 25$ charge for just opening the mini fridge make sure u don't use it not even for personal use! I get that it's vegas and they charge for everything as every place does but never once have I herd of a fee for opening the fridge ..  All in all their service at this place was horrible the people have no clue what they are doing as at as the front desk workers, they are rude and snooty. In all honesty the surrounding area is all under construction and being developed when ur not woken up by Maids knocking on the door even though you have ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door your woken up by the construction going on around you. The strip is not too far when taking an uber, but not anywhere near you so you can't even walk to the strip of you wanted to.. Last day there we where trying to rent a car and surprise surprise they didn't even have that! When being charge resort fees when there aren't resort amenities is absolutely ridiculous. If your used to a quality room don't plan your trip to this place!  I love vegas and the vibes but this place is definitely on my shit list of worst hotel I've ever stayed at. I never write review but this one I couldn't pass up in hopes of helping the next couple\/ persons\/ anyone looking to enjoy themselves to have this place ruin our trip.. I feel like there is so much more but you get the point. I forgot to mention our room key didn't work half way through our trip and had to go get it done again to get up to the room, after we got it reissued we went to the room and once again the keys didn't work.. Had to go back downstairs and get it done again then back up to the room.. This place really made my stay the wort time I've ever had in vegas .. It's the first time I can honestly say I can't wait to go home",0,0,0

Our room,  actually EVERY SINGLE ROOM in the  hotel has ZERO coffee makers.  They don't have a single maker on site.  Secondly, our room has a window screen with individuals clapping,  as like at an outdoor concert (not romantic in any way) they offer a full wet bar,  snacks and wonderful towels that are soft,  however the walk in shower floods the entire bathroom.  
There are no,  ZERO drawers to place any belongings,  including the infamous Gideon Bible.

THIS HOTEL IS NOT UNDER 21 FRIENDLY. The pool is 21+ over, and the pool for the younger group of people is just a crappy pool you'd find in a 1 star hotel. 

The rooms are really gaudy in a bad way. The beds are only enough for one person. You feel very claustrophobic in that room. 

There are alcoholic beverages inside of the rooms ready to be consumed. Again, not a kid friendly place.

After filing the report, I was informed by Risk and Safety Manager Jason Hudson that there was a safe in my room. 

I then asked Mr. Jason Hudson if all personal property that can't physically fit into the safe are subject to theft. 

His response didn't acknowledge my question. 

Having two rooms for four nights the week of a convention ran about $2,500 total. Not including the cost of my stolen personal property.

The check in process was as normal as any other hotels. The elevators were fast despite others reviews. Only time they were slow was on a Saturday when everyone is using them. But there are 8 elevators. 

The rooms are very modern looking and great for a place to stay. If you want a larger room or a penthouse, book one. These rooms are normal sized. 

Their theme is classy but ready too ""monkey"" around. Hence the monkeys all over the place. I thought that's a bit intelligent though. Reminds me of the Cosmo a bit, but on a budget.

Only drawback is they are on the north end of the strip. Until all the resorts are finished in that area, they lack notoriety. Take the shuttle at $12 per day. It's about a 15 min ride to the MGM, so we did that daily and were fine. Parking is easy, the people were easy too talk too, and the staff was good.

I found the SLS to be perfect.  I started the weekend at Caesar's and appreciated SLS was not in the middle of the madness but still convenient to get to by the monorail (which in itself is a fun ride).

Since I didn't gamble, I can't really speak for the casino but it seemed a good size, not too big or small.  I did shop and the Fred Segal stores were a dream come true.  Great selection, helpful sales people, and I liked how the different departments were separated throughout the casino. Plus they included a naughty shop.

I was excited to try the Umami Burger since I haven't been able to get down to the one in NYC.  Food-wise it lived up to my high expectations and it was helpful to have it combined with the sports betting area so we could watch the games.  At night we went to LiFE and Sayers Club.  Both were lots of fun and actually renewed my interest in live music.

My room in the World Tower was excellent.  Like the whole complex, I found it to be very trendy and cool but also welcoming.  Little design surprises would show up when you didn't expect them.

I wasn't too thrilled when the hotel was revealed to say the least. First, this is not a 4 star hotel by any stretch. Second, it is barely on the strip. I learned my lesson and will never use Priceline again.

I called the SLS right away to ensure that I could get 2 queen beds instead of a king. They assured me it was no problem. When I arrived, they told me that it would be a $15 per night ""upgrade"". Because I had already paid through Priceline, there was nothing I could do besides be pissed. This is on top of the $28 resort fee per night. Imagine my mood once I actually got inside the room to check out my 4 star upgraded room.

They do not have queen beds. They are full size beds, like when you were 12. There is no fridge, no microwave, and no coffeemaker. The room is painfully small for 2 people. I have honestly never seen a hotel room this small. The only saving graces for the room are the decent size tv and the shower. It was roomy with plenty of hot water. 

The only place I ate inside the casino was the Unami burger place. I paid $22 for a burger and iced tea. I got the original and was very disappointed. The mushroom was tough and it had stewed tomatoes on top. It was not good. The patty was way too small for the huge bun. 

The casino inside is tiny and pretty dead in general. It's almost just there as a display. There is a club and a pool and those are probably the people that SLS is targeting and the only guests that would be happy here.",1,0,0

We booked a ""World Class"" suite. Based on pictures on their site we thought our $500 (plus $39\/night resort fee, so more like $560) for 2 nights would at least get us a posh stay.
WRONG!!!!!
We walked into a room the size of a college dorm! Literally, probably smaller. The two 'full' beds looked like twin beds, the carpet was literally utilitarian (like in an office building), everything was stark and dark. . So to offset that, they had huge mirrors on EVERY wall, some lighted. It actually made us MORE claustrophobic. Ceilings were VERY low, to add to the stifling feeling. NO surfaces to place anything at ALL, nor room to unpack or put things. Hugely un-functional (the only 'huge' thing about it, lol).

When I called management, they offered to upgrade us for $80\/night MORE. Other than that it was sorry- charlie. Greg at front desk was argumentative and unhelpful. THANKFULLY he reminded me I'd booked through Travelocity, so I called them and they fully refunded so that we could GET OUT OF THERE and go stay at Alexis Suites. Alexis has a kitchen, front room and bedroom, separated by a door! So spacious!

Oh, and BTW, it's NOT A NEW HOTEL as I'd heard. It's not even really renovated as far as I can tell. It's just the Sahara redecorated (and the room smelled old\/musty). When I complained about the size of the room, the bellhop said ""Well there's not much you can do with a 70 year old building.""

We found this hotel on one of those find a cheap spot places, so we weren't expecting much. We really hadn't planned on staying in the room or hotel much at all since we wanted to have fun on the strip, but I got sick and we had to head back early. 

We were sleeping around midnight when some dude said ""Room Service"" while opening our door. Confused and disoriented, my boyfriend said no thanks and he promptly left. He did linger though.. looking at me stare at him in confusion while lying in bed. 

We called the front desk immediately, but weren't offered any kind of consolation, so we opted to deal with it in the morning. 

Next morning, we went to concierge to let them know what had happened and wanting to speak with a manager. When we told them, there wasn't any kind of reaction or apology again. The girl we spoke with encouraged us to check out and the manager would call us. We refused to check out, but allowed them the time to get back to us. 

After walking the strip and not hearing back for about 3 hours, we headed back to the hotel. Upon speaking with a new set of concierge personnel we had the same response as before: not apologetic at all, and wanted us to wait for a call from the manager. We opted to wait in front of the desk until we spoke with a manager. 

When the manager came out, she was extremely apologetic and consoling. She took our room number and asked for a couple minutes to look up the account and investigate. When she came back, she had greatly reduced the cost of the room and offered us her sympathy. She had checked us out and handed us our checkout slip\/receipt and said she would still investigate. 

We left feeling violated and wronged on a degree we never have had in leaving a hotel. I was the one that was sick and I encouraged by boyfriend to stay out. What if he had? What if I was in that room alone and sleeping? 

The way the first three people reacted and treated us was just wrong. It seemed obvious to us that this is what happens at this hotel, and all the employees know it. 

After all of that, we will most likely need to dispute invalid charges on our credit card that we put down for incidentals. The amount held has doubled since we checked out, and almost a week later we still have no resolution. 

After reading this, if you do decide to stay here, don't leave anything valuable in your room, definitely opt to secure the safety latch if you decide to stay in, and be sure to keep track of your charges.

I got a reservation on Hotel Tonight. I normally stay at the Wynn but it was overpriced for the weekend. I had heard some nice things about the SLS and I thought, hey, why not? 

The hotel itself is fine. You can definitely see that it's built on top of the Sahara. The rooms are small and the entire hotel is tiny. A friend remarked that the casino was so tucked away that the SLS didn't want you to gamble. But for the price? It's not bad, room size is on par with something at the Mirage or TI.

The service is where the SLS falls down. Checking in at 11pm there was a ridiculous line. The desk staff seemed oblivious and annoyed that we wanted to you know, check in. This is a running theme throughout the SLS. The entire staff acts like you are bothering them when you ask them to do their job. They just roll their eyes and pout. I see this a lot in Los Angeles where everyone thinks they are too good for the service industry, and they are waiting for a call from an agent about their big break. But in Vegas? Totally unacceptable.

That night we ordered room service. The food is good (it comes from the Northside Cafe) but every time we called I had to wait on hold for twenty minutes, and it came delivered in a takeout doggie bag. Keep in mind, I was paying about the same I would for room service at the Wynn but with zero service.

Saturday morning I called the spa to get a salon appointment for my fiancée. They could get her in for a mani, or a hair cut, but a mani, pedi and haircut was completely impossible. They didn't have the staff. I called the Wynn, they picked up the phone instantly, and had her an appointment in 10 minutes. Keep in mind, this was supposedly ""impossible at the SLS"".

When it came time to check out there was an hour Long wait to check out, so I just did the express check out. The bell man whined when I didn't immediately tip him. And the valets took about twenty minutes to get my car.

The SLS is a cute idea. Old Vegas chic, but the service is so bad it ruins the concept. The crowd that the SLS attracts also brings down the entire concept. It's a pretty ghetto, cracked out crowd. If you've ever been to Stratosphere or Circus Circus you know what I mean.

My recommendation? Don't stay here until they clean up the service.",5,3,0

Altogether, it was a good experience, but it is difficult for me to award the property 4 stars - it was a solid 3\/3.5 star experience, though.

There are many pros and cons to this property, the biggest and most obvious negative being it's location.  It is way at the end of the strip and there is nothing particularly interesting around it.  If you are there on vacation, you'll need to take a taxi or the monorail to get closer to the heart of the strip.  While there have been many promises to develop this end of the strip, it's obvious that they are a long, long ways away from this happening.  For me, I had one day of business meetings off-site and am a SPG Platinum member, so it was an acceptable choice.  Since I didn't want to eat at the hotel for every single meal, I did have to go offsite a few times, which was a bit of a pain.

There were many good things about this property, however.   First, I arrived at 10:30AM and my Platinum status was immediate recognized.  I was offered an early check-in and an upgrade for no cost, which was different from the person next to me, who was offered early check-in for $25.  I was also given a Platinum welcome packet, which included some actually useful coupons for the restaurants, coupons for free cocktails and\/or coffee and vouchers for free breakfast.  My upgrade was to what they called a suite in the Lux Tower and it was really just an oddly large single room with a long, large bathroom. The room was in typical modern SLS style and comfortable.  High-speed Internet was fast, reliable and free.

There were a few downsides about the room, however.  First, the towels are terrible:  the opposite of luxurious.  Second, there was no shampoo in my shower:  only conditioner and body wash (I had to request shampoo).  Third, on my last night there, my room was never serviced.  When I called, they said, ""well you must have had your Do Not Disturb sign on"", which I did not.  They did expedite housekeeping to my room, but this meant that I had to leave my room at 6:30pm after a very long day, which was a pain in a**.  This is certainly not 4 or 5 star service.  Also, it would be nice to have a full-length mirror in the room.

I do like the small selection of restaurants at the SLS.  I've eaten at Bazaar Meats before and did have a full meal here one night and a small snack at the bar another night.  It is always and experience here, albeit a pricy one.   My free breakfast one morning at Northstar Cafe was really excellent.  I also had a great ""boozy afogato"" at the coffee shop using my free drink coupon.  Their addition of Cleo seems like a good choice, although I haven't eaten there - their Miami location is great, however.

All in all, this is a decent property.  It may not be your cup of tea, but if the rates are reasonable, it may be worth checking out.",0,0,0

For opening week there were no glitches, snafus or problems - at any level.  The staff was AMAZING!!!!  Outgoing, friendly, helpful, cheery.  And this included the people vacuuming carpets, slot machine attendants and every last employee I came in contact.  

The casino is small, but that's fine.  Great machines and plenty of tables.  And I even found the $5 Roulette Table and the $10 Blackjack Table.  And there were multiples at this level.

My room was comfortable, spacious, and I was able to work easily from it.  The decor was very bohemian and I liked it.

The range of restaurants is much fewer than other Strip hotels, but the quality of food and service at the ones I tried here were OUTSTANDING!!!!  Also, the price point for the restaurants is unheard of on the Strip.  You will not break the bank eating in this hotel.

My one suggestion for them to to do some sort of signage for Check-in versus Casino.  They have two valets, one for Casino (most obvious, right off of the Strip, and another around the corner for the hotel - not easily found since there's no signage at street level nor any information in my reservation to direct me on how to get to this ""other"" valet.

If you want something that's not a ""theme"" casino - stay here.  If you want good service - stay here.  If you want a more funky Vegas atmosphere - stay here.  And no, the hipster quotient isn't off the charts (yet).",3,1,1

The entire hotel feels like someone went over the top to attempt to be ""hip"" when designing it. Nothing feels right, and it's the most akward vibe there is. I stayed in 2 rooms, as they moved me for being overbooked. Yup, had to pack up and move rooms mid-stay. Who does that?? They even had security come to my room to make sure I was moving because I insisted on not moving rooms...why would I?? And the security guard was the biggest piece of sh*t you could ever imagine.

 My second room had a sideways creepy ass mirror on the ceiling and the entire walls were covered in drapes...terrible, terrible drapes...that were covered in dust and made my allergies insane. It smelled CRAZY in there! Seriously considered sleeping in the car. Why would you think covering all of the walls in fabric is a good idea. This room also had 2 full beds, and a window into the shower. What's the point??


To top if it off...I GOT BED BUGS HERE!!! Yup. Pretty sure they came from the room COVERED IN DRAPES. You know, where bed bugs have a million places to hide. This was great to bring home to my house with a baby in it...real nice.

Oh, yeah, pricing fluctuated from $120 to $370 a night during my stay, depending on day of the week.

Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT stay here. There are so many other great places you can stay in Vegas. This one will be out of business in a few years so don't waste your money.",0,1,0

Adding in a bunch of different Fred Segal boutiques every 500 yards doesn't help, but as others have mentioned, there seem to be a whole lot of staff doing a whole lot of nothing.

The gambling floor is clean, the floorplan is simple (and hasn't changed from the Sahara days), and I appreciate that they have a gallery but find it telling that their buffet has closed, their restaurants have cut their hours, and I can always find parking in the first row I turn into. This place is not a hotspot even when visiting on weekends, for better or worse.

Oddly though, I find myself returning- not for Umami or Griddle Café, but I actually like the low-key atmosphere. The coffee bar isn't bad either, and their higher-end restaurants seem to be executing on the appropriate level.

The hotel in BH is eclectic and hip, yet elegant and luxurious. The SLS in Vegas is all a facade. I thought they had tore down the Sahara to build the SLS, but it turns out they just renovated the original building. No matter how much you remodel something built in the 40s, you can't make it that much better if the foundation and bones are still the same crap.

Our room was a sufficient size, but small when compared to other new hotels on the strip. I'm not sure what kind of room we were in (birthday boy booked the rooms) because I don't even see it on their website, but we were on the 2nd floor of the Story Tower and I would not recommend staying in these rooms. There was a small window high above, so we couldn't even look out of it. There were broken lights (not a lot of lights to begin with) and no hairdryer. To save space, there was a sliding door on the bathroom, which revealed the bathroom sink when you closed the door to the bathroom, making it very inconvenient. Beds and pillows were not that comfortable. But because the hotel is at the north end of the strip, it was pretty quiet. Housekeeping was fast and they offer really nice slippers.

The casino is of decent size with a large bar in the middle. The restaurants on-site are good, considering they're all SBE restaurants. The nightlife also seemed to be decent, which is another one of SBE's strong suits.

I feel like whoever was in charge of renovating did the bare minimum of making this place look nice. Even though the hotel and rooms are hip and stylish, it's not luxurious at all. You can easily tell that everything used (materials, furniture [a lot of it is plastic], decor, etc.) in the hotel is second rate. Wynn, Trump, Bellagio, and Ceasar's Palace are all examples of luxurious and elegant hotels on the strip that offer fantastic ambiances. Unfortunately SLS is not one of them and I would not choose to stay here again.",15,2,1

If you thought the Sahara was a dump, well the property still is, even though it's sporting the SLS brand.  After one night we moved down to Bally's for the duration of our stay in Vegas.

The suite we booked was pretty large (as it should be) and quite spacious.  Sure, it had the chic looks and feel of posh hotel.  I will give that to SLS.  Everything looks nice and new at first glance.  Then you try to take a shower, and the water pressure is non extant.  The dirty linens under the covers were a shock to me - the first time I've ever actually come across this in any hotel & needed to have the sheets changed before I slept in them.  The damage control team was backed up and took nearly an hour to deliver clean sheets.  I know the request is unusual at 4 am, but at that time in the morning all you want is a clean and comfy bed to crash in.

The entire property stinks of ionizer, you know the stuff they spray in smoking rooms to ""freshen"" them up.  Quite frankly, I don't mind inhaling the god-aweful fumes and stench of cigarettes at the blackjack tables where it's expected, but in the rooms themselves and common area's, I'd like to not need to feel like I need hold my breath.

One night here was enough, never again.  Those flea-bag-pay by the hour-sorry existence motels have more style, luxury and service than this old rotting property.  You can dress up a pig all you want, but at the end of the day, it's still a dirty, dirty pig.",13,7,3

Felt like I was in a prison cell. The living area was barely bigger than the King size bed in the room, just enough space to walk around the bed. When I first checked in to the room it appeared there was no bathroom. Turns out they were hidden between 2 separate sliding mirrored doors. In the middle was the bathroom sink which at first I thought was just a wet bar, but turned out that was the sink for the bathroom. There is no closet, just a clothing rack and one drawer to put belongings. 

One of the reasons I booked the room because it included the mini bar in the room rate. I have stayed at many hotels in Vegas including this one before so I expected the mini bar to be similar to a standard minibar in Vegas or at least my experience the last time I stayed here. Far from it, the mini bar was a cheap rendition of a typical Las Vegas Mini bar, (see pics below). To top it all off the mini bar was not stocked upon check-in and I had to wait the next day before it was stocked and then later found out the mini bar is only stocked once per stay, not every day so if you stay 3 days you pay the extra room rate for the 3 days, in my case it was $30 extra dollars a night.

A few factors came to play here: 
*Location: While you can take the tram, the SLS is really at the butt end of the strip. The tram is easy but not great to take in 40 degree desert Winter weather. 

*Overall look & feel: Since I was born, raised and currently live in LA, the SLS doesn't really have much appeal to me. I can go to all the restaurants in LA. However, true to their vision, I think they did LA justice BUT lacks that Vegas shine I look for when I'm in Sin City. But, could be different for those who haven't been to LA! 

*Rooms: I knew to expect a small room so this was okay. The ceiling to floor mirrors are MAGIC! Love them. However, if you're going to have all-white furnishings, find a way to make sure you know how to clean it properly. Dirty white is not a good look. 

*People: I'm not sure if it's a product of being relatively affordable ($199 for two nights via a discount on Vegas.com!) the hotel visitors\/crowd seems to be a little different than the typical young Vegas party go-ers. I can't quite pinpoint it but we definitely had a scare when we woke up Sunday morning with the sound of yelling and things being thrown in the room next door. Granted this could happen at any hotel, this is the first time it has ever happened to be in Vegas. There's rowdy and there's scary-I'm-going-to-die-today rowdy.

Stayed here with my wife for the weekend of our wedding and work party, and everyone was extremely nice and very helpful every step of the way. 

Front desk staff was very busy on a Saturday afternoon check-in but everyone seemed to be working with a smile on their face and at a rapid pace. I have read other reviews slamming the desk for having to take a deposit on the room which is absolutely unfair to the employees as it's the HOTEL policy not the EMPLOYEE'S policy! Give them a break!!

Foxtail Lounge was the site of the holiday party and everyone had a great time, in part because the cooks at each of the carving stations were very nice, bilingual, and presentable. Bartenders and barbacks were busy but efficient... 

The casino floor was a little slower than you would like to see on a weekend night, but going into the holiday season much of our casinos aren't pulling in what they would like to, so it's not too concerning. I love to hang in the sports book, and although the SLS does have a William Hill 'Book', it's located awkwardly inside the Umami Burger and Beer Garden, so it's not really a place to hang and watch the game, more to just put in your bet and leave. Perhaps take one of the several retail outlets, which were not busy by any stretch, and put in a more legitimate sports book with some audio and video so you can watch your bet play out live, without feeling cramped. Just a suggestion SLS!

The room itself was fairly small, we booked the 'King Deluxe' room, not really sure what that means as they have seemingly 100 different rooms types, none of which are all that distinguishable. Room had a flat screen TV mounted on the wall, allowing the operator to watch TV, order room service, check out of the room, review dinner menus before dining downstairs, among many other options as well. For everyone that complains about the prices in the dining venues, shame on you!!! Nobody should be taken aback about menu pricing with the ease of the SLS in-room menu viewing. 

Valet was the only aspect of our visit that seemed a bit sub-standard. Although it was Sunday morning checkout, there seemed to be a few attendants walking to retrieve the cars as opposed to showing some hustle to get the guests out in a timely manner. 

We left a few personal items in the room and immediately called about them when we got home, and the lost and found operator quickly sent a security guard to the room and got our items right then. She called me back when they bagged the items and met me downstairs the next day to return them. 


Overall, our stay at the SLS was a very positive one, and I fell like a lot of the reviews here aren't giving the property a fair shot. Keep in mind it's still fairly new and streamlining such a large project isn't as easy as it may seem.

There are plenty of plugs for all of your technology and lots of natural light from large windows.  

The hotel is at the end of the Strip, and it is very accessible to the Monorail, which was a nice quick ride to the rest of the strip.  It is a little pricey ($5 per ride) but if you get the multiple-day passes (we got the 3-day pass for $28), you can make good use of it if you plan to venture out to the other casinos.  We also learned later that there are free shuttles to\/from the Miracle Mile shops and the airport (check with the hotel for frequency).  There is Walgreens and McDonald's nearby to pick up quick, cheap food or stock up on snacks and water.  Otherwise, it is a bit quiet on this end of the Strip.  It is close to the old Downtown, which is a fun, good option.

We were there from Tuesday-Friday so this cut down our dining options at the hotel\/casino a bit.  There is a very solid eating place, the Northside Café that is open 24 hours\/7 days a week.  We went there mainly for breakfast - everything we had from the corned beef hash, ham and eggs, pancakes, Belgian waffle and coffee were all really tasty and filling, and I would think lunch and dinner would also be pretty solid as well.  We ate at Umami for juicy burgers and ice cream sandwiches and Cleo for highly recommended and reasonably-priced, Mediterranean food.  Perq is also a good option for a quick breakfast or afternoon\/evening snack.  

Hotel\/casino staff were helpful from the front desk to the concierge to the bellmen to the points card desk.  One concierge young lady did not seem too enthusiastic about her job, but the rest were all very willing to help.  One girl at the cashier said I had too many cashier receipts (albeit, I did have quite a few at small amounts but she did not look that busy), and told me to go to the ATM to cash them out myself (if she provided good customer service, she would have done it anyway).  Other than that, customer service overall was very pleasant and helpful.  

I'm not a big gambler but my boyfriend plays. It's not as lively as the other casinos, but I appreciated that it was a little more laid back and the cigarette smoking or smell was less.  

The pool is ok - after seeing the pools at other casinos, it is hard to compare.  I did not go in the pool myself, but it looked decent to me.  Restrooms are clean.  Thank you, SLS, for decent, comfortable stay.  I would come back!",3,0,2

Check out the pics. This is a new, modern, young and hip hotel. Definitely good for a romantic getaway or just friends sharing a room if you want the best bang for the buck! Old rich couples who used to stay at the Bellagio can switch it up too I guess.

Given that the hotel just opened in August, formerly the Sahara, the rooms are new and clean. The carpet is so nice that you'll feel okay to walk around barefoot! 

Bathroom is so white and clean. No traces of hair or dust or pool of water. Good housekeeping work! 

Service was great! They greeted us warmly at the front desk and she was very patient to answer my questions about the monorail. Yes the monorail takes you to a couple of hotels all the way to MGM I believe, or at least it's one of the stops. I called them later to ask for a free late check-out too and they let us stay till noon, which is nice to have that extra hour!

Oh and they do have a cute, stylish design on their laundry bag. I took it home with me :P

One thing to watch out for... don't pick up the snacks or the ""intimacy package"" or whatever they have there unless you actually want them. They have a sensor and would charge you if it's away from the tray for 60 seconds. That cliche of ""put it back where you find it"" does apply, otherwise you'll be penalized... unless you actually want a small bag of Jose Andres gourmet chips that who knows how long it's been there for for 8 bucks, then go for it!

Downside - at the end of the strip, not a good location, but the monorail would make this situation better. If you drive, then I guess it's not a problem!

Would definitely check this place for availability again next time I'm in Vegas!",11,3,6

The Hotel is absolutely beautiful inside and outside. We will definitely be vacationing there again. There was only one thing that bothered me and that was when we reserved our room the extra fee of $84.00 was mentioned that we would have to pay when we checked out. What was not mentioned was that there was an 150.00 a night incidental deposit. So, even though we paid for everything weeks in advance and we thought, that was all except the $84.00

The rooms are top notch with comfortable beds, perfect lighting, and one of the things that I appreciated the most here was the fact that it didn't take 15 minutes to get to your room from the lobby.  The hotel is a true gem and I am glad Starwood and Tribute have taken note to manage this property.  I didn't use the pool, but the gym had all of the amenities for someone like me who needs to work out.  Not only did they have a vast array of machines, but free weights were essential for those requiring a heavier workout.  The parking was close.  I didn't use valet, but there was no need since the parking structure is very close.  Here is why this is my new favorite hotel in Las Vegas.... the hotel is perfect for a couple, a stag party, a work meeting, or even a single guy just wanting to get away.  There are tons of excellent restaurants inside the SLS.  There is a fun casino.  Most of all - there is a free shuttle from the airport. Last, the monorail station is also right outside.

Vegas local, staycation here through groupon.
3 nights.

Fast and efficient check in with a smile and no attitude.
Rooms- Mehh. Small, cramped, literally the only face lift this place got was ikea style furniture and a fresh coat of paint.
The resort fees are absurd, and so is the $100 night incidental fee that they hold (refund when you check out). Come on, even The Cosmopolitan doesn't have outrageous fees like that, and this is no Cosmopolitan. I've had a better stay at the Hard Rock and their basic rooms are huge, more comfortable bed, and no outrageous fees.

Check out through TV was quick and painless and received the incidental fee back within two days :).

My stay here was very pleasant. The décor of my room was vey unique but stylish. My room was also very clean. The employees here are very welcoming, they anticipate your needs before you even have to open your  mouth. Also, you have everything located inside of the hotel, from a Chinese, a breakfast and lunch, and an Italian restaurant and a coffee and pastry shop (very similar to Starbucks). They also have a sports bar located inside of the casino area. 


There are only  a few things I didn't  like.

 First, we all know mini bar fees are outrageous but I've never heard of a hotel charging a  $30 restocking fees for putting your personal items in the fridge\/mini bar. The mini bar is the closet thing to a fridge in that room and if its that much of a hassle to stock a fridge with 3 to 4inch bottles than make sure your guest have a their own mini  fridge to store their food, drinks or leftovers.

Second, the breakfast restaurant in the hotel is very small and is beyond crowed every morning. The line stretched all the way across the wall. They should expand it. I'm sure their are people who don't stay at the hotel who come to have breakfast there. But  there should be some sort of priority seating for the guest that stay at the hotel. I didn't get to eat at this restaurant or enjoy this amenity of SLS Hotel and Casino that I paid  so much for.  

Tip: This hotel and casino is about a 10min bus ride from the main area of the strip. The bus stops right in front of the main entrance of the resort. This is not a dislike for me because I didn't mind the distance and some people may prefer to stay away from the strip so they can sleep at night.  Its not far at all. On your way to the strip you get off when you see hotels like MGM, and on your way back just get off when you the funny statute thingy and the Black and White of the SLS entrance. Its very simple.",1,0,0

But if the service I received during this rough period were any indication, I can only foresee SLS being even more amazing.

For this visit, we stayed at the World Tower (I believe there are three). My room was... fun (for lack of a better word) and stylish yet lovely; modern and chic yet cozy. The bed was incredibly comfortable that I had a hard time parting from it when I woke up in the morning (this is why I am not a big fan of fancy hotels when I am on vacation: I want to be exploring, not sleeping!). What I really loved were the mirrors, though. We spent so much time goofing off in front of them (i.e. selfie awesome! Please forgive the girl her silliness...). The bathroom was well-stocked and the toiletry provided were from Ciel, the SLS spa. I also loved the slippers and the chocolates provided.

The variety of restaurants in the property is diverse - The Griddle (for breakfast aficionados), Katsuya and Ku Noodles (for Asian food lovers), The Bazaar (for meat lovers), Umami Burger (for burger lovers) and 800 Degrees Pizza (for pizza lovers). They also have Fred Segal stores. 

For the service, it was not as smooth as I thought it would be, but everybody is apologetic and tried their best to give great service. As I said, they are still learning the ropes so I gladly overlook this aspect for now. But only because everybody was super nice.

I would go back next time I am in town to see how they have improved.",14,4,6

The location can be away from the core of strip, but it serves as a good middle point between the downtown area and the strip.  The monorail station at the hotel also makes a great transportation alternative around the strip, and hopefully to the airport someday.

They have three different towers, all of them have new rooms, and I have stayed both sides before.  The Lux Tower has the best rooms, and the beds did seem bigger in comparisons with the other towers.  With status good casino or Hilton HHonors, you could generally get an upgrade there.  They do not feature any rooms with two queen size beds, but rather full size, so it could be a bit tight for a party of 4 to stay in one of those.  The room rates are usually lower than the rest of the strip because of the location unless there is a big convention at the Las Vegas Convention, then the rate would skyrocket a few folds.  

I did not spent much time at the casino or the restaurants, they seems very trendy as well, and the restaurant selections within the hotel premise are reasonably good, and they seem to try pleasing the younger generation foodie crowd.

Of all the Hilton brand hotels on the strip, the SLS was definitely my top choice whenever I stay in Vegas.  The staffs were professional, and after a certain hour, they have security guards at the elevator entrance ensuring only hotel guests can get in.  The layout for both valets and self-parking were both conveniences enough.",3,1,0

What does SLS really stand for? All I know is that SLS is a Fabulous newer hotel on the strip (used to be the old Sahara). As soon as you enter the casino and building the first thing that I noticed was the smell! It definitely smelled good, no smoke, the ventilation was awesome!

Staff: VERY friendly! One lady that helped me, I swear we couldn't stop talking, told her I was from Hawaii and that was it! Lol she wished me all the luck on gambling and also set me up with my CODE card. The staff at the blackjack tables were also very friendly, always rooted for the player which was nice for a change lol. Some casinos don't. They were also friendly since we were asking questions about their job and what not. Someday I would love to work in a casino lol. Check in and Concierge was nice! My cousins friend works there and he and his manager were very generous to them it was great! 

Casino: FAN-TAS-TIC! 
Wheel of fortune you give me fortune! Lol my cousins love that machine and so do I! We won multiple times! My second favorite was the Megabucks with 3 games. Man Vegas you know how to take my money lol. Monopoly was also another of my favorites. Machines stop taking our money! Now blackjack! Buy ins were min $10.00 sometimes in our favor but 2 out of 5 nights that we were in Vegas these blackjack tables were totally not for us LOL! Oh well win some lose some. 
Cocktail service was great, remember to tip your gal a couple of bucks and she will constantly check on you and re fill your drink. 

Rooms: OH MY GAWD. As soon as I got into my cousins room my jaw dropped lol. Gorgeous! Elevators do need a room key to get to the floor just FYI. Anyway more about the room. Literally two huge sectional couches in the rooms, two 50 inch tvs! DANG GURL! Dining room table in one room, and the king bed in the other obvi. The toiletries were like super sized lol. All in all beautiful view, and still the hotel smelled amazing no smoke smell on the floors above! 

Valet: Two places to valet, one in the front and one in the back. I find that the valet in front is not at all crowded. Most of the time the back does get crowded. Anywho nice valet people as well! Good service! And fast!

We have stayed at many of the ""main strip"" hotels, and have never had the level of service and attentiveness that we received at SLS.

We arrived very late at night on a Thursday after driving in from Arizona, we were exhausted to say the least. Check-in was an absolute breeze, and the women at the front desk were extremely helpful, and quite honestly made us feel like valued guests, as opposed to one in a million like the other casinos on the strip. 

Now on to the room. What else can I say but they are abssolutely amazing, and one of a kind. We have never stayed in a room as updated as the room (Lux Tower Suite) at the SLS. Now, we also haven't stayed at Cosmo, or Aria, because, quite frankly, those prices are ridiculous. The bed was beyond comfortable, the table space plentiful, the shower was HUGE! Biggest we have ever had in a hotel and the decor was simply amazing. The only downfall I could possibly say is there is quite a lack of clothing storage, but hey, you're on vacation, living out of the suitcase for a day or two wasn't going to ruin it for me, however, more storage would be a major plus.

We enjoyed the fact that this hotel was a little less crowded, after spending the day\/night down on the main strip, it was wonderful to come back to this casino, play some slots (we did pretty well by the way, and signed up for their rewards program CODE), and not feel like I am going to be stampeded at any moment. The feel of the hotel leans more towards sophistication, as opposed to ""quantity over quality"" like the other hotels, and I like that!

Our first night there we ate at the cafe, and I am NOT joking when I say this was the BEST meal we had in Vegas the whole 3 days we were there, I wish we had gone back! Very VERY reasonably priced (by Vegas standards), excellent service, and the food.was.amazing! We ate at Guy Fieri's at Harrahs, and I did not like a thing I tried, this Cafe? I loved EVERYTHING! And I also spent about $100 less! ;)~

All in all, we enjoyed our stay, will ABSOLUTELY be back and recommend this hotel to all of our friends and family!

I checked in around 4-5pm. There was a line but I got through it quick. There's a $200 deposit and a resort fee of $29 plus tax each night you stay. Got a room at the story tower with 2 double beds. The room is not that spacious. However, it is pretty modern. I love how the beds and the couch light up. People in the past reviews complained about the beds being too small, but I thought it was a good size. I also like how there's a mirror on the ceiling. The bathroom is pretty big, but the sink is outside next to it? I guess. There was a dirty rag that was left on the floor, but we just threw it in the trash. It wasn't a problem. The bathroom door is kind of trippy cause it's a sliding mirror that can't lock. There's also a mini fridge with alcohol in it but it has weight sensors so be careful not to move anything or else you'll get charged. 

I didn't go to any of the restaurants, but me and my friends went to Northside cafe that's open 24\/7. Thank God. We were hella tired and hungry after the club. It's a bit pricey, but hey it's Vegas.

This past Christmas we decided to stay in town rather than taking that long ride to San Diego. We treated ourselves to massages at their spa instead it was wonderful!! The massage is so relaxing because you can choose specific aromatherapy oils that they use on you. When the massage is over you can relax in a private room sipping on flavored teas and munching on cookies.
 This hotel has comfy accommodations.  In the room they have their mini bar labeled as saints and sinners. The saint side you will find things like candy and nuts. The sinner side is full of stuff that can help you make bad decisions lol. If working out is more your thing you can use their 24 hour gym. They have water and towels for you so there is no need to bring your own. 

It's also a treat to know that there are good restaurants to eat at so we don't have to leave. Cleo, the cafe and Unami burger are some of our favorite places to eat during our stay.",13,8,10

What turned out to be a pleasant first time visit quickly turned sour. While playing on the slots we were told that we cannot have our baby's stroller nearby, so quickly my boyfriend complied. Meanwhile, the security officer (men dressed in red plaid suits) instructed his partner to ""keep an eye them"", as if we had done something wrong. First of all, we are of LEGAL age and if he was skeptical of our age why didn't he ask for an id. We left right after that happened. To make matters worse, his partner once again told us we could not go in the direction of the casino to get to our car. When we told him we parked at the other end he ACCUSED us and said he saw us come in when in fact we didn't. He then followed us through the casino to the lobby area. I am so disappointed and frankly, discriminated. 

The security officers made it look like we had committed a crime when we were just there to have a good lunch as a family.

It was on its decline at that point, and during subsequent visits became a hotel-casino that I was certain to avoid.  Even considering that, I was sad to see it close (another piece of old Vegas lost) and had a lot of trepidation about the re-opening as the SLS (or the sodium laurel sulfate, as I think of it).  Can you open a swanky place on the North end of the Strip?  I decided to check it out, thanks to cheap room rates ($43 plus the ubiquitous $25 resort fee) and quick access to the highway (so we could get out to the wilderness without having to brave Strip traffic).  

I don't think you can tell this used to be the Sahara unless you really knew the old property and pay a lot of attention to the layout.  The SLS is modern and feels like a new place even though parts of the place date back to the 1950s.  It amused me to read reviews where people talked about the SLS as a property that was ""just built"" - but really, it's promising that the place feels so new and not just like a refresh of the tired old Sahara.  Maybe this will help bring new life to the North end of the Strip.  It's on the Monorail, so it's connected to the rest of the Strip without being in the middle of everything.  The restaurants all sound amazing, though we only tried the Griddle Cafe, but it was quite good (but beware - portions are INSANELY large).  

The room we got in the Story Tower was pretty crazy, and I strongly recommend checking YouTube for a video tour of one of these rooms.  Mirror on the exposed concrete ceiling, bed and sofa frames that light up, sliding mirrored panels to reveal the bathroom, and bright yellow walls.  I really liked the aesthetic and functionality of the reasonably small room, but I can see why some people are sort of taken aback by the boldness of everything.  The room was clean and comfortable, and check-in and check-out were very efficient.  They've got a really nice television system that includes all sorts of communication and information functionality.  And the monkey-themed accents are awesome - I snapped a pic of every one I could find!",9,3,6

This property is on the extreme end of The Strip, so you will need to walk or take the monorail to get anywhere else. Valet parking is complementary and I had no issues dropping off or picking up.

Check-in was a breeze and the front desk staff were very courteous. There were multiple points at which you could tell they were not yet familiar with the idiosyncrasies of the SPG program, but they powered through just fine.

My first issue at the hotel was that they took my Suite Night Award (a guaranteed suite upgrade voucher, basically) and gave me literally the worst suite they had - a Story Superior King with parking garage view. As I was only there one night and both the hotel and casino were practically a ghost town, I have no idea why they didn't have anything better available, but oh well... it was a suite.

Next was breakfast on offer for those that receive it complementary... As you might expect at the more value oriented properties in the Starwood portfolio, they only offered continental - no protein to speak of - so I passed on it. This, from a supposed resort?

Which brings me to the resort fee, which you pay even if you book a night on points. There were no amenities covered by this fee which you don't get as an SPG platinum or with many corporate rates. They will not waive this, even when they've closed some of their facilities for the season. Many properties charge this, but here I felt it was more egregious.

Finally, the room itself was mediocre. For a multi-million dollar renovation, I was not impressed, at least with the Story Tower. There were gobs of contemporary furniture (translucent plastic couches with colored lights inside!) and gaudy decor (how can we get more chrome in here!), but still the space was maybe 30% utilized, they didn't even have anything on the walls. It was almost as if they went over budget and left the rooms incomplete.

I might stay here again, but only as a last resort and with a guaranteed room in the Lux or World Towers. Never with family though, for that I'll stay at the Westin.",0,0,0

I come to Las Vegas every year during this time to attend the CES event. I recently came across this hotel, since it was recently remodeled, I figured I would give it  a try. Typically I check in early and always call the hotels ahead of time to ensure that I can check in early, I have done this with the Rio and Luxor for the past two years attending the CES show. After I spoke with a representative, I was excited to stay at a new hotel. Today, January 8th, I called around  7:30 a.m. to let the front desk know I was close by and was planning to check in early, as I had noted during the reservation process, the day I made the reservations. I spoke to a Diego and he mentioned he would be placing notes on the reservation to rush the cleanup of a room. When I arrived, the front desk employee Magda, said there were no rooms available. I mentioned to her that I need to get ready so I can head to the convention as quickly as possible. Unfortunately she did not assist me in any way, shape, or form in getting me a room. I then asked for a manager. She had Crystal speak with me and she simply  reiterated what Magda had said to me. Not only that, but she was being short, had a sassy attitude, and she made me feel unwelcomed at this hotel. Now for being my first time at this hotel, since the rebranding, it has already given me a bad experience. Very dissapointing as I was thinking of staying  here throughout the times I plan on coming this year, instead of Westgate (formally LVH). But with this bad experience I definitely do not want to come back. At this moment I am still in the lobby waiting for our room. I wish the manager, Crystal, could have done something for me.

I have visited the Beverly Hills Location to eat at the Bazaar but could never afford to stay there so I was so excited to learn of the SLS Las Vegas having affordable pricing. I have wanted to stay here for a while and was able to book a birthday stay. I had great communication from Crystal and Emelda and a few other staff members prior to my stay so I was already anticipating a lovely adventure. From the moment you arrive you are greeted with genuine warmth and friendliness.  As you step into the hotel it's a feast for the senses. As you walk in you see a giant Marilyn Monroe blowing a pink chewing gum bubble and everywhere you turn there is something fun to discover. Christopher checked us in and was amazing. He was friendly and informative and had a wonderful room planned for us.  I highly recommend the LUX Tower High Floor Corner Room. We splurged a little but it was so worth it and still extremely reasonable for a weekend. The room is enchanting, bubbly, warm, and playful. There are so many little details to make guests feel special. Perfect for a romantic stay. The rooms are filled with these fun curtains on the wall and there is a chaise lounge that covers the entire wall. There are fun antique looking wine glasses, chandeliers and a fun table with eclectic chairs. There is a mirror on the ceiling and a peek a boo shower that you can draw the curtain to see into the glass or leave the curtain down. The shower is huge and absolute luxury with the rain forest shower head as well as a regular shower head. I am a bath person but this shower didn't disappoint. The ironing board has a monkey on it and there are robes and slippers. The toiletries are from the Ceil spa and fabulous. The towels are lush and soft and there are plenty of them. This room includes turn down service as well. The bathroom has a fun sink and huge light up mirror. We were on the 21st floor which was great. I highly recommend booking a high floor room. When I booked it was only $4 more for the high floor. We were facing the stratosphere which was cool, plus we had a great view of the mountains. We had the best view possible as the hotel does not face the strip so we were happy. The corner room has a little more room and more windows, plus its nice because its on the end. Oh and did I mention the bed? Most comfortable bed ever with memory foam pillows and luxurious bedding. It's such a great room to spend time in you never want to leave. Jonathan from the bell desk brought our luggage up and was just charming. He spent tons of time with us and showed us how the menus for the restaurants are on the television. He offered to get us some ice and was upbeat and genuine throughout our interaction. The whole hotel is fun to be in. Here are the places we visited and loved:

1. Center bar-Has a cool 3-d image coming from the ceiling and a fun lounge area in the casino. When we were there they had $5 summer drink specials with muddled blackberries that were amazing. 
2. Cleo-I wrote a separate review for this one so I will just say that it is to die for. Best food I have had in a while if ever. Its Mediterranean Tapas. 
3. 800 degrees-Fantastic build your own pizza with the freshest finest ingredients and very cheap. Our pizza was $13 and was easily enough for two people.
4. Lux pool-Nice family atmosphere and quieter than the Foxtail party pool which is cool too.
5. The photography museum is fun.
6. The monkey bar-great drinks, great live entertainment, great outside patio, great atmosphere with the pictures of monkeys everywhere. It's nice to have a lobby bar like hotels used to. 
7. Perc-Coffee shop with amazing coffee and pastries. 
8. Room service-Fantastic.
9. Casino-Its quaint but perfectly large enough and has a good vibe. They have a lot of newer machines too. 

If you join the code which is their players club you get $30 towards food the month of your birthday and you can get rooms up to 40% off. I also got a package that included a $125 drink credit and the code is good for any of the SLS hotel locations.

They also give you a cool book at check in with tons of buy one get one free food and drink items and free admission to various locations in the hotel. 

All and all this hotel is a must try. I don't know about the smaller less expensive rooms in the world and story tower so I can't comment on those but the Lux tower is fabulous. There is security at the elevators and you need your key to press your floor which is nice. All of the staff we encountered in every department from the valet to bell service to check in to restaurants, pool, and anywhere in between were just lovely.  I also love how they kept the integrity of the Sahara by keeping the pictures of Frank Sinatra and the Rat pack when they stayed there. The hotel has so much history and its special to be in its presence  My grandparents said they used to stay there for $12 a night so its fun to stay in a remodeled hotel that still has history.",1,0,1

I tend to ""forgive"" bad places I visit and move on quickly but after visiting the SLS Las Vegas I feel obligated to rate this place. 

First, I am from Los Angeles and frequent the SLS here. I have also been to the hotel in  San Francisco designed by the same guy who did the SLS in Vegas and LA. This designer's vision and creativity is out of this world. Both LA and San Fran hotels will leave guests speechless. SLS Vegas is completely different than this designer's previous work. I would go as far to say its a cheap imitation. 

The entire hotel has carpeting. You will not see any type of fancy floors anywhere. There is ZERO attention payed to details. Main floor bathrooms are blah!! The ceiling is unfinished and painted black in the main floor. There are a few cheesy chairs here and there throughout the casino that don't even look like they belong. Graffiti style painting on the walls. This place is a very cheap imitation of the LA SLS. The rooms are also cheap looking and small. 

As far as design, elegance, and innovation is concerned, this place cannot compete with resorts like Wynn or Bellagio. The SLS Vegas is accurately located across the street from Circus Circus...it's true competition. 

Guests should not be asked to pay more than $50 a night here.  This place lacks soooooooo much aesthetically that we ended up spending all of our time and money at the Wynn.  I can't imagine anyone above the age of 25 appreciating this hotel. It's like parking a Honda among a fleet of Phantoms.",4,1,0

My boss got upgraded to a  Lux Signature Double Suite for $100 more a night but honestly the room itself wasn't any bigger (waste of money) 

For all you LA peeps, all the restaurants @ SLS are restaurants we have here in LA (Cleo, Katsuya, Umami, 800 degrees, etc) so if you want something ""different"" you'll need to go to the strip. Which brings me to my 2nd point, the SLS it's pretty far from the strip. About a $10-$20 taxi ride ONE WAY. 

They only have one cafe inside that serves coffee in the morning (The Perq). Since I was there for Magic, the line for coffee was ridiculously long (about a 30 min wait)   also, I paid $2 for a banana...the bananas was overripe & had to throw it away. The croissants are good :)

Traffic on Sahara and the Strip all messed up because of a Rock in Rio music festival Strip road closures later in the evening.  I used the Paradise Road entrance to the self parking the rest of my stay at SLS and Paradise Road is a lot more civilized than the Strip.  I recommend using that entrance to SLS if you're driving or hailing a cab.  Self parking became painless.  

Check in was fine.  Pounding dance music in the casino in the former Sahara Hotel and the pool area too.  Fred Segal of Beverly Hills stores open late at night.  Everything downstairs looks like it was gutted and completely remodeled.  The rooms are probably the same size as before, but totally remodeled.  Very modern look with the bed under the bedroom window.  Lots of mirrors, absence of dressers or closet doors, and use of pocket doors made the room feel bigger than it was.  Never heard the music festival across the street because we were on the other side of the hotel.  

Changing channels on the TV was a pain because of the apparent lack of a on-screen menu programming choices.  Don't forget to use your room card to activate the elevators on the ground floor.  Check out on the TV didn't work, so we checked out by phone with the front desk.  

Got some freebies from the SLS frequent gambler card.  SLS is at the north end of the Strip and is served by the Monorail.",0,1,2

I was excited to stay here, but when checked in I was so utterly disappointed. The hotel seems like it's trying too hard. The room is tiny, the ceiling is unfinished and the windows had mini blinds, bathroom was so weird having the sink in the outside of the room. You can't  even wash your hands immediately after using the toilet, instead you have to slide the door first. How unsanitary is that? 

Then as we get into the bed the bed was missing fitted sheets. I called front desk they sent housekeeping to give us the sheets to put it on ourselves. WTF, I didn't come here to pay for a room and to put on the sheets on myself. Then called front desk again, they send other people up and this time they say beds don't come with fitted sheets....lol I asked housekeeping why front desk didn't just tell me this on the phone, their reply was they probably don't know. Wow, goes to show how they've got things together at this hotel. 

This is my first and last time here. Looks like this hotel won't last long. SLS you need to stay as a small hotel and not compete in Las Vegas. The hotels here are for the big dogs and you're not a fit for Vegas!!!",3,2,0

Used the Hotel Tonight app and got a room Friday night for like $64 (resort fee not included).  Spent roughly $90 for one night, give or take a dollar or two. 

The room was designed in a modern fashion with plenty of space.  Very clean.  A big comfortable bed and equally large television with a high definition clear picture.  Chic layout.  The bathroom had a very nice walk in shower and plenty of clean towels and toiletries.  Well lit.

The casino itself was also clean and has all the necessary games.  Friendly staff and dealers.  I like the overall design of the hotel, it doesn't have any gimmicks, just a nice sharp look to it.  A small yet cozy sportsbook.  I didn't go to any of the clubs or restaurants in the hotel, but there seem to be plenty.  Good location on the strip.  I'd stay here again.",21,9,19

I'm amazed to see the low ratings here due to sore-loser gamblers who happened to befall bad luck on the tables, or others giving one star and\/or complaining about construction for their short stat and penalizing the hotel's efforts to improve the experience for Starwood guests.

I appreciate SPG bed, amenities, vibe and level of service here.  Valet, front desk to restaurant staff are all friendly and prompt.

I'm a firm believer in getting one chance to make a first impression and as soon as I park my car and unload, I realize the parking lot elevators are broken. As if carrying luggage down 4 flights isn't bad enough, we get to the check in counter and it literally took each front desk person an average of 20 minutes to check in each guest, us included. Finally, we get to the room and I will say the ambiance is nice, but the room sizes are tiny. Turning on the tv and it says it has a ""server error"" aka it doesn't work.

I assumed housekeeping would see the dirty carpet and take care of it when they made up my room. They did not. And, they removed the washcloth without leaving another. My room was devoid of any washcloths. I called housekeeping and asked them to bring up two washcloths. They promptly sent up another two full sets of towels. I used Nicole, the concierge,  to get show tickets, help me with a spa reservation,  and make restaurant recommendations. She was a shining star and exceeded my service expectations. I chose to eat breakfast at the Northside Cafe. It was a bad choice. $10 soupy oatmeal with raisins and brown sugar. For $10, I would expect a few nuts and a bit of banana.  So in lieu of the same lackluster breakfast experience,  the next morning I opted to order a pot of coffee thru room service. You cannot get a pot of coffee, only a cup of coffee. Ugh.  I went back downstairs to brave breakfast and watched as  another diner sent his breakfast back because it was not prepared properly, I heard the waiter call him a ""Motherf=%_er"" to the other staff.

I paid for it in full so he wouldn't have anything to worry about. If I hadn't done this, I would have moved him after one night at this joke of a hotel.
I decided on this particular hotel as it had just been newly renovated and only open since August. There were amenities that i specifically wanted for him as he is on a fitness regime. Beautiful pool, new gym....what they forgot to mention is that the pool closes at sundown and the gym is locked @ 6pm....What?
Also, the woman on the phone said the location is excellent as it is on the monorail route and therefore he wouldn't have to use his car much. Heads up...she forgot to mention that the monorail stops running @ 2am.
He had to use his car all the time and the garage has a broken elevator....Hope you like stairs.
No coffee maker in the room. Get acquainted with the 7-11 if you want your morning coffee. The guy at 7-11 even laughed when they came in and said, ""You must be staying at SLS"".

Saved the best for last...
As I said before, the room was charged and paid in full to my credit card. When he went to check out they had DOUBLED the bill. 
Through all this NOT ONE person said they were sorry. When he said the air conditioner was not working the service tech wanted to argue that it was fine.
The TV stopped working and they said no one was available until my son knew he would be asleep.
When I called to talk to someone about the various issues at 7pm I was informed that no manager was on duty after being on hold for 15 minutes.

I've been to his other properties and they have been amazing.  The SLS is not amazing - far from it.  It feels like a cheap, tacky version of a trendy hotel.  The lobby is small and uninspired with absolutely no seating, no atmosphere, an ok looking bar, a generic coffee bar and two very ugly shops.  

I specifically reserved a non-pink room & was checked into a pink room.  Didn't have time to deal with a room change, so I dealt with it.  There is no dresser and only a small closet with no door.  Also, no luggage rack - just a small log to awkwardly balance your suitcase on.

The absolute worst part of my stay was the couple hours I spent poolside on a Saturday afternoon.  First off, the pool area looks like a dilapidated circus.  Everything is striped and sun-bleached.  It's not stylish.  At all.  There are no servers.  If you want a $16 drink, you have to go to the bar yourself and get it.  I ordered food and was told to check back at the bar in 10 minutes to see if it was ready.  Whaaat??  But what made this experience so painful was the H-O-R-E-N-D-O-U-S  dj'd music blasting the entire time.  And I like music.  All kinds of music.  But this was like music from a never-ending R&B T&A video.  And it never varied.  And it was really loud.  

Apparently, there is another pool on the roof but it was ""closed for the season.""  Why would you close a pool when it's 80-90 degrees and sunny every day?  

A few plusses:

The two people I dealt with at the front desk were friendly & professional.

I ate at two of the restaurants there - Bazaar Meat and Katsuya.  Both have amazing happy hour specials 5-7pm with 1\/2 priced drinks and food items in their bar area.  The food at both these places was OUTSTANDING and a great value.",1,1,0

They have no bed side manor what so ever.

Or you could say the hotel is clean, the rooms feature a nice minimalist design and there's a cool ""LA"" feel to it.  Got that, too.

But at the end of the day, SLS charges a very fair price for the experience offered compared to other hotels on the strip.   There's the Cosmopolitan, Wynn and Mandarin further down the strip if you think the SLS amenities don't live up to your expectations.  And then there's Circus Circus if you think SLS charges too much for their rooms and services.

I agree, being that we had to start getting ready for a concert that same night. As we enter the room, my fiancé notices we are in a handicap room....somehow homeboy at the front desk forgot to mention this. Immediately we go back down to the front desk and ask for a different room. Then we are told we would have to wait for at least an hour for a king room to be available (oh and this was past check in time at 3pm) unless we wanted to pay $30 per night to upgrade. Reluctantly we agreed so we wouldn't be late to the concert. Finally settled in our ""upgraded"" room, we take in our surroundings...bed in the middle of the room, concrete ceiling and the bathroom in 3 different sections making up the entire back wall behind the bed. The toilet and shower are covered by sliding mirror doors, so if you're standing at the tiny sink you might want to give a warning to your fiancé so you don't get hit in the head by the door...which actually happened to us.

To start off, I thought this was going to be a great experience, BUT it wasn't. I've never been to a hotel, with such TERRIBLE service. The poolside DJ, talk about a stuck up BUTTHOLE, who plays songs off of iTunes, you're real cool BRO on your MAC BOOK. My sister asked for a song request and rather than the DJ being polite and saying I don't have that song, he insulted her. For being a poolside DJ, who can't even get the crowd moving, let alone get a crowd in the first place. He sure should NOT talk. SLS, you are better off hooking an iPod up to the sound system, than pay that butthole, and i mean butthole, because he sure does know how to POOP on a good time. 

Feeling insulted by an employee of the hotel, I felt the need to let the hotel know their staff member was  completely out of line, and above all RUDE. And yes, the hotel felt sympathetic and apologized, BUT, they didn't do anything about it. NOTHING. Go figure... 

So I am doing something about it. Everyone who has written a NEGATIVE review, and the reviews are mostly about the staff and how bad they are. PLEASE TAKE THEIR ADVICE.

The room is very nice and bougie-it's decorated in a Victorian-y elegant design, and everything was all white, which is classy!

Even though it's off the strip, the monorail stop is there and can take you as far as MGM and makes drinking and traveling the strip super fun. I loved how unique all the decorations were and even though the room was small , everything inside was nice and I LOVE the huge light up mirrors , if staff of SLS could please tell me where I can buy them I so will! 

We were there the grand opening of the Foxtail pool party club and didn't even know it . The staff hooked us up with poolside Chairs with no minimums and we enjoyed great surround systems and got to see Rebecca and Fiona live.  I had no clue if you were a guest, they don't have you pay cover to get in . 

I wish we could have checked out Life but we already were going to Xs at the Wynn to see Kaskade (WHOLE purpose of the trip) but we were having so much fun at the Sls we almost ditched our pre paid Kaskade tickets to check it out ! 

The pizza place, coffee and Umami are all great, but would definitely need to travel elsewhere if i stayed 3 nights to eat . Ordering pizza at the pizza place we found confusing . We just wanted a regular pizza with sauce and cheese and for some reason that was a pain in ass to order lol 

ANYWAYS long story short I can see why the yelp reviews are negative , it does not live up to the classy Beverly Hills SLS vibe , but it doesn't cost as much either . For the value I think it's a great deal ,?especially when you look around for a good deal. 

The only annoying thing that everybody whose been here would agree is coming down on the elevators during peak times like 11AM check out , the elevator stops at EVERY single row and is jam packed and people get annoyed.

Had dinner at Cleo with a group of 8 people. Our food was cleared from the table before some were finished with their dishes. My friend's drink had visibly rotten fruit in it. We asked the server to surprise our friend with a dessert for her birthday, but got the check instead. The manager did try to help and make up for it, but we were all ready to leave by then. 

I guess the cherry on top this time around was the fact that my necklace (white gold with diamonds) was stolen from my room. Saturday morning, a housekeeping woman came into my room and we politely said that we did not want any housekeeping. A few hours later we got ready to leave the room and since we said we didn't want any housekeeping, we left our personal belongings out (my necklace, an expensive handbag with credit cards etc, iPad). Upon arrival, we see the room is clean and my necklace is missing. Hotel security came up and took a report, but pretty much said that this is ""typical"" in Vegas and that they will run an investigation through ""risk management""... Meanwhile, it's been two days and I still haven't heard from the hotel. I asked to speak to a hotel manager upon checking out and told her the story... She then asked me if I had told the housekeeping supervisor or anyone else that I didn't want housekeeping before leaving my stuff out...

stayed at the the for 5 nights in a World Tower (high floor) king room.

rooms: 4 stars - rooms were comfortable and nicely appointed, but not luxurious. bathrooms and showers were nice.

service: 2 stars - housekeeping was VERY slow and inconsistent.

food: griddle house - similar situation, food was very good but the service was horrible. we ate at 6AM (Before a tour) with only 2 other people in the entire restaurant. our waitress disappeared for about 20 minutes. turns out the ENTIRE wait staff was in a room eating their breakfast while no one was serving tables.

issues we had were:
- room keys were inactivated (for us and another couple travelling with us)
- computer glitch wiped out my wife's information on our reservation
- 40 minute wait to sign up for the players club (we already signed up on line and just needed the cards). employees were standing around and not helping customers. 
- concierge desk was not helpful in resolving room card key issues while there was a long line at the reservation desk.

make sure to clarify pick up or drop off locations with cabs or tours. most drop you at the main entrance which is NOWHERE near registration area.so you have to haul your bags all the way through the casino. there is a another entrance right by the registration desk, so make sure to ask and get dropped off there if you are checking in.

security \/ greeters kind of just stand there and don't help guests, there is not enough signage in the hotel to tell you where to go. there is literally ZERO signs telling you where the front desk is.",1,0,0

It's not the typical hype and fast pace that Vegas brings... I'm sure that's mostly because it is away from all the action. I was surpringly happy with my staycation at the SLS. The property is very small and the details are not nearly as refined as other Vegas hotels, but for the price it was perfect! 

There are 3 towers on the property and each has a different decor and theme. I stayed in the Story Tower and it lived up to its name! I don't know how else to put this than to say, the story tower rooms are pretty much a SEX PAD! Not like anything else I've seen in Vegas! They are small, under 400 square feet - but they are modern and ultra cool. At first glance it felt cheap, but at second thought it is brilliant really! Concrete walls and ceiling - blocks out noise between rooms. White plastic furniture: headboard and sofa - but they have lights with dimmer switches which create some awesome mood lighting! The doors to he shower and bathroom are mirrored sliding doors with views of the bed. And the best and craziest feature of all is the giant mirror hung on the ceiling above the bed!! Don't stay here with your mother! (You've officially been warned!)

The property boasts 2 restaurants by José Andrés: Bazaar Meat & Ku Noodle, a burger joint: Unami Burger, a pizza place: 800 Degrees, a cafe: Northside Cafe, a Japanese Restaurant: Katsuya by Starck Cleo, and a coffee shop: The Perk. For a smaller property you cannot find better food! I'll review the restaurants separately, but I enjoyed the food at several places.

The Monkey Bar is a quiet little hang out. It was dead the entire weekend, but the cocktails were nothing short of wonderful. They have a small little patio off the bar which was perfect for enjoying a cigar.

I went to the pool twice. Saturday it was pumping with live DJ and all, it was free cover which was awesome! Sunday however it was dead and relaxing, great if you're hung over, not great if you're looking to party more. There is a second pool that's family friendly but I didn't spend any time there.

I got lost trying to find my car because there are 2 parking garages, but all in all I have few complaints. The Monarail will take you as far as MGM Grand which is convenient since the SLS is clear on the far end of the strip. I will 100% be staying at the SLS again!",21,8,13

Our room was tiny, which is fine, but details matter in small spaces and it seems like the people who approved the renovation didn't actually sleep in a mock up of a room before giving it the green light. In order of annoyance: 

1. The windows are old, drafty, and even on the 23rd floor, let in a lot of street noise - cars honking, people yelling, motorcycles. Luckily (or not) the fan is extremely loud so it'll drown the noise if you turn it on. 

2. The night stand has two outlets for electronics, but they're both covered by the clock radio plug, which I had to unplug in order to charge my phone, and explains why the clock time was wrong when I checked into the room. 

3. The shower door is on the wrong side of the shower, meaning you have to fully get into the shower in order to turn it on and adjust the temperature settings. 

4. The toilet paper is more than 2 feet from the toilet. 

5. The shower water faucet knob was installed incorrectly so the hot water arrow doesn't help you figure out which way to turn for hot water. 

6. The shampoo\/conditioner\/body wash\/lotion are large - nearly 3.3 ounces. That's awesome, except they all have annoying little stickers that have to be peeled off and there's nothing alerting guests to the fact that they can bring their unused stuff home rather than trashing\/wasting it - most people don't know that the TSA limit is 3.3 ounces. 

7. There are no prices displayed for the minibar and snacks. 

8. There are no robes, no bathtub, the pool is closed for the season, and no hot tub. All would be fine if I hadn't schlepped around Vegas on my feet all day. This hotel is 3 miles from the center of the strip - they should expect people to get here tired and wanting to relax. 

9. There are small lights that stay on 24\/7 on the mirrors. 

- Check-in staff were nice, but when I asked for details about the monorail - where it went, when, and for how much, our check-in person didn't know and told us to go outside to the monorail site for information.They should have a brochure of information available at the front desk.",0,0,0

Really just one. The service. The employees here seem miserable and not super competent. (We had awesome service in the 'north side cafe' and that's it.) Service at 800 degrees was terrible - the employees were grumpy and not helpful. The servers at the 'monkey bar' were slooooow and didn't know anything about the drinks.

Stay in the Lux tower if you stay here! 

On check-in day, we were a bit worn out from partying the night before, so we headed down to the pool area, which was really nice and the pool is heated so a lot of people were still swimming and laying out in the sun. It's a nice place to just chill out and relax, which turns into a party spot at night.

Thumping club music mid day with cursing and n-word dropped twenty plus times per song.  Pool side service was non existent. I got up, found a server and they said they would get back to me. 25 minutes later I got up and went to the bar.  One beer and one cocktail $25 before tip.  I guess that's to be expected in Vegas.  Left after an hour, music was too much.  Ate dinner at Bazaar Meats.  Unbelievable experience. Service and food unbelievable!  Next day went to the beer garden and waited over ten minutes at the bar with no one to be found.  Left after one drink.

Went to Umami burger for a drink, they close at 11pm.  Only two very small bars to choose from after that.

Let me also mention the lights and lasers that shine in my room.  Before being put on hold she did tell me it should wrap up at 4am.  What happened to 2am?  I already got earplugs the day before. They told me I had to buy them In the store, then I questioned them and they brought them right up for free.  After being on hold for 15 minutes ""to see what they could do"" I gave up.

My boyfriend slander I stayed in the world tower and it was pretty spacious for just the two us. We originally were booked in the story tower but I saw pictures and videos and the set up looked HORRIBLE. I did not like anything about it and so we rebooked for the world tower (check out youtube videos before bookong!!)

Now, upon arrival the place was very easy to find and we navigated pretty easily through the hotel. When we checked in we were told that all the non smoking rooms were unavailable and they only had smoking rooms. I hate the smell of smoke and always make note to request for a NON smoking room. So the front desk girl offered to down grade me us to the story (the room I hated) for a non smoking room.. uhmmm. What? You want to down grade us? She said we could stay there for the night and then switch rooms the next day. Not okay!!! How do you give away our room and then offer to DOWN grade us?
We decided to suck it up and just take the smoking room and prayed that there wasn't a lingering smell of smoke. Thankfully there wasnt!
Walking to our room it was a little dark due to lighting and decor, not gonna lie it was pretty creepy. But not horrible.
The next morning we we're rudely awakened around 8 am by some neighbors arguing.. LOUDLY.. it was a lot of screaming and things being slammed around and threats back and forth.  So we called security and they did not sound like there was any urgency to calm down the situation. About 30+ mins later the next door room was quiet, but I don't think it was security that stopped them because maybe an hour later they were back..

All in all I would be willing to give this place another chance, it was decently priced and I will say they can't control the guests.. but they should definitely have a bit more sense of urgency when it comes to security.

But Super Luxurious Sex fit better than whatever the other S's stands for. See? I don't even remember.

The first thing you notice upon walking in is how chic this place feels. That mood is carried over when you enter your room to find illuminated mirrors (rumor mill was swirling that there are mirrors above the beds, not cool if you have kids that wonder what that's for) big ass 50-inch flat screens and interior designs that seems like someone actually planned this out.

There are 2 pools here. The foxtail which is paid entrance and is the reason why you came to take pool-side selfies for. It's big as hell and I'm sure you're gonna find yourself swimming in piss with these pools.

The luxury pool is smaller and a little more private. Upon entering you realize the deuchery (is this a word) of Vegas by having the cheapest thing on the menu being a $400 of vodka leading up to $250,000 of Ace of Spades champagne. Yes. The price of a fucking house.

Anyways, being memorial day weekend, we decided to jump in the pool. There were inflatable beach balls scattered in the pool. A friendly game of catch and what-not pursued.

After a few hours somehow someway (Vegas magic?) one side started battling with the other, so we'd slap these damn balls (no homo) to each other and it got pretty competitive. There were casualties of war, unfortunately. We'd accidentally hit a few people along the way that were lounging pool-side.

It got to the point where apparently people complained and secooooority (Rick James voice) had to intervene and tell us to calm down; coming back 30 minutes later saying the same thing. I took it upon myself to be the fun police by telling everyone in the pool 'NO SPLASHING'. You know. Making the snitches by the pool hate me even more. 

Logic tells you this: You don't want people to have fun at the pool? Take away these 10 beach balls that are lying in the pool. 2) If you came to relax get the fuck back to your room. Close the door. Shut the blinds. Finger your butt and sleep the whole time you're here.

Needless to say this killed the fun and I knocked off a star.

I knocked off another star because cell phone service is atrocious. Having to pay for wifi is a joke. I'd barely get a few bars at most and everyone else had the same experience.

There is a monorail that connects you to the rest of the strip so at least you don't have to drop down 3 figures on taxi rides your whole weekend.

On a personal note: I'm sure this end of the strip is loving the attention SLS is bringing. Mainly cause no one wants to stay at Circus Circus, you know? I'm sure the old hotels are struggling now cause of SLS and more to come, I'm sure.

I'd write more but there's pretty much nothing else to say that other people haven't. Plus I don't remember 25% of my stay.

My original 3-star review dropped to 2 stars because I just remembered room service sucking.

They knocked on our door and I asked her to come back in an hour or so. She never did. In fact, we didn't have anyone stop by all throughout our stay. Luckily I asked her for towels on the spot cause we would have run out without them.",4,6,2

The hotel, however, needs some improvement.  The first night we had to call someone at 2AM to come fix our AC (it still never worked), and the second night was just a mess. The power went out at least 5 times throughout the night; the hotel blamed this on something outside of their hotel but I have my doubts. The biggest concern though was that when the power went out and we couldnt get up to the hotel room, they said we couldn't use the stairs. It didn't seem like they had an emergency back up generator which I'm not sure is even legal or meets the standards. Then our fire alarm was beeping constantly (batteries needed replacing) and it took two hours for someone to come fix it- note this was at night when we were trying to sleep.

I stayed here on a business trip and it was the perfect place to stay to make use of the meeting rooms, food hall, and work. The Wi-Fi could have been a bit better but it wasn't as bad as many other similar events I have attended. This is a great place to stay if you're at an event and not going to do much sleeping (Ex. EDC, etc.) and are not looking for the fancy hotel experience (family vacation, work, etc.)

The rooms are cozy and I roomed with my coworker with double queen beds. They have huge full wall mirrors that have lights bordering the outside perfect for getting ready. The beds were also really comfy. 

The Foxtail club is located at the SLS. We didn't check it out but probably will next time. There's an Umami Burger restaurant near the tables and we ate here immediately!",2,0,2

Friends and I booked two hotel rooms (Kings in the World Tower) and there were hiccups right from the get-go. Check-in was almost pain-free, so I'll skip the complaining about that, but everything went down-hill from there.

This is one of the cheapest hotels you can stay at on the Strip, and by that I mean the hotel is cheap in their amenities and overall what you'd expect in any decent hotel. They don't (or didn't, as I found out later) provide any toothbrush\/toothpaste\/mouthwash\/soap\/comb\/showercap or anything of that sort and they have sensors on water. If you pick up anything more than 60 seconds it automatically gets charged to your room. $16.00 or so for peanuts, I don't think so. What am I, the peanut queen?!

Also, if you have some form of OCD, I'd avoid these rooms like the plague. Their idea of modern is running bi-colored wall paper everywhere and putting oversize mirrors on all the walls. They have so many mirrors because their rooms are SMALL! Don't even get me started on their slanted mirror-desk and their horrible use of bathroom space (who thought it was a good idea to put a towel hook above the toilet???). Really, I've expected and seen much better from Mr. Stark. Sooooooo not fengshui OK.

World Tower acoustics and ventilation were also horrible. Their club is located right across the World Tower so if you want to sleep before 03:00, don't stay in a room with a ""view."" The noise just seeps through the windows while you have creepy people looking at you from their ""contemporary"" blinds. If people run and smoke in the hallways, you'll definitely hear and smell it. 

Service throughout the stay was hit or miss. Christina from the late night front desk was awesome and understanding, so I want to put that out there. The security people that check your cards to enter the elevators and the gym\/spa attendants were always helpful and nice. I felt the valets were pretty useless though, but the most annoying part was during check-out. I wanted to leave a comment praising Christina for how she quickly and graciously handled my noise complaint, but the dude at the counter started wiping down his keyboard and made no eye-contact. Not a huge deal, except for the fact that it's the front desk and I'm trying to do something nice, so I'd appreciate if the guy listened. He finally said that comment cards were in the room (but there definitely were none) and to ""just post something online."" 

I also asked why there were no bathroom amenities provided and he said ""you should have requested it"" in a very snappy way. Rude and disrespectful. I went back to speak with the manager and apparently she was ""busy"" and would call me back. She never called and I'm still upset about what should have been an easy-going stay with friends.

They don't have adequate customer service and it sucks for the employees that really are doing fabulous jobs. Hotel goers cannot voice their praises or opinions internally and must resort to doing something public like this. I was told to post on Facebook, Trip Advisor, and Yelp, so that's what I'm going to do.

The hotel is made up of 3 towers:
1. World Tower (Lowest end, your usual hotel room-nothing special)
2. Story Tower  (Mid end, very small, European-ish styled rooms with mirror on ceiling)
3. Luxe Tower  (High end, most expensive, only tower with the pink rooms you see in pictures)

We ended up staying in the Story Tower, which we were told was an upgrade so we should be happy.  The room was very small, not somewhere you want to stay when you go with a group of friends.  

Overall,  the pictures on the website and even on yelp are a bit misleading.  They lead you to believe you will stay in the nicely decorated pink rooms in the luxe tower, but you probably won't unless you want to pay a premium.  The hotel was almost at the end of strip, so far from all the fun stuff.  I give it 3 stars because the hotel was OK and I got what I payed for.

I stayed here for Halloween weekend. It was very, very busy. The check in was much easier than the checkout. It appeared that many people had problems with their bills. The hotel is actually a couple of blocks from the Stratosphere. Although it is far down the strip, the monorail stop leads to the doors of the SLS hotels. I thought that was nice!

I stayed in a World Superior King and it looked just like the picture on the website. I thought the room was a decent size (despite previous reviews). I loved the room, I just wish they had blackout curtains. Even with the shade drawn light seeps through. The mini bar is ridiculously priced, and there is no coffee maker, fridge. I know it is Vegas, but that would have made the room better.

SLS has complimentary WI-FI but it was HORRIBLE! 

They do charge $150 per night on your credit card (I knew ahead of time because of the reviews) I thought that was a bit much especially because the hotel is not that upscale. If you can use a CREDIT CARD and not a debit card, the funds were immediately released back to my credit card.",3,0,1

Its their job to keep solicitors, peddlers, and unwanted persons, aka homeless people, off property. 
FAILURE # 1 (security)

After being greeted by the homeless person, the valet attendant approached our vehicle and very rudely instructed us to go to the other valet entrance if we needed the assistance of a bellman. 
FAILURE # 2 (valet)

After having to go all the way around the entire property to get to the appropriate entrance we finally were able to valet our car, have the bellman take our bags, and check-in to our room. After doing all that, we arrived to the elevator corridor which was floor to ceiling mirrors, very stunning and in true SLS fashion, only problem was, one of the walls had huge cracks and breaks in the mirror which were covered up with duck tape. 
FAILURE # 3 (maintenance)

This brings us to the room. Words cannot describe my disappointment. I partly blame myself for having such high expectations because I have frequented both SLS beverly hills (my favorite), and SLS South Beach, and expected so much more from SLS Las Vegas. Where do I begin? In a nutshell this was nothing more than a soft redo of the old Sahara guest rooms. So soft, they couldnt even be bothered enough to clean out the dust, dead insects, and hair out of the window sills and tracks. Or the smell for that matter, the rooms odor was so awful (musk and mold) I had to go to the Walgreens across the street to buy a can of air freshner. After dealing with the odor, the insects, and the cum rag on the side of the bed, left behind by the previous guests I'm sure, it almost seemed unimportant that there was no phone on the night stand, no drawer space in the entire room, no closet space, no bath robes, and a non-working AC unit. I seriously felt like we were being ""punked"" I thought to myself.....""ok, for sure any minute now Sammy and Ashton are going to come out from one of these mirrors and be like, you just got punked"" because there was no way this was seriously my room, let alone a room at the SLS Las Vegas. Being a huge SBE fan and follower I would have never in my wildest dreams thought a room such as this one would be on one of their property's.  
FAILURE #4, #5, #6, and #7 (design, construction, buildout, and housekeeping)

Despite all of this, I foolishly, and against my better judgement, decided to actually sleep there. The following morning only brought more disappointment when we arrived at the pool which was so small and secluded it felt like it would be a claustrophobic persons nightmare. Not having any issues with claustrophobia, we decided to stay, only to find out that we had to retrieve our own towels. I know that doesn't sound like a big deal, but there should have at least been a towel attendant standing at the towel booth to hand them to you, rather than expect guests to reach into a laundry bin to get their own towels. To add insult to injury, when we layed the towels down onto our lounge chairs, two of them were covered in spots and stains. Again, felt like Sam and Ashton were going to pop out from one of the cabanas to ""punk"" us, but nope, no Ashton, no Sammy, just the reality of SLS Las Vegas. 
FAILURE #8 and #9 (architecture and management)

Needless to say, we couldn't have been more disappointed by it all so we checked out, less than 24 hours after arriving for our two night stay. Didn't surprise me in the least when the registration associate didn't ask why were checking out early because I'm sure it happens ALL the time.

I actually really liked the fact that it's off the strip, less noise and nicer people.  Check in was super quick and they even let us check in a little early.  When getting to our room we realized we had a great view of the Stratosphere and all the people jumping from it.  At night you could see the rides going, which was pretty cool.  

The biggest con to this hotel was the fact that the bathroom is split into three sections.  The first section was the toilet, then the sink, then the shower....all behind sliding mirrors.  So you couldn't have one person on the toilet and the other brushing their teeth or you'd end up hitting the person brushing their teeth with a heavy mirror.  Something about the mirror really threw me off, especially the one above the bed.  I suppose it'd be okay if you were thin, but I looked like a manatee.  

My other very big issue was one of the pool security guys.  I was told I could take in water\/anything that wasn't glass at 9am (which I totally understand).  At 10 I wasn't feeling particularly great (it was 100 degrees out) so I went and grabbed a coke.  When I went to enter the pool again I was told that I couldn't take it in, by someone else.  I of course was beyond frustrated and told Mr. Cranky Pants that he needed to go in and take everyone else's drinks away.  Heck a woman brought in her own bottle of vodka.  He let me through that ""one time"".  He just didn't need to be so aggressive with his approach.  

We ended up being charged for something out of the mini fridge however it was removed when we checked out.  Another small annoyance was the fact there was no microwave or refrigerator in the room.  

The biggest reason I give 3 stars is because we were given late checkout with no additional charge.  I had the beginning stages of heat stroke and our flight home wasn't until 9pm so I couldn't be outside for the rest of the day.  The nice gentleman at the checkout allowed us to stay until 3pm.  I did appreciate this part of the stay and might reconsider staying here again in the future.",2,1,0

A few years back I was pretty happy to hear that someone had bought out the old Sahara hotel which had been sitting empty for years and was planning to redesign it into a chic boutique hotel. The north end of the Strip has been pretty dead so any new development is more than welcome. Flash forward to today as we are coming up to the one year anniversary of SLS and its clear that something is still lacking.

Despite the $415 million spent, the SLS still looks like it needs another face lift. The layout of the floor plan and gaming floor is odd and creates a lot of dead space. The fragmented Fred Siegel stores and other shops disrupt the flow of any shopping corridor that might have existed. A fresh coat of paint and modern accessories do not change the fact that the guest rooms still feel dated and cramped. Parking garage still looks like its from the 80s and the low ceilings throughout parts of the casino remind you that SLS is just the old Sahara hotel with a body kit. The Center Bar's giant floating screen was a good idea but the screen is way to low for anyone to really appreciate it. All in all the quality of this resort is far below the prices it demands of it's customers. 

The restaurant selection here is excellent, far beyond what one would expect from this property. Unfortunately, slow business has forced most of the restaurants to cut hours drastically and some are closed entirely for 2-3 days out of the week. Nightlife here is average as best as both Foxtail and Life are way too small compared to the venues they try to compete with at Encore and Cosmo. 

Overall there is still a lot of potential at SLS and hopefully it is realized when Resorts World opens nearby, until then make sure you keep your expectations in check.",6,1,2

Beautiful rooms with contemporary decor. If you like to FEEL good and have a fine experience, SLS is the perfect place. 

Pillows are filled with memory foam or goose feathers or something to that effect. Mirrors have a ring of light around them, which is a beautiful touch. 

Bathrooms are spacious. Shower head feels great. Towels are white, clean, and fluffy. 

Note: Do not store your personal items in the mini bar-- you'll incur a $30 restocking fee. 

If the W Hotel, The Standard, and The Be early Hills Hotel had a baby, SLS Las Vegas would be it. 

Oh and they give complimentary nights when you join CODE for free. 
Valet is free. Self-parking is ample. 

The nightclubs there are dope (I've gone to Life on several occasions and Sayers Club has the dopest DJs.) I haven't tried Foxtail yet. 

The customer service is nice and the guys that work the front desk AND the nightclubs are well-dressed, polite, and very serving.

This is a hotel. It is a nice hotel. It is not the MGM grand. We were able to get it for an incredibly, absurdly, cheap rate on a weekend. Yes, there is a resort fee. However, this is Las Vegas. EVERYWHERE has a resort fee. 

It is not directly in the middle of the strip. However, it maybe took 15 minutes to drive to anywhere on the strip, and 20 minutes if we wanted to go downtown. That is seriously not the end of the world, and frankly, I preferred not being in the middle of all of the drunken chaos.

The ambiance was nice, and the rooms had clearly been recently refurbished. The person who checked us in made sure to give us a non-smoking room, and also apologized for how small the room would be, and let us know we could upgrade the next day if needed; they were almost full at the time we checked in (11:30 at night, and the check-in person was really nice even at that hour). However, we saw no reason to do so; again, this is a hotel room. How much time are you spending a hotel room? There was plenty of room for both of us, the bed was comfortable, there was a television we never bothered to turn on (because we are in Las Vegas...), there were multiple mirrors to help get ready in and out of the bathroom, and the bathroom was functional with even more mirrors, and a glass doored shower. 

Furthermore, someone whined that housekeeping was ""extremely cheap,"" because they didn't replace the toiletries the next day. 1) The toiletries were really nice, so I don't know that I would call them ""extremely cheap,"" and 2) Did you really use an entire thing of lotion, shampoo, and body wash in a day? No? Then actually, they're not cheap, you're just greedy. 

I would definitely stay here again.",3,1,1

I came here to meet two friends at the Griddle Cafe the morning they were open.  After breakfast, I took the time to roam the property and see the restaurant selection and make note of places I want to come back and try.  

The casino area was not very crowded until I was leaving because i had arrived so early.  The line for The Code--their slot club--was very long wqhen I left.  The casino is rather small compared to what it was when the hotel was the Sahara.   The emphasis here is less on gaming and more on food and entertainment.

The place has been nicely redone.  The porte-cochère is completely different and has a sculpture called SAM, for Philippe Starck's idea of Sam Nazarian.  It, along with much of the interior was designed by Starck.  He's not a fan of traditional Las Vegas slot machine toppers so he designed the faces that have tongues.  He also used Nazarian's girlfriend as a model for the entrance to Cleo.

This is a place worth coming back to for restaurant trying.  I'm not sure the LiFE Club would be something appealing to me and it wouldn't be my first choice for gaming.  But the restaurant lineup looks enticing on its own.",22,3,10

I (used to) like it but now I absolutely hate it. 

On top of that, it's at an incredibly high volume. The cocktail waitresses are nowhere to be found. We moved around to certain areas every 45 minutes and nobody was taking care of us or, apparently, other people either. Few variety of games, and expensive tables. 

Extra: Steer clear of the Umami burger joint unless you like tasteless and burnt burgers.

Felt a bit like the Cosmo (which is a good thing) for a fraction of the price. The only trade-off is that you're off the strip, and need to either catch their shuttle (which only goes until 7pm unfortunately) or the onsite sky train... Or cab of course. 
Our room was nice, but wasn't 100% clean when we got inside. I can tell the maid did a bit of rushed job. The service at the casino was stellar though. I got the vibe that the employees are really trying to earn patrons business from the strip. 
Bonus: Katsuya sushi is on their main floor. They happily served us just before they closed (they should be open later anyway on a weekend) and the quality of the fish was better than other places I've been in Vegas. 
I will definitely consider the SLS on future trips. Great value!",1,0,1

We had a great deal since SLS had a grand opening discount. We booked a double room and as we entered the room we shocked by all the pretty lights and the floor to ceiling mirrors.

One of our favorite things is that the hotel is right next to the monorail. It's a quick 3-5 minute walk to the monorail and you are off to the heart of the strip. So you are in the middle of all the action with your retreat just a quick ride on the monorail away.

1)  Music was bad and ear piercing LOUD in the casino ( I have a clinically 80% bi-lateral hearing lost-go figure that I am complaining of loud noise.  How loud was it? enough for a near deaf person to complain). 2) Pool had a party and there was a line through out the hotel. 3) Signs throughout the building that people had to wear appropriate clothing in casino area and other areas.  No bathing suits in public areas.  One woman showed her rear end exposing a dirty g string. She was in a shoe store in the hotel practically naked. One security did nothing but watch her from behind a pillar. He was being a total pervert and coward.  4) NO WIFI.  It was advertised FREE WIFI.  I got the run around and rude treatment (eye rolling from the Hotel Manager-Melissa) when I needed the WIFI for a conference ""call"" and Webinar for work.  I was even sent to ""business center"" where I would have to pay for the WIFI.  5) Black security guard did not check for the room key of black guests but he checked mine (I'm not black-did you guest this?) 6) I had security sic on me because I am Severely Hard of Hearing (from birth) and talk loud.  No understanding of people with disabilities. 7) One man from Holland was there to celebrate his daughter's 21st birthday.  He was rudely treated by hotel staff members.  8) long lines for check in and check out.  Poorly managed. 

The only good thing....the mattress was very comfortable and Jason from security actually was a nice kid and understood that I truly could not hear especially over the noise.  Yeah poor kid...he was sent to watch a well educated (B.S and M.S. license professional who speaks three languages)  55 year old deaf white lady being too loud.  Nice kid working for bad management. 

My husband and I will not return to SLS in Las Vegas or any other SLS hotel chains after this experience.  First impressions make lasting ones.  The management did not get this right.  American Disabilities Act will be formally informed as well as a few other authorities...such as gaming authorities.  Minors were playing in the casino.  ID's were not checked and a lot of folks looked younger than 21 years of age.  This is more of a problem for the hotel management not so much for the consumer.",2,1,0

The staff service was impeccable. Everyone was very attentive. They did everything but wipe my hiney, pretty much.
The Foxtail pool, FAVORITE part of the weekend.  We rented a day bed. Well, worth the money spent. All it is is a tab minimum. Food was great, servers were sweet and attentive. Towel service was on point. Cleanliness A++! We had our kids with us and I was nervous that it would be frowned upon and that we would be neglected by the pool staff. I was wrong. We were taken care of just as well as everyone else, and the party was never dull! The music at the pool was dope! Acid jazz, funky dance beats, pop mixes, etc. The music started off a bit slow and jazzy in the morning, but we were so pumped by the afternoon. Everything from the Fresh Prince, to the Fugees, to Portishead. 
I didn't get a chance to gamble but I observed that they have all the gaming one would want. 
The TV was impressive! EASY and quick navigation through channel menu AND hotel services. You can look up ANYTHING on it. Check out was done in less than a minute on the tv.

UPDATED 12\/14\/14:  I received a free night comp because I'm a local and had gambled in the casino the opening night.  I was surprised that I was allowed to use the comp for a Saturday night because unless you're a high roller, you usually cannot. I made a same day reservation and I arrived at the hotel around 9 last night. I was quickly able to check into my room.  I received a room in the Story Tower (there are several different towers that have different room designs) and I was quite impressed.  The shower and toilet worked great and the climate control was comfortable. The bed was big and I had a great night sleep. I love the mirror above my bed so I can watch myself do the deed! :)  The casino has some of the newest slot machine games too.  I was surprised because this morning, the casino was virtually empty and not one cocktail waitress approached me and offered me a beverage.  I ate breakfast at the Griddle Café and I though the food was horrible. I wrote a separate review for that. .

I was very unhappy that the parking garage off Paradise road was closed without any clear indication as to why. This caused a traffic disaster trying to get into the hotel. I missed dinner reservations as a result. 


In any case, I had an enjoyable stay and I would consider staying here again in the future",3,2,0

I see myself hanging out there a lot, and bringing out of town guests to visit\/dine there. I decided to check it out even though I heard some rather scathing reviews from friends, and I still thought this was a really cool casino. 

I love the artwork, the design aesthetic is really cool and modern. It's very rustic warehouse, fine art meets street art.  The music is fantastic, a nice departure from some of the annoying top 40 you hear blasted all over the strip. Upbeat indie dance music. Smells good, everything is new, and the ""scene"" isn't full of annoying tourist douche bags. It's very chill, and a great place to have a conversation and a good meal with friends. It really reminds me of something you mind find in Boulder, Colorado, or perhaps Seattle. Casual, thoughtful design and food that people really like.

I should note that some people really aren't going to ""get"" SLS. It's not like other casinos on the strip, so get that out of your mind before going there. It's smaller. It doesn't have an enormous life-size-whatever-stupid-thing-people like out front. There's no aquarium or shiny car or any other stupid tourist traps to waste your money on.

It DOES have a laid-back, nice vibe, a choice of several restaurants (and plenty of meal choices in the $10-$15 a plate range), super nice staff (with cool jackets!), an awesome pool area, super sweet bars to choose from, and plenty to look at and talk about. Is this your typical over-the-top ""Vegas"" Hangover experience? No, and that's what I love about it. I will be back.

My one note for SLS management: Your aesthetic is very warehouse chic, and the bright recessed lighting just doesn't match. Yes, the ceiling is exposed, but your guests aren't on a stage! Dim the lights a little!",6,2,4

Super clean room, awesome design theme, and comfy beds.
We chose a smaller room because the price was a steal! 
I wish instead of a mini bar, there was a fridge. There was a great little safe and a shelf for storing shoes, bags, or whatever. The desk and tv were in a great place out of the way of the bed area. I enjoyed the infinity mirrors, so dang rad! going out fit selfies on point!

The concierge area, wow, can this be my house?! The couches and styling felt lime a modern minimalist dream. Most people went in for ""for the gram"" pictures. The staff was helpful and knowledgeable. 

The PERQ coffee shop was wonderful. I got majority of my meals for the conference at their to-go section, healthy choices and fresh. They also had gelato, in matcha and acai so you could make acai bowls! The staff was nice as well.

I dont drink, go to clubs, or gamble, so I cant comment on their hotel entertainment. 
I can comment on the restaurant, it wasn't that great; service was lacking, food had a hair in it, and pricey. I wish I would have went to their sushi restaurant, it had great feedback.

The main pool area was really nice, plenty of seating, and a fun vibe. I could see this being a hopping place for a pool party. The upper pool was private and had a game area, but not as ""VEGAS"" pool as they could have made it. 

The stores in the hotel were great, especially the cute clothing store! Stylish trends and reasonable prices.

The staff at this hotel had great customer service and always willing to help or answer questions. 

Sadly, the sewer in Vegas was creating issues all over town in hotels so I found out after a smelly hallway. I heard this from more than a few other hotel guests. As hot weather there creates so sewer gas issues. 


I will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and stay again if I ever come back to Vegas.

(We chose our wedding date way before Manny and Floyd.)

From a customer service perspective, they hit it out of the park. From roses in our room to honor our wedding, rate adjustments for a guest who decided to fly in last minute and working out meal adjustments. Every request from ""we need a mini fridge"" to ""can we use 30 wine glasses for our cocktail hour?"" was greeted with a yes. Plus, I'm picky - real picky. 

Food wise, the SBE restaurants on site are fantastic. As an Angeleno, I love Bazaar, umami etc. and found these versions hold up. Cleo Vegas is better than Cleo LA in my opinion.

That said, because the hotel is small - the entertainment engulfs the entire bottom floor. At Caesar's or the Cosmo, you can easily avoid the club traffic. Not here. Diddy and Lil Wayne fans took over the entire lobby and ground floor making it difficult to navigate for anyone there not for them. To be honest, I thought the oldsters in my party would mind but my aunt got a picture with 50 Cent so she was happy. (I have no idea how she knew who he was but God bless her.) Ha. As for me, I couldn't sleep from the bass from Wayne's show going til 3 am (we were high floor, pool view in Lux tower suite). 

We switched to World Tower on our last night and I definitely wouldn't stay in that tower again. Requests took longer to get responded to. Also, a drunk guy wielding a fire extinguisher tried to break into my friend's room at 6 am. But hey, Vegas. 

Lastly, there's a weird perfumey smell permeating the hotel that is not good. I noticed it when we stayed there in March and it's still there now. I learned on a recent biz trip that hotels try corporate scents (weird) so if that's the case - please 86 this one, SLS!!!

Re. Laments about the Sahara demo, I found blood on my pillow case at the Sahara - have we forgotten what that place devolved into? Eep. 

I would stay at the SLSagain but I would check what entertainment is scheduled. If it's a big concert at Foxtail, I probably would go somewhere else that can handle the traffic. Otherwise, cool looks, good food and cheap - just be realistic. It's not SLS Bev Hills but it's not the Rio.",4,8,6

The first time around was nice and I had no issues. Both times I've been here I stayed in the world tower. The rooms are nice and clean and the bed is extremely comfortable.

the hotel. I arrived late Monday evening and requested toiletries around 12:30 in the AM. I assumed being late as it was I would get the toiletries within 10, no more than 15 minutes. 20, 30 and 40 minutes go by and I assumed they just weren't coming at all and I was not going to wait up for anyone. Next thing I know it's 3:30 in the morning and someone is trying to open my door-hard! Luckily I always deadbolt my doors because you never know what could happen. And this made me uneasy because I've never had an employee try to enter my room at this time or without my consent...This is why I'm questioning the service of this hotel! Of course I'm too tired to call the front and complain so the next day during my checkout I express my concern to the concierge who then tells me this is normal. If the guest doesn't answer, they will simply use their own key card and enter the room to leave the items. I've never stayed at a hotel that has ever done this. Also, as he was explaining all this, his tone made me feel like I was silly for bringing it up- Another red flag for me.

The rooms were really nice but not SLS Beverly Hills or SLS Miami nice. The lobby and casino were very modern and clean. The crowd was nice and diverse (the way I like it).

You have to ride the monorail ($12.00 for a 24 hour pass or take a cab ride $15.00 to get to center strip) I am really rooting for the North Strip but it's just dull in the area.

And the bonus - not as lived in as my favorite mid-strip hotels due to the recent renovation. Definitely a plus that there isn't a bazillion people running around the hotel (I am sure to their dismay) but a nice departure from the craziness of Vegas.

I would say one of the only problems I can really see with the property is that they have their own gaming rewards program. When you are competing with the big money in Vegas, it is almost better to not try and beat them but join them. That being said, I didn't see much action going on in the casino at night.

It is definitely further from most hotels on the strip, it didn't bother me because I take taxis everywhere. You can tell they kept the bones of the hotel and tried to give it a new look. The hotel and casino doesn't have the open feel like high ceilings like most casinos do it just felt cramped. 

Now for the rooms.... The restroom is huge but contains no tub and no sink. The sink is located on the outside which looks like where a closet was because there was no closet. Where the beds were it felt cramped but our room had a huge TV. The overall room felt like a bunker but it explains why I got such a good deal.

I signed up for their players club weeks ago only to discover I would have to wait in line for two hours to receive the card. What did registering on line gain me?

Absolutely awesome stay, despite booking a rock bottom room rate on Priceline a few days before my stay.

We were on the 21st floor of the World Tower. Great room. Absolutely silent and no hallway noise during the night. Minimal noise from outside during the day. Free, blazing fast internet. Friendly staff every step of the way. No lineup checking in. A short lineup checking out (but they do have an express checkout too if one so chooses.) Free parking with no shortage of space. Monkey bar in the hotel has very cheap happy hour drinks ($5 for a whiskey sour, that's great by Vegas hotel standards.) Rooms were modern and had great lighting. Elevators were fast, no waiting around for a longtime. The gambling floor didn't even smell too strongly of cigarettes, which is a common problem across most of the city. 

As best I can tell anybody who had a bad experience is out of their frickin' mind. Or is an over-entitled prat.",0,0,0

Received such rude service at the  Center Bar, that I will never return to this casino.  The SLS caters to a young crowd, and we are mid-fifties, so the bartender clearly sized us up as useless old people.  He tried to tell my husband how to insert money into a video poker game - WHAT??!!.  It was the most patronizing behavior, but we ignored it and tried to go on and have a good time.  But that was not to be.  The same bartender soon told us we were not playing poker fast enough or spending enough, and we shouldn't ask for free drinks. Even though I did not even have a drink - just water!  We had enough of the rude treatment, and promptly left.  Used the restroom on the way out, and found vomit on the floor and in the sink.

Review for normal people: Rooms range $50-$200 for a very well designed and appointed room (remember: like ALL hotels, price varies on occupancy). Staff very friendly albeit working out the new hotel kinks. Loft  type design (less is more).  Similar to Morgan's or Standard Hotel product but more ornate\/'artsy'. Restaurants are well done with good variety of cuisine and price points. Try Griddle or Perq for cheap eats. Baazar or Katsuya for for 5-star. We ate in Katsuya...excellent. Drinks in the casino are less than MGM\/Mbay\/Caesar's by a few dollars.  Anyways, its not Four Season or Aman but your not paying $500+++.  Good value. This identical product in L.A. or N.Y. would be $300-$500.

Notes: Valet in front is for casino. Valet in back (off of Paradise rd) for hotel. The tram in back also connects here so you can go to convention center all the way to MGM (24hr pass ~$10). Cab from SLS to MGM is about $15.

First off, it's not really walkable to anywhere, and isn't a destination in and of itself. If you're from LA, you'll recognize a lot of the spots... Sayers Club, Griddle, Katsuya, etc. All nice spots, but... yeah, you're in LV not LA East.

Second, the front desk bungled my reservation in three different ways, wasting an hour or two of time. Not the biggest deal, but didn't set the tone well. Not to mention that if you're staying at the hotel, you should ask your cab to take you to the hotel entrance - not the main entrance, where you have to bring your bags all the way through the poorly marked casino.

Third, it doesn't stand out in any way. The decor is OK but there's something disjointed about it. I'm not a design specialist by any means, but something was off - I just can't but my finger on it.

Other points... The rooms were small, OK, and average. Think, the Standard Hotel, not the SLS Beverly Hills. Cabanas at the pool were nice, great service there - in fact the pool and cabanas were the best parts of our stay there.

Overall, the SLS is mediocre, overpriced, and I'm definitely renewing my allegiance to the Wynn\/Encore - properties in a way different class as far as experience, presentation, and panache which the SLS sorely lacks.

I hope SBE knows that it's doing with the gargantuan expansion because if their other properties are anything like the LV SLS they are going to be in BIG trouble, just a hunch.",3,0,0

I walked slowly through the casino and noticed that they put way too many a lot machines in, forcing people to have to step aside or bump into each other just to get through the casino.

 The ceilings are low and have a warehouse feel. The interior is much like Hard Rock Hotel's renovation but with the unique touch of art like Cosmopolitan, I personally prefer being original. The carpeted floors are very cushioned so ladies please use caution when doing the horse walk. The overall flow is easy to navigate and the interior of each bar and restaurant offers an inviting feel. 

As for the crowd, expect typical Vegas. While this hotel did just open so most employees should be on their A game, I will add that so far each of the people I have interacted with have been very polite. 

It's worth checking out just to say you've been there. I am a local and not staying at the hotel tonight so I can not speak to interior and cleanliness of the rooms. I will update when I do stay with SLS in the future.",3,2,0

I was expecting to many horrible things that I was not looking forward to checking-in. It was a little late to change my reservation because it was booked through Southwest Vacation along with flight, so I prayed for the best...

It's north of the strip, so cab rides there was expensive! And it's far walk to get to the center of the strip, so we had to cab it mostly everywhere... I walked as far as maybe 2 miles and was done, and the weather was nice but a little bipolar but I can't imagine walking in the summer. 

Checked-in fairly fast, it was around 8:30-9PM, and only 1 person helping. I was helped fast but a line began to form and still only one representative. 

Got the keys and complimentary upgrade to higher floor and an extra 50in sq. feet in the room. King bed with non-smoking. The room was modern and strange decor but it was nice!! I love the bed, it was comfy and the infinity mirrors are a nice touch. The TV is huge, lolz. I'm not used to it being that big when I'm on vacation. Everything was nice and up to date. I didn't have any problems other than few stains on the blankets. White is very nice but replace them if it's not longer usable! 

Overall the ambience is for ages like 25-35, it's not busy because there's not many people just traveling to SLS, unless you are staying there. All the restaurants are expensive and it's a bit overpriced for everything. I probably wouldn't stay again without a deal or discount. 

Beware of $150 charge hold on your card for everyday. And late-night in room dining.. Add $18 for delivery and taxes and service fee.. WTH. 

And $28 resort fee, the amenities sucked. Wi-fi sucked..  I don't use the gym and the casino didn't have many tables, it lacked variety..

The staff were pleasant and the decor is very up to date.  The design of the pool area is very modern and compliments the hotel well. There's a nice selection of bars and restaurants through out the hotel providing many different options for the guests. The rooms are very modern and provide an array of lighting options in them.
My issues with the hotel started in the room.  The door to the bathroom slides shut on a rail that has no stopper so when I went to open it I slid the door too far and it fell off of the rail trapping me in the bathroom until my girlfriend had to come and rescue me.  I would have to say that's an extremely poor design on the door, at least have some kind of stopper in place.  The next issue I had were the maids\/cleaning ladies.  While we were away they came in the room to straighten up for us.  The night before I had a small bloody nose that leaked a few spots on our white pillow cases.  The cleaning ladies remade our bed with the same sheets and spotted pillow cases.  The rooms come with a $40 a day food credit that we could use inside of the hotel but that was never told to us and we had to find out through another guest after we had already ate at different restaurants outside of the hotel.  We then had to argue with the guest services representative about removing the charges from food purchases in the hotel.

Pool-given the size of the hotel the pool is TINY.  Something you would expect to find at a boutique hotel in LA that has 50 or so rooms. If you want to spend a weekend day in the pool you'll need to get there super early and claim some territory, but expect to be rubbing elbows with guests in the pool.  HOWEVER, the Fox Tail Pool was a GREAT time. Awesome music,friendly staff, etc. If that's not your bag, than you're out of luck. 

Restaurants-We ate twice at 800 degrees Pizza. Excellent options (GF crust available), moderately priced, good service, and a clean space. Breakfast\/coffee options at Perk were also great, i really liked the ACAI Bowl and fresh coffee (expect LV Strip prices here).  Lastly, the Northside Cafe was awesome.  Great food, and great prices.  4 of us ate brunch here including a Bloody Mary each and it was $100. Not too many places you can find that. 

Hotel Staff-I made 2 phone calls prior to our stay to ensure the two rooms I booked would be connected.  When I was told i couldn't have an adjoining room I asked that they please be next to or across from one another.  I called back days later, just a day before our stay to remind them of this and make sure it was noted on the reservation.  Upon check in, I am assigned the first room and after mentioning my request, the desk personnel had to change the room he was issuing me b\/c it would not accommodate for a nearby 2nd room...the next day, when we checked into the second room we found that room was on the 'same floor' but the complete opposite side. Might as well been on a different floor\/separate tower as we never saw our friends once we went our separate ways to our rooms.  Only once did we see other guests on our floor so I'm not sure how this wasn't possible.  Also, the room we had did in fact have an adjoining room door so I really can't figure out how they couldn't make this happen.  

Housekeeping-on Saturday we left our room by 10 a.m. and returned after 5 p.m. and it was still not clean.  At that point we needed to be in our room to get ready for the evening so we operated with a room which had not been cleaned.  The following day, when I called down for towels I got an unfriendly operator and a half hour wait for some fresh towels.  In addition to this there were napkins scattered down the hallway when we left our room at 8 p.m. Saturday and those same napkins in addition to some other trash, filled the corridor the next morning at 10 a.m. The elevator area had a cigarette butt and ashes and looked untouched for an extended period of time. 

Location-If you're looking to be on the strip and in the thick of it, don't stay here.   They do have a Monorail station which could help defray your taxi expenses or time spent walking and sweating.  

Not to totally bash this place one more thing worth noting was they have a free shuttle to the airport and free parking for those driving so that was nice. However, I don't ever plan on staying here again.  Compared to other hotels I've stayed at on the strip (Mirage, MGM, Aria, Paris) this was by far the worst.",2,0,0

We love the Redbury in Hollywood, and were really looking forward to staying at another hotel in the sbe hotel group.  Honestly, it did not live up to my expectations.
I had booked an inexpensive room on a high floor for our stay (there are always decent deals at this hotel).  When we walked in, it was a cute, modern looking room, but felt a bit claustrophobic.  I realized that was because the only window was behind the bed, so if you were sitting on the bed, it looked like there were no windows.  We were there mid-summer and found the AC was not working.  My husband waited for ""engineering"" to come to our room while I headed out to get a bucket of ice.  Unfortunately, the ONLY ice machine on our floor had been gutted, and there was construction tape around the area.  I returned to find that our AC was not repairable so they were going to move us to another room.  I requested a different floor given the ice machine issue.  They then tried to give us a handicapped-access room which we refused.  Finally, upon our request, we were given a free upgrade to a gorgeous suite, that was decorated in a Baroque theme, had a huge window, sofa, breakfast table and awesome cocktail glasses.  Now, I was liking the hotel.
So, yes, this hotel is on the far end of the strip, but it was no problem at all.  The monorail was literally at the bottom of our elevator.  Also, they have a free shuttle to the airport.

My biggest problem with the hotel is the issue with the pool.  They have a nice, large area called the ""Foxtail Pool"" that they say is a ""pool party"" despite the fact that the DJs where were playing there when we were there were virtually unknown.  They charge for entry even for hotel guests!  When I asked where the hotel pool was, we were sent to a small, unlandscaped, overcrowded rectangle of water that was several floors out of the way.  The bar was small and there was nowhere to sit.  Honestly, the pool in my condo complex at home is way bigger.  Anyway, I could not believe that this is the pool they send their hotel guests to, especially since the non-optional resort fee was supposed to cover pool access.  We had friends staying at the Hilton across the street. Sadly, that pool was much better.
The bars in this hotel are uninteresting, and the casino, is simply not chic or fun.
I loved our room, but only because of the upgrade. It seemed odd that the first room, in a hotel that had only been open a year had a broken AC and ice machine. The only reason to stay at SLS is to save money.",6,1,0

A Bell man broke it down as ""Style, Luxury, and Service"" when our out of town guests inquired about the name...you got your usual restaurant\/casino layout with a few retail spots primarily run by Fred Segal, a cafe, little pool area, nightclub, a lounge, and a little gallery up the escalators which was pretty cool to get a glimpse of.

Again, great restoration effort, and who knows, maybe we'll return to check out one of the restaurants for a bite. Best of luck to you SLS!  ALOHA!!!

The challenge with the sls is that it is located near the stratosphere so you are kinda stuck out there. No real other big casinos nearby. 

The interior decor is nice and I saw some hot women, but the cosmopolitan remains where I go to see the hottest chicks. 

It is worth checking out, but let's just say that I am in no rush to return.",4,3,0

When I finally asked to be transfered to the department that handles the transportation, I was told that No, I am wrong. It is every 30 minutes. Ummm...okay! I'm just repeating what I was told by the front desk. Plus, 45 minutes is longer than 30 minutes so....

Now, the one major downside of this hotel is location. It is literally at the end of the strip and the area can be somewhat scary at night.  However, if you are a group, you are only a few steps away from the Stratosphere tower, which has amazing views of the city.  

In terms of my likes:
-Plenty of restaurants that are pretty decent within the hotel. I had a few conferences but I ate at the SLS Buffet (though I think it was just conference food), Ku Noodle and Northside Cafe.  
-Casino right downstairs
-Gym is a good size
-You can use Hilton Honors points. here.
-Rooms are clean
-Located right on the monorail

Dislikes:
-They put a $150\/night hold on your credit hard. This seems like a lot considering the rates are less than that.  
-Location is not the best

So if you are looking for a cheap hotel, somewhere you can gamble and also eat at 24\/7,  and don't mind taking the monorail to the main part of the strip, it's a pretty decent choice.",3,0,1

I asked for a salad because nothing on the menu is healthy. The girl on the phone was super rude and put me on hold for 10min, I waited because she said she would ask the chef if he could make me a salad. 10min later the manager gets on the phone and said the girl told him I wanted to speak to the manager. I said no sir I just want a salad and the girl told me she would ask the chef. Anyways, the room-service is bad and unhealthy. The hotel is nice looking, but the service so far, from the moment I got off the car service, has been bad. I don't like to leave negative reviews but the lack of healthy options deserves attention.

It was a real mixed bag. So I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at the SLS to an extremely welcoming reception desk. I forget the name of the guy who served us but he was super helpful and very friendly. From there, we went up to our room (in the world tower). The rooms were fab, and set out very well for those in town to party. Great bath products, lots of mirror space for doing your make up, a huge TV and comfy beds (if a little small, bear in mind these twin rooms are definitely only big enough for 2 people, or 4 VERY friendly people). As you'd expect from a new hotel, the rooms were immaculate and were kept clean for the duration of our three night stay. 

I note a lot of the bad reviews mention the hotel location (which is not right in the centre of the strip, it's a little further north). In response, it's really not a problem. This hotel is a) cool enough to hold its own with a great pool, clubs and a decent (if a little smaller than most) casino floor, and b) actually only about a 5 minute taxi ride from Caesars\/Paris etc. That's 10 bucks people, even late night. So no, the location isn't an issue. 

One of my favorite things about this property (I've stayed in Vegas many times now), is the pool. It's medium sized, but I love the stripy ""preppy"" look of the place. The design is cool, and so are most of the people who were staying here. Cool, without being too showy. We met some great people here. As a bonus, you get to look up from the pool at people throwing themselves off the Stratosphere* as you sip on a cold beer. Not something you see every day! 

I will write reviews in due course for the specific clubs and restaurants we went to within the property. However, in a nutshell, I would totally stay at the SLS again, and would recommend it to friends.

1. Room service is terrible, mark my word, they did not change anything in the room for 3 straight days. Not even the soap in the rest room. I didn't had soap to take bath the next day and they never bothered to put a new one.

3. Please see the pictures I uploaded, the blanket itself is in pretty bad condition. UNBELIEVABLE.

off the strip but with the monorail being right there it doesn't make a difference.  

Every employee was super friendly and welcoming to us.  There are a few restaurants and bars on site as well as a casino. There is also an amazing nightclub called Life.  It is off the hook but drinks will cost you an arm and a leg so I would drink before going in.  They are about 15$ a piece.  My favorite part about the club was it actually played great music.  Not that techno crap but hip hop that I could dance to!

We are at Unami burger inside and it was so delicious! I don't recommend their drinks though, they were super expensive and weak.  Burgers were great though.

Food options in the hotel mirror what you can find in LA. There's 800 Degrees pizza (quick, made to order pizza for around $10), Katsuya, Umami Burger, and a buffet. The It also has a small gambling floor and beautiful pool area.

Overall, our experience was good. I enjoyed the modern deco of the building and it's new features. However, it is at the very end of the strip (across the street from Circus Circus), which means the main attractions are not in walking distance.

Initially I was impressed by the hotel's overall chic and contemporary​ design. Although a bit undersized, I find the rooms charming and stylish. The yellow accent (I requested for the story tower) was a stand out. The htl has good choices of restaurants and we particularly loved the food at the Northside Cafe.  Not long after, my amusement was cut short.  I was going to shower but noticed there wasn't any shower cap, so I called guest services and requested.  20 mins passed and no shower cap came, called again to follow up, waited another 15 mins and still nothing.  After 4 calls and more than an hour wait later, I decided to make an improvised cap and proceeded to take a shower as I was getting really tired and sleepy.  That was when it finally came...  And as if that frustration wasn't enough, the sliding door to the shower was derailed while trying to close it (and I thought I was in an upscale htl). So I had to call guest services again to report as I was so scared it wld fall on us while sleeping. The handyman came and confirmed that we may need to be relocated to another room bec he needed more time to repair it.  All these happened late at night when the last thing we wanted after a long and exhausting day was to watch a sliding door being repaired.  And all throughout these shambles, not a single apology was offered.  This hotel's customer service is terribly awful!  I have stayed in several huge and premier hotels and I'm an elite member of some htl groups including SPG, to which SLS is a member but never had this kind of mediocre treatment before.  I understand how things can get out of control  occasionally which is not unusual and has happened to us a few times.

Shortly after we got back home, I sent a message to the hotel  about these incidents but they never bothered to reply.  Tsk...Tsk...

It took me 30 minutes just to check in, the front desk was fully staffed, but kept having tech issues as I kept hearing them say.  Nonetheless I was patient and this was not a deal breaker.  
The experience got worse after I checked in and then I had to wait in line another 20 minutes at the World Tower Elevator bank.  For some reason the elevators stop on multiple floors without being called, I don't understand what the problem is, but clearly there are some kinks here to be worked out.  This elevator issue continued throughout the stay here and sadly became the joke of every elevator ride as other hotel guests were experiencing the same issue.  After almost of hour of waiting after arriving at the hotel, I get to the room, where I was impressed.  The bed looked a little undersized (Not a King Size as booked), but no big deal.

Since it's a new hotel I thought I'll check it out but I was not impressed. The room size was decent but the decor was so odd with pink and black paint on the wall. The wall was screaming at me. I've been to Vegas way too many times meaning I have stayed at almost all the hotels on the Strip. With that being said, SLS Vegas unfortunately did not make it even close to my top 10 hotels. 

The service here is poor. I have reservation but I checked in early around 10am during Memorial's Day weekend meaning there was no available room yet which I understand considering check-in time is at 3pm. The Rep at the registration desk said there will be a room with a double bed available for me before 3pm and I will be notified once room is available. Around 1pm, I was notified that my room was available and to my surprise when I opened the door to my room there was only one bed. I was not pleased so I went down to complain and spoke to Maurell who said she was the Lead Front Desk Rep. She was unpleasant, stating she does not know why the previous Rep would promise me a double-bed room when there was no such availability and that there is nothing she can do for me besides waiving the resort fee which was $28\/day. I asked if she can just request a roll-in bed for my room and her response was, ""No, ma'am you can only have the resort fee waived or the bed and not both."" The issue with the resort fee is that it includes access to the fitness center, valet parking and wifi but I also addressed the issue to Maurell on how the wifi for my room was not working meaning we shouldn't even be charged for the resort fee to begin with. Her response, ""But ma'am the resort fee also includes valet and fitness center"". Seriously, the point I'm trying to make here is that my wifi is not working and I don't care for the fitness center or the valet parking. I wouldn't be on here writing this bad review if she would have just given me a roll-in bed. Let's make matters worse, when I checked out the resort fee was not even waived and no roll-in bed.

We have reserved a property about 3 hrs out of Vegas and didn't want to make that drive as soon as we landed.  So we decided to just book a fairly cheap hotel room for the one night and then drive out to Utah the next morning.

We booked SLS via a discount website, so for the price we paid for, I think it's A-OK.  But if I had to pay more, I think I'd not be so ""Ok"" with it.  First off, it's an old building renovated to give it a fresher new look.  Nice effort, but not quite there to try and sell it as a four star hotel.  The room we got was sooooo small.  To save space, there is a single sliding door that opens up the bathroom.  When the door closes, it reveals the sink.  So you really need to communicate when you are coming out of the bathroom so you don't accidentally take out your significant other or room mate.  Otherwise, the decor is not so bad.

The casino is small'ish when compared to other big name casino's on the strip.  But still not bad and has all the necessary stuff.  The cafe downstairs to get coffee and baked goods is pretty good and decently priced.  We actually got a cup of coffee and some desserts there after a late dinner and sat there to people watch... no joke, that was VERY entertaining....",1,2,0

The new ownership and management has made necessary cosmetic repairs to make this place 4 stars.

I want to mention the pools are wonderful. 

I especially enjoyed the Lux Pool.

It's more intimate and less crowded than Foxtail.

There are many lounge chairs and umbrellas.

The staff are friendly and very accommodating.

The room I stayed in was huge over 600sf. 

I loved the dual shower heads and the view of the North Strip.

The TV was huge and the bed was so comfy.

The additional sofa was cool but wasn't very comfortable. It had cushions attached by hooks - reminded me of patio furniture. 

I love the small table which was perfect for room service or for adding items that you didn't want on the desk.

The continued issue with elevators out of service was still present. The east garage was down the entire trip... 

I'll be back again for sure though as I've fallen in love with the property. 

The ease of getting in and out of the resort is a perk compared to the newer mega resorts where you feel like you walk over a mile to get to your car.

being a guest here at SLS from point A to point B was tremendous and such an easy glaze.

Pulling up to valet was our first encounter and the gentlemen who helped us out was already super polite asked us where we were coming from and how our day was going so far. Walking into the building and the ambiance was so cool, I liked the randomness or it. They had like real modern pieces to the hotel and nice looking cafes and bars surrounding the check in lobby. The woman whom helped us out at the front desk, think her names was Karina? well she was a nice outgoing lady. She noticed my boyf was wearing a Pacman shirt and asked us how we felt about his recent fight against Jesse Vargas BUT upgraded us for free from the basic room we got to one of their tower rooms which I believe she mentioned was going to soon be the ""W""

Our floor had funky monkeys on the window center near the elevators. and OMG! entering our room was soooooooo sick. White everything with modern couches a big mirror to make the room look or feel like a bigger space.  A sex mirror on top of the celiing, a marvelous bathroom with a weighiong scale, bigger sized toiletrees to last for 2 people. It was just awesome.

This hotel is far away from the overbuilt part of the Vegas strip where you'll find your typical Vegas hotels like Wynn, Venetian, Ceasar's, Cosmopolitan etc. It's secluded and it's also more of a boutique hotel. However, if you feel like visiting the other hotels there is a monorail station built in the backlot of the SLS. You can buy an all day access pass for only $12. But I'm warning you. Once you step foot on the more populated area of the LV strip you'll notice a drop in class. You'll want to head right back to your safe haven.

Now, about the hotel. I noticed that the service was excellent. Everyone who works at the SLS must have gone through quality training. The staff was polite and friendly. For once I didn't feel like a walking dollar sign. 
The casino is pretty small but I liked it. The restaurants range from casual breakfast, lunch to formal dining. I went to Katsuya, Cleo, Umami Burger, and The Griddle. I highly recommend the first two for dinner. Also the rooms are modern and sleek. I stayed in the world superior King room. It has two giant mirrors with built in lighting which are across each other on opposite sides of the wall, a king bed, and a decent sized bathroom. The bed is really comfortable btw.

I also had time to go to the gym. It's a small gym but it has everything you need for a decent workout. No squat racks or bench press but there are free weights.

The foxtail pool is modern and sleek as well. The servers were very attentive and friendly. 

To sum it up. If you've had enough of the overcrowded, trashy, rude, crappy service Las Vegas experience and you're looking for something classier then I recommend the SLS. If you want to spend your money in a BIG hotel with BAD attitude then stay somewhere on the populated section of the strip.",7,1,2

Bottom line it's an OK, if slightly isolated and slow place. I usually visit a place 2 times before writing a review, but considering what I want in Vegas, and the selection of rooms, I just don't see going back to the SLS.

Rooms: I really dig the history, being the old Sahara casino, and you can still feel it in both good (history, lore, and things peeking through) and bad ways (small rooms and things peeking through in a negative way). The rooms are cool, but as every other review has mentioned they are small. The good news is they are now offering tons of specials and getting one cheap is easy. That may ruin the image for some though? 

Nightlife: I heard they were busy on opening weekend which is to be expected, so perhaps it was more fun then. When I was there it was slow, very slow. In another town or even a busier section of Vegas that's OK, but this place is isolated from the real action on the south end of the strip. It leaves you no where to go, to look for a happening venue. Yeah you can hop the monorail but why when you can stay at the sound end and easily walk from club to club? 

Food: They are trying for an exclusive L.A. vibe but when its slow that's very hard to pull off (compounded by the entry level neighbors like Circus Circus). Also the whole L.A. thing is getting old. Bazaar Meat was very good, Katsuya was good but Umami is now just another chain. Maybe I am getting snobby but many SBE restaurants are starting to feel very corporate and like chains versus gastronomic expeditions. I am not a buffet person but they are already closing the buffet and it will ""reopen in 2015"". 

Takeaway: I can only imagine planning the SLS seemed like a much better idea when the debacle that is the Fontainebleau seemed like it was going to be amazing and other higher end neighbors would move in.  Now the Fontainebleau is a $3 billion, never occupied, soon to be demolished failure. I honestly feel bad for the SLS as it leaves them so isolated. They are stuck with neighbors like Circus Circus. I am sure they didn't expect to be the only nice place on the block. This place would have made a lot more sense with 2-3 high end neighbors. 

Casino: Small, as others have said, but I sort of liked it. It felt far less tacky which I really appreciated. You could feel some of the history, in a good way here. The dealers were friendly as well and the staff kept the drinks flowing. It was one of the high points of my stay. 

Various other things: The elevator situation is insane, nothing else to say many people here have covered it. The staff is a mixture of apathetic while also trying to maintain a ""too hip for you"" L.A. vibe. That doesn't fly too well when the place is decidedly not ""hot"" yet. You can get snobby when the reviews start getting better and the place becomes a must stay destination. It is VERY FAR from that as is.

If the SLS were on the south end it would be a viable option to put in my rotation. Especially now that they are offering rooms under $100 a night. When I left I found myself wondering about the future of this place though. They had some layoffs last month, they got a new president who was president of the failed Revel Casino in Atlantic City, and now they are closing the buffet.",3,0,0

On top of it, they have this ridiculous black and white huge poster above your bed of people at a concert. Not anyone you would want to look at by the way. We called down and have the front desk change our room to another room with the larger bed. He put us in a different Tower. The new room is even worse than the old room. The bathroom is separated from the shower and toilet by a tiny metal sink . The toilet and shower here is worse than any Tijuana hotel. The so-called bathroom is a joke. There is no bathroom.

Everyone I encountered was pretty nice.
Check in had a long line but it moved pretty quickly. I stayed in a King room in the World Tower, the elevators lobby needs to be redone for sure. All mirrors made waiting for the elevators a bad experience. With people coming from the monorail from the other side it was very congested and busy. Made me nauseous.
The room for me was decent size but that is not something I really care much about since I just need a bed and a shower. The bed was comfortable and the shower head was amazing.

I was on cloud nine, and if it wasn't for Dani who allowed us to go back into the club, my phone  and belongings would of been a goner for good! So DANI JACKSON thank you SOOOOOOO much for all of your help and the help of the security day staff for helping me make this Vegas trip a very memorable one!! I will definitely stay there again and refer all of my friends and family to this hotel as well!!! The SLS ROCKSSSS!!! Esp DANI JACKSON!!!! :)",1,1,0

Lighted wall mirrors on each side of the room, comfortable queen size bed, clean bathroom with shower only and the wifi is free with as many devices you want (as opposed to other resorts which is a 1 device minimum.)

The property itself is not impressive and probably more along a 2.3 star compared to all the other options on the strip.

Very modern upbeat and techy. The rooms were fully stocked, and up to date. Staff, Security, and services were on point from the parking structure to club. No Nonsense out of control youngsters.

The rooms are modern and chic, with glowing lights trimming and accenting the room ever so delicately throughout.

Things I absolutely loved:
1. The staff was all super friendly, even the custodial staff
2. The casino was kept super clean and I never smelled cigarette smoke unless someone was smoking right beside me
3. The rooms were amazing!  Super comfy beds, unique decorations, 2 huge light up mirrors, a clean and modern bathroom with a great assortment of toiletries including a sewing kit and a kit containing q-tips and cotton pads.
4.  I asked the cleaning lady to refill the toiletries I used and she left me 2 of each
5.  The prices in their coffee shop were very reasonable.  They charged less than the Starbucks back home
6.  They have a monorail stop and I love the monorail! 

Things that need to be improved upon so they can get 5 stars:
1.  The check in desk isn't marked and I nearly walked past it.  I had to ask the girl behind the counter if it was where I checked in- I'm sure she's asked so often she's sick of it!
2.  The bed is directly under the window.  This led to my head being super cold at night even with the heater blaring.  Closing the blinds and pulling down the blackout shade helped a little but it was still pretty cold.  
3.  The internet is super unreliable.  I had to constantly reconnect it and the signal was constantly lost.
4. The bellhop had a desk in the morning when I dropped my bag off to be stored.  Upon return the desk was gone and I was sent ""Out the door and to the right"" and ended up at the valet desk.  I was expecting a desk but the bellhop was just a man standing near the cab area with his back to the hotel.

It's a boutique, not a monstrosity.  Just what I want from a Vegas hotel.  What doesn't it have?  A great casino, and a little far down the strip so you are forced to drive, taxi, or monorail out.

#1 - Get here while it's affordable.  Whether you use Travelocity.com (like I did), hotels.com, or book direct -- there is amazing deals to be had right now.  On average, $139\/night.  Again, amazing.

#2 - Restaurants.  Whether you dine at Cleo, Bazaar Meat, Katsuya, or casual dining spots like the SLS Buffet, Griddle Café, 800 Degrees, Umami -- all are beyond great experiences.  Less so: Perq the coffee spot (it's okay), and Ku Noodle (very casual, has shu mai but not potstickers).

#3 - Service.  Wonderful and friendly, it was warm and extra nice for the moment I arrived.  Kudos.

#4 - Pool.  Cabanas are pricey, so I was able to get a soft and cushiony bed just inside the pool.  Cool music with outstanding looking pool hostesses and bartenders created a relaxing vibe that was also titillating.

We checked in on a Monday night. We believed that hotel registration was across from the monkey bar, but without signage we couldn't be too sure. The desks were dimly lit and only one person was behind the desk assisting a guest. It could have easily been mistaken for concierge. We waited our turn and confirmed it was indeed hotel check in. We were able to secure a King room in the Lux tower, which is a bit larger and comes with extra conveniences (robes, in room dining, spa access) compared to the other two towers. 

The room key is needed to access the elevator whether you're headed up or down. The floor numbering is a bit confusing too. Our room was 208XX. Any guesses which floor that was on? Eight, would be correct. The room was clean, a bit quaint and quirky, and even a bit creepy. The bathroom, however, was nicely done. The only complaint there was that the sink was so shallow it was difficult for my husband to fit his hands under the faucet while washing his hands. Toiletries are large sizes. Too large really, but it's nice to have so much available. 

The room was awkward the bed seemed smaller than your average king. The placement of the TV was peculiar given the vantage points. The dining area would only comfortable fit two around the table, but there was seating for two or three more. The fabric on the walls was quirky and made the walls seem smaller. The lady above the bed was creepy, and the mirror above the bed increased the creepy factor. The bed appeared more plush than it was, it was actually quite firm. The pillows all seem like decorative accessories since they are all covered in shams. There was no sheet between the one that covers the bed and the comforter. I really dislike this. I was cold or sweltering all night. Not too mention is old legend that hotels don't change the comforter between every guest stay. I certainly hope that's not the case here. 

I wanted to love it more than I did, but the style just doesn't appeal to me. Our experience in the casino didn't impress us either. Staff (aside from the check in clerk) was really cold, and some where unprofessional. The carpet around the table games was littered in trash and cocktail waitresses don't seem to cover much of the casino floor. They seem to only work the pit and the slot area near Umami Burger. We were given three 2-for-1 cocktail coupons, but the lounges where they were valid were closed. Various bars are supposed to have local specials on cocktails until 8pm, but we didn't find one that honored it. The only special was 2 Bud Lights for $5 at Umami. I'd much rather pay full price for a good beer. Overall, the staff outnumbered the guests by 3:1 at least. You'd expect top notch service at that ratio.

Yes, I agree, some of decor does not make sense they have a Monkey Bar near the hotel check-in and other pictures of monkeys, so it's monkey theme, you think, and you are wrong.  But you get nice service from the staff. You get to your room and you realized that it's pretty clean and elegant.  Then later you decide to play the slots and have dinner there before going out for drinks with friends, and you realize wtf, why are people complaining??   The food and drinks are good.  The place is clean and elegant.  I am sorry, but I have stayed at the Venician and Cesar's, and last time at the Flamingo, which is not that super nice; however, all in all I think the SLS for the price is worth it.

The casino was filled with tons of sexy eye candy, which is a rarity in Vegas that typically houses a more Walmart friendly kind of clientele.

I pigged out at all of them and they were everything I wanted them to be.

My friend and I went to Vegas for her birthday and after looking at tons of reviews (really, the pictures ) on trip advisor we chose SLS for the price and amenities. 

PROS: 
1. Ambiance (modern, eclectic, sexy, clean and tidy)
2. Friendly Staff (front desk, cleaning crew) 
3. Nice pool (good dj, nice bartenders) 
4. A lot of +'s in the room (very clean and tidy, comfy bed, story tower room with double beds adequate for two friends, eclectic and modern feel with cool features like lighted headboard and mirror on the ceiling) 
5. Casino (small but newer games than some of the other hotels on the strip - plus my friend and I won a few bucks!) 
6. Restaurant options (high end and low end available, overall good food at good prices) 

CONS: 
1. Smoke (pretty much a con for me everywhere in Vegas! But I hated the smoking in the casino)
1.2 (because 1 is not really a reasonable con for Vegas since they smoke EVERYWHERE!) Room layout (bathroom area layout in story tower double room is wonky. I'm sure it was a space saver, but the sliding mirrored door that slides over the vanity \/ sink area is an awful idea. My friend nearly knocked me to the ground twice while I was putting on make up!) 
2. Location (it's FAR from the ""action"", you have to take an uber to get to the other end of the strip, but if you are looking to actually stay in a hotel that's not in a super busy area this is the place for you) 
3. Mini Bar (my biggest complaint. The mini bar....my friend took a drink out just to look at it and put it back after about 30 seconds and thank the Lord she did. Unbeknownst to us, there was a small sign that said if you remove a beverage for over 60 seconds you will be charged so Beware!)",0,0,0

We never once heard our neighbors and were very impressed with the restaurants and quick room service call. The hotel is definitely north of most of the action (better than Stratosphere), so I would recommend getting a monorail pass. It's not as busy as other hotels, which is likely why we loved it so much! You weren't running into people every step you took and the staff really took time to assist in your needs. We found a great rate on a Groupon, but they recently became part of the Starwood Alliance which will guarantee lowest rates anyways.

We booked 4 nights, they wanted an additional 600$ for the incidental deposit. After about 30 minutes of arguing, we got them down to 300$. No offense, but this isn't the Cosmo or Bellagio. 
WIFI SUCKS!! 


We arrived at 9am, so them allowing us to check in so early was awesome. The rooms are very different. We stayed in the world tower. Two HUGE mirrors on each side of the room that light up. The 360 sq ft room feels a lot bigger. The bed is soooo comfortable. The pillows are also available to purchase, which im going to do once we leave. (Still here) the bathrooms have horrible lighting (for girls who love makeup) but in the room, the mirrors I mentioned are the BEST lighting I've come across in any hotel for makeup. 

We paid 69$ per night. Total of 430. Including resort fees and all that nonsense. 69$ for this room is WELL WORTH the the $.  You seriously need to put up a fight about the incidental charge. That's ridiculously high, (bf is from here, I lived here 3 years previously) most hotels now accept CASH 100$ and that's it. This was supposed to be 600$ on card and TWO WEEKS to return it to you. The guy next to us was also pissed. It's probably why the lines take so long while checking in, people FLIP once they are told this. We told them we would just leave is they wouldn't lower it. Not to brag (seriously) but 600$ for us Isnt a big deal it was the principle. We specifically use a pre paid debit card for hotel deposits so they can't charge us more sneakily. We only loaded 100$ onto the card. We really would have left if they said no to 100$ on card and rest cash. They ended up just wanting 300$ cash, makes no sense but whatever. 300$ is more acceptable.

Overall the location is not great but it's fairly solid. 

The hotel itself just opened end of 2014 is therefore pretty new. Everything is really fashionable and cool which gives is a great vibe. The rooms are really fancy with loads of mirrors including a mirror directly over your bed. The TV on the wall is also state of the start and really huge. 

Beds are very comfortable and big enough for two people. Room size in general is not huge but big enough considering that you anyways won't spend most of the day there. 

The pool area is nice too and normally not too crowded. Additionally there is free self parking and elevators take you directly into the hotel and casino.

The furnishings and decor are more eclectic and modern than the other casinos, which are more gaudy and overdone. The design is clean and not fancy. It has a functional feel. I was here for a concert at the Foxfire pool area. The nice touch of the pool was the couches and cabanas that were available. It gave a feel of o living room with a pool. The pool bar as well stocked. Prices were higher than some of the other hotels in the strip. Call drinks $ 12 each. Beer at $ 8.  But, that's the Vegas strip. The venue being closer to Freemont street in the older part of the casino strip one round image the drink prices to be less than the lower strip. Not so.

The robes are insanely comfortable, I didn't want to change into clothes. I would have played slots in that robe if I could have. 

The hotel itself has a boutique feel and by contrast to places like Planet Hollywood and The Cosmopolitan. It stands out because it's scope is smaller and not focusing as hard on the gambling aspect as identifying itself as a resort. The stores are refined, the pool area lovely.

The service was friendly and professional and I thought there list of restaurants was impressive (though being from LA not new because a lot of their food options originated in LA).
 
It sits between DTLV and the Strip and if you like to visit both and have to stay in one or the other the location is ideal.

Our family flew into Las Vegas after a week in Disneyworld.  We usually don't bring our kids to Vegas, but my hubby and I were running the RnR Las Vegas Half Marathon on Sunday the 13th.  My parents were driving up to Las Vegas to pick us up there and to watch our kids.  

Anways, upon check-in we were told that because we had our kids we would be ""upgraded"" to the Deluxe tower because the other tower is a roughty one and because we had the kids, it would be better.  We thought that was a great idea and we didn't have a problem with it.  

Upon entering our room, my kids were excited!  The room is definitely much bigger than the King size bed room we get at the other tower.  What we noticed immediately was the overwhelming smell of weed.  I'm sure it would be great it we smoked cigs or even weed, but we don't smoke.  Our kids soon discovered the smell and they wanted to know what it was and why it smelled so bad.  We called the front office to ask what the problem was.  Marissa advised that at times some of the smoke from the vents can leak into another room and that she would send security to the upper floor to do a sweep.  She said we were on a non-smoking room and floor, BUT we were right above the smoking floor.  She said she would give us a call if another room became available in case we wanted to move - which we did.  As we stepped out of our room we stopped by the front desk because we had not heard from Marissa and we spoke to Karla.  She went back to look for Marissa, but Marissa apparently was not at her desk at that time.  So off we went to have lunch and still no call on our cell phone from anyone.  We checked back upon returning to our room and Harlo told us that Marissa had attempted to call us.  Okay?  So if she attempted to call us, where is the voicemail?  We didn't have one!  So, Harlo proceeds to tell us that they were still waiting to move us and they had one room available, but they were waiting for that guest to check out.  Alrighty!  Cool...fabulous!  We told him we were going up to our room and staying there so that they should call the room to contact us and I double checked my husband's cell # (again) to make sure they had the correct # on file.  The night passes us by and we get ZERO from anyone!  Sunday morning, congested as hell I call the front desk to ask what the hell is going on.  I had the pleasure of speaking to Daniel, who said they were still waiting!  Really??  I checked in Friday and it's now Sunday and although someone said they would call back (and haven't), it's now Sunday and you're still waiting?  I finally lost my $hit and told him it was a bunch of BS that after speaking to Marissa, Karla, Harlo...nothing was done.  He said he was the manager (with his snippy little attitude) and told me that alllllllllllllllllll of the sudden there was a room available, but it only has 1 king size bed!  Ughh!  The death of me!  My husband was fed up and said for those ppl to take a flying leap!  We stayed in our room and made our kids spend the night at my parent's hotel.  We had one light left, we'd deal w\/ the BS and leave first thing in the morning.

We have stayed at SLS for years!  Since it opened actually and we have never received as sorry of a response as we did this visit!  The lack of communication is a joke!  If you don't have a room tell us the truth, if you don't want to move us, tell us that, but don't give us some run around story about what you can do and never come through with your false promises.

Our family does not smoke and we choose to not be around it.  It's a choice of ours.  If my husband and I were alone, maybe we'd deal with it and survive, but when we have our kids with us - that is when it becomes an issue.  So you know, after 3 crappy nights of sniffing smoke I had to visit the doctor because I could not get rid of a stupid cough.  Turns out my nose was irritated, which worsened my allergies, which gave me a crappy dry cough for 1 week.  All because of this!  Yes, I'm not dead...yes...I'll live, but if I'm paying to stay in a NON-SMOKING floor or room.  I would really like to receive that.",2,3,0

The W hotel has now taken over this hotel chain (Marriott\/Ritz-Carlton\/SPG - Starwood Preferred Guests).

We stayed on the Sophia Loren floor.

Bedroom: (World Tower) - 17th floor
*1st thing...do not even try to tip the desk\/check-in staff. The $20 trick (found on YouTube) does not work.

You'll get what they give you.

Our 2 bed ($99\/per night for 2 nights with a $100 drink credit) was an ok deal. I'd seen on other sites the $85\/per night deal.

The beds were AWESOME! Soft, not too firm.  The room was the same size as the rooms at The D hotel.  

Amenities: 
No microwave at any of the hotels
No mini fridge
No coffee maker (room service hot water $5)

Towel service:
You will be given ...
(1) face towel
(2) hand towels
(3) body towels
(1) floor towel
* you have to ask for a bath mat and extra towels

**if there are 2 separate people in the room, not a couple...you'll  have to ask for extra shampoo, soap, and conditioner.

Because their is a casino attached you do receive 2 bottles of complimentary water in the room.  You can ask anywhere in the hotel for free bottles of water.

The room comes equipped with in-room mini liquor cooler and Saint &Sinner snacks (very expensive).  I advise EVERYONE just walk around the corner (cross the street) and a massive\/very CLEAN Walgreens is right there. And a McDonalds...in the mini strip mall...REALLY it is only steps away, like walking to your mailbox.

Don't be a fool and take from the minibar!!  You'll pay heavily. Walk around the corner.

*Complimentary Conference Shuttle (@this location)

Mirrors: 
The room has these over sized mirrors. To turn on\/off look for the button inbedded into the front of mirror).

Pool:
During our visit the pool was open 9am til 8pm.  

No more pool parties!
Food service closes at 6:30pm
Drink service ends 6pm

It looks like the entire pool area is getting ready to undergo a major overhaul. The cabana seats and couches are worn and ripped. The bar seats are falling apart (gosh, I should have taken pictures to prove what I'm saying).

Limited shade places. Arrive early to get a spot. Otherwise be forewarned the sun will welcome you along with skin Cancer!!

Near the 4 oversized outdoor mirrors (in a far away corner) you will find hidden a narrow lap pool (for 1). I was told it's a hot tub but others tell me it was not warm and is only a lap pool. I can't see this as a lap pool..it's too tiny.

The pool is NOT heated.  The pool goes to 4' deep only with shelf seating.

Concierge:
Their was always at least 1 Concierge on duty to help make arrangements for trips, plays, shows, restaurants, etc.

Monkey Bar - 
The small bar in the hotel.

W hotel - 
Attached ...but at the time a sign was up ""Private Party only"".  I could only see a huge bar from where the sign and employee was staffed to keep folks at bay.

The Perq - 
A small coffee shop that serves pastries, desserts, sandwiches and adult coffee drinks\/smoothies.

Casino - 
A nicely kept, clean gaming area.  I was told doesn't really pay back very well.

Her boutique - 
Friendly very helpful, outgoing and knowledgeable staff.  They carry the most up to date fashions, hats, purses, etc.  Good sales.

I saw several restaurants and the nightclub but since I was out at a conference during the day and with family at night I cannot review those places fairly except to say...this establishment is CLEAN!!

Do not bring food back which needs to be kept or heated. You'll be wasting your money.  Use the ice buckets to chill your drinks.

Valet - 
Confusing. Their are 2 sides to this hotel.  To park your vehicle with Valet go to the back side on Paradise Road (or shoot straight through the ""DO NOT ENTER""\/""Diplomat Exotic Rentals"" way from 
S. Las Vegas Blvd...which will bring you to the valet.

Crazy I realize .... but that is the more direct route.

Drop-off\/Pick-up:
S. Las Vegas Blvd.

(BONUS)
Staff is ALWAYS around for 24 hour help and security!

Hope all of this helps someone!!

The casino was packed, everyone testing their luck, my wife included.  We signed up for ""the code"", SLS's players card club.  My wife said she got $5 in free play, used it and turned it into $20.  Yes!  Free burger at Umami!

The layout is wide open, walkways along the borders of the casino and a pathway through the middle of the casino.  When you enter through the front entrance you have this cool cosmopolitan type vibe about the place with mirrors on the ceiling, and walls, and a floor that lights up.    However if you go further in, the ceiling is open and you see all the pipes, and building frame.  I'm not sure if this is the plan, or they just decided to open their casino ahead of finishing the ceiling.  It doesn't really look nice to look up though.   It does not match the 'sexy' 'cool' outer appearance the casino gives outside especially at night.    I also noticed the floor immediately outside the casino, and the carpet were pretty dirty.  This will be tidied up eventually, I'm sure.

All-in-all, the hotel was probably rushed to open before the holiday weekend next week, but it has plenty of potential with a plethora of restaurants, multiiple nightclubs, and ample space in the casino floor w\/ a variety of options for gambling.  Good luck, SLS!",7,2,4

This hotel is at the north end of the strip. However, the monorail makes it so easy to get to all the other hotels in the strip. 

When I checked in they first told me my reservation was cancelled. I payed for the night before to ensure that when I arrived at 7am my room would be ready. I must say they rectified that issue quickly. They reinstated my room and upgraded my room. They then realized it was my birthday and the from desk clerk took it upon herself to comp our breakfast. She was very friendly she asked questions. She smiles had a genuine conversation with us. 

The rooms were very clean and had no problems. I called down for more towels. Went out and when I got back they were right there in my room. The girls who cleaned our room did a wonderful job. 

We ate at several restaurants during our stay. The one negative I would have is the staff at north side. None of the wait staff smiled. Even one of the managers had a face that made you not want to ask a question. All others restaurants I had great service. Bazaar Meats was epic. 

I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to family and friends.

What a difference a Starwood takeover makes.  The SLS is a modern hotel and casino, slightly off the main part of the strip (which I found delightful) and is well appointed, and not overrun with too many non-guests (or it seems) like the Venetian or the Bellagio.

From the moment I arrived, check in was a breeze, and even though I arrived early, I was accommodated with an early check in and was in my room in less than 5 minutes.  I love that the hotel has security staff at the entry point to the elevators to each tower, only allowing hotel guests to pass.  This measure of security matters to a woman who frequently travels alone for business.  The hotel was decorated in a very fun, modern (Apple-esque) decor.  The elevators were each very bold and colorful, and each floor, when the elevator opened, showcased a different musician or artist.  A cool touch.

My room - Very cool.  I think a standard room, but very spacious (the mirrored walls help to add the feeling of space) and well laid out.  Modern furnishings, and comfortable bed and linens.  The bath amenities were the biggest surprise!  HUGE bottles of all the regular items (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, body wash)  All 3.4 oz, instead of the tiny bottles you usually see.  They actually last a three day visit.  And, were quite pleasing. Minibar had many interesting selections, but pretty pricey.  LOVED the TV, and the tech involved.  Easy to navigate from tv, in-room dining, and other selections.

Very cool place.  Check out the pool, although if you want a drink, go to the bar, getting seated service is really tough.",0,0,0

He hands me my ticket and I lug my own suitcase out of the trunk. Clearly I was checking in by the sight of my large luggage. No one mentioned to me that there was a second valet only steps from hotel registration. I haul my things across the casino. Super bummed at how dirty my room was. I didn't realize it until my last day as I was enjoying the city. Filthy room. Dust mites lining the walls all over. A used, dirty Qtip next to the bed and drops of dried liquid on the base of the toilet. Super unfortunate for a W hotel.

This management coming from Reno is also the most racist that I seen and experienced and I came from Texas. If you are Black just avoid this casino it's no good the slots is loose enough so they can sucker you back with all your hard earned money. I won their week drawing with 39,000+ entries but couldn't hear being in Northside Cafe. Yesterday I talk to someone in Code Players Club they told me I had free slot play throughout the month of June. Today they denied I have any free slot play.

The staff are not very friendly, everyone from the valet guy, the front desk lady, and the host that we talked to at one of their restaurants were so ""I hate my job"" kind of personality\/monotone. We're paying a good amount of money to stay at this hotel they could at least give a smile to their hotel desk. 

As far as sucky customer service, the presentation\/decor of the hotel is nice. I like the hip ""LA, minimalist-chic"" feel to the hotel, I give that one star. 

The hotel was only renovated to look more modern, but you can tell the elevators aren't new, I saw two broken elevators. 

The walls are thin so you can hear every word of your neighbors conversations. I think that's due to the old building.

Going back to the decor of the hotel, the rooms are cute too, good ""selfie"" lighting, and there's two full sized mirrors in the room which make it nice. This is where my 2nd star comes from. 

Other than that, that's all that I thought was nice. The casino is tiny, and it doesn't have a ""vegas"" feel to it.

For the price you're better off getting a room at cosmopolitan who has better customer service and just as cool decor. (And WAY BETTER FOOD, but that's a whole other story)

-The lighted reflective mirrors is a great technique to lighting up the room. 

-The Tv size is decent. 

-Bathrooms are clean. 

-Shower pressure is fairly weak. I personally like it alittle stronger. Toilet pressure is nice and strong however. Faucet is fine. I like the extra ledge for toiletry. I'd say the bathroom is a fair size. 

-It's a boutique hotel so the rooms are small compared to others on the strip. (Ie Trump, Wynn, Encore, Bellegio, Venitian) 

-Not much space for cloths

-the ac\/heater blows pretty strong air for such a small space. Some people like this, others, not so much. 

-this is a chic hotel geared for younger crowds. Personally, I don't care for the black and white color scheme. The lights are also dimmed at the reception area. 

-the linens are soft and all white so any stains are easily identified. 

-self parking has 2 entrances. You want the second one (when entering the parking garage). It's closer to checkin. 

-it's on the south side of the strip closer to the mall and Trump tower. The location isn't bad if you have a car. Next to the Tram. 

-800degrees pizza is ok. Affordable....cheap eats as far as Vegas goes. 

Overall, I'd give this hotel 4 stars if it wasn't for the customer service and windows that aren't sound proof . The customer service wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. Doesn't seem like they care to go above and beyond for some of the issues I had experienced.",2,0,1

My review is really for the room. Although I loved the cute glam style of pinks and silvers\/grays and mirrors I was really disappointed in the size and the fact that there were no dressers to put your clothes in.

Rooms are small but clean. Don't expect coffee in the room since there is no coffee maker. The bar is filled with overpriced mini drinks and snacks.

The bed head is placed right by the window, which annoyed the heck out of me. Not only we could hear the noises outside, but also get a draft of wind coming through. It has a blind and a screen, which does little to block the sunlight coming through during the day. Consequently, we needed an eye patch to sleep later. Remember, you are sleeping right under the window.

Found food to be okay. We ordered room service which was punctual. No plates though. Everything was in a to go box.

Customer service and valet need improvement. The Las Vegas blvd valet is so far from check in area. We had to walk past the casino to be checked in. I would have prefer they had told us there was another entrance next to check in instead of making us walk with 2 kids for that long.

Also, when we needed help at concierge, there was no one to be found. Apparently, they like to walk around and chat with people. We waited 20 mins or so until someone came over to assist us.

A resort fee!!!!! for what!  I have not clue the one pool i could go to with my son was rinky dink tiny, we are talking motels have bigger pools. They didn't allow any toys in the pool but they also did not have enough beach balls with their logos for the kids either.  They should probably label themselves as an adult only place.

We were lucky enough to get upgraded to a suite in the Lux Tower and it really was beautiful with a mountain view! The room was also a really good size and the bathroom was very spacious with a double sink vanity. 

We took some time to explore the property and the pool looks really great! Unfortunately, the weather was a bit cold so we didn't have a chance to try it out. The restaurants on site were also really great and it was good to see that it was known as the ""foodie hotel on the Strip"" including Bazaar Meat, Umami Burger, Katsuya and Cleo. The only complaint I would have had about that is that we have all of the same restaurants here in LA...would've been nice to be able to try something that wasn't a chain. I really enjoyed The Perq (small coffee shop perfect for breakfast) and the Monkey Bar (which had unique cocktails).

Another thing we utilized was the monorail. The station is literally across the street which is super convenient. It was a 12 minute ride to the middle of the strip (Flamingo Hotel) and $12 for a 24 hour pass. I also loved the concierge services on site. Their office is beautiful and the staff was very helpful when we went to purchase show tickets through them.

Our stay was really great however I think we lucked out with our upgrade as I've seen how small and unfinished the regular rooms looked. Our room also wasn't cleaned on Sunday but since it wasn't a big deal to me, I didn't say anything. Working in hotels myself, I know how busy it can get on Sunday with check outs. The Ciel product line is amazing, I even went to the spa and purchased two additional bottles of lotion to bring home. Love it!

Rooms:   2stars. Weird, no top sheet on beds, have either sleep under the comforter or on the mattress cover. ( yes, standard ) I got another from housekeeping and made my bed proper. 

Casino :   2. small. 

Service : 5 

Other. 1. Another smoky casino. 
My beer tasted like smoke
My food tasted like smoke. 
My room filled with pot smoke , had to move. 
My room got loud. Guy next door playing rock music , actually not too loud in HIS ROOM, but rooms poorly insulated. 
Location. 2. Multi family housing nearby. 
Walking sketchy. 
Strip , where there's more gambling ambiance quite the hike. 

I don't get it 

I'm not sure what the hotels going for.im not a big casino person but everywhere else on the strip you are surrounded by these individual strong identities. ( Caesars for example. )

Metrosexual ?
Foppish ?
Millennial ?

I didn't find it either relaxing or interesting. 

Again. 

Food was great. 5 stars at least what I ate. 
But I didn't come here for the food.

------update. Next morning. 

Room stared to reek of pot smoke from the guy next door. 
Had to move. Front desk very apologetic about that. 

Later that night. Different and new room started to smell like cheap cigarettes 
Reeked. Couldn't sleep. 

Woke up with a headache and ugly puffy eyes. 

I had to stop working Half way through the day, headache and lack of sleep mistakes mandated that. 

Thanks SNS , I am miserable 3pm the next day. 

I'm sure someone somewhere might like this hotel. 
If sleep is part of your vacation needs and you don't like to wake up with your hair and lungs and luggage smelling like smoke. 

Avoid this place.",3,1,0

It was a little cheaper here during labor day so decided to stay here. Stay away if you are not attending a convention. Rather stay at anywhere else hotel than here. Checked in at 3AM on a Saturday but front desk made me wait over 30 minutes because ""their system was rebooting."" Was so exhausted from driving 7 hours from LA Friday night, and all I wanted to do was to just check in and sleep. The casino looked so sad and depressing that I ended up going to any other hotel to play. In the room, the shades have a picture of people staring at you when you pull the shades all the way down. So creepy. This place has a mini bar and water bottles in the room. One star for the dreadful checkin process and the creepy shades and the rather pathetic casino. One more thing, the guy who hails a cab for you tried to make me take a hotel car instead of a cab saying that I'd have to pay $25 to get to my destination. I decided to use a regular cab and the tab came out to $15. Used uber the rest of the times and cab rides were mostly $5 - $10 depending on where.

We moved from our room at Creaser's ONLY because this place was a Hilton - and I wanted the points. The SLS staff was great - and the swift - and respectful - and they gave us a nice upgraded room.

Of course we had to join the SLS gamblers club - which we did - and so we starter to use their incentives to gamble. Luckily we actually won money. But even if we had not - the hotel was determined to earn our loyalty and treat us right.

This is the kind of hotel that I like.",10,6,7

I booked a room way back during the holiday season of 2016 for a medical school interview and weekend trip. I had booked the reservation weeks in advance, yet had to wait over four hours for a clean room, was not allowed to check in as a family member, and was given a pretty rude check-in experience by an employee. It was a fiasco, to say the least.

My flight was delayed and the rental car I'd booked suffered a timing issue that took forever to rectify, so I ended up arriving at SLS around midnight on the day of my booking, which understandably is a later time than the check-in dictates. The first glitch happened when the employee at the front counter told me that my name wasn't on the reservation and moved to dismiss me before I could even begin to explain. I'd booked the reservation under a family member's SPG account since I don't usually travel that often, and I'd been on nine trips in the three previous months where I'd done the same thing and been able to check in without issue (and even had the SPG concierge tell my family and me that this would be of no concern). Apparently not so here, as providing my ID, my family member's information, and other security verification was waved off as inadequate. The only thing left to do was call my family during the middle of the night, wake up my father, and have him call SPG to manually add my name to the reservation. This was at 1am in the morning. The front desk employee was also short, dismissive, and essentially told me that I was being untruthful when I told her that this was the first time I'd encountered this issue in ten bookings.

When I came back to the counter to check in for real this time, the rude lady I had been talking to was replaced by a more pleasant male employee. I appreciated his kinder demeanor, but after he checked me in, he told me that there were no clean rooms available and that it would take at most an hour for one to be ""rush cleaned"" for me. This was frustrating, but he assured me that they would give me a call when the room was ready and it would most likely take less than an hour.

I went out for some food at this time (thank you, Las Vegas restaurants that close at 4am) and came back in 1.5hours, not having received any call about the room. When I inquired about whether a room had opened up, the employee gaped at me and seemed genuinely shocked that I was still waiting. He went to ""speak to a manager"" and came back to tell me that they were ""rush cleaning a room right now."" It was past 3am by this time and I was dead exhausted. I sat down on a bench to wait, and another customer asked me if I was waiting for a room to be cleaned as well (she said she'd been waiting for over two hours). To have multiple customers waiting for clean rooms for hours is just bad management and customer service.

My room was finally ready at just past 4am, and I pretty much fell into bed the minute I set down my bags. 

The room itself was fine, pretty minimalistic with interesting modern decor. There are no water heaters, coffee, coffee machines, or other additional amenities. The color schemes felt somewhat gothic to me, with heavy tones and untraditional designs, but I'm not sure if it was just my floor. I did like the full-length mirrors in the bedroom, and I thought the lighting behind them was pretty cool. I do wish the lighting had been brighter in the bathroom though, but I guess the dimness was to set an intimate ambiance.

Despite the more affordable pricing for SLS and the decent room, I think that so many customer service issues is indicative of problematic management and I would take my business elsewhere in the future. I'd rather pay a higher fee to not have to wait over four hours for a clean room I'd reserved in advance.",16,6,11

Heading to Vegas for a conference, I was curious about this new Tribute property that had opened.  I knew of the SLS Beverly Hills and SLS Miami by reputation, and decided to take a gamble on this kinda out-of-the-way property up at the end of the monorail and off the strip.

About a week before my arrival, I got an email from the SLS VIP desk following up on a question I'd asked my SPG Ambassador which detailed all the different room types in the 3 towers in the hotel, and offering any assistance or service ahead of my arrival.  Interesting...this is the sort of stuff I come to expect from St. Regis Butler service.  The day before my arrival, I reached out to ask if I could possibly drop off my bags early as my day cleared up far in advance of my planned 7PM check-in time, and they told me to come over as soon as I wanted to.

Arriving at the hotel, I was directed to a massive, secluded, glass-and-curtained lounge to the side of the main check-in area and welcomed there in true VIP fashion.  Offers of water or coffee, a quiet desk to go over details of my room, and the delightful news of an upgrade to their largest room in their LUX tower.  The team at the VIP lounge, from Romeo before my arrival, to Charmaine and Imelda at my arrival, and Samantha during my stay, were absolutely top-notch.

Now...on the topic of top-notch - the rooms in the LUX tower are stunning.  Living room with a couch that could comfortably seat 8, with a marble meeting table to seat 6 and a guest bathroom.  The bedroom had a couch\/loveseat that could easily fit 4, a massive bed with a mirror above it, and a gorgeous bathroom with twin sinks and a shower that could easily hold 4.  All of the furnishings were white, and the walls themselves covered in black-stenciled artistic hangings.  A W Hotel is going to be opening here in the coming months, and as someone who spends at least 50 nights a year in Ws, I truly hope they change nothing.  

Once you leave your room, make sure your first stop is at the Foxtail pool outside during the daytime.  Great chair service, and a really fun vibe throughout the day.  In the evenings, the Katsuya restaurant is not to be missed, and Foundry can host some fantastic artists (I managed to catch Old Dominion, Dustin Lynch, and Jana Kramer doing a closing act for the country music festival there).  The gaming here is kinda slow, which was actually very enjoyable, because I got a much better vibe here than any other Las Vegas hotel\/casino I've visited as the focus was more on food, nightlife, and fun.

About the only disappointing part of my stay in the hotel had to be the security.  I had a minor trip and fall in the garage - completely my fault and stupid of me, as complimentary valet services are included in your resort fee.  Unfortunately, the security staff told me that they couldn't even offer me alcohol wipes or bandages unless I filled out an incident report.  I get aversion to risk and being concerned about lawsuits, but that's just petty and unhelpful.  That's one very regretful star docked.

All in all though, I wouldn't stay anywhere else and cannot wait to be back.",3,3,1

I said, hi Im checking in and the the guy gets irritated and grabs my keys from me.  I get to the front desk and try to check in at about 1PM and it turned out to be a huge deal and she couldn't believe that we were early and was bothered to look up if a room was ready.  She finds a room and says we charge $20 for early check in..  ""sure""  whatever just get me to a room, after all we just traveled a round 700 miles or so and paid you six hundred something dollars for us to stand there and have people irritated at us for being there..  Get to the room and needed my shirts un wrinkled, that was a huge deal, the lady of course said they couldn't do it unless they dry cleaned it which would take 2 days and basically was doing everything in her power to not do it.  I had a few questions in the 2 days I was there about the ice machine which was apparently not on my floor, so I called the concierge desk and NOBODY answered, called guest services, NOBODY answered.  I thought I was in the twilight zone..  I called a total of 7 or 8 times where i got no answer..  What are you people doing down there??  I paid a bunch of money for you to be rude to me?  Or maybe this is a rude themed hotel??  I finally got ahold of someone who of course was irritated and asked for water and what do you think they said..  Of course, they don't have water, I had to pay $12 PLUS tip for water to be taken to my room.  Went and ate at the diner the 2nd night at around 3AM and they were so angry that we were there I can see them complaining in the kitchen that we were sitting at the counter..  Not 1 friendly person the WHOLE time and was soooo DISAPPOINTED in the service there that I will 100% not go there EVER again and will tell as many people as I can how terrible it was..

Not here at the SLS, which is actually a reincarnation of the former legendary Sahara.   I remember being in Vegas and passing the Sahara when she was still open.  Unfortunately when the economy slipped, the Sahara, which was no longer new and beautiful became a casualty.  SLS purchased that property, spent several hundred million $$ to more or less completely gut the old Sahara buildings and modernize everything about them, though there are some very cool throwbacks to the Sahara days, including some displays behind the check in desk with various photos of the former tenant of this property.

To be honest I was surprised to see the SLS priced as cheaply as it was; I found a site that was offering a special rate of $130\/night that came with a $150 spa credit (which I didn't use due to lack of time).  The $130\/night rate here was actually cheaper than the nightly rate at properties like the Stratosphere and Excalibur, which normally tend to have the cheapest rooms on the strip.  It should be noted that when I actually booked the room, I was charged an additional $57.24 in taxes, and $87 in fees.  Such is life when booking rooms in Vegas, though.

The SLS isn't for everyone.  While they do have some outstanding restaurants and the casino floor and bars are pretty standard, once you get up to the floors where the rooms are located, everything one sees is pretty much black and white monochrome (see my photos for more).  Hallways and corridors have black and white carpeting with a black and white reed-like pattern on the walls.  The walls in the rooms carry on the black\/white reed pattern with a bit of pink thrown in as well. The couch and bed are pure white, the black out shade covering the window behind the bed is a black and white photo, and save from the glass desktop which conceals a map of Vegas with a bit of color thrown in, most everything else is black and white..Including an odd print of a huge white glove on a black wall behind the white toilet in the bathroom.   

The WiFi here is free and speeds were fast enough for everything I needed to do, the bed was comfortable, the room was quiet and I slept well here on all 3 nights of my stay.  There's a large flat screen TV above the desk, a well stocked mini-bar and snack selection in each room (as well as a $20 sensual lovers kit that contains condoms, lube and a finger mounted vibrator!) and a digital combination safe in the bottom drawer of the mini bar.   

The desk staff during check in and when I had to have a new room key programmed were very friendly and accommodating, and there's a security guard posted before the entrance to each of the towers where the rooms are located, ensuring that everyone entering the elevator corridors has a room key and is actually a guest at the hotel.  

The only minor notes, aside from the black and white motif nearly everywhere one looks in the accommodation areas, is that rooms are outfitted with a shower only, no tub.  Also, while not a problem for me as I normally keep clothing in my suitcase until needed, there are no dressers or drawers to store your stuff in the rooms.  There's also no door on the closet, just an open cubby with hangers, just inside the entrance door.

In all, I'd consider this a very good stay in an updated and modern property that feels almost new (it should, as most of the interior spaces nearly are) that is priced reasonably.  Some people have mentioned that the SLS is a bit farther north on the strip than they'd like, but to be honest that wasn't an issue for me, as the monorail station is right there, ready to whisk you off to any location on the strip that you desire!",9,6,8

The check-in desk was pretty dark and it just gave off the impression that the hotel was trying to save on electricity. I had originally booked a room at this hotel for two reasons:

1. My other family members were staying at this hotel
2. I had stayed at the SLS Lounge in Los Angeles and I loved my stay with them. Everything was fabulous at that hotel.

This hotel however was just ok. The bar and mini area was pretty, elevator sections are nice, and the rooms are pretty interesting. The design of the rooms were different than most other hotel rooms. Our rooms were much smaller than I expected, our desk chair wasn't a rolling chair, and there weren't any tubs. Not sure why, but I expect there to be tubs for me to take bubble baths in when I stay at fancy hotels. My boyfriend's biggest complaint is that SLS markets themselves as a luxury hotel when they're really not. At least this Vegas one is not. It's halfway there, but not really there.

My brother and his gf upgraded their basic room to a luxury one and they weren't happy with their room either. They also did not have a tub. They had a bigger room with a super cute white couch, and a mirrored ceiling, but that's about it.

The hotel itself is very clean and the beds are very comfortable (even the exceptionally small twin bed they tried to put my six foot frame into my first night, somehow they figured that a single man traveling on his own needed the ADA bedroom WITH 2 TWIN BEDS. They corrected that the next morning.)

I've stayed in 3 rooms and they are all fairly small.

The only spot for coffee in the morning is called Perqs and the line in that place was ridiculous every morning during SEMA. I guess the coffee pot in the rooms would solve some of that headache but SLS room don't have them.

We ate at Cleo on the first night of this stay  and the food was really good and the service was awesome I highly recommend that location.

We ate at the Northside Cafe Saturday morning before checking out. The service was really slow and the room was so loud we couldn't even speak amongst the four of us. I would probably avoid this location if I stay there again even though the food was fairly decent.

Upsides-
Free parking and proximity to the convention center.

The Ugly...
I was there as part of a group (five rooms) all of which were paid for by the company. When I checked in I was told they were sliding my debit card for incidentals however they collected the full balance for the room and incidentals on my card leaving me with very little money to start the week. (also never gave me a print out\/receipt, I found out about the problem when my wife checked our checking balance the next morning)

When I attempted to get the front desk to handle it we called my office and everything was great and paid for but they still held onto my funds for 4 days. Worse yet, they took another $50 per day hold from my account for incidentals! 

I spent over 45 minutes on one occasion and another 30 minutes on a second occasion at the front counter trying to reverse the charges and they told me it was done. Again, it never happened until 4 days into the stay. 

I was never offered an apology or anything of that nature from the front desk staff let alone management (Maybe they were unaware of the desk staff's blunder before this review) 

Sorry for another huge review but like I always say this is about how we spend our money more than about talking up locations to try and get freebies.

Honest reviews make sure you spend your money with someone who cares enough to make your stay awesome!

Super pricey, sketchy clientele who I am sure we're selling drugs, cocky management and not a very good experience at all.  My wife and I figured we would finally go and check out the SLS and have a dinner there and gamble a little bit.  When we pulled into the garage there were some people hanging out and looked a bit ""scary"" so we proceeded to another floor where there were more people just hanging out so we found a parking spot pretty far away that we felt comfortable parking in.  We went inside and first thing we heard was someone yelling F U to someone else and their conversation was pretty heated, we thought we were going to walk into a fight.  We scurried by them and found ourselves in the casino, which was pretty empty.  We found a restaurant and checked out the menu and  figured we would need an Amex black card to eat there so we continued on.  Looked at another menu and told ourselves we won't be eating here.  We tried to find a video poker game with reasonable odds but could not find one and with all the club people hanging around we didn't feel all that comfortable so we decided to leave.

1. Location. To be blunt, it's at the ghetto end of the Strip, and also closest to the most ghetto hotels on the Strip (Stratosphere and Circus Circus). If this is your first time in Vegas and you plan on doing sightseeing along the main part of the Strip, I'd suggest staying somewhere more centrally located (or at the very least rent a car). While yes, a stop along the LV Monorail is quite conveniently located directly behind the hotel, it's $5 per ride (!) per person (!!). IIRC it's the most expensive public transportation in the U.S., if not per world, at least in terms of distance-per-dollar. (You can, however, get a 24-hour pass for $12. Still, you're waaaaaaaaay better off either cabbing it or renting a car if you're traveling in a group. Also, the monorail is rather *inconvenient* for visiting numerous hotels along the Strip, e.g. Wynn\/Encore, Bellagio and everything in the CityCentre complex.)

2. Crowd. Varies quite a bit: weekdays it's mostly a wide mix of tourists, and on weekends it's very, *very* L.A. (As one would expect, given the hotel's sister property there.) While I can't personally fathom the idea of paying a $150 minimum for table service merely for sitting out by the pool, that's what you have to do if you're *not* staying there. (Private cabanas are $500.) The hotel's too new to determine where on the hipness gauge its weekend-daytime pool scene looks like, but suffice it to say it has some *serious* competition (Marquee, HRH, Encore, etc.). All that said: for the moment, I'd probably pick the Cosmopolitan or Hard Rock if I was looking for this particular type of scene, at least on weekends.

3. Property (physical). Location aside, there's also no getting around the fact that most of the rooms a) have no view, b) have tiny windows even if they do have a view, and c) face the parking garage. The latter is not fun if, say, someone's car alarm goes off at 4am. The pool area, by Vegas standards, is definitely on the small side, and also has a fairly basic layout. The complex's interior design is interesting, but at the same time falls back on *way* too many Philippe Starck cliches, and also cliches in general (antler chandeliers? seriously? those went out of fashion a decade ago...). Finally, the front desk is the size of one I'd expect to see at a Hampton Inn in the middle of nowhere, not a 1700-room property. I don't even want to *think* about the madhouse it will eventually look like once it's fully up-and-running and booked to near-capacity on weekends, but I would strongly suggest management devise either an expansion of it or, if space won't permit it, install self-check-in kiosks. Yes, I know the latter isn't very ""boutique-y"" or ""reflective of luxury."" It is, however, vastly superior (from a guest's perspective) to spending 45 minutes in line waiting to check in.

Overall, I'm afraid I have to lower my rating to three stars, even taking into account the usual service issues that come with all brand-new hotels. The Cosmopolitan tops it in nearly every way: location, room size, ""hipness quotient,"" amenities, proximity to the awesomeness of CityCentre. Even in terms of off-the-main-Strip hotels, I'd go with the Hard Rock over SLS. While I would unhesitatingly recommend dining at the Bazaar -- which, even in its early stages, has already leapt to the top of my list of favorite Vegas eateries (though I think the word's already out, too: the place was packed when I dined there on a Thursday night) -- there's not a single other element of the hotel, save for price (for now), that tops its local competition.",0,1,0

Now that I have had a few weeks(and about 5 visits) since that time to calm down, I feel I should update it to a more appropriate rating.

(+) I still get good play here, even on the days I don't win
(+) never seems to be too busy most times
(+) employees are usually pretty friendly

(-) parking elevator still sucks ass and half of the time we end up just taking the stairs...hey, at least it's still  free....for now..Not only that, the last time we were here (3\/13\/16) as we were walking down the stairs due to the slow ass elevator, there was a group of about 5 or 6 guys smoking a blunt(that's weed for you total squares out there)in the staircase(?whatever you call it) Where is the security??
(-) what is it with the strange and smelly homeless guys that are allowed to just walk around and creep on people?? This happens, like, a lot! Weird ass people just sitting at the next bank  of machines just staring at people playing, like fucking vultures ready to strike if you hit something. I wish SLS would do something about this...really kills the fun vibe of the place.
(-) By and large I am finding that the food options pretty much blow here.

Anyways, I am here quite often and do enjoy playing here....so I will be back and if I have anything more to add I will let you all know! 


3.5 stars.

Also the beds were very comfortable and warm! I have stayed at the Quad and the Stratosphere which were both old, disgustingly dirty and boring!!! The reviews for this place sounded like the same level as those places and the price for what you get is amazing and I definitely would recommend to stay here to my friends! 

It is far away from the strip but an easy monorail ride to the center of everything else! We were also here for an expo at the Convention Center which was conveniently a 5min monorail ride. I am definitely staying here again!

You get a full stocked mini bar with snacks, but there was no price list. There happened to be a house keeper right outside our door so I asked her for a price list or where I could get one. I was told that everything comes included in the price of the room. Too good to be true, right? Yes. I called the front desk to double check if this was a fact, they said no and stated there should be a price list. When I told them there wasn't they forwarded my call to housekeeping, whom told me they would send me one. Never showed up. But that's just a small problem, nothing major. My issue was with the pool. If I have to pay a $30 resort fee whether I use the pool area or not, I expect a clean pool. The pool was disgusting! There was trash all over the bottom of it, which I didn't notice until I got in. When I went to get out from the opposite direction, it was even worse. There was a lot of hair, old lit marches and a bunch of debris floating near the stairs (which are wide set). When the sun hit the pool right, I could see a weird greasy looking residue sitting on top of the water, which also felt slimy. Gross! Needless to say, I got out and took a long shower.

- The carpet: I am happy to report I saw no hay or animal fur on the carpet :p

- Parking garage: The elevators were fully functioning (though stuffy) and in and out access to\/from Las Vegas Blvd. was a breeze. I also did not have to walk through the casino to the registration area from the parking garage. 

- Service: Lines were slow-moving at the registration desk, but then again, it was 11am on a Sunday, so many people were checking out. Once we got to the front, the front desk agent who checked us in was friendly - though it would have been nice if he had told us about some hotel features such as room service. It wasn't until after our stay that I saw on their Twitter that you could order food from some of their restaurants through room service. Btw there is no room service menu in the room; rather, you access the menu through the TV in your room. (At least that is what I gathered from the Tweet.)

Lots of security guys around, and they all seemed nice enough, some with smiles and greetings. One approached us as we were taking a selfie but failing to squeeze us all in the picture lol. I had remembered a reviewer saying that they were told pictures were not allowed inside the casino. Well, this security person who approached us offered to take the picture for us! 

Service was good in the shops and restaurants inside the hotel as well. 

- Hotel worker uniforms: Some people are really nit picky! The plaid jackets and monkey vests did not bother me.

- The casino: The industrial style ceilings with the exposed piping did not bother me either. And yes, the casino is small, but it did not feel cramped to me.

- The rooms: Upon walking into the room (World Tower with one King bed) my first thought was that it felt like a motel room :p Rooms at SLS are definitely smaller than most other hotel rooms I've stayed at in Vegas. But the room eventually grew on me. The bed was comfortable and the room was just fine size-wise for two people. Btw in pictures it looks like there are no windows in the World Tower rooms but there are. The window is behind the bed - it just looks like there isn't one when the shades are drawn As for the noise from the a\/c, it did not seem too loud for me. But it could get really cold when on and really warm when off. Somewhere in the middle would have been nice.

* One thing about the rooms is that they could work on the cleanliness factor. There were some stains on the walls and small hairs on our towels and bathroom counter when we walked in. 
* Don't know if this can be fixed but it takes five seconds to change channels when channel surfing, and one time our TV just froze. Turned it off for 10 minutes and when turned back on it was working fine again.

- Restaurants: I don't think I read too many bad reviews about their restaurants - I really liked every restaurant I tried there during my stay. It rained every day of my stay but it worked out perfectly because there was no need to go anywhere with all the great food options at the hotel! Btw I smelled the most amazing chocolate chip cookie smell while passing by their coffee shop but did not see any on display. I should have inquired about that because after the fact I read a tip or review on how their chocolate chip cookie was really good, and by the time I went back down they had chocolate chip cookies but that freshly baked smell was gone :( Also, they don't have hot chocolate on the menu at the coffee shop but if you ask they can make you some.

I think my favorite Vegas hotels are still Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental but SLS is not bad at all. They've got some great deals, cozy rooms, and amazing restaurants so a stay here is definitely a-ok and then some :)",14,2,5

I love the vintage stye. The room was very spacious with a couch the length of one wall, a desk area, a shower with two heads, his and her sinks, and a large closet area. Not to mention the robes were super comfy, felt like a down comforter. The bed was also very comfortable and the mirror on the ceiling was a nice touch. The room definitely made up for the underwhelming casino floor. Lots of good restaurants to pick from but we only made it to 800 degrees (pizza) which was good and the only place open after midnight which is a let down. The staff was friendly enough and quick. It's kind of far from the main attractions but there's a monorail that picks up from the sls and takes you down the strip making various stops, $5 one way $12 for a day pass. Much cheaper than a cab!

I've done the Vegas thing probably 30 times...since back when the Excalibur was the hot new hotel, haha, so I'm not really that concerned with staying in the heart of the Strip. 

Actually, I've come to appreciate the benefits of staying away from it, thanks to prior stays at Green Valley Ranch, Red Rock and the Westin Lake Las Vegas. You always get more for your money, better personal service, and less of a crowded mess. But if that's your thing, then more power to you, don't stay here.

I've long been a fan of the SBE brand, and booked my stay through Hotwire. So the room (in the World Tower) was a whopping $63. Sweet. Even with the tax ($14) and resort fee ($28), that's $105\/nt. for a room in a 4 star hotel. Awesome. When I was checking in, the lady next to me was using a Gilt coupon, so I imagine there are a lot of deals to be had on this place right now. Remember: only suckers pay retail.

Check-in was a breeze, rooms were clean, bed was comfy and the staff was really friendly and professional. Got put on the list for both their nightclub, Life, and their lounge, Sayers Club. LOVE not having to pay a cover or wait in line.

I don't gamble, but for those who do, the casino has everything you'd want. I enjoyed hanging out at their pool, the FoxyTail. I liked the Philip Stark \/ Gensler design, but I guess taste is personal. 

And I liked the more upscale, young professional crowd. 

As someone who lives in LA, I have to admit it's sort of weird traveling to Vegas, just to basically access all of the brands you'd normally visit in LA. The Griddle? Yup, it's here. Sayers Club? Here. Katsuya? Here. Bazaar by Jose Andres? Here. Fred Segal? Here. Basically, I was leaving LA...to come to LA, but with a Vegas twist. But there was something comforting about that too, because you know what you're getting and the prices are pretty much the same.

Honestly, probably 80% of the crowd seemed like they were from LA. Same people I see around Beverly Hills, WeHo and the Grove \/ Melrose area.

So, 4 stars for me. I really dug the place. I will take a moment to respond to some of the complaints that I see on here:

1) The SLS is off the Strip?? Well, no duh. Did you do any research before booking your stay here? Didn't you know it was off the strip like 3 years ago when Sam Nazarian bought the place?! Not knowing the location of the hotel you book isn't on them, it's on you.

2) The rooms are small? They're rooms, not suites. I found them to be pretty standard size hotel rooms. And they come with like a 65 inch tv, which was nice.

3) You had issues with the staff? I guess everyone's experience is different. I thought the staff was better than the Beverly Hills location.",6,0,3

It went smooth. They have a $150 per night incidental hold policy that goes down to $200 per stay if you block charges from being made to the room. And there's a $28\/nt resort fee **side-eye**  

Room: 
I stayed in the world tower. The room is nice, 2 people would be comfie in here. The only complaint I have is the photo art over the bed. The piece in my room depicts a crowd of people that maybe at a concert or something. It throws off the whole decor of the room! It's kinda creepy to me. I don't know these people hanging over my bed, watching me sleep, and what the hell are they looking at?  It's so random and does not flow with the rest of the decor in the room, kinda irritating. 

The bed is comfie. And there are mirrors with a LED light frame.. Awesome...just take these stupid photos over the bed away! I did find that the photo art was a shade that retracted. So it was retracted my whole stay. Please replace that element with some black out drapes for those who wish to sleep in. 

The Monkey in the Room: There were a few reviews that felt the monkey theme in the check in  lobby  and bar were racist. I didn't think so. Weird and probably not the best theme choice for a hotel trying to present themselves as ""upscale"" , yes, racist, no. 

Food:
Umami burger was disappointing. The Cali Burger was meh. The Black Razz Mojito cocktail and truffle em'  fries were the highlight of my meal. 

The Perq coffee spot makes a good mocha. Its pricey, which I guess is a perk for the company,  but good. Railroaded by convience I guess. Small mocha and 1 Madeline $9 ijs. 

I would stay there again because of the price and the location, the rooms are nice to me. No its not in short walking distance to anything but it's attached to the monorail line. That makes it a breeze to get anywhere on the strip.

Great customer service here. Everyone I came in contact with was super hospitable.   I would have gave SLS 4 stars but the $150\/nt incidental hold and 28\/nt resort fees are exorbitant.",5,0,0

Valet was fast and friendly. They told us they weren't supposed to take ice chests on the bell cart (stupid) but did anyway. I literally checked in within 5 minutes. There were at least 6-7 workers. The elevator was fast. When they brought up our bags and ice chest we noticed that they filled up our ice chest with much more ice (awesome!!). The rooms are a bit on the small side, but it's not like I'm trying to do running back-flips or anything. The decor is nice. The pull down curtain has a bunch of young white people on it which was kind of weird. The lighting in the room was awesome! Free wifi without limits or a password needed. The bath products seemed to be decent (I only used the lotion and very much liked it). The shower head felt great. The bed is comfy. 

The only thing I took a star off for was location. It is connected to the monorail, which is ok. It takes you all the way to the MGM which is where I like to roam around.

The bathroom had more amenities than what I am used to...probably the best selection that I have seen in many years. In fact, everything was impressive until I had to do some work with my laptop at the desk. 

And thus, for me, a 2 star reduction. For starters, the desk is a glass top, with a second top above that is in a permanent askew position to the lower top...why??  Do these designers ever STAY in a hotel? Ok, I can live with working on a desktop that is at an angle, but I can't live with the chair.  

This chair is so funny and inappropriate, that I called guest services to ask if this was the regular chair?  The rude, yes rude, young gentleman said he had no idea what I was taking about, and transferred me to the front desk where I was told that it was the correct chair and that each tower had its own unique furniture. I was in the World tower and no offer was made to move me to the other tower.  

So, about this chair...picture the chair used in a kindergarten class but made of hard laminated wood, and not nearly as comfortable for an adult to sit in. After 30 min I had to stop work and lay in the bed as my back started hurting.

We are locals so once in a while we go to Wynn or other nice resorts to gamble just for fun. This is the worst place I have ever been to on the strip. First of all - the dealers at the craps table don't even know how to pay winnings. There was even one time when a dealer gave my chips to another player. How horrible, this place really scraped the bottom of the barrel when they hired. Even the pit boss took 5 minutes to make payouts because they apparently can't do math. I had my clutch on the arm rests and dealer asked me to put it down. You think i'm stealing from this place? 

Design:
The ceiling is exposed piping which is supposed to look modern and industrial but instead looks cheap. This place was so empty on the Saturday night we went. I can see why. Bad service, bad design, I expected more from Sam\/SBE who puts together the nicest clubs in LA.

Our rental car was a Nissan Altima with a full tank of gas when we picked it up at Enterprise Rent-a-Car on Friday, Nov. 17, 2017. 
We only drove it from the McCarran airport car rental location to our hotel, the Palazzo, on Friday. Maybe 10 miles at the most.
I know it had to be there because in order to open the gas tank, you have to manually push a button inside the car that pops open the gas tank door.
We always lock our car when we are parking it ourselves.
It's such a yucky feeling!!!   Just be warned.
As far as the hotel itself, it was pretty barren. I was a little taken back by the lack of people in the casino on a Saturday night.
Cleo's Restaurant is the BEST! Always great service and the most awesome Mediterranean food. 
Just park your car yourself or take a taxi...",0,1,0

Bad: service, service, service, even months after grand opening.
1.Had to stand for 45 minutes in line to register and get the key. They obviously have never heard of the ""queuing theory"" for a problem that is so easily solvable .
2. They rudely told me that I cannot checkout at 12 instead of 11. Every other hotel I have stayed in, allow that.
3. Their tv-based checkout did not allow checkout. Error message.  
4. Called to checkout and was on hold for so long, I left the room in frustration 
5. Checkout counter had no sign. Stayed in the wrong line to checkout and after 25 min they told me to go the last line. I asked them why no sign this line is for checkout and they just said they r sorry but no explanation!
6. Another damn 30 minutes in right line to checkout....
7. Staff at regular area like robots! They can only recite what they were taught and could not for a second be creative.
8. $28 mandatory resort fee but the pool was closed due to whatever reason. I gave up!
Really? To go through all these just to checkout! I mean u spent hundreds of millions to renovate this place but can't have a simple system in place!

-- 4 of us sharing two beds (the beds are TINY, which is why the rooms have so much space), but plenty of room for us to all get wedding-ready at the same time. 
-- Full length mirrors everywhere. Not on the ceiling, so not in a creepy way, but in a 'we built this place so you could all get gorgeous at the same time with plenty of mirror space' kind of way.
-- our window overlooked south lv blvd. beautiful. the lights, the sun rising and setting... gorgeous
-- Odd choice of decor. an enlarged photo of what looked like a modern day woodstock. lots of white people, cigarettes in hand, at a concert maybe? long hair, probably un-showered? odd. it hung down from the window, and we were relieved that we could pull it up like blinds and not have to look at it anymore

** CUSTOMER SERVICE ** A+
-- We were early for check in, so they put a rush on our housekeeping so we could check in early and relax before the evening's events
-- We entered the room to a note on the nightstand with the name of the woman who was our designated housekeeper and a phone number to call if we needed anything. There's something to be said about the number of times we called for extra towels, the speed in which they were delivered to us, and then the FOLLOW UP CALL to confirm if we received what we asked for. Wow... impressive

** LOCATION ** C+
-- The fact of the matter is, I wouldn't consider this hotel 'on the strip', as is stated on the website. Almost across from the Stratosphere, you really have to take a taxi to get to the main strip area. 4 of us together paid about $5 each per trip from place to place (we traveled as far as the Palms & Hard Rock Casinos to Margaritaville). During the summer time heat, its just too hot to walk from the SLS to the strip, though you could if the temps were cooler

** RESTAURANTS ** A-
-- We ate at the Northside Cafe twice. Both times my meal was just phenomenal. They are open 24 hrs and serve breakfast all day. Give yourself plenty of time--- they aren't quick, but they are good
-- Had coffee at the coffee shop right there by the check in area. You'll spend $5+ for anything fancier than a regular coffee, but the coffee is fresh, strong, and you can add shots of espresso or booze, depending on what type of debauchery you're trying to get into or recover from

** AIRPORT TRANSFER ** B
There was a miscommunication about our pickup from the airport. We were specifically told a shuttle would come every 30 minutes to the airport. That was incorrect. There is a free shuttle every hour (they leave the hotel at the top of the hour). The hotel isn't marked with anything that indicates SLS hotel, so someone took pity on us roasting in the shuttle section of the airport for an hour and finally pointed us in to the unmarked shuttle that was just about to leave for the airport without us. Don't worry about standing next to a particular stall either... the unmarked shuttle doesn't have a particular pick up place at the airport. You need to ask every unmarked shuttle that pulls up if they are going to the SLS.

Super easy and convenient on our way back to the airport. Instead of waiting at the taxi stand, you'll wait at the entrance to the left of the taxi stand (if you're at the hotel, you'll know what I mean), and the shuttle comes by there at the top of the hour with a free, direct route to whatever terminal you're flying out of. 

** OVERALL **
I'd stay here again. I'd probably rent a car if I did because the rest of the strip is driving distance in my opinion, and I got tired of forking over cash to taxi drivers.",0,0,0

No fridge and microwave in the room!
oh you may request a fridge but there's a fee!!!

we didn't get to see the pool though and did not have to use the valet service and still have to pay resort fee!!!
Resort fee is so expensive

they do have security checking your key card before you get in to the elevator, that's plus to me! Other hotels don't provide that. So basically outsider can walk in and out and wonder around the rooms!! it can be scary especially if their intentions its not good !!

Was dropped off by Uber at the casino entrance (was kindly told by a floor manager that the drop off was on the other side of the hotel - why? At that point, it's too late, right? A simple welcome would have been appropriate.) Anyway, the look and tone of the hotel was great - very chic and stylized, and check in was fast. Entering the room for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised, the room looked EXACTLY as in pictures. The room was spacious enough for two people and very functional. We dined at two of the food offerings, Umami Burger, the Northside Cafe and the food was excellent. For the month of May the hotel eateries were offering a 50% discount to military veterans, so my service was acknowledged and we saved a little money as well. The location is not on the strip, just north of Circus Circus, but there's Uber\/Lyft, the Monorail, taxi, and the city bus as well, so getting around wasn't a problem at all. My finance and I took the bus  ($5 each for 24hours) for some non-tourist shopping, and to Fremont Street. The casino was a bit small, but fun and the cigarette smell was almost non-existent, which is light years beyond most Vegas casinos. We were there for Mother's Day and I had flowers delivered to the hotel as a surprise, however, the bell service could not find the flowers and stated they had not received any flowers even though I had proof that someone at the hotel signed for them. 45 minutes later the flowers were ""found"" but the surprise was ruined by having to call the florist and having to go back and forth with the hotel for a half hour.

Everything has been updated and is super artsy. We walked around the entire property and was done in 5 minutes. It's that small. A lot of the restaurants weren't even open and the ones that were open weren't busy. I wasn't fond of the smell they were pumping throughout the building. It kinda smelled like old lady. 

As for the room itself, the decor was awesome. I liked the light-up mirrors on each side of the wall. However, the room was small. I felt like my dorm room in college was bigger. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but you get the picture. The bathroom was clean and modern as well. I didn't like how the AC was blowing right in my face while I was sleeping. It made for an uncomfortable night always looking for a blanket. 

The pool wasn't crowded at all. We found seats right away. Not too many kids so that's a plus. I still don't get why people bring kids to Vegas, but whatever. The attendants didn't care where people sat because people were choosing to sit in the cabanas. Of course pool food and drinks are on the pricier side. But holy hell service was awful. Our server's name was Candace and I'm sorry to say, she was an idiot. It took her about 15 minutes to bring us a water bottle. There was a lot of standing around at the bar not doing anything. And when we ordered alcohol from her, she never even brought us our drinks even though she walked by us 3 times after taking our order. Maybe she forgot, who knows? Obviously she didn't care bout getting tipped. My bf had to go up to the bar himself and get the drinks. I used to be a cocktail server back in the day and that is just unacceptable. 

All in all, we had a good staycation. I don't know if we will be back, but I wouldn't be opposed to it.",8,5,5

The SLS was offering 20% off any room so we got a basic room and were fairly impressed. Although not extremely spacious, the rooms were very chic and contemporary. I love that the rooms are full of floor length mirrors, which makes the SLS perfect for a girls trip to Vegas. The hotel itself is new, so the inside was slightly less impressive. However, I must say that I really enjoyed breakfast at the Griddle Cafe..I think I will probably be back just for breakfast while in Vegas. We called the front desk because we wanted a toothbrush\/toothpaste delivered to our room, and not only did they deliver it right away, but the front desk called just to make sure we actually received it okay.

They finally put me in the lux tower but in a king bed with 3 girls. I booked two queens. when you walk into story tower its a little odd. Once you get off on a floor its night and day from the rest of the hotel. Shitty. smells like smoke. Get into the room and its like a tin can. Its also so dark and the vibe is so off. I will say lux tower is totally different. smells good and the rooms are way better. The closet and fridge were in the bathroom lol So that was so odd! cabs to the right part of the strip ran about twenty. so factor that in your stay pricing. You might as well pay more to stay closer. It all makes sense. PLEASE CHECK YOUR BILL WHEN LEAVING.

That went absolutely no where, and I found myself shelling out an extra $20 to check in 3 hours early. Dude! I'm a freakin local, at least give me an early check in!!! WTF!!

I guess there is a reason that SLS profits are dwindling. Cater to the locals! Do something for us. Treat us right! We can be your biggest advocate. I asked for the summer special for locals that includes the free mini bar. They freakin told me I had to book it in advance under a separate rate!

Location:
It's definitely far from the main part of the Strip, as it's about a block from Stratosphere. Luckily though, this hotel is part of the Monorail (it's the last stop), which takes you closer to the strip for $5\/ride. $5\/ride is steep, but they do have 1-2 day unlimited passes. We got a 2-day unlimited pass that was originally $22, but the Rock & Roll Marathon was taking place that weekend, which offered a promo for $18\/2-day unlimited pass. Not bad! If you use it 4 times, you've already used the value. Plus you save on all the Uber rides that are around $10\/ride. Once again, the hotel is removed from the main part of the strip (although technically on it), so it's a quieter spot. If quieter is your preference, maybe this is for you. If you're there for a bachelorette\/bachelor weekend, maybe you want to stay at a hotel closer to the strip for more liveliness!

Room:
When I looked up the pictures online, they kind of scared me lol. There were paintings of angels on the walls, with gaudy looking colors. But when we arrived in our room, it was totally fine. The hallways (on our floor anyway) had pink\/black paint, tastefully done. Kind of whimsical, not scary at all. The room itself was the same style of painting. There were lots of mirrors, on both sides of the room, creating that infinity effect. The room itself is on the older side - SLS kept the basic structure of the Sahara hotel, but remodeled the inside. The furniture is all modern. The room is on the smaller size, but perfect for a couple. The windows are the older smaller ones, not floor to ceiling. The bathroom was overall clean, but had the ""wet towel"" smell on the shower curtain. The towels were the scratchy ones, could definitely use an update. The bed was WONDERFUL though - so comfortable! I also loved how there was a couch at the end of our bed. 

Value: 
We got the room for ~90\/night. It was offered at a 30% discount, but it did not include the $32\/day resort fee! (honestly, you'll have to pay that everywhere now though). We also received a promo for free $50 dining\/beverage credit, which was nice. Just FYI, if you have the promo too, the snacks and mini-bar are also included into that credit! I usually am not into those sorts of amenities, but the snacks were Jose Andres potato chips, white chocolate popcorn, candy, etc. Everything was nicely packaged and looked gourmet. My bf and I were about to open the chip bags, but realized that they were expired. Huge bummer. They weren't even expired recently - it was from January and March of 2017! Gross. 

Service:
We tried making several phone calls during our stay to the front desk, but each time we called, the line was busy. It was very bizarre. Anyway, they didn't put a price sheet for the snacks in the room. When I asked them at the front desk, she said she'd stick one in our room once we had the ""do not disturb"" sign off (how they knew that was kinda creepy, but I'm guessing all hotels are taking extra measures after what happened at Mandalay Bay). Anyway, they never put the price sheet in there! Bummer. They did give us early check-in for free though, which was nice. However, the only room available was a handicap room, or we had the option of waiting until 3pm. I guess it was a packed weekend. 

Pool:
It's an okay pool, not huge, but 3 separate small ones. There's a bar there too if you want to get a drink. The lounge chairs are pretty comfortable, but a lot of them seemed dirty, so definitely put your towel down before you sun bathe! They had okay music at the pool, but what I found distracting (that the hotel doesn't have control over) was this helicopter that was circling several times, every 3 minutes. This was kinda frustrating for those of us just trying to relax out there!

Dining:
We didn't dine at any restaurants here, but it seemed like they had a good selection. I've had Umami Burger in SF and LA, and tried Jose Andres' restaurants in LA also. The sushi restaurant (Katsuya) looked great too, but we just didn't have enough time to eat there. They were only open for dinner, which was a bummer. We did take advantage of the Monkey bar near the front desk, and we got drinks here with our free dining credit. Drinks were great, service was nice too. 

Casino:
Super small. I don't gamble, but my bf did here. It's very quiet - not sure what your preference is for gambling, but this is on the smaller side. It's nice that they do have some tables though.

Overall, not sure if I want to stay here next time. It was a decent hotel, nothing against it, but I just want to stay more in the hub of the Strip!",0,0,0

I'm giving this place 3.5 stars and not 4 because this hotel is far from the strip and they do not provide complimentary rides to any of the nearby hotels like Trump does for its guests. Although the monorail is not far way, it is still a plain to get around.
 
Also, I am giving this hotel 3.5 out of 5 stars due to the lack of room service after 11p.m.

When you do get a chance to order room service, they bring your food (from northside cafe) in a to go\/take out box instead of wheeling up a table and keeping your food warm on plates. They have the nerve to charge you an in room dining fee when they do not properly serve you the way Aria or other hotels do. No plates, plastic utensils, and etc.

Overall, when you get past the room service,  I really liked this hotel and appreciated the Fedex\/business center for allowing me to print out my boarding pass free of charge. 

The rooms are clean and beds are comfortable. The design is very contemporary and simple without looking cheap or fancy, just modest in a good way.

I guess the only thing I didn't like about the hotel scheme was the black wall paper they put on each floor. That color looked depressing before entering your room. Once you did enter your room, the pastel pink ceilings and wallpaper was cute and brightened me right up.",1,0,0

-Modern style decor; mirrors that light up, brightly lit floor at the entrance, clean bathroom with sliding door entrance.

-Beautiful view of sunrise\/set.
-Fitness center had a variety of machines to use, and offered free towels and water bottles.
-A variety of restaurants downstairs.


Cons:
-Snacks\/drinks were not restocked by the time we checked in. They charged us for that. After we complained, they lifted the charge, but never restocked. So even if we wanted to have drinks\/snacks, we weren't going to get them.
-The hot water didn't work the first night we stayed so we had to take cold showers.
-Housekeeping would only come to make the bed-didn't change the sheets. 
-Walls are paper thin -you could hear people walking up and down the halls.
-Expected to have a little coffee machine, or tiny fridge, but the only accesories we had other than our empty snack\/drink area was an ice bucket-other accessories (like a bottle opener) were missing from our room. But other family members in another room had theirs.

Regardless we were pretty comfortable and pleased with our stay. Highlights were the comfy bed, spacious room, friendly staff and good food venues within. Negatives were that it is pretty far down the strip so walking was not really an option, especially if one is wearing fancy shoes. Other negative we experienced was that the A\/C made our room smell strongly of weed, like contact high status. Last major bummer was when trying to enjoy the pool it seemed we needed to reserve it since every seat had a reserved sign even though it was quite empty. When I tried to reserve a cabana I got the run around, sent to different people and I ended up giving up. Other than those things we had a pretty pleasant stay for the price.

It felt like they just painted over the mold of the previous owner. Like when they're trying to sell you a house full of flaws and they just cover it up with fresh paint.
That was the vibe I felt from the design and architecture. Not much renovation just Lots of lighting techniques to give the illusion of a sleek and modern feel to an old structure. 

SERVICE was great. The cocktail waitresses were always in sight and attentive, why I added an extra star to this review. 
However, I saw many patrons at the center bar waiting and trying to get the bartenders attention for quite a while. 
I even heard some express frustration.

I went to check out what all the hype was about and I was beyond disappointed. Since I have to give it a star to be able to write a review the star will be for their amazing website and hype about the place. It looks nothing like the pictures on their website. The casino floor is very small with slot machines all over the place. It's only been open for a few days and the cocktails servers looked miserable. The center bar in the casino floor had a few customers and four bartenders standing around.The decor of the restaurants was not bad, but every single restaurant looked overstaffed with about 3-5 employees standing at the podium. The overall feeling of the casino is gloomy and a cheap version of Cosmopolitan. 

I went to The Sayers Club and ordered a gin & tonic. Server didn't ask what kind of gin I would preferred and served me new amsterdam gin for $14. Which was not a big deal, because I'm used to prices on the strip. After asking for my check it turns out that my gin tonic cost me $18.21 in addition to the $14 they added a service charge of 4% and 18% gratuity. After taxes and all the extra charges I ended up paying $18.21 for one drink. I'm a cocktail server at a lounge on the strip and I can't even imagine how upset the costumers would  be to pay $18.21 for a drink that was $14. Their specialties drink cost $18 which means after taxes , gratuity and service charge you would end up paying like $23 for one drink. Simply ridiculous for a drink that is being served in a plastic cup. 

Save yourself a trip and don't bother going to the SLS. All the bad reviews are accurate. SLS needs serious improvements if they want to stay open. I was hoping it would be a nice place for locals to go since it's off the strip. Instead I get the feeling that not many locals will go back.",11,3,2

Let's just say, I went from VERY excited (with what I thought I could expect from the SLS brand), to VERY apprehensive (I read the bad yelp reviews 5 mins before we arrived at the hotel, as we were driving along the strip) to, actually really liking it (after I adjusted my expectations accordingly.) 

Now, if you're coming here expecting the same SLS in Beverly Hills, you will be immensely disappointed. It is no where near as classy and luxurious. At all. The SLS in Las Vegas kinda reminds me of the ACE hotel in Palm Springs. A younger, hipster-cooler version of the SLS Beverly Hills, shall we say? It feels very laid-back, and LA. 

But lets start what a few things I DIDN'T like: 

-The service. The service wasn't bad, or rude per say. They just don't have their act together and are incredibly disorganized. When we called to book two rooms, we specified that we would need connecting rooms. We get there and it's not set up. We wait, guy comes back and says he found us connecting rooms for an extra $15 per night per room. We take it. We go up to the room and it's NOT connecting. So I go all the way back down and wait in line for 15mins just to talk to him again (They only have 3 check in \/check out counters thus, the wait). When I finally get to talk to him again (His name was Dominique, btw) I explain that he made a mistake and our rooms are in fact NOT connecting, he tells me ""I don't know which rooms are connecting or not cos the floor plan the hotel gives us doesn't tell us if it's connecting"". Uhhhh, okay. That's not my problem, is it?! You should have your act together by now & even if you don't, telling me that doesn't solve ANYTHING for me. He then says, ""I need your patience and corporation because it's not my fault"". Look, even if that might be true, YOURE NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT. He then makes things worse by saying ""I have to physically run up to each room to check if it's connecting so it could take a long long time, I can't promise how long"". That in itself was okay but it was HOW it said it. It just sounded so condescending. I guess what I'm trying to say is 1. It's the hotels fault and they really need to get their shit sorted out and 2. He could've handled it better. They really need to train their customer service staff. Good thing the bad service ended there, thus, only a 1 star deduction (it would've been a 2 star deduction but I think the good points made up for this a little)

-The rooms (particularly the ones in the World Tower) are just not nice. To put it nicely, the rooms felt cheap and not high tech at all. You can be cool and hipster and rough around the edges if you are high tech and modern and up to date with the trends at least. But these were not. It felt like they really skimmed out making it feel like a luxurious hotel. The wallpaper felt cheap, there were manual blinds (not even automatic ones or blackout curtains). It wasn't horrible but I def wouldn't say it was nice. Just basic. Nothing special. 

Now onto things I DID like - 

-The food. Ohmygod, I could literally eat all my meals in this hotel and never leave. Which is actually what we really did. Lets face it, food in Vegas is disgusting. Food on the Strip especially. The ONLY good food I've ever had on the Strip was Joel Robuchon, but obviously, you're not always in the mood to spend $500-600 per person for a meal right? When that's the case, I suggest you come to the SLS. They have The Griddle Cafe (famous brunch place in LA), 800 degrees (built your own pizza, also from LA), Umami, Bazaar, Cleo (tapas) and Ku Noodles (chinese food) and Perq (the cooler hipster starbucks). Oh and the buffet. 

-Pool. Okay this is perhaps my FAV part apart from the food here. I LOVED that it DIDNT feel like a day club \/ big pool party like the rest of the pools in vegas. It was sexy and chic but also very very chill. I loved that! It was gorgeous, the foods and cocktails were mind blowingly amazing (get the appetizer sampler and the watermelon cocktail) and service was excellent! I could've spent all day there. 

-The casino. The casino is very very small, but that's what I liked abt it. It feels more like a hotel with a casino rather than a casino with a hotel if you know what I mean. I loved that! It was very hip and cool yet I found it attracted an older 30s crowd as opposed to young frat kids. That was a big plus. (Shit do I sound old?!)

-They made an effort to hire hotter younger waitresses at the casino floor and at the pool. What? It makes a difference. 

-Nice, clean, well equipped gym that you don't have to pay for!

Overall, this hotel def is very niche. It's not your usual high strung vegas experience. After all, it's pretty much off the strip. But if you want something DIFFERENT in a good way, this is the place to be",15,7,8

SLS had great service and an easy check-in check-out process. Very attentive customer service throughout the stay with quick responses to any immediate requests. The decor had a boutique vibe and the best mirrors for getting ready for a night on the town. The downside is the rooms are small with small beds. What we thought were full beds felt and looked like twin size beds. We were on a girls trip with 3 to a room and it felt a bit cramped. This would be a caution if you are intending to have several people in one room. Additionally the location itself was less than ideal as it was near the south end of the strip. Taking Uber\/Lyft (whichever you prefer) cost us anywhere from $20-$30 each way to get to and from our destinations that were more centrally located in the strip. Take note of this when booking your stay.  

Overall I had a good time and while I likely won't stay here again it's really about what your plans are when staying in Vegas.

(2) no spa tub, no tub whatsoever, only a shower. (Even motels have tubs.)
(3) no dresser or closet to organize your clothes. Instead, they penny pinched by placing a makeshift metal organizer with hangers for all to see your personal belongings. The makeshift organizer has 4 very small drawers, 2 of which are occupied with the safety box, the iron, & slippers. There are two robes & the ironing board all on one side of the open organizer, leaving no more than a foot & a half of space to hang clothes. It's a mess.
(4) no food court, a handful of scattered over priced restaurants, (none family friendly.) 
(5) you cannot move around the hotel freely, not sure what kind of people they attract, but they claim that for ""safety reasons"" you need your key card to go in & out of the pool area & the elevator area to access your room. So if you want to go to the pool & not carry anything with you, or go downstairs & say your partner stays in the room & you leave your key card, you become a prisoner of the lobby until someone can bring your keycard because you won't be allowed back into the elevator area to get to your room.
(6) the pool was disgustingly over chlorinated & they have loud scratchy music blasting in your ears. Very annoying. But, if you go to the pool, you cannot take the pool towels back to your room & simply have housekeeping recover them. They don't provide pool towels in your room either; hence, you will need to walk through the lobby back to your room, dripping wet. Add insult to injury, & you will have to experience temperature shock because it's hot in the pool area & then when you walk back into the hotel lobby it's freezing cold, all while dripping wet. However, they are not consistent in their policies because we went to the pool almost daily during our stay & on various occasions I saw plenty of people allowed to leave with the pool towels, when I addressed this with the staff I was simply told that it's an issue with security & pool staff. I then asked to speak to the shift manager, Carla, although she was professional, her approach to my inquiries & complaints, were a slap to the face because all she did is ""call"" someone & ask what the pool towel policy was. Really? This person WORKS as a SHIFT MANAGER at this hotel & does NOT know their own pool policy? When she reiterated that the policy is implemented by security & pool staff, I asked her who hires the security\/pool staff, she had no reply. All she did was offer me resort fee discount, I wasn't asking for a discount, I was asking to be allowed to wrap myself in a damn towel so I wouldn't be walking around the lobby dripping wet & freezing. What exactly are the resort fees for? Adding to their lack of consistency, on the first day we used the pool, the security said nothing about my fiancé walking out of the pool area without a shirt, yet the next day they told him he couldn't be shirtless. They worry about a man walking around shirtless, yet there are women walking around half naked. I don't get it.
(7) Very small pool area, with limited lounge chairs. You need to be there at pool opening to get a chair, or else they'll be no chairs left by noon. They have padded lounge chairs, sofas, & cabanas, but these are rent-only & not only are these over-priced, they are also very dirty and dingy.
(8) We asked for a non-smoking room, but it reeked of smoke, unbearable to breath.
(9) Loud AC that does not work, it would either be freezing cold, or unbearably hot, & no way to get it to adjust properly. At one point it started smelling like smoke, as if there was a short circuit. And then all of a sudden it would release a strong stench of cigarette. Horrible!
(10) No refrigerator for left-over food or to cool water, no microwave, & no coffee-pot. 
(11) dislike the zillion mirror maze look of the elevator area.
(12) NO LOCKS in the restroom. Yes, you heard me, no way to lock the restroom door for privacy while handling your personal business.
 
Overall,for the price & quality of this ""GHETTO-MOTEL,"" there are WAY BETTER options out there.",2,0,1

Feels like a cheap MOTEL with new wall papers.

To all the people who rated this hotel a 4\/5, I feel sorry for you... You must have never really stayed at a REAL hotel deserving of a 5 star, I forgive you... You don't know any better.

For everyone else who has ever stayed at a Real 4\/5 star such as: Venetian, Wynn, Encore, Cosmo, ETC... You get the point, BEWARE!  This is nowhere close to that.  

I just checked out this morning and couldn't wait for this trip to be over, due to the lack of quality from this hotel. 

DIRTY:
-SAHARA!  You can't buy a HOOKER a new dress and tell everyone she's a brand new person, she's still dirty.  This is exactly how I felt about this hotel.  It was just disgusting.

All the hallways reeked of cigarettes, even tho is was a ""NONE SMOKING"" floor.  Yes, I understand it's Vegas, it's typical, people smoke in the halls, this was different, it was like the smell was embedded into all the walls, floors, and rooms and you couldn't get rid of it.  I couldn't even sleep at night because of the horrible odor. 

-There were only two cups provided for the rooms, my boyfriend and I used it the first night, the next day, after the house keeper ""cleaned our room"", No new cups, just left our same old cups there (uncleaned) .  Not a big deal, but everywhere else replaces my cups, why can't u?

-Shampoo and soap were not replaced, we struggled to squeeze the last bit of everything 

-When we got there, There was still TRASH in the trash can from whoever stayed there previously...EW, disgusting.

HOTEL & ROOM ( world tower )

-The room
Is ridiculously SMALL!  We stayed at the world tower, the bed takes up the entire room, and one useless stupid couch in front of the bed.  Mirrors are place there to make the room ""SEEM"" bigger, trust me, nothing can make that room look bigger, SLS, you didn't fool us! 

No Dresser!  There is absolutely no dresser to store your clothes, so expect to live out of your bag, oh and the 6 hangers you get that comes along with the SMALL shoe closet.

Small Bathroom, it's a stand up shower, and the sink is not deep at all... So if you brought your own drinks and wanted to chill it in the sink?  Good luck, there is no way!  And there is NO FRIDGE!  Expect room temperature water when you wake up from a long night of drinking.
 
-The hallways are dark and creepy, and decor does not help!

$100 a night deposit HOLD, & $29 a night amenity fees.  Amenity?  HAHA!  You're all the way at the end of the strip, cab rides are expensive if your constantly riding into the strip!  There's very few selection of food, so, you're just have to starve, or pay 15-20$ to catch a cab to get food.

-Your View
This is Vegas!  We all want a view!  Our view was a rooftop, next to the parking lot.  And the window is tiny like an apartment window -_- JUST ONE window.

-Security 
I get it, luxury hotels like to have security stand at the elevator entrance and check room keys to make sure it's only hotel guest that have access to the rooms.  Stupid and pointless here, since the whole time staying here ( 4 nights) they only checked us 3 times, and half the time no one was even there, and when they were there, they were too busy on their phones, so you can just all pass them

Customer Service:
What a joke!

- Check in wasn't so bad, since we arrived early Thursday morning and there were no line.  But whenever I call the front desk, they are beyond RUDE!  One person didn't even great me, then she didn't  let me me finish my sentence before transferring me to the wrong department!  WTF?

- Checking Out
I called early this morning at 6:45 AM to check out, no one answered, I left the phone to ring on speaker while I do last minute  packing (15 minutes later) still no answer.  My boyfriend and I had to go manually check out, and there was only one person in line!  While the other two service desk girls were chit chatting away!

-Catching a cab, if there's a line (4 parties ahead of you) expect the wait to be 30 minutes.  Unlike the Wynn, when the lines get backed up, they call for more cabs, at SLS, the dumb valet guys just stand there and hopes a cab shows up.

- Monorail:  the hotel doesn't inform you on the things they have to offer that will make your stay more delightful, after three nights of cabbing, we discovered that the monorail was at the back of the SLS ( thanks to google) , and we could've saved so much money.

I can go on forever!  Sorry for the LONG rant, you can tell I am not a satisfied customer. 

Do yourself a favor, don't stay here.  This will ruin your Vegas experience!  It will not even feel like Vegas!",5,5,0

- Nice staff (with a few exceptions)
- Never a long wait in the valet; on the busiest night, there were four cars in line
- Cars also come pretty quickly at the valet, exception being Thursday evening when I think the guy who took our ticket was the only guy working because he eventually brought our car around.
- Good bars
- Modern, hip decor
- Almost-full sized shampoo, none of those dinky little ones that run out after 2 uses
- Clean rooms
- Good price

Cons
- A little further away from all the strip action
- Terrible, cheap toilet paper.  About one-step up from actual one-ply.  
- TINY rooms
- The nice restaurants we were hoping to hit up (Cleo, Bazaar Meat) were ""closed for the holidays"". 
- Slow internet
- The guys who chill out front in their nice wool coats just stand there and chat amongst themselves whereas at other places, they open doors for you.  Especially when your arms are full with stuff.
- They charge a resort fee that's not reduced to account for pools closing in the winter.

All in all, we had a nice stay.  But probably not going to give it another go unless we were low on options.",6,1,1

After all of the hype and anticipation, I was hoping to be overwhelmed and expected much more.  If you've been in the old Sahara you can tell they didn't do much except paint over the old paint and rearrange slot machines.  It feels like it was cheaply redone.  Being there on opening night, the entire place should be spotless.  The carpet needed to be vacuumed and the whole design is very claustrophobic.  If you are trying to attract people to that end of the strip, it needs to be as beautiful and nice as a casino such as Cosmopolitan and it certainly is not.

The parking is a disaster and after we finally found one, the elevator didn't even work.  

Went into Foxtail and the DJ was good, but there wasn't much of a crowd (opening night!?!) and nothing about it made me want to come back.  The monkey bar was nice, but we sat down and ordered drinks and waited for quite some time and ended up cancelling our order and leaving before they came.  

I really was expecting more and was excited to bring out of town guests to a new casino on its grand opening.  Everyone was very underwhelmed and had no desire to spend anymore time at SLS.  We will not be going back anytime soon.",17,3,0

Star with the pros and cons:

Pros:
Calm - not too crowded
Clean - casino doesn't smell like an ashtray 
Very accommodating - staff was wonderful everyone from registration to security was attentive and accommodating.
The Perq coffee- is definitely one of the perks of SLS. If you're a coffee lover like I am you will enjoy some of the best coffee I've ever tasted.
The suites are sweet! - stayed at the Lux Tower - Lux signature king corner suite. It was about 690 sq feet, very spacious, clean and cool.
Monorail - yes you'll see a con is that it's off the strip but its got a monorail that will get you to the strip in a couple minutes for $12 for the day.
Restaurants - the Perq , katsuya, 800 degrees, and umami were all hits.

Cons:
Off the strip - if you want to be in the heart of the strip and experience the madness this isn't the hotel for you.
Casino - casino was smaller than the big name casinos on the strip.
North side cafe- the breakfast was bland. Sls really needs a good breakfast cafe. I tried the omelet and the BBQ chicken salad and both were under par with other cafes found in Vegas hotels.

Over all I give this hotel and the experience a 5 star rating. I would totally stay here again. I've heard mixed reviews regarding hotel room sizes and amenities - but like I said I stayed at the lux signature King suite and I loved the room. I'd like to give a special shout out to Jovanni at the registration desk who was incredibly patient when I was trying to decide on a room and very attentive. He really made my SLS experience a great one. 

In summary, if you want a clean, calm, off the strip, boutique hotel & casino... SLS should definitely be considered. If you're an SPG member you get the added benefit of getting reward points, free in room waters and such, which can add up!",5,0,1

Pros:
1.  Convenience - You don't have to leave this hotel for much of anything.  They have a concert hall, several restaurants, a nightclub, a bar, a spa, a pool and stores.  
2.  Room - Small but doable, and I loved the mirrors.  I never knew that I was would love having mirrors on every wall of my room, but I loved my room at SLS.  
3.  Security - I liked that someone was checking that people who entered the World Tower had a room key.  That made sure not many randos made it upstairs. 
4.  Fire Drill protocol - Some dimwits were smoking like crazy and set off a fire alarm.  The hotel fire alarm went off and some of us left the building but it wasn't a hectic scene and the security personnel handled it fairly well.  
5.  Shuttle - Complimentary shuttle service to the Airport and other areas like downtown.
6.  Monorail - An entrance is right outside the back entrance.  Handy, huh?  

Cons:
1.  The Look (or lack thereof) - I can't say what the vibe of this hotel is supposed to be.  The outside doesn't give a hint of the inside and the inside is so odd with the entrance floors that light up leading to a carpet that I cannot describe in its ugliness; I should have taken a picture.  But the casino itself doesn't seem to have a theme other than ""dark."" It is not a brightly lit casino with fake blue sky ceiling.  
2.  Front Desk - A lot of young people work here and they spend more time talking and laughing with each other than actually working.  They'll get it done but be prepared to wait a minute while they laugh at Facebook posts.  

Pro\/Con depending on how you look at it:
1. Cameras - Lots and lots of cameras.  Lots of cameras are the norm in casinos but there are cameras all over the place at SLS.  I think other casinos may hide them better but the ceilings at SLS don't allow for that, so you see all of them in their creepy glory.  

Overall, my stay at SLS was good, and I would stay here again.

First impression was a half an hour wait to check in on the Friday evening of Memorial Day weekend...when over half the front desk is unmanned! Second impression were the abnormal slow elevators; these clearly are not up to their task in this hotel. During our stay we got to meet someone who runs hotels and who clearly worded what we were seeing. The staff seems ill trained and appears to think the guests are there for them where in reality they are there for the guests. Staff at the Foxtail pool is the exception though.
That brings me to the pools... There are two pools; the party pool (Foxtail) and the family pool (Lux). The Foxtail pool is nice but has only paid beds and cabanas. The Lux pool is tiny and you are lucky when you can get one of the free beds. You are basically forced to go to Foxtail.
The rooms are ok. Nice are the Bluetooth alarm clocks (serve as a speaker for your phone) and big screen TV. The bed is comfy. There are two huge mirrors in the room that you'll love when you like to dress-up etc. Did I already say that you should not be in a hurry with their elevators? So annoying! There is a gym that is ok equipped. Better than most regular hotels when not in Vegas. In Vegas though it is too small. The hotel is away from the Strip. The Las Vegas monorail has a station in front of the hotel which is convenient ($5 one way or $12 for 24h). A taxi to the Strip will cost you between $12 and $20 (one way), depending on traffic. I doubted giving the hotel 3 stars but I just can't. Next time we'll pay more but have a better stay at the Aria.

First off, their decor is ON POINT. I love the style of everything in this hotel from their rooms to their pool and casino. BUT the quality of everything is so cheapy looking. It's like building a million dollar room...with Target or Wal-mart brand products. It does the job but if you look closely...it doesn't really cut it. That's just me being picky but you don't see Bellagio or Wynn half-assing their stuff. The service at the front desks are not as nice as I expected either. At the end of check in they tell you that they charge $300 per night as deposits just in case there are damages to the room...She said it so fast it was like those infomercials at the end that say things so fast they want you to miss it. When hearing this I asked her to say it once more so I know what's going on...she totally gave me huge attitude as if I'm already suppose to know this. Like excuse me....

Oh and there are no ice machines in the hotel. You would think all the money you pay for this new and upcoming place...they would also have ice machines? It's such a hassle having to call down to request for ICE. And its not the quickest service either. You pretty much get ready for the club...want to pregame but wait...there's still no ice. And then you gotta repeat that every night cause ice MELTS. Duh. Oh and they'll charge after you request it twice so just do it once a night to save money people.

We tried to communicate with her to see if there's another way to work out this problem, but the lady just told us there's nothing she could do.

I wished I could give them a better rating as a newly opened hotel, but they're really far from a 4 stars hotel. I've stayed at a handful of hotels in Vegas and I'm sure SLS is no where near the other 4 stars rated hotels.

First, their parking structure elevator did not work the whole weekend while we were there. How could they not fix the issue at all? How do those with wheel chair get to the hotel from parking structure? We had a stroller so we would walked down all the levels in the parking garage and cross the road where people are entering to the structure. It was not the safest route to take but we had no choice. We definitely did not want to carry the stroller down flights of stairs in this heat!

Second, registration was so disorganized. There's no lines so people were randomly standing and the person behind the counter would call the next person who nearly just walked up while the rest of us have been waiting in line for 15 minutes. 

Third, our room had hair here and there around the bathroom and bed...did they even clean the room or change the sheets? gross! Even the drinking glass had things on it from the previous guests since they forgot to replace the glass with clean ones.

Lastly, ...and this was a huge one for me. I'm traveling with my baby and needed my ice packs in the freezer so I have it ready on the day I go home. I called front desk, bell desk and concierge and every person either, don't know how to help me, told me they can't do it or told me they'd call me back with an answer...which none of them called me back. This is the first hotel I've stayed at that does not offer this service. Those that knows me, knows I travel to Vegas and stay at hotels often and I travel for work around the country so I've stayed at countless numbers of hotels and this is the first hotel that told me they can't freeze ice packs for me. Serious?? I wasn't going to have my baby's milk get spoiled so of course had to improvise and hassle other friends for their help.

Would I stay at SLS again? Probably not if I have a choice.",4,1,0

Pros:
-nice front desk staff
-a lot of young hip ""cosmopolitan-ish"" crowd, meaning eye candy
-cool pool with decent ""open seating"" on the lounge chairs
-refurbished rooms from the old Sahara hotel, very modern-retro-chic with a lot of white colors
-decent amount of restaurants for size of hotel\/casino, all I believe have outpost in SoCal
-new(redone) hotel that isn't saturated with years of smoke
-center bar has huge led screen almost like a mini Fremont street experience over the center bar

Con's:
-drink prices are crazy high! Pool charges $9 for a beer and inside at bars charge $8. Signature drinks at pool start at $18 and inside the hotel they start at $14! Where am I in Spearmint rhino?
-some staff can be missing out on guest satisfaction\/experience
-rooms are small compared to say the Wynn, Cesar's, Cosmopolitan etc...
-rooms have thin walls
-room interactive TV\/guest information needs more information about hotel and facilities
-small spa facilities, no jacuzzi\/hot tub, only a steam room and you can only use that if your getting a spa treatment (not included in resort fee)
-rooftop pool only open on the weekends
-don't walk around away from property late night

I'm sure the hotel will work some of it's kinks out and hopefully the empty lot across Las Vegas Blvd gets a property built there soon because there is a need for more hotels businesses in the immediate area.",4,2,2

We shopped in Etc and had some of the pistachio cherry gelato and coffees in Perq coffee shop. I bought a signature monkey hoodie that is soft and warm- perfect for my trip to Wisconsin in a few days. Signature bedslippers are on sale for $6.99 so we got these too!

The larger pool where the pool parties are is gorg but hotel guest don't have special privileges as far as automatic access or no waiting in line where there is an event. Which is super annoying!

The casino layout is just old and doesn't even make you want to gamble there. Overall just very poorly done. Customer service isn't the greatest. The only positive is there options of food. Katsuya, Cleo and Umami are my favs. They make you wait over 30 minutes even though there are plenty of seats open. Makes sense now why the room rates are so cheap.

The hotel has nothing to do with the famed household name that SLS holds in Los Angeles. Nothing prestigious or Las Vegas-ish about this hotel. The rooms are ridiculously small, toilets have sewage smell that travels throughout the room, the restaurants are beyond horrible. 

The restaurant Cleo, in particular, was disgusting. The food was distasteful, flavorless, and smokey.

The pools are trashy and no room to seat. They've put approximately 50 beds and the rest are cabanas and reserved seating with minimums. In the middle of the summer, only 2-3 cabanas (out of 30) and 5 out of 50 reserved beds were being used. This hotel does not understand how to serve clientele and to meet the demands of people who just want to lay out and enjoy the music.

The upper deck pool on the the 3rd floor of the hotel was an outside mess with kids running around splashing everyone. Music volume was set to almost reading appropriate level. 

The feel of the hotel isn't even a resort, it's like a fancy holiday inn. Nothing impressive at all. If you're traveling to Las Vegas, stay in one of the iconic hotels in more of a prime location on the strip. It's worth the extra money. We wanted to try this hotel out as we were from LA and appreciate the Los Angeles location.

Was very excited to see what the new hotel would be like but was not very impressed. When we arrived friday the hotel was empty so check in was quick and easy. I had booked through an email they had sent me for a free high floor upgrade which wasn't applied to our room. The room itself was clean and the decor in the world tower is cute but very girly. The rooms are very small and reminded me of an upgraded dorm room. Anytime we would try to call the front desk we would be on hold for 30 minutes and would end up giving up. There is no actual room service through the hotel, but a couple of the restaurants like Umami Burger and 800 Degrees will deliver to the rooms. The only frustrating thing about this was that none of them were open for breakfast or very late. The valet was very slow and we almost missed a dinner reservation because we had to wait for our car so long. However there was never a cab line, and it is nice that to get up to the main part of the strip you can take the freeway instead of dealing with the traffic on the strip. It is still about a $25 ride to get down to the MGM. There is a monorail stop at the hotel which was quick, easy, and probably a better deal then taking cabs. The pools are nothing to write home about. We thought for a holiday weekend Beach LiFE would be more of a pool party but was empty with an older crowd. The Foxtail pool is nice but small and quiet. Overall I probably wouldn't stay here again because of the size and location but would definitely head there for dinner and to go to LiFE and Foxtail nightclubs again.",1,0,0

I booked this trip on Vegas.com and wasn't to thrilled of staying here due to the reviews on Yelp.  It was a quick weekend family trip to Vegas with the hubby and toddler and it was perfect for us:  away from the strip, less crowded, good restaurants, and service was pretty cool too. We enjoyed ourselves at the pool - I like how there are those lawn chairs are placed right on the 10 inch deep poolside.  It was great for our two year old to wade in the pool while we are relaxing.  Just come exactly at 10am when the pool opens so that you can get some good seats.  

Had breakfast at Northside cafe- our own server was kinda slow but the manager and bus boys got his back by helping us out.  We also ate at the noodle place- lo mein was good and the noodle soup that my hubby had was OK.

Room was comfy but I wished they had a tub! Wifi was kick ass in our room.  We were able to download a movie on the iPad in like 5 minutes lol!  Bed was nice and fluffy and we all slept like babies!!  It's a bit small but if you're going to be out most of the time then it shouldn't matter. Oh and they don't have Disney or nickelodeon LOL! But other than that we liked the room.  

We just took the monorail to check out the other side of the strip. One full day at the strip was all that we needed.  We were kindsa relieved to get back to sls and away from the hustle and bustle.  Sls just felt more cleaner and sleek compare to the other hotels on the strip.

Once in October in the World Tower and this past weekend in the Story Tower. We really enjoy this hotel. It has great decor in my opinion and I love the industrial style with splash of color. The world tower is slightly larger then the story I think, however we prefer the story because it had more character and better views. You could actually look out the window and we saw the stratosphere lit up. It also has a couch and bed light up to a glow which was pretty neat.

The food options: North side is ok for breakfast only. We didn't enjoy their dinner menu to much. Katsuya on the other hand is AMAZING. I cannot even describe the culinary experience we had the food is so tasty and beautifully  presented. It is a must! We had 3 appetizers and two entrées we were so full but it was that good we had to try as much as we could.

The casino and pool are nice, not too crowded but a little on the smaller side. The casino doesn't have a huge floor like most. The pool is one large one split between a bar it's nice but small and nothing special. They do not have a hot tub. 

The service we receive is always good they are friendly professional and easy to work with. If you have an issue or need something just ask. 

We missed having a hot tub and a good cheap spot for late eats but all in all we enjoyed yet another stay and it's the last stop on the monorail can't beat that! We are looking forward to trying out their last room the Luxe.

Lastly, when we checked in they didn't realize it was my birthday but when we went to the code area to get a players card the awesome and friendly cashier Eric was great and asked if we knew what they offer, he let us know about their birthday specials!

I believe this will be the first step of revitalizing this part of Vegas and the SLS will be an iconic reason why. Overall I give this hotel a 4 star review. 

If you are looking for a trendy, modern, hotel with a young crowd this is the place. The hotel is decorated with mirrors everywhere, trendy wall paper, and almost over the top decorations. If you have stayed at The W hotel brand or another SLS you'll understand what it means to be uber trendy.

Here are my only comments on areas that need more attention:

The world tower is probably the least updated of all. The elevators are still the original elevators for the Sahara. They are painstakingly slow. Like, you turn another year older slow. since they tend to be so slow, they overcrowd often you have to wait for minutes for another one. Also, the monorail that's right outside seems to have significant issues with their service. Also, if you're one who tends to not like younger, millennial, this may not be the right hotel for you. They are EVERYWHERE. 

Cool: You can checkout from your hotel TV screen. No need to wait inline. 

All the hotel restaurants are really good. A bit overpriced but very good and convenient since they are onsite.  

Overall, I recommend this hotel for a younger crowd and for a great priced option that's in the quieter part of town. Stay here, help the North Strip revitalize. You'll be happy once you do!",0,1,0

I arrived just prior to the check in time of 3:00pm and there was a large group of guests waiting to check in.  Thankfully, the front desk was fully staffed, which kept the lines moving, albeit at a slow pace.  The rep I worked with was efficient and thoroughly explained the amenities available and I was on my way to the World Tower.  I knew what I was getting into room-wise, so I wasn't surprised to see that the rooms were a bit smaller than a standard Las Vegas hotel room.  The room was extremely clean and smelled fresh, much like the rest of the lobby and common areas.  The bathroom was also extremely clean and fully stocked with amenities from the Ciel Spa located in the hotel.  

As I settled in, I noticed that the wi-fi that's paid for with the resort fee was going in and out.  I was at the end of a hallway, so I assume this was the reason.  I mentioned it to the front desk rep at check out, but as the room was comped, it was more for informational purposes.  He said they'd let their engineers know and that a repeater may need to be adjusted or reset.  If you're staying here for the wi-fi....look elsewhere.

I gambled a bit in the casino and ended up a little bit, so I'm happy about that.  I didn't eat on property this time, but I have had great experiences at The Griddle, The Buffet at SLS (when it was still open) and Perq (even though it is super pricey.)

My room was located on the 19 floor, modern & Chic and the usage of border lit mirrors opened the room up. The bed was comfy and the bathroom contained  a shower that was glass enclosed with a high pressure rain forrest shower head. The room also had a safe for valuables and a fully stocked bar & snacks.

All of the three times were solid and convenient.  The hotel spa contains an adequate fitness center and is open 24 hours to work off all those excess calories you're bound to indulge in.

There's also free self parking, which is a rare thing at a LV hotel\/casino these days.

This is a SPG hotel, so if you're a points person, you can start squealing with glee when you check in. Several food and beverage options await, all are very easy to find. Umami Burger, Beergarden, Bazaar Meat, Cleo, even the The Perq are all very accessible. No wandering around the casino necessary, unless you get a kick out of that sort of think Also, there's a swanky pool on the first floor. Bonus!

My room was clean and plenty spacious for a 3-night stay. Large TV with cable, though no Bravo, so I missed my regular Monday night dose of Vanderpump. Ah well, no one comes to Las Vegas to watch TV anyway...

We visited all of the restaurants in the hotel, with the exception of the Jose Andres option.  The food, price, and service were excellent.  Katsuya was my favorite of the options, and the food was fantastic. 

We also went to LiFE, on Saturday night, and with the exception of the music being too loud (or just me being to old for nightclubs), it was amazing!

There is a monorail station right outside of the casino that traverses the entire Strip, so the location should never be a concern.

The slick pictures online give the impression of a hip vibe like the Cosmopolitan, but the people are unpleasant, the location is sketchy, and a coat of paint on dingy old rooms doesn't go nearly far enough. It's no wonder the hotel is failing so miserably. A few specifics:

1. The airport shuttle is a joke. The hotel claims pickups every 30 minutes. Expect 90 minutes, and don't bother calling the hotel or shuttle company (ODS) because they will give you attitude. When (if?) it arrives, the unpleasant driver will scream at you, blow her cigarette in your face, drive like a maniac, then scream again when no one (I can't imagine why) tips her.

2. The front desk attendant didn't care about #1. Let me understand this--a guest checking in has *already* had a bad experience at your property and you don't offer a room upgrade or even a cocktail for their troubles? That's unthinkable at any respectable Vegas hotel.

3. The resort fee covers wifi. One minor catch: there is no signal. Awesome.

4. The room had cheap plastic venetian blinds--circa 1985--and smelled old and musty. And there must have been a leak on the floor (World Tower 11th) because the entire floor smelled like mildew, and there were giant loud blowers drying the hallway. Why would you even *put* guests on that floor?

5. It's in the middle of *nowhere* and the neighborhood is sketch. Even if you can book this place for cheaper than a strip hotel, you'll spend an inordinate amount of time and money on transportation to the places you *actually* want to be.

6. If you decide to use Über or Lyft, the guys working the valet\/driveway\/taxi stand will give the driver static and tell them not to come back. Obviously they're in cahoots with the taxi monopoly and don't care about what the *guests* want for transportation options.

Look, I usually try to write balanced reviews--the good and the bad--but I literally can't think of one good thing to say about SLS. Take my advice: don't waste your trip in this dive.",1,0,0

They have a Walgreens right around the corner that has liquor and also a huge souvenir place across the street that also has booze and anything you might need...both were similar in price for booze.

We had booked a Lux double suite (pool view) and a Lux king room. 2 world tower rooms. Front desk said rooms were not ready and to come back at 3. At 3 rooms were still not ready. Came back at 3:45p and rooms were still not ready. We had 5:00 reservations for dinner so we needed to get in our rooms to get ready. The manager Kendell or Ken that I spoke to was incredibly rude. His exact words were check in is not ""necessarily"" at 3p it depends on the room. Since we had paid for a pool view room it would not be ready for another 2 hours. So I had to take the non pool view room because we could not wait 2 hours. He took $25 (big whoop) off our room. Our entire group total had 8 different rooms booked at this hotel. We will never come back. To top things off the 2 world tower rooms I booked I told the clerk at check in to charge our friends cards instead of mine and they messed up and still left the charges on my card at checkout.

I just had to book the hotel, we saw a GREAT deal on Travelzoo for SLS. It stated you would be in an upgraded LUX Suite with wonderful amenities and two drinks free for every night stay. The deal was so good that when I called to confirm the deal the SLS Customer service did not even hear of this deal yet when I purchased it. Plus the hotel was booked solid the weekend we picked because of a big marathon. 

I should have known things would go downhill the moment we waited about 45 minutes for our shuttle at the airport that was only supposed to be a 10 minute wait. We called the hotel twice to make sure the shuttle was coming as it was the last stop of the night, they informed us a few minutes because he was dropping folks off at another terminal so we said ok and they didn't show up for another half hour. SIGH..

We get to the hotel roughly between 8pm and 9pm and when I got there was told that since the hotel was ""sold out"" and we were checking in late that they did not have any non smoking rooms available and only a smoking room. My husband gets a severe sinus infection when he is around the ""smoke"" smell for too long. So we said we really need a non smoking room and they ""Assured"" us that the room does not smell like smoke and that they deodorize the room. we accepted and went up to our ""lux suite"". The room smelled horrible, the wallpaper in the bedroom was made of cloth so the smoke smell was just overwhelming. We immediately called the front desk and said we need to switch rooms and that it was not good for us to be there. they told us to leave the room for an hour and they would  deodorize the room again. We left and came back and it was horrible, we begged to be in another room even if it was a downgraded room we didn't care we needed to get out of there. They were very unaccommodating and said we had to stay in this room until the morning when they would be able to help us. 

Needless to say my husband and I stayed out all night to avoid the horrible situation we were forced to be in. we came back and slept in the room, we woke up and called the exact time they told us to all and they said "" we have a room on hold for you but it's not clean we will call you when it's ready"" Oh vey! ok so we got ready and an hour and half later we called again, and their response"" it's still not ready so you will have to wait"" and we said we are not waiting in our room all day for you this was supposed to be done in an hour and what are we supposed to do wait in the hotel and not leave until you have 1 room clean? 

You would think they would be more accommodating to us since we had such an issue, they did offer us a $50 credit voucher for food, but this running around and waiting was very inconsiderate. We just said we cannot wait, and we went down to the front desk and spoke to someone and the moment we said anything she said oh I have a room it's ready here you go, WHAT!!  The lady at the front desk was very helpful but really why were we just told nothing was ready for us 2 minutes ago now all of a sudden they have a room? 

After this incident everything was ok, we decided to play at the SLS Casino as well and we played for well over an hour lost money but what made us more mad was that during that hour or so not ONE waitress came over to ask for a drink, the pit boss even said he was going to get someone for us and that never happened. I found one waitress and she said oh this isn't my area i'll get your waitress..never did. 

Overall the food we ate at Umami Burger and Northside Café was very good. We especially enjoyed the cocktails at Umami Burger they were fantastic! 

I would not stay here again, it really made us feel disappointed. I work in Customer service and I try not to make a scene or be angry because I know they go thru a lot but if someone was somewhat nice it would have made the difference, the girl at the front desk was the only one. I wish I caught her name. She was fantastic and they all should take lessons on Customer service from her.",7,2,1

I was in town for 3 weeks for various expo events. My girlfriend decided to visit me over Halloween weekend. We stayed at Mandalay Bay on Friday and the SLS Saturday. Our experience at Mandalay was great as always but for some reason rates were insane for the night after Halloween, not the actual holiday. I was able to book a ""suite"" at the SLS for the cost of a king at Mandalay. SLS is at the Northernmost part of the strip. Casino enters from Las Vegas blvd. and main entrance is in the back off of Paradise. Past Circus Circus, Riviera and opposite Stratosphere. SLS is the old Sahara property. It is not walking distance from anything other than the Convention Center and Westgate (Las Vegas Hilton).

Check in:
Valet is a mess. Half of the garage is for valet and the other is for self park. But there are 2 valet in and 1valet out with no one directing traffic or telling other vehicles how far to move. Valet pick up area is narrow and awkward. Two benches and the area is cluttered with trash cans. Obnoxious if there is 15+ people waiting for their cars. There are several guest registration desks with dividers to funnel the guests to their respective counter. It didn't happen to me but I noticed a few times that the staff wouldn't immediately take the next person in their line. Rather, they'd take the next person from any of the lines that they thought was waiting the longest. It was frustrating to those next in their line. This is a poor system because it irritates guests and levies no accountability for the employees to work at a more efficient pace. But we were registered in a timely manner.

Room:
Rate was reasonable for a ""suite."" This will probably change after they've promoted for a bit. Bathroom is nice; dual head shower was relaxing and the bath products were fantastic. Lots of storage space and private restroom. The 60"" TV was nice and their cable system is better than most. But as far as the living space? Meh. Standard King rooms at Mandalay, Cosmo and PH are all just as large without the suite premium. 

Hotel:
Plenty to do. I didn't feel like I overpaid for anything at Perq, the coffee house or Monkey Bar. The noodle place looked good and there are the obligatory designer shops that all of the new Vegas resorts want to shove down our throats. I like the design of the elevators and the concept of different themed rooms for each of the three towers is pretty cool. We were in the Lux tower. 
The whole place smells like new carpet and laminating chemicals though. That goes for the hallways leading to the rooms, the main lobby, the upper level with the buffet. I liked the FedEx center that is open to hotel guests 24\/7. The gym is excellent. I was very impressed. Brand new equipment, very clean, fresh ice water. The buffet is great but that's a separate review. The hotel uses the old Sahara infrastructure though. Nothing was done to repurpose the square footage. Some areas of the hotel feel cluttered and others feel barren. The upper lobby is just the buffet and FedEx center. Talk about wasted space. They have someone at the escalator to signal the buffet is upstairs and that no, you're not lost. And the old red branded Sahara carpet is still everywhere in the lobby and casino. 

The casino:
I actually really like the casino theme. The lighting is perfect and contrasts the bright lights of the slots exceptionally well. They have a wide variety of games but a modest quantity. They've moved away from the worn out video poker and diamond style slots and have more of the engaging arcade style. Obviously trying to appeal to a younger crowd. The table dealers are all dressed in suits cohering to the hotel scheme. 

The BAD:
The gym and spa share the same level in the Lux tower. We had our workout and walked in the restroom to clean up. Went into the steam room for one minute and a spa employee comes and rips me out yelling how it was for spa customers only. Most gyms have steam rooms so how am I to know? It's patronizing to the person and frustrating to the people paying the $ being disturbed.
The nail in the coffin for me was the sports book. What a F'ing disaster. This is where management really needs to take notice. We checked out and rushed downstairs to place bets before Kickoff. I shell out $1000 on bets. I try to sit and see that every table has a reserved tag. I ask the host and she says there is a $50 food\/drink minimum for 3 hours and another $50 for the next 3 hours. $100 just to watch even though I have bets? I ask her about comp drinks and she looks at me like I'm crazy. $1000 to the house and no comp drinks? Inexcusable. For that reason alone I'll never stay here again until they figure that out. Don't force a restaurant on betters. With Westgate across the street, best sports book in town, be on notice. You're hemorrhaging money treating your players like that when a better product is 5 minutes away.",5,2,1

It's always nice to feel like you're actually getting better service in the dedicated loyalty line.

Pros - 
- Quality amenities including toiletries, slippers, comfy robes
- Good dining options - I really enjoyed the happy hour at Katsuya. The cocktails I had at the Monkey Bar and Center Bar were really well made.
- Not a zoo. For me this is a pro since I don't care for the crowds in some of the more central hotels.
- New, attractive design - this is a matter of taste but I prefer the general ambience of the SLS to some of the older, more ""classic"" Vegas hotels I've stayed in
- Resort fee includes airport shuttle
- Free water for SPG members (saved us a few trips to Walgreens)

Cons -
- A bit far from the strip. In warm weather, I imagine this would be less of a problem. We rented a car so it was a nonissue. It's also mitigated by the monorail but the monorail, IMO, is expensive.

We got a groupon for the weekend and it comes with some drinks but we never got them--will talk to front desk later. The concierge room was cool with frosted glasses and lovely furniture. Our room was in the story tower; think New York loft. The rooms are TINY. The bed frame is plastic and faces the window and the couch. There's a mirror on the ceiling--which is AWFUL. And the doors, which slide in front of the toilet, sink and shower, are also mirror. The shower stall and the toilet stall are yellow and bright. It reminds me of a deconstructed taxi. 

In the middle of the night, you can hear everything happening outside the room--people talking sound like they are in your room. 

Our room face the Stratosphere, which was cool. I think for the price of the groupon, SLS was just fine but I don't think I'd buy normal prices unless I was going to be in another tower. This one is just not my style.

The hotel rooms are cute, the beds are insanely comfortable and the pillows are legit the best pillows I've ever slept on ever! The new club LiFE at SLS is cool, they book good DJs and the underground Sunday's are amazing. 

However, the location itself is pretty far from everything. The rooms are just as expensive as say the cosmo or the bellagio which are much more central. The customer service is terrible!! You can't even check out without being put on hold for 10+ minutes! 

This place isn't bad but it's not the best. In my opinion, nothing will ever compare to some of the other more established hotels in Vegas. Id say stick to what you know and stay at the Cosmopolitan, Wynn, Bellagio if you want something luxe.",4,1,1

Ultimately, I like that they have nice restaurants in the casino area, and their attempt to have a modern twist in their rooms that really separate out their look from other hotels on the strip but the bedframe was made of plastic that you can see the wear on when you turn on the lights. 

Probably would not be back, the yellow theme in their restroom really throws me off.",5,4,2

- Sketchy looking area of the strip. Lots of construction.
- Right when we walked in from the parking garage it smelled like perfume trying to cover up cigarette smell. Ew.
- Thank you front desk man for checking us in 4 hours early.
- Perq's coffee is gross and overpriced.
- parking garage a little confusing
- free shuttle to and from airport

Room #32619 review:
Pros: 
- it was free (paid for by work)
- plenty of outlets and USB ports
- ginormous tv, free wifi
- late check out
- it was free

Cons: 
- SMALL!
- if you get a room with two beds, they will be doubles and not queens.
- ""curtains"" don't black out the room
- no mini fridge, coffee maker
- check out on tv feature not working",1,1,1

First of all, if you're staying here for a trade show? Amazing. It's better than staying at the Marriott, Westgate or some smaller hotel since the idea is to sometimes save $$. You're staying in a pretty cool place comparably. 

If you're staying here for pleasure? I'm afraid I'll have to say 'look elsewhere'. There is a whole strange vibe about the place now that wasn't there before. The first time I went was for business so I could care less. Get me a room so I can rest, that's it. When you're there to relax with your significant other, you notice a whole other side of the SLS. From the ghetto locals clogging up the hallways to the prostitution (yep) to the 'security', I would not recommend this place. You'll have your hand on your wallet the entire time. 

Housekeeping is also a joke. From the 'hair' on our sheets to the stains on the towels. Who knows what either of them were but if you do stay here? Inspect the room THOROUGHLY. I would have complained but it was 2AM when we got in so ... there's that. 

I do have to say however, the restaurants? Great choices, they're clean and they have some great food even if you just got into town at 2AM, you'll be able to get a good meal.",4,2,2

CONS: there are plenty
1. its not too far from the strip ( or so you think ) until you take a cab. we spent 80$ our first day. $20 to get to the strip In the morning , 20$ to get back to the room in the afternoon 20$ to head to the club and 20$ to get back.

2. There were no drawers to away your belongings!!! I am a GIRL I took every outfit possible that I could fit in my duffle bag.  What the heck!! that is ridiculous a tiny closet space with only 5 hangers? tell me how that makes sense? w\/ only one shelf! There is two of us for 3 days! I still cant get over the no storage room for your belongings. I just left all my clothes in my duffle bag the whole weekend. That does not make you feel like your staying in a nice hotel. And it was a hassel to dig for clothes every morning and every night.

3. There is no venting fan in the restroom...........  if your staying with your boyfriend be prepared ladies..... seriously. horrible.

My room was always super clean and had everything I needed. The cafe's and restaurants at this resort are very reasonable in price for great quality food. I had a chance to visit both pools, the party one downstairs and the family pool on the 3rd floor. I personally enjoyed my day at the family pool more, but that's probably because I was already tired from all the partying I did outside of the resort. The security guard, Ethan that previously worked at the family pool during my stay made a lot of suggestions and places for me to visit. I really appreciated it because I was traveling alone in Vegas on my last few days there. Every staff member at this resort was very helpful with anything I needed during my whole stay.

This hotel claim was claimed to be on the strip, but it's actually way away from any hot spots. You're going to be next to the stratosphere which is apparently next to the ghetto. My girlfriend family booked the hotel since it had high ratings. However, I would of spent my own money for the holidays just to stay away from this place. My girlfriend went to check in and she called me asking to look for a new hotel. The check-in lady stated, after my girlfriend asked if the rooms were any bigger, that ""this is a boutique hotel, so what do you expect?"" The garage was closed due to construction and I had to keep in pull into the hotel just so I could stay close while she was attempting to check in.

Now I'm going to begin this review by saying that I work for a Fortune 100 Global Travel Services company and I travel for work but I also travel a ton for leisure. 

I grew up in Las Vegas but moved to Arizona many years ago but visit Las Vegas about 2-3 times per year, normally staying at Caesars, Wynn or Palazzo. MGM Grand and Aria are tremendous as well. 

I want to say that if this hotel is trying to get a 5 Diamond Award (which is what every luxury Las Vegas resort strives for) you are far, far away from receiving 1 Diamond. 

So I'm going explain some very simple concepts for Management to read and understand. I've seen all this before in Las Vegas. Outside Hotel companies think that because they are successful in LA, Miami, NYC or globally that they can just show up, put a little paint on an older run down frame of a long lost casino (The Sahara), slap their sign up and people will just come in a love the place they will ""set a new standard of Luxury in Las Vegas"". Only to find themselves crash and burn. 

When you come to Las Vegas, and build a property on the strip that touts luxury you better do your homework on Las Vegas and be ready to compete with the masters of the game, Steve Wynn, MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainment and Sheldon Adelson. 

This resort highly misses the mark and my stay was atrocious at best. 

Let's lay out the highs (not many) and lows (many) of my stay at this ""monkey palace""

Good:

Soft Bed
Unique Rooms
Modern Electronics
Nice Bathroom fixtures
Staff at Bazaar Meats

The Bad:

I showed up to Valet only to be greeted by a guy who walked to my car, opened the door, didn't say ""Welcome to the SLS"" nor did he ask me for my name or if I was even staying in the hotel or just visiting. Next he proceeded to tell me ""You sure you want to park in this valet, we have one in the back too"" as if to prompt me to not inconvenience his night by having him park my car. 

Upon entry into the casino there was next to no excitement, dark lighting and a very empty casino floor. The inside was too dark and the casino ceiling is too low and drab featuring ventilation pipes and steel bars reminiscent of shopping at CostCo. 

Hotel Registration\/Lobby way in the back amidst a dark corner next to a bar featuring a semi racist monkey theme.

Casino Employees seem lethargic and having pure remorse for leaving their previous job to join a new strip hotel, which in the past is a boon for Vegas employees. 

It was my birthday and I planned on having car service take my wife and I to dinner at Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse, then to MGM for KA. I was told by the Concierge that they didnt have car service and it was a 3rd party vendor whom charged by the hour. 

I'm a $1,000\/hand player at minimum so this was an insult. The Wynn and Palazzo give me car service whenever I'm in town. No High-End Luxury resort in Vegas uses a 3rd party car service because they have their own fleet of cars. 

The Casino Floor was empty and drab on a weekend. No incentive for me to pull money from my account and begin playing here. 

Went up to my room only to find that the elevators this hotel uses are the same one's from the 1970's used by the Sahara which was formerly in this spot. Terrible! 

The clientele. 5 star and 5 Diamond resorts have elite, exclusive clientele. This clientele was for Circus Circus. 

Ordered Room Service for Breakfast ($89), was only presented with a bag of food, coffee with no cream or sugar in a To-Go cup. The food was in paper plates with an aluminum top and I was given plastic silverware that looked like real silverware. All I have to say is LMFAO. Even at a casino as old as the Sahara was,  they brought your room service in a cart and real plates, covered, presented to you for your liking and you were given all the condiments you could ask for along with coffee in a real cup with cream and sugar. Real silverware ! This was a major joke. 

The following night was no better as again it was my birthday. My wife and I had 6:45 reservations, but this idiotic hotel decided to not only sponsor the Las Vegas marathon, but also prompt Metro Police to block the exits not allowing cars or taxis leave the premises. I ended up having to exit the Taxi because we missed our reservation and we had to go back inside and eat at the outrageously overpriced and underwhelming Baazar Meats ($200 for steaks that wouldn't sniff the plate at Del Frisco's) . Luckily the staff was phenomenal so I put them in the good list. 

This pure logistical idiocy almost ruined my birthday, but I was able to get to the MGM via Monorail and make our show. 

In all, this hotel should not be considered a luxury strip hotel. It is blatantly obvious they though they could win on name alone without doing their homework. I suggest management spend a day with the Fertitas because SLS is subpar of Stations Casinos. Stay away if you want 5 Diamond experience.",17,6,0

I was disappointed that the bars weren't fully stocked with stuff too. like they don't have fresh cucumbers and things like that.  but that's just me being picky I guess. but it's little touches like food, and fully stocked bars with more choices than lemons and limes that will make the cabana and pool experience more memorable and make us really excited to do it again. but needless to say, the hotel it still great. we recommend it to everyone. it'll be even nicer when that area gets built up a bit more. right now it's the only decent thing down that far on the strip. but you really don't even ever need to leave the hotel.",1,0,0

-lost my reservation; discovered that upon check-in. Even though I showed them the confirmation email. No real apology or offer to comp the resort fee or anything. 

-stained sheets and comforters; had to be changed TWICE because the maid found another stain when she was called up to change the first set. 

-another hotel with a misguided theme. Not sure who they were trying to target? 20somethings? It reminded me of the Cosmopolitan, another hotel I can't stand. A weird ""dark fairy tale"" theme, as conveyed by monkeys everywhere, and the cheap-ass tapestries haphazardly hung up in the rooms to replace wall paper. SO BIZARRE.

Upon arriving at the SLS I was thinking did I make the wrong decision?  There was only one taxi dropping people off.  I don't think I've ever seen that.  The hotel has a small casino, they didn't even have my favorite game of pai gow but I think it's supposed to be more of a boutique hotel.  The rooms are on the smaller side, smaller than pretty much any hotel room I've been in in Vegas.  Upon walking into the bathroom, I noticed the glasses were completely dirty as in they were used, there were dirt stains on there.  That made me very skeptical.  The rest of the room was fine but on the second night, they left me lotion in place of shampoo.  Before I went to the room, my key card stopped working and it took me 20 minutes to get a new key card.  These issues are what why I'm giving it three stars.

I think the rooms here will get dated quickly and the reason why is they use tiles for the bathroom.  If tiles aren't washed, dirt will build up (i.e. Planet Hollywood) and it'll be black and just gross.

Anyway for $80 it was fine but I don't think I'll be looking forward to staying here again.",0,0,0

Please bear in mind, my issues with this place stem from the fact we spent over $200\/night here. I would have much rather spent that money to get a much nicer hotel (*cough*aria*cough). Had the hotel cost $100\/night or less, my review would be much different.

My boyfriend and I went to Vegas with a large group for business\/pleasure. The group decided on this hotel. Other friends of mine had warned me of how much they hated staying at SLS, but I figured they were exaggerating. After the weekend, I totally understand. 

Here's the thing (or many)... SLS is WAY off the strip. Think Stratosphere... You have to take a cab to go really anywhere, which is not my fav thing to do. Or you could take the train, but for me, no. 
When you get into SLS, it feels dark. The decor, design and actual lighting is dark. You think of walking into many of the nice casinos to at least a bright lobby. Not here. Also, what's with the monkeys everywhere? Don't get me wrong, the hotel is CLEAN and it is TRENDY, just not my style. Certain things about it feels...creepy. (see Photos)

We got to our floor and upon walking down the hallway, I was weirded out for real. The always are black with these Dr. Seuss feeling white grass things all the way down the hall. Dark carpet and mismatched numbers all willy nilly on the doors make you feel like you're in a dark themed fun house...not upscale, not relaxing. (see Photos)

Now, onto the room. Umm...again, the weird grassy paint with black, white and this super pale pink. What? Anyway, it felt so small and so CHEAP. I took many photos. You can just see for yourself. One small window with standard slat blinds (like at your grandma's house) and a pull down shade. So much light seeping thru the sides of the blind, not to mention the HEAT flowing in. GREAT..not getting that super dark hotel room sleep this weekend. Whatevs. Now...on the pull down shade is a photo of a crowd of people. Like their faces..over your head...on your bed. So weird. (see Photos)

The furniture in the room was so cheap. I felt like I might as well stayed at a Best Western dressed in alternative design. The table was an OCD nightmare (see Photo). The top of it was slightly off kilter, permanently. I kept wanting to move it! haha strange. The phone is on that table, across the room. There are two large mirrors on either side of the room, with lights bordering it. Kinda cool. Bright lights. The dresser\/cabinet\/closet piece was quite small and nearly pointless. It was taken up by mostly the mini bar. Who really touches that thing?? Anyway.... there are 4 medium sized drawers, one is filled with a safe. There are a few hangers to hang dresses\/shirts. functional, but you have to look at it the whole time. You can't close away the closet, makes the room feel (again) cheap and messy. Can you tell I like my Vegas rooms to be neat, clean and relaxing? 

The bathroom was odd as well. Not much counter space to get ready (as a girl, you get it) so I had to do makeup and hair on the floor in front of the large mirror in the room. The bathroom felt like a senior citizen's bathroom. Railings everywhere. There was only a shower, no tub. The shower had a bunch of railings too, and a weird fold down seat. Super elderly. Also, the shower had no lip\/divider to keep water from going across your floor. The first day, I made the mistake of leaving my clothes on the floor while showering.. soaking wet mess afterwards. The door is a sliding mirror door that doesn't lock and has a rather large crack\/opening on the sides. So much so, you can see thru into the bathroom! Awkward. I have photos of all this, check it out. 

On to the restaurants and pool (I didn't play in the casino, so IDK about that). The choice of restaurants is slim. Coming from LA, they're all restaurants I can go to here in LA. Boring. I get it, SBE...but still. With SLS being so far from the rest of the strip, we ended up eating at these restaurants most of the time. Felt like majority of the restaurants were polar opposites. Either really casual ""inexpensive"" or super fine dining ""expensive"". Not much in the middle. 

The pool was decent (LUX pool). It wasn't ever super crowded, which I like. The drinks were okay. The food was normal. Music was good, not too loud, not too quiet. But the pool closes at 7pm! Before the sun even went down...okay... sure. 

Room service comes from the Northside Cafe in the casino. Good food, but you receive your room service in paper boxes, plastic ware, and no tray. So do yourself a favor and save the $15 in room service fees, just go order to-go from the restaurant yourself. Room service here is a JOKE. 

Overall, again, had this place cost us $100\/night or less. I would let a lot of these things go. But knowing I could have stayed elsewhere, a place I know I LOVE for the same price, really bruises my bananas.",15,11,1

LOCATION: Anyone with an ability to check Google Maps prior to booking should not be complaining about the location. Yes, it's at the far North of The Strip. As in, not walking distance. However, the monorail is literally across the street and in seven minutes, you're where you want to go. At the end of each day, we were extremely happy that we were staying away from all the mayhem of the Strip. We appreciated that when we got back to the hotel, it felt like we could relax. The casino and restaurants were really busy on both Friday and Saturday nights, so it's still a very social and fun place without being complete madness.

SIZE: The casino is small, which we loved!There were plenty of tables for my boyfriend, and I never had to wait for a machine. Bonus, we never lost each other (unless we wanted to). 

ROOMS: We stayed in the LUX tower - highly recommend, as it seems that these are the biggest rooms at the hotel. You need a room key to operate the elevator to this tower. I was surprised at how quiet the room itself was - we had neighbors on both sides, but the only way I knew this was because of the food plates outside their door. Housekeeping was on it, and came by in the evenings to offer more towels and toiletries. The rooms ARE small, and the closet storage was pretty minimal, so don't expect to spread out too much. 

The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable, the television was enormous, and the mirrors were... um... plentiful :)

Careful with the mini bar. If you store any of your things inside of it, they charge you $30. Also, the snacks all have sensors. If you remove any of them for more than 20 seconds or don't replace it, you'll be charged. 

The shower was amazing - dual showerheads!

DINING and DRINKS: Umami Burger - delicious! Don't let the name fool you, we got some amazing ahi poke and salads there. Bazaar Meats was a true experience - expect to spend a lot of time and a lot of money, but both are worth it. There is no coffee in the room, but you can order a pot of it from room service or head to the coffee and pastry bar downstairs.

POOL: Both pools were closed on the day we arrived, due to high winds and cool temps. But both were open for the remainder of our stay and I could have seen spending an entire day lounging about and sipping cocktails from their pool bar. Great spot to relax, lots of seating, and poolside service.

Staff was great, dealers were fun for the most part, bathrooms on the floor were clean. The decor of the entire place might be described as kind of ""glam noir"", yet it also managed to still be cozy. We would stay again!",1,0,0

Was not at all impressed with our stay here. I was glad our stay was comp'd due to an invitation my mom received in the mail or else I would have thrown a huge fit paying handsomely for such a subpar hotel.

 First off, we drove up to valet only to be told that we weren't in the right place, apparently there's a different valet for hotel guests. Strange set up but whatever, I was not going to let that dampen my spirit. I was actually looking forward to this staycation based on the images on their website. Boy was I in for a big disappointment! Checking in was a nightmare, it was chaotic. The hallway walls being black were creepy. They were probably going for that cool chic vibe but to me it just came across morbid. The room even though small served its purpose. I like the subtle, boutique flair. The bathroom was clean and the showerhead was a nice fixture. Now for the worst part. Though they remodeled the rooms it doesn't change the fact that it's still the old Sahara and it smelled like it too. We had the worst sleep (or lack of it) as far as hotel stays go. The bed was small and so uncomfortable. The air conditioner was the worst as it was blowing directly at our heads, it was not even cold, it was STALE air! 

I was relieved we were only staying one night and that was precisely the reason I didn't bother complaining. I could not wait to get home. The employees we interacted with weren't the friendliest either. Needless to say, we won't be back.",7,4,3

From slow cocktail waitresses to half assed food at the Northside Cafe then getting back at 3 am just to find out no in-room dining!  To top it all off...no bathrobes in the rooms.

Coming from L.A and wanting to support SLS, I felt let down in too many ways. 
From the moment we drove in the vibe was a downer. 
Don't let the pictures fool you. 
After check in,  you walk down a stark white hallway to the elevator. Similar to a police station. Immediately, I thought what have we gotten our selves in to. 
Open the door to our ""Lux suite"" and there was NOTHING Lux about it. It was a box, a very small box that was done beyond cheap. All of the little pops of accessories and colors were gone. Add some padding on the walls and you would be paying for your own psychiatric room. 
We upgraded thinking that would make things much better, double the size room. NOPE, just a bigger white cheap psychiatric room. Ughhhhh. 
We put in a concern of dislike and they offered to discount us for the resort fee. Wow, lovely considering their pool was closed and you couldn't even go outside to enjoy a drink poolside. 
The casino was dead. Couldn't win if you sat there for days. There machines are set to make you lose because someone has to pay there rent. Duh! 
What a shame that L.A's best restaurants are in there and it just looks like a sad ghost town. 
I see a very short life for this place. 
P.S- even the employees seem to be embarrassed of their own place of employment.

For some, this is a negative, but you can always take an uber if you want to be in the center of the action.

The hotel is cool and the rooms are pretty swanky. 

Great food options including Katsuya and Jose Andres. If you want to go a little cheaper there is Northside and Umami burger.

Another plus is the rooms are very clean which isn't always an easy thing to maintain considering the number of people who visit any hotel in Las Vegas.

More of a feminine décor style but worked perfectly for me.

This is a review of the hotel side of this casino.  I am a travel industry employee and roughly half my nights are spent in hotels not of my choosing all over the country.  I am not a Vegas person so this review is meaningless to anyone interested in the casino scene.  This is aimed at anyone who wants a pleasant hotel experience.  The one thing I was looking forward to was trying out Umami Burger, but it turns out it's a tiny little place embedded in the casino so no thanks.

Clean, quiet, comfortable.  Isn't that what any hotel should strive for?  That's all I want when I pull in at 1AM completely exhausted.

Clean - 4 out of 5: ok it's a fairly new property so how gross can it be?  On the other hand the entire motif is driven by a flat black matte color that shows every speck of dirt and is utterly depressing.

Quiet - 0 out of 5: Room had the typical outrageously priced mini-bar\/snack center with a refrigerator that would not stop making that annoying whining compressor noise. I tried to unplug it but it's hard wired in so there's no way to make it stop.  Also there's a weird electrical hum in the background coming from who knows where.  Ok, so let's turn on the air to make some white noise to mask that.  The A\/C unit sounds like a truck is idling in your room.  I put in ear plugs to sleep and even that couldn't drown out the ruckus.  Ok, so let's turn off the A\/C unit and just use ear plugs to block the electrical noises.  Unfortunately...

Comfortable - 0 out of 5:  the bed has a bottom sheet that's not been laid flat and all wrinkled up but I'm too tired to undo the bed to mess with it.  Uh oh, apparently that's also the ONLY sheet on this bed, because the top layer is a duvet-style ""comforter"" that's too thick. So it's not comfortable to sleep with no top sheet layer, but it's way too warm to sleep with this heavy comforter thing on and the A\/C turned off.  

Then there's the room decor itself.  At what point does an adult with a brain in their head evaluate the overall appearance and comfort level of a floor during a renovation and say ""NO NO NO, we've made a HUGE error here""...?  It looks like the design of a rebellious 12-year-old after the parent has made a couple of quiet decisions:  1. I need to pick my battles and I'm going to let junior win this one, and 2. I need to get my kid into counseling.  The hallways are mostly black walls with black carpeting and that theme continues into the rooms.  All the appointments in the room are angular, jarring and obnoxious, with cheap uncomfortable IKEA style furniture and an irritating askew desktop that makes using it chore.  Non-functional can be cute if it's cheerful and fun; when nonfunctional turns into annoying and depressing at every turn the overall effect is a stay where you feel like you've been given a continual noogie.  

The hotel's literature describes its decor as ""whimsical"".  Anyone who's ever gotten a noogie knows that it's only whimsical for the person giving it, not so much when you're on the receiving end.",5,4,3

Positives - The SLS is right off the monorail. So it's literally only a quick 10 min ride to the main strip. I liked this because there wasn't a lot of noisy foot traffic in and out of the hotel. This hotel is also very artsy. A lot of gigantic mirrors everywhere, fun art on the walls and throughout the lobby. The rooms are very intimate as we were in the story tower. The best thing about staying here was the service we received from Magda (I hope I got her name right). She's at the registration desk. She was super nice and very kind at check in. 
The foxtail pool was also super cool and quaint. It isn't a loud party like ones you will find at Tao, XS, Marquee or Encore, but it is very relaxing and a place where u can actually lay out and enjoy the sun! Pool area was very clean and super accommodating. 

Negatives - We booked this hotel with a free mini bar option. When we got there we were told we couldn't have it because the promotion had expired. How in the world can a promotion expire that you booked in advanced?!? If that's the case the option shouldn't have been available when we booked!!! This was super annoying and very rude in my opinion. This was honestly the biggest turn off being that we were celebrating two birthdays for the weekend! 
Another negative, the rooms are not as spacious as the Venetian or other hotels on the strip. Usually I hear about SLS being such a great hotel, so I decided that the one here in Vegas would be awesome. Wrong. The rooms are so small you can barely move. The bathroom door didn't close all the way and the layout of the door opening was terrible! Every time I would use the sink my friend would slide open the door to use the bathroom and hit my foot. 

I could go on and on but sadly we were very disappointed in our stay at SLS and probably will not choose to stay again. As a travel blogger and frequent traveler around various countries, I always have great reviews about places. I wish I could have given a better one here. Who knows. Maybe I might try to give the SLS another shot. 

This stay was the Story Tower. Maybe next I will try the World tower being that there are two sides to the hotel. 

Also. Back to the free mini bar. I would call the hotel and ask about it if you receive this option via booking. Because if you book it and they ""expire"" the promotion like they did with us, you will be very disappointed. 

Back to Magda, in our promotion being expired, she did give us drink tickets and a $50 room comp, which is why she actually saved an extra star in this review. But in reality, you don't really need a room comp or drink tickets when you are in Vegas out of your room the entire trip. Hope this hotel gets it together! It's beautiful but lacks a lot.",7,0,0

Every single staff member was beyond helpful!  From the minute we arrived we were greeted with a smile and treated like royalty.  Throughout our entire stay, we did not have 1 interaction with anyone that was less than pleasant.  The hotel itself is very well kept.  Very clean!  If someone spilled something, it was cleaned up almost immediately.  I am looking forward to my next trip to Vegas so that I can return to the SLS.  

The staff in the casino was also outstanding.  I used to spend a lot of time in Vegas and have encountered less than friendly staff\/dealers and I am happy to say that everyone was great at this hotel!

Our hotel room, while it was a little smaller than I was hoping, was VERY comfortable!  The blackout curtain was AWESOME!  The room felt very modern, very clean, very hip.  Loved the sliding bathroom door.  The bed was SOOOO COMFORTABLE!!!!

So I am not a big Vegas junkie, but SLS offered 2 free nights, for which I had no trouble reserving. Upon arriving, one of the elevators in the parking garage was out of service, and  it was rather filthy... but I guess Vegas can be as such. My girlfriend and I arrived early around 11am and received no trouble getting our room keys early, which was really nice. 

THE STAFF WAS EXTREMELY FRIENDLY. Everyone had big smiles, and the guy who gave us our keys went on about which restaurants to try. 

THE ROOM: After looking online I expected modern decor with a bit of a vintage look. We grabbed a King bed in the World Tower, and it did not look like the pictures. There were a lot of mirrors with a couch at the foot of the bed which held true to the pictures, but the walls were painted white with some black grass looking streaks. The window looking out at the Stratosphere was dirty which made our poor view look that much worse. The black out shade, had a picture of a crowd of white people which was awkward to look out with the blinds down. The bathroom was pretty standard with a tall wide shower head and no tub. There is no lock on the bathroom door, so if you have guests over, anticipate someone might get a peak at you squattin. The fridge was a little annoying. It was fully stocked and I took a few things out to put my own items in, and luckily I noticed a small sign saying I will be charged because there is a weight sensor detecting their items. The room didnt feel all that clean, with the dirty windows and some dirt on the couch left me feeling how clean are the beds.... and then I looked up at the wall above the TV and noticed brown spot stuck on the wall, which might be leftover coffee or coke maybe from a previous guest... what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas....

THE POOL: As goes with most Vegas pools... finding a place to sit was tough... even though there were occasional light showers. They had a lot of couches with pillows scattered around, which I am not sure I felt too comfortable laying my half naked body over the porous fabric where a previous hung over half naked body had sprawled across. There were some benches built into the pool, right above the water, which was nice if you could snag one. Cabanas were also available for reservations, as well as a bar in the center and towel service hidden behind the stage next to the random metallic duck.

THE CASINO: The casino was probably the nicest upgrade. It didn't smell heavily of smoke and decor was appealing with casual seating around the casino with a bit of an upscale image. The dealers seemed nice and table service came by regularly. 

OVERALL: It was nothing special. The SLS seems like they just repainted the Sahara and called it fancy.  I probably would not come back here unless, they offered free nights again. The only thing I would say really positive is the restaurant inside had great french press coffee, which made waking up that much easier. Do yourself a favor, pay some extra cash, and go further down the strip where there is better quality and where all the excitement is.",1,0,0

I was constantly wanting to leave the location and go to another ""fun"" hotel. During the day the inside of the hotel (on the casino floor) was so dark and gloomy. The design of the hotel was really nice, though. I did not like the fact that we had to drive around to the back where the valet was located. The front of the hotel (which has the huge blob-man statue) was not even the entrance with valet (totally sucks!). I would think that the valet entrance should be at the front of the hotel.

So it didn't dawn on me that this wasn't going to be a new hotel; for some reason I had it in my head that the Sahara was demolished and this hotel was built from the floor.  Nope.  That was disappointing.  The reception area\/check in is also not well organized and the lady that helped me was a little rude when talking with me.

The pictures online make the room look a lot bigger then it really is.  I stayed in the 'World Tower' with the men in ugly plaid jackets to check my keycard every time I walked through the hallway.  There are two pillows on the full sized (no, not queen) bed; one that is really puffy and square, and then a flat and long rectangular one.  Both sucked.  I ended up sleeping flat on the bed.  Oh, and the bed.  The bed.  It was higher off the ground at the feet section then at my head.  That didn't help trying to sleep off my hangover.  And they used couches as bed frames.  And what was up with the Germans on the window covering?  Not a great touch.  Windows were small for a hotel, also.  Not enough plugs, water doesn't get too hot, my toilet seat was broken and though I called to get it fixed, the guy never showed up.  No kidding.  Had to call on two separate occasions to get two extra towels, because apparently word doesn't get out to staff that a request was made.  Annoying.

I booked on Las Vegas.com for the room but wish I had just stayed where I normally stay with how disappointed I was.  It was also like being home in LA; there wasn't any restaurants that I can't eat here, inside the casino.  And what's up with all the Fred Segal shops?  Do people even like Fred Segal anymore?

It seems like a good deal, but it's too good to be true.  Oh, also, accounting charges you for more nights then you stayed because they don't read your folio from Las Vegas.com prior to charging you.  That's always awesome.  Thankfully they credited the night they charged me back immediately.

And did anyone else notice the marshmellow man statue out front?",4,4,0

I also don't hear any noise from the hall. No conversations, no doors slamming. These are rare and awesome things. The bummer is that the blinds, while nice to look at, allow a flood of light into the room. This isn't amazing at 6am. The other big downside is the noise. It is strange, is it the windows? We are on the 21st floor and it is impossibly loud in our room. Cars, busses, trucks, horns, trains, and while it seems impossible, the list goes on. Again, it really isn't a problem until early in the morning when you are trying to sleep. 

We noticed the front desk flaws that others had mentioned. The line was moving quick, but when someone stepped away the gentleman at the end seemed to be hiding behind a big post. Minutes went by and when my husband decided to walk down and see, he was asked if he was checking out by a guy just standing there doing nothing! Are many people checking out at the front desk at 2:30pm? That said he helped us and we did get our room a bit early which is always nice. 

We have had no issues with the location. We have used the monorail with ease, although it wasn't great when it shut down at midnight last night. A cab was easily found and one night we actually walked from MGM to SLS. Food is also strong, Umami burger being our favorite. 

The casino is clean and just less depressing than most at the other end. The pools were both lovely and overall we had a nice time, we just really enjoy sleep and didn't get as much as we would have liked.

I attempted to call guest services to inquire about their late check out policy. After holding for over ten minutes I called back. I said that I just wanted to know what the policy is and if it is worth the hold time. I was told, very rudely, that guest services has been told not to offer late check out and that the only option is to hold for the front desk and that it all depends on bookings for the next day, etc. I understand all of that but seriously SLS, empower the people who are actually available to help your guests. If I sit on hold for an hour the late checkout inquiry becomes moot. This is an effective way to offend your guests at the last possible moment.",4,2,1

SLS uses technology and simple effects to affect their perceived room value. Lots of mirrors - which can be very memorable - a smart TV, white and bright and lots of light in the room. 

Restroom has Ciel Spa toiletries, nice shower and sink. 

Restaurants are nice. Hit or miss experiences. 

""Meh""s: It is not a ""resort"" but it charges a resort fee

Nice gotcha amenities, like the $14 in-room drinks.

Layout of casino is similar to old Sahara...casino here, casino there. Things in between. 

The nightclubs, on a Friday, aren't busy. Even if packed, I'd give them a 4. Very average layout. Lots of patchy sound spots. No intention or purpose, just the basics.  Restrooms in the clubs are small. The nightclubs themselves are small. It's a small budget kind of place. 

Overall, it isn't bad. It just isn't great. For the price point, SLS hits the dart board but doesn't score high. If you ever stayed at Sahara you will notice how they've essentially used the Sahara bones and gussied it up a bit. 

I'd stay here again iff. the price was sub-$50 plus the ridiculous $32.48 resort fee that should just be included in the total cost. And stop charging for Internet and a gym that few use. 

Maybe it should get 2 stars but I'd like to give them the benefit of a silver lining.",1,0,0

By the the end the week, the charge on my debit was no longer in ""pending status"" but instead charged. Pretty much they have charged me and my cousin for the same room for the resort fees. I have called 5x so far with bank account screen shots and of course no one can help and they keep transferring me and giving me the run around. Very disappointing that they did this to us.

- Really friendly and great staff.
- Clean hotel.  Decent rooms.  Nice beds.
- pretty nice fitness facility.

Disappointments \/ interesting(?):
- tried for elegance; comes off as cheesy chic.
- draped rooms.  interesting.  Probably saves on wear and tear on the walls, but is kind of strange.  The wall coverings were torn in my room to fit around the lights behind the bed; not cut and fit.
- a mirror above the bed.  really?
- there is a window to the shower that displays  to the  bedroom. 
- Hallways could use vacuuming.  Room  service plates left in halls from when  I checked in at 7:30 pm to at least 3:00 the next day.
- long lines at check in\/out.
- trendy accoutrements here and there (elevators\/pics) but then odd compilation of music from Beach Boys to Keisha to contemporary.  Even the room glassware seems cheesy, like something from an estate sale.
- Room radio missing 3 of 4 corner pads which in turn scratches the nightstand.

The SLS is the old Sarah that's been remodeled, & they did a decent job with it. The hotel\/casino feels more like a place in downtown Los Angeles or Sunset. The valet was pretty fast the entire weekend, around a 5 minute wait time (the hotel wasn't that busy). My room was in the Story Tower, based on all the other reviews I'm sure all the rooms in the Story Tower are small\/intimate, there's no ice machine in the Story Tower so you can call the front desk & they'll bring you some.

The rooms are pretty basic with a bed, couch, TV, & a hanger area for your clothes (not a closet), bathroom, & there's also a mini bar (not a fridge that you can use). I'd compare the SLS rooms to what'd you get at the Luxor, Excalibar, or Treasure Island a decent basic room so don't expect anything like they Wynn, or Cosmo.

There's only two other big casinos at this end of the strip (circus & the stratosphere) so there isn't much site seeing or walking around to do down on this side. Downtown Vegas is only about 3-5 miles north so you're pretty much in between the the center of the strip & downtown.

If you're planning a trip to Vegas & you're going on price, if the SLS is around the more affordable places on the strip it's worth it to stay here. If there's a price difference of $50 a night & you're deciding between here or dump like circus circus or the flamingo save yourself the headache & stay here.",2,2,2

He booked on a site where the hotel is revealed after you pay. We both did some research on the hotel the night prior to our road trip to Nevada and were a little nervous after reading the same article entailing the hotel's struggles due to its being sort of ""cut off"" from the rest of the Strip, enmired in stalled and\/or failed construction projects. 

We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived, however. Plentiful parking, bright lights, and a bevy of mini dress-dressed ladies-- the place was abuzz. A bit of a line to check in, but the woman at the desk was very helpful and accommodating. We ended up in the Lux Tower, (later learning that the hotel has three room sections: World, Story, and Lux) which is the nicest of the lodgings. Once you see your room, you realise that you are in the hipsteriest of hotels, but it's amusing, to say the least.

Our room was white and spacious with tapestries covering the walls in mock-Victorian design. We immediately noted the mirror over the bed and giggled like children. They certainly covered all of their bases! We ignored the minibar completely, as we'd brought our own snacks, but were bummed to discover that the only fridge in the room exists to accommodate more minibar trifle and they charge a flat $30 fee for stuffing it with your own schwag.

King bed with one very fluffy and warm blanket and gigantic white pillows for a most comfortable sleep, flanked by two night tables, one with a remote-controlled radio and the other with a phone and writing materials. Across from the bed was a big window, long couch taking up the majority of the length of the wall, and a table. The flat screen television was easily the size of my own bed at home, so it was hilarious to see the mammoth font sizes on screen while perusing the hotel restaurant menus (which was such an added bonus to be able to do). 

The bathroom was decently large, with a mirrored sliding wall acting as the door. Inside there was a closet with hangers (and soft white robes) as well as a few drawers and an ironing board. The sink was raised ceramic and shallow, outfitted with a ton of towels. The blow dryer had a folding handle and retractable cord. Hotel spa line Ciel products lined the shower, a shower which, if not for the many things to do and see in Vegas, I would have elected to spend all of my time in.

The shower was HUGE! As in, six people could have showered simultaneously in it with no problem. There were two shower heads, one on the wall and one waterfall type overhead. Glass door, white tiled floor. The shower was my favourite part of our room, but I just really effing love showering. The acoustics in the bathroom were great too; we had a battle of the boy bands while we showered and I was sincerely surprised that no one complained about the noise.

We ate at Umami Burger (yuck!) and Ku Noodle (yum!) inside of the hotel. A big selling point for our stay was Cleo, the Mediterranean restaurant, but we never got to dine there; they're only open for dinner (from 6-11:30 pm)! This was a huge disappointment. There's a café (The Perq) for your caffeine and pastry needs as well as a piano bar-lite (Monkey Bar) with cheapish simple drinks and a pianist with a mouth on him, as well as a number of other places we did not explore.

The pool area was deemed a ""day club"", so its use required an extra fee, one that we were not willing to pay. I'm not sure if they usually do this, or if it was simply a way to garner extra profit during the holiday weekend, but it was pretty weak that the pool was roped off with literal red carpet style ropes and guarded by burly dudes in sunglasses.

My only legitimate complaint about the hotel is with the room service. One morning, we decided to languish before beating feet around the Strip. The menu choices are pretty poor: very, very boring, limited, and uninspired. Not to mention, more expensive than the dishes in the hotel restaurants! I got the ""protein"" frittata ($14) with feta cheese, asparagus, and avocado in lieu of turkey and an English muffin. It was good, but not particularly remarkable, and arrived lukewarm after our one-hour wait for delivery. My boyfriend ordered a carafe of orange juice (not listed on the menu) which was noted as a ""special preparation"" request on our bill and cost $18! I don't care what hotel you are; unless your oranges are hand-squeezed by pygmy North Pole elves and topped with a smattering of gold leaf flecks, a carafe of orange juice should not cost more than your meal. There was also a $5 room service fee and the girl who brought our food seemed very unhappy about her job or life, perhaps both.

In short, would I stay here again? Yes, definitely. But I will bring my own OJ, thank you very much.",1,1,2

I was actually happy about a new SLS hotel opening in Vegas, and was looking forward to staying here on this trip. We stayed at one of the biggest suites in Lux tower for 3 nights and 4days, tried pretty much all the restaurants and bars here, actually all the places that are opened during our stay, so I think my review is pretty legit in a lot of ways. 

They like drapes, a lot of drapes, on the walls, all over the walls, in the suites, at the spa, everywhere! They don't like bathtubs, NO bathtub in our 955sf SLS king suite at Lux tower? !!! They should change the oversized bath description on their site to oversized dining table about this suite! Seriously, there is only a king bed for 2 people in the bedroom, why on earth would they put a huge dining table for 6 people in the living room? Not to mention the huge couch in living room that can easily fit in 12 thin people, and another couch in bedroom with a small dining table, are we hosting dinner parties in this suite or what?! It's just odd....

Our suite is very spacious with separate living room and bedroom, a guest powder room and a decent sized master bathroom. NO closets at all, just a storage shelve with a few drawers and in-room safe in the bathroom. Did SLS tell Starck to use the minimum cost on remodeling? If they didn't build new closets and bathtubs and walls, the cost must be the lowest for them, the walls were just drapes with pictures on them, that's convenient for sure, just put on drapes all over the walls! It looks like they intended to waste a lot of spaces to make a comfy guest room, hey let's just put the furnitures in and foregt about the rest of the spaces! Easy for them, not so comfy for us hotel guests.... Just saying...

But, I still love Starck's interior design, all whites with popped out pinks, very girly and beautiful, just not very practical, we guests deserve a bathtub for what we pay for a suite! 

Because of the small size of this hotel, there is not much going on here. All fine dining restaurants only open for dinner, even the casual dining Ku noodle only opens for dinner? Comeon! Who eats noodles for dinner? It's for lunch! We stayed for 4 days and ran out of places to eat, especially during the day. And I am never gonna stand in line to order pizzas at that pizza joint, just not gonna happen! Since it's winter, there is only LIFE nightclub, Foxtail pool club is closed for the season, same as the pool, guests can still go there but it's just too cold to hang at the pool area.

A little shopping at Fred Segal, different stores at different wings of the hotel, I got something of course, the selections were not as good as the one in Santa Monica. There are only two bars, Monkey bar and Center bar, they share some same specialty cocktails I noticed. There is a screen above the center bar, it plays 50 images that is so cool to look at! 

The room service was miss and hit, we ordered room service on Friday night but it never came, they still charged to our room? WTH? Ordered room service again on Sunday night, the options were extremely limited as the lady told me on the phone ""it's late night so we don't have that!"" Okay.... just flatbread, omelettes and bottle of champagne with OJ to make mimosa! At least the food was pretty delicious, loved the hash browns.

Overall this is a cute luxury boutique hotel, the Lux tower we stayed at was great, close to the monkey bar, spa \/ gym, and monorail. And it's very private, you need guest keys to get in the elevators. But....will I stay here again? Maybe just maybe for one night, more than that? Very unlikely. The service was disorganized from time to time, not enough restaurants and lounges. Only three fine dining establishments, had to cross out Bazzar meat by Jose Andres cause it sounded like a chamber of horror to me. And above all? NO bathtub in our big suite! It's completely unacceptable!

This hotel just didn't work for me as well as I expected, it's luxury alright, on both prices and servies, but the suite, restaurants and bars just fell a little bit short! 

The rates of regular guest rooms in other towers are very low, because they are very small rooms. So if you are looking for luxury hotel at affordable prices, this hotel might work for you! 

Ps. Depite how much they love drapes, the drapes don't close completely in our suite bedroom, there is a gap... So bad!",15,1,3

Taxi from the airport cost me $30.  Arrived at the hotel and was overwhelmed by the perfumed smell that was pumped into the entire lobby\/casino.  Horrible smell and so strong it gave me a headache.  Then to the room... we booked a room with 2 beds which turned out to be 2 double beds, not queen-size beds.  Very lame.  Overall the room was fairly nice but small.  The A\/C vent was on the wall opposite the bed I slept in so we could either (a) sleep in a room with no A\/C (it was over 100 degrees that weekend), or (b) have cold air blowing on my head all night.  Both choices sucked.  Now it's summer in Vegas so of course we wanted to lay by the pool.

This property is newly remodeled and a great value but I don't like non themed vegas hotels. I like volcanos, pirates or any other goofy theme. I'm also not a fan of the neighborhood that is so far north but the historic value of the property makes up for certain shortcomings.

The new remodel was tasteful and was done in a way that respected the previous property that it replaced, the Sahara. The remodel kept, preserved and refurbished what worked and tore down and improved what didn't work. Sahara was a popular spot for the Rat Pack and there is much history associated with the property. Can't say that about the boring, sterile, ice cold City Center.

A small pool, casino and rooms that are suitable for getting some sleep - again value is the theme for this spot. If its your first time to Vegas I would recommend something closer to the center of the strip - perhaps a mega resort so that you don't feel as if you missed out on something. If you have been to Vegas tons of times and feel as though you've seen the city this might be a great choice for you. Maybe your tired of nonsense novelty things like pirates or crazy looking pink flamingos.

Other great aspects of this property is that it is on a monorail stop and has a fun neighbor, Circus Circus - for the kids or all you overgrown adults.

I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend a couple weekends ago. It was the weekend of the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, and the hotel was packed with the ""fight crowd"" who invaded the entire strip. 

The front desk guy didn't greet us properly. We stood in front of him for over 30 seconds while he stared at his computer and ignored us. He looked up briefly after I said excuse me and gave a quick ""I'll be with you in a minute"". It wasn't a friendly response, either. 

We got to our tower room on the fifth floor, and it was beautiful. The beds were soft and comfortable, and the decor very modern and clean looking. We ordered room service, and the food (grilled cheese and tomato soup) was better than I expected for hotel room service. 

SLS had two rap artists playing at their pool that weekend. When we arrived, Puff Daddy was doing the afternoon party. Later that night, Lil Wayne started. I couldn't sleep until past three am because the sound of that awful rapper's voice yelling in a microphone carried up to our room and kept me awake. After getting no sleep, we checked out in the morning and went to another hotel...after the valet took forever to find my vehicle because they had the wrong ticket in my car. 

The second incident involved the Rock In Rio concert last weekend. A group of my friends had tickets to the LiFE nightclub while this event was happening across the street. The garage attendants off the Las Vegas Blvd entrance told us we'd have to pay $30.00 ""event fee"" to park in a free garage. The valet attendant I spoke with afterwards said the valet was only for registered guests and suggested I ""park at another hotel and get a cab, but I can't help you"" as he walked away. We had tickets to their club and the staff was rude and unhelpful. My friend found out that the Paradise garage entrance was not guarded, so we were able to park there for free. At no time did SLS security or valet staff tell us that ever could park free at the other garage. They were too concerned with being rude and collecting ridiculous parking fees for an event they weren't even hosting.

Feels like a fancy boutique hotel even though it has so many rooms.  They brought in all of the most popular brands in the SBE empire, Katsuya, Foxtail, Umami, etc.  The vibe in the hotel is definitely hip and cool.
The room was nicely decorated with nice toiletries from Ciel, their own spa.  However, there were no robes or slippers and there is just a simple shower with no bath tub. 
The main complain I have with the hotel is the smell in the lobby.  I don't know what smell it is exactly but it sure isn't pleasant.  Also, the 1 mile distance from CityCenter is an inconvenience as well.  We try to drive around but parking is always a nightmare.  We decided to take a taxi and it's at least $15 each way to CityCenter.

So, this place wasn't nearly as exciting as we thought it would be.  First off, the rooms are tinyyyyyy.  They reminded me of European style hotel rooms.  Also, FULL SIZED beds.  Not queens, not kings - full beds!  There was a lot of unwanted cuddling because of this.  Also, they weren't comfortable.  So theres that.

The elevators.  Yup, you'll grow old waiting for them.  Luckily I took the stairs so I got my workout in.  How they have 6 elevators and only two seem to work, I don't know.  Bring reading material.

The pool.  If there is a pool party going on and you don't want to partake you need to go to the ""Lux Pool"".  You will be greeted by a security guard that won't let you take your hotel drink into the pool.  He also threatened to arrest my friend since she couldn't find her ID.  Once she found it, he didn't even look at her birth date.  The Lux pool is quite small and uneventful.

Also, depending on where your room is, you may be stuck hearing the insanely loud music coming from the larger pool.  All day and all night.  At some point I was hoping for some quiet.

We looked for hotels online and saw that the rooms at SLS looked really gorgeous so we immediately we were sold. Once we walked in we were greeted with a waft of nasty air freshener. It was as if someone took a poop and then decided to mask it with with a crazy amount of air freshener...not great. Check in was easy so no complaints there. We were stuck in the elevator lobby for a while because we didn't realize that we needed to use our keys to activate the elevators. Honestly, it was kind of a pain in the butt doing that every single time we had to go up to our room. Once we got to our room we had problems getting the door open. The lock on the door wasn't your average card swipe thing, instead it was a pad that you had to wave your key in front of. Eventually we realized that the key we got was faulty. When we finally got into our room I was a little underwhelmed. The room looked nothing like the pictures we saw online. I guess by now I should know better than to trust the pictures online.. The beds in the room were comfortable but really small and the sheets were dirty. Like some reviewers mentioned, they had this weird mirror sliding door for the bathroom which was strange because it didn't really close all the way and it also didn't lock. The one thing I did like about the room were the mirrors they had on either sides of the walls. The mirrors had lights on the borders so it was like a floor length vanity mirror. 

The overall look of the hotel seems classy but the theme is confusing. Not really sure what they were going for with the random hands and lips coming out of the walls in the lobby and the monkeys everywhere. My sister thought it was maybe an Alice in Wonderland thing? We had a chance to check out the Lux Pool during our stay. It's a rooftop pool that they had for guests at the hotel. It was really empty because we were there on a Monday which was awesome. If you're 21+ then I would recommend you go to the Foxtail Pool that's located downstairs. On the weekends it's a day club but on the weekdays it's just a regular resort pool and it's much nicer and bigger than the Lux Pool upstairs. 

Overall this hotel was just okay. I don't think I would stay here again, I'd rather just pay a little more to stay in one of the bigger hotels on the strip.",0,0,0

I'm just a fan of some of the SBE properties and was in town visiting from Los Angeles and wanted to check it out as I love a great hotel and had high hopes. I also throw large events and often book hotels and so I wanted to check this out as I thought it might be good for one or more of my upcoming shows. 

To be clear, I can only comment on parking, lobby, gaming and general layout. I had no interaction with the staff. Frustratingly  I was disappointed at my experience from driving into to the out-dated detached garage to the non-working elevator in the garage. 

I honestly expected much more from SLS group. Unfortunately, the word, dated, ""wanna be cool"" come to mind. This reminds me of one of those awful Miami beach hotels that pretends to be Botique, but is more of a façade  with the Ikea furniture disguised as something supposedly artisti and chic trying just a little to hard and ending up tacky. It's all there too, the Faux plastic ""art"" chairs\/couches, the white\/black concept etc. 

As far as my walkthrough. The hallways all the way to the back where they keep check in, were overly dark. Maybe to appear sexy? Not sure, but we actually thought the lights were broken it was so dark. The casino was quiet and the restaurants and bars were cramped together and didn't seem very well thought out more as though they wanted to squeeze as much in as possible. And it appears that Fred Segal is the only retail outlet. 

Not to be a snob just someone who likes hotels, but I'm guessing that guests accustomed to more Holiday Inn or Ramada Inn will enjoy this place, but only because they don't know better. But for any of you that travel and enjoy a 4-5 star diamond hotels, you'll know when you step in. 

It feels a little like the SLS took over the Sahara to just say that SLS\/Sam Nezarian is now in Vegas. But unfortunately, to really compete with the big boys of lux hotels, you need to actually be a lux hotel, which the SLS is not. 

All that said, just to be fair, I didn't stay here and I do like SLS Beverly Hills. The hotel is still fairly new, so this is just a heads up for those that were thinking about visiting. Your experience may be different from mine. With enough comments\/complaints perhaps SLS will make the improvements necessary to compete at a high level and become a great resort, we can always dream, after all it is Vegas.

Although it's a newer hotel, it seems cheaply built and already somewhat outdated compared to other fairly new hotels. The rooms are compacted and the bed is directly in the middle of the room. The shower was built with yellow tile walls (ugly IMO) and the toilet wall was painted yellow. Just imagine sitting on the toilet with the wall inches away from ur face. It wasn't comfortable at all. The vanity is very small and is located outside between both the shower and toilet. 

 My girlfriend and I stayed from 4\/24\/16- 4\/25\/16 Because it was a cheaper alternative. There's not much to do here so having some sort of transportation to the strip is highly recommended. If you have a car, you just have to drive down a few blocks and make a right to get to the strip. There doesn't seem to be any newer popular slots here so I'd save my money and play elsewhere. 

Food options aren't that great either. They have a cafe and a pizzeria in the lobby if you have no other choice. Also, the parking lot wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for their elevators. They only have two and it takes forever for them to go from from top to bottom. I believe it only has 5 floors.. So unless you like waiting, you're better off taking the stairs to the left. The elevators in the hotel were extremely small and smelled like cigarettes. You can maybe fit four people with luggage in one trip. 

After only staying for one night, I definitely won't be back. The distance from the strip, surrounding area seeming sketchy especially at night, the lack of slots and pure entertainment of the entire hotel to go along with the small rooms all affected my experience. If you're looking to stay for one night like we did, I guess it's not that bad. But if you're looking for multiple nights you'll definitely want to stay elsewhere.",0,0,0

Went for opening day. I understood it was not going to be a top tier resort but was expecting something cool, sleek and trendy. Instead, the place looked cheap and almost bordered on ugly. I did not go into the rooms but did check out the place overall to see what they had in terms of restaurants and amenities.

I went to their buffet and it was ridiculously limited. It was opening day and opening weekend and there was little to celebrate there. Nothing lavish or interesting for Weekend Brunch. No salads or fresh veggies anywhere, no desserts, and no real options in terms of eats.

If they had 100 items (including the milk and butter) I would be shocked. The quality of some of their items was high and some of the food was tasty, but my overall impression of the place was not a good one.

They had three pizzas,   three different cold salmon options, crab legs, made to order omelets, sausages, bacon and other standard breakfast fare, a wide variety of dim sum offerings, a  few Chinese dishes, three pastas, a carving station, one Indian dish, three soups, twosushi rolls and one salmon sushi,  some fruit, a  pretty decent baked good section with overly dry donuts and excellent waffles and pancakes, a little yogurt and cereals and that was pretty much it. 

There was nothing distinctive or special other than the lack of basics offered almost everywhere else. Instead of desserts, they had a few cookies and boring ice creams.  Instead of fresh salads or any greenery, they had nothing but one cooked broccoli dish. 

Some of the food looked interesting but it was was hard to enjoy lukewarm food. The worst part of the buffet is that cold food was warm and hot food was cold. They did little to make the food appetizing when it had sat there cold for too long. We were there two hours and in that time, I think the cold pizza sat there the whole time with no one touching it. 

Some of the food was tasty and would have been great if served hot.
The coffee was pretty good.
Waffles when fresh were good with a great batter.
Bacon was nice quality.

Rather than use the tiny space  they had intelligently to offer small dishes of lot of interesting items, they use huge dishes to serve up enormous pans of very basic items like feta cheese that you can buy anywhere.  

For one of the few stations they had available, they had sliced bread across a whole set up where they should have had desserts. A wall of sliced bread that you can buy anywhere is what they offered for $30 per person?! Not even interesting rolls but basic sliced bread. Ugh!

I had the distinct impression that there were very few items being cooked fresh by chefs and many more prep and serve ready made items by cooking staff.

This was opening week and they may not have yet had their act together, but unless they really change their approach, I think it will be a nice buffet for the folks who are staying at the hotel and nothing more. 

I am writing this review with the hopes that for the locals who live close by and for the foodies who love Vegas bufffets, this can be a real destination buffet with an emphasis on more options and a real commitment to making sure food is served fresh and piping hot when its supposed to be hot.

They had promised a new concept in buffet dining, but there is nothing new about cold congealed food and basic offerings at premium prices.

I was very much looking forward to all the new restaurants. But after looking in on them, I think I may wait for reviews before trying them. In terms of space and furnishings, none of the new restaurants looked appealing to me.",10,3,0

Room was fine, though I was charged $35 a night for an extra pull-away bed when the room was $45. That's somewhat ridiculous IMO.

Then, when I checked out 2 days later, I was informed that I had somehow spent $75 at the bar and charged it to my room. That was clearly a mistake since I did not set foot in any bar during my stay. So this made me wonder how the hell it's even possible to authorize charges to a room number without any form of ID or room key card. Maybe it's not and you can just charge it to any random room. Anyway, that's a seriously flawed system and outta be fixed.

Our only gripes was that there wasn't an ice machine in our tower so we had to request a bucket of ice to be delivered.

Also, some of the best restaurants thanks to SBE. We had a fantastic NYE at Foxtail with Robin Thicke leading the midnight countdown. Classy crowd, and not too overbooked. Finally, the rates were great compared to other hotels on the strip for NYE because the hotel has only been open for a few months (SLS is the newly renovated Sahara).

Now the bad... if I had to sum up this hotel in one word it would be lazy. I'm going to start with the couple of comments that other guests told me at the time of checkout (no this doesn't count towards my review rating). The World Tower had no hot water that morning, and if you read other reviews this is apparently a trend. Another guest told me that his client (a rap artist) was literally spit at by a valet as a response to him acting cocky.

Now my experience: I had a good amount of grievances following my 2 night stay here at SLS. To their credit, the Hotel Manager comped us the resort fees. But this hotel does not come close to the Beverly Hills SLS, where they do really stand for Style, Luxury and Service. Here in Vegas there was some style but not a lot of Luxury and Service. The small (Standard) rooms had no bath robes and no dressers. Lazy. And they had mini-blinds. Lazy. Not even a small ipod\/iphone speaker connection or music on the t.v. We were shocked that in a ""new"" hotel they wouldn't have simple conveniences such as this. Also the wi-fi didn't work for either of us during our stay. Lazy.

Housekeeping took hours to bring us extra pillows when we called. Lazy. The staff was not overly friendly. Lazy. And they don't even know your room number (let alone your name) when you call down. With no line it takes about 20 minutes to get your car from valet, and you can't call down to have your car pulled up. The valet is very disorganized, when we first arrived to check-in we weren't directed properly, and we had to get out of our car and start unloading in the cold before we were approached by anyone (it wasn't even busy). Lazy.

Finally, on NYE around 1 A.M. there was a man puking on the floor in the middle of 800 Degrees (pizza joint). It took security more than a half hour before he was relocated. Lazy. I do empathize with any staff working on a night like NYE, as I'm sure this was not the first or even the second incident like this that night. However patrons were leaving and we took our pizza to-go because it ruined our meal. The SLS staff needs to have procedures\/protocols when incidents like this happen. I can tell you that Cosmo and Aria wouldn't have allowed someone to vomit for 30 minutes in the middle of one of their restaurants.

As we stepped out of the bright contemporary well lit entry we hit an immediate disconnect on the casino floor. It looked like they ran out of money for the casino. The pipes and conduit are exposed like an old warehouse painted black with the ceilings which makes it look like you stepped into some seedy old dance club in NY.

As we wandered around looking for games, we discovered a tiny casino floor with limited gaming options and horror.....NO POKER room. WTH!? Restaurants were trendy and cool looking with the exception of the odd ""Griddle"" coffee shop. We did not eat in any of them nor had any inclination to do so after touring this odd place.

Another strange addition was the staff uniforms. The security were dressed in ""forever plaid"" dorky jackets that made them look more like a barbershop quartet than anything called security. The ""monkey"" outfits that the dealers wore were some kind of bizarre joke and it must feel a bit sad to have to wear that joke all day.

All in all, a very big disappointment. The vibe is bizarre and is definitely NOT a place I want to hang at. I can't believe the elite owners from Beverly Hills took such a gigantic misstep. Sadly, this place of long ago grandeur adds nothing to the sad north end of the strip. Still looking forward to new development to transform this seedy area.It is pitiful that the famous SLS Beverly Hills group will not be the one(s) to do it.",5,3,0

With the opening being a week ago I wanted to see how the SLS looked internally. I had high hopes since the newly renovated outside turned he old casino into some eye can't for this area. What I didn't like:

-the parking garage. The elevators were already not working on a busy holiday weekend. I understand this could happen but they didn't have any signs up and others like myself were standing there for a few minutes wondering what the deal was. We told a well dressed employee near the entrance and he replied ""yea no kidding"" ( a real jerk-off)! I mentioned it to a bellhop and he made the effort of alerting management. We left a few hours later and still no signs withs guests waiting on different floors for the elevator.

- we tried several time to get a players card on the gaming floor. There were no employees behind the customer service counter so you had to find someone with a hand held roaming the casino. After asking a few times we were pointed in the direction of a woman who could help. Within a few minutes and some information we had a card. They seem to have too many employees standing near entrances to greet you upon arrival and no one in between.

- I would hope they serve drinks to the gaming patrons. I personally didn't see any cocktail waitresses during my time there. It was busy and I understand t takes time to get a drink but I literally so no such person

Outside of a few restaurants I want to try I don't see the need to come back. I hope they do well since this is an area of town that needs a boost but just not a good first impression for me.",14,6,4

I was excited to stay here as the SLS in Los Angeles is a very nice place. Please be warned, while the Los Angeles location is 5-stars, this location is only 3 (and probably should be 2).

Check-in went relatively smooth, but it was all downhill from there. When my co-worker and I entered our room, we immediately felt like we were in a dorm room with our tiny beds right next to each other. If you think you MAY want to share your bed with someone on your stay, think again because that arrangement will likely take you back to your childhood.

There were a few other shocking things about our room...for what should have been a nice hotel, we did not receive ANY wash cloths. Are we expected to just smear body wash around and call that clean? Ew! I realized the missing wash cloths just as I was about to shower, too late to call house keeping for them. I asked other coworkers if they had wash cloths and half of them said no. The only things in the bathroom were 3 bath towels, 2 hand towels, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. No shower cap. No floor mat for in front of the shower. Even MOTEL 6 offers these. To top it off, there was an 18"" long dark curly hair stuck to the ceiling in the shower. Lazy cleaning.

The moment we tried to go to sleep seemed to be the same moment the pool party started. Even though we were on the 8th floor, and down the hall from the pool area, it sounded like the music was being pumped directly into our room. It was unbelievable how loud the music was in our room despite our distance from the party. And this wasn't music you could tune out, the volume kept changing, and the bass vibrated through my mattress. Impossible to sleep. Tried calling the front desk and sat on hold for 20 mins until I hung up and went to the front desk in my pajamas. Here is where the real fun begins!

The woman who was supposed to help us at the front desk had CRAZY attitude. She didn't even acknowledge we were in our pajamas, clearly uncomfortable in our situation. When I told her I had tried to call the front desk, she said ""well we don't answer the phones at the front desk, its probably just ringing in the back"" like I should have known that calling the front desk doesn't go to the front desk...

We explained we were here for work and that we could NOT sleep, was there anything she could do to help us. She spent all of 5 seconds pulling up the 3 available rooms she had that were on lower floors, clearly not a solution. She said nothing else was available and so just to clarify i had exhausted all possible solutions i asked, ""so we're basically screwed then?"" and she replied ""YEP.""
WHOA...
Realizing I wasn't going to get anywhere with her, I asked politely if there was a manager I could speak to. Her response? ""Why?""
WHOA!!! 
Why? Why do you THINK lady?! Because your customer service is terrible.

We eventually got her to call housekeeping and send up some ear plugs. I told the nice man from house keeping what had happened and he directed me to speak to a manager, which I did. Marisa was much nicer and listened to what had happened, and supposedly locating the rude employee. I hope she was dismissed as she should never be working in customer service again. Marisa was nice but I still had to be the one to try to find a solution to our problem. She explained the hotel was full, but when we asked if we could PAY for a better room, she was able to find us one for our next night, free of upcharge. This was okay but I was a little annoyed I was the only one trying to figure out a solution. The one they came up with was to LOWER (not remove) the resort fees. Um thanks but that benefits my company's bill, not my personal stay in any way. 

We used our earplugs but couldn't sleep til the party had ended after 1am. This whole snaffu started at 9pm. If I had been here for pleasure I would have left the hotel to stay somewhere else. I spent over an hour on the telephone alone.

Eventually, after multiple confusions about the change in room the next day, we finally got a quieter room. This room was cleaner, had the expected bathroom amenities like a floor mat, wash cloths and even a shower cap...(sarcasm) but the effort it took to be able to sleep in my hotel room was not worth it. 

Also, there was a mirror on the ceiling giving me a view of my co-workers' bed. EW!!! What is the purpose of that?

To top off the professionalism of the staff, we were ignored by the bellman and the valet tried to put some girl running late to airport in our cab after we had been waiting for 20 minutes. How does her problem become mine?

The decor looks cool and nice...if you have your beer goggles on. If you want a trendy hotel, try the Cosmo. Not only would I never stay here again, I would go out of my way to warn my friends and co-workers. If you're looking for a deal, I had a much better experience at the Residence Inn!!

We got an offer in the mail for 2 complimentary night and 50$ food and beverage credit. Stayed here two nights and was very impressed. 
Checking in was a breeze, and the gentleman that checked us in was extremely nice and welcoming. 
The room was great! Stayed in the world tower, and I did not think it was that small. It was a cozy size, with a large king comfy bed! Very beautifully and modernly decorated with a bunch of mirrors (lol)! The shower was large, and had great water pressure. Upon entering our bathroom was stocked with shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and soap. But we called in for more and they brought also mouth wash and lotion ( big size)! 
The amenities at the hotel were good, the pool was nice size and an average amount of seating area around the pool. The workers and security at the pool were also very nice. 
The one negative i.e the one star loss is the location. Be aware this is not close to the center of the strip and you will need to drive there or take the monorail there, which costs money.

I will give them a couple points for a quick and easy check-in, easy parking, as well as their location on the Strip (it's a bit further north, but not too far from all the action) and general hotel cleanliness. But aside from that....

We (party of 4) arrived to our room to find that SLS's definition of a ""double bed"" was a dingy full-size bed barely bigger than a twin. I'm small in stature so I didn't find it to be that much of an issue, but I could immediately see that it could pose problems to many others. 

We immediately noticed that the room's artwork and decor was also very, very strange. The ceilings were gray and looked like they had been taken from a prison cell, not to mention that there were also red paint splatters across the ceiling - I am assuming they were going for a vibe of ""abstract art"" but to be honest it just looked like splatters of blood. Creepy. Don't get me started on the yellow walls. Yellow yellow yellow everywhere. The entire bathroom was yellow. Did I mention how yellow it was?!?!

I also have many things to say about the bathroom while we're on that topic... Our room's bathroom door was a giant mirror (good) that also happened to be a sliding door (bad!!). When you opened the bathroom door, you would obstruct the sink. So, someone who happened to be coming out of the shower, for instance, would open the door only to SMACK! the person who is standing at the sink brushing their teeth. WHAT. AN. INCONVENIENCE. I got hit multiple times as a result of this; luckily by the second day of our stay, our group established a communication system to avoid this problem....a problem which shouldn't even be happening in the first place! Mega disappointment. My one more gripe about the bathroom is about its lack of storage space - only one towel rack, one hook, and no storage space at the sink except for two small shelves underneath. The sink area also flooded every time it was used because it was so small. 

Lastly, a word on their customer service - everything went well until check-out. We opened our room charges statement to find out that we had been charged for 2 items at the mini-bar (plus tax) that we didn't even open! Fair warning: the boxes of goodies at the mini-bar have SENSORS that will go off if you even just PICK UP the box - you don't even have to open it to trigger the sensor. I had phoned Guest Services THREE times before someone finally came to our room to check everything out. In my opinion this was completely unnecessary and an attempt to rip us off and take more of our money. 

TL;DR: Had an incredibly mediocre experience here. After being in our hotel room for about 12 hours, I was already sick of it. Luckily, we got a deal on Hotwire for this place, but I have to say that the Hotwire price wasn't even worth it either. Stay somewhere else!",3,2,2

Aside from that other things to note about this hotel:
It's about a $10-12 uber ride to strip so quite far and inconvenient unless you want to be closer to downtown. Rooms are small and reminiscent of my dorm room. No coffeemaker and you definitely don't want to use their cheap toiletries -only 1 bar of soap.  No late night spots open after hours for munchies so make sure you don't come hungry. Definitely not swanky like the LA SLS so don't expect the same luxuries. Towels are dingy Gray- not white. I don't even think this hotel deserves to be in the SPG family. I'd rate this as a category 1 ... lacks any of the polished customer service I typically am greeted with by SPG. not worth the low rates.",0,0,0

Few things here. 
1. CAFFEINE SUPPLY FAIL. My friend and I both got latte that cost almost $ 6 a cup at Perq,  and both poured it away after few sips, that's how bad it was. I also got a cup of coffee at casino floor,  and it tasted like dishwasher water. If you want your customers gamble all night,  please improve your coffee.  How hard it could be  to make good coffee with your thousand dollars espresso machines? I don't understand. 

2. NO direction signs in the parking structure AT ALL. We self parked and had to drag and carry our luggage through lots of steps and the whole casino to finally get to the registration. ( how can disabled people even get into this casino?) Then finally figured out there's actually a closer entrance. How we're supposed to know if there's no signs? Didn't appreciate the opportunity of upper body workout. 

3. Overwhelming perfume in the hotel.  I started to have a headache because of it just when I was waiting to check in.  This is no Abercrombie. Please tone it down. 

4. The room is tiny. I thought I was in Tokyo,  but this is Vegas! You are supposed to be able to jump around in your room. They have this setting that the sink and mirror is behind the sliding door of bathroom when it's open. So when my friend and I were getting ready for clubbing. We had to make announcements when one of us needs to go in or out the bathroom,  in case we slam the door into each other and get half face bruised. Also,  you get two double beds instead of Queen beds. 

The only two things I like about this hotel is the French toast at their Cafe is very yummy. And the slot machines do seem a bit loose. But if you are making me have to go out to get Starbucks with hangover,  then I am not coming back to this place.",0,0,0

Well let's start with I have stayed at the one in LA even though I am a local and enjoyed the experience and service completely. At the time it was also affiliated with Starwood and with my Platinum status I get 7pm check out. 

I also have a SBE preferred partner card which is great in LA as you get a small discount on purchases at SBE locations. 

The SLS Hotel and Casino looks great. They really did a great job renovating what was a dump before and did so at a reasonable price I want to say in the $600 million range which in Vegas terms is cheap. 

The staff of the SLS is great and all really do try to provide a great guest experience which is tough for a new property which was only open for 2 months when I stayed there in Oct. 

Many of the issues with this hotel are not the staffs fault. It is more issues with the design or backend operations of the hotel.

I stayed in the world tower. Which is the middle option of the 3 tiers of rooms. They room, while nicely designed has a huge flaw for any hotel especially one in Vegas. The blackout curtains do not black out the light. It creeps in around all of the edges as it is a roll down shade with a image on it that sits inside the windowsill rather than extending beyond the size of the window. 

Also there were issues in charging items to the room from the snack shop and one of the restaurants. This seems to be more related to backend computer issues   

Upon checking out the wait was long and I over heard 1 person say he just went to the room he checked into to find others in it and another guy said his room was trashed. Once again not the staffs fault as the computer systems should not allow them to check someone into a room that is occupied and there has to be a way for housekeeping to signal that a room is ready for a new guest.  

Additionally my preferred partners card was useless in this Sbe location. While I know that they stopped issuing these cards you would assume they would work at at Sbe property.  

Once again the staff was great. They really were and I found it to be on par for what I expect out of Sbe for the restaurant and hotel side. 

While their rates are great for the room and I am sure that some of the operational issues will resolve shortly the blackout curtains is a huge drawback for me. Even if I wasn't in Vegas and out late night, not that that would happen I would still not want sunlight beaming into the room onto the bed from the window located as the headboard.",3,0,0

Randomly decided last minute to celebrate my birthday weekend and of course Labor Day (in addition to SLS's Grand Opening) in Vegas, we figured that we would give SLS a try. After all, SLS in West LA is amazing! However, we have a slightly different feel about this hotel after this visit. We'll break this down to help you understand some good things and the bad (unfortunately, they have more issues than positives). 

The Good

- Rate was cheap for the grand opening during Labor Day vs where we normally stay (e.g Aria, Wynn) 
- Traffic getting around in that area is light since it's roughly a mile away from Wynn 
- Some of the staff were really nice and greeted you with a smile
- Comfortable bed 

The Bad 

- Called guest services and was on hold for over 5 minutes. They have this repeated message that states how someone will be with me shortly. I just hung up
- Valet is a sad excuse of valet parking. I don't blame the workers as they were running and some where standing there. This is an operations issue and constraint. We had to wait several minutes but we tipped anyways even though tips should be service-based. Better service = greater tips. One or two guys running to get each car while some wait around doesn't seem very efficient when you have several people waiting for cars
- Lack of taxis - If you need to go to another hotel, expect to wait for taxis. They don't come here often and it's a waiting game. 
- Room charge - be sure to check it fully for each person. We found that we were charged over a hundred dollars for some room charge. If we didn't question it, it would have stuck so be sure to check upon check out
- Working out - small gym as expected. Imagine a very nice city hotel gym and that's what you get. Not like Venetian, Wynn, or Aria's gyms. When I got there, there were no towels. I asked for some and one person told the other person, who then told me that they are out right now. No ""we're sorry let us get one for you now,"" just ""we're out right now."" 
- Hotel elevators in the hotel is much slower than I'm used to. Maybe for this particular hotel, it's okay. But the end-user experience for me was that I waited too long and is not what I'm used to when going to other hotels in the area
- Parking garage elevators are another story. We were valeting it but as mentioned, it was taking too long and had to get to our dinner reservations so we mitigated our risk by parking ourselves. It was full so we had to go to the very top on the 6th floor. Guess what happened next? ELEVATOR WAS BROKEN! So we walked in the nice 100 degree heat and then went up to our room to change\/freshen up for dinner. Hoping that the elevator would have been fixed, we go back but naturally, it's still down. They should have at least let us know as guests and did something for us for our troubles 
- If someone smokes in the room hallways, you'll smell it. Ventilation is not the best and random statement, when we checked out at 11am, there were 2 condoms in the hallway. Good times. 
- Design was a bit gloomy. Walking around in the casino floor, we did a full circle in a couple of minutes. It's small and wasn't the wow factor we were looking for. 
- Attracting the medium-income families, this hotel should not charge Wynn rates. Instead, it should charge Tropicana or NYNY rates. When we walked to the gym, we saw the VIP area and it didn't look like one. 
- Not a lot of shopping so you don't get that overall resort feeling like you do with some of the major players 

The Conclusion

Overall, it's disappointing that SLS cut corners with this release. From the blanket responses on Yelp! (from SLS management), angered customers, and to the issues mentioned above, we'll likely never stay here again. They are ruining their brand image right now and it's sad to see. If you are used to staying at a quality run resort, you should stay away from here. Again, this hotel would be great the way it is if it was in LA or some other city. Not in Vegas.",5,1,0

I also wanted to share my experience with my fellow co-workers. I love to take pictures so went there for that mostly.  First of all, the old run down parking garage is still there you enter the same way off Paradise.  You walk in thru the same entrance.  It is laid out exactly the same, just remodeled.  It's so small and they want it to be so upscale it's scarry.  I was there maybe ten minutes and started taking pictures and security was all over me telling me I can't take pictures of the gaming area.  I told them I'm taking artistic pictures.  I can't help it that it's so small in there you can't help but get some casino in most shots.  They kept there eye on me and made me feel so uncomfortable.  I would NEVER go back there.

The whole ambiance of the lobby and gaming experience has the look of luxury. The staff was extremely polite and at the crap tables they were very professional and even explained how a game is played. The only thing that bothers me about this casino, is that the location is on the north end of the strip. Yes I believe it's off the beaten path because I didn't see a lot of foot traffic. Maybe it was because I was here in the off season, I don't know but I do believe this casino has some greatness coming. As the area grows or maybe during the summer the traffic will pick up.

It's clean and most of the staff is friendly enough, the casino is awesome and the pit bosses for the paigow tables were more than helpful. The comps flowed freely, whatever I asked for they gave me, admittedly I only asked for packs of cigarettes but they gave them with no problem, the tables are cheap also, 10$ paigow is almost impossible to find on the strip and un heard of at a clean ""new"" place. The ambiance is nice too, they pump music into the casino Whig is a nice alternative to the sound of slot machines and the normal casino din. If I was writing a review on just the casino I would give 5 stars. Unfortunately I stayed here

The hotel rooms are embarrassingly small and the layout of our room was a bit funky, the bed was smack in the middle of the room and the bathroom or what you could call a bathroom is behind the bed, the bathroom is behind what looks like a mirror closet with sliding doors that conceal the toilet room, the shower and the sink. Since the doors were of the sliding closet door type (cheap) they did not seal the shower room as well as a regular door, this means the shower will leak water to the carpet and the entire room would stink if you had to have a #2. Not a good design

The entire establishment is designed toward the hipster crowd in a major way, none of the restaurants have normal Vegas hours ( 24 hours or late) most of them are closed during the week and room service is extremely expensive, we paid 47 bucks for a tiny 7"" pizza and two 12 ounce cans of Pepsi.

Would I go back? Well maybe if it was cheap, but I would not pay premium prices to stay here.",2,0,0

Day 1 we were placed on an all smoking floor even though we specified non. The attendant teased us with a free upgrade but instead said nothing could be done until the next day because the hotel was fully booked. Which we understand can happen so we endured one night.

The next day we were moved to another equivalent room that was non smoking but constantly had television issues that caused it to freeze every 10 minutes unless you changed channels. We asked them several times to fix and they sent an attendant up but still weren't able to fix the issue. They did give us 2 free drink tickets and covered one day of resort fees for our 4 day stay saving just above $32. On top of this, the room was missing basic accommodations including a hair dryer and enough towels for two (1 large towel and 3 hand towels). On top of this we were charged for items that we took from the mini bar which we never actually took or touched. These are all pretty minor things in the long run however when going to what I consider an upscale hotel I expect an excellent level of service. All we received were a few half hearted apologies and a couple drinks. No room upgrades were offered, nothing and for $400 a night I expected much much more. 

I definitely expected at minimum a room upgrade for our troubles or at least a credit back of some kind but unless SLS were to contact us and give us a good reason we probably would never stay here again which is a shame as close as it is to the convention center. 

I would give it a 1 star but I really do like the ambience of the hotel so I bumped it to a 2.",0,1,0

There was a 50% off sale offered by the website so we thought we were getting a great deal. My reservation was for the story metropolitan tower with a king bed. I paid $276 up front and was quoted a $145 resort fee due at check-in. When I arrived i was actually given a room with a queen bed in the world tower. I was also charged $168 in resort fees at check out. I didn't realize I wasn't given what I was actually promised because I never bothered to look at the reservation again until I got home. The phrase BAIT AND SWITCH comes to mind.

A fake flower without the fragrance. That's the best way I can describe the SLS. It's pretty but not functional. There were no (standard) microwaves or refrigerators in the room. There was no dresser and minimal closest space so we were forced to live out of our suitcases. Adding insult to injury, our room was only cleaned twice through the course of a five night stay. The second time I had to go and request to have the room cleaned. We were out all day and returned around 2pm. We were in the room until 5pm and there wasn't a maid in sight. So I stopped by the front desk on the way out to request that the room be cleaned. That's unacceptable. There's no reason any guest should have to ask for the room to be cleaned. Nor should a guest go two days without having the room cleaned. 

The hotel is also really far away from the more populated end of the strip. We saved on the cost of the room but ended up spending nearly $125 in lyft and cab rides. All the shows we attended were at Planet Hollywood, Mandalay Bay and Caesars. In retrospect, it would have been better to pay more for a hotel in the middle of the strip in order to have the ability to walk vs taking cabs. I didn't visit the restaurants in the hotel as I wasn't overly impressed with the menu selections. I did grab a fruit platter to go from Perq that was extremely overpriced at $11. 

The hotel is pretty but other than that it doesn't have much to offer. As the old saying goes, beauty is only skin deep....  After awhile you've got to have something else to offer. Several of my lyft drivers told me that SLS would be closing in August as it wasn't performing well. This fact doesn't surprise me at all. I'm not sure I'd stay there again if you paid me.

He thought he was being a funny guy but his comments were brash from the moment I sat down. Was he trying to be sarcastic-funny or insulting? I wasn't sure what to make of it but I was sure that he hated his life. I quickly cashed out and got out of there. It's unfortunate that their service is so poor when this place looks like it would be white glove.

I recently took a short midweek trip with my nieces. We had a car and self parking was convenient and never crowded. +. The garage was also very close to the entrance and registration. Major +. The tower in which our room was located was also right next to the entrance closest to the garage and the registration counter. +++. This really made coming and going so much easier and stress free. So many times I have had to cross entire casinos to get to the elevator banks and am turned upside down searching for the garage. Having this convenience was a true honest to God lifesaver. 

The rooms are beautiful yet small. Someone had left 2 glasses outside our door on the ground prior to our arrival, and for the entire 3 days we were there, housekeeping never cleaned it up. In fact, housekeeping never cleaned our room at all. Strange. 

Some of the guests were a little less mature than I was used to but it was fine. We were not in the hotel much and for the price, it suited our needs fine.

The hotel was developed by one of the richest families in Los Angeles. Sam Nazarian the son of Qualcomm founder Younes Nazarian developed the hotel. I am from Orange County and the Beverly Hills location is 100x superior to this hotel. The pool
and bar scene are not the same compared to the Beverly Hills location. I stayed for a night because it was significantly cheaper than the palazzo for the extra night. I would say it's the best bargain on the strip if you consider price and room. The only downside is if you are a tourist it's a little further from all the touristy locations. You can always Uber or take taxis. It's walkable but just a little off the center. More convenient than staying off the strip. The bathroom in the hotel room has a window in the shower so as you shower you can see the strip. It's pretty cool. I would say for the price I paid 140 dollars with resort fees on a major weekend it was a steal. I think you can get it on off weekdays for 60 to 70 bucks plus resort fees. You can't avoid the resort fees in vegas anymore. 99 percent of the major hotels implement them. The other positive aspect is that this hotel is not part of the MGM group so parking is free. Las Vegas MGM resorts are charging parking now for all guests. I would definitely stay again, it just doesn't compare to the Wynn, Venetian or Cosmopolitan.

The bathroom and shower were behind be mirrors! The hotel also has a mirror on the ceiling and an interactive TV where you can find all the information you need about the hotel. My two favorite restaurants were also downstairs and we were able to order up straight to our room  ( Katsuya and Umami). The sink was a bit strange. There was no room for me to actually wash my face without splashing all over the floor lol. 

Life was also a really fun club. I heard bad things about it but I had a splendid time. The crowd was young, attractive, and full of life. Angello was performing and it was great.  

The only thing I did not like was how there was no system to play music on.. not even bluetooth via the TV . AND LOL, there is no ice available to guests on their floors. You have to call the front desk to have it delivered to you. . What kind of shit is that? The ice wait time was 30 min so my friend and I had to pregame without ice  Would definitely stay here again. It was only 72 bucks. It is probably difficult for SLS to get more guests because it is pretty far down the strip. But who cares if it is a really nice hotel and you're planning on going to Life anyway. Can't wait to check out the other nightlife and daylife scenes there.

The general vibe of this hotel is young, swanky, and luxurious.  From complementary valet, to the bell service, and the on point reservation desk, you'll feel like a high stakes roller.  The room designs are fashion forward and modern.  The casino is clean and well ventilated.  Central Bar has really friendly and talented staff with well made affordable drinks.

Our stay was on a Sunday night just before the ""on season"", so we weren't able to enjoy the stereotypical Vegas experience, however, considering how much fun we had on a slow night gives much to SLS's credit.

It's not conveniently located on the strip (neighbors Stratosphere), but it is right across from the monorail.  The monorail is a lot cheaper than a cab and provides some much needed foot recovery time.",1,0,0

We stayed here one night. Check in was smooth and the lady helping us was very friendly.  She placed us on a higher level floor which was nice.  The rooms are small, which I don't mind but I can see how that can bother other people. The TV was huge! Lighted mirrors were a nice touch. The pool was very cute!  The in room decor is different, so if you prefer traditional Vegas this hotel maybe not for you.

I rate my hotels in a couple ways -  how well I sleep and the heating\/cooling system. Although the floor was quiet (we did not hear any neighbors), the out door noise came through the window, even on the 27th floor. We would hear cars burning out, people yelling, etc. throughout the night. The windows were super old or thin.  On top of that the cooling system was LOUD. It would wake us up everytime it went off during the night.  My sleep for that one night was terrible.

So, just for those reasons I would not stay here again. I would visit for the restaurants and entertainment.  This hotel is also not very close to other hotels or the main part of the strip so that is also a factor in staying here again.  

Bottom l line pretty cool to visit but not an overnight stay.",5,2,2

First off the hotel i liked the glowing lights upon the floor as you walk in from the valet, but what do those lights have nothing to do with anything else in the hotel? there is no theme to the hotel. 
They obviously forgot it was Las Vegas and made it like LA. 

the security wears plaid uniforms... theres ducks and monkeys as there mascots lil animals as decorative stickers on the glass and doors. 

Now lets get to the good stuff. 
there furniture looks like it was from IKEA. 
Instead of putting wall paper they put decorative curtain around the room walls. 

The phones didn't work in the rooms as well as the toilets. 
seems like they tried making this hotel very cheaply. 
besides all that all weekend all i heard were complaints. 
from sitting in the vip to going over to the front desk to waiting for an elevator which made the hotel even more less attractive. 
on top of all that. 
they don't even have good desert for room service. 
this hotel literally might be worst than flamingo and no offense to them i have never even been there. 
i really wish SLS took more time to figure out what there goal was in making an SLS in vegas because vegas is no joke and this hotel is.",17,5,2

The rooms are tiny and the room we had had no window!!! Um.... I really would like the description to say when I book: may not have window. So the gray walls of a small room with no windows made this place seems like a dungeon.

Now there are mirrors everywhere and mood lighting for the sofa and the couch-- so apparently I'm in a sex dungeon. 

Staff are rude, things are not working in the room, and the room is dirty. We found black lace thong on the floor when we lifted the mattress and you can see a layer of dust in all the corners. 

Perhaps this is meant to represent a hip urban loft but it just freaked me out with how small, dark and unclean it is. I should've known better when I see the etch on the glass windows to be a monkey on a chandelier. Yes it's cheap but no thank you, I'd rather pay twice the amount and stay somewhere else.

Staff: The dealers at the tables were very friendly and welcoming. I agree with other reviewers that there are way too many employees standing around doing nothing but chatting with one another. We walked around and saw groups of 3 or more employees just leaning against the wall talking. Other than the dealers no other staff member said hello or went out of their way to acknowledge guests and seemed engrossed in their own conversations. 

Cleanliness: The amount of trash and dirt was astounding. The carpets were covered with cigarette ash and bits of junk. Either they don't have enough people cleaning or they don't seem to care to clean up. Maybe the staff that just stand around talking could take pride in their own establishment and pitch in. There were half empty glasses left out in the bars from the night before. Walking around and seeing that the bars left dirty things overnight was such a turnoff. The bathrooms had toilet paper strewn about all over the floor and the trash was piled high in the baskets. Plus the janitorial staff left piles of plastic bags of trash outside the bathroom entrance. 

The Griddle: We went here for breakfast and had to wait over 15 minutes to be seated when 2\/3 of tables were empty. The line of people outside couldn't stop complaining about how poorly the 4 (yes, 4) hostesses were handling the seating. When asked about the hold-up their response was that the staff was going through a shift change.    After being seated it took a few minutes before anyone came by with water. Then, it took a few more minutes before our server came by. Another server brought someone else's food to our table and then my boyfriend's meal was brought first and it took over 5 more minutes for my food to come out. When we finished our meal about an hour later and walked out of the restaurant at about 9am the line to get in went around the corner and the staff must still have been going through a shift change because there were loads of empty tables inside. 

Spa: We wanted to check out the spa but an unfriendly guard brusquely told us that only guests can go to the spa. I don't know how the spa will do if their only clientele comes from the hotel. You would think that they would want more business. All the other spas on the strip welcome outside guests.

There is a sign for Taxis to the right and Valet on the left, yet when I parked my car on the left, the three valets just stood on the curb talking and didn't approach my car.  I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do, so I just left and used self parking.  When I entered through the front entrance, I saw another car waiting in the same location I had and the three valets talking and not helping.  So this wasn't my mistake, there was no help or clarity on the front entrance procedure.

Next, there is no information when you enter the casino from the front.  Registration is nowhere near the front entrance, yet there are no immediate signs nor doorman to assist. Frustrating, especially when you have bags.

Front desk was more interested in looking at a computer screen than actually welcoming me to the hotel.  She seemed confused by the whole procedure.  Other than a bar waitress (who was fantasitic) she was the only interaction I had with hotel staff.

There is way too much going on in the room decor for it to be very relaxing.  The entire hotel suffers from overuse of mirrors and the decor is trying to hard to be ""hip"".  Never forget, less is more.  For example, the desk with the Las Vegas map, was a great style piece (one thing to talk about), one giant mirror would have been more than enough, and the Woodstock window blind was just ridiculous, it felt like there were strangers in my room.

With that said, I must also note the racial undertones I also noticed. While standing at the front desk, i noticed the video picture wall behind the desk ans all the pictures flashed across it. I also noticed the lack of diversity in those pictures, but what was disturbing to me is that they had pictures of bodies  with a framed head that included a monkey in that frame.

When i turned to asked my companion what he thought of the depiction, i looked over his shoulder and saw ""The Monkey Bar"". I thouth that was suspect, but went on to my room.  Once in the room i pulled down the window shade and saw whatblooked like a skinhead rally depicted on the shade!! At this point i became extremely disturbed and uncomfortable. I went downstair to ask what the premise was for the decorations. There was an african american security guard standing in the lobby. I asked him about the decor, he said that he was told by management that ""monkeys represent fun"".

There was hardly anyone in the casino. I did not have a gun on me (my permit is waiting to be approved) taser or pepper spray and was outnumbered 2-1. Both guys were bigger than me with a ""ain't got nothing to lose"" vibe. I did a u turn back into the casino. They started to follow me but stopped once they saw I was ""running"" from them and said ""aww s--t man"". 

Nothing special about this place compared to the rest of the strip.

Also - I Lost 20 hands of blackjack which is almost unheard of. The probablity of this very low.  I do know I did not see the cards  shuffled. I noticed they are splaying the cards on the table - which are then put into the shoe. HOWEVER you never see them shuffle. This happens on a new deck only with an empty table. Also SLS is 600 million in debt. I think the gaming commision needs to do some stings on SLS and other casinos because they are doing this at the other casinos too. When you ask to shuffle they act as if you are accusing them and say they already did and argue and refuse. I even had a pit boss at the Mandalay Bay... have the audacity to refuse to shuffle the cards in front of me and said if I did not like it I could leave. 

Make sure you insist they shuffle in front of you and leave if they refuse. 


This casino used to be the Sahara. Boy did they make a mistake turning it into the SLS. The Sahara was great. The SLS stinks. The Sahara was a profitable busy casino and hotel. I believe Elvis used to stay there. They had a good thing going already and should have modernized the Sahara. Make it modern yet keep the history alive kind of thing. Big mistake turning Sahara int the SLS. Sahara was always busy and popular every time I was there. 

Staff was sparse. Did not see too much security. You've got these homeless drug addict criminal looking guys prowling the casino watching the patrons and following them outside. I complianed to security about this. It's so obvious these guys have no business being there and are prowling for victims.

Most of the well dressed looking crowd was clumped up in a small bar near the monorail entrance. It was almost like they were avoiding the casino floor. Perhaps secutiry needs to do thier job better. Clearly they are alseep on the job or don't know what the hell they are doing.

For starters, the hotel is a poor remodel with small rooms and small windows.  We stayed for 5 days and the maid never showed up (we did not have the DND sign on our door either).  We had to call and request maid service every day when we got back to our room around5\/6 ish.  The first morning we were there I went upstairs to get something out of my room and as I'm stepping onto the elevator the whole elevator and entire floor went pitch black due to a power outage.  I was stuck on the 27th floor for almost an hour.  When we mentioned the scary experience to the front desk they just shrugged it off and said the power was up now and left it at that. There was no apology and no offer to do anything for the experience (not that I'm expecting a lot, but a small gesture would have been nice).  Then 4 days into our stay they locked us out of the room because I guess instead of putting a hold on the card for the whole stay when we arrived ( and as they said they were), they tried to charge our card again 3 days into our stay and it failed for fraud alert.  But instead of calling us, they just locked us out, to our surprise.  Again, no consolation offered for this, not even an apology.  When we finally asked to speak to a manager about our overall horrible experience, she offered to take off one night of tax and resort fees.  For a 5 night stay that wasn't much of a consolation.  And that's just the service...

The hotel pool is lack luster to say the least with only 8 chairs that have a little shade (of course all were taken every day, so I never got to lay by the pool over a 5 day stay).  They have a rooftop pool (apparently) but that wasn't open. They have one crummy bar area In the middle of a small casino and one tiny bar (like the ones in airports) directly across from check in.  There is one good restaurant, but don't expect a selection of food places.

It is so accessible. You don't have to deal with the over crowded side show that is the Las Vegas strip.
The other thing that I love about it is that it's a smaller hotel. If I make a plan to meet someone here, I can actually find them. 
A girl can also survive a night in a most uncomfortable pair of. shoes. We know that fashion is always more importable than comfort. Now you can have both.

The restaurants will provide you with meals and libations worthy of your last meal on earth, while the staff will treat you like royalty. At Bazaar Meat and Katsuya- they actually great me by name. They remember, because they care. Cleo is also magical, I've only been there once, but I will be going back- ALOT! The prices are very reasonable and the staff was so knowledgable and they really cared about my dining experience. 
I also love the griddle cafe- best bacon ever. EVER.
You can see my reviews about the individual restaurants on their yelp pages.

The design is warm, modern and has a sense of humor. 
It's a happy and very friendly place.

I've spent the night there - a staycation! They way the room was lit was really cool, the light is generated from behind the mirrors. With plenty of lamps as well to set what ever mood you want.
The TV menu was easy to use and had all the restaurant menus on there. You can surf all the food porn before you go eat.

How was the bed, you ask?
IT WAS THE MOST COMFORTABLE THING MY BODY EVER TOUCHED- ESPECIALLY THE PILLOWS.
OMG. I normally have to ask for extra pillows, but there were like clouds dropped from the heavens. 
If they are available to purchase, I will OH P,EASE GOD LET THEM BE I NEED JUST ONE KING SIZE CLOUD- I mean PILLOW.

The last time I had friends in town, I don't want to name names, but this hotel starts with C and rhymes with frogsmapolitan , we had reservations for Rose.Rabbit.Lie. And I had read about a locals promotion as well. 
We walk up to the counter I asked about the promotion, four people standing there had no idea what I was talking about. They then looked us up and down and they told us that they would not let us in because of our shoes.

THAT JUDGMENTAL BEHAVIOR WOULD NEVER HAPPEN HERE.

Style, luxury' service. They want to make you happy.

Follow the SLS on facebook or instagram, they have amazing promotions for locals only- like they have been doing 50% off at their restaurants on Sunday nights- a different one every Sunday. That is a like the greatest present ever- unlike socks and underpants on Christmas.

This place is a foodies dream, as well as any person who likes to be cared for and feel special.

Oh, and the last thing-
It smells soooooo good when you walk in, like freshness, warmth and something new and indescribable.

Before we arrived - I reached out to the hotel to get confirmation on incidentals and daily fees & Trina was super helpful. She answered all of my questions, was incredibly polite, and so helpful! Right on arrival Dom took care of checking us in and it took no time at all. We appreciate speedy and helpful service!! Kudos to them both!! 

Our room was beautiful - we stayed in the Lux Tower on the 22nd floor. Non-smoking suite and we had a view of the Rock in Rio grounds and it was so awesome! The beds are really comfortable and we LOVED the decor of the room. We ordered room service our first day. The food was fresh.. but, the fees on top of the actual price of the food cost as much as 1 of our meals. It may have been one of the most expensive room service meals I've ever had =\/  We definitely paid for the convenience of having it brought up to our room. 

We checked out Sayer Lounge - cool vibe. Loved the live music and the drinks were good. Very small lounge, but we enjoyed it. 

All of the staff we had encounters with were pleasant! I do hope that the SLS gains momentum. The monorail is right outside of the hotel, so you can pay $12 for unlimited rides. WAY cheaper than what you would pay for taxi rides. SO CONVENIENT. 

If we were to come back to vegas for anything on the north side of the strip.. I would OF COURSE stay at SLS. Beautiful space and polite staff! We did forget some things in our room and we called Lost and Found.. no one has called us back yet. =\/

So we get to the room, we had just walked the convention center 15 laps at the souvenir show. Really really hungry we go up to the room to drop bags and head to eat. 

The room
80s coke induced sex dungeon. Looking for the bathroom I realize the toilet is in a closet and the shower is in another closet and the sink is in between. You can't move or use the loo without making a ridiculous amount of noise, because you can't use the toilet and wash your hands without moving a huge sliding door twice. The king bed takes up all the rest of the usable space. The bed is comfy, I lay down to make sure and to my surprise there is a 7 ft mirror on the ceiling. WTF. I get it, but I thought maybe the front desk guy might have been able to tell the difference between someone that is about to go upstairs and get drunk and have wild sex all night and a professional conservatively dressed 42 yr old couple. 

The view non-existent, looking into some sort of industrial area of hotel with bright lights so we had to keep the curtains closed.  Room 11515 was the room we were in. If you, the hotel, read this, I am sure you know the room. Would this be the room you would choose for a gold member midweek on a non sold-out night?

Forgot to mention Diamond\/Gold members get free wifi at every property in the world, apparently not this one. Resort fee to cover wifi? Laughable

We weren't there long enough to complain, and my wife hates changing rooms, ask her. But as I glance at the website and view the room choices on a not sold out night like last night, I see that the room we were in was the base room in the old tower. What happened to complimentary upgrades to nicer rooms for gold members?

Should have stayed at elara, no bells and whistles but they care about their members.",9,4,0

I know it's really far down the strip but I think the modern decor and contemporary style make up for it. It reminds me of Hard Rock but less trashy.

Our stay was literally PERFECT!  Upon arrival, Tessa made our check-in easy and fun!  She set the tone for the rest of our weekend.  Never have I ever remembered a front desk agent's name as easily as I have hers.  

We had a room in the World Tower.  The room was everything we could ask for.  The infinity mirros are fun.  The bed was so COMFORTABLE!!!  

Everytime I called for any sort of service (from questions to ordering food), everyone was so kind.  The service at this hotel is TOP NOTCH - seriously.  It seemed that everyone employee I encountered at the SLS was genuine and eager to help.

I don't know who did the Decour at the SLS but they should be shot.  I don't know who's managing the SLS but they should be shot too. Upon entry there are neon lights that look like they were just hanging there half done.  I didn't understand the concept because it wasn't  executed correctly.  The carpet had some scribble on it.   We had a pretty rude waiter at the Northside Café.  Upon entering the hotel the valet guy asked me if I was here to check out the place. Normally I am greeted with welcome are so happy to have you something along those lines.   Who is running this place it's really really bad.  They need a visit from hotel impossible.   My buddy stayed here and he posted a picture of crap in the toilet that they had as they entered the room.    His name is Mike  R if you want to read his review it's really funny.  I heard they got rid of Sam are you guys crazy!!!  It wasn't luxurious and decadent like the SLS Hotel in Los Angeles. I did not stay here but after my buddies visit I wouldn't.   I would come back for bazaar.   At least they got that right but leave it open late night this is vegas a city that doesn't sleep.,1,0,0

I booked one of the high floor view suites with a view in the Lux Tower for a Sunday night. The hotel is beautiful decorates, and we instantly received great service from the Valet. The woman who checked us in was courteous, and answered all of my questions, and also gave me a $25 dining credit, and late check out since I had booked the room for a birthday. We received a coupon book, and went to pick up my The Code card. The woman at the desk was also very kind, let me know about all of the promotions and how to get the most out of my card. Our room was beautiful and was missing hand soap, but the maid services arrived within 5min. With 2 bars. While walking to dinner met a promoter for LiFE who helped us with getting on the guest list, then had a great meal and great service at Umami burger. While gambling, we met a floor man named Ron who was so much fun, and provided very great service as well. LiFE was a blast! The scene was fun, with cut out card board celebrities all over and blow up toys to play with (unicorns, bananas, cell phones, and blow up girls for the VIP tables). The dancers were beautiful and there was ample dance space which is a rare find. What a great time! 
The resort is much smaller than the bigger casinos but just as beautiful. The small size makes it easier to get around, visit all of the bars, restaurants, and casino areas, as well as it's easy on the high heels :)

The broken elevators and the crowds, definitely expected that kind of thing for opening. There are growing pains. 

What I didn't expect was the layout and design of this place. It was perfectly ""meh."" Being the first opening of a major resort and casino since I've moved here, I was excited to see what it would be like. I really didn't like the design, and left confused about how they could have spent so much money on it!

As others have mentioned, they went with some industrial\/graffiti kind of look, which I'm sorry, was just not nice to look at. The exposed roof with all the pipes and vents made me feel like I was sitting in a construction site, not a luxury casino. 

The layout of the property has to be one of the worst I've seen. I mean, talk about claustrophobic.  It was crowded, but everyone was funneled into what felt like a high school hallway. When walking around one side of this very thin path on the casino, it just ends into some slot machines which everyone was just navigating through. The entrance and front desk area was also tiny with some low ceilings. 

For a luxurious resort in Las Vegas, this place seems designed to only handle very small crowds. 

This and the fact that the whole property was pretty dirty (as others mentioned) just made it an experience that doesn't make me want to regularly come here. I also noticed they had ONE front desk agent at 10PM on a Friday on opening weekend... I couldn't believe that part, but just walked past the forming line happy I wasn't checking in.

While I enjoy LVH\/Westgate for all of my sports wagering and NFL viewing, the SLS is now where I spend my evenings for dining, drinking and socializing.

Just this past weekend, I visited two different SLS restaurants (Umami Burger and Griddle Cafe) and spent multiple nights at the bar in the center of the casino floor where some really good dudes named Chris and Jeremy kept the drinks coming and the laughs as well.

The vibe is good, the people are good looking and the entire first floor looked modern and clean. I cannot stress enough how comfortable I was from the moment I set foot inside the front door on each visit.

It would be difficult for me to recognize any employee I interacted with that was not smiling, helpful and efficient in doing their job. (Players club desk, bartenders, waitresses, hostesses, etc.) Oh, even a nice man in a suit approached me while I was gambling and asked me if I would like complimentary access to the nightclub.

Honestly, I'd love to stay at SLS just to enjoy the pool and check out the modernization of the rooms, but let's just say my ""rate"" at LVH\/Westgate is almost impossible to beat...so there will be more walks across the street in my future. Or at least until 2017 when Westgate finishes their major overhaul of the LVH.",6,1,3

The check in counter staff is sub par and probably half wits too. Not much changed from the last time where it took 30 minutes to check in one guest.

So I booked through hotels.com for a king size high floor room. That was how it was advertised. I get here and was told that my room is not available and that the rooms are reserved but you can't specify which type. Ok, then they need to talk to hotels.com because that is how they advertised it. 

Ok, whatever I waited for 10 minutes to check in already and was not going to give this idiot anymore time. So after another 20 minutes of trying to figure out my reservation we go to the room and it definitely was not two queen beds but two beds that seemed to be over sized toddler beds. She did offer to switch me out but really? No one wants to do that. 

The hotel seems to attract the weirdos too. There weren't that many last time I was here. There was a guy with a bloody forehead in the elevator with us. Nasty looking 17 year old justin bieber look alikes were out in full force. Not to mention the club scouts who approached anything that pranced around in high heels looking like they could barely walk as they tried to keep all their women parts in the three sizes too small dress

This is probably the last time I'll stay here. Sorry SLS, for trying to brand yourself, you are still really just made up Sahara. 

Your comps nights will do you no good. I'd rather spend money and be in a hotel that I know attracts less scumbags and has enough rooms to honor guests reservations.

The hotel in general has a modern and hip vibe. It is a boutique hotel, so don't expect grandeur. But it is chic and even a bit sexy.

I asked for a receipt and was told that I didn't need one since they didn't charge me.  Well it is now 9-30 and I got my business expense report and they did charge me which I figured but also expected a credit but they did not.  Called and Accounts Receivable has a recording and says leave a message and they will get back to you with in 72 hours.  This tells me they are 1 very under staffed or have a ton of issues.  My guess is it is both.  Left message and then called main number and gal tried to help me as I asked to speak with a manager.  She at least sent me a receipt and it showed that I was a ""no show"" which is incorrect but I guess they didn't want to put down that what I really said ""their rooms are cheap remodeled Motel 6's"".  The gals actually tried to help me and transferred me to front desk where I was on hold for 1 hour.  I started to explain to this gal my issue and right in the middle she cut me off and transferred me to accounts receivable.  Again a recording.  Signage is extremely poor in garage and casino.

1. I made reservations over the phone & was given a total price, including all taxes and fees (or so I thought). I was floored upon check-in that they were adding another almost $180 for the resort fees. I was pretty mad because I specifically asked if the resort fees were included in my price & was assured it was. Long story short, Kendall, the manager came to talk to me. He was very nice & offered a higher (better view) room upgrade & removed 2 of the resort fees. I agreed.
2. I also asked about a shuttle or transportation to & from the airport and was told they do not have one. Fine, a bit of a bummer but I know not all hotels offer this. Taxi it was. Come to find out they actually do have a free shuttle. Apparently the person who made my reservation had a lot to learn. 

So back to the review. I was in the World Tower & my room looked right at the Stratosphere. Great view. I saw someone mention there are no curtains. True but if you close the blinds and pull the shade down the room is almost completely black on the sunniest day so I'm not sure why that reviewer couldn't get shade. I already knew there are no dressers in the rooms & was ok with that. 

We had great service. I do leave a tip for housekeeping every day. Anywhere I stay I do & I think it makes a big difference even if just $5 or so a day. The room was clean, very comfy bed & great shower with decent pressure. I did have to get moved down on the same floor as there are apparently dead wifi spots & my first room was one of them. Normally wouldn't be a big deal but when I'm paying $30 daily for a resort fee I expect wifi to work. 

The pools were great.  It's a trade off though. The smaller, Lux pool, COULD be more relaxing than the more party like setting of Foxtail pool but children are not allowed at Foxtail so they're all at Lux. Both pools were very clean. 

There is security at the elevators. You have to give a quick flash of your key to get past.  Have it ready & smile. They'll smile back & there won't be any issues. You also have to scan your key across the outside area of the elevators before they will work. No one told me that so I'm glad I saw someone else do it first, lol. 

We ate at Northside Cafe a few times & everything there was great with equally great service. The two different pizzas we had from 800 Degrees were absolutely delicious. I love the location of SLS. It's considered on the strip (far north) but it's not in the heart of all the chaos. There's plenty of places to walk to; Walgreens, McDonalds, Carls Jr, Dennys, Subway & some souvenir shops and liquor stores. The Chinese restaurant across the street was good too. We used the Las Vegas Monorail to get around which was very convenient with a stop being right at SLS. Taxi's are VERY expensive in Vegas. 

SLS pumps a distinct air freshener throughout the entire building. My nose is very strong but I liked it. It's something very specific that sets them apart.

Upon check-out they tried to charge me for the two resort fees that Kendall removed at check-in. I told the lady & after a quick check in the system she removed it (again). I don't like feeling like I have to be so vigilant about charges. Unfortunately I don't think that's specific to SLS but rather Las Vegas in general so I am open to staying here again.",6,1,0

And to put the icing on the cake, the attendant gives me a lower level room while the diamond member before me gets a higher level room (I'm also a diamond member). Really??? Thanks dick head!  Absolutely insane! 

Upon entering the lobby, there is no clear sign that directs HHonors members to wait in a shorter, faster moving line. At first, it all looked like one line, as it was full from end to end. Shortly after, I notice a sign saying 'invited guests', and I notice there were really 2 lines, which wasn't evident at first. What the hell is an 'invited guest'??? I decide to stay polite and patient thinking there are only a few people infront of me. But, no. The lines were not moving, as the checkin process is stupid slow!

Fix your stupid signs and have a more automated checkin process.

Priceline Express Deal rate is very affordable
Relatively upscale ambience\/renovation is nice
Service was prompt
Foxtail Pool Club was free for guests
Relatively uncrowded

Cons: 
Location is far (not walking distance to the rest of the strip; this will change over time as the northern-end of the strip develops more)
The Story Tower rooms are smaller than normal hotel rooms
No ice maker in Story Tower

We stayed in the World Tower. Arrived on a Friday evening at 7pm. It took us literally a total of 15 minutes to get the car valet parked, checked in and up to our amazing Lux room. 
The room is mostly crisp white with silver trim accented with baby pink and black decor. Everything was really clean and the bath products were larger sized, very generous!
Use of the gym is included in the resort fee. Even with that fee the room rate for what we for was extremely reasonable. 
The only things I wish were different:
No all 24\/7 room service in the World Tower. Ends at 2am. That's about when I want to eat in Vegas or later! There is no time lol
And
They won't let you use the spa facilities unless you book a service. Most major hotels in Vegas will let you have day use of the ammenities with a nominal fee but not here :(...

I wouldn't know, because I never went into the old place, but I can only assume it was old and crusty. Management has done wonders, and turned the property into a classy, and modern property. Biggest potential downside is that its on the ""end"" of the strip that sorely needs more development...or redevelopment. But look at it this way - if the SLS was more centrally located on the strip, it would certainly cost many more $ per night than it did cost. So there's value, at least right now, and more nightlife\/action is just a cab ride away.

Casino looks up to date. Couldn't smell smoke (but I did smell some type of perfume they might pump in?) Everything is clean and new. Staff was friendly and efficient at check in (check in desk features animated monkey pictures which move - kinda cool). There are several restaurants on site, but many are not open until the evening, and I was disappointed the buffet was closed for the season.

My room in the ""World Tower"" was on the small side, but that is probably because the designers were constrained by the old Sahara room layout. King bed was comfy (also it was pretty new, and not used up), and had a couch at the end. The giant, lit mirrors on either side were a nice touch I might like to replicate at home, and added ambience. Bathroom was nicely designed, and the shower had fantastic shower pressure, one of my pet peeves about hotel bathrooms. Toiletries were good quality. I had a small window above my bed that looked at the top of a parking garage which was a bit of a disappointment, but not everyone can have an amazing view. It's luck of the draw in some cases. 

I ate at the Unami Burger, and the Griddle. Those will be mentioned in another review, but they are pretty solid. No real problems during the stay except a noise nuisance the first night coming from outside my window...on the 16th floor! Calling the front desk at midnight, the first person I spoke to said the music would be on till 4am (""some people come to sleep, and others to party"" she said). I was incredulous she could be right. What purpose would that volume of music serve...and I'm on the 16th floor. I asked to speak to a manager...and the first person was wrong. There was a private suite blasting music in one of the other towers. SLS comped me $25 at checkout for my troubles, which I suppose is better than nothing, and paid for a breakfast. I needed to be up early the next morning for a trade show. 

For a clean, classy, place to stay, one could do worse than consider the SLS. Shame there isn't much to do in the immediate vicinity!",3,0,0

Courtesy of her boss, we were given 3 suites at the SLS hotel. Score! From the outside, it almost gives me an LA feel. I felt like I was at home, lol. Once inside for check-in, things were going great. We were told we could request a roll away bed for our friend in one of the rooms to which we said, yes please! They told us they will have it sent to the room right away and will be there by the time we finish check in and come up to our rooms.

Once we got upstairs, there was no sign of our roll away bed even after 30 minutes so we gave front desk a call. Front desk apologized and said they will send us one immediately. Another 45 minutes passed and nothing! By this time we were tired of waiting and ready to hit the strip so we said forget it. Our room was in the Lux Tower and I was surprised at the size of our suite. Kinda small compare to other ones I've been to. I had a mixed feeling about the decor. I like how posh it looked with the white accents, but I did not enjoy the Victorian feel with the weird lady on the wall. 

Over the course of our weekend, we really didn't have any complaints. We didn't need any room service. I have to mention that during one night before we went clubbing, I ran downstairs to get a quick bite and the cafe was about to close up shop so the lady asked what I would like, to which I replied a croissant, and she gave it to me on the house. On our last day, we dined at one of the restaurants (I forgot the name) and they were extremely nice and helpful. So to speak, I think SLS has a lot of great restaurants and clubs that you can check out. However, it was after we left was when the real problem set in. All 3 parties went downstairs and checked out of 3 of the suites. The next day, 2 out of 3 of my friends found out that they had been charged about $400. We were surprised and wondered why, but decided to wait an extra couple of days to see if any of the incidental charges would fall off. After about almost a week, it still wasn't! They both had to call SLS to file a complaint and was given the run around for a while. They eventually got it resolved, but it was such a hassle to have to go through that after such a fun-filled weekend. It gives me mixed feelings about wanting to stay here again.",2,1,3

The first time I came here was near the time when they first opened. It was desolate and quiet. I came out to eat at Cleo with some of my brother's chef friends and noticed there was probably more people eating in the restaurant than in the casino. A year and half later and I've returned back and it's...a little better. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the amenities this place has and what they did to try and give a great experience for a guest staying here.

Styling - 3

When you look at the outside of the SLS it doesn't really stand out. It has modern styling to it but nothing notable; nothing Las Vegas. Walking inside and you get the strange sense they tried really hard to capture the fun and chic of the Cosmopolitan and fell short. The walls are painted black and the carpet, though ornate, is underwhelming. They have some great designs for the cafe and restaurants, which is appropriate because they tote themselves as a foodie casino, but the overall design of the hotel falls flat.

Room - 3

The rooms again fall somewhere between chic and unimpressive. The hallway to the rooms have two tones with pink and white grass like wallpaper which continues into the room. The rooms have two large mirrors on opposite sides of the wall which have bright backlighting at the touch of a button. When you turn it on it is very impressive and will be a perk for any woman who loves makeup. The office table has a weird counter top that is slightly slanted and doesn't line up with the actual table surface and if you have OCD about things aligning it will drive you crazy. The blinds shade is a strange black and white photo of young people in a crowd, most likely at a concert, but it's funny that there are only white people on it. Just an interesting observation. They also don't have a dresser to place any clothes. Instead your suitcase will have to do. Otherwise, the bathroom is on point with a huge stand in shower, a beautiful set up for the sink, and they have some of the most comfortable pillows and sheets for their beds. You can lie on the bed for a minute and knock out just as quick. For me, the room was nicely decorated but felt like a mediocre project you might've seen on an Ikea demo space.

Staff - 4

It was here I learned how to play pai gow. Again, the casino floor was very slow with maybe 100 people filling the entire space. It gave me the chance to speak with the dealers and they either had some great tips or good stories. I got to know how some of them ended up at the SLS and what people think of the place. It was great being able to speak with someone so comfortably and the experience made me prefer playing at the SLS at the end of the day.

Price - 2

I know this a brand new hotel and casino and yes, they are going for that high life but this place is too expensive. Even with discounts I ended up paying nearly $300 for 2 nights. Until they bring it down a bit I don't think most people will want to stay here, especially considering how far north it is on the Strip.

Conclusion

Overall the staff of the SLS was fantastic, the styling was somewhere between good and bad, and the pricing is too expensive. If you have your own transport the SLS isn't a bad place to stay but for the amount you'll pay here you'll probably want to stay some place more middle on the Strip.",2,1,1

From ""my pillows are too small"", or ""the bed sheets are from 2013 which is SO out of date"" or maybe ""my room is too small"" or finally ""my suite doesn't serve fresh caviar"". Boo hoo. Okay. Now here's what you all are waiting for. I really like it. It's really modern. Even though the room is a bit small (just saying), it's comfy. It's clean. The shower is cool, and so is the bathroom. I loved all the restaurants. Maybe if you're not from LA, the places in the hotel would mean a little more to you because you've probably never heard of ""Fred Segal"" (is that how you spell it?) or ""800 Degrees"". I'm telling you, Las Vegas is like a mini Dubai. You can have breakfast, lunch, and dinner at one hotel. Awesome, right! And service was great too. But our keys broke once, and they got right on it. And then there's tons of mirrors by the elevator. I crashed into one thinking it was an open space. Don't be me. Be cautious, because I was half asleep. I have really nothing bad to say. Am I done yet? Now I am. Great job SLS!",2,0,0
