The restaurant is in a great location, which I think plays a huge role in its allure. It appears to be clean. 

Service is just OK. Food came out quick and we were able to pay and leave very quickly at the end of our meal. Drink refills never really happened, and I have only went on nights that were not particularly busy. 

When it comes to food, I feel the restaurant doesn't live up to the hype. Let me start off by saying that The Mission does offer many unique dishes, such as a duck confeit. I commend them for that. However, when it comes to taste, it's not anything special. There are too many other great local competitors that specialize in Mexican cuisine, especially in the Old Town area.

For example, what is supposed to be a spicy guacamole is actually quite bland. Most proteins are excessively salted. With portion sizes being somewhat on the smaller side, I had high expectations for the taste and texture of food, but there really was nothing to set The Mission above other options. 

Worth a try just to say you have eaten here. Otherwise, I would rather just go to Bandera down the street. They have excellent Southwestern food (the ribs are particularly exceptional). If you're craving Mexican, head over to Barrio Queen which is on the north west side of Old Town.",3,0,0

We had the mahi, sweet potato, and pork shoulder tacos and the were each extremely unique and delectable. I loooooved the green\/verde salsa they served on the side and the two different reds were amazing as well. The waitress suggested the corn and grits as sides and I was somewhat annoyed by her persistence to have us order more more more, but I'm happy we listened! Grits seem to be MIA in most breakfast spots in AZ (east coast I never have a problem finding it) so I was surprised to see it on a dinner menu..and excited to know they were chipotle spiced grits... no words.. so good. 
The corn was mouth watering and I realllllly hope it wasn't just soaked in butter, but they tasted awfully creamy-yum yum yummm!
We got the expresso soaked churros for
dessert and I wasn't in love with them-they weren't overly flavorful and looked kind of sad.

""The Mission"" is next door to The Mission -- that is, the original Spanish Mission from 1905 or so in Scottsdale.  They are not related as far as ownership, but share a similar style.

The restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  Dim chandeliers, and lights hidden behind warm quartz rock and crystals, and gothic decorations, lots of mirrors, crosses, and an angel in the middle of the restaurant.

The servers here are all very friendly and positive.  We had a reservation for the wrong date, but they were able to accommodate us even though we had it wrong. 

The bar is lively, as is the rest of the restaurant.  Lots of couples on dates, men discussing business, and groups of girls doing a ""girls night out"", all dressed up.

Now let's talk about the food. We started with the table side guacamole and crispy pork & cola lime glaze. The crispy pork was amazing. Literally one of the best dishes I've had. It is basically a lettuce wrap with pork and peanut sauce but the pork is what makes this dish so outstanding. The texture is soft but has some bite to it. It's both sweet and salty. Everyone at our table couldn't stop talking about it. It's really hard to put into words but this is a must-have when you come here.

I ordered the shaved kale salad, Almejas Al Vapor (Peruvian clam\/seafood stew), and pork belly aibil. The kale salad was really good. The kale's finely chopped and the blood orange gave it a burst of sweetness. The Almejas Al Vapor was good but nothing memorable. The pork belly aibil was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor.

Unfortunately, the weather wasn't as cooperative second time around but the meal and service didn't fail to live up to prior expectations. 

Things are a bit more crowded and noisy in the restaurant than out (and even though we'd dined inside once before a couple of years ago, we hadn't realized there's an additional patio area to the rear of the establishment) so in order to have conversation with our friends we did have to raise our speaking voices a good deal to be heard over the volume of the large size bar and Friday night crowd but seemed to quickly adjust. Our server appeared quickly, gave us a warm welcome and reviewed our options, including The Mission's signature drinks and table side guacamole.  As an aside - two weeks ago we decided upon medium spiciness but it packed a punch; this time we scaled back to mild and it was perfect for a delicate palate. Server was very attentive to providing more chips as soon as we made our way through the dip. 

My husband knew he wanted to save room for dessert so ordered steak tacos which were limited to about three small but favorable slightly-bigger than bite size tacos; I selected my favorite: jhidori chicken; tender, succulent chicken slices spread over rice  with two flavorful sauces. Desert was their flavorful churros and one serving was actually enough to be shared four ways.

If you are a mainstream diner looking for a quick meal and overpriced wine list, then give it a try, the food is good.  But.....if you have ANY kind of dietary and\/or dining challenges or requirements or want to linger at your table with a drink and\/or conversation (even on slow days), you might want to dine elsewhere.  Many items do not list all their ingredients; you need to ask the server who, depending on the server, will either be accommodating or impatient in helping you select appropriate items and meeting your dining expectations.  We got the impatient one.  Our meal ended up being more of a Gobble 'n Go (overly hasty service as compared to the other tables around us) than a relaxing afternoon experience.  Then, if you pay your bill with cash, be sure not to say ""thank you"" at any time because the server will assume all the cash is for them and not bring you any change, leaving you to either appear a tightwad in asking ""where's my change?"" or end up leaving them more than the 20% you had intended to leave, which was more than their service merited in the first place.

I had the Chilaquiles (corn tortillas, pork, egg, cojita) and have never quite tasted anything like it. A combination of flavors with a little bit of spice. The plate had a very nice portion as well. Good value for $9.

My wife had the corn pancakes with crab and loved the meal.

I made an executive decision to also order the homemade granola, yougurt and tropical fruit. This dish was superb. I was a bit disappointed that the menu listed the fruit options as pineapple, mango and papaya and when the plate arrived there were blueberries instead of the papaya. Mix in the fruit, yogurt and granola and we had a nice complement to our main meal.

The service was good. We had to wait awhile for our food. A table next to us ordered well after me, and ended up getting their food at least 10 minutes before. That was upsetting, because we were both very hungry! At least the waitress came over and said the food was on its way and thanked us for our patience.

The inside is very nice and has a cool decor. 

There is a small patio outside and a full bar inside.

The atmosphere is actually quite romantic and intimate- dim lighting, lots of chandeliers, ect. It's a great for a date, a special occasion or if you're looking for someplace you can dress up for.

On to the food. We ordered:

Guacamole: AMAZING. They mix it table-side so you can choose the ingredients you want included and also the spiciness. It's expensive at $12, but totally worth it

Duck Empanada: This was a meh. Difficult to cut and eat. My friend and I didn't care for this too much. 

Pork Shoulder: The pork shoulder comes as a chuck of meat meant to be shared between two people. The pork is very tender and literally pulls apart. It comes with 10 small corn tortillas (they are delish!), a pineapple glaze, and some topping to make your own tacos with. I actually added the salsa that came with the chips to my tacos instead of the glaze because the glaze was too sweet for me.

Pumpkin Bread Pudding: HIGHLIGHT OF THE MEAL! Order it. Just do it. It comes out warm sitting in a deliciously salty carmel with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and pumpkin seeds for texture. Possibly the best dessert I've ever had. And I've had a lot of desserts.

Margarita: Can't remember the name of the one I got, but it's the one with 1\/2 the calories. They use three limes to make it, so it still doesn't taste too strong and I liked that it wasn't as sugary and heavy as most other margaritas.

When we were asked twice how things were, we answered the second time with, Many folks are using phones and flashlights to see, maybe you need some lights over here! I presume it was the Manager who didn't even listen to what we said and went to speak with the waitress. He seemed pretty Arrogant. He should lose the attitude because dinner this evening was very disappointing.  Presentation is very important for customers.

My good friend held my baby shower at The Mission and it was just amazing. High class all the way. First off I just loved the decor, it was elegant and fun at the same time. The illuminated salt bricks were very cool and I just liked the trendy feel of the place.

Brian, the owner, went above and beyond to make sure that we got the ""back room"" for my shower so we could have privacy. They even printed up our own menu's specifically for us. We had our own wait staff who was very prompt and helpful. We felt very important the whole time we were there.

Even though I couldn't partake in the mimosa bar we had set up, my friends all said it was wonderful, as well as the mojitos...I'll have to go back to partake :)

For my breakfast, I ordered Chilaquiles, which was fried corn tortillas topped with red chile pork, fried egg and cotija cheese. They were delicious. I think there could have been a little more pork on them, but for the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed them. It was like breakfast nachos, and who doesn't like nachos. The other dish that looked unbelievable was the Cinnamon Pecan Waffles topped with cinnamon helado. Oh my goodness...if I could have eaten two dishes, I would have definitely ordered those as well! They just looked tempting. For dessert we had the Espresso churros. The churros were okay...a little too crispy, they would have been better if they were served warmer and  if they were softer. But the milkshake that came with it was great! Very creamy and just plain yummy.

I plan on going back when not pregnant so I can also try out the tequila bar! There are so many things on the menu I can't wait to try. Definitely had a great overall experience at the Mission!",2,2,4

Setting:
The weather was perfect so we dined on the patio at a corner table with an umbrella.
The corner table had bench seating on one side and chairs on the other and it was actually quite comfy.
There's a raised planter in between you and the side walk to give a bit of separation from you and the street.  It's a fairly quiet street (even with Spring Training fans walking around) so it wasn't loud.
Great place to hang out and relax.

Starters:
Bloody Mary and Mimosas
I had the BM... it was very good.  I wanted to order another one but figured I'd better ""be good"" and only have one.
Mom sucked down her Mimosa.... She wanted another one too but she refrained.  :)

Fresh, Table-side Guacamole...  So!  Good!
They make it to your preference... so if you don't like onions or cilantro or whatever then you can omit what you don't like.  But let me tell you... all the ingredients were Excellent.  We opted for Medium heat and it was perfect... the heat from the pepper balanced the creaminess of the avocados.... Oh and the roasted pepitas on top were like the ""can't live without sprinkles on a cupcake"".  Next time I make guac... I'm adding a a bit of pepitas.  These add a nice flavor, crunch and texture to the dip.

I ordered the Chicken Torta with an egg on top (it was brunch so I figured an egg would make it breakfast-y)... Mom ordered the Green Chilaquiles and the husband ordered the Chorizo Scramble.

The husband's Chorizo Scramble was good and the Chorizo had lots of flavor and a bit of a kick.  But overall, I was unimpressed with the dish.  It was your basic egg dish.

My Chicken Torta was really cheesy... I don't mean it was silly... I mean... there was lots of cheese on it.  This isn't a bad thing if you love cheese. I didn't realize this so next time (because there will be a next time)... I'll order something a little lighter.  This dish was meaty and filling.  I didn't recognize most of the ingredients but it sure was tasty... plus it had nice heat which made the cheese a little less overpowering.  It's a pretty big dish... I didn't finish it... so the husband helped me out.

Mom's Green Chilaquiles was Awesome!  BIG too!  I called them Gourmet Nachos.  Just thinking about them makes my mouth water.  If you're adventurous and have never tried these before.... Order these with a beer.  Total comfort food.  :)

Let's start with the pros: Nice ambience, great decor, friendly (and good looking) staff. The Chipotle Grits we had we're pretty tasty.

Now for the cons: way over priced in all regards. It seems they're big fans of the $14 price point. That's what it costs for all their signature margaritas which are small in size and low on alcohol (I drank two and didn't even feel a buzz - although they were tasty). The table-made guacamole is also $14, and it was average at best and small in quantity. My girlfriend and I both agreed we've had much better for much less $$$ at practically every other restaurant which serves guac (including at home). The Mahi Mahi tacos we ordered we're also $14, and tiny as could be. Like three little corn tortilla saucers on the plate with hardly anything on top. The fish was fried and the whole dish was ... average.

Upon walking in I immediately felt a sense of awe for the atmosphere was great. I loved the old chandeliers and religious themed decor. They had a nice mix of contemporary and Victorian style decor. There was only one thing that bothered me about the atmosphere - the music. I thought it wasn't appropriate for the theme of the restaurant. It was house electronic music. There could have been a deeper meaning for it but I wasn't getting it.

First we got the guac - which as hand mixed right in front of you! We agreed it was the best guac we have ever had. 

I got the mahi mahi tacos and my girlfriend got the vegetarian tacos. My tacos were so so. I felt that the batter was too thick and tasteless. Mahi Mahi is generally a tasteless fish (in my opinion) so I felt it needed something to give it a kick. The tarter style sauce just wasn't cutting it. I don't think I'd recommend the Mahi Mahi.

However, the vegetable tacos were incredible. They were so sweet and flavorful. Highly recommend them. They are definitely unforgettable !

Upon recommendation of several Scottsdale residents, and the concierge at my hotel, I went to The Mission last night expecting to be blown away. What I got however, was nothing close. 

I arrived to the restaurant shortly after 7:30 and approached the host stand for a table. The hostess was super friendly, and greeted me right away, informing me the wait for inside was currently about half an hour, but there was no wait if I wanted to sit outside. Getting hungry, and not wanting to wait, I elected to go with the outside seating, and was soon after walked out to a nice patio area out back. Within minutes of being sat, my server for the evening, Arturo, stopped by to introduce himself, and see if I had any questions about the menu.

A few minutes later, Arturo returned to take my order, and I ended up going with the Pork Belly Appetizer and Short Rib Barbacoa Tacos.  

The Pork Belly Appetizer was quite delicious, although slightly overcooked. Parts of the belly were burnt, making it very tough to eat. The sauces served on the side were all very good though, and really complimented the dish. What drove me crazy about this part of the meal however was the corn tortillas. When I ordered the dish, the server asked if I would like corn tortillas, to which I happily obliged. When the dish came out, they also brought out 4 very small corn tortillas to go along with it.  At no point did the server mention these would be an additional charge. Then the check came, and I discovered not only was I charged for them, but the cost was astronomical. For these 4 mini tortillas, I was billed $10. A staggering $2.50 per tortilla which could not have been larger than a small sand dollar.

The short rib tacos were okay. While the short rib in side was so tender it practically melted in your mouth, the toppings ( b&b pickles and cabbage) really distracted from the flavors of the dish. Moving forward I would suggest the pickles be removed or served on the side as they did nothing to add to the dish, and this is coming from a guy who absolutely loves pickles.

Other than the pricing issue with the tortillas, I had no issues with service, and was actually fairly impressed. Arturo and his serving assistant were always nearby if I needed anything, and my glass never went empty.

Based on this experience, I would not likely return to The Mission again in the future, but would not recommend against it, just that you consider other options.",4,1,2

The atmosphere is amazing, the staff welcoming, the food unique and tasty... oh, and the drinks go down easy too!

The Mission has become Jared's second home - he's there much more than I am!  I go for an occasional drink or dinner.  My favorite menu item is the tableside prepared guacamole.  It's fantastic!  I am also a huge fan of the white bean puree, the street corn, and the salmon.  I wish they had some lighter options on the menu though - just a suggestion on behalf of those of us that are health-conscious!

If you enjoy Latin-inspired fare, for sure go check out The Mission... Or at the very least, go in for a drink and some guacamole.  Look for Jared at the bar when you're there!

The corn tortillas were fresh and the pork was fork tender.

I had the Grouper which was great, but my husband had ""the chef's favorite dish to make"" the pork shoulder with chorizo and it was below average.  Dry and lacked flavor.

I had to ask for another glass of water because my glass had a huge crack down one side.

We had lunch there yesterday since I wanted to try someplace new and I'd read good reviews. It's ""new Latin"" cuisine, brought to you by the people behind the successful Zinc Bistro, Matt Carter and Terri Ellisor.

     The setting is lovely. It's housed in one of the outbuildings of the blindingly white old Mission Church in Old Town Scottsdale. You walk through an attractive fireplace'd patio and into the aroma of fire- grilled meats and romantic darkness (even at lunch). Unfortunately, you're assaulted by the background music which was very loud and distracting.  There's an interesting back-lit wall of orange and beige Himalayan salt blocks (actually I thought they were fake bricks until I read differently - gauche me). Lots of fancy chandeliers hang from the black ceiling, casting only a little light on the faux finished ochre walls and the somewhat crowded dark topped tables. Our server, Derek, added to the ambience - he was attractove, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Many of our south-of-the-border neighbors are represented on it: Mexico of course, Ecuador, Peru, Columbia, Venezuela, Uruguay, Cuba,and probably some I've missed. 

     I ordered a Cubano torta, one of my favorite grilled sandwiches with pork belly, smoked ham, swiss cheese, pickle, dijon and yucca ($12). The pork belly was meltingly tender.  Surprisingly, the torta did not come with a side, which struck me as pretty chintzy for the $12 price, but that was okay because I had to try the Creamy Grits ($8). Ken chose the Pabellon Arepas ($12). An arepa is a cross between a pancake and an english muffin. It's made out of a special pre-cooked corn meal, water and a little salt. First it's fried on a griddle, then it can be baked in the oven for a while where it rises a little and becomes less dense. It's then split, sometimes some of the interior is scooped out, and then it's filled with whatever delicacy strikes your fancy. In this case the arepa contained braised beef, peppers, black beans, cotija cheese, and fried plantains. So good. I spent an hour today googling arepas recipes and plan to go in search of the special corn meal tomorrow. The only disappointing (actually downright bad) thing on Ken's plate were the french fries, a mixture of white and sweet potatoes. They were supposed to have been sprinkled with lime and cumin, but they weren't, and also they were sadly limp. But OMG, the grits!!!! These were made with the addition of chipotle powder, butter, honey, and cotija cheese. They were on the spicy side, but the heat was moderated by the honey. The color was kind of a cross between pink and salmon (at least that's how it looked in the dim light), which made it even more interesting to eat. $8 for a good sized bowl which I proceeded to eat pretty much by myself as the grits were too spicy for everybody else (this was fortunate, because I really don't know if I would have been able to bring myself to share).

     Our friend Ernest had a Skewered Grill Prawn Salad ($14), with arugula, yuzu vinaigrette, avocado, potato and orange sections. He said the prawns were nicely cooked but were somewhat too spicy for his taste. Anna ordered a chicken arepa ($12) with chorizo, corn, aji amarillo (the menu doesn't tell you, but this is a hot yellow chili pepper from South America - be warned), and Oaxaca cheese. While she didn't complain, I have the feeling she would have been happier without the pepper. The food here really isn't for the faint of heart (or heat). I don't know if the kitchen would be able or willing to tone it down for you, but it's worth asking.
   
     But the desserts won everybody over. We tried the Pumpkin Bread Pudding ($6), which is composed of pumpkin bread, creme brulee, a butterscotch sauce loaded with Scotch, pepitas, and topped with Berto's cinnamon gelato. To die for, not to mention get drunk on. The Fried Bananas ($7) were terrific, too, served with butter, nutmeg, peanuts, and a dollop of peanut butter mousse.

     Go on line to see the dinner menu. It's expensive, most of the entrees are in the $20+ range, but they sound fabulous. The Mission is, for me, one of the most exciting restaurants I've been to in a long time, and I'm grateful for it. But especially for the grits!",3,1,1

It's such a nice departure from the Mexican food you find on every corner. This ""Latin American"" food is flavorful and fun, there is really no comparison to anything else around. If you're a fan of pork, you'll be in heaven. Sure, the tacos are tiny but they are filled to the top with the good stuff-meat and seafood. Who cares about the tortilla? 
Tableside guacamole is fantastic. Pork belly can't be beat. The pork tacos, seafood tacos (especially the scallops), and the beef short ribs are some of the best things I have ever tasted. The drinks are expensive but they are yummy.
I like the presentation of the tortillas on the salt blocks and the salt wall around the kitchen is pretty cool. The decor is very nicely done with two huge patios that are perfect for Arizona evening dining or enjoying a cocktail in the sun.
They get knocked one star because service is not consistent. I have been here four times now, twice the service was over-the-top, best waiter\/waitress I've ever had.

Upside - My wife's scallops came out way-too-salty. She asked the server to have them redone, and they came back oversalted a 2nd time. This time the manager came over, apologized profusely, and offered to comp her a different entree. By this time she had been nibbling on appetizers and just wasn't interested in another entree, so they brought us a variety of desserts (comped) for the table to share. 

That's how you treat guests and solve a problem. Extremely well-handled by the server and manager, which is enough to have us give The Mission another try this weekend.",1,0,0

We where looking forward to enjoying some tapas and tacos for an authentic southwest meal. We should of just said 4 orders of grey leather and fat please! because that's what their ""famous porchetta"" looked like it was obviously sitting and left over from the weekend.
The waiter introduced himself and said ""before anything get it out of your head that this is a Mexican restaurant because is not! don't even look at the tacos and order from the main course page""
We were a bit surprised as the taco selection looked excellent and that it was we went for. So after the waiter basically saying the tacos suck we order some apps fresh guac at the table, Mexican corn both excellent but the pork belly wrap wasn't crispy as advertised it was like jerky and the duck empenadas were sold out. Then the grand finale we order from the ""main course page"" so we decided on the duck and halibut after about 15 minutes and being up sold to doubles on our drinks by the waiter who obviously wanted to jack up the bill not to receive a ""taco tip"" we are told they are they are out of the coveted main course items he pushed on us leaving the option of the porchetta that was . Have a feeling the dishwasher was cooking and not the weekend chef and we still tipped 20% because that's how we roll but thanks to this horrible experience we would never come back or recommend this restaurant. The decor is great and I'm sure with the right waiter and chef working it may be good.

We arrived a few minutes early for our six pm reservation and even though they had a number of tables open, walk-ins were being told 1 hour plus for a wait (BE SURE TO make reservations).  It's a pretty big place, long and narrow with a small patio outside in the front and another in the back.  

Service here was very strong with water arriving at the table shortly after we were seated and our personable waiter, Greg, doing a nice job describing the menu and making recommendations. Glasses were constantly filled throughout the evening and Greg was there just when we needed additional drinks.

Drinks here are made with fresh squeezed juices and are lively and fresh.  I enjoyed the blood orange margarita and my wife the mission Margarita.

We got the special guacamole-prepared table-side (fresh and tasty) which can be customized to your particular tastes by you server. It came with a big bowl of thin and crispy chips and some smoky salsa.

For dinner, we decided on the slow roasted pork shoulder tacos for two ($34). You get a baseball-sized hunk of pork that's been simmering in a sweet pineapple habanero sauce along with 10 small tortillas and some chopped onion, cilantro and cheese.  This was more than we could finish and SO GOOD.

The only hiccup was that our dinner arrived while our server was just getting started with the guacamole but he wisely sent it back to the kitchen so we wouldn't feel rushed.

All in all a nice setting, good food and wonderful service.

I was here on business, and after many positive reviews (both from locals, Yelp and other friends), we decided to head to the Mission Old Town.

Boy - were we wrong. Our reservation wasn't available on time, and more time was spent waiting than eating or drinking!

We waited at a table for our reservation and for someone to take a drink order (we were told not to go to the bar). After being seated, we waited for a server.

Moreover, it really sucks to be presented with a dish that has multiple elements, and then not be able to see what's what without a flashlight....hmm, is that julienned item a piece of apple, a piece of zucchini, or something else entirely?

No joke -- throughout the meal, I had to put down my knife and fork, and scan my plate with the tiny flashlight the manager handed out, so I could see where to cut the meat off the duck leg I was eating. I'm not making this up...when we asked to up the lights a bit, the manager came by and told us he couldn't do that, but he could give us each a tiny flashlight!

Since the place is right next to the SCPA, it's convenient for a pre-performance meal, so we may be back when it's a little cooler and we can sit outdoors where there's some light. But it's not 5-star dining, so we won't go out of our way to return.",0,0,0

You're not coming here for traditional Mexican food.  If you're looking for ""authenticity"" or ""regional cuisine,"" this isn't the place.  But if you're looking for good contemporary interpretations of Mexican food in a great setting, this is a good place to be.

We've only ever been here for brunch, but it is y far one of our favorite brunch places.  It usually starts with a Mission Mary - their interpretation of a bloody mary.  It is spicy, but more than spicy, it is also peppery, which adds a great new dimension to the drink.

Our go-to dish - the chilaquiles.  Red or green, doesn't matter, they are pretty tasty here.  Slight sourness in the green chiles, some decent heat in the red, the totopos aren't completely soaked through so there is some texture in the chips.  There is plenty of sauce to cover over the chips and get the flavor you're looking for, and juuuuuust enough meat to make the meal more substantial.  

The house guacamole made tableside is also very, very good.  One of the best in the Valley.  It's got more stuff in it than your typical guacamole, but from the cotija cheese to the pepitas, they all add a little something.

Tried my wife's cinnamon pecan waffles.  Awesome.  Really good.  Not super sweet but really well balanced.  I've also tried the corn and crab pancake - these are perhaps the weakest brunch dish that we have tried.  Also had the regular steak tacos off the lunch menu and they too are tasty.  Not the best tacos ever, but still tasty.

This last trip, I tried their pig out all-you-can-eat pork bar where you have a choice between carnitas and pork confit tacos in a taco bar setting.  It's worth the money and it's pretty tasty, but not perfect.  The carnitas were a little dry.  The confit pork was definitely preferable and was better seasoned.  The salsa selection was also a little weak.  They have a little of everything (a tomatillo, a pico de gallo, etc.) but none of them tasted all that great.  I kept my condiments basic - onions and cilantro.  Street taco style.  The other slight weakness, the tortillas.  Small street-style corn tortillas, these were a little too thick to double up but too thin to hold up on its own.  The flavor of the masa was ok.  Would I order the all-you-can-eat again?  I think I would, but I'd really have to be in the mood and be pretty hungry.

So again.  Not traditional Mexican if you are a purist.  But still come for the good food.  It's worth the price.",0,2,0

They put things toghether on a plate that do not make sense to the palate.

I do love the flavor of the food, but the portions-- particularly on the tacos-- are pretty small for the price.  However, they make the guacamole for you right there at the table, and it's $9, but it's totally worth it.  I am a guacamole fiend, and I would say it's the best I've had so far in Scottsdale.

That being said, I have to say the bad:  1.  Parking not great.  2.  When we showed up, they gave our table to another couple right in front of us, even though we had reservations.  3.  They had run out of menus, so we had to wait for them... for over 20 minutes.  4.  I was most looking forward to trying the Texas grits, and when they didn't show up, I asked our server about them, and he told me he was sorry, but they were out of them.  That's fine, but I wish he had told me sooner.

However, again, the personality of the server was nice and accomodating, and the flavor of the food at The Mission is delicious.",2,1,1

They were probably not needed at 11am, but it did get a little busier as morning turned to afternoon. We asked to be seated on the patio and the hostess seemed somewhat confused. When she took us outside she tried to seat us right next to the only other table on the patio. We said we would prefer to sit on the other, empty side. The next couple that came in was seated right next to us!

The menu looked good, but the brunch section only had about 5 items, not much of a choice. The server was friendly and recommended the huevos rancheros, she asked if we wanted meat, my girlfriend said no as she is a vegetarian. When it came it had pork, but the food runner was quick to correct it.

I asked for her recommendation between the red or green chilaquilles and she wholeheartedly said green. Seeing that the green had cilantro and the red didn't , I went green - they were good, but the green was chicken and the red was pork and everyone raves about the pork here, maybe I should have got the red.

The talk of the town here is ""try the guacamole"" and while it wasn't bad, making it tableside wasn't much of a show and one avocado certainly wasn't worth $12. The awkwardness started when the guacamole was finished and plopped on the table, but the chips didn't arrive until a good 5 minutes later. Wasn't sure if I should be eating it with a spoon or not.

Mimosas and bloody marys were half off, which was nice, but when I ordered a second one it didn't arrive until well after I was finished eating and then only after a reminder.

Maybe it was because we came so soon after they opened and maybe everyone was still hungover from Saturday night, but the hostess, server and cook just weren't on their A game today.",5,2,0

My favorite dish, hands down, was a side of creamy grits with chipotle and honey. Everything was tasty, duck empanadas, pork belly pibl, guacamole, though nothing especially stood out as much as that humble side of grits mixed with perfection.

The service was a little over-attentive, but the guy was sweet and obviously trying his best. And he was Johnny-on-the-spot with the wine, so who can really complain about a few interruptions?

Cute spot for brunch. A dark contrast to the blazing sun outside. Great cocktails (and the waiter is extremely knowledgeable and can recommend some delicious drinks).

Must order: tableside guacamole. Just do it.

If you like steak, order the Tecate Marinated Skirt Steak. Make sure you add an egg. They may throw in an extra egg, just for kicks. Accept this gift.

has me writing of the place for good. I will say the service was always speedy and quick both times but when we went to brunch the menu has better options like the chiliquiles.

 My problem is the limited menu during lunch time and the quality of that food. The table side guac was ok and some could say great if they prefer it one way more than another. I would say it wasn't close to Salty's but not terrible like America's taco shop on 7th st. There menu consist of two basic options excluding the soup during lunch, tacos and tortas. Their tortas remind me more of something you would find at a wildflower except without any good mixture of ingredients. you would think that if you only served 5 different things you would be really good. I don't mind a small amount of choices, even if you think of your own home rotation of meals you cook for your family you could limit it to your top 5 things and have a menu that would kick the crap out of most restaurant menus I am sure. I had the brisket torta which seemed to be a mix of a lox and a thin(super thin) layer of burnt beef. My girlfriend thought the same. My friend had another one that looked better but she said she wouldn't rush to come back for it. The side of beans were ok and the chorizo and potatoes were ok more for the potato side as the chorizo was semi bland and couldn't hold a candle to any Shreiner's offering.

So we had a 90$ lunch (no alcohol) that had faux latin food. When I went to brunch my girl did like the drinks and the chiliquiles are good but you could do better from any torta chain with little effort and just suffer from the ambiance for better food. Guero's tortas comes to mind but like I said even Subway could own these guys.",1,0,0

The Mission is located in Old Town Scottsdale, and is situated between the old Spanish style church and the black smith shop for you old school Scottsdale folk. If you're looking for a great place to take out of towners for some refined Latin style cooking, and a taste of Old Town Scottsdale this restaurant really can't be beat.

It's one of the few places that still do fresh Guacamole tableside that you can have mild, spicy or hot. I recommend the hot, as it's how I prepare my Guac at home. Mike the bartender is quickly gaining a following as a specialist in ""spicy"" margaritas, but make no mistake Mike is a true mixologist and takes his craft very seriously. Mike will usually have two frozen margaritas on tap at any given time and one version will usually be spicy. I've had the habanero, pear & ginger (yes that's right), watermelon and the spicy mango. All are awesome. Ask for a sample. Mike also has other cocktails and non frozen margs always on hand.

The chips and salsa are done in house the salsa is great and has a wonderful smokiness to it. If you want some additional dimension to your chips and salsa ask for the additional salsas that usually have on hand for the asking. It's worth asking for it as they are wonderfully prepared and add another flavor depth to your culinary experience.  However you will need ask specially for the ghost chilies salsa, and its hot, hot stuff comprade so please be careful. In India they use ghost chilies to keep elephants away if you catch my drift.

 I really love the Sunday afternoon pork taco all you can eat special. They roast a couple of pigs on property and serve until the pig is gone. The pork shoulder and the carnitas will rock your world with fresh made little corn tortillas. Its ""Delicioso"" as Jimmy Dean would say. You can also order the pork as entrees if you're not there Sunday or just want an entrée; however the pork shoulder can't be beat as it explodes off the bone. 

I had the Almegas Al Vapor which is Peruvian seafood soup. This blew me away and wonderfully balanced with a light creamy broth and very unique flavors. The soup is not over powered by the seafood and the whole bowl is nicely done and makes for a great tasting dish just to expand your culinary diversity. The other side order I have to recommend is the street corn. The corn is sweet, wonderfully spiced and makes for a wonderful addition to any meal.  While I haven't had them I hear the sweet potato fries are pretty stellar as well.

Two desserts that can't be missed are the pumpkin bread pudding and the espresso churros. The pumpkin bread pudding is made from scratch down to the caramel sauce. It's great even if you don't like bread pudding, try it. The other desert I really liked is the espresso churros with little chocolate milkshakes. It's a great dish for out of towners that may be a little reserved with food that they are not normally accustomed to.

The Mission is a small restaurant, so make sure to book reservations during the high season and most of all enjoy la dolce far niente.",1,0,1

We had the MAHI MAHI TACOS and the SHORT RIB TACOS. Both were savory, but much smaller than we expected (think medallion size), and the short ribs could have been more tender. They were a bit dry, but still tasty. 

CONS: TABLE-SIDE GUACAMOLE. If you have a low tolerance for spicy flavors, definitely get mild or not spicy at all. We ordered the medium, and it was wayyyy to spicy, practically inedible for us. The PORTION sizes were far too small and the food was expensive for what was on the plate. Also, the MIMOSA was ok, but was a bit strong. I was expecting more orange juice with a splash of champagne and maybe a strawberry, but this was champagne with a splash of orange juice.",0,0,0

I've been here once before as part of a large group and we sat on the patio. I distinctly remember excellent service and a great atmosphere.  This time my small group sat inside and also had a good experience. 

I'm 28 with ""perfect"" vision (thanks to Lasik), and I almost turned my phone flashlight on to read the menu. I mean really. It's insane dark in there, but I suppose it makes it intimate and romantic (just what I needed with my coworkers. :))

The service was pretty good. A little inconsistent and the last round of drinks took upwards of 15 minutes, but she was knowledgable on the menu and friendly. The man refilling my water glass was on it though, which I definitely appreciated! I had the blood orange margarita and it was excellent. I couldn't taste (or feel) the tequila, but the flavor was delicious. 

Anyway, on to the food. The chips are served warm and they are the perfect thickness (which is thin, in case you are wondering). The salsa is great, a little smoky, a little spicy and overall just great.  We ordered the tableside guacamole and had the person make it spicy. It was definitely spicy and also delicious. Probably the best guacamole I've ever had but I can't pinpoint why.

I ordered the Jidori chicken and it was just OK. Nothing extremely special, just marinated chicken served on the bone. The cheesy rice it comes with is outstanding though. However, the dish is most certainly not worth $30.

We started with the tableside guac and it was delish! We ate every last bite and definitely enjoyed the presentation aspect. Then we shared the corn (to die for) on the cob with a clever mix of spicy mayo and cotija cheese for the right mix of salty, heat and cream. 

We finished up by sharing the pork shoulder tacos. These were fantastic and love that all their tortillas (including the chips) are 100% corn and therefore GF! I could have eaten 10 of them as they were that good!

Let's start with the fact that they seated us promptly at our reservation time, and that reservation had only been made that day.....surprising, because the place was packed!! Alfonso was our waiter, and he was awesome and didn't hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner. First, the margaritas. ....this place knows how to pour, and they are fresh  - the only way we will drink them. Next - there are only 3 places in Phoenix that can make good table-side guacamole, and this is the best of them. Alfonso suggested a fried pork belly\/cola reduction appetizer that I had to be talked into. OMG....heaven, and such a complex blend of flavors that the sweet, crunchiness of the pork belly can only be described as ""worth it"" if you are balking at the issue of pork belly.
Entree: we chose the Chorizo Porchetta and the Scallops. Both were excellent and may I say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt. We never waited and yet didn't feel rushed.
Dessert: I confess that I read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions, and while other reviews loved the selections ...I wasn't blown away. The churros were small and dough-y, and the milkshake was just to heavy\/sweet after a meal.....better to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream. Fried bananas didn't excite me either. Bananas are bananas..... The pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and Autumn-like for a 110 degree day in Arizona and did not compliment the Latin flavors of the dinner. I feel their dessert menu needs to be expanded in a way that compliments their cuisine....some citrus sorbet, chocolate-with-red-chile cake, lime cheesecake. At any rate, I still give them the full Monty on stars!!!
Most recent visit: the food was just as great, but we weren't as blown away by the ambiance. We were seated at a table for two on the back wall. My elbow literally kept bumping the gentleman to my left and the conversation to the right of us (a party of four) was literally so close that it inhibited us from having much conversation of our own.

We had been to Scottsdale before and tried more than a few good Mexican joints, but as The Mission had the highest ratings on yelp, we knew it was a must-try while we were in town. 

Overall, the ambiance was steller. The restaurant was designed and decorated to look like a mission and had great patio dining with awesome lighting and candles everywhere. it is in a nice part of town with great shopping as well so great area to walk around in before or after dinner.

After sitting down, we started our meal with margaritas and house-made guacamole. My coworker had the guacamole margarita and said it was outstanding. I ordered the primarita which the waiter said was the house specialty and rated the best margarita in scottsdale. While it was definitely good I didn't find it all that different from other margaritas I have had in town and really didn't find it worth the $12 price tag. Our waiter made the guacamole right at the table and my coworker (as you can tell, a guac enthusiast) said it was awesome as well, but I (again) didn't find it all that unique.

My coworker ordered the halibut and I ordered the Duck Confit as our main appetizers. We were a bit confused as the restaurant markets itself online as a latin american restaurant, however when we arrived our waiter described the food as more of a latin american\/french fusion. While the halibut and duck were very good, we found the plates to be overly complicated and the flavor profiles to be very confusing. Even though all the dishes sounded very tasty, the execution didn't really come through and the overall experience of the dish was very muddled.

For an appetizer we ordered the tableside guacamole.  Very cool to see it actually made in front of you.  Great quality and quantity.  Perfect for two people.

Next up...our main dishes.  We ordered the kobe dog and the skirt steak tacos.  I can't begin to describe the amount of flavor that was contained in these two meals.  Unbelievably good.  Not really knowing what to expect from the kobe dog, I was pleasantly surprised when it came to the table.  Nothing better than a hot dog wrapped in bacon and covered in green chile, beans, red peppers, onions, and a delicious sauce.

The atmosphere was nice but much to dark to see anything especially with the sunsetting through the windows. Service was very good and was sooo... quick I felt the idea was to just get the table turned. Food was quite good but overpriced for the portion size and that comes from someone that lives in South Florida. We had talked to many locals about the place before we went and while no one said anything bad they always had recommended other places when we asked where to go. Unfortunately we didn't heed the suggestions. So 3 Margaritas, Guacamole, 2 entrees flat iron and filet, and a dessert pumpkin bread pudding were $156 so I'll leave it to you to make your judgement.

But hey, it's nice to go out to fancy shmancy places sometimes...

We were seated right away since we had reservations.  The mission was packed on a Saturday night, ambiance is dark and I guess you could say sexy (as I heard the table next to us saying).  Our waitress was attentive and made recommendations as we requested.  

Guacamole- this is made fresh and right next to your table.  I thought this was good and full of flavor, different than other guacs I'm used to bc this one had a bunch of stuff mixed into it.  My hubby though thought this was ok since he prefers simple guac of just the avocado, cilantro, lime and onions.  So just depends on your preference.

Almejas al vapor- some sort of clam and shrimp stew.  We ordered this bc it was recommended.  I love salty food and this was waaaay too salty, not even good salty.  Our waitress was nice about it and took it back, later she said the chef agreed it was too salty and apologized.  What was even classy of them is they took it off our tab and gave us a free dessert.  I don't remember the name of the dessert but it was yummy, the best thing we ate here besides the corn.

Grilled street corn- ok I don't know why we ordered this when you can get this for a buck at a swapmeet.  But it was deelish, nice and buttery.

Grilled chicken tacos- we were warned these were tiny and yup they're tiny, smaller than street tacos! 

We wanted to order the short rib entree but they were sold out that night :-(

Some of our favorite dishes were - guacamole made at the table (medium spice), short rib tacos, mahi mahi tacos, pork belly appetizer, and bread pudding.

I had the avocado margarita and was pleasantly surprised that it was a really good margarita.  One of our friends ordered one of the tequila flights, and he said it was the best value he'd ever seen - 4 very nice samplings of tequila and great quality for a great price.

The decor was nice, and we were especially taken by the wall of Himalayan salt bricks.  It really is a sight to see with the lighting behind the bricks shining through. The one negative was that we were at a table with a HUGE painting sticking out from the wall that was a little intrusive, but it didn't ruin our meal by any means.

From start to finish I was impressed. Our group enjoyed a 3-course meal which included a sweet, savory and crunchy pork belly lettuce wrap. It was heavenly. Second came the kale salad. I wasn't too much of a fan, but it seemed to pretty popular with my dining companions. It's probably a matter of preference as it was accompanied with a unique tangy dressing. Lastly, we had various tacos. Sounds simple, but they were a far cry from your typical tacos. Seasoned, juicy and garnished with toppings the chicken, beef and pork were anything but ordinary. On top of great food, the ambiance is reason enough to drop by. Apparently Autumn in Arizona means pretty much perfect weather.

We arrived on time, we seated promptly at a nice table and brought water immediately. However. It went down hill from there fast. Two different servers came up and introduced themselves as our servers. It felt rushed. We gave one our drink order, only to have the other come up and ask what we would like to drink. What...? The wine came a long while later. We put in an order for a jidori chicken appetizer with a server and some guac made table side. Both were good. For dinner we ordered the diver scallops and another chicken item. Right after one server took our order for entrees, another came up and dropped off dessert menus. What...? Did we not get our entree order in? We will never be sure when the entree orders were put in. Did the server forget? Why did we get dessert menus? It took almost an hour for entrees to come out. Which was fine as the appetizers filled us up. But still. Both entrees were good but I've had comparable food with proper service at other places. My scallops were perfect although I realized I wasn't a big fan of the set it was with. Boyfriend liked his chicken. We were planning to get dessert but after all was said and done I was full and completely turned off by the service. Our bill was somewhere around $130 before tip. I've worked fine dining, I'm still a server. This was the worst service I've ever had, not because the people weren't nice but because it was so chaotic and stressful and the energy was reflected onto the guests. Def not worth $160, which is a lot to us. Lastly, I forgot my sweater there and didn't realize until we got home. I called the restaurant and the host said they had it. I gave them my name and number and said I would be in the following day. I went to pick it up the next morning and it was no where to be found. Kind of ridiculous if you ask me. Save your money.

Yesterday was my 30th birthday, a day I feared and looked forward to for a very long time and after having an amazing weekend in Scottsdale eating at amazing restaurants such as Cafe Monarch, Citizen Public house and Steak 44 I had decided to leave the Mission to celebrate my actual bday dinner. I had made reservations maybe 2 months ago for a dinner with my family including two toddlers for a 5:30 NON rush hour spot specifically asking for a nice table because I would be celebrating such a big bday. The day came and they had confirmed my reservation and I had nicely asked for a table outside since it's a little nicer to be with my family as their inside is so dark and the music is blasting and the guy on the phone told me no problem we will get you a nice table outside. 

We arrived on time, yep right on the dot and the restaurant was almost empty on the inside and half empty outside so I thought there would be no problem in accommodating my one request to sit outside. Their hostess was cold, no smile, attitude as large as camelback mountain, she just said sorry NO, just sit inside. She basically wanted to put us in a dark area of the restaurant where there was no people. I asked for a manager because I could not believe this kind of service I was getting at this point and I regret because what followed was just disgusting and inhumane. 

This manager on duty on November 6th is a ruthless, pathetic lack of a person. He didn't care that it was my bday, he probably has something against toddlers (even though mine behave very well) and also, not sure where he is from, but we all had the feeling he has something against women since he spoke to me in a demeaning and very condescending way. I think the owners of this establishment should be ashamed in hiring someone who knows nothing about customer service and customer appreciation. I explained my situation and he said first ""sorry, nothing I can do you can go to another restaurant of ours and sit outside there."" I explained to him that I have children and it's hard to carry them around town from one restaurant to the next. He just didn't care. I also told him that out of all the restaurants in Scottsdale I chose this one to celebrate my day, again he didn't care. I even promised if he sat us outside (which again was half empty) we would be out by 7pm to accommodate ""all this future reservations."" Nope, he said can't do anything but to sit you inside. I found a round table inside and couldn't believe how rude he has been these past 20 minutes which we could have already started eating outside but I honestly didn't have the energy to argue anymore. So as we almost sat down he said in a sarcastic tone ""I'm glad I was able to help you."" 

I thought to myself wow, you have got to be kidding me, he has done nothing but mistreat my parents in their 60s by having them stand with two toddlers while I tried to get us a table I made more than 2 months ago. I said no, you did not really help us. He said ""if you don't like it, you can get the hell out of here"" wow, I was shocked. I was just about to be defeated and sit inside of this empty restaurant on the inside. A man who was so egotistical who knew it was almost 6pm now on a Sunday evening during high season just basically kicked us out of a restaurant and then told me ""I know nothing about how the restaurant industry works."" He knew I would have a hard time getting a reservation anywhere special last minute but he still kicked us out. This is not Latin America or Europe, this is the damn UNITED STATES where we strive to make customers feel appreciated. 

Well let me tell you something to that evil man who has no compassion for anyone but himself. 

A. We were lucky enough to get in somewhere very good (LAST MINUTE) a place that respects people of all ages.

B. One thing I truly know about the restaurant business is that number one is customer service which you have NONE OF. People come back based on experiences not just by your food.

C. You will also never succeed anywhere beyond a manager position when act like a chauvinistic piece of ***t. Pardon my language Yelp. But being from Chicago and knowing many successful restaurant owners, there is no way anyone would promote or work with someone who treats people the way you do. 

I would obviously never come back here just from my experiences of talking to two people here. It was something I wish I never experienced in my 30 years and hopefully never will again. In hindsight I should feel sorry for people who can be so rude to you for no apparent reason, must have some personal problems and he has to take it out on the rest of the world.",17,9,4

The only things I would say is your going to have to pay to really enjoy the Mexican food. It's fine dining Mexican and yes it exists believe or not in Scottsdale. No 2.50 bean burrito is sold here. Anyway I had the soup which was rich and creamy with seafood mixed in but not worth $14. The chips and salsa were tasty and the hot salsa was very good with a kick. Portions are small yet very filling. Another con is the seats are hard and not very comfortable. I saw some people getting they're cell phones out to look at the menu because it's so dark inside. So if you get to dine in the patio do it because it's a great atmosphere. My server was black and very professional he knew the menu hands down and was on top of our table the whole time.,0,0,0

I have had the guacamole and I thought it was fine but nothing so special it should be three times the price of guacamole anywhere else.

The cheese plate, on the other hand, I'd say that's where it's at  - the cheese portions were fair and the grilled pan de yuca was warm, soft and delicious!

The pozole was good but while I thought it was cute that the ""heat"" came on the side (you add your own serrano and garnish) I would have liked more of the flavor to come from the kitchen. 

I actually have to say I did NOT like the mahi mahi tacos and it had nothing to do with the size (they ARE small - the tortillas can't be more than 4 inches in diameter but the filling portions are generous). It was the fat little fish sticks that served as the filling --  all I could taste was the batter! By my second taco, I was trying to pick the batter off and come the third - I just gave up and left it in hopes of enjoying dessert.

Dessert was good - I had the churros on the recommendation of the many Yelp reviews I had read and they were OK. I actually preferred the fried bananas - more specifically, the peanut butter mousse that they were plated with! 

OK, I was going to give this place 2 stars but I'm going to round up to 3 with a caveat: For dinner, ""Meh. I've experienced better."" but for sharing a cheese plate, maybe some pozole, a couple margaritas or a romantic setting for dessert with a bottle of wine, it's ""A-OK.",10,6,9

The mood is sultry, dark, and edgy romantic. You are actually inside a converted church, so the remains of the wooden ceiling beams and high structure were preserved. There was minimal decorations, but that just served to enhance the ambience. The red glowing light of the bar area and the candles on the table are really the only source of light in the restaurant. Perfect spot for a sexy date night. 
Starting from the very beginning, the complementary tortillas were fresh and crisp and our drinks were strong. We asked for medium spice level with our shared guacamole appetizer but should have gone up to the next level (wasn't too spicy). The restaurant also serves a REALLY strong ghost pepper sauce if you want a legit kick to your meal. I wasn't too hungry so I can only comment on the shaved kale salad and the grilled street corn side which I had as my entrée. The kale salad was standard- nothing extraordinary. However, the corn was impeccable. Sweet yet spicy. I could have had a few more orders! My girlfriend also recommended the flatiron steak which was juicy and cooked to perfection.

We ordered some tacos. While they were on the light side, in terms of portion, every bite was was brimming with flavor.  The Kobe dog was underwhelming.  It is difficult to make a $12 hot dog taste that much better than its $2 street equivalent.

So, when I see The Mission rated as the best spot in Oldtown Scottsdale, the bar is set fairly high. Unfortunately, my overall impression left me feeling disappointed and underfed. 

As a solo patron, I don't expect the wait staff to prioritize me, but the service staff didn't even acknowledge me for the first 15 minutes after I was promptly seated by the host. No water. No head nod. Nothing. 

I had plenty of time to peruse the menu and settled on the skirt steak tacos. When my waiter finally arrived, he was professional, but brief. I made my order and the food arrived shortly after - maybe 10 minutes. 

The tacos come in threes. 3 tacos - each about 3 inches in diameter. They were quite good and the skirt steak had a wonderful smoke fired \/ grilled flavor that left my mouth watering. Not bad if this was an a la carte menu. However, either it was unclear in the menu that these tacos come with no sides or my waiter did a poor job by not advising me of this otherwise anemic meal.  The average person could have easily eaten 6-10 of these tacos by themselves, but would have otherwise needed at least one side to fill up. 

Ultimately, I was failed by the menu and the waitstaff for what would have otherwise been a pleasurable dining experience.  I look forward to coming back again, but next time asking more questions before ordering.",3,1,0

The company was a 6 star, but that's out of the subject. 

The food was on the uneventful side with some shining accents. The guacamole was good and they mix it at your table, which adds some charm to the deal. Also you can request more or less spiciness which was good too. the avocados weren't as ripe as I would like them, though.

The roast corn gorditas were really tasteful but a little shy on the huitlacoche and really small, specially for $9. 

I ordered the Chimmichurri Marinated Hanger Steak which description in the menu reads as follos: pan de bono + charred leek & scallion soubise + tomatillo salad. OK, the name and elaboration is for the presentation and for the price tag, I guess, but when it comes to flavor, it was more like an OK steak with some undetermined flavor. 

I guess the labeling takes an important place here. If you give a dish a name, like chimichurri and the person who tries it has never try it before, it might be really good. But when you're expecting something and they deliver something else is kind of deceitful.

BTW the grilled street corn was pretty good!

The wine was good. We had the tempranillo Coto (I believe that was the name) and it was really good and inexpensive. I also tried the house melbac (courtesy of a really nice friend of mine :) and it was pretty good as well.

The decor is nice but there are a couple of things that I didn't like. The lightning is super dark, like in I-can't-read-the-menu-dark. The upper walls (where the ac vents are) looks dirty and stained. It might be that it was so dark that it was painting or something else, but it looks dirty to me.

The men's room has just one stall and one urinal. I guess the place was built before the new rules and so on, but more toilet space would be appreciated.

I would go back but I might lower my expectations next time. And I'll make sure that I have awesome company (like this time) because that really helps!",0,1,0

Our table was a bit tight, as we were seated against the wall, but it made no difference as both of the two groups that were seated next to us throughout the nite were cordial and polite, not affecting our dining one bit.

Our entrees were spectacular, and the side order of grits was a stand-out.  The table side guacamole was smooth (and plentiful) and the service, outstanding - almost too outstanding, as I think I was asked if I was finished with my meal about 5 times before I actually was, however I'll take too attentive service over the opposite any day.

At the end of the night, too, the manager was going around pouring small shots of a very fine tequila, just to give the remaining diners a taste and talk about the New Year's tasting menu they'd be serving.  He was a joy to talk to, and his personality was genuine - something that isn't always the case here in the valley (or anywhere, for that matter).

Maybe it was due to having a margarita first, or not being as hungry the 2nd time, but 2 servings + a drink + the chicken tacos was PLENTY of food (I even had to save 1 taco for later). Those cute little itty bitty 3 tacos don't look like a lot of food, but once you pair them with other offerings The Mission has, you will find yourself quite satisfied. 

If you go to The Mission, be sure to bring good friends (or a significant other who doesn't eat like a football player). Be ready for great margaritas, great guacamole, nice servers, and a ""chillaxed"" environment. 

Enjoy!",6,4,6

The patio was  romantic, strung tastefully with clear lights,  lush greenery, and a charming fountain. 

Our server came to greet us immediately. I was incredibly impressed with how much knowledge our server had about the menu(looks like a foreign language) and his ability to help me understand what everything was and what it would taste like. Looking over the drink menu there are so many great options, but I had to try their avocado margarita. Who knew avocados and tequila could go so well together!?  I had the tostadas to start; three crunchy delicious tostadas with all kinds of cheese, chicken, and yummy sauce. I had the salmon for my main entrée, I've never had a better cooked piece of fish.

I absolutely loved the atmosphere, with the dim lighting of different chandeliers and the lit bar area. Service was wonderful, as well - friendly and prompt. We decided to follow the advice from Seftel's review and skip the overpriced items like guacamole and tacos, instead focusing on The Mission's more unique dishes. We started off with the absolutely amazing almejas al vapor - clams, rock shrimp, chorizo, and more in a delicate but pungent broth with grilled bread to soak it up with. For entrees, the swordfish veracruz and the scallop dish both were fantastic. The Mission fries - sweet potato and regular - were the best I've had in the Valley, topping the sweet potato fries at Delux. Typically, Latin restaurants disappoint where dessert is involved, but The Mission is an exception - the pumpkin bread pudding with scotch, caramel, pomegranate, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream was WOW-worthy. I hope this place is here for the long-haul, because we could use more unique restaurants that fill an open niche (in this case, haute Latin American).

TIP 1: Skip the overpriced guacamole, unless you have a party of 4+, and the tiny-portioned tacos.

TIP 2: You might hesitate to order fries at a Latin restaurant, but that would be a mistake. The portion is enough for 4+, and they might possibly be the best fries in the Valley.",2,0,2

I went back for brunch on a Sunday and had a much better experience. I had the Chorizo Scramble, which includes chipotle grits. I am in love with chipotle grits.

We chose this as our only fine dining restaurant for our short trip to celebrate our two year annivesary engagement. I tried making reservations online on opentable.com but when it was full, I called the restaurant and spoke to a nice lady who got me outdoor patio reservations at 8 p.m. on a Thursday night. 

I know it's expensive, but compared to Chicago restaurants, the prices here were worth every penny, and my husband and I thought the prices were fair for the ambiance, and great service. Our waitress had too many tables in my opinion, but she gave everyone fair attention. With a large drink list, we couldn't decide what we wanted, but with some help on flavors, my husband and I got cocktails we both enjoyed along with our dinner. 

We split the corn appetizer dish and the steak taco's. They are the best steak taco's I have ever had. They came in 3, all though we could have requested 4, and a generous amount was on each perfectly cooked corn tortillas. The flavor was intense, I absolutely loved it.

The presentation and taste of our banana dessert was something I don't regret eating regardless of how many calories it had and how full I was.

They sat us right away...as I had made reservations via Open Table, and our server was right there and ready to serve.  The place is always dark with lots of candles and after the sun goes down they will open up the windows.  There is a back patio and it is lit nicely.  Too hot to sit out in the summer.  Now for the food, we order chips and salsa to start...pretty standard, but when they brought in the extra hot salsa.....there you go.  It was awesome!  Way to hot, but if you mix it with the regular salsa, it's good. The guacamole is very, very good.  NIce presentation too, as they make it at your table.

- Tableside Guacamole: Rather overpriced at $12 for 1 avocado's worth of mush but perfectly delicious. Everything tastes very fresh and it had the prefect amount of citrus, garlic, cilantro, and spice. 
- Butternut Squash Tacos: Yummy! I was nervous that the squash would be too sweet but the flavors ended up working very well together and it was a satisfying savory dish. This is the only vegetarian entree, but I don't think vegetarians suffer with this delicious dish. It isn't all that big so definitely order an appetizer or additional side.
- White Bean Puree: Super delicious and kind of like an awesome mexican take on hummus. 
- Espresso Churros with Milkshake: Awesome dessert. I hate coffee flavored desserts and thankfully this one didn't taste a thing like espresso. The churros are warm and soft and taste good on their own or paired with the milkshake. The milkshake is basically a vanilla version of mexican hot chocolate with strong notes of cinnamon and other spices.

Why you ask? The lighting. Mostly because there is none. It was so dark that I squinted as I tried my best to read the menu. Am I old? Do I need reading glasses? Nope, it's just insanely dark in here. The good news is if you're a little worried about appearances, this is the perfect spot to get your heart's desire to fall in love with your personality! Is this a little vapid? Yes. But the dating scene is harsh, and that's why I'm married. I got tired of hiding in dimly lit restaurants. 

You'll be happily greeted with crispy freshly made tortilla chips and salsa which are awesome! I basically ate my weight in chips which I do not regret one bit. Their table side guacamole was not my favorite, but I'm not the biggest avocado fan either so who cares what I think. We ordered the Mexican street corn in a bowl, but next time I'd prefer it on the cob. It just tastes different when you eat it that way, plus you have lots of corn stuck in your teeth which will make everyone feel awkward when you smile at them throughout the meal. Avoid the grilled gem salad. It was chopped up and covered in cheese. Definitely my least favorite dish of the night, mostly because it just wasn't what we expected. If you liked this dish, and we were the last man and woman left on Earth, the human race would die because I would refuse to procreate with you. That's how serious I am when it comes to salad. End of civilization serious.

But on a very serious note, their pork tacos are amazing! You have to order them to feed two people, so if your first date isn't into this, you'll automatically know you should walk away. If they can't agree to collaborate on sharing ten tortillas and a delectable pork shoulder taco feast, how can you possibly expect them to compromise on taxes, kids and doing the dishes. And if they don't want to sprinkle cilantro on top, run as quickly as you can. Everyone knows that people who don't like cilantro are total weirdos and not to be trusted.",15,10,11

From the ambiance to the service to the food, everything was top notch. I was the first to arrive in our party of six. We had a reservation on a very busy Sunday evening and the table was ready and waiting for us in the back of the restaurant. I was greeted right away by our waiter. He came over and took my drink order and brought it out very quickly.

I was able to have a good look at the menu before the rest of the party arrived and good thing that I did because everything looked and sounded so good. When the rest of my party arrived, we decided to get table side guacamole and it was very fresh and delicious. I decided on the short rib tacos and a side of street corn for my entree and both were extremely good. The short rib was melt in your mouth good and the three tacos were perfectly sized. The street corn was served in a spicy chipolte sauce and I could have eaten it for days. I also asked if they had a spicer salsa and our waiter said that he could bring me out a sauce made with ghost chile. I went for it because I LOVE spicy. I knew to use it sparingly and it gave me the zip I was looking for to both my corn and tacos. Two of the people in my party were vegetarians and ordered the butternut squash tacos and absolutely loved them as well.

The manager\/owner also came around to our table to see how we liked our dinner. I though that it was a great personal touch. He was very nice and attentive. Our service was outstanding.

Sure, we have the servers and cooks as producers, the location as our stage, lighting, sound and supporting staff. But the meal, ah, that is our celebrated lead actor. Without it, all other pieces may paint a pretty picture, but what good is a painting when it medium is missing? 

The Mission really delivers its lines well. Almost too well. Like Dakota Fanning well. Each plate has a spectrum of flavors--bold and smoky with subtle and delicate undertones of fresh herbs. Each dish is skillfully plated and ready for its closeup. My steak tacos were so intensely flavored, I didn't really dwell on the fact there were but three petite tortilla shells mounded with strips of magnificently grilled flank steak and slices of fresh avocado. And the papas y chorizo, which I ordered as an accompaniment, helped balance the palate yet was still a strong item on its own. Robert M's pozole was as unique as it was flavorful, delicious, satisfying and, ironically, humble. The bread pudding he ordered at the end of meal was, according to him, a premature ejaculation. Apparently, that means it was good, so I'll take his word for that. Those who joined us for this meal seemed to share some of the enthusiasm over the dessert, but I don't eat sweets so will have to believe their accolades worthy. 

What, pray tell, denies The Mission of the much clamored five-star rating? Primarily, it's the associated fees. On one hand, I was blown away by the sensuous flavors apparent in every edible item. On the other hand, I was blown away upon seeing the bill (especially since I had nothing but water to drink). Does one negate the other? Perhaps. Am I at a place in my life where such a statement rings true? Not necessarily. While my initial response was, I wouldn't likely return to The Mission if it was my decision, I confess that I would, willingly, give myself back to The Mission if only for the sublime sins of doting on sustenance.",8,8,7

Short Story-Great food but smaller than Barbie Sized but full price.

Long Story-

I had the halibut that was over maybe two tablespoons of rice and had a delicious tomato sauce poured around it that tasted similar to Campbell's Soup but better because I couldn't taste the tin can and it had a great layered spice to it that was just right. The top of my fish was sprinkled with some crisp taro threads and my petite halibut was cooked to perfection and seasoned perfect. Vegetables were not a part of this meal ($28)

My husband had the Chorizo Porchetta it was impressive coming out with a flaming rosemary stuck into it, I noticed that it looked like a petite filet  across the table in the dark but was a pork shoulder and the chorizo (a hard style chorizo) was stuffed into it, the plate had a very tiny dish of white bean puree on the side. I am looking at my measuring cups right now and the dish looked like my quarter cup but the dish of beans wasn't filled all the way so it was less than a quarter cup also vegetables were not a part of this entree ($24) 

Both of us and the two tables seated on both sides of us thought it was too dark in the dining room you REALLY HURT your eyes trying to read the menu in such darkness no matter how young or great your eyesight is.
The tables are too close together so much so that you have to pull your table out of the way for people seated on the bench to get out. Service was casual.

We picked The Mission after visiting the sister restaurant (House Brasserie) on the Scottsdale food tour earlier in the week.  The restaurant is beautiful, but the seating is a bit tight.  We enjoyed talking to the couple seated next to us, however, if you're looking for a more private dining experience this might not be the place for you. 

We started with the guacamole, prepared table side.  It was okay but the salsa was actually much better.  Dinner choices include typical meat\/seafood entree dishes or tacos (3 small tacos).  My husband had the Malbec braised short ribs.  It was a very generous portion of meat served on a very minimal portion of a vegetable.  The menu indicated they were ""crispy potatoes"" but they looked and tasted more like a plantain. The tacos I ordered came as described - three small steak tacos.   As a side dish we had a ridiculously large order of mixed regular and sweet potato fries with two dipping sauces.  We ate less than 1\/3 of them, in part because there were just too many and also because they were not as tasty as the rest of the food.  

I can't comment on the drinks, but the menu looked interesting.  The service was great.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful.  Our water and ice tea glasses were filled constantly.  Because of the proximity of tables I could not help but overhear the party next to us and their constant questions and demands of our server.  She handled them all politely and as patiently as she possibly could.  

Overall, I think this is a very solid choice and we would return to try some other dishes.  The service is outstanding",0,0,0

The table side guacamole was incredible...some of the best I've had.   I would say its a must-get every time you go.   Instead of ordering an entree I ordered two appetizers for my dinner.  The reason I did this is because I had these two apps suggested to me by several people - the pork belly pibil and the crispy cola pork.  As you can see, thats a lot of pork belly.  I ate the crispy cola pork first, and it was very tasty.  It was quite sweet from the cola, but it was a nice app.  I probably only ate 1\/3 of the pork belly pibil, but like i said, I think i was just overwhelmed with pork belly.  It was a pretty big block of pork too, maybe enough for a meal in itself.  It was tasty as well, but certainly more fatty than its crispy counterpart. 

You can take my review for what its worth.  I'd say everything I got was worth getting again, but maybe just not all together.",0,0,0

Start with the fresh guacamole made table side to taste. I love it that way. The salsa was delicious as well.

While we had several different dishes, I would highly, highly, highly recommend the duck.  Another table favorite was the pork tacos with the pineapple glaze.  My aunt is quite sensitive to spice and so we asked for ALL of the glaze on the side and it was perfect and very mild.

There are three separate interior dining spaces, along with a small patio, which creates a warm vibe and reduces the bustle and sound levels, creating an intimate setting. The owner Pavle is very welcoming and is a superb host. For a quick weekend in Scottsdale we sat outside for an early afternoon bottle of wine and a cheese & fruit plate, which was off menu but Pavle said ""leave it to me to put something together"" and he delivered. We also took his recommendation for wine, with a Lynch Aligote and both were wonderful. We decided to return for a dinner the following evening, as the menu and wine list read so well. Putting ourselves in Pavle's hands, we had a bottle of champagne from Savoie and a Etna red, both great and well priced. He could have chosen something for $100, and we had a larger budget, but his picks were half that and it is a testament to his ability to deliver consistent value and a high quality experience for his patrons. He also shared a taste of two Chinons, one being a rarer personal selection, which was greatly appreciated. For dining, we put ourselves in his & the chef's hands, and they did not disappoint. Wonderful varied flavors, from the lamb dumplings, falafel plate, pasta, and then to chicken...and I'm writing from memory so I will be general, the cuisine we tried (about 25% of the menu) is a hybrid of ""classic"" Mediterranean (falafel, lamb...) but with Italian ""peasant"" influences (brothy with vegetables), light and flavorful, not heavy, with a ""Grandma's kitchen"" feel where the plating is home-y, large portions, not served with a ""reverence"" you might find at a fancy foodie restaurant. Definitely a warm welcoming feel, where food is more dionysian. Notable: the chicken is sourced from a small farm, we had a breast that was pounded thin, had a wonderful gameier taste and texture, served with a topping best described as a dry salsa, with halves of lightly cooked radish, with wonderful croutons of lightly fried polenta. Fabulous. Highly recommend you visit (& make reservations!...also note he bar has only 3 seats, but Pavle is very accomodating and will work with you).

What an amazing eclectic place, I can't wait to go back, I wanted to try everything, especially the Banana Crab Croquettes. If you don't know what what a banana crab is, it's what 1950's scary movies were made of. They were the most dangerous things at my home around banana plants in Florida. They were the most scariest looking beasts I ever encountered during my childhood, and I never knew you could eat them. Now I want to eat my fears and that is the deadly Banana crab. I suggest you Google them just to take a look at what they look like and you'll say my God.

But back to the Mission. It has great ambience and a great vibe to it, as I thought it would be a rundown all restaurant that caters to tourists, au contraire Mont Freire.

I sat at the bar and the bar service was exceptional, but it was the food that really excited me everything looked amazing and every time I brought it up to the bartender he said hey dude everything here is excellent I can't recommend anything as it's all good. So it was a hard decision I got the pesola soup which was just out of this world and I got the short rib tacos, and they were Great but I felt as if I needed more but I was so full and I was so in love with the menu I didn't know what to do. The more I looked at the menu the more I wanted stuff, so I realized I would just have to go back and eat and eat and eat.

The chef here really has to be commended for creating such an interesting menu. I lived in Mexico for a year and I didn't even see anything close to what he had. It may have been the same food but his menu is written like a romance novel.

I could taste how fresh the tortilla was and the steak was grilled perfectly. We also had another order of the Grilled Street Corn because it was too good to only have once.

We split the spicy caesar salad which was definitely the best part of the meal.  I ordered the short-ribs braised in merlot which were just okay and my friend had the ahi of which I found that the flavor combination didn't work too well.  

Service was the worst part of our experience.  It appeared as though our server was relatively new as she kept referring to notes on wines and food and then got upset with us when she brought us a sparkling wine when we had ordered the still. She was really huffy thinking we were being difficult and took the wine away and when she came back she had the wine list open and was like, ""oh, there is a still of the rose, I thought it only came in sparkling.  All roses are usually sparkling.""  Um...no.   

My friend enjoyed her margarita but you won't find us back here.  I would be willing to overlook the wine mix-up if the food made it worth it.",2,0,1

I use to play in a youth orchestra that was hosted just next door in the old mission and didn't know this was now a restaurant. The ambiance is dim and romantic. Definitely has a Spanish feel. The patio is amazing, especially on a clear, starry, warm night. The patio is cozy with a large brick fireplace, comfortable chairs, and a secluded location a midst downtown Scottsdale. The menu is to die for! So many unique foods: Peruvian clam stew, swordfish, octopus, etc. My friend and I each got a drink- the capirinhia was ok. Nothing special. The cheese place was very tasty and had a lot of variety of flavors to mix, but there wasn't much to eat. My friend got the swordfish entree. Mmm! Very hearty fish with 2 sides. The flavoring and seasoning is what made the dish. I got the Creekside filet *the most expensive dish on the menu*. SO worth it! The filey mignon was cooked rare (though I asked for medium), but again the spices and seasoning were so unique and savory, I took my time enjoying each bite! It came with a side of white bean grits (also very tasty, but filling). If you want a great night out with a group or a romantic dinner for 2, go here.

This is the BEST restaurant in Scottsdale hand down. I am a regular and here is why:
-Amazing ambiance..... dark with lots of candles and a salt brick wall. Really cool music at just the right volume.
-Creative, unique and perfectly executed menu. What makes this place so special is there is literally nothing like it in town.
-Friendly service. In my experience, the servers had strong knowledge of the menu and were real people. At a lot of these nice restaurants service is great but seems a bit fake. People who work here seem comfortable in their own skin and are generally fun to talk to.
-Top notch margaritas! I sat at the bar once and the bar manager Mike took great  care of us. I was pretty sure my girl friend was going to dump me for this guy...he is as smooth as it gets. This guy has to be melting hearts on the reg between his game and the tequila selection.

You walk in through the outdoor patio, which looks cozy with a roaring fireplace. It was a bit too cold for outside, so we opted for indoor seating. It was packed on a Monday night! We put our name down and was told it could be up to an hour wait. The high-top table in the bar looked so inviting that we decided to eat there instead. It gave us a nice view of the place, which had wonderful chandeliers set low over the dining tables. The overall feel was intimate and romantic, with a rockstar edge.

The waitress was phenomenal. Extremely knowledgeable about the menu and passionate about the restaurant. I was thoroughly impressed. Service was excellent.

We ordered their award-winning Blood Orange margarita and the guac to start with. A guy came to the table and made the guac right in front of us. It was a nice touch, but I wish the experience was more interactive. He didn't ask us anything beyond how spicy we wanted it. Other Yelpers rave about the guac. It's okay. :)

For our main dish, we shared the mahi mahi tacos and the pork shoulder. The mahi mahi was perfectly fried. I found myself wanting a sauce of some kind on the tacos. I ended up adding the sweet BBQ sauce from the pork dish. Not the ideal combo, but it worked! The pork dish looked amazing. My companions said the meat was very moist and the self-built tacos were delicious. 

We also ordered the Grilled Street Corn and Black Bean Puree. The street corn is a corn on the cob topped with a rich, spicy, creamy sauce. It was the favorite for all of us. Very, very good. The black bean puree also packed some heat and was tasty.

One of the things that drives me crazy is when the hostess (or one of) is invariably on the phone with someone trying to make or edit a reservation... And she(or most of the time its a she) has the reservation computer tied up and cant be bothered to greet or acknowledge the people in front of them. Here's a thought PUT THEM ON HOLD and talk to us. The couple standing right in front of you for almost 10 minutes. The ones on time for their reservation, with cash in hand... just a thought

On the plus side The Mission called to confirm our reservation and had asked us if there were any food allergies (yes). When our server arrived at the table he had a small printout listing our callouts. How smart is that!!

We ordered the pork shoulder taco portion designed to be shared... Very good and really is enough for 2. 

We had read all these rave reviews of the kitchen street corn so decided to order it as a side dish. Due to a kitchen mix up we actually got 2 portions 1 on the cob the other with just kernels in a bowl. The kernels only is very much the way to go. The corn on the cob looked like lollipops on (not so solid) sticks. It was very messy and cooled quickly... Who wants cold corn on the cob? 

The food and margaritas were both solid, not spectacular with flavor profiles not nearly as complex as Fuego Bistro.

I will preface the rest of my review by saying that our Yelp commandos set up a dinner for the Community Managers in town for Regional Week. Our menu was preset so I'm not aware of the costs.

The weather in Arizona right now is perfect for outdoor eating, so take advantage of it while the gettin' is good. The Mission's outdoor area accommodated around 4-6 tables of our group of over 20 plus as well as other guests not with our party. There was a fire burning in the hearth, probably perfect for when the nights become a little chillier. The owner greeted us by presenting us with a shot of Tequila apparently made by George Clooney (hello!?) and instead of a lime and salt, there was an orange with brown sugar. This is what they call, ""mission style."" Tequila is my enemy, but I sipped the shot and it was very smooth. I mostly ate the orange slice that I assume if I liked tequila would be a great innovative way to shoot it!

While most of our group opted for margs, I went rogue and ordered the red Sangria (though they have white as well) and it was perfect to pair with their chipotle salsa. Though I'm more of a pico de gallo\/limey salsa girl, this one wasn't overly smokey. I have to say their table side guacamole was one of the best I've had. I love me some fresh guac, and if I could've had it for myself or had them make a bath tub of it, that would've rocked my world. 

The first menu item was a petite pork app. Two of our table guests didn't eat pork, and our waiter, Tony, and the owner quickly brought them out other options. The app was a great crunchy texture and various levels of flavor. This was followed by a shaved kale salad. I am a sauce\/dressing junkie, so I could've had more of the dressing, but I understand what they were going for. Then we were presented with three adorable tacos; one pork, one steak and one chicken. The steak was Tecate Skirt Steak, and if you know me you know I love me some Tecate, so that was definitely my favorite with the pork being very similar to the app and the chicken one, probably coming in second place. I would most definitely go back for another round of the steak tacos. 

The service, again, was amazing. They would replace forks on a dime, ask about refills before you took your last couple of sips and they put napkins under our purses that we put on the ground. Something I have never seen, but consider immensely thoughtful. 

I would definitely consider coming back to the Mission for a more upscale Mexican dining experience, especially when the weather is perfect like this. Absolutely perfect for a big group!",4,1,1

I hope it stays on the menu for a while! 

I can't wait for my next excuse to go again! Get reservations early and if you sit on the swamp cooled patio, ask for a table further from the fan unless you enjoy eating your own hair. Aside from that tip, the patio is a great choice!!

I told her I did not follow her explanation of what the arrangement for her  other tables was, (or why I would need to know all this) I was simply calling for a 7:30 reservation.

I also really dig the interior of The Mission. It sort of reminds me of the Alamo, although I only ever went to The Alamo once many years ago so my memories could be wrong.

The atmosphere is tranquil looking but loud with a mixed aged-crowd.
It is apparently customary to be given a small light to look over the menu, because it is so dark . Our server did not offer us one , even after she saw me using my phone. 
Being our first time, (and we even told her it was our first time) she did not run through any specials or anything. I had to ask and she just told me the Chef's recommendation.  The server next to us told his table all the specials that evening.
The guacamole was different with the toasted pepitas in it. It had a nice flavor.
I had the chicken tacos and ordered flour tortillas vs corn. It would have been nice to have been told that I would have had to put everything together myself, vs if I had ordered them with corn tortillas. It came with two flour tortillas and a bowl with the chicken and avocado and then a side of the sauce. The chicken was  a tad dry and overcooked. I have had better tacos elsewhere.
The blood orange pineapple margarita was the best thing I had there. 
The server was not very inviting and seemed uninterested in helping us . She only came around to take the order and check how the guacamole was and then handed us our bill. 
I think there needs to be some improvement on the service.
I would try it again and ask for a different server.",0,0,0

That man is Chef Matt Carter. Part man -part titan, Matt Carter wields his otherworldly craft above all who stand before him, casting a shadow upon the culinary world. It is in the town of Scottsdale where you will find this man; working his magic - constantly revealing new cuisine and enlightening the pallets of those willing to take a pilgrimage. In his sanctuary, Matt Carter brings a taste of Mount Olympus to Prometheus' beloved creation.

By divine twist of fate I stumbled upon The Mission, Matt Carter's take on Latin cuisine. Having conquered dishes the world over, Carter set out on a quest to create the Latin experience in the Heart of Scottsdale, Arizona with a smashing success. Offering a variety of traditional food including Pozole (Mexico) and Anticuchos (Peru) one can literally travel Latin America in one restaurant. From Swordfish Veracruz to the Grilled Sweet Corn, and Braised Shortrib to the splendid array of tacos; The Mission's menu is one of shear cunning and beauty. Each dish is eloquently decorated to match the rich artistic heritage of our neighbors to the south, and carries with them an exquisite flavor leaving you yearning for more. Complimented with a drink selection that not only arouse the curiosity but accommodates those seeking their exotic escape, The Mission creates an experience all will remember.

To complete this unique tour of Latin America, The Mission takes you there with its authentic decor. To bask in the atmosphere of romance is what a trip to this restaurant  will provide. Its rustic ambiance whisks you away to a land rich in culture and decadence. It will truly show you the splendor of our American brothers and sisters.

Hungry and frustrated after 1 hour, I'm docking them 1 star.

Once we were seated, the food was great. The elote corn was really good, it was this sweet cream butter (tasted almost like caramel) on top of the cob, cut in half. The crispy pork with cola lime glaze was also really good- little pieces of juicy pork, sweet with a nice smear of this nutty paste inside a lettuce wrap. These were the 2 best dishes I would get again.

The guacamole was pretty standard, they put garlic, lemon, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and some cheese on top. They only use one avocado, for $12 I didn't think it was worth it. The mission fries were skinny fries served with two sauces- we couldn't finish this, but they were good fries and filling.

We ordered the Blood Orange Margarita, Caipirinha, Table Side Guac, Short Rib Tacos, Mahi Mahi Tacos and the Espresso Churros with a Chocolate Milkshake. The bill came to just under $80. Everything was good but nothing extraordinary. I'd go back one more time to try a real entree but wouldn't reorder any of these things. 

A big side table show was made out of prepping the guac to justify charging $12 for it. Might be cute if you come with kids? The Espresso Churros lacked any hint of Espresso. The Mahi Mahi Tacos had breaded and deep fried tuna on it - no thanks!

As we filled up on chips, we joked that maybe we should have just stopped there and not ordered dinner. Little did we know how right we were going to be. 

We went the tapas route rather than entrees. We ordered... 

Duck carnitas empanada: The shell was tough, not tender and crunchy as it should have been. It also had a very distinct lemon flavor, which was ok, but a little odd. Otherwise, the duck filling was good. 

Roast Corn Gorditas: The little silver dollar size gorditas were, again, tough. Almost inedible. Neither the amount nor the flavor of the topping was enough to overshadow this problem. 

Shrimp Anticuchos: Waaaaaay over cooked. I knew before I bit into it, too. I tried to remove the remaining shell from the tail and the shrimp didn't pull out of it - too dry. 

Chicken Anticuchos: Dry and over cooked. Good flavors, though. 

Beef Anticuchos: This one bright spot for the tapas dishes arrived very late. Hot, juicy, and amazing flavors. But... and this is a big one... The runner who brought it made a point of saying that the kitchen had 'run out' of these and had to make this one fresh. Um, what? Does that explain the other 4 dishes and their awful execution? We just happened to get a bunch of stuff that was pre-prepared and sitting around? Suddenly it all made sense. 

By the time we finished the beef, we were done but not full or satisfied (obviously). We headed off to Grand Luxe (not that many places to go on Christmas Eve, really) and were happier there with a few tapas dishes and dessert. 

And a note for servers: When you ask if everything is ok and everyone chuckles sadistically rather than answer, when you don't follow up, it's obvious you don't care.

In the end, other than the very late dish, service was pretty good. Drinks were good. Chips and guac were excellent. It just felt like the B team was in the kitchen so that the real cooks\/chefs could be home for Christmas Eve. So much potential, but so little execution.",0,0,0

I told her we would show up at 8. We got there at 7:55 and were shown to our table, however it was not the table I had requested. Instead it was a tiny table cramped in between two other table with no room to move. I went back to speak to the hostess and told her that it was not the table we requested. She looked in the system and said that she must have missed the note and asked very rudely, ""Well what would you like me to do, ask the people sitting there to move?"" As bad as I wanted to say yes, I wasn't going to be that guy. I understand restaurants get busy, but I would not have chosen to dine here that evening had I not been assured that we would be seated at the table I requested. We even adjusted our plans to show up early to ensure we would not be rushed. Unfortunately, no matter how good the food was, I will only remember how they screwed up my reservation and acted as if I was an inconvenience. 

That being said, the table side guacamole is very good! The pork shoulder tacos were good, (the pineapple habanero glaze is excellent) but certainly not worth the $32. The Jodori chicken was okay, but nothing great. I would have certainly gone back to try other items on the menu but their lack of attention to detail completely spoiled the experience. I will not be retuning.",6,0,0

First off, it's fine dining as I mentioned above, please don't expect the same meal you get at your local Mexican restaurant. I've noticed at several of these types of places the main complaint is the price, this is much higher quality!

The food is amazing, the table side guacamole is so flavorful, one of the best I've had. The pizole soup is so rich, you will want to take a pot home!

We started with the chicken (thigh) tostadas and the crispy cola pork belly tostadas.  They were great; particularly the pork belly ones.  MAN were those good.  My dinner was the Chorizo Porchetta which brought a big hunk of slow cooked pork that shredded beautifully.

It was a fantastic dish.  The other 6 dishes were just as great.  To note: the honey chipotle grits that my buddy got were super tasty.

- chips and guacamole
- grilled street corn
- pork shoulder tacos (pineapple glaze and cilantro)
- pumpkin bread pudding

Would I Go Again?
Two items highlighted my experience at The Mission: chips and guac, and pumpkin bread pudding.

Chips and Guacamole
To begin, they bring out a big rolling cart and make the guacamole right in front of your table.  I watched him open up the avocado and add pine nuts, cilantro, etc., and then he mashed it all together.  When I took my first bite, then I quickly realized I should have taken a video of making the guac.  It was amazing, and now I have no idea how to recreate it.  (I'm sure I couldn't anyway, but it's fun to think about.)  The all-important consistency was on point.  It was not chunky, but there were still enough chunks of avocado to remind you that the guac was homemade rather as opposed to the creamy, Cool Whip-like texture of guac from a mix.  The guac was awesome--the pine nuts, cilantro, and other juices and spices were perfect.

Pumpkin Bread
I'm not a pumpkin bread connoisseur by any stretch, but I would confidently challenge any other restaurant's pumpkin bread pudding to hang with The Mission's.  The baked edges, caramel sauce, and ice crea made me yearn for more.  If only I hadn't filled up on the chips and guac!  Sometimes the toughest choices in life are between two good things, right?

The rest of the meal was just sub-par.  The Mission is supposedly famous for its pork shoulder tacos, but I thought they were bland and dry.  The grilled street corn was very good but I can't imagine ever getting too fired up about corn.  

Simply put, I would highly recommend The Mission to anyone living or staying in the Scottsdale area, and I would especially recommend the chips and guac and pumpkin bread pudding.",0,0,0

We had the duck empanadas for an app and they were very good, but rich because of the foie gras.  My son also had a delicious soup but I don't remember the name.  I had the scallops for an entree and my son had the filet.  Both were fantastic.  I had asked for the scallops to be well done and they were but still moist.

Inside, it's ""shabby chic"" meets St. Mary's Basilica with votive candles burning, crystal chandeliers and whitewashed furnishings.  There are interesting and unusual seating areas throughout the dining room.  My favorite - tables near a cozy fireplace in the front courtyard - so comfortable and inviting.  The patio, where we sat was quiet and comfortable as well.  This place gets six stars for ambiance.

Service was top notch too, Tony served us and others filled in when he got pulled to another table.  The tequila and wine selection was large and varied.  We started with a few signature margaritas and mojitos.  The prices seemed reasonable based on the portion sizes we saw being distributed around the room. The menu is small but filled with interesting options from the standards to the sublime.

We began with the obligatory guacamole, made table side, and an order of Mexican street corn.  Both were uniquely flavored with unexpected ingredients (who puts pumpkin seeds in guacamole?!? - I will from now on!).  

We were already getting filled up on the great chips and mole-like sauce they put on the table so we kept it light and ordered tacos for our main courses, short rib, skirt steak, mahi mahi on top of small hand made corn tortillas - loved them all.  We ordered a few sides too - papetes with chorizo and chipotle grits (unbelievable flavor and texture!).

The salsa has a nice smoky flavor to it and it just thick enough so stay on the tortilla chips.
We usually order the pork shoulder taco platter which comes with all the fixings to make ten miniature tacos with.  $32.00
The pork shoulder is served more room temperature, so if you want it hot I recommend you ask for it to be heated prior to serving. 
For two people one order is plenty, therefore, if you like guacamole (and they make it table side how you like it there), you may find it a stretch to finish the taco platter.  
Table side Guacamole:  $12.00
It can get noisy at The Mission, so if you are going to an intimate meal or a dinner meeting I do not recommend it.
This is a great place to grab lunch or a Margarita at dinner after enjoying Old Town.  There is a lot of history at the restaurant so it is worth exploring that prior to going so you can appreciate what you are seeing or a part of when you are there. 
Tables are small is one of my complaints.  The serving dishes they use for their menu items wind up being crammed onto the table leaving little room for a cocktail and a glass of water making the meal less enjoyable.

The minute we walked in, I was a fan! I adored the chandeliers, the lighting, and all the other little details throughout the restaurant. Our waiter, Angel, was extraordinarily personable and accommodating. 

We started off our brunch with the fresh guac, made-to-order at your table. it was AMAZING! I could have just eaten it out of the bowl and called it a day. Several of my friends ordered the Pollo a La Brasa y Waffles. I had to try a bite and must say, the waffles were to DIE for! Pure maple with bits of bacon, poured over a cinnamon waffle?! Yes pleaseeeeeeeeeeee! Too bad I am on a competition diet. with that said, the kitchen was able to accommodate my special diet and prepared me a breakfast plate with grilled chicken and egg whites. I tried the grits that came on the side, and they were creamy deliciousness for sure! The Chilaquiles looked incredible and, based on feedback, both the red AND green were very tasty. 

I absolutely recommend The Mission to anyone looking for a great place for brunch. I would also HIGHLY recommend making reservations. I made mine a week in advance and was glad I did... the place really fills up quickly around 11:30!",0,0,1

The interior is beautiful - the inside portion is slightly dark and romantic, while the outside areas are a shaded and well-ventilated, with some modern white decor. Definitely made me feel like I was escaping to somewhere exotic.

The drinks. Oh man.
First off, try the aguacate.
Yes, it has avocado, but as per the waiter, the avocado just makes it creamy and masks the taste of alcohol.  Really good.
I got the Elderflower Paloma - tequila, grapefruit juice, and my fave St. Germain. 

We ordered the ""Tableside Guac."" It's a bit of a cool experience, when it comes to freshly made guacamole. Is it bougie as hell? You bet! But it was delicious chunky guac.

The service was great - we were a party of 9, so I was glad that we got seated quickly (it was Monday after lunch though), and that the staff was attentive but not overly bothersome, you know? And thank you for being willing to split the food-I split the chicken torta, while another friend split the Aguacate, and the restaurant was very willing to do that.",6,1,2

But after sampling the stew at  Yelp in Bloom, he was open to giving it another shot.  And this time, it did not disappoint either of us.

I have to give 5 stars for the Primarita.  I was hesitant given it has something like half the calories of a standard margarita.  Half the calories and twice as good!  A couple of these and I can almost forgive the price of the guacamole.

After Yelp in Bloom, we had to order the Almejas Al Vapor, that delightfully spicy peruvian stew.  Definitely enough for two and served with plenty of bread to soak up all that broth.  That tends to help keep patrons from drinking from their bowl I'm sure.  We also tried the tostadas prepared with chicken thigh and black beans.  Delicious, but maybe piled just a little too high.  More stuff ended up on my plate than in my mouth with every bite.  Maybe they should line the plate with a tortilla so I could just roll up all the stragglers at the end.  Less forks to wash that way, too.  The grilled street corn was right up there on the good scale with everything else, as well.

I ordered the a soup that the waitress said would be very hearty. The soup  tasted. . . well, it had no taste.  It was like watery broth with tasteless pork at the bottom. Not good and not hearty.

I told the waitress that I did not like it and she said, "" Oh, bummer. Can I bring you something else?""  Since everyone was almost done with their meals I declined and just ate chips and salsa.

But for our fourth visit, we went for a four course tequila tasting dinner for $65.  With tip and tax, $85.

Considering we spent that much on most of our ""yelp eats"" event dinners, all of which were three courses, each far less decadent and with no booze included, this was a GREAT deal...

Dos Lunas was the tequila brand hosting the event...

First Course: Roasted Pork Belly.  We had the pork belly during yelp eats.  That one was intense.  This one was even better!  And spicy from the Chile tepin.  It was on a peanut butter cream sauce, which may sound odd, but the heat, the peanut, the cherry margarita...  Wow.  If that was the best course, I was already satisfied.

First Course Drink: 5 small Cherry Margaritas.  FIVE.  EACH.  YUM.  We kept drinking them before the food got there and they felt compelled to refill us four times. :)  The cherry with the peanut cream sauce meal was an amazing compliment!

Second Course: Even better than the first!  I didn't think it could get better than the pork belly, but it did: Halibut.  It was perfectly cooked and had intense flavor. It was served over risotto that made my spine tingle with every bite!

Second Course Drink: Pineapple Coconut Frozen Margarita.  It was a lot like a pina colada.  Tasty.  Though large it went down fast!  I didn't feel it did anything for the Halibut the way the first drink did for the pork belly.

Third Course: It seemed impossible, but the third course better yet again. Filet Mignon.  And they don't even have that on their menu.  It tasted peppery, buttery, spicy and just so atypically full of flavor!  And of course it was the perfect tenderness.  It was topped with crab that was so succulent I finally had to scoop it off and eat it as two succulent courses to enjoy everything they offered.

Third Course Drink: A flight of three shots of Tequila: Silver, Reposado, Anejo.  The only difference: how long they sit in the barrel. 18 months for the anejo.  Three quick shots of tequila are always a great idea!  And the perfect compliment to that spicy filet.

Fourth Course: Stone Fruit Crumble Cake: the cake was ok.  It was topped with a Rum ice cream that was so potent I felt I was doing shots.  Rum after all that tequila wasn't the most exciting finale.  The dessert was the only let down, but with those first three courses, who cares!! :)

Fourth Course Drink: Iced Espresso Tequila Drink.  I am not a coffee fan, so I had to basically shoot this sucker down.  But everyone else seemed to really enjoy it.

Absolutely worth $85.

And then the finale came.  They let us have a half sized shot of the Dos Lunas Grand Reserve.  A 750ml (25oz) bottle costs $3000.  So a single 1oz shot of that would run over $120 retail, up to $500 in a resort bar.  So all by itself, this was more than we paid for the whole meal!  It tasted more like a cognac and not at all like an 11 year old tequila.  I would never pay that much for a shot, but man it was pretty cool to have.

GREAT event at the Mission.",1,1,2

I found The Mission while looking for upscale Hispanic cuisine during my trip to AZ. From the pictures and some reviews, it seems like a great place to eat, and it really would be if the staff and chef were replaced. We had multiple customer service issues that spanned across multiple employees.
-First we came 1 hour and a half earlier of our reservation so we arrange to sit at the bar and socialize until our table was ready. The hostess advised that she could get us something much Sooner than our original reservation, and offered to notify us at the bar when she was ready to seat us. Almost 45 minutes later the waitress never came to us and offer to seat us, so we walked back to the hostess stand and asked of something opened yet. The hostess said ""go ahead and close out of your tab and we'll get your table ready"". So she forgot about us. We closed out our tab and then went to the hostess stand, at which time we were told to wait a few minutes because a table wasn't ready just yet. A few minutes went buy and one of the girls began to walk us back then said ""oh wait they're still clearing the table"". This was sloppy from the start, but was willing to give it a chance, because the food sounded so good.
- We were sat at the outside patio area. It was pretty chilly out, and they did have multiple heaters outside to counter the nippy air. A few minutes into our meal we both felt a little chilly, but didn't really make an issue out of it, however, the waitress noticed my girlfriend holding her arms like she was cold, and attempted to turn the heater up, but it seemed like it was running out of gas. A group of 8 sat next to us on the opposite side of the heater and one of them made a comment about the heater needing to be turned up. Their waiter put that request on the back burner and said he would do that in a bit and began taking orders from the rest of the table instead of prioritizing the physical comfort of the guests. The same patrons from that table brought the heater up for a second time after he took all of the orders. Smh, VERY poor decision there.
-The food. Oh the food, smh. I got the duck confit, and my girlfriend got the pork shoulder tacos. The tacos were just, okay, nothing to write home about, but the duck confit was bad. Whoever thought it was a good Idea to deep fry it and turn it into chewy duck chicharones needs to go back to culinary school. I felt like I should have been paid to chew through that leathery, crunchy fowl for an hour like I did. We also ordered the chocolate churros, and man were they oily. Like, have you folks even tried those things? They taste like they were fried, then fried again just to let them soak up more oil. They were really bad. 
-When handling the check my girlfriend and I split it down the middle, so when the waitress asked us what we wanted to do, my girlfriend and I both said ""yeah we'll just split it down the middle"". The waitress then replied with ""Okay are you sure thats what you want to do?"". I reassured her that it was, then me and my girlfriend both looked at each other with wide eyes like ""what was that weirdness all about?"". Never had someone ask me if I was sure how I wanted to pay for my bill.... Awkward, but then again, it seemed to go along with the overall trend of this place, which was awkward. When I got my bill back I noticed a pamphlet advertising that the restaurant was hiring, and a questionnaire with questions like ""was a manager visible? This was awkward advertising and questioning for an establishment of this size and style. It was also Ironic, because a manager should have spotted the fact that our heater was running out of gas, seeing as it was clearly dim compared to the others.

The Mission was on every ""top"" or ""best of"" list I read and it was recommended to me by a few people as well. I consider myself to be a fairly cool kid too, and I'm not afraid to be the lone person to say ""This place really isn't all that!"" 

The ambiance is one thing The Mission has going for them. With its many chandeliers, rich tones, outdoor patios... it's a beautiful establishment. Our server looked like he could be Adam Levine's brother, so needless to say, I was okay with that as well. I really can't comment on his actual service because every time he came to our table, all I could think about was the fact that it felt like we were having a discussion with Mr. Levine himself. 

The food was pretty much a miss for me. Overrated mexican frou frou food is how I would describe it. They had the basics down... the chips and salsa along with our margaritas were good, but those are hard to mess up. Entrees either do not come with a side or with one small side, depending on what you choose. Sides are available a la carte for $6.00 each. My husband wanted the flat iron steak, which came with an extremely small tomatilla salad. He actually had to turn his plate toward me just so I could see it, as it was hidden behind his steak... a sign it was way too small. I tried a bite of his steak, but did not care for it at all. I'm very picky when it comes to meat and this was not lean enough for my liking. Very few items stood out to me on the menu, but I ended up selecting the mahi mahi tacos and a side of poblano grits. The tacos here are also very small. Three come to an order and they are roughly the size of an english muffin when laid out. Here's the funny part: they tasted exactly like the Gorton's fish sticks sandwiches I use to eat as a kid. I didn't like fish sticks and the only way I'd eat them was on bread with cheese and mayo to mask the flavor. It's a bad sign to be reminded of a childhood fish stick sandwich while trying to enjoy $14 tacos from this ""exceptional"" restaurant. Needless to say, half of my tacos were left on my plate. I did really enjoy the grits, but they should be a supporting cast member, not the star of the show. We did try the pumpkin bread pudding for dessert as well, and it helped save the meal. The pumpkin flavor really shined in this moist dessert.

So now it's up to you. Do you follow the hype, give The Mission a shot, and rave about it with all the other cool kids? Or do you see it for what it truly is? Simply a place to be seen with mediocre and overpriced food.",5,2,2

\/Service
When I first arrived I was greeted in a very personable way. I was promptly seated and soon our waitress arrived. Let's talk about the waitress for a second. Professional and personable, and did not hesitate to give her own opinion on dishes and drinks.. neither did she say anything negative on anything on the menu, but that is her job after all. I think the service was great, absolutely great. 

\/Food
The food was excellent. The tacos are small, very small.. like taco sliders, but they are tasty. Dont be discouraged by that fact. I went with the chorizo filled pork - I wouldn't recommend it, but I loved the set up, the presentation, how fresh it seemed. But if there is one thing that is a must to try at this place, it is the tableside guacamole. They mix it before your eyes and you can comment and suggest yourself, and the result was amazing.

\/Drinks
I think the drinks are too expensive. Yes, this is Scottsdale and you have to accept this fact - but I am saying this because despite the raving about the mixologist, I just wasn't impressed. Plus one for ingenuity, minus one for drink list limitation. 

\/Ambience
Fantastique. No but really, it is really good and the service (as I already over sold) plays a big part of this. They are the life of the atmosphere. But the layout is cool and they have focused on making this cozy and intimate, but not too intimate. They have found the baby bear kind of middle ground.. (you know, Goldilocks?)",2,1,2

We decided to go here for some appetizers and drinks since it was still early and then head out to another recommended restaurant later.

The food: We ordered the Table side guac and the crispy pork w\/cola lime glaze.  The guac was excellent, and we couldn't get enough, but the real surprise was the salsa that they brought over when we got there.  This salsa was AWESOME.  The waitress mentioned that they roast the tomatoes and make their own salsa at the restaurant.  If I thought for a second I could get it on the plane home I would have asked her give me a cup of it for the road.  SO GOOD.  Then we had the crispy pork, which was a perfectly cooked pork belly thing with sweet barbecue type sauce (but better!) on it.  So good.  We should have stayed here and had dinner instead of going somewhere else.  After we finished dinner at the other restaurant I suggested (only half joking) that we go back to The Mission and have a second dinner... but it was too late.

The decor of the restaurant was really cool, very dark.  Unfortunately, I was there with another male co-worker, so the ambiance was a bit wasted on us...

Having said this, we cancelled our 6:15 reservation this year because for the second year in a row they called us to confirm our dining time (no problem there) to also tell us that there is an 8pm reservation for our table afterwards!!! This is tacky and insulting to immediately let us know BEFORE WE HAVE EVEN SET FOOT in the place  that there is a time limit on our meal; and having the pressure of knowing we better not linger already ruined our experience!

I live in San Francisco where dining out is a way of life and no establishment would ever pull this crap on their patrons - basically putting the onus on us to manage their table turnover - ridiculous!!!!  Maybe the Mission should put egg timers in the shape of avocados on each table, and when the alarm goes off, the customer has to spit out the food in his mouth and  immediately hand over his credit card and flee the premises!

2. Duck Carnitas Empanada - a huge empanada, cut into 3 pieces. Another disappointment as it was swimming in too much sauce.

I was introduced to some lovely people at the event, and spent some time chatting and enjoying the atmosphere; The Mission has a very carefully balanced feel that straddles the line between hip and old world in a charming and successful way. 

There were some unreasonably delicious snacks served too - crunchy tortilla chips with a salsa that tasted like it had been roasted and sprinkled with fairy dust, and the best guacamole of my life. No joke. Locals likely have a lot more experience than I do, but as a Brit who moved to Vancouver I haven't experienced a lot that have blown my socks off. Now, I wasn't wearing socks the night I went to The Mission, but when I got home all of my socks were in disarray; I think you get the picture! The guac was rich, creamy, and incredibly fresh tasting with a plethora of yummy tastes that all danced together in a happy boogie. Go try it immediately!

Its menu and good reviews drew us in immediately.  Old Town Scottsdale is also such a great fun place, we just had to go back to have our last hurrah there.

After not being able to make a reservation as it was completely booked, we were pleasantly surprised when the hostess found us a table for two just as walk ins.

We ordered a couple of beers and decided to get the two appetizers that grabbed us the most.  The Duck Carnita Empanada and the Pazole.  When my wife got the empanada, she immediately realized there  was no way she could eat that then an entree after it.  It was a very large portion and rich\/heavy.  I didn't mind that so we switched and she took the pazole.  After a few spoonfuls she told me it was very salty.  I was surprised because we are salt fiends and never complain about saltiness.  I took a few spoons and yes, it was extremely salty.  Inedible salty.  If you have ever had Kalua pork at a luau, you would know that it is very salty, but in a pleasant way.  This was way more salty than that.  We told the server and he immediately said they would take it off the bill.  Considering the reputation, I would have thought they would offer a free drink or desert, but that is ok.  Anyway, my empanada was good, just very filling, and unfortunately I ordered the Duck Confit for dinner, so double rich duck dishes.  My wife got the snapper which  was extremely good and made up for the salty pazole.  I was relieved.  I thought maybe we hit a place that was all hype, but no, this place is legit and very good. They just probably had one of those moments where someone in the kitchen didn't taste before sending out the dish.  I will never hold that against a restaurant the first time.

We were too full for desert, so that was it.  The place was super busy, hip, and dimly lit, which we like.  Service was very good.  Dammit though, I was really looking forward to my 2nd ever bowl of Pazole.  My first was while visiting AZ last year and I had been craving it since.

I suppose if you go there to romance someone the candle lit dimness sets a certain kind of ambience. But if you are there like me to get some serious grub, the darkness is just plain annoying. 

Ok now lets talk about food. Its just too bad the other half and I are not big eaters, otherwise we would have ordered a lot more than the table-side guacamole, kale salad, street corn and mahi mahi tacos.

The eye-rolling-inducing guacamole is nothing to write home about. Something one can easily make at home or get in one of the many tacquerias for half the price. Now, the Kale Salad. Ah the Kale Salad with its julienned- cut kale, cleverly sized bits of blood orange, roasted peppitos, peeled whole little tomatoes and dressing that erred a little to the overwhelming side.  This is one of those meals that made me think about the process of creating the food. Man, I wish I knew how to perfectly peel the skin of a little tomato without crushing the tomatoes or how do I take the bitterness of uncooked kale into a salad that has a myriad of wonderful textures and flavor. I really really appreciated the bitter chewy bits of the blood orange because by itself would have made me upset but paired with the rest of the salad, the combo just worked.  Did I mention I really like this salad?

The Mahi Mahi Taco was interesting. The juxtaposition of the large battered mahi with the tiny taco made me wonder but when I bit into it, I understood the intention was to highlight the fish and the other condiments compliment the fish.  Too bad I don't like greasy fish too much, otherwise I'd enjoy this dish a bit more.

I asked my Street Corn to be stripped from its cob. I like corn. I am guessing the appeal of this side dish is the mayo-based sauce. Meh. I am okay with it.

I'd give 4 stars for the Kale Salad alone but service plus darkness.. hmm 3 stars is generous.",2,0,0

The services was impeccable. Everyone was very friendly, very helpful and definitely very patient.
Food, did not have a single bad dish. Definitely order the guacamole which was phenomenon, then shared the pork tacos which was to it's perfection.

There were certain ingredients that I never thought would pair well but this dish was very nicely done. Then the side of ""MISSION FRIES"" omg maybe I should of not order these because the size was just insane. But glad I did since the taste was even better. 
All in all, I definitely come back here again. Everyone was very friendly that when I made the reservations they asked if it was a occasion and I told them it was a birthday dinner, when the time came to order desserts, no I didn't get the churros because as a birthday ""cake"" they served some sort of pumpkin cake with ice cream and pomragrated seeds on top that was just O.M.F.G.

To start it was a 45 minute wait on a Saturday night at 8:30... Totally typical! We snagged a seat at the bar and had a glass of bubbles and a mission mule - excellent. Our wait was about 25 minutes and then we were seated in a snug spot with two tables right next to us (only con about this place). For an appetizer we got the table guac... AH-MAZING... A young man came and made it right in front of us... He even asked our preference on how we like the guac. We then got the duck entree and short rib entree - YUM!

We both ordered tacos and while they were beautifully presented, neither of us were blown away by the flavors.  The portions were smallish and not very hearty.

The Mission does a wonderful job of combining various Latin cultures' cuisine into a dish to make it their own.  I got the chicken tacos, which sounds boring, but they were extraordinary.  They are served with an aji amarillo sauce.  Aji is a common Peruvian pepper, which has a wonderful and unique flavor, but I've never seen it on tacos before, since tacos aren't part of Peru's cuisine.

I've been here on Sundays for the ""Pig Out"" all you can eat pork event which is great.

This recent visit they were offering a five course fixed menu with wine pairings for $65\/person.  I love these type events because the chef can experiment with new recipes and as a guest I get to try many new flavors and wines.

This meal progressed from scallops to roasted guinea hen to halibut to Berkshire pork to chocolate cake.  My favorite was the pork and least favorite course was the chocolate cake with the lime sorbet.

We also had the Duck Carnitas Empanadas (DELICIOUS), the Guacamole and also Chicken, Beef and Shrimp Anticuchos or skewers which were good but not as unique as the Duck or Pork. Most everything is served with an aioli which really puts on the finishing touch.

For the main entree I had Swordfish Veracruz which was presented as a trio...Rice...Swordfish...Popcorn Shrimp(cocktail style, not fried). AND GET THIS - they garnished the shrimp with ACTUAL POPCORN. Very creative. But most importantly, well balanced spice, perfect portion and incredible flavor. 

We tried three desserts, the Espresso Churros, Pumpkin Bread Pudding and Fried Bananas. My favorite were hands down the fried bananas...they were in a chocolate crepe of sort and had amazing flavor.

$32 for ten tiny tacos with pork shoulder supposedly for two.  Each taco was two bites and my husband did the math.  It was so dark that the waiter gave us a flashlight to read the menu.  We were given the Bum's rush after our last bite of food.  The portions were so small that it didn't take us long to eat so we hadn't had time to visit with our friends.  The manger came to ""push us out the door"" No pretense about inquiring about our food or service.  $12 for chips for two?  We will return to our favorite Mexican restuarant where the chips and salsa are your welcome to the restuarant.  The Mission won't last.  It is definately not a family restuarant.

It would be a great place to go on a date or out to dinner for ladies night. The chips were delicious and the salsa was too, it was a chipotle salsa which is different than the normal restaurant salsa. The guacamole is made freshly in  front of you and it was fabulous. I had the shrimp tacos and was very surprised at how tastey they were. They were upscale street tacos, battered in a sweet breading topped with cabbage, a heavenly sauce, cotijo cheese, avocado and a thin red bell pepper. They are tiny, but filling.

The food: Outstanding.  We started with chips & salsa, guacamole, and chicken anticuchos.  The salsa was one of the best we've ever had.  The guac, made fresh tableside, was to die for.  The chips?  Homemade and still warm.  The anticuchos were perfectly seasoned, on a bed of deliciously spicy mole, and just the right portion for a starter.  We were impressed and we hadn't even gotten to the main event!

I ordered the citrus-cured Chilean salmon.  Incredible.  Also, ""huitlacoche & sweet corn puree"" does not adequately prepare one for the smoky bites of heaven that are the side dish to the slightly caramelized fish.  My boyfriend ordered the chorizo porchetta, so melt-in-your-mouth tender that you could cut it with a fork.  Everything was beautifully plated, in portion sizes that are appropriate for such rich, flavorful food.

We left no room for dessert, but we can vouch for the bar:  fantastic cocktails (Bitter Bees was a really good one), and if you're a white wine drinker, either of the albarinos are great, but the Licia was a perfect pair with the rich salmon.

The atmosphere\/service:  The restaurant is gorgeous, elegantly dark with chandeliers and a glowing salt wall.  It is also very warm;  we opted to sit outdoors.  Perfect choice - we dined under the stars, next to a fireplace.  Patio heaters keep the area comfortable.  The outdoor area is mostly lit by candles, so it can be a bit dark;  our waitress gave us a small flashlight, to make menu-reading easier, without us having to ask for such a thing.

It is loud - though slightly less so outdoors than in - and the service was pretty good for how crowded it was.  We were early for our reservations, and still were seated almost immediately.  (And I was surprised how busy they were, on a Monday night, when all the other restaurants in that area of Scottsdale were dead quiet... I think it speaks to the quality of food here!)

All in all, it was a top-rate dining experience, and a perfect start to our vacation - if we lived in the area, we'd go back again and again.",0,0,0

That being said - yesterdays experience could not have been more disappointing.  We were seated outside - which was great.  20 minutes between when we were seated and when someone actually spoke to us.  5 minutes later, the water arrives.  At that point a DIFFERENT waitress then our own comes up and can sense our being annoyed and very nicely asks if she can help.  She takes our drink order.  10 more minutes go by and she again comes up and says ""no one has brought you your drinks""...to which we say no, and finally several minutes later our regular waitress comes up with the drinks (we are now over 30 minutes into this ordeal) and smiles and acts like nothing has happened.  I overheard two other tables complaining of the same - it was 3 in the afternoon - its not like they were overly busy!  Outside tables were full in the front of the restaurant but about 40% full inside and outback.

So as we were frustrated, we discussed how one of the unfornate things about YELP is that managers of restaurants are not given the opportunity to fix things at the time of the event.  So we talk to the manager and let him (BRYAN ADAMS) what has transpired.  He appologizes and says he wants to do something for us.  We say that isnt really necessary, as that is not the point of the complaint.  He insists, and says he will speak to our server and adjust our bill.  We proceed to pay the unadjusted bill when it arrives because just like our server, he does NOTHING about this.  

Note to the mission....when you are paying $12 for a bowl of guac, no matter how good it is, people are going to stop coming if you cant get it right.  The only saving grace for the MIssion yesterday was the younger friendlier waitress that seemed to care more than the waitress or the manager.",2,0,0

I know for a fact, that the Mission claims to have some of the best Posole (or pozole, which ever you prefer) around.  Well, not anymore.  Distrito has them beat, hands down.  After tasting the pozole at Distrito, which features an unexpected garnish of littleneck clams), the pozole at The Mission seems bland and ordinary at best.  

Also, after having eaten at several other upscale Mexican restaurants as of late, the food at The Mission only seems to become increasingly more over priced in comparison.  The new restaurant featuring Mayan\/Aztec cuisine on Scottsdale and Thomas, Caldero, offers equally delicious food at much better prices.  Sure, the ambience isn't near as upscale or unique there, but personally, I go out to eat for a good meal, not the decoration. 

If you're looking for small portions as exorbitant prices, then yes, The Mission is for you.  If not, then look else where.",0,1,0

I couldn't believe how crowded this place was for being 8pm on a Tuesday.  We didn't want to wait 30 minutes for a table inside so we sat on the patio.  It was hot as heck outside but they had an AC unit out there and it actually wasn't bad at all.

We didn't order any drinks but I am for sure next time.  I have to try one of their margaritas.  

Here is a rundown of the eats:

*Chips = fresh and perfectly salted

*Salsa = just eh - it had almost no spice and tasted too tomato pasty for me

*Guacamole = phenomenal - they make it table side and you can make it exactly how you like it which in my case was with all the fixins' and spicy - it was awesome, just awesome

* Poblano Grits = creamy and delicious

* Street Corn = o-m-g - this was my favorite.  I could probably eat buckets of the stuff.  The sauce stuff they put on it is just amazing creamy spicy goodness.  Probably not too healthy though but it doesn't matter because it was fantastic.

* Tacos (I tried the chicken, steak and squash) = very very good.  The only problem is that they were tiny.  They are literally 2 inches in diameter and at over 4 bucks a pop (you get 3) it kind of pissed me off.  I know it is more than enough food but it still angered me.  Anyway, each one I had was excellent.  The meat was perfectly flavored and juicy and all the ingredients on the taco worked well together.

I also loved our waiter.  He was very friendly, funny and engaging.  He was so passionate about the place and its food it was almost as if he was the owner or had a stake in the place.

Enough said.  I cannot wait to return.  I'm still pissed about the size and price of those tacos though.",5,3,3

The wait-staff was also very friendly and they all seemed to be working together so you're not just relying on your one waiter.   As for the food, it was very good.  We ordered the guacamole per suggestions on Yelp.  It's made at your table and taste very fresh and was probably the closest thing I've ever eaten to actual guacamole.  My father and I also ordered the tacos, which were a good size and the meat was very tender, not fatty and had good flavor.  My boyfriend had the larger order of tacos where you are given meat, and tortillas on a slab of rock salt and you assemble your own tacos...basically what my father and I had except way more food.  If you can eat a lot I would go for it!  Overall, I would go back.  The prices aren't the cheapest, but the atmosphere is really nice and chic and the food is really good.

I'll admit, even I took a second glance at the clean-shaven stud that took especially careful care of the ladies... and gents, in our group. Dude delivered the goods in style. But, gee, I must've been the only one who was thinking about the meat inside the folds of those tacos after we left. Seriously flavorful delights, folks. Dine on the swine, for sure, it simply knocks the other land-based meats, chicken and steak, out of the water. This goes for the domestic style corn wraps and the crunchy lettuce wraps, equally. Artistically rendered and inspired plates abound at the Mission. And I'll drop a big thumbs up for the kale salad, I thought it was fabulous; this admission surely wins me Metrosexual points, yes? 

Finally, the drinks. As a general rule, the further you wander from the familiar path, here, the better. While everyone was quite comforted by the house specialty margarita (and it was tasty), I found much more complexity and delight in the unusual options on the menu.

I wanted to LOVE The Mission, I really did, but unfortunately we must've gone on an ""off night"" or something because our experience was a mixed bag. Let me start from the beginning. We were greeted by an awesome hostess with great energy who was extremely welcoming - kudos to her!! We were seated shortly after arriving and our waitress was also very friendly and honest in her recommendations, no complaints with the staff at all. The ambiance of this place is extremely romantic and interesting -  chandeliers, leather covered menus, etc. Beautiful. 

The food descriptions were elegantly worded and ingredients sounded like they were offering great dishes!!! ...we were not served any of said great dishes. We started with the duck and foie gras empanadas. Foie gras is really having a moment right now and i understand why restaurants are clamoring to have it on their menus, unfortunately it felt forced on this dish. It wasn't necessary and it barely made a showing to be honest. I am a total foodie and have been enjoying dishes foie gras is the star (foie gras and waffles at the Black Hoof in Toronto or the foie gras mousse at Lolita in Cleveland for example) so having it as a garnish on an empanada didn't really do it justice in my opinion. Otherwise, the dish was fine. The real issue came with our entrees. My husband ordered the steak tacos and I ordered the porchetta - both sounded delicious!! - neither were. His steak was basically uncooked\/rare in the center giving it an extremely chewy\/soft texture, not to mention the steak was COLD. He didn't even finish the 3 small tacos. To quote him after his first bite ""I think they microwaved my steak."" I ordered the chorizo stuffed porchetta and I was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately, the majority of the cut was pure fat and what wasn't fat (or chorizo) was very dry. I'm not sure what happened, but whatever it was, it was disappointing to say the least. The couple next to us was seated after us and their food came out before ours, so I'm wondering if maybe our ticket got lost and they rushed to get our food out? I hope it was something like that, although I'd much rather wait for wonderful food than have mediocre food served to me quickly. 

The saving grace of the meal were the margaritas, they were excellent. I went out on a limb and tried the avocado margarita - who has ever had an avocado margarita?! It was really good. It was slightly creamy in texture compared to a slushy marg, but that didn't phase me. I ordered a second. Yum. My husband enjoyed his drinks as well. Between the drinks, ambiance and staff I think that a 2 star review is fair considering we went specifically for the food. I don't know if we'd ever go back, but I never say never.",0,0,0

Side note: I think everyone should get to take a work trip to Scottsdale sometime. It seems like the best city in the country for a work trip! 

The Mission had two private tables set up on the outdoor patio. The outdoor fireplace was a big hit with our crowd. We started with wonderful chips and delicious, fresh guacamole. I truly could have sat there and eaten nothing but guacamole all night and been happy as a clam, but they just kept bringing out delicious food. We had a Taco Tuesday menu that consisted of several different tacos. The beef was my favorite, because I loved the cut of the meat (skirt) and the flavor of the seasonings. I also got to try the chicken and the pork shoulder tacos, but the steak stood out to me. 

The margaritas were plentiful and so delicious. They just kept coming, and we kept drinking them. I think some other people ordered specialty cocktails, but I'll always have the margarita when dining Mexican, especially at a such a renowned place as the Mission.

I managed to get us reservations (just barely) for the day after next, which was a Sunday night. If you don't have reservations, you can expect to wait quite a while for a table on the weekends. As we expected, it was packed. Every table was full, standing room only at the bar, etc. With our reservation though, we were seated right away, which was great. It's a decent size restaurant but it's not huge, so they really try to pack people in, meaning the tables are both smaller than you might like and much closer to each other than I prefer. Don't plan on having too intimate or private of a conversation here. 

We ordered two drinks to start, a Primarita and a Smokehouse; both completely delicious and at $13 each, fairly decently sized. And surprisingly, I didn't feel like I got more ice than alcohol. We also ordered the tableside guacamole, which is guacamole freshly prepared at your table to your specifications. However, in the already cramped conditions, it was a mildly awkward experience.  What made it even more awkward though was that we also ordered the Pork Shoulder Tacos, which the menu tells you is meant to be shared by two people. What the menu doesn't explicitly state is that what you get is a hunk of slow roasted pork shoulder brought to your teeny tiny table and you have to proceed to attempt to shred it yourself before you can actually prepare and eat said tacos. Doing that without knocking anything off of the table was a delicate task that I am fairly certain made my neighbors just as nervous as it made me as there were numerous close calls with the aforementioned tableside guacamole and our drinks, waters, salsa, etc. I am not a big fan of paying for food and having to prepare it myself before I can eat it.

I really like the atmosphere. It's dark so doesn't feel like a lunch place. The building has a lot of character. I got tacos which were delicious. We also got fresh guac which is made table side. The Mexican street corn came out as a side in a bowl. Very good.

I had my Farewell to Scottsdale, Arizona brunch on April 27th, and it was very disappointing.  After we were seated at 11 a.m.,  ordered drinks, and were given menus; the waitress advised us upon taking our order that their fryer was broken, and wouldn't be repaired anytime soon, or at least while we were dining.  Really problematic for our party, as we were looking forward to splitting their fabulous french fries.  There was a rather dismissive apology by the waitress, then she advised us that any of the entrees that would normally require a fryer could be prepared as grilled. I really couldn't think of what that was on the menu, but I ended up ordering a couple of ""safe"" appetizers to split, and left disappointed. We also ordered chips and guacamole, and the chips were either from another establishment or yesterday's as they were stale and uninviting.  Not what you would want to pair with $12 tableside guac.   It was even more entertaining to watch the very large touristy family next to us who wandered in with 7 kids under the age of 12.  There was nada on the menu for these little ones to eat except a quesadilla I guess.  After they ordered, their waiter came back to their table to let them know that their whiny kids would be ordering something else besides french fries and empanadas.  Sort of a metaphor for me and Scottsdale as a whole, glad to be back in Cali.",1,0,0

The Mission is located in Old Town Scottsdale amidst a flurry of Arizona souvenir shops,  pricey art galleries and historical museums.  This is a very touristy area.  Despite that, the Mission is anything but touristy.  It is tastefully decorated as the name would imply, and still goes a step beyond the cliche mission style with romantic window treatments and elegant chandalier lighting.

My friend and I came in for lunch and as we past  through the front patio, debated whether or not to dine al fresco.  That though evaporated as soon as we entered and eyed the bar.  It called out to us- as many bars do.  Unlike the rest of the place, the bar was empty so we hunkered down and recieved incredibly friendly and professional service.
After chatting up the bartender a little about the menu, we sipped our LA Vodka and sodas.  The vodka was tinged with pommegranite and was a little to sweet for me but it was vodka.
The tableside Guacamole was prepared with excellent results. Chunky, creamy and best of all zesty as it should be.  The Chips were warm and had 3 different salsas for dipping.  One was smokey, one green and one was just right!
Next up was a Peruvian clam stew, served with Taro root bread to sop up the savory juices.  The clams were fresh and the vegetables were very flavorful.  Delishious!
We decided to split the Pork Shoulder tacos.  Even though they appeared to be small, the flavor they packed was anything but.  It was the perfect amount  for us.  After a second drink and several glasses of water, we though t we were through- but no.
Our bartender friend surprised us with yet  another incredibly tasty dish- Pumpkin bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream and a little carmel sauce.  It was worth every fat calorie!
Everything about this place was excellent.  The service was impeccable.  The decor- interesting and romantic.  The food was truly inspiring and satisfying on every level.

Needed my phone flashlight to see the menu. Too dark is not for me. This does nothing for the ambience and gives me a feeling that there is something to hide. Perhaps $12 guacamole. That's one expensive avocado! 

I only ordered a salad and the ""tacos"". Mahi mahi that was mehi meh. The only peeps at my table who ordered entrees, were my two brothers. Meat eaters. They said their chorizo whateveritwas was good. Nothing on the plate as a side. I guess I just don't get it. Rent must be really high, and of course it is a ""cool"" location.

First up, the guac is a must must must! It's some of the best guac I've ever had. Seriously, I have dreams about it. I could bath in it. And I may, if they ever let me. 
Secondly, the drink menu changes fairly often and although a lot them are on the sweeter side (not my fav), they do have one that I've fallen in love with. Avocado margarita- they have a fancy name for it, but it's an avocado margarita. And it's one of the best drinks in town. It may sound weird, but I'm asking you to try it because if you have taste buds, you'll be happy you did.
Third on the list is the pork belly dish. Just eat it. That is all.
And lastly is the halibut. I've had this dish the last two times we've eaten here and I will have it again. The sauce they give you to pour over the dish...oh, the sauce. I would have poured it directly into my mouth if it wasn't frowned upon in Scottsdale.

The atmosphere of the restaurant demonstrates exactly why the name is ""The Mission"" Nestled in Old Town Scottsdale, next to an old Mission church.

The food was good, and we happened to go on sunday with half off wine but the problem was that the restaurant week offerings were a ""tasting menu"".  That is not how any other restaurant did it, that is not how the online menu depicted the meals, and small tapas sized dishes do not count as ""courses"".  For what we got it was hugely over-priced.  $29 for 2 appetizers and a miniature dessert. 50 other restaurants around town managed to make full meals fit into the $29 price point.   If you can't follow the theme of the event, don't participate.  

One of the reasons we chose The Mission was that a drink was included.  We assumed it was a glass of wine.  Well, it was actually about 2 ounces of a frozen margarita.  Take away the ice and you have about a teaspoon of tequila.  Thanks!  They should have used a thimble  as the icon for their drink on the Restaurant week list.      

I got duck carnitas for ""course 1"".  It was 3 quarter sized gorditas.  (I am not exaggerating the small size)  It was tasty but if I wanted hors d'oeurvres I would go to a cocktail party.  My gf got a Rock Shrimp Salad which was small but decent too.  

For appetizer 2 I got the Pork Shoulder and she got the Grouper.  I got maybe 2 oz of meat and she got maybe 3 ounces of fish.  Both were good, but not satisfying.  

For appetizer 3 (dessert edition) we got the churros with a chocolate shake which was 4 pinky sized churros with about 3 sips of a milkshake.  I think I could have stored the entire amount in the straw.  The gf got Pastel de Almendra which I don't remember how it was.  Wasn't great, wasn't bad.  

Of the 4 places we tried for Restaurant week, this place came in last.  Food wasn't as good as the others (Avalon, Wildfish, Papas Tapa Frita) and obviously the hobbit portions were not in the spirit of the event.  I'll stick to the other places that sacrificed a little profit margin in order to gain a new customer Vs this place trying to find a way to take as much money as possible while doling out the least amount of food pleasure.",0,0,0

Someone recommended we try The Mission for it's delicious food and amazing atmosphere, and we were certainly steered in the right direction. 

The Mission, aptly named to coincide with it's old Spanish mission style decor is a beautiful restaurant tucked away in Old Town Scottsdale. This ""hidden"" gem was packed with dinner-goers on a Tuesday night. The chandeliers speckled about the ceiling were enough to make me want to move in, but it was the table-side guacamole that sealed the deal. One guest in our group said that he had always hated guacamole and that this appetizer changed his life. Listen to him. Try it. You'll never want it anywhere else again. 

Often when you start on such a high note, there is bound to be disappointment later on. Not the case at the Mission. We ordered an array of appetizers to start, and the street corn was literally one of the best dishes I've ever had. Served on a stick...just like you would find at your favorite street vendor, the corn was the highlight of the dinner for me. 

Following our appetizers came halibut, skirt steak tacos, salads and more. Everyone RAVED about their entrees and the only letdown was that we didn't have enough room for the churros at the end of the night.

We all had the taco platters.. one chicken two steak, one pork... The pork  was definitely the best! Snack portions... So order extra appetizers, or plan on dessert.

The street side fired corn was amazing... Off the cob.  The cucumber jalapeño margarita was amazing -wish they had put a lot less ice in it however... Two sips and it was gone.

Definitely overpriced... Prices high, portions low... But I'd say the atmosphere makes that easier to handle.",0,0,1

5 stars for taste, ambiance, and one lady was really on top of water refills

- 1 star for price: the popular table side guacamole is $14?! Margaritas are $14-17?! I also saw on the menu a 22 oz ribeye for $85. Not even quality steakhouses charge that much. 

- 1 star for portion size: in regards to the prices above, the guacamole we were served barely went past the rim of the bowl. Not piled up like in the pictures. 3 tacos per order and each taco could be finished in 2 bites. 

-1 star for service: went on a Sunday night at 6:30 pm so understandably a bit busy. Took 5 min to get a refill of tortilla chips. After our main course was finished, waiter came by and recited items off the dessert menu. We asked to see the physical menu to see all the descriptions because we couldn't remember all that. Took 5 min to just give us the menu.

So upset after going to The Mission on our anniversary. We walk up to the entrance and encountered the tall, spiked hair, male employee who was blocking the patio entrance to the restaurant. He was advising everyone to try the House Brasserie and handing out their menu. It was very confusing, and he was only acknowledging certain people of the multiple people trying to get by him into the restaurant. We  finally made our way around the crowd after getting my feet stepped on and  spoke to the two female hostesses.  We were told it was a 45 minute wait. We were fine with this because we had not made a reservation. The bar was crowded so we went back out  front where there was a place to sit.  The bench where we were sitting was by the patio entrance. There we waited 45 minutes starring at a table on the patio that was available the entire time we waited. The hostesses texted us that our table was ready. As we were walking in, there was the spiked hair, male employee blocking the hostess station. He saw me walk up and did not acknowledge me and began to talk to a female who walked right in front of me. Eventually he turned to me and said "" you will have to wait a minute."" Then, he turned to me and said ""are you trying to get a table tonight""? At this point the female hostess are trying to look over him to talk to me but he would not budge his location. (Who is this guy? The bodyguard. He is not giving this restaurant a good first impression.)
I assume because the hostesses recognized me, they said, ""wait here because we are preparing your table."" We stood there and waited another 10 minutes.
Then, the hostess proceeded to walk us to the very open table we had been starring at for 45 minutes. This was the table they were ""preparing for us"" for the last 10 minutes? It had been prepared and empty for about 55 minutes!
When we told the hostess we did not want to sit at this table, she became visibly angry and hateful.
We were reseated at another open table on the patio. I wish we had just left and gone elsewhere.

I am not sure why the place is so popular. If you call, they are usually fully booked, but if you just walk in, there is a big chance you would be seated within 10 minutes. 
The décor is a mix of Latin and American steakhouse and doesn't have a unique identity in my opinion. It would definitely need a makeover to stay popular, given all the cool places that are popping up in the old town.
As for the food; I have been there three times already and the experience has always been average. Based on my last experience, I don't think I would go back.

On a whim it was chosen out of 9other restaurants on our list.  I was working in Mesa and my girlfriend somewhere in Phoenix and we thought Scottsdale would be our halfway point.  When we exchange restaurant ideas this place won just from food choices, presentation and of course the look.
It was everything. We started off with drinks at the bar -pineapple ginger mojito-

The waiter Andres was amazing, we ordered table side guacamole which I am only a fan of when made fresh, it was delish!

We got the cucumber jalapeño margarita and a glass of wine. The wine was good but the waitress recommended the margarita and it was definitely lacking something. It tasted watered down and I could barely detect any jalapeno flavor.

For food we got the flank steak tacos, the mahi mahi tacos, and the Merlot braised pork shoulder with a side of tortillas. The food tasted fine but I wasn't blown away and I was expecting something more considering the price tag. The best item out of the three was probably the mahi mahi tacos because they were fairly large hunks of mahi mahi and were lightly fried. Although this may be because my taste buds had been spoiled from going to a certain incredible Mexican restaurant in Sedona a few days prior so The Mission couldn't compete in comparison. 
For dessert we ordered the pumpkin bread pudding which was delicious and definitely the best part of the meal.

The presentation of all the dishes was nice and the tortillas came out on a large warm block which kept the others warm which was nice.

The interior of the restaurant was quite dark and cave-esque but it was a cool setting and the back patio looked nice but there was a private party there so we couldn't check it out. The service was fine, our waitress kept recommending dishes which was nice but it got to the point where it seemed like she was just recommending things to get us to order more.

My friend and I are both from out of town and we had a wonderful evening there, served by a very lovely and attentive female server. We convinced the other girls from our business meeting (many also from out of town) to go, and we were served by Jeff, who, from the get-go, treated us completely differently from Angelene the night before (I'm SO sorry for this review, Angelene). He was condescending (kept speaking over us), and he even rolled his eyes when one of our girls complained that her guacamole was way too spicy and asked for a re-do. (Sorry, but when something is too spicy, people can't just swallow it down even if they want to.) 

The other girls were already making comments that he was coming across rude, but I didn't feel it until the end of the night when he asked us how we were all doing. I said, ""I think we're ready for the check,"" and he replied dismissively, ""I'm asking everybody."" I'm sorry, Jeff, but I didn't realize that I wasn't part of the ""everybody."" There was then an awful miscommunication over a guacamole charge because we were all on separate bills. I get it; it's confusing and really annoying to gather separate bills. I get it; it's not ideal and it's extra work. But what I didn't get was the combative attitude and the condescending tone from both Jeff and the manager (who kept hovering over our table in the most uncomfortable manner at the beginning of our meal) who kept demanding to know ""then where's the fourth guacamole supposed to go?"" Every time we tried to explain, we got cut off (by both of them) with ""I get it"" when they clearly didn't. There wasn't a single apology for the mix up, and our gal was so over it that she had to ask three times to just give her the check to pay for it. Another one of our ladies even had to jump in a fourth time to ask for it just to end the debacle.

What blew the lid off me was that Jeff overheard (or one of his coworkers did) one of our girls say ""no tip!"" and he came out and handed us a tirade, yelling at us, ""Just to let you know, it's really not cool to leave no tip over a guacamole and that it's not fair to not tip people who work their asses off for you."" Guess what? We know. He was serving a table of people who work in service --many of whom were business owners-- and we live off of tips and the generosity of our clients, as well. 

Note to Jeff: I was actually going to leave you a tip so that you had something to tip your busser, your bartender, and the lovely gentleman who made the tableside guacamole with. But when you decided to go off on our ENTIRE table based off of your eavesdropping of what ONE person said, I was done, and I, too, for the first time in seventeen years, didn't leave a tip either. (Sept of '99 was the last time I didn't tip.) The server was livid--I get it, but we could feel the passive aggressive condescension from the beginning, and hopefully that sheds light on our building frustration throughout the night. 

Jeff asked a good question: All this for $6? Maybe The Mission, its manager, and its servers should ask themselves the same question--was it worth quibbling over $6 when you probably made $400+ at a table of 8? I've never experienced service like this. I'm sorry if your server was having a bad day, but we all saw him roll his eyes at us at the beginning of the night. We all heard every time he talked over us. And you don't dismiss a customer with ""I'm asking every one"" when she asks for the check. And when you get the bill wrong, even if it's not (you think) your fault, just say you're sorry and try to understand the situation instead of getting accusatory. We didn't even get an apology when we brought up the incorrect billing from any of the 3 people who interacted with us over it. Like I said, just a lot of getting cut off with ""I get it, but..."" 

Honestly, we were all set to have a good time, but I think that he decided ahead of time that we were going to be annoying and going to cause trouble, and by acting from that set of expectations, he actually created the situation. I wish he gave us a chance, because we certainly gave him many throughout the night. And if he's still hurt about not getting a tip from me (which I hope I don't have to do ever again), it came in the form of my silence from not ripping you a new one after you ripped into us over what ONE person said.

The food is great, and the cocktails, though pricy, were tasty. I had an amazing experience being served by female servers for a small party. With parents in the restaurant industry, friends and clients in the restaurant industry, and myself working in service, I am the furthest thing from the most demanding client, but any customer can seem demanding when they won't meet you halfway and listen. We told them exactly how to split the bill, but it's hard to be clear when you get cut off with ""I get it, but..."" every time you try.",1,0,0

Maybe our problem was that we were dining after 10pm on a weekend, and they weren't as mindful as they should have been.  But for the prices they charge, there is no excuse for the lack of execution.

They were cut small and very good.  The guac was in a tiny bowl that was made table side.  It was fresh but not worth 12 bucks.  The fish tacos were about the size of two bites.  Tasty but incredibly small.  The same with the pork tacos.  They gave us ten tortillas about the size of a sand dollar, a tiny amount of toppings, and a few mounds of pork.  They tasted excellent but again they were almost child fun size versions.  

I also tried the aguacate margarita which was silky smooth and delicious but in a small glass filled with ice.  Nothing seemed worth the price for me.

The Mission was both!
We liked the cocktail choices, but asked if the bartender would make slight changes (vodka instead of tequila) and they were happy to oblige , and were delicious. Had a pineapple\/mint with ginger combo...tasty with Vodka. 

We shared the table made guacamole which was good, not spectacular like some reviews here ...and we shared the pulled pork tacos for two. Yes the homemade tortillas are small (about 2 1\/2 in. diameter) but there was plenty of the pork, and very delicious. Came with sides of roasted tomato salsa, a honey bar b que sause, onions and cilantro...the tortillas are kept warm on a warm block of salted rock..it was lit from underneath somehow. 
Creative and pretty presentation. 
Plenty of food for two women who didn't want to be stuffed.

I found out about the event on facebook.  As my boyfriend Ben is frollicking in New Orleans for Mardi Gras I have taken full advantage to keep myself busy and get of the house.  The event started at 2 p.m. until sunset as advertised with 1\/2 off Mimosas, Bloody Marys and Sangria.  $16 per person all you can eat with housemade corn torillas, chips and roasted salsas.   

I ended up bumping into recently James Beard nominated Chef Kevin Binkley of Binkleys restaurat and his wife.  Chef Matt took us outside to show us ""the guest of honor"" the 50 lb pig that had been roasted since 6 a.m. that morning.  The last time I had roasted pig was at an authentic luau in Kaui in 1995.  

The pig roast was absolutey what I expected which was tender and flavorful.  Matt suggested to us that the pig was ""money"" and to eat it simply with the tortillas and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro.  No salsa necessary.  As always I take the chef's advice and do what I am told.  He was right.  Perfect.  It was a gorgeous afternoon on the patio and guests were seated inside as well.  Everyone was enjoying themselves.  I had one of the Mimosas made with fresh orange juice and Cava a Spanish sparkling wine.  So refreshing.  Also, had one of their best margaritas made with Partida Tequila and Agave nectar.  I especially enjoy Partida.  I met the owners daughter in Scottsdale to promote their new venture in making tequilas at an Alliance Beverage tasting a few years ago.  The family had been growing Agave for 100 years and thought it was time to start making tequilas.  Anyway, the margarita was made with fresh lime juice which I love, love, love.  Delicious.

I rarely get out to see how the rest of the world lives on Sunday afternoons because I am sleeping in after a busy weekend at Roka Akor, the restaurant I work for since it has opened.  I am glad I got my day started and enjoyed The Mission's first Pig Out.  I am sure more Pig Outs will follow.",3,2,2

Some of my team members are visiting this week so naturally we came here for din! I had the Paloma for my first cocktail and it was SO tasty! I love that they put St. Germain in it! It came in a fancy frosted martini glass with a salted rim and was refreshing and delish. 

To start - YOU MUST get the tableside guac because it is probably some of the best guac that i've ever had in my life. I also LOVE their chips - they're thin, crispy, and not oily at all. Paired with their homemade salsa, i'm a REAL happy camper. We also split the grilled little gem salad and this was pretty disappointing. There were no grill marks or char on it whatsoever but the flavors were good! It just wasn't what the menu advertised it to be. 

For my entree, I got the Flat Iron Steak medium rare and added the poblano grits to it instead of the small cheesy rolls that it comes with and it was TO DIE FOR. The meat was cooked perfectly. I loved the tomatillos on it, and overall, it was just really flavorful. In my opinion they should serve it over grits all of the time! I enjoyed it with a glass of house cabernet and they paired perfectly together. 

All in all, we had a great experience and I still stand firm behind my recommendation to colleagues and friends! :)

The dining area was pretty dark, but I later realized it was because we were outside and our eyes needed time to adjust.  I loved the black chandeliers everywhere.  Very lively atmosphere.

I started off with the Watermelon Basil mojito.  Very refreshing!  The table next to us had ordered the tableside guacamole so although we had chips, salsa and guacamole for a snack earlier in the day, we had to get some.   We ordered medium spice and it had a good kick to it.  They do make it in front of you and for 2 people, it was a whole lot of guacamole!  

For appetizers, we ordered the Duck Confit Empanadas, which ended up sounding better than it tasted.  It was not the pie crust dough like most empanadas.  Instead, it was like crispy wontons.  The crust was overcooked and it came with a sweet sauce so I felt like I was eating Chinese food instead of Latin American.  That was a disappointment!

By then, we were pretty full so although we ordered two types of tacos, we ended up canceling one.  We just had the Mahi Mahi tacos which were Tecata battered with a nice sauce.  It came with 3 street size tacos.  It was delicious.  The table next to us ordered the Pork Shoulder tacos which serves for 2.  That looked good as well as it came with a whole chunk of braised pork.  If we were hungry, we would have ordered that.

From the moment I walked in, I knew I was probably in the wrong spot.  I was visiting from out of town, and just wanted some good Mexican food.  I'm a foodie, I don't need a lot of ambiance.  In fact, give me a wood floor, a wobbly table and someone that just knows how to cook great, and I'm set.  This place was very nice, very popular, but I don't view Mexican to be like this.  Not racist, but again, I wanted simple, great, authentic food, cooked the way one would cook in their own kitchen.

I had the Mahi Mahi tacos.... and I got three tacos, each looked to be maybe 3"" in diameter, a bit larger than a silver dollar.  That's it.  No rice, no beans, three SMALL tacos for about $15.  I also had the made tableside guac... and while it was EXCELLENT, it was also $14!  I'll say this, it was delicious and the guy making it was really nice, great guy!!

The service... if it wasn't for the guy making my guac, who also kept my water coming, I would have said it was terrible service.  My waitress just seemed overworked, and as a result, the service was not good!  Really disappointed there, especially when I paid so much for so little.  

Overall, TERRIBLE value for the money, one of the worst overall experiences I've had in a while.  If it wasn't for the guac and the guy making it, this would have had ONE start from me!",4,0,0

It was topped with pumpkin seeds which was a first for me.  My sister ordered Chorizo Porchetta which was pork shoulder with fresh kitchen made chorizo stuffed in the middle and I ordered the Chilean Salmon.  The drinks were amazing.

I had no idea where to go so I followed him slowly. The sun finally went down. I had no idea where he was going but he said that he knew because his Google map told him so. I passed by the Mission, it looked busy and crowded, and there was no seating so we put our names down. It was not what he had intended, but he said, it looked really good. I don't know much about anything except for I was being led, a role I very rarely played, but there was a sense of freedom of letting go of your control, I often controlled where what when how to eat but not with him. 

We pivoted back to this same spot, he could not find the original restaurant he intended to go. His Google map led him stray. There was still a 45 minute wait. But the bar area was open seating, just then, it opened up. Two seats. Both of us are left handed, bar seating has been his favorite, because he said that then we could talk, he did not have to feel sitting too far from me. When I eat I did not like to talk. I take my food seriously and talking just seemed to be in conflict with the main purpose of eating. Still, we did not want to wait as we were hungry.

The bartender offered us a menu for food and a menu for drinks. He ordered wine and I scanned the menu. Not knowing what to order I told him to decide. He sought advice from the bartender and he gave several suggestions. We settled on two different types of fancy street tacos and duck empanadas. Two drinks, three things, perfect balance and extremely good portioned. He liked, no, loved ducks. We ate either sushi or duck, I've known this man for nearly 20 years, and still he had not changed.

The restaurant is wildly popular among locals. The festive atmosphere reminded me that famous spot in Malaga spain, right in the downtown square, where all the locals go and late into the evening  they dined and laughed and caught up their lives. As if to prove me right, the next day, while riding in Uber, the driver said, ""you went to the Mission? That's right across from Livery Stables. A good spot. A local favorite."" 

When he and I traveled together, my experience felt surreal, like he was just a figment of my imagination, and I was only talking to his shadow, visiting restaurants he would have liked to dine in, and ordering dishes he would have liked to order. Perhaps all along he was never there, and I was only the lone traveler, pretending he was with me, eating with me, loving me, until the end of the time.",7,4,4

And then for our main entrees we each shared:
Mahi Mahi tacos: one of the best mahi mahi tacos I've ever had!
Crispy Rock Shrimp tacos: average but still good
Tecate Skirt Steak tacos:  different from what we expected but was delicious!

Service was friendly and polite.

The place was crowded (good) and atmosphere was great.  The right noise\/activity level though quite a bit of the clientele were older (60+) semi-snobby acting loud-talkers.  I imagine it's a popular spot for tourists as well (though not during that VERY slow week in town).  The small bar area was much better and offered us the opportunity to wince as we watched an incredibly beautiful woman try to get away from what was clearly an online-dating nightmare...very entertaining and a study in body language for sure! Aaaayway...

As the hostess started to lead us into the dining room, we noticed that all of the 4-tops were quite small.  That-is, small for 4 guys 6'2"" - 6'5"" and 210 - 250 lbs.  We looked one another and made the obvious point...we would be packed next to each other.  We instead opted for the long high-top bar table and it was perfect for us.

Server (Meghan?) was excellent.  Cute little gal who did a great job explaining things and checking-in regularly.  Of course, we're hard to miss there in the center of the bar area.

Food - Quality was excellent.  Nicely presented but waaaaay to much emphasis on making it feel ""haute-ish"".  Latin dishes done very well but be prepared for excessively small portions.  They must run a fantastic food cost here.  Porchetta with house-made Chorizo (no more than 4 ounces) and a puny bowl\/ramekin of pureed white beans and crema of some sort (maybe 1\/2 cup)...$28.00!  Of course, nicely decorated plate and again, excellent quality and flavor profile.  But come-on, it's Porchetta and Chorizo for cryin out loud.   Also ordered their side of house-made tortillas - Four or five 3"" round little tortillas served on a big heated salt rock...$8!  Now THAT was funny...or not.

So - Good food, done well.  BUT I won't go back based only on the silly portion sizes for the money and trust me, I almost never gripe about the price as long as the quality is there.  

Would definitely go back for drinks or a $7 Stella (yeah, I know) and maybe find that amazingly beautiful woman trapped by her stalker-date! (alas...sigh).",1,2,1

I had hear a lot of great things about The Mission, so a friend and I finally decided to give it a try.  It was a Friday night, the place was packed, we decided to sit at the bar, have a drink and order some appetizers.  While sitting there another single woman at the bar started talking to us along with 2 couples that were waiting to be seated for dinner.  So the group of newly found friends (7 total), all started talking, laughing and enjoying ourselves.  
Just a side note, there was a TV on in the bar, with a football game, music (current upbeat) being piped in through the bar and restaurant, the crowd was about at an average decimal level for a Friday evening, packed place with a TV and music in the background.
After laughing at one of the many topics of conversation that our new friends brought to the table, the bartender came over to our group and gave us a ""shhhh"" using his hands in a ""lower the volume"" motion.   I asked ""did someone complain about us being to loud"" (I was shocked)  he motioned over to his manager, who about a half hour earlier came over to welcome us and we raved to him about the food and atmosphere.  
Another side note, I am a 49 year old woman, raised well, from Scottsdale, have been in the service industry and know how to ""behave"" in an establishment.
I was so insulted, as were our other new friends, we all asked for our bills and cashed out, to the bartenders surprise.
As I was leaving, I asked to see the Manger, Tom is his name.  He came over, I asked if any of the patrons had complained about the volume of our conversation, he said ""no but several were looking your way as you were all laughing""......   REALLY?!!!!!
Not only did I explain that he made a very poor choice in having the bartender do his dirty work and ask us to lower our voices, but the fact that no one complained, and that the restaurant was loud and as I looked around the majority of the patrons were laughing and having a good time, gave me cause to believe that he had no right to embarrass us as he did.  
Tom never apologized, got very defensive and rude to both myself and my friend.  I will admit that there may have been 30 seconds to 1 minute when 7 people were laughing and clapping hands at the topic of conversation, but in no way were we causing a scene or making spectacle of ourselves.
I hope Tom and the owner of The Mission read this review and remember the old saying ""a happy patron will tell 3 people, an unhappy patron will tell dozens""......

crispy pork
pork belly

main course:
duck confit

dessert:
pumpkin bread pudding with fresh pomegrenate toppings

yea...I know...we were total pigs..but hey..the food was so good!! They brought out all the ingredients and customized the table-top guacamole for us according to how spicy we wanted it and what we wanted in there. The crispy pork\/pork belly were also bite sizes (though still in good portions!)...and were delicious treats to us! I love the food there so much even though after eating all those dishes...I felt like I could never really have any Latin American\/Mexican food for the next few months! The biggest let down though was the pumpkin bread pudding. It really didn't taste like bread pudding at all. It tasted more like pumpkin bread soaked in some sort of syrup and just topped with fresh pomegrenate seeds.  If I ever get to go there again, I would just skip desserts and only go for appetizers\/main coruses there. Total damage to our wallet (e.g. cost without tip) was around $130, including soda\/2 cocktails.

By the time we left (8:30pm), the bar\/restaurant were both completely packed! I saw a couple waiting for a table just anywhere (bar\/restaurant) and I felt like they must have been waiting at least 1+ hour! yikes!!

As our time frame was only for an hour we ordered table side guacamole and everyone ordered the carnitas tacos with pineapple salsa. Everyone I was with had been back to back in meetings and we were eating at 1:30 so everyone pretty much was starved and not really concerned about quality as much as getting in and out of the restaurant as fast as we could.

I watched my 3 business partners inhale their tacos without taking a breath. Me on the other hand decided to really check them out. Because I was at a business lunch I didn't have time to whip out my camera to take a photo for Yelp but I gotta tell you that my carnitas were literally just MEH.

The meat was not tender with no particular flavor and all I could taste was the small chunks of onion and pineapple that was sprinkled around the meat. While the tacos were street tacos they should really be labeled as itsy bitsy tiny, winy tacos. You could literally scoop them up and take two big bites and you'd be finished.

As far as service the Guacamole guy was awesome and friendly but our waitress was slow as she was serving diners both inside and outside on the patio.

I had a superb white Sangria and we ordered the tableside guac and housemade chips to split. It was a generous helping and both were astoundingly delicious. I will say that while the guacamole is stellar here, it does not (IMO) unseat the undisputed Guac champion- Barrio Queen (which is right around the block). 

The chips were better here though.

Main course- I ordered the Florida Grouper with Paella reduction, banana crab croquette, brussels sprouts, crispy quinoa & pickled gueros. This fish was SO BOMB. It was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Who knew Grouper was so good? The brussel sprouts (which is not my fave vegetable by any means), crispy quinoa, AND the crab cake were also uber yum-tastic!

My date had the Alaskan Cod which came with Purple & romanesco cauliflower, toasted farro, leek & garlic mote & smoked pasilla sabyon- he raved about how tasty it was.

For dessert we ordered the fried bananas which came with dulce de leche ice cream (or gelato?) and this outstanding peanut butter moussey-stuff on the side. So freakin' yummy OMG.

Our server took really good care of us, very knowledgeable of the menu with some great recommendations.  Ambient was filled with energy flowing, fun, laid back with a modern southwestern, chic feel.

Commenced with some refreshing, ""healthy"" cocktail - Bloody Orange Margarita, made fresh using real fruit with no sugar.  So good I ordered another.  Most of the drinks looked really good.

For the apps or botanas (as they call it), we had Duck Carnitas Empanadas, Pork Belly Pibil,and Almejas Al Vapor.  We ordered 2 of each as we wanted to share among the group.  I would have to say I enjoyed every single one of them.  NOW, the foie gras that came with the Empanadas, I thought was a little overdone so therefore dry.  Foie gras usually is softer and juicier with balanced flavor.

For the main entree, we had this tender Pork Shoulder that came with Tortilla complemented with a nice sweet, tangy sauce to drizzle over. Oh wow, just amazing.  The meat was soo tender that you just peeled it right off. 

Desert - Pumpkin Bread Pudding, pretty good.  A little too sweet, but good.

I would definitely return for some more deliciousness!",2,1,1

The crispy rock shrimp tacos were excellently seasoned and perfectly portioned. I also had an appetizer of mole chicken, which was good, but somewhat dry and was not warm when it arrived to my table. I had the Guatamelan Chocolate Pastilla for dessert, which was absolutely delicious; my only recommendation would be that they serve it in a bowl or on a plate with a raised edge.

Last time we were there, we went for my mother's birthday. She is a pretty hot 60+ lady, but the waitress was sort of busting out of her bra (which was busting out of her shirt) A little too much for my taste, keep it classy- we're not in Vegas. AND you're a restaurant connected to a church. It sort of ruins the quasi romantic atmosphere. I also think the seating is a bit cramped for dinner seating, this isn't Pei Wei folks.

Yes!). As we're vegetarians, and ballpark food is usually pretty sparse for folks who don't eat hot dogs and cheese steaks, we were looking for a place to grab some lunch before the game, and the menu here drew us right in.

We chose to sit on the well-shaded patio, as the interior of the restaurant is rather dark. The patio is really pleasant...well-shaded, and with plenty of cover to prevent...er...birdy accidents (I normally avoid dining al fresco, having lost many a tasty meal to a sparrow's incontinence, but this patio was sheltered enough that it seemed -- and, thankfully, was -- safe!).

Neither of us wanted anything heavy (we were still a bit full from a wonderful pizza at Papago Brewing the night before, and anticipating a big dinner at Café Lalibela in Tempe that evening). I ordered the Grilled Romaine Salad and an order of Grilled Street Corn, and my husband had the Roasted Organic Butternut Squash Tacos. We regretfully declined the tableside quacamole, even though we're major guac fans, as we knew we'd never find room for it (we did see it being made, though, and it looked amazing).

We both enjoyed our food, but we also agreed that my meal was the real star. If you've never tried (or thought about) grilling lettuce, you're really missing something! Grilling brings out the sweetness in this often rather bland vegetable, and adds a nice smokiness that was, in this salad, perfectly complemented by the chipotle vinaigrette. Everything was in perfect balance, with a slight saltiness added by the cotija cheese, a kiss of heat from the chipotles, and textural contrasts provided by the black beans and the thin tortilla strips. It was generously sized too...perfect for a light lunch.

The corn was, in a word, amazing. My serving consisted of nearly an entire ear of corn, served as two skewers, each bathed in a luscious chili-laced butter sauce and lightly coated with more cotija cheese. Yum!

My husband's tacos were very good as well. They were served as three mini-tacos, each on a small, handmade tortilla. The proportion of filling to tortilla made them something you'd want to eat with a fork (like a small, not-fried, tostada) rather than try to pick up. The filling was well-seasoned and had a very good flavor.

I also had one of their house margaritas (on the rocks), and it was very well-made. You knew you were drinking tequila and not some cheap-o candy drink. Good flavor, with just the right amount of tartness.

Very glad we stopped here! We'll be repeat customers!",0,0,0

Ok, so I've only been there twice. But even after only two dining experiences at a restaurant where EVERY SINGLE THING you order is delicious - not just ok, not just passable, but really, really tasty - it leads you to believe that it's a knock-out of a restaurant...like a guy that's hot AND has a personality. Don't think they exist? Yeah, well... neither did I. But they do! Ok, well, in restaurant world, that is...I make no promises about the real world.

Seriously, I don't think I can complain about anything, so let's just get on to the food. I started with a blended Lemon Margarita that was yum-tastic...the first time I tried the Mango (the flavors change daily), and it was better, but I'm not one to poo-poo any blended Margarita that comes my way, and The Mission's are particularly good. Anyway, we ordered the tableside guac to munch on before our meals arrived, and it was DELISH. Delish. Granted, it's only 1 avacado, but it didn't feel like too little guac, and we had 4 people. Anyway, they do this thing where they drizzle extra virgin olive oil over it at the end, and as WEIRD as that sounds, it makes it REALLY GOOD. I have no idea why. But it does.

For our entrees, we each ordered some version of the tacos, either chicken or skirt steak. I LOVED the skirt steak tacos...they were so good. They come tecate marinated with green chili salsa, avocado, lime, cilantro and cotija, and all of the flavors just work together magnificently...I think each one took me no more than 2 bites to eat. My friend that ordered the chicken tacos said they were fabulous, too, and after he tried the steak tacos, he said they were actually BETTER...I find that hard to believe, but I'll have to try them next time and find out! 

In addition to the tacos, we got the Mission Fries, which is a massive basket of sweet potato and regular french fries with different dipping sauces. We also (inexplicably, I know...SO MUCH FOOD...) got the Grilled Sweet Corn, which literally had melted butter drizzled across is. Now, I'm from the Cornhusker state, and BELIEVE you me, I have had my fair share of sweet corn. So when I say that this was really some mad good sweet corn, you know I'm not just yanking your chain. Order this. It comes with only 2 ears, though, so be sure to order accordingly.

Also, order the churros. We didn't get them this time around, but the first time we did order them, and they're REAL good...maybe not as good as the ones at Barrio Cafe, but still delightful. I mean, they're chocolate and served with a milkshake. Seriously. 

My coworkers were very impressed with my choice of restaurant, so not only did The Mission yield a superb meal, but it has also convinced my coworkers to bestow upon me all restaurant-choosing rights from now until the end of time...and THAT is fantastic!",5,4,6

It typically comes on the cob, but we made a special request to have it shaved.

We were there early, too -- 530. Place was empty inside, and outside just a handful of tables. My wife is constantly jabbing me about worrying too much about long waits, so I got more razzing this time. But that would soon change.

We started with the guacamole. It is pricey, but very good. I recommend going with the spicy, but tell them to lay off the salt and the garlic.

For cocktails, my wife got the Blood Orange, i got the Cucumber Jalapeno on the recommendation of our server Canton (sp?). I'm a sucker for cucumber margaritas, and this one did not disappoint. I wanted a pitcher! My wife was not as thrilled with her Blood Orange, but she loves Grand Marnier in her margs. For her second, she went with the house marg and had them add Grand Marnier -- Bingo!

Dinner was outstanding. Simply delicious!

My wife got the braised short ribs. Very good, well-balanced and plenty to take home. We got a side of the street corn and it was also very good, although my one complaint for the night was that the corn was literally swimming in the aioli. I'd recommend a lighter touch on that. I'd also recommend a little more of a toast to the corn. But, seriously, it was STILL really, really good.

I got the Flat Iron Steak, and it was server medium rare. Frickin' delicious! What a great beef taste, and not too chewy -- although, like all flat irons, be sure you are ready for a bit of a fight when you eat this cut of meat. It's not a tenderloin cut. But what a great meat taste. The sauce on top was also delicious.

We took a pass on dessert, although the fried bananas looked very good. I also have to mention that the chips and salsa were a bit disappointing. The chips were generic thin, thin chips and the sauce was a chipotle salsa. Would have loved some house made chips and a fresh pico de gallo.

But those are quibbles. This place ROCKS! And for a couple of people who live almost within walking distance of one of the hottest Mexican places in the Chicago Suburbs, Bien Trucha in Geneva, we have to say this place is a CLOSE second to BT.

I was not impressed by their menu, or by my dinner there that evening.  I eat out every day, but never returned.  Fast forward to today.  I was headed somewhere else, but they were closed for the Labor day holiday.  There were cars parked in front of The Mission (as there generally are) so I decided that perhaps I had been hasty in my original opinion.

Perhaps it was because I arrived after 3:00 when they only serve a limited menu, but I tried the brisket sandwich.  The experience didn't start off bad...it was kind of flavorful and interesting, until I realized that what I was chewing on was mostly fat.  The $12 sandwich was mostly not brisket (coleslaw and such), and the brisket that it contained was very fatty meat.  The second half of the sandwich was so greasy that I passed on the saturated bread and picked through the contents...coleslaw and fat.

We came here during the week and it was extremely busy. The wait for a table was about 45 minutes. We found a table in the bar area so ended up sitting there. Everything that we ordered I felt like it was a bit salty. We started off with the tableside guacamole. The good thing about this is it is extremely fresh, they come to your table and make it right in front of you! It was good but a bit salty. I ordered the Tecate Skirt Steak. The steak was very tender but also a bit salty. & you get 3 mini tacos. They're really little. My friend is a vegetarian so she ordered the Grilled Portobello Mushroom which she didn't enjoy because it was also salty. The waitress asked how everything was and recommended the Corn Gorditas instead, took her plate and brought her the new dish. =)

There is a round table with claw legs under a chandelier that came from Brians mom's house and I would guess once stood at the base of double spiral staircase in the foyer of a large plantation-like home.

We ordered the pulled pork tacos for two dinner (32.00).  It took quite a while and when it came the tortillas were very small and extremely doughy.  The pork was fatty and just not very good.  

On top of everything else, it is very dark so it's hard to see what you are eating.  I used my iPhone flashlight app so we could read the menus.  

Really wanted to like the place but the quality was not there.  Definitely would never go back.  One start is for service and the other is for the drinks.  That's it.",0,0,0

Let me start off by saying that I am not trying to trash this restaurant but I was not impressed by my experience that I had there the at all. I decided to check it out because of what the reviews said on yelp and ended up being a bit of a let down and that kind of makes me wonder if some of the Yelp reviews were done by family, employees or friends. I love to eat out and try to do so as often as I can (or cash flow allows), so me and girlfriend tried 2 apps with 2 main dishes trying to get a feel for the food and enjoy a good dinner. First, when we walk in the place it was very empty and it still took the hostess a bit long to seat us, why? I don't know. Second, we have a seat take a look at the menu and the server greets us (by the way nice server but kind of spacey) he takes are drink orders and recommends a few dishes. After a while we get our drinks but not the bottle of water that I wanted and paid for (it never got there) and the cocktails were imaginative but bland. To spare going into details the food was not bad, but just okay. After all the hype I was expecting more but honestly if I wanted great modern Mexican\/Latin food I would definitely go somewhere else like - Mucho Gusto or Barrio Cafe ECT.... I think that what made me realize that I would not come back here is, when I felt the snotty and stuck up feel of this place when I responded to one of the employees about what I thought about my meal. I wasn't rude but said it was just okay but they made me feel like I was wrong for not loving it. The staff is a bit arrogant or at least similar to how this town seems to be and the prices reflect that... I am by no means cheap but $12+ drinks?, portions that don't match the prices(way over priced for what it is) call me what you like but I'll stick to great food and some what reasonable prices somewhere else. If the food were amazing the price wouldn't even be an issue i.e. Mastro's City Hall. Like I said earlier seems kind of odd that some people have given this place 5 stars when it's avrage at best. In a city were there are places that deserve high praise(4-5 stars) this is not one of them. The Mission honestly gets 2.5 to 3 stars for food, 3 for the setting (kinda cool but trying to be too trendy) but lost it when it came to the service, drinks and overall lackluster food, portions\/price. I love Matt's other place Zinc Bistro but this just makes me wonder about chefs crossing over to cuisines that they enjoy eating but perhaps don't understand. I might give it another try sometime to see if it improves but I don't think I'll be back... So sad so sad, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next big thing......

I got hungry so I checked the best place for lunch in the area on Yelp and found The Mission, was highly rated. It was across the street from where I was standing so we headed that way.

When we arrived we were able to get a table in the outside courtyard in the front of the restaurant. We informed the waiter we had very little time for lunch. The three of us ordered margaritas with salt at $8 each. They charged an extra $2 for one with Cointreu. We ordered two Almejas Al Vapor stews for $14 each and one shaved Kale salad for only $10. The shaved kale salad consisted of aji amarillo vinaigrette, baby heirlooms, blood orange, goat cheese & marcona almonds. My friend loves kale. The Almejas Al Vapor is a peruvian clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo & roasted corn. I especially enjoyed the unusual appearance and spice of the stew. See my pic. The stew made me want to go to Peru for some more. I have never been to Peru. 

The waiter was very expeditious in serving us.

My total bill for the three of us for lunch was a very reasonable $69 without gratuities and we were all happy with our meals, margaritas and service.",38,28,33

The food was well prepared and nicely presented.  It could have been 4-stars, but the tacos were sadly small for the price.

Last week's experience was a real let down.  I took my family for a Latin dining experience and was sadly disappointed.  Being an arepa lover, I was excited to partake in the experience with my loved ones.  When we arrived, we were told that arepas were no longer part of the menu, although they were still on the menu :-(  They are now serving the sandwiches that were served on arepas, on the torta bread.  The server was apologetic, but frankly, after driving 40 miles to get this specific menu item and checking the on-line menu before making the trip, I was not happy.

The pabellon filling was very good, but again, a let down without the arepa.  To add insult to injury, when the sandwiches were served, they did not bring Mission fries on the plate, because according to the bus boy, the menu changed when the sandwich was no longer served on the arepa, and it no longer was served with the fries.  The server quickly righted this issue and offered us fries on the house.

There are some high points to the experience: the setting is very pretty and the service is attentive.  The chorizo and papas appetizer is delicious and something worth ordering when you go.",0,0,0

The bartender was great--knowledgeable and able. The chips and salsa were the best we've had in Scottsdale--house made thin sliced chips got and salty and smoky salsa. The guacamole was fine. Good texture--not too chunky--but could have used some flavor. Dipping it in the salsa made it perfect!

Our waitress was Amazing! I wish I could remember her name so I could give her a shout out. She knew the menu completely and was very informative on how things were prepared and provided great suggestions on what to order which were helpful since it was hard to read the menus in the dimly lit restaurant. Our table was constantly being checked on by other employees checking on drinks and chip refills. 

I ordered a traditional mojito and my mom got the Cadillac blood orange margarita. Both were delicious and you can definitely taste the fresh ingredients used. We ordered the table side guacamole and pork shoulder tacos which were incredible and was perfect for sharing. For our main courses we ordered the green chili duck confit which was packed with various flavors and textures. The mole kinda overpowered the dish with a strong nutmeg taste but was still a great dish. My husband ordered the chorizo porchetta with white bean purée and it was fork tender and melted in your mouth, the purée was unbelievable. My mom and stepdad ordered the driver scallops and you could smell their plates from across the room. Regardless of the strong odor they said it was a very delicious plate. Our server kindly packed up our leftovers and suggested dessert options. 

Overall it was a great dinner. The restaurant was packed by the time we left and the close tables made it difficult to squeeze out of without giving the table next to you a face full of butt. 

We will definitely be back for another visit and look forward to trying different options on the menu. Thank You for providing a delicious Mexican meal that isn't just slathered in sauce and melted cheese!",2,0,0

The ambiance is really laid back and mellow but in a cool, retro hip way. We sat at the bar for lunch and everything was great. I had the skirt steak tacos which were absolutely delicious - I was so full but I wanted more! We also got the basket of french fries...a combination of traditional fries and sweet potato fries.

That said: !!!!!!!!! and to follow up: yummmm. 

I stopped by for lunch and sat on the front patio which was perfect since the the sun was diffused, there was a breeze and I could eyeball other people's meals while I waited. My server was Sam who is probably the most gregarious server I've had in a long time. That was great because I was dining alone and he made me feel like I was not a loser. I ordered the Corn Gorditas ($9) and the Taro Fries ($7) and was pleased with both. My only regret was using the fries' two dipping sauces because it numbed my pallate a little in terms of appreciating the nuances of the gorditas, which were a little small for a $9 appetizer but all the same, very complete in their blend of flavors and textures. 

Then I took my meal to the next level by ordering dessert. I'm not sure ""orgasm in my mouth"" is a family-friendly term but nonetheless it applies to the pumpkin bread pudding ($6) I ordered. As if pumpkin needed any help, The Mission soaks it in a caramel sauce and sprinkles it with pepitas and pomegranate seeds after adding a heaping scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. orgasm.in.my.mouth. I only wished there were a few more pomegranate seeds tossed on there because their tart juice really contrasted beautifully. I tried not to moan out loud as I ate it. 

So the Mission isn't cheap, not by a long stretch, but what is created in that kitchen is culinary artwork, and combined with their very friendly staff and cozy atmosphere, I think the Mission is doing everything right.",15,14,13

Being by myself, I ventured through the cool outdoor patio area and into the renovated historic building and found a seat at the bar.   Greeted by a friendly face, I ordered a drink and took a look a the menu.    I was surprised to see how limited it was, but it didn't really matter, I found something I could sink my teeth into.

I ordered the short rib tacos and brussel sprout tacos.   The bartender said ""You know you're ordering 6 taco's right?""  Haha.  Yes I know.   Being on a low carb diet, my intentions are just to eat the innards and these are about half the size of normal tacos.

Although a tad on the pricey side for the amount you get, both were absolutely delicious and I highly recommend this combo!  Getting a nice flavorful beef followed by a tangy vegetable was making my taste buds do a happy dance!

He had a great personality and made our experience even more enjoyable.  So all in all our service was top notch!

Amazing atmosphere, decor, food, and service. 

There were eight of us, and each one of us loved everything we got. To start, the chips and salsa were addicting. We couldn't stop. I got tacos with a side of corn - also amazing. Portions seemed small, but nonetheless we were stuffed!

We sat outside, and a few of us, including the bride-to-be, got pooped on, but I think everything trumped that one uncontrollable mishap. That's how great everything was.

The server also brought us a round of fancy tequila to celebrate the bachelorette party. Super nice of him, even prior to getting pooped on!

As of now I will give The Mission 4.5 stars out of 5 only because we did not have any entrees, we split several appetizers, so I can't give that extra half star or even maybe take that half star away.

   We split the brisket torta, which was heavenly.  After my first bite I was in love.  The aji amarillo sauce I could spread all over everything I eat.  Next we had the Almejas Al Vapor and all I have to say is that this soup is transcendental.  I have never tasted anything like this before.  The broth is a yellow pepper base and I never knew you could get this type of sublime flavor from a yellow pepper.  Clams, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo, and roast corn.  Please bring me more of this delicious soup!!!

   Then our bartender \/ waiter brought us out a complimentary order of the grilled street corn.  I do have to say that I am not a fan of spicy food whatsoever but the chile paprika and cojita sauce was done so tastefully that I extremely enjoyed it.

   The decor, is intimate.  This is a place you would love to take someone to impress them.  Candle holders carved out of Peruvian sea salt, a classy act right there.

We immediately ordered the guacamole and chips for appetizers.  I really enjoy their table side guac all the time as a starter. I would have wanted it much spicier, but I am not sure how much the rest of my guests would of appreciated that.
I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos. Yes, they are very small, but they definitely filled me up. Cooked to perfection always. The wine we ordered also complemented the meal.

The cocktail list looked good, but opted for the red sangria, which was pretty good. 

For appetizers, we had the crispy cola pork belly. If you get nothing else, get this! The texture and flavors were amazing. We also had the duck empanada which was flaky and good, but the pork belly won hands down in the appetizer round. 

The Chorizo Porchetta was really flavorful and the meat was so tender you could eat it with a spoon. The white bean puree was our favorite side. We also got the creamy grits, there was just something off about these I couldn't put my finger on. The were slightly sour and only a little spicy. I kept eating them thinking they would get better, nope. 

The other thing we had were the scallops. The sauce was excellent and the scallops were cooked perfectly. The serrano ham on the scallops was a bit too crispy, and crumbled like bacon when I tried to cut it, I was trying to get a bit in every bite.

Loved that the guacamole was made fresh at your table...and it was delish! Chips were nice and warm too!!  I figured if I could not decide on what to order from the menu, I would just order more guacamole...but I settled on trying the Marinated Jidori Chicken  which is plated with grilled mushroom, Oaxacan cheesy rice, chile verde & fermented black bean sauce (I was able to get something with chile verde seasoning.)  AND it was fantastic! The flavors put together were phenomenal. I enjoyed every last bite, and it definitely made up for not being able to fulfill my initial craving. Also, the Pineapple Ginger Mojitos and Cucumber Jalapeno Margaritas were light and refreshing, too.

Our server, Tony, was friendly and efficient...helpful
in clarifying specific dishes, etc. Our water glasses were never empty (although the server was the only one we came in contact with who did not have a friendly demeanor.)

So I checked Yelp and found The Mission with 4 stars reviews overall.. serves mexican food (which Arizona is known for)... and within walking distance from where I was at, so I gave it a try.
First I was confused with the church next to it but then I walked further.. and was so glad I found this restaurant.  So.. here I am ... at The Mission! 

The atmosphere is very cool... they have outdoor seating areas at the front and at the back, in the middle is the bar area and indoor seating which is very dark.
We chose to sit outdoor since they have heater and blanket.

The food? Meh! What I really don't like is: Our server offered Chips & Guacamole, and later I found out that they cost $14 which is about the same as the cost of most entrees in their menu.
Since it's Sunday we chose Sunday Pig Out, which is all you can eat pork tacos. The downside is since we sat outdoor at the back, we had to walk inside to get our pork tacos.
They tasted ok.. nothing special.
We also ordered Lunch Mahi Tacos as recommended by our server, which consists of 3 small tacos with small portion of deep fried mahi. The deep fried mahi is really really dry!

The drink? I ordered Blood Orange Margarita, again, as recommended by our server, which I later saw there was an additional $3 on the check for adding Solerno, which our server did not explain. It was served without the salt rim, it tasted just ok.

The service? Quite disappointing. Our server did not explain about the cost of Chips & Guacamole which was not on the menu. He also did not explain the additional charge on the margarita. He rarely checked our table either.

The ambiance is dim lit and Spanish styled. Lit with many candles and chandeliers, this restaurant exudes a sense of exotic culinary romance. The mosaic brick-tiled accent wall is a nice touch as well.

The staff here seemed knowledgeable but a bit robotic for my taste. I prefer the conversation between server and servee to be organic. Aside from that, to begin, we ordered a bottle of the El Coto Rioja Crianza 2007. After taking our time to enjoy some conversation and the wine, we then moved on to the table side mixed guacamole. While delicious, it is kinda pricy and most definitely worth your calories for the whole week! Ha

We were given chips and salsa along with their tasty house made guacamole. The salsa they give you with the chips was super disappointing. I felt like we were dipping our chips into a bowl of cheap store bought watered down tomato sauce. I know that sounds pretty harsh but for this venue, they should know better. It is what it is.

We then chose an appetizer to continue our culinary experience. We shared the Colorado lamb with the rice and lamb chirizo. It was very impressive in both presentation and flavor profile. I was blown away at how the flavors paired so well with one and other. Simple ingredients which are prepared correctly in order to allow the natural flavors to come through are the best, I think. I almost felt that instead of ordering an entree, we should of just had more of this delicious lamb dish!

We did agree upon an entree that we both thought intriguing: the Chirizo Porchetta (pork shoulder, chorizo, fresh rosemary, cotija, white bean puree, sweet garlic crema w\/chirizo gastrique). It was pretty tasty, however, we both agreed that the pork was a bit dry. I do believe that it either was not basted properly or it was just over done a bit. Regardless, the essence and aromas present were amazing.

To summarize, atmosphere is a 5, cleanliness 5, food\/wine 4, service 3\/4 and yes I would recommend this place to others.",2,0,0

Our waiter was also very weird. He was complaining that he had to work both inside and outside so we shouldn't expect our food anytime soon. He also told us that ""this isn't  a Mexican place and you  shouldn't expect anything you would find at a Mexican place"". Which was pretty weird cause all their food is pretty much Mexican. I ordered chicken tacos with only avocados and cheese. He told me that he would bring everything even though I didn't want it. He said I had to try the bean paste and it was just a waste of food because both me and my cousin asked for no toppings!

After trying a few restaurants here in Scottsdale and being thoroughly disappointed, The Mission really delivered. The tecate steak tacos are probably the best tacos I've ever had. The handmade corn tortilla is tiny, maybe 3 inches but is loaded up with delicious, tender skirt steak, salsa, avocado and cotija. It is the perfect taco - has a balance of flavors, and if you are like me (a carnivore) the ratio of more meat to tortilla is perfect, the salty crumbly cotija and creaminess of the avocado set off the flavorful deliciously tender skirt steak perfectly. The table side guacamole was amazing as well. So fresh and had the perfect consistency and loaded up with red onions, jalapeños, tomato, garlic, sea salt, lime and topped off with cotija and pepitas. The chips were warm, thin and crispy and seasoned well with sea salt. I hate when you get a basket of bland unsalted chips like at most Mexican restaurants. Not here.

My son got the chicken tostadas. Again, mini corn tortillas but loaded with flavor and topped with a spicy creamy sauce. Crispy and Delicious. My hubby got the pork shoulder tacos which were too sweet for my palette. Everything was fantastic! I am hoping to return one more time before we go back to LA.

This place is really happening at night. Very loud and crowded and dark. Very cool decor with crystal chandeliers hanging and a Himalayan salt wall. We were going to go here for dinner but it was just too loud and had too much going on for a newborn so we decided to go here for lunch which was perfect for us - it was not crowded or loud and we got great service.

It starts off by us calling to see the wait. We are immediately put on hold for almost 4 minutes. The waits about 45 minutes which considering it's a Saturday in old town when all the snowbirds are coming back its not bad. We get there and are told at worst an hour... Totally fine. Until they never put our name in the system. 

My fiancé goes up after quite awhile to ask how close we are to being sat when the hostess shuffles papers and then says we can just be sat right now. Which is nice except the couple that just walked in an hour after us is being told the same exact thing. We could have sat much sooner. 

Then we get sat in the bar at a corner table where my fiancé is getting bumped into by the waitress, the guacamole table and other guests. 

I order a Diet Coke and my fiancé gets a gin and tonic. My Diet Coke is forgotten and we had to ask the food runner for it 10 minutes later. 

We had the wings and street corn for an appetizer both of which were incredible but then we finished and waited 25 more minutes for our actual meal. On top of that our table was so small it almost didn't fit what we ordered. 

Again the food really is so good. It's worth the long wait (if they don't forget to put you on the actual list), but when we spend over $100 on a meal for two we would hope for a much better experience.",0,0,0

My husband and I ate at The Mission on a Wed. and even during the week reservations are needed. (Open Table)

We SHARED the:
Table Side Guacamole $12.00 (Requested Extra Spicy) -  Good but not amazing like other yelpers have described..... and it wasn't exactly table side because where we were seated on the patio wouldn't allow for the Guac. cart to come through.

Pork Shoulder (serves two) $32.00 - Amazing and not just because it's pork! The presentation of the tortillas was pleasant and the portion was more than enough for two, although we had to ask for seconds on the tortillas to finish off the great pork meat.

Drinks: Strawberry & Cinnamon Margarita - Good & Strong for a light weight like myself

My husband had some sort of Don Julio something or other.

The dessert was strange, Espresso Churros + milkshake $8.00. Wasn't a fan of the dessert but the meal overall was great.

The patio is romantic and they offer blankets if you get chilled in the evening air.

Got conned into going to Old Scotsdale.  ""It has an Old West vibe"" she says.  Yes.  If the old west was populated by fannypack-wearing seniors recently disgorged from tour buses and had tourist-trap souvenir joints as far as the eye could see.  But I digress.

Every get insanely hungry?  So hungry, you're ""HANGRY"", a combination of being angry and hungry?  That was my state of mind that afternoon.  I used Yelp to look for nearby places that might sate my appetite but, for some reason, I either couldn't find them or, upon arriving at the doorstep, they appeared less-than-favorable.  So we settled on The Mission.

We walked past it a few times before the ""HANGER"" took over me.  In we went.

The inside looked upscale and cool.  Dimly lit and nicely appointed.  We opted to sit outside. The decor was appropriately Santa Fe without overdoing the theme.  You knew you were in a place that specialized in Mexican or Tex-Mex cuisine but they weren't desperately beating you over the head with a two-pound burrito to drive the point home.

Wife had the Mojito and I had the Primarita to start.  Dangerously drinkable.  So nice I had it twice.  But, thankfully, I didn't morph into Danny Trejo and start throwing crucifix-hilted knives into nearby customers and waitstaff.  It was fresh, clean, thirst-quenching, brilliant.

The waiter was excellent and did and good job of up-selling us to the table-side guacamole.

Prepared fresh, another gentleman came and created luscious, flavorful guac in a stone mortar that would have been the envy of any alchemist.  The fresh ingredients certainly played a major role in the quality of this guacamole but I think the theater was a significant portion as well.  ORDER THIS IF YOU GO.  You will weep bitter, bitter tears in your pillow that night if you skip it.  Allergies to guacamole or anything that tastes awesome are your only excuses.

Wife had the skirt steak tacos. I had a bite and found it to be excellent.  Well-seasoned and juicy.  I had the pork tacos which, mysteriously, are only listed as a 10-pack serving2.  I enjoyed mine greatly finding them moist and flavorful.

If you are in Old Scottsdale, come here for a big-ass lunch or early dinner.  You won't be disappointed.  Have a few Primaritas.  You'll thank me.",3,3,1

We waited at the bar and ordered a couple of their 14 dollar Margharitas. I watched as the bartender was making other drinks for the waiters and noticed she was short pouring the liquors in many drinks. I used to be a bartender so it was easy to notice. So my two 14 dollar Margharitas were 
mediocre at best and must say that my wife makes a better Margharita hands down.
 So we sit down at a table on the patio and proceed to order table side Guacamole where the tableside cart wont fit between the tables. So somewhere on the patio the guacolome was made . And it took 25-30 minutes to get the Guacomole served from the time we ordered it. Then we order scallops which are the worst I've tasted in sometime. The filet steak was good not great. They give you 3 bites of the poblano grits and 4 string beans like they might go broke if they fill the plate. When my wife gets done with her scallops she passes them over to me to finish. While I still have scallops on my plate the busboy comes over puts his hand on my plate and starts to remove my food without asking if I'm done. Not cool. I am not kidding but 2 minutes later the waitress comes over and starts to remove my plate without asking also. Needless to say I just wanted to get out of there. As Robert G said in his review they are trying to hustle you out when people are waiting. The manager did make good and removed scallops from the bill but the food is mediocre,the drinks are mediocre and the service sucks!!!

A face that someone makes when they don't want to do extra work. We now are standing waiting for a response when she calls 2 other hostesses to help her look at availability on her computer. Um ok? They finally figure out where to put us (two people) and let us know that it will be a ten minute wait. We agree and wait. Ended up waiting 45 minutes to get seated. At last, we are put in a corner outside with no Air Conditioner....(take note it's hot as heck) We decide to just brush it off and wait to see if the food is worth it.

To my surprise our waitress was very cool and made accommodations for us like moving the heater over to our table, offering to split our dish (we shared a main and ordered several other appetizers) and offering us hot water after we pulled this next thing off...  

Because I can't drink freaking ice water when it's 30 degrees out, I asked for a cup of hot water to warm up the ice water we'd been given.  Then I realized I had a bag of tea in my purse and put it in the hot water.  When our waitress came out she look shocked and said, ""did you bring your own tea?""  Well, I hadn't planned on sneaking in tea to the restaurant it just happened to be in my purse from another event we went to before dinner and it seemed like a good idea when she brought me the hot water.  When I explained that we'd just been to the Botanic Garden's annual Holiday Luminaria event and the tea was from that, she asked if we wanted more hot water.  How cool is that?  We act like near vagabonds at the restaurant and we still get the royal treatment.  That's good service.

Oh.  You probably want to know about the food.  BEST GUACAMOLE I've ever had.  Ever.  Really.  Made table side, to order, leave out whatever you want.  Freaking amazing.  The homemade salsa also rocked the house.  I asked if there was cilantro in it (because I can't have it) and our waitress asked and returned with an answer - no.  Just good, good service even though this joint seems almost like a nightclub after 8pm.

I do not get the ratings on this restaurant by what I ordered or the environment. I ordered the street tacos. The plate came and there was three piles of meat.

No way you could pick it up and eat it like a taco. I asked and was told it was the chef's signature way of making tacos. Are you frigging kidding me!!! There was an ample amount of meat and it was good but put it on a damn tortilla big enough for me to pick it up and eat it like a taco!
On top of it I had to sit and listen to loud rap music. Really, rap music in a Mexican restaurant and it was not even Mexican rap.

I headed to the ""bathroom"" and let the hostess know I had called in advance re the birthdays and she said she would make sure the desserts happened. The end of the meal came and the waitress came over asking how we were feeling-all the girls said they were full. She then just dropped the check. WTF, totally ignored all the requests I made for recognition of a birthday. I said something to the manager when we left who proceeded to find me outside the restaurant to tell me that once the girls said they were full she decided they didn't want dessert and to ignore my requests.

I shared the mahi mahi tacos with a friend and we loved every bite of ours.  The tortilla was super small, they were kind of like tapas style, but I loved that regardless of how small the tortilla was they filled a lot in that small tortilla!  The taste was exceptional.  The other thing that I loved here were the chips and salsa, the chips are extra crispy and the salsa had the perfect amount of spice in it.  Our waiter was phenomenal as well.... Jeremy...thank you for such a great time!

You know what I mean, we all have one. It is our go to place for a special event, birthday, date or family visit. And while I have not had that many special events yet, I have had some family visits. And my parents only stay at the Saguaro hotel when they come to Phoenix. But more on that later. 

So whenever they are in town, we will go to The Mission. It is just a great place for a nice dinner without it being too stuffy. While every meal I have had there has been great, I cant honestly remember what I ate. But I do remember the guacamole. As a fat foodie, I love when a dish is prepared table side. And they do this for the guacamole, and it is the best guacamole I have ever had. How do I know this? I hate guacamole. I try to never eat on purpose, but when I go to The Mission that part of me dies. And I inhale this stuff. So you have to try the guacamole is what I am getting at. And order their house margarita or their Blood Orange margarita (if it is still on the menu). Another thing that becomes costly, because they go down so smooth and taste so good before you know it your a little drunk. 

I have never had service problems. And both times I have gone, it has been packed. And while it does get loud, you can still hear yourself. Try to get a seat outside in the back. Nothing fancy about it but it just a great outside setting that is not patio or Jimmy Buffet themed (sorry, tex-mex places with outdoor seating usually go down the Buffet route).

Just factual, but a close friend in the restaurant biz once said, ""Don't eat anything you can't see"". She would never eat here, I guess. Waiters have a pocket light for your use, though. For menu, not food (unless you want that). I am probably a lot more forgiving of small portions because of all my NYC meals. The quality of every ingredient here was top-notch. We started with wings, eight wing tip only pieces, in a spicy sweet sauce. Perfect cook on the wings but not much for the money. Flavor was yummy, so we forgave the size. We needed room anyways. We had the pork shoulder tacos for two. One issue, it came with this TINY tray of cheese, cilantro and onion.  Like a tablespoon of each. For ten tacos. The homemade taco shells were 3"" in diameter. You got ten of these for two people. The delicious sauce was supplied in ONE small dish. Not everyone likes sharing dirty spoons, so my biggest suggestion would be two servings of toppings and sauce for the $32 price, I mean really. Its sounding negative but I will tell you this, the pork shoulder meat, fork tender, was the single best piece of the pig I have ever had. Worth every cent. We had lots left over. No toppings left, because well, most stuck to the spoon. The pumpkin bread pudding was good, lots of crunchy bits that we couldn't see so was worrisome at times. This is AZ, you know. The street corn is also worth the visit. Spicy and hot with cheese and sauce soaking it. You have to try this. So, my advice to make tis the best night EVER, have lots of money in your pocket and no bills due. Sit outside and book early (you will need reservations which you can make on their website), and ask for extra toppings if you need them, do not be shy. And do not waste this place on a so-so date.

I particularly liked the fact that it isn't limited to a particular country and incorporates dishes from a variety of Latin American countries.   I came for lunch so I'm unsure of how the dinner menu plays out.

  For lunch,  I started with the cheese plate.  They give you one cheese,  a huge piece, but you can get others for some more money.  In addition to the cheese you get serrano ham, chorizo, a green spicy sauce, apple, Chilean honey, bread and maybe some other stuff I can't recall.  The honey was amazing!  The cheese, Neyat I think,  was a legit cheese.

I also had the chicken arepas.  It is essentially a bunch of awesome stuff, chicken, onions, some sauce...etc on a corn based bread.  Excellent.

And that, my friends, is what I thought of The Mission.",1,0,0

- Pork Belly: decent. The coolest thing about this dish though, is the fact that the tortilla was served on this giant brick of clear salt - super cool.
- Salsa: SPICY and tasty
- Guacamole: THE BEST GUAC I HAVE EVER HAD! It was made right next to the table after you order it. It has pumpkin seeds, and I don't know what kind of crack, but i could not stop eating it.

And for entree, I had
- Hangar Steak with house margarita, which were just okay. Apparently the steak taco is supposed to be very good, maybe i should have ordered that instead.

The Mission offers up gourmet latin-inspired creations in a dimly-lit, totally chic setting, with decor reminiscent of its days as a pueblo church.  We went on a Saturday night, and it was a good thing I made a reservation - the place was PACKED!  The bar was packed, the tables were packed, even the aisles were packed!   

To eat:

*Crispy Cola Pork - Tasty, but seemed more asian than latin-inspired.  Close your eyes and you might think you're eating an extra-sweet teriyaki lettuce wrap.

*Duck Empanadas w\/ Foie - Pass on this one.  The foie was strangely spongy and the empanada crust was very tough and mealy.  Filling was bland.  All around fail.

*Mahi Mahi Tacos - $14 gets you two lipstick-sized tacos with nothing on the side.  Same goes for all the taco dishes.  Very bad value.

*Shortrib Asado Negro - Meat was tender and flavorful, and there was a decent portion of it.  But there was hardly any garnish to cut it - maybe 4 small bites worth.  Why skimp on black beans, plantains, and rice that cost next to nothing?  Silly.

*Espresso Churros - Delicious!  My favorite part was the milkshake - Perfectly smooth and coffee-y.  However, the main component of this dish is supposed to be the churros and for some reason there were only a few small sticks of those.

Conclusion: The Mission has an awesome-sounding menu, but most of the actual dishes fall short.  Portions are generally very scant and uneven across menu items, so be sure to ask your server about what to expect.  The food is basically good for noshing while enjoying several cocktails, looking hot, mingling, and enjoying the upbeat vibe!",0,0,0

Arriving 25 minutes after ordering I found the bar at sold out to the lovely Shae. Every seat was filled. Every employee that I interacted with was great!  Even while on hold placing the order. I was tended to several times with an update as to when my order would be taken. FOOD, let's get to the food. The Butternut Squash Tacos were the most petite little things. Seemingly small portioned these tacos were satisfying. The squash was perfectly cooked and there was a blend of black beans and sun flower seed to lend some protein. The guacamole was unique with Parmesan, sun flowers and a bit of smoke. The salsa was also an Arbol smoky.  The HEAT challenged my mojo. I thought I wanted a 7 out of 10 kind of heat. They gave me mild with a side of the pure goodness. The smoke definitely comes from the hot sauce. It's a heat that build for a few seconds and lights on fire when you try to wash it down.

My friend had been here before and we actually got the same experienced and fantastic server.  Elisha, in addition to being the cutest little thing ever, was knowledgeable and knew when to check in and offer suggestions.

We got the Elderflower Paloma cocktail and the Ginger Cilantro drink both delicious and not overpowering.  Food wise we split appetizers which was perfect for a night of drinking.  Not too much but also not too little so that we were drunk stumbling around looking for a taco truck at 2 am.  

We ordered the crisp pork belly placed artistically on little gem lettuce cups.  They had a coca cola glaze and were crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside.  We also got the chicken empanada a delightful and flavorful burst of tastiness on a crisp handcooked shell.  Also a highlight was the tableside guacamole.  The busboy brings over a cart and mixes all the magic at the table and asks what your preference is from mild to hot.  He created a zesty and spicy but not overpowering medium to hot guac that made our chips disappear in no time!

Simple things like management presence and the constant refill of my water glass made me appreciate the well oiled machine that is The Mission.

The ambiance is old meets new (of course it's in an old mission) with dimly lit candles and modern southwestern decor that makes it ideal for a date, casual dinner, drinks at the bar, or small gathering.

The weather was actually tolerable out last night so we opted to eat outside, which I honestly preferred since it is so dark inside the actual restaurant.  Our server, Kate was amazing.  She was knowledgeable and quirky and gave great recommendations. To drink, my bf ordered a Negra Modelo and I ordered the watermelon basil mojito. It was delicious and also quite strong!  Maybe it was because I had skipped lunch that day but man it hit me fast!  We started with some chips and salsa and an order of grilled street corn cut off the cob.  Street corn is one of the foods that I can't resist and can be a make or break for me with Mexican restaurants.  The Mission's take on it was fantastic!  I can't emphasize enough how fresh the corn was.  So delicious!  
For our entree we split the pork shoulder tacos since an order serves 2 along with a side of white bean puree per Kate's recommendation. The meal comes deconstructed with a large serving of pork shoulder, a side of red onions, cilantro, cotija cheese and a pineapple habanero glaze with 10 small tortillas served on a Himalayan salt rock.  The pork shoulder was some of the best I've had and the pineapple habanero glaze provided the perfect balance of sweet and savory.

The much raved table side guacamole is fine and fresh but not quite as memorable as I would have hoped.  The papaya salad was downright sad.

The chimichurri hangar steak was good but very standard for what you would find at any Argentinean restaurant.

During this -- my second -- Scottsdale trip, I tried as many guacamole dishes and tequilas as possible in four days.  The reposado flight here had a lot of turbulence.

The scallops were the best I've ever had - they simply melted in my mouth! The smoked banana pieces that were on the plate were pretty and all, but I did not like them (nor did the people at the next table who we let try them).

Our stomachs so full that we could not even order dessert (shouldn't have had the chips and salsa the waiter brought out twice). But, our new friends from the next table did give me a taste of the pumpkin bread pudding and it was exceptional! I will definitely save room for that next time.

Well, don't be like us - Go Now! The Mission is great and not at all what I expected (in a good way). By looking at the menu online I thought this was going to be a stuffy, overpriced, quiet, boring ""Upscale Mexican"" restaurant OR a Mexican restaurant in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale with great decor and awful food- wrong! 

First of all, unlike so many places in the Valley, The Mission is a standalone building (aka you're not in a strip mall or shopping center. There's a quaint front patio with an over sized fireplace. Then, you walk inside to a dark, chandelier (lots of them) lit bar area and restaurant. The bar was packed, the music was turned up loud and the vibe was great. We were happy to wait for a table because we got to spend some time looking around inside and enjoying the bar. Unbeknownst to us, the restaurant didn't stop there. We were escorted to the adorable back patio covered with lights, a fountain and screened in by tall green trees. I give the vibe and decor two thumbs up. 

So what about the food? So good! As recommended by everyone on Yelp, we did the table-side guacamole and it didn't disappoint. My husband and his dad ordered the pulled pork tacos that included 10 small tortillas on a salt brick to keep them warm - so cool - and all the fixings. They loved them. I had the fish tacos which was absolutely delicious. Don't be fooled by the small portions - the flavors are big and after chips, salsa and guacamole you're perfectly content. 

This restaurant is a great spot for just about anything... a date night, girls night out, dinner with parents, out of town visitors, clients...  We'll absolutely be back.",3,1,2

The service is good, the ambiance is fun, the prices are excellent for the portions. 

We had a little of a lot of things, but our favorite was the table side guac, and also the corn. We loved the pork tacos in the soda marinade (I know I am butchering the name) and wished we had two orders!

The first visit was for our company holiday party. We started inside at the bar for cocktails and appetizers. I ordered a coconut margarita that was amazing. Honestly, that was the star of the night. 

After the holiday party, my husband and I stopped by for dinner one night. We sat on the back patio, which feels comfy and intimate - like someone's backyard. There are lights strung up, white patio furniture, and random bushes\/trellises to round out the foliage. For dinner, I ordered the scallops - which were delicious. Overall, we had a fun evening. 

My third and most recent visit was with my in-laws. My father-in-law read about their tableside guacamole in a magazine and was dying to try it. Thus, we stopped by on a busy Saturday night. Unfortunately, we didn't call ahead and make reservations but rather showed up and had to put our name on the list. The hostesses were extremely nice and told us the wait would be roughly 45 minutes. We went to another nearby restaurant for drinks and after 45 minutes, walked back to The Mission. We told the hostess we wouldn't mind sitting outside and they were quick to seat us. We ordered the tableside guac (not as exciting as my father-in-law thought it would be) but delicious. Since they make it tableside, you can say yay or nay to ingredients if you are a picky eater (which my father-in-law is). We also ordered a round of margaritas. I tried to blood orange margarita - which was good but not very sweet. They no longer have the coconut margarita on their cocktail list, which I sorely miss!  For our entrée, my husband and I split the chorizo porchetta - pork shoulder, chorizo, and white bean puree. It was melt in your mouth perfect. So tender, juicy, and flavorful. I would come back for this alone! 

Overall, The Mission is a great place for an intimate date, anniversary, or a place to take friends\/family if you want to impress them.",3,2,3

I had the butternut squash tacos which looked wonderful--extremely colorful, but were also on the bland side in spite of the fresh lime wedges and slices of red chili (these tacos were also a bit pricey, $12 for 3 and the tortillas were the size of small sugar cookies).

Setting prejudices aside and deciding to let the food do the talking I was pleasantly surprised.  Full review with pictures is in my blog, highlight dishes are below:

With the kitchen moving surprisingly quickly despite (or perhaps because of) the late hour it would be perhaps fifteen minutes before our first course of the evening would arrive and although something I'd not have traditionally ordered the Almejas Al Vapor would prove to be well worth its ""best in the valley"" designation.  Described as Peruvian in origin and served in a large low-bowl along with dense ""pan de yucca"" bread with a good sponge for dipping this complex amalgam of spicy aji Amarillo chile powder, tender clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, roast corn, basil, garlic, and turmeric was everything its ingredients suggested and then some - hot and spicy, smoky and garlicky, sweet but saline, and all the while complex without being overwhelming.  While I personally could have stood for just a bit less salt and a touch more sweet to temper the spice this was a small quibble balanced nicely by the sweet rolls.

For the second of this round of appetizers my favorite plate of the meal would be presented as ""Duck Carnitas Empanada,"" an invariably upscale take on the traditional empanada with a golden flaky shell harboring orange glazed duck confit and an admixture of habaneros, mushrooms, cilantro, and queso Oaxaca.  Delectable on its own but certainly open to further adornment the empanada was subsequently topped with a chunk of seared foie gras and finally with a foie fortified queso Oaxaca pan sauce and a drizzle of tamarind oil with the end result sweet, savory, and totally decadent.

Left with a bit more time to digest and a lot less noise as the restaurant's population had literally dwindled by half a mere forty-five minutes after we were seated the final savory of the evening would arrive just after 11pm and as I was doing the ordering it just so happened to be a second round of my favorite fowl, this time the ""Green Chile Duck Confit.""  Ample in portion and more so in flavor this pile of two legs and two thighs featured a whole lot of duck for the dollar but unfortunately was just a bit less crispy than one would have hoped - a small quibble as it was not greasy, but not ""textbook"" confit by any means.  Again spicy without being ""hot"" the duck subsequently topped with sultana serrano peanut mole and paired on the plate with savory ""cheesy fried hominy"" that tasted something like a cross between popcorn and corn nuts plus smoked mushrooms to help ground the rest of the flavors.

For dessert The Mission's Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Scotch, Caramel, Pepitas, Pomeganate, and Chipotle seasonings was quite outstanding.  Beginning first with the pudding, almost a steamed sticky pudding in texture, the flavor of the pumpkin, cinnamon, and clove was present in spades and the scotch tones blended nicely with the sweet caramel giving it all a heavy handed boozy bite.  With a touch of spice from the chipotle cooled by quickly melting dulce de leche ice cream I additionally found a lot of appeal in the pumpkin seeds and pomegranate with their respective salty and sweet crunch adding some texture.

A modest tab, particularly when split, we opted to divide the bill down the middle and with that we made our way to the streets where, as I'd been told, few people were to be found at 11:30pm even on a Saturday.  Saying our goodbyes I made my way to my car satisfied with my meal at the Mission and realizing that perhaps my bias against ""scene restaurants"" was a bit unfounded, much like my preconceptions about ""Southwest cuisine"" - a fitting conclusion to my first trip to Arizona and a bit of reassurance that I could undoubtedly live here.  Sure the city shuts down early but to be completely honest by the time we left The Mission it was already nearly 2 hours after my typical bedtime anyway.",4,2,3

The food, service and ambiance have always been fantastic...it's troubling to write this, as my experiences have never fell short of my expectations, until last week.  We called to book a small birthday party (16) on the patio; it was confirmed and invitations were sent.  

Imagine our surprise when 4 days later we were informed that the time we requested (and they confirmed) was not available, that we would need to guarantee a minimum of $100 per person, exclusive of tax\/gratuity (this was the first time anyone communicated this) and that a party of 16 was too large for them to accommodate on the patio.  Furthermore, the woman who delivered this information was outright rude and offered no suggestion as to a remedy.  

At this point, my friend (whose birthday we were planning to celebrate at The Mission) called back to speak with the same woman and attempt to understand how such a thing could have been so horribly miscommunicated and again, no apology or suggestion of remedy, rather, she defended her ""rudeness"" by saying that we were rude to her first and that there was nothing she could do.

Now, I appreciate that we were frustrated and that was apparent, however we were not to blame here, nor were we rude.  It's entirely possible that this was an isolated occurrence, however, it's important to remember that your customer's should not be made to feel that your error is theirs.",5,0,1

Hip and trendy if not a little too ""hoity-toity"" depending on the people working. Get the Pork Shoulder Tacos and start with the Guacamole. On the expensive side for Mexican food, but it's worth it and more than just typical.

Long Version: This place is always a safe bet and it's one of my go-to places when people ask me for recommendations. This is how you make Mexican food unique. The food served always exudes freshness and unique culinary expertise. The must-have for us are the Pork Shoulder Tacos which are perfectly tender and juicy, The Tableside Guacamole which has the perfect kick and zest, and the White Bean Puree which has the perfect texture and flavor.

Now on to the service. We've been here probably 12 times total and always had great service but the last time I went, the service left something to be desired. I came with one of my best friends who is well connected in the restaurant scene and if it wasn't for him, we would've left. We got there on a Sunday night off-peak time with visible empty tables and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. I understand this can happen when they're holding tables for reservations, but one hostess in particular was very smug and snooty about the whole thing. Just as we decided we'd go somewhere else, my buddy saw his friend working and talked to him about getting us in. He happily obliged and got us a table within 10 minutes and continued to take very good care of us throughout the night. Perhaps this is a normal rule in the restaurant OR the hostess was just upset we bypassed her smug attitude and got in anyways, but when I asked her for an extra menu she curtly told me that she didn't have any and told me I have to take my hat off. So, just a bit of warning, even though we're in Arizona where flip flops are pretty much excepted everywhere, don't wear a hat to this restaurant even though it's also a Mexican restaurant, but it IS a higher-end one so there's that. 

Also, don't ask that hostess for a menu. She's incapable of keeping track of the one thing she's responsible for; menus. Good to have friends with connections though!",0,0,0

Food was nicely displayed, minimal portions but filling and tasty.  The server asked if we wanted dessert.  We declined.  It was time to finish our wine and think about our next destination while enjoying each others company.   Suddenly, three to four dessert plates are delivered to our table.  Hhhmm, who ordered this?  It was a big table, I assumed someone wanted to share the full course dining experience.  I didn't think to inquire further.  The server again, asks if we want to do shots.  yea, no dude.  Stop with the shots.  Not interested.  A few minutes later a tray of shots shows up....Weird!  Nobody seemed interested the last few times our server asked.  But here they are so bottoms up

The bills arrives approximately $800.  Tips included.  Wow.  Okay, we split it.  We continue to consume our drinks and talk.  Minutes later, the manager ( I assume since we hadn't been graced with his presence prior to this event)  comes to our table to encourage us to leave as the restaurant is filling and they need the table.  Really?  Are you Eff-ing kidding me.  We just dropped almost a grand and have been served a full course meal and you want us to wrap it up.  

Outside we are discussing this last event and our dining experience... come to find out, no one in our party ever ordered the desserts or shots!!!  Holy server manipulating and pocket padding scandal!!!


What did I expect?  Ventured into Scottsdale. The land of taking advantage.",6,3,0

After reading numerous reviews of this place on TripAdvisor I decided to give it a try during my visit to Arizona. Sadly it missed the mark. To the extent that I wonder what the others who have rated this highly have used as a benchmark. I travel weekly for work & therefore eat out often across the nation so I have a lot of experiences to compare this to. 

Food: 
I was torn between the fish or chicken. I asked if I could get 1 chicken and 2 fish however I was told they do not allow mixing meats. So I asked if I ordered fish tacos if I could have 1 fried and 2 grilled. I was then told customizations are not allowed. Being mindful of my health I prefer not to over indulge in fried food however I definitely wanted to try a variety since I don't live in AZ & reviews made this sounds like the best place ever. Ultimately I ordered the chicken tacos since my server said it was made of grilled chicken breast and I think it's tough to mess up a chicken taco. I was wrong. There were 3 tacos for $12 and about the size of my palm (I have small hands); they do not come with any sides. Contrary to what I was told they were not chicken breast. The flavor of the chicken was subpar and I had to pull off the fat that outlined the pieces of chicken. Aside from this I wasn't offered chips and salsa so I'm
Not sure what the requirements are for that but I imagine it's a purchase of some sort. 

I was surprised to learn that a restaurant attempting to classify itself has fine dining or upscale doesn't make any effort to accommodate guests. Quite different from
Most restaurants that truly fall into that class. Quite honestly there is more hospitality and service at Chick-fil-A and the food is better. 

Drink:
I ordered The Missionary which is a signature cocktail. They blend red sangria and their house margarita. It's more sweet than I like for cocktails. I asked my server if it was sweet before I ordered it and he said no. I had asked for drink recommendations. He didn't have much to offer however I heard him tell the table next to me how much he enjoyed the organic margarita. I wish I had received similar advice

Service:
One of the least accommodating restaurants I've ever been to. Working in the industry as a consultant perhaps I have a high bar. But for a high price tag and high claim in dining class this restaurant would do themselves  a service by researching trends in customer expectations and preferences. They will learn a number of things including that trends indicate customers prefer restaurants that allow customization, and highly value customer service.",3,1,0

I ordered what I though was black bean tacos, and out came this (forgive my lack of correct terminology) large English muffin looking thing. Confused, I asked the waiter ""what is this, I though I ordered tacos"" and long story short, I didn't. Convinced to make it right, the manager and chef came out to ask what the issue was. Surprised by their desire to want to make it right I took off the egg and ate half of it. It actually was good. Not at all what I was thinking or had in mind. 

The took my meal off the tab, which was completely unnecessary because it was my stupidity that got me in the position in the first place. Moral of the story: read the menu. Correctly. And if it comes out wrong, give it a shot.

The atmosphere is beautiful--candles, chandeliers, and mirrors everywhere--along with tall, attractive patrons. I felt very short as I was waiting for my table with a bunch of other people. It was quite busy (Saturday night), and even though we had a reservation, we still had to wait 20 minutes. But, once we sat down and got drinks--a Smokey margarita and a pear and basil margarita--I immediately felt more content. Both margaritas were good. The pear one was perhaps a little too sweet to go with dinner but would be great as a happy hour drink.

The food was good, and we ordered way too much. We had: tableside guac with chips and salsa, delicious Peruvian stew, a chicken dish and black halibut (usually black cod). My chicken dish was humongous, which caught me off guard. I could barely finish it, but I can't wait to eat the leftovers. The sauce on the roasted chicken was spicy and delicious. It came with mission fries, which are a mixture of sweet potato and regular fries spiced with cumin and lime.

The service was friendly and prompt but not rushed. I appreciated that they let us take our time even though the place was packed. I asked the waitress to bring a special dessert for my bf's birthday, and they brought out their signature dessert, the pumpkin bread pudding, along with two lit sparklers that sat upright in a lime. The dessert was full of caramel goodness, and I just ""had"" to break my dessert fast to have a few bites.

Wife had Mahi Mahi tacos and she loved them.  They were indeed flavourful with the escabeche.  My Malbec braised short-rib was exquisite.  The scalloped-like potatoes didn't make the dish too heavy and the meat needed no knife to cut through.

I had dinner here with my family for my brother's 28th birthday. The interior is very warm and dark. There appeared to be a nice bar area and the dining area was nice and open. I did like the way they presented the menus. They had this leather bound cover and it fit very well with the decor. 

We started with a table side guacamole. It was good. The guy that prepared it gave us a play by play and had very infomercial type voice. A little annoying. I almost felt bad for him. The portion wasn't very big however. The chips and salsa were good, but when is that bad. The selection on the menu is quite small and if you are vegetarian there are no options. I had the swordfish with a shrimp ceviche and rice. It was actually very good, but the portion was small by eating out standards. I actuality it was probably the perfect amount of food. The pork and chorizo was a hit at the table as well. I was also able to try the scallops. They were good, but a tad undercooked. 

Here is what makes me worry about their staying power. The server to diner ratio was probably 2:1. We must have had at least 7 different people help out our table. We noticed a lot of other servers, runners, bussers, hostesses, and managers milling about. How can they afford to pay all of these people? Oh yeah, the food is on the expensive side.

I started with the Mango and Jicama salad (no cheese), and it was light and refreshing. 

The drink menu was impressive, and I decided on the Primarita. It was crisp with a little bite to it - perfect! 

I sipped my drink while I enjoyed the Tecate Skirt Steak tacos, which were incredible. The meat was flavorful and tender; the spices perfect. The portion size was a little small - the corn tortillas were silver-dollar size - which perhaps explains how the Primarita went straight to my head?

Ordinarily we wouldn't have been able to get seated quickly without a reservation, but they had a table for two opened up that they said was reserved in an hour and a half, which is plenty enough for dinner. 

The service was great and quick. We got the tableside guacamole to start, which was prepared right in front of us! Our main course arrived about 30 seconds after the guacamole was finished, which was strange, but we didn't complain. We got the pork shoulder tacos which comes with corn tortillas on a salt block. I found this a really interesting concept. You would just rub the tortilla on the block and the salt would transfer. The pork was so juicy and the sweet sauce that came with it was divine. We ordered the Guatemalan chocolate pastilla, which was probably the most unpleasant part of the meal, even though it tasted fine. It sort of looked like poop, which was unnerving. Lol.

If this woman truly was the manager, I am shocked they would employee such a rude and hateful woman and put her in charge of working with customers. This is the least accommodating restaurant I've ever been too. The summary here is: if you have a large party of 12 or more, don't bother coming here unless you plan on reserving through a private event and paying for the prix-fix menu, otherwise they will treat you like dirt on the ground and make your party sit in two separate tables across the patio from each other. When we *gasp* even attempted to ask the rudest manager alive if we could pull another table together that was closest to our largest table, her eyes and glare could cut glass as she very rudely said no and didn't even attempt to try to work with us. When we asked why we couldn't sit at a table similar to the TWO other large party tables next to us and why our tables couldn't have been pushed together, she harshly said how those were for ""private parties."" Aka the people who paid their ridiculous prix-fix prices. Our reservation was for 8:15 and they didn't even seat us until close to 9, at which point tables on the patio were starting to leave and a restaurant with the slightest level of customer service would have accommodated us. 

We came here for my friend's bachelorette party dinner who had read amazing reviews about this restaurant. I had been here several times over the years and never experienced such rudeness.

I'll admit, I was hesitant to go when my brother suggested it. I assumed it would be trendy, touristy and kinda show-offy which are 3 things I am not, but it wasn't like that at all. 

We met here for dinner New Year's Day and this place was packed. We had a reservation for indoor, but decided to change it to outdoor. There was a 10 minute wait for a seat so the hostess gave us complimentary mini margaritas. There is outdoor seating in the front of the restaurant which is kinda small and intrusive so I was delighted when we were led to the back outdoor area. It was spacious and nicely decorated. There were several large heaters throughout the patio which kept us comfortable. 

We started out with chips and the best salsa I've ever had....it was so good we ordered another bowl. We also got mission fries & guac. The guac was very original: avocado, cheese, onion, cilantro, tomato, lime and pumpkin seeds. It was great. I went with the pork belly lettuce wraps, 3 come in a serving. I think I died and went to heaven, I only wish I had 10 more. My husband got the chimichurri hangar steak. He asked for medium, but it was more like rare. I don't eat red meat that often and the fact that it was literally red turned me off. My brother ordered the mahi mahi tacos, 3 come in a serving. The waited suggested he order a 4th taco because they are on the small side. The tacos were fabulous. He aslo got a side of Tennessee, chipotle grits. They were creamy, smoky and yummy.

I am very happy to have been able to visit The Mission on my first visit to Scottsdale.  I had a late dinner reservation at 8:45 on a Friday and expected the restaurant to be halfway empty, but when I arrived, I was glad I had a reservation as it was packed and people were still flowing in.  There was another party in front of us when we walked in, but immediately we were also greeted by staff\/manager to note our party size.  After mentioning our reservation, the hostess was notified to get us our table.  Service so far so good.

Everything on the menu sounded so good, we really needed some recommendations for our first time.  Sam was amazing and explained the entire menu with recommendations to the most popular dishes including history and back stories on the dishes including info on the chef.  After hearing everything, I really wished there was a tasting menu, and after hearing that, Sam offered to order for me.  I didn't go for it this time, but next time I'll definitely trust Sam.

FOOD

STARTERS \/ TAPAS
Almejas Al Vapor
peruvian clam stew + rock shrimp + chorizo + pan de yucca + aji amarillo + roast corn. Spicy. Very interesting flavors, curry-like.  I loved that it was spicy, but leave some time after this to cool the palate.

Crispy Cola Pork
pork belly + cola + lime + chiltepin + peanut + pickled red onion + gem lettuce. Like a lettuce wrap taco - solid.

Duck Carnitas Empanada
duck + foie gras + orange + habanero + oregano + mushroom + queso oaxaca. My Favorite Dish of the night.  This one empanada is huge, could be an entree.  Great flavors, amazing orange glaze. Could have a thinner crust, but I suspect its because the thing is too thick with duck meat.

ENTREES
Chimmichurri Marinated Hanger Steak
pan de bono + charred leek & scallion soubise + tomatillo salad. Cooked a perfect medium rare, but unfortunately it was pretty under seasoned. 

Scallop Tacos - 3 large diver scallops on a 3in tortilla.  Just ok, a little salty and just a tad overcooked.  I preferred a medium rare scallop.

DESSERT
Pumpkin Bread Pudding
scotch + pepitas + pomegranate. Second best dish of the night.  Fresh, hot bread pudding melts in your mouth.  Fantastic, original dessert.

DRINKS
I told Sam what I like to drink and he recommended an amazing tequila.  If you like cognac or bourbon, you'll like the Corrido anejo and extra anejo.  The extra anejo is something special with hints of vanilla and caramel.

This was my favorite dinner during my visit to Arizona.  Better that Cowboy Ciao imo.  A great place to drink with friends too.  If I return to Arizona, I am definitely coming back.",1,0,1

First the web-site.  Impressive, easy to navigate and very informative!  When you get there, you notice a very nice outside seating area.  Informal but intimate.  It is summer though, and I didn't see any misting system, so I don't know how much use this will be during the hottest months of the summer.

Once inside the doors... BEAUTIFUL! The staff is well trained and even if no one is at the hostess stand you are noticed and spoken to immediately!  The interior is beautifully appointed!  Who ever was their interior designer....rock on!  The waitress was there as soon as we were seated, was professional, made excellent recommendations and was spot on with all her knowledge in helping us with our choices.
I highly recommend the pork shoulder, very tender and juicy.  The food is prepared and presented elegantly but not presumptuous.  Portions are small but the quality is high!  If you are a big eater, this is not the place for you.  If you are into food for the taste and preparation to enjoy well prepared food that has a little bit of a different twist... this IS the place for
 you!
My negatives, and why I can't give a full five stars is because of the seating and lighting.  Although I understand that they were trying to make the most of  space, the bulk of the tables are done in long booths with chairs on the opposite side of the table.  This means that you have tables (in most cases) immediately to the left and right of you.  While conversant with your table, you are privy to the entire conversation of the tables on either side of you and vice-versa. I find this distracting.   The mane private table requires a group of at least 6.  So, privacy is limited.  The lighting is very low, which while adding to the atmosphere, does nothing for trying to read the menu.  I would be fine with this if there was enough candle light on the table to tilt your menu to to read, but that isn't even close to adequate.  If the servers offered a pen-light, that would be the ideal.
That all being said, I have no problem recommending this restaurant and will happily return.

The Short Ribs tacos had a high price tag but the portion is huge.

Our group was split into 2 groups of 8 and my table ordered a few guacamole and Street corn appetizers. 

The table-side guacamole was unique and fun. I am a guacamole snob and will say that while it wasn't the best i have had...i was still impressed with the whole presentation and diverse flavours. 
The street corn was ridiculously\/ dangerously delicious. Just leave me in a room with a shovel and a barrel of street corn and I will be a happy person. Fresh, rich, sweet, savoury...everything you would want. 
I ordered the Duck confit and was not disappointed. Where the hell has ""cheesy fried hominy"" been all my life? The richness of the confit and mole was perfectly counter-balanced by the fresh radish\/ apple salad on the plate.

The only thing that trumped the food in my eyes was the service we received from our server Crystal. As mentioned, my table was half of a group of 16 guys (Bachelor party weekend). From experience, tables of this size and demographic on a busy night are usually forgotten about and lacking in the attentiveness department (especially considering the auto-gratuity). But this was not the case with Crystal. She offered some of the best service I have ever experienced in a group setting. Friendly, attentive, patient, and prompt. 

The way our meal ended will forever be the benchmark of 4-star class service for my future dining experiences. Instead of simply dropping off one single bill of $1500+ plus auto gratuity for us 8 guys to try and split, Crystal did something I have never experienced. Without asking, she split our bill by 8 without any mistakes...not only that she even split our appetizers by 8. The BEST part? NO AUTO GRATUITY! I was blown away! This, along with everything else that had transpired lead me to leave a tip that was much larger than the auto gratuity of 18%.

Everything sounded so amazing from the signature cocktail list.  I wanted to try all of them. Be sure to ask for the strawberry coconut mojito (it's not on the menu but the bartender can make it for you upon request).  It's incredible!

The food was absolutely delicious. Our appetizer was the Duck Carnitas Empanadas.  Something I normally wouldn't order but it was to die for! Then two of us split the Mango & Jimaca Salad  - light and refreshing.  Super yummy for the summer.   My entree was the Chilean Salmon.

At the recommendation of our resort concierge and the high Yelp rating, we wanted to try The Mission.  This is not an American\/Mexican or Tex-Mex restaurant so don't go in there thinking you are getting enchiladas and tamales. The food is more traditional Mexican or Central American but with twists. Let me begin with two things. First, get there early as the place gets busy and get a bit loud if you are inside. We sat on the rear patio at 5pm on a hot day but were quite comfortable.  Secondly, ask for Kate as your waitress.  She is a foodie, is passionate about the menu and will make great suggestions for you. Now the food.

It's seldom for me to eat somewhere where everything is incredible.  The table side guacamole, perfectly cooked chips, entrees, tortillas, dessert, and coffees were all superb. The guacamole is so fresh, make sure you get the shredded cheese and pumpkin seeds on top. They add a nuance to the appetizer that I hadn't had before. As others have posted pics I won't add mine.  We ordered the Marinated Jidori Chicken and Chorizo Porchetta for the main dishes.  My wife's chicken was amazing with wonderful spices overtopped a lightly cheese blended rice.  The roasted chicken was fork tender.  Each part of the dish would stand alone but together they make the dish even bigger, flavor wise. The Porchetta was unlike anything I've had. The house made chorizo is stuffed inside pork shoulder and roasted over pecan and mesquite until it falls apart. The herbs and slices make this a truly unique dish. There is an earthy flavor to the meat with no indication of what type of meat it actually is. I just savored each bite.  I am still thinking about it the next day.  The white bean purée was a wonderful as a stand alone or as a dip for the meat.  I also ordered a side of tortillas which came out atop a warmed salt block.  The were flaky with a perfect body for rounding up all the bits and pieces.  

For dessert we orders the pumpkin bread pudding and, again, were amazed. This is the best bread pudding I've ever had.  It is served warm with a large scoop of ice cream.  There is a scotch syrup reduction in the bottom of the bowl that well compliments the bread.  Be sure to take your first bite without the ice cream so you can really taste all the spices.  The French press coffee is some of the smoothest I've had.  It is a Guatemalan bean with little acid and a full body. Sit and savor it with your dessert.  

Don't miss this place and on our next Scottsdale adventure we will be back.",0,0,0

He had a great command of the menu and was as funny and irreverent as we. Good servers are hard to find, and this fellow was superb. I think that even if the food had not been great, I still would have given high marks just for the excellent service. 

We had an early reservation, but it was dark inside. To be honest, I didn't have enuf light to read the dang menu, so I just told the guy to feed us... He did not disappoint. We had that table prepared guacamole, which didn't really blow my skirt up as much as it has been represented. I guess if you have never had it before, the procedure is worthwhile, kind of like going to Lawrys in LA and having your prime rib carved table side. Very cool, but doesn't make the stuff taste any better. KWIM?  Anyhoo, it's guacamole for Goodness sake. Ho-hum. BUT, the rest of the meal was awesome. Had the Pork belly, which was tender, succulent, well presented, and something that I could eat again and again. We had the duck thingie which was just over the top tasty, a couple of taco dishes and a great pumpkin bread pudding. Wow, that was a great meal. I'm going back for sure. There are so many good things to try, I'm gonna eat my way through the menu. 

Oh, the desk staff were nice and not snooty and the bathroom was impeccably clean; a mark of a restaurant owner that pays attention to the details. The place was loud, so not the best for quiet talk, but we met the folks at the next table and they were a hoot. Unexpected and completely delightful. We had a great time and Big Larry is going back for sure. The entire bill, BTW, was less than a hun, which was quite pleasant to see. Gave the server 30%. He was that good. Check this place out.

We ordered the chef's take on Mexican street corn (with mayo, chile, and cojita). This dish is a favorite of mine from taco trucks, but my parents (who had never tried it) were blown away by the great flavors. We also ordered the 1) the chicken street tacos, 2) the Tecate flank steak tacos, and side orders of white bean puree and a mixture of sweet potato and potato french fries. All were excellent!

Mmmm pork. Where do I start? I had the chorizo porchetta & my SO had the pork shoulder tacos. Both were melt in your mouth amazing. I finished off my entree & wanted to lick the plate clean!

I should point out that we are no strangers to upscale dining in the Mexican or Latin tradition since we live in Chicago and frequently eat at Rick Bayless' restaurants as well as Salpicon and Tanta also great examples of the new Latin-style cuisines in Chicago.

First off, the service was bad through out the meal. Our server rushed us through dinner -- I think they like to quickly turn over tables since it's a popular spot.  As courses were brought out we had to ask for the table to be cleaned and water to be refilled.  

Second, when the entrees arrived they forgot our side and second cocktail that we had ordered earlier.  When the manager came over to ask about the meal in progress, we had to point that out to him that item had yet to arrive, and he brought the items and adjusted the bill to remove the late side, a nice gesture.

A word on the Jidori chicken item -- it's a dry (over-cooked) chicken breast for which they charge $28.  Not much value there.  At $28 why not do a half chicken and charge $30?  

Also, they have halibut on the menu - but it's out of season so rather than change the menu, they told us swordfish was subbed in for the halibut.  Again, a small detail but for these sorts of prices and its reputation, The Mission should pay better attention and not coast on its reputation.

The food was delicious! I know their menu selection is limited, but the food that is on there is to die for. The chef is apparently French but working at a Latin restaurant. French and Latin fuse together to make a great combo. I had their filet and a bite of the chicken dish. Both were simply amazing. 

ALSO If you only take one thing away from this review, remember to order the guacamole appetizer. It is the best guac I've ever tasted in my life!

Going to Mission was a spur of the moment dinner idea, and we made reservations just an hour prior to dining. I would suggest reservations, we had to sit outside because they were full inside, and although they had a large and amazingly quiet fan outside, it was a bit hot. We sat by a fountain though, and that kind of made up for it, definitely will be back for more patio seating here when the weather cools down.

The waiter was very attentive, I think in part because we were one of the first tables seated on the patio. By the way, I am talking about the back patio, not the entrance area patio- I think the one in the back is better. 

Our app was the cheese plate, we chose the cheese similar to manchengo (I don't remember the name exactly, but the waiter related it). The cheese plate came with all kinds of goodies. 

I had the kale salad for dinner, and my boyfriend the pork tacos. We also got a side of street corn, our favorite. Everything tasted great. The kale salad had tons of marcona almonds, oranges and a light dressing, the portion was large. I had a bite of the tacos and they were great, but they are small and 3 to a plate, so for bigger appetites consider getting extra tacos. 

Dinner here was great, we will be back soon.  (:",1,0,0

It started off great with a round of margaritas and we ordered the tableside guacamole.  The guacamole was delicious and we enjoyed the tableside service.  Our server Timo took our order 2 out of the 3 Pig-Out which was all you can eat pork tacos, I ordered the Crispy Rock Shrimp tacos.  We also ordered three sides for the table to share the black bean puree, papas y chorizo, and street corn.  We waited, and waited for my tacos to get their.  Our server keep saying that they could get their pork tacos but they wanted to wait for the whole order to arrive.  Well, after 45 minutes of waiting we finally had enough.  My Fiance' went to the kitchen to see what was going on with our order.  Our server said that it would be right out, well 10 minutes later my tacos arrived but no sides so we had to cancel those because frankly we had waited 55 minutes for 3 small street tacos - ridiculous!  No Manager ever came by to apologize for the lack in service.  As for the food, it was okay, besides the guacamole nothing that would make up for the lack of service.

A large ice truck delivering ice was loud, the manager, Tom,was not helpful when we decided to address this. He informed us that ""as soon as we left, he was turning the music back up."" My father had asked earlier that he turn it down, which they did. It still was on it wasn't off and no one appeared to notice the difference. I appreciate music during a meal but lowering the volume did nothing to the ambience, unlike the ice truck sitting outside the gate for 20+ minutes did. In a nutshell the manager basically said, his ice truck and music was more important than his customers. It was a very clear message and we had been so looking forward to coming here. This was my last night with my family and sadly the manager and his requirement to ""run a business"" and not concern himself with our comfort. What a great meal that ended in absolute disappointment. Come here if you choose but know that frozen water is the priority over a family of seven trying to enjoy a meal.

The entry way through the open courtyard is very inviting, the decor and lighting is classic and dark, yet hip and upbeat at the same time. The music does have a surprising range to it, but it all worked for us and it actually added another side to the dining experience that you don't usually find. It FELT like a night out at a lounge and that's what we were going for. The service was top notch: our server was knowledgeable and friendly, and the food came on time but not too fast. Gave us just enough time in between to enjoy our drinks (I recommend the Caiprihina... I had three and they are super tasty, especially in the hot weather). The manager or owner even came by at one point to ask how everything was. 

The food was delicious, and just like others have said, there are so many things to choose from! We had three dishes from the tapas menu and combined they were plenty of food for us both. We had the duck empenadas, some kind of flat gorditas, and one of the pork belly selections. My favorite was the pork, and although the duck was good, the dough on the outside was a bit too thick and overwhelmed the filling a bit. The flavors were wonderful though, and we left very satisfied and not one regret about the price. Stop by for a fun night out!",0,0,0

We next had a kale salad. I loved this salad. It had a great dressing with a kick to it. I am not sure what all went into it, though I will have it when I make it back to The Mission.

The crispy cola pork was terrific; crispy flavourful pork on a lettuce cup.

For my main course I selected the port shoulder and chorizo roll. Our awesome waitress warned us that some people found it could be a bit dry because it gets cooked 3 times. So while you're starting with a piece of meat with plenty of fat, it gets a bit dryer. I tried anyhow and agree a bit -- it was still very good and I don't regret my selection.

I had tried twice to make reservations and I couldn't get a spot. It made me want to go even more. Finally I was able to get in and have dinner.

When we walked in the place was beautiful. Dim lighting a buzz of lively chatter and happy people. We were promptly shown to our seats. It was as we had imagined. When we sat down we waited for about 5 mins until our waitress came to take our drink order. We put our drink orders and appetizer orders in. We got the Duck Confite  and Faus Gras Empanadas. It was so good. Oh man it was delicious. After about 15 mins I started to worry about why our waitress had not come to take our order. I had finished my drink and didn't get a water refill. By this time I was frustrated. It was until 38 mins later did our waitress come back to take our order. I was livid but she came with a bit of an attitude. I had noticed it in the beginning and now it was apparent that she was acting as if she didn't want to be there and we were an inconvenience. It started to get warm, very warm. She came back and asked us if we needed anything else and before we could answer she walked off. The drink I had ordered was good but the Margarita we had ordered wasn't the one we ordered and when we politely asked her to get the right drink we ordered she rudely replied ""I don't understand, that's what you ordered, *rolled her eyes* well what else would you like?""  We replied with ""um well I'll just have a classic margarita, no salt on the rim"" and she replied with ""are you sure?"" Which then I answered ""oh we are sure sweetheart, we would rather not wait 39 mins to receive our drinks"" the food was good but small small
Portions. The margarita we received had a salt rim and was not worth the $13 charged. We were also charged the drink we asked to not be charged for bc we didn't order it. 

When we told her that our drink had that charge she replied with ""well I guess I can go take that off"" she replied with a ""nevermind"" we paid and left.

Restaurant is located in the heart of Scottsdale. It has great ambience and elegant decor, so it does give a feel of a fancy night out. Though menu has limited vegetarian options but I was happy with whatever I had tried.  However, after my second visit, I am kind of second guessing myself! Today me and my husband thought of trying it again during the lunch hour. Place was sparsely occupied may be because we reached after 3:00 PM. They had limited lunch options but more than that we were disappointed with the consistency of the food. They tasted much better the first time than this time. We'd ordered Guacamole and Tortilla chips which was fine, nothing spectacular! It came with red salsa which was very salty. We also ordered butternut squash Taco and they said they were out of butternut squash and they will replace it with 'mushroom' and 'corn', which is acceptable but what they brought was not acceptable. All they served me was corn on corn tortilla with no trace of mushroom. For that price all they could offer was corn filling, really?? I did mention to the server but he tried to convince me that it had mushroom. I wish I had taken a picture! I did like the pumpkin pudding but definitely not visiting again for the pudding. Overall, today was an average experience!",0,0,0

It leaves no room for doubt that this is a business that has achieved the ultimate mastery of its craft.  If the purpose of the ""The Mission"" was to create an experience of latin flavors that both excite and dominate your palette with brutal efficiency, they indeed deserve this 5 star review.

On a rare occasion you get to experience something new.  Both my wife and I love latin food and we had heard plenty of buzz that The Mission was the place to go to feed this hunger.  The old world style of the restaurant is matched by the decor and place settings.  You get the feeling that you are somewhere deep within Mexico or Argentina once you take your seat.  The wait staff was courteous and explained each and every aspect to the menu.  From the delectable seafood soup to the various tapas and main dishes, we were well informed on what we could expect.

We tried a little bit of everything and I cant say as I have tried anything more delectable than the south of the border treats set before us.  Each dish gave a unique experience and flavor that kept the table quiet as we tried to mastermind how to describe these tastes.  

If you want an evening out that will give you no less than an amazing meal with a lot to talk about afterwords, you should make The Mission your mission.",1,0,0

Memorial Day Weekend was spent in the Scottsdale area this year. The girls and I got to AZ and instantly needed Mexican Food. They being from Los Angeles and me from San Francisco. We met some friends at the pool and one of them recommended The Mission, as his good friend Brian owned the place, of course we went.
Upon entering the Goth meets Catholic Church (in a GOOD WAY), adorned place we were seated immediately and greeted by what must be the BEST staff in Scottsdale. Noah the BRAVE and Brilliant was our server-one word-AWESOME!
We were asked if we wanted drinks and while hemming and hawing about it, Noah recommended the Sangria. I ordered the White, because I KNOW about White Sangria, and two others in our party of 4 ordered the red. Soon they were sipping off OUR White Sangria and asking for replacements. It's not AT ALL that the red is not tasty, its that the White, is INDESCRIBABLE. wait...I'm yelping, I HAVE to describe it. It's like a Mango-Citrus Adult Starburst Candy! 
Next came the ordering...I have NO idea what the other two ordered but we got the Pork Shoulder Tacos for two. OH MY GOD! SO good. The meat is perfectly tender and the corn tortillas are served on what I believe to be a heated stone. We had the Corn Tortillas, home made and RIDICULOUSLY good. Noah then brought us a side of the Black Bean Puree with sofrito + smoked ham hocks, AND the White Bean Puree with cotija + cumin + arugula + tomato. Both are delicious and hearty enough that you could get one of each and share.
We were so impressed with our meal that night that we returned the next night, with our Scottsdale Pals-Palmer, Mister (aka Turbo\/Sprinkler), and Ben. We were greeted by the friendly, down to earth and very HIP Brian Raab-owner. They were packed to the gills on a Saturday night Holiday Weekend but the bar had this GREAT Gothic Marble (?) family style table and we were seated there to wait for our ""real"" table. We never moved! BEST seat in the house for party's of 6 or more. ""Mission B.R"" (we give EVERYONE nicknames in Scottsdale)-the owner of this TRUE Gem of Scottsdale-, started to answer our questions about the menu, and then just said, ""you know what guys, if there are no food allergies, let me just bring you some stuff"". OKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY...yes we did.....
Out First: Just a FEW of the dishes brought to us, NOT kidding!
-Lettuce Wraps (don't know if these are on the menu but they should be! A hint of what I think might have been Peanut Sauce is gorgeously delicious)
-Mission Fries-SO fun and different.
-Duck Carnitas Empanada-Topped with Foie Gras. THIS was by far my favourite starter. It was like Puff Pastry Perogies with Gravy and Rich decadent Foie Gras to top it off.
Mini Tostadas-Precious tasty tapas.
Shrimp Anticuchos-With a sauce to die for.
Pork Confit -which was sincerely the most amazing texture and taste. This was almost reminiscent of baby back ribs with ""CRISP' to them-NO bones in this Confit, which according to MIssion B.R. is cooked all day in oil. Yesssssssssss. 
ALL starter portions are HUGE-by San Francisco standards- and to be honest I was full after just the starters. 
Main Courses: Just a few of them.
-Malbec Braised Short Ribs-Decadent Pork FEAST with a Malbec sauce that I had to ask for the recipe. I was not given it ;) 
-Pork Shoulder- SO supple and luscious, yeah I said it- I think this MIGHT be The Mission's Signature Dish. Pork FEAST! Porkalicious!
-Chilean Salmon-This dish was smokey and mild and sat atop a. sweet\/savory bean puree and light cream sauce. Buttery texture with perfectly carmalized edges. For fish lovers this dish is a must.
-Uruguayan Filet-I don't think anyone got any of this because Turbo and I ate the WHOLE thing. One of the most inventive and original tasting Filet Mignon dishes I have ever had. VERY impressive.
Desserts- I actually didn't taste any of these as I am allergic to sugar-SUX! However, if there were a sound feature on Yelp our table would have sounded like a porn movie.
-Espresso Churros-Sounded like-ummm, ohhhhh, JESUS, oh Christmas Baby Jesus these are good.
-Fried Bananas-Sounded like-moan, smack, slurp....
-A Brownie, Ice Cream, Chocolate Wet Dream thing.-Sounded like- HOLY GOD ALMIGHTY, oh oh oh oh oh oh HOOHHOHOHOHOHO GOD-DON'T STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So, in conclusion, if you happen to be in the Scottsdale area, EVER, The Mission is a must. They even have Fernet! Thanks Brian for a night to remember. AND Arizona men are the BEST. LOVE YOU PALMER, MISTER and BEN!!!!",0,0,0

We came here this past Friday night around 5;30 or so.  Over drinks and our meal, we keep discussing the term In-elasticity of demand.  That's economics, for how high you can raise prices before consumers will start cutting back.  

You see the food at The Mission is excellent!   It's delicious!  It's outstanding!  But, judging on how they pack them in, the investors who own The Mission, could easily raise prices by 10 or 20%, and no one would blink an eye.

Hopefully, you're not reading my Yelp Reviews for Economics lessons. But to find out about the dining experience and food.  LOL 

Since there is no Happy Hour at The Mission, we were lucky to get a table near the bar.  We ordered the ""made at your table"" Guacamole for $12.00.  Excellent!  If you do not believe me -- checkout the nearly half dozen photos other Yelpers have posted for this one menu item.  Yes, it's very good.  They cut up one avocado, add a pinch of salt, red onion, half a lime, cilantro, pine nuts and some grated mexican cheese. Creamy texture and yummy.

We ordered a glass of Sangria for $8.00. and a Mohito for $12.00.  Both were very good, though each had too much ice.  We also ordered off the appetizers menu the Chicken Anticuchos for $8.00, and Skirt Steak tacos for $12.00. 

The chicken comes on two skewers, with a very nice tasting mole that dominates.  It's seasoned with raisin, balsamic, sesame ,cocoa and peanuts.  Very nice.  The three small steak tacos were marinated in Tecate and smoked in their back yard. It's the smokey taste that makes the dish unique.  It also comes with green chili salsa, some diced avocado, cilantro and cotija on top.  These too were delicious and hit the spot.  

A shout-out to fellow Yelp'er Pepper T, who coined the term ""Petite proteins"" in her review.  Nicely said Pepper!  I believe it's nouveau cuisine.

We ordered one more drink before asking for the check.  The damage came to just over $69 including taxes, but before tip.  As I mention in the begining, The Mission gets very crowded and can feel claustrophobic.  It's also dark inside, and at times can be very noisy.

After the show at the Permorming Art Center down the street, we thought about coming back for dessert. But there was about twenty customers waiting outside to be seated.  Maybe next time.  In-elascity of Demand as they say.",22,17,19

Sat on the patio, it was a mellow scene outside, much louder and darker inside. 

Get the table side guacamole. It was one of the best guacamoles I'd ever had and watching the guac chef whip it up from his little cart was pretty fun. (Disclaimer: I am highly partial to the avocado and would probably eat them rotten.) 

Steak tacos were delish. So simple - steak, avocado, lime in corn tortillas. The chicken were good but not our favorite.

So you have to be with a couple of people to try different toppings. The tableside guacamole is good since you get to determine ""heat"". I loved that they put in fresh jalapeño & Serrano chiles as well as fresh garlic & lime juice. Just like I make at home. The corn appetizer is a must! You can eat it on the cob or cut off. Done it both ways - no preference. The lovely sauce they put on corn just takes it over the top. Chips are light & crisp and salsa is fresh & just the right amount of heat.

So, I was debating giving this place four stars because yes it is dark in there and yes the tables are a bit cramped and it did get loud.... but..... I just can't. The food was so good that it completely made up for those things. 

The BF and I went here for my (very very belated) birthday dinner (we had made res's somewhere else on my b day that fell through *cough* monarch *cough* and had to make new plans). So I decided to try something a bit different and go to the Mission. I am very glad I did. The BF and I made open table reservations and were seated promptly when we got there. Our waiter was this funny guy named Derek, who, at first I thought I wasn't going to like that much (I have an aversion to trendy scottsdale people) but turned out to be wonderful and make great suggestions all night! So thanks Derek!

The BF and I decided to order a few different small plates to get a feel for the restaurant. We ordered the cola crispy pork belly, the table side guac, the steak tacos, and a side of chipotle honey grits. I also got a Mission margarita. So my margarita comes out and it is really great! I have only had one other margarita that I liked equally. It was extremely fresh and it wasn't made out of that disgusting green sweet stuff that normally makes up margs. I would definitely recommend it (with salt). 

We then get the chips and salsa. The salsa is really smokey and reminds me of the salsa at Abuelos, if you've ever tried that. I liked it a lot. So the man who makes the Guac came over and asked how spicy we wanted it, and we told him hot. He then proceeded to mix the guac using all fresh ingredients. It was so good! and so fresh! I liked how I could taste each flavor that went in, from the cilantro to the delicious tomato and jalapeno.... it was all good.... also, it had pinons on it, which gave it a cool texture. I have only had one better guac, and that is at Barrio cafe.... 

We get the rest of the food, and the portions look tiny, but in reality, they are huge because I just ate half an avocado and a bagillion or so chips. The cola pork belly was Ah. Maze. Ing. I have never had anything like it. It's a crispy sweet and spicy pork with peanut sauce in a lettuce cup. It's like thai mexican fusion. It was the best of the meal. The steak tacos were also wonderful. The BF said it was like eating a new york strip in a taco. It was a little sweet and a little savory... all good. The grits were the only part that were just ok. I liked them, they were creamy and different, but I wouldn't get them again. 

So we had to get dessert, as it was my 'birthday' and Derek recommended the pumpkin bread pudding. Holy crap Derek, you are the man! This thing was one of the most delicious desserts I have had, and definitely the best bread pudding. It's pumpkin bread with a little bit of creme brulee, in a sea of wonderful butterscotch sauce (made from real scotch...mind=blown) with the perfect amount of ice cream and little crunchy seeds for texture. Whoa. Just whoa. 

All this, and the bill was like 65$... that's wonderful! We could come and not get drinks and not get grits and it would be an affordable dinner, which is the best part, because I want to go back.... like right now.",10,3,6

Ok so here I go I had the diver scallops.... Amazeballs!!!! They were grilled to perfection not at all over cooked which happens all too often with scallops! Had grille octopus on top and serano ham slices that I think were flashed fried... On top of a delicious sauce. Seriously I would injure someone for another serving. Also a great selection of wine which I'm always a fan of.
We all shared the espresso churros came with a milkshake that used all my will power not to try (lactose intolerant and all) boo for that btw.

The salad was good, but my serving was heavy on the cheese (cream cheese? or a super mild goat), while I love love Kale, I was distracted by the clumps of cheese on my plate. The tacos delivered on flavor, yet were teeny tiny! My favorite was the beef. I found the pork a little sweet for my taste, but all were flavorful as can be! We had what seemed to be bottomless chips, salsa, guacamole and delicious margaritas! I can't fail to mention the shot of tequila with a cinnamon rim and a slice of orange. What a pairing!

We ordered the guacomole that is prepared tableside and we practically licked the bowl.  The posole and kobe dog hit the spot on a chilly afternoon.  The manager, Michelle, stopped by our table and after some Facebook discussion, sent us three small avocado margeritas to taste.  OMG!

We ordered:
1- Grilled Street Corn: SO delicious. A skewer of corn with butter, chile paprika and cotija. Its spicy and just the right amount of food for a starter. 
2- Guacamole: they make it for you right at your table! You can choose how spicy you want it and can tell your guac mixer to skip the onions. :)

And last but not least...
3- Roasted Organic Butternut squash Taco's: Spicy black bean sofrito, cumin, coriander+poblano, pickled jalapeno+cotija. These are easily the most delicious vegetarian taco's I have ever had. Delicious and again, not over board on the portions.

To drink? we ordered the Bitter Bee's. Hendricks gin, lime, basil, AZ honey and grapefruit. I could tell instantly how fresh the grapefruit juice was. If t wasn't squeezed you fooled me! 

We skipped dessert because with all this goodness we were pretty full. We made a reservation for two outside around 5:45pm and had zero issues getting seated as soon as we arrived. We sat at the back patio and while the atmosphere was dimly lit and beautiful for a cozy NYE meal, there was a funky smell coming from, what we guessed, their water fountain. Slowly we became desensitized to the smell and once the food was there, we didn't really notice much else going on around us. Service was great and I can't wait to go back there again.",0,0,0

My boyfriend and I went to the Mission for our 4 year anniversary dinner because we wanted to try something new.  The Mission looks really cool inside and there are pretty chandeliers hanging around. We got drinks at the bar while our outside table finished being set up - we ordered red sangria and a Michelada style beer - both were great.

Our table was outside on the patio and it was a gorgeous night. At first our waiter seemed MIA but then he made himself more apparent. For an appetizer we ordered the Duck Carnitas Empanada and it was sooo good. Then for dinner we shared the Pork Shoulder tacos and they were awesome. The hand pressed tortillas were a little smaller than the palm of your hand and then you created your own little taco with the pork, cheese, onions and cilantro. It being our anniversary, they comped our dessert and brought out the Pumpkin Bread Pudding and it was really good, rich, and I couldn't stop eating it.

Highly recommend The Mission! I would definitely go back - so much to try on their menu.",2,0,0

I felt a little out of place though, wearing a casual t-shirt and shorts. I opted to sit outside because the lighting and atmosphere inside was a little dark and I thought it would be difficult to read the menu.

My service was excellent! My server was upbeat and friendly. He was helpful when I had questions about the menu. There was a man filling my water glass anytime it got low. He was on it, and very friendly, too!!

I ordered the Pork Shoulder tacos- 3 smaller corn tortillas topped with a pineapple glaze. They were DELICIOUS!!! I also had the Mexican Street Corn. I had the option to have it on the cob or cut off into a bowl. I opted for the cob. It was one corn cob cut in two pieces. It was covered with a cream and spices. It was SPICY. Out of this world!!

The pricing was a little on the high side. My tacos were an appropriate $10 plate, but my side of corn was $7, for one corn on the cob. It tasted great but I would have liked to see a larger serving for that price. I could have eaten a larger serving, too!!!

I went there for my second time on Saturday night and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. We got to sit out on the back patio in the beautiful evening weather that was decorated with little white lights. 

Once again I wish I remembered our server's name because he was on point. He greeted our table and shared with us some restaurant and personal favorites without missing a beat on the ingredients in each dish.

I started with the white wine sangria which was good, grapefruity in my opinion but I still liked it. Our table ordered the table side guacamole and the crispy pork & cola lime glaze as our appetizers. The table side guac is a MUST. They make it right there with about 12 ingredients (I think that's what our server said). It's fresh and creamy, just the way guac should be. The crispy pork & cola lime glaze was amazing and recommended as a restaurant favorite. It was something you can only find at the Mission, which I find important. 

For my main dish, I ordered the Tecate Skirt Steak tacos and my boyfriend got the Pork Shoulder Tacos. The little corn tortillas they prepare are yummy and in house, which is awesome. My steak tacos had a nice grill smokey taste to them. They serve three small, street style tacos but they fill you up quicker than you realize. I recommend ordering a side with the tacos however. My boyfriend and I split the grilled street corn appetizer off the cob as our side. That corn might have been my most favorite dish all night. The pork shoulder was succulent and prepared perfectly.

One of the gentlemen I was with called the place ""froo-froo Mexican."" I have to agree, it's upscale Mexican but don't let the deter you from trying it out because the flavor profiles and combinations are unique and phenomenal.

Where & how do i begin to describe a middle of the week lunch here,  that was akin to sex to the hundreth power.
You know middle of the day sex that you weren't expecting and now it's all you're thinking about and you find yourself smiling all day long ...yeah baby The mission was that damn good .

At first glance,  * curbside*  it is aesthetically pleasing,  and as you make your way inside,  the beautiful people greet you,  and escort you to your table ( our's was outside on the courtyard style patio) even in broad daylight this is a sexy place with it large brick fireplace and intimate seating ( corner booth).

Anthony  our waiter was nothing short of fabulous. You could see he takes pride in doing his job well. He asked if it was our first time and like a gentle lover he explained what we were about to experience while we let our hands and eyes travel over the heavy soft leather covered delicate pages of the menu .

The Mission is a Spanish- French fusion style eatery The chef was trained in French Cuisine and he has melded that training carefully into the Spanish style dishes .

I had the Brisket Torta (actually i think it had me)  thinly sliced  tender beef that literally melted on my tongue that was lightly drenched in a mild yet flavorful BBQ type sauce that sat atop coleslaw, which added a cool crispness to the hot soft beef.
This Torta was texturally stimulating and the Aji Amarillo gave my taste buds a subtle barely there sting. Nothing within the soft bun competed for flavor it was harmonious ..A Fait Accompli .
Presentation was lovely. The made before your eyes table side Guacamole is    wonderful. My companions lunch consisted of 3 petite beef tacos that looked amazing.

The food is not to be rushed as something so well executed needs to be savored, felt .

Like an afternoon of great lovemaking,  I  left limp, floaty, sated,  eager for more. A wicked soft grin upon my lips as i walked away. And  i had to turn back and look one more time ...

Mission accomplished ......an orgasmic experience !
5 stars for the stars in my eyes ....

Update:

I have eaten at The mission at least twice per month. I love their Mango and Jimaca salad, and the Spinach & Date salad. 

For dessert the fried bananas rock! But,  the pumpkin bread pudding...OMG OFF THE HOOK.",6,4,7

However, the first impression, from the outside, made me hesitate slightly. Primarily due to the somewhat sterile look of the place adjacent to a beautiful old church.

Glad I followed the Yelper's advice and went on in to be greeted warmly and noticed the uniqueness and beauty of the interior. The service at the bar and recommendations for lunch were very nice.

I had the on-demand, handmade guacamole which very good.  I followed the chips and guac with the short rib barbacoa tacos.  I was leaning towards the mahi mahi tacos but then...I can have those almost anywhere.   The tacos were the right choice, thanks to Ruthie the bartender's recommendation.

I would certainly look forward to visiting The Mission again during my next visit and I'd would give one of their sister restaurants a try too.

They were gonna seat us inside, which was really really dark and dingy, seems like you can't read the menu.  Today was such a beautiful day to sit in the back patio, where they had heaters, and shade and trees, so they kindly set us up a table in the back outdoors.  We so enjoyed it there.

The food was true to the reviews here, which was ""really expensive"", but really ""tasty"".  I am not sure I would return to pay so much for so little.  One Yelper said the tacos tortilla was only 3.75"" , I was laughing that he measured them, said tiny tortilla wasn't big enough to lift the filling to your mouth.   When I asked the waitress if they were indeed only 3.75"" in diameter, she said ""No, they are only 3 inches"".   I was amused, not sure if she was being facetious, but when they arrived, they looked 3 inches to ME.   3 tiny ""tacos"" for $10-$12 depending on filling, no garnishes to even eat, nothing else but those 3 tiny tacos. 

We agonized for so long over spending $6 for chips and salsa (cos it is free at other restaurants), and how many ways we were going to split the $6, that the restaurant gave us 3 orders worth $18, gratis, to our table.  

I ate pork shoulder tacos for $10.  It was really delicious!  Every bite of other people's orders was delicious too, but when we shared a bite, we were giving away a substantial portion of our lunch, because the portions were so tiny.

The lunch menu was pretty limited in choices.  I did not see the dinner menu.  

This day was our server's second day working here, but she did a great job, and was good at pouring us water, after all one particular hot sauce used to make the guacomole, if you wanted it extra hot, was making one person's face all read and teary.

I regretted not coming for lunch, which I would suggest, if you'd like a calmer ambiance. Request the back patio. The policeman's presence was curious, but I learned later he was there to watch for rowdy patrons, due to Scottsdale's bar scene. After a shade in the front patio hit my head due to the wind, I moved to another table in the patio.

The table side prepared guacamole looked great, but is quite a large portion for one. A server said I could have a taste, but didn't follow through. My server arrived, who was quite pleasant. He suggested items for vegetarians and his favorites.

He agreed on my choice of the Shaved Kale Salad. It was a generous portion, easily shared, with a delicious blend of sweet and savory, due to blood oranges, goat cheese and marcona almonds which compliment the kale. He told me the guacamole is only one size. I then chose the Roasted Organic Butternut Squash Tacos, since they are handmade. I was concerned about jalapenos but it's not a spicy dish. Beautiful presentation! Bite size tacos contain sweet butternut squash offset by a tasty mixture of spices.

I wanted dessert, but don't particularly like bread pudding, and chose it due to other Yelpers' compliments. I couldn't photograph it due to the darkness of the front patio. The pumpkin is quite subtle. It was disappointing that the ice cream had melted, and the small piece of bread pudding was almost submerged in the sauce, which created a mess. I mentioned this to my server, but he didn't offer anything else. I would choose another dessert.

We ordered drinks at the bar and was able to take them to the waiting area and enjoy ourselves rather than being stuck in a crowed place. Once our reservation came up we were seated on the patio.

What I liked:

The food: I started with the three-bean salad, which was fantastic. It was a mixture of fresh green beans, black beans and pinto beans in a semi-sweet dressing.  Great appetizer on for a hot summer day.  For my entree, I ordered the mahi-mahi tacos, which were also amazing. Three small corn tortillas (house made) topped with big chunks of flash-fried mahi, pickled red pepper, and a special sauce. My wife ordered the black cod for her entree and it was also insanely good.  The house-made guac is also a must-have at The Mission, as they prepare it at your table.  Another must-have is the grits -- make sure you order it as a side dish -- be prepared for serious spiciness though.  Someone else in our party had the pork shoulder tacos, which he loved.

The ambiance: very cool. dimly lit, modern, classy.

What I didn't like:

Service: Our server had a bit of an attitude, and they were also out of several things we wanted to order.  We arrived at 8:15 and they were already out of the main soup on the menu (five chile soup).

I HAVE ONE CONCERN
The Mission could become a victim of its own success. Maybe our couple visits were flukes but... We were a party of 4. When we got there it was PACKED. Like bar-packed, not restaurant-packed. Good for them, seriously. The owner (we knew this because we caught his episode of House Hunters Intl) seemed to personally make it his ""mission"" to keep us happy while we waited. Way cool. Kept checking in with hostess on our behalf and comped our drinks while we waited in the awkwardly crowded bar\/hostess stand area. This was all beyond the call of duty for most owners.

So what's the concern? It has obviously become a hotspot with the look-at-me crowd. Hungry, bedazzled cougars and Affliction-afflicted d-bags. And all of them were on the prowl. This is great for business and buzz initially, but it doesn't sustain you when that crowd moves on to the next hotspot. In the meantime, it's hard to become a regular patron for the food&drink when you've got that scene to battle with. On a weekend, even with a reservation, you're likely in for a wait with no good place to wait.

As others have stated, the place appears to be staffed up to the bejeezus. The amount of staff is exaggerated a bit by the shared service style. You probably feel like there are more servers than there really are because you seem to meet all of them! As The Mission inevitably transitions into a calmer, sustainable success, I imagine the frenzy of bar patrons and staff will calm a bit.

All in all, hoping they stay around long enough to transition from a 4-star hunting ground into a 5-star place for us to become regulars.

Oh, and the Churros. Oh my God.",1,2,1

And the food is definitely worth every penny. Matt Carter, the head chef has created a menu for foodies, and yet the dishes are not overthought, and portions are a good size. If you like corn soup you MUST get the Almejas al Vapor soup. Omg, it is to die for! The combination of flavors works so perfectly on the palette. I am definitely going back to try the scallops, and basically work my way up and down the menu. The cucumber jalapeño margarita is my fave, has just the right amount of kick, and isn't overly sweet. Once again, it is so perfectly balanced. Make reservations on a weekend night, this place packs up quickly!",1,0,0

First off - make a reservation and get there on time!  This place gets packed, and I can see why.  The ambiance is really nice.  Kind of laid-back, soft lighting everywhere, some pretty chandeliers and this sort of industrial look that went well with the antiquity of everything else.  Our server was AMAZING.  He took the time to go over any item on the menu and explain how it's cooked, and made great recommendations for some of our girls who were vegetarians.  

Myself, I was going to order the chorizo pork shoulder but decided to get the chicken tacos instead.  I was a little worried that I'd made a mistake with that order because when the food was served, all I got was a small plate with 3 cute lil tacos.  What I didn't realize was how packed full of delicious meat those tacos were.  They were, literally, finger licking good!  All the other girls in my party loved their food, so I think I can go as far as saying most everything on the menu is delicious.

Finally, the mixed drinks are delicious, too.  They have so many tequilas, it's mind-boggling. I had one of their mojitos and it was to die for.  The bartender also hooked us up with some kind of sweet drink in a shot glass for some of us chicks who can't handle hard liquor shots.

Anyways, I highly recommend this place!",1,0,0

Nice selection of margaritas  which is a must for a good Mexican restaurant. The claimed house special is pork shoulder. Unfortunately, I came away disappointed.

Does this place ""try too hard""?  What the H does that mean? The waiters know the menu? Good. There is alot of wait staff? Good. They push drinks? No. 

If you haven't tried the Peruvian clam stew, for first course or even for lunch, you are missing a truly refined dish. The clams and chorizo in the light golden liquid are heavenly.

We started with the cheese plate and the duck confit empanadas. Both were good but the cheese plate stood out. They took something simple and elevated it with the addition of salty & spicy peanuts and rich honey which was absolutely marvelous.

For the main dishes we had the pork shoulder stuffed with chorizo and fresh made tortillas and the Grouper. The pork and chorizo was amazing but a little heavy so I think the portion could have easily been cut in half.

He was such a sweet guy and even sent over chocolate cake at the end of the meal, complete with a sparkler.

Apparently they use them for cooking and serving as well. I know because, as I was trying to coax my husband into the ladies' room to look at how they finished the walls (really), we were intercepted by Brian (one of the owners I think) who filled us in on the design features.  He even checked the men's room for occupants before ushering me in to see the paint job in there. 

Our waiter was totally helpful when we asked about the beef anticuchos appetizer in our best canadian-billy  accents. This is an excellent appi. I totally recommend. Back to the waiter, he didn't even laugh when my husband wanted the Mahi Mahi tacos but ordered the ""Ahi-Ahi tackos ""(rhymes with rack-o. I know it's not a word.) Excellent also -- with sweet pickled peppers sliced on top. Not your average fish taco. We ate four of these lovely things between the two of us. They're really good but really small, so don't share a plate. See, that's we do, we're usually overwhelmed by the portion size at most restaurants and have learned to just order an appetizer and share a meal. Then we're usually sated. If not, it's time for dessert. 

For dessert, I had a coconut margarita. With pineapple juice and bits of toasted coconut, it was very tasty and still had a smooth tequila flavor (which I relish). 

The only thing keeping this from a five star-rating was the small portion size. We were almost home when my dude took a left instead of a right and pulled into the McDonald's drive-through. He then ordered a Big Mac and a Double Double (whatever that means) with fries. I was flummoxed and kind of scolded him with - why didn't you just order some more good food at The Mission rather than eating this garbage?.

Then I held the warm bag and smelled the fries. I ate all of them before we pulled into our diveway. So, I guess I was still hungry too but dazzled with the design and on my best behavior after getting busted for trying to sneak my guy into the girl's room.

Supposedly, it has antibacterial properties. Still, I won't be licking the wall.  

This joint is cool.  Decor is dark wood, candlelight tables, and swanky music pumping in the background. The staff is attentive. 

The star of this meal:  Roast Corn Gorditas. AMAZING.  Highly recommend this trio of goodness.  However, this shouldn't be all you get.

The shaved kale salad had a kick, courtesy of the dressing. The portion is big and can easily serve 3.

Notable mentions: Cheese plate, chicken tacos, and table side Guacamole. 

Props to the staff for correcting a snafu with one of our meals and being attentive. When one of our dishes came out with an ""unexpected"" addition, they corrected it immediately by offering us a replacement and comping dessert.

We got a tequila flight which was sloppily poured, each shotglass had differing levels of tequila which was the first turnoff.

my husband's plate arrived and it was very pretty and he loved it. My vegan tacos on the other hand were just as bland as the appetizers and was the exact same size as the appetizer!  I asked the server if there was anything else they could offer because I was not happy at all with my dish.

Ate here last night, a group of 5.  Pretty colonial mexican decor with beautiful chandeliers one of my dining partners wanted to steal. 

Server was very young, but knew the menu well. 

Home made chips and salsa.  Not much you can do with chips and salsa, but they were not...ummm...cold.

Had the $12 guacamole.  A lot like Barrio's Guac.  Table side preparation, like in Rocky Point.  People rant and rave online about the guacamole here.   It's good and all, but come on, it's f...ing guacamole.  Should have ordered the cheese plate.

Duck Carnitas Empanada.  That shit was good!  I wanted to lick my plate, but the bourbon and tequila had not yet kicked in, so I used my finger.  

Crispy Cola Pork.  Yummy.  The chiltepin made it spicy.  It was a fancy lettuce wrap, and it was delicious.  

Chipotle Caesar.  A fresh break of greenery between the meat dishes.  A little heavy on the dressing.

Pork shoulder Tacos. The meat was the star.  Silly vegetarians can eat all the salad in the world, because that leaves more pork for me.  My wife and I enjoyed the roasted pork without the little tortilla, just dipping it in the mexican BBQ sauce that was served along side.

Chimmichurri Marinated Hanger Steak.  Not a lot of chimmichurri flavor here, but the tomatillo sauce on the side was super savory and yummy.  Tequila and beer and bourbon were making me tingle, so I did lick my plate when no one was looking.  

Will eat here again.  A lot like Deseo in the Westin at Kierland, and also like  Barrio.

Another check off on my foodie list, pleasantly surprised with everything here!

Shrimp Anticuchos. -  Great start! A lot of bold flavors on a 3-shrimp skewer, do not skip it!
Chorizo Porchetta - A very rich dish for my taste, as it was recommended by our waiter. A big piece of pork shoulder had probably 35% of fat on a bed of chorizo, I got full after finishing barely half of it. If you have a big appetite, give it a shot
Malbec Braised Short rib - the guys finished this without any left, i guess this is enough said.
Espresso churro with milk shake - This is such a cute dessert, perfect to share for 3 people. Milk shake was good, though I didn't think the churro was flavorful enough as it called 'espresso churro', and they were quite oily.

The chicken was covered in a ketchup flavored BBQ sauce. That's it... It was comical that the chef actually thought of this meal. I wouldn't serve it to my 5 year old... 

My wife ordered the tacos and out of desperation I reached over and grabbed a taco. It was amazing! I couldn't believe the same restaurant would serve 2 completely different meals. I don't get it.

The place was also very loud making it difficult to converse.

We dined on a weekday evening  -- so we didn't get to experience the ""best brunch in town"" per Krashawnda N. Dang it! Now we're gonna have to go here again, after re-reading her review. :)

Hubby and I ordered: 
Mahi Mahi tacos  $14
Chicken tacos   $12
Mission fries  $6
Mission Margarita  $7


Food was good... I wouldn't say ""AMAZING""... but maybe I had the wrong expectations. First of all the tacos were shockingly smaller than expected. Three tacos per plate, and per another reviewer they truly were about 2"" across. However, they did taste divine.... (at least mine did, the chicken tacos). And honestly, now that I'm finished... any more and I would have been uncomfortably full. 

But the Mahi Mahi tacos were actually battered... we were not expecting that. And the batter was a medium coat - not thin or thick. Still edible. 

My margarita was definitely tasty!

I really enjoyed the ambiance.... it was definitely an upscale ""Latin American"" restaurant. Beautiful dark chandeliers, gorgeous illuminated salt block wall, dark hardwood floors... 

No complaints about the service. We were greeted right away and also immediately had water served to us, when we were sat. And likewise the server was appropriately attentive. 

All in all, we spent about $50 for some smaller-portioned plates -- which was more than we typically spend for dinner lately. But we had a good time.... I think it you're looking for more of a ""value"", this place might be better on the weekends for the brunch.",1,0,1

The inside is chic with authentic decor and fancy chandeliers. Unfortunately, the substance of the restaurant (food & drinks) fell flat. 

We sat on the patio for a late lunch so some of the items suggested by fellow Yelpers were not available on that menu. The restaurant was not very busy during this time so our service was quick and attentive. Here's the lowdown on what we ordered:

- Table-side guacamole: obviously b\/c it was recommended by everyone here! The portion was just enough for 2 people but not outstanding at all. In fact, it was very bland (even with all the ingredients added to it). For $12, I expected much more.
- Short Rib Barbacoa Taco: topped with a massive slice of pickle on top, I wasn't sure if this was for presentation or they were too lazy to cut it into smaller pieces for easier handling. At least the pickle gave it some bite, which is more than I can say for the other Taco.
- Skirt Steak Taco: the steak was chewy and the taco as a whole was very bland. I had to dip it in the salsa that came with the guacamole to add taste to it. I wouldn't recommend ordering this on a date b\/c you'll be too busy trying to chew the steak to talk.
- Drinks: Papaya blended margarita. They usually have 2 rotating flavors a day for frozen ones and she brought both out in a sample glass for me to try!

Overall, the experience here did not stand out and I found it to be quite pricey for what we got. Not only was the food mediocre but the portions were tiny. Perhaps the tacos should be recommended as an appetizer instead? Our food also came out almost immediately, which made me question how fresh prepared this place really is. Based on my skirt steak, I wonder if it was just sitting out on the counter all day.

The Mission is a gorgeous, dimly lit restaurant with chandeliers all over. It's beautiful, relaxing and definitely quiet enough where you can enjoy conversation. The crowd was just as stunning as any you'd see in an Old Town nightclub, too.

Besides the tasty mezcal I tried (lick some Tabasco off your hand before you sip it--trust me, it's great), I also loved The Mission's sangria, which was super-sweet.

There were not that many vegetarian options. I started off with a bowl of the gazpacho, which was chunk-free and had the perfect amount of spice to it. If you've never had the cold soup before, I highly recommend it here.

For dinner, I got the corn gorditas, which is normally an appetizer and definitely was not filling enough for a meal. The mini-corn tortillas were topped with veggies, and while tasty, the portion was meager. Next time, I'll try the veggie tacos.

The place looks nice, there's no denying it. There's an obvious theme going on, low-light interior with candles on every surface, around a dozen and a half ornate chandeliers, crosses on the back wall to tie in with the actual Spanish Mission. It's going for dark & solemn, and it hits the mark, so kudos for that.

The food, though...I mean, I suppose my group and I should have been prepared for pretentious presentation and ridiculously small portions, given that this is Scottsdale, but seriously, when the food came out, we looked at each other, had a bit of a moment, all clearly baffled by how little we each had on our plates. It tasted alright, and was artfully plated, but still, far too small.

And it wasn't only the portions; part of the problem, at least for me personally, was what they tried to pass off as a salad. It was maybe five slivers of onion, a few itty bitty greens, and half a dozen extremely thin-sliced tomatillas. This was all sprinkled over my flat iron steak and repeatedly referred to by the waitress as a salad. It was not a salad. It was a garnish that they tried to talk up as a very fancy salad so they could justify charging $30 for the meal.

My group and I will not be returning. We're happy to visit our usual Mexican restaurant haunts. But hey, in an attempt to end on a happy note, I'd like to mention that the service was awesome.

The Mission specializes in serving what they describe as a modern take on Latin cuisine, throwing in multiple South American influences that are guaranteed to make for an interesting experience. Yelp ratings are fairly high - and given that they're one of the few restaurants in Phoenix in the ultra-rare ""1000-plus review"" club, our expectations were very high going in.

We booked a reservation for a late-afternoon\/early evening Saturday about a week in advance. While walking through the restaurant, the front patio (with fireplace) and restaurant interior appear to give off a lovely ambiance. Unfortunately, we were relegated to the back-patio awning during a particularly nasty rainfall. It was basically just a bunch of tables mashed together and didn't really offer much in terms of style or vibe. I felt like I was at one of those church potlucks that my Mom would always force me to attend as a child.

Anyway, we decided to start with their tableside guacamole. We were able to request the ""mild"" version to avoid any unexpected spice issues. Honestly, we were both very impressed with its complex flavor, ranking it right up with some of the best guacamole we've ever had in Phoenix. The best? Not quite - but pretty damned close! Clearly they've got their guac preparation down to a science. Additionally, we ordered the street corn (off the cob). All ingredients, including the mild inclusion of butter, chila paprika, aji rocoto, cilantro, and cotij were all extremely well balanced, with nothing overpowering the dish as a whole. 

On a side note, do you know the one thing that drives me absolutely crazy about some of these restaurants? When they bring out everything you've ordered at the same damned time! Starters are called starters for a reason, you know? When you bring out the starters, don't bring out the main entrees literally minutes later, people! We considered saying something, but decided not to, for fear that they'd just stick our taco plates under a heat lamp for thirty minutes while we finished the guac and corn. Bloody hell!

With that rant aside, we ordered two taco plates, consisting of the short rib barbacoa and skirt steak (3 tacos per plate). Being forced to push the guac and corn off to the side, we both agreed that the barbacoa was decent. However, it was the skirt steak which really blew us away, having a lovely smokey and complex flavor that easily destroys most (if not all) carne asada tacos we've tried in Phoenix. How they make them this good? I'm not entirely sure, but this is exactly how they should always be done. No questions asked.

We also ordered a side of papas y chorizo, which is basically self-explanatory. They were fine, although probably not necessary with all of the food we ordered.

For dessert, we chose the espresso churros - although I'm not entirely sure how espresso comes into play here. The miniature sized churros were good, although if espresso was somehow infused into them, it was difficult to detect. The dish also came with a cinnamon-flavored milkshake that was similar to a thickened horchata. We both enjoyed it, but not to the point where we'd order it again.

Overall, I'd rate the experience as four stars. Servers were all very polite, although it was a bit weird that multiple people would attempt to take our order, despite us already having placed it. We're not really sure who our primary server was throughout the evening. Rushing all the food out at once didn't really ruin the experience, but it definitely threw off our usual dining pace.

In the end, I was fully expecting a triple digit bill, but was pleasantly surprised to discover that our end-price was really no different than what we'd pay at any moderately-priced restaurant. I'm sure if you drink alcohol, this would change pretty quickly.

Aside from some of the quirks I mentioned, we'd definitely return - although I'm more interested in trying their new Kierland location in the near future.

Bottom line: Make a reservation and ensure that you're guaranteed a spot either indoors or on the front patio. Don't make things too convenient for the servers by ordering everything at once, but take your time making your choices in order to savor every dish they bring to your table.

Minor complaints aside, based solely on their guacamole and skirt steak tacos, I just can't resist giving them a strong recommendation!",2,0,0

Started with Blood Orange margaritas.... my friend ordered mine frozen, prefer the rocks much more.  More flavor, less brain freeze...

Could drown in a bowl of the table-side Guac.  As others have stated before, perfect combination, spicy without compromising flavor.

Had the lamb appetizer, tender, juicy, and delicious, and after devouring a ton of chips was enough to fill me up, but my hubby had the diver scallops, and was still hungry... tastes great, less filling.

Our friends RAVED about the chicken dinner, personally I can't order chicken when I go out to eat.  No matter how good it may be, I feel like I should eat something more exotic.

Will that be enough time for you?""  I was stunned because nobody has ever asked how long my dinner is going to take, especially when we make a reservation.

So, we showed up last night with a little bit of a chip on our shoulder about what the dining experience would be like.

It turns out that the entire evening was fantastic.  Our server, Rachel, was spectacular.  She took the time to go over the entire menu since we had never been there before.  She answered all of our questions about the dishes and made some wonderful suggestions.  Everything that we ordered was top notch!

The guacamole was probably some of the best that we have ever had.  The tostada was fantastic along with the crispy pork served in the lettuce (will definitely get that again).  The steak tacos were delicious as well.

Definitely get the street corn, it is out of this world!

What does this mean? Expect the unexpected. If you don't have the cojones to try something new, this may not be the place for you. Tip! - if you're not sure about something on the menu, ask plenty of questions, more on that later. 

Despite arriving 10 minutes prior to my reserved time we were quickly seated and our server came right over to take our drink order. The house margarita's were good enough to make me vow to never again drink a margarita made from that premixed high fructose crap. I have officially kicked that habit. 

The first course was a Peruvian clam stew, otherwise known as ""Almejas Al Vapor"". Incredible! Imagine the best soup de poisson you've ever had now add that to the best posole you've ever had and turn all that into a thick, creamy stew and voila! - you've got yourself one amazing dish. A perfect amount of spiciness, yet you don't even realize it because of all the other amazing flavors lurking within. 

Second course was the chorizo porchetta with white bean puree. Basically, a very tender braised pork shoulder wrapped around a small piece of Mexican sausage. This dish was very good but not great, and I blame myself. The meat had a fairly strong smoky flavor which I personally don't care for. This might be due to the mesquite fired Plancha grill that I'm just not used to. However, I can see how others with an alternative palate would adore this dish. Again, this was my fault, I should have asked the server ""what does it taste like"" before ordering. 

For desert I had the espresso churros with ibarra chocolate milkshake. The milkshake was great, the churros on the other hand were a bit overcooked, dare I say... charred. A good churro is crispy on the outside and soft and chewy in the center. Granted, this will be very difficult for The Mission because their churros are very thin. For a churro of this size, there's probably a fine line between a limp piece of greasy dough or a brittle, black stick of coal. 

After dinner the server brought each of us a shot of tequila. A nice gesture as she knew that it was a going away meal for my dinner companion who is moving to Texas.

The margaritas are really good.  I had the primarita, which the server recommended as it is the most popular.  It was really good.  The boyfriend ordered a smokehouse margarita, which definitely pulled through with it's name.  It had a smokey flavor and a spicy kick.

We started out with the grilled street corn, which came with a mayo-based sauce that was incredibly flavorful, and a little spicier than I expected, but in a good way.  I ordered the short ribs, and the boyfriend ordered the chorizo porchetta.  Both were very flavorful.  I really enjoyed the cheese sauce that came with the meat.

The ambiance and decor were perfect. I read reviews stating that it was too dark, but it was never too dark for me to read or see what I was eating.  Our server was very friendly and our glasses were always filled.

We were seated at a spot in the back near the vines which was awkward. One of our party of four repeatedly got her hair stuck in said vines and another person (with a small build) had to ask another table if she could pull out her chair because it was so close to ours. It was very busy but never had to wait for a seat. There is a free parking lot across the street, which is very convenient. 

Service both times was friendly and efficient. Specific people dedicated to drink and chip refills and bussing empty plates. Table side guac is amazing and you pick your spice level and can omit certain ingredients (onion for us). The street corn is so freaking tasty with an unexpected kick. We got it cut off the cob, which made it easy to share. Big, individual bowls of salsa and complimentary warm chips are doled out. Yummy but spicy. Brings a tissue! :-)

The street tacos are small but wonderful. We ordered different tacos and shared and they wee all so delicious. My favorite is definitely the rock shrimp but you can't really go wrong. Hubby got the pork tacos today and really liked them. The pork was super tender and flavorful (BBQ flavorings). The chipotle grits he ordered were okay but mostly a miss. Greasy and overly spicy, thus we wouldn't order again. The biggest disappointment today was the kids chicken quesadilla we ordered for our toddler. It was $11, typical quesadilla, with no sides or drink included(although they brought him a foam, enclosed cup of water with no prompting). So pricey for hardly any cheese and a few huge chunks of chicken. No other meal options for kids.

But, it was my boyfriends 21st birthday, and he'd been talking about going here for a while. Knowing that they had a pretty good drink selection, I decided to take him.

The place is smack in the middle of Downtown\/Old Town Scottsdale, so be sure to arrive a bit early and be able to walk a little ways, because they don't have their own private lot (it's all street parking). Anyhow, the outside is very plain and simple- like an actual Spanish missionary-type building. Despite the simplicity to the exterior, the interior is so much more lavish. So much up-scale decor and style, I was blow away! 

Anyhow, we sat down and had the most pleasant and nice waitress that we've had in a while at any dining experience. She had short blonde hair and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and seemed to genuinely care. She took our drink orders and was so nice about it being my boyfriends birthday! After checking ID, she brought us the blood orange margarita and the watermelon mojito. According to the boyfriend, both drinks were really good and really strong-- I guess that's a good thing considering the drinks are pretty pricey- $12-14 a piece. 

Anyhow, when she came back we ordered the tableside guacamole to start. Awesome concept, you get you add in exactly what you want, you get to determine how spicy you want it (we got the hot version) and you get to watch it being made! Aside from the interesting concept, the guacamole itself was SO good. I really haven't had fresh guac like that ever. The only downside is that the portion is a tad small for $12. 

Our waitress came back in a timely fashion, and took the time to explain the menu in detail to us. We ended up ordering the barbacoa tacos and the crispy rock shrimp tacos. The wait for the food was short, and when they came out I was amazed. I have NEVER, EVER, EVER eaten a taco that mind-bogglingly delicious. How it works for the tacos is you get three tiny little housemade tortillas that come with heaps of meat or shrimp or whatever you decide on top- kind of like an open-faced sandwich concept. Anyhow, the rock shrimp were my favorite. The shrimp were cooked to crispy perfection, but not overly-battered. The shrimp tasted fresh and juicy, and the cabbage and such that came with it was delicious as well. Make sure to squeeze some fresh lime on top for an extra kick! My boyfriend ordered the barbacoa tacos, and they were honestly amazing as well. I've really never eaten meat that tender in my life. It was super flavorful and melt in your mouth delicious! 

Once we finished, we waited a bit for our plates to get cleared, but to our surprise our waitress brought us a sparkler with a complimentary dessert for my boyfriends birthday. The dessert was a warm pumpkin bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream, and gosh was it delicious. I would most definitely recommend it. The service got pretty slow toward the end of our meal, but honestly it didn't really deter too much from the great food. 

The bill came- around $80, but I was so willing to pay the price for a great meal and good service (FINALLY)! Would most definitely recommend to anyone looking to try something out of the box!",0,0,0

the place is not a place for enjoying your meal. it is a fusion of mexican argentine and peruvian food. in which the food part is pretty good. just don't order any Taco (they are badly made and not sure why)
the waitress was very nice and describe the food well, she did not recommended the Taco, next time I would try the short ribs or their speciality pork belly.
I wish they lit up the room a bit, too dark and having a waitress to shine a light on the menu or your food so you can see, doesn't help.

Our decision start with the Avocado Margarita and the Cucumber Jalapeno Margarita was a nice way to begin lunch!  The waiter described the Avocado Margarita as a smoothy but I found it more like a thick margarita.  Wonderful!

We had the table side traditional guacamole.  Very flavorful and quite enjoyable.

Whenever I see Pozole soup on the menu, I jump on it.  Their version was very unique.  Large chunks of smoky pork was a real surprise with a more broth base than I have had elsewhere.  A unique presentation and I will remember it!

We split the Shrimp Anticuchos and the Short rib tacos.  Both were excellent.   Enough for 2 people to share.

We gave it the benefit of the doubt since it was new and needed to work out its problems. Deciding to return, we reserved a table for six at the restaurant through Open Table and arrive on time. We were asked to wait in a room the size of a coat closet next to the men and women's bathroom for forty minutes. While waiting we ordered drinks. The bar mixed a Martini dirty rather than dry with no attempt to correct the mistake. No complimentary chips or dips while waiting. Finally seated, a shoe leather tough steak fillet arrived after ordering it medium rare. An order of Mahi Mahi fish tacos was served as advertised battered instead of pan seared straying from the traditional. 
   The over used South American inspired menu is weak and should be reworked from the ground up. A theme past its prime. I will take a star away for poor management regarding the reservation screw-up since we are certain Open Table take their reservation application seriously. Take away another star for the uneven service and subtract a star for poor food preparation. One less star for general neglect. I will however give the restaurant one star for the lively bar scene which obviously keeps the doors open.

Most times I'm not impressed because... See review for all the other Mexican places I have ventured but other times it's a great experience and treat. 

Meantime I decided to go out with my team and we looked forward to this awesome atmosphere and restaurant located in old town Snobsdale. We made reservations and ended up with Lauren our server for the night.  We ordered appetizers like the Guacamole and the cheese plate.  The guacamole was good but nothing beyond what other local joints can do and I was not impressed with the portion which was very small. The cheese plate was not my favorite.

We kept getting pushed to hurry and order and we were still having cocktails and waiting for another member. The server said if there was any chance we can call our friend to order her food because they needed to serve more guest?? What the French! Did we just get checked at a high end restaurant and were told to hurry up?! 

By the time we got our food I was really annoyed.  Here I am bringing out my team and although I understand you have a busy place, get over yourself and make sure your hostess doesn't seat us if we don't have a party versus making such a classless move.  Foul!

The food was okay but my experience just bummed me out.  I talked to the manager, Brian and he said it was a tough balance and hoped we can understand.  We will see whether I would ever do this again.  It's not like I do this every once in a while, I'm out and about all the time.  Boo",2,0,0

Service has to be flawless, food has to be top notch, and the entire experience needs me to be thinking about it days later. That's what I experienced at The Mission. Broken Plate Concepts truly gets that dining out isn't just dining out--it should be an experience from start to finish. 

Like it's sister restaurant, House Brasserie, the restaurant is lovely.  And it's meant to be a finer dining experience so take the time to dress up. A party ahead of us who clearly hadn't planned out their experience was informed that the young men needed to remove their baseball caps. They weren't happy about it, but I appreciate that a restaurant wants to maintain a certain level of experience for everyone.  There are 2 patios, one in front and one in rear of restaurant. Both were comfortable and calming. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and worked very hard to make our first experience memorable. We were celebrating our anniversary and she even treated us to dessert. Classy!

So, if you're coming to The Mission, you have to have the table side guacamole. It's a must have. You can have other stuff off the starters list but if you don't get the table side guacamole, you are a fool. Seriously. It's that good. They roll out a cart filled with every ingredient imaginable to create guac and literally make guacamole right at your table to your taste. It doesn't get any fresher or better than that. The chips are warm, not too salty and more importantly, sturdy! There is nothing worse than flimsy chips that break when you are scooping salsa and\/or guacamole. And let me tell you, the salsa is incredible. 

Husband and I both had the street tacos; he the tecate skirt steak tacos and I the roasted butternut squash tacos. Y.U.M. We went on Saturday evening...it's now Tuesday. We are STILL talking about these tacos. The skirt steak was melt in your mouth tender and the butternut squash tacos were filling and perfectly done. Nothing worse than overcooked squash. We also had the papas y chorizo and the chipotle grits for sides. Both were delicious and unique. 

Our dessert was a pumpkin bread pudding that was damn near a religious experience. Ordinarily I wouldn't pick bread pudding but I am going to have to rethink that after having this ooey, gooey, chunk of heaven. The ice cream sprinkled with cayenne was a nice touch too.

I had the Mahi Mahi tacos. Yes, they're tiny but the quality was high and the flavors were a unique blend that worked very well. My husband had the tecate skirt steak tacos. The steak was very tender and flavorful. We would both order them again. 

We both had water with our meal because it was hot and we felt dehydrated. As expected the water tasted fresh instead of the usual AZ ""I just licked a rock"" water that many restaurants serve. As we were paying, they were giving out their house blueberry lemonade alcoholic drink for free. I had one. Again, drinks are small and the flavor was fresh.   

The bill for quac, water and 2 taco platters was about $50. I mention this not because I was surprised but because other reviewers expressed shock. We were both impressed enough with the flavor and quality of our small plates that we agreed we would come back for dinner some time, recognizing we will probably drop $100 on entrees alone, and double that if we have appetizers and dessert. As mentioned above, the service was excellent - prompt, frequent and friendly",4,0,1

The Bar: What a lovely, refreshing Basil margarita!  It was just sweet enough without being syrupy.  But bartender, why is getting a recommendation out of you like pulling teeth?

The Food: Excellent table-side guacamole; it lived up to the very high expectations set by all the other reviewers.  My dinner partner's Hangar Steak was very juicy for such a thin cut and the dressing from the tomatillo salad give the whole dish a tangy, acidic bite.  My Chorizo Porchetta was very unique and flavorful, but a little more sauce would've saved it from being slightly dry.  I love though how the star of the entrees really is the meat here, the portions were generous and the sides were an accompaniment, not a competitor.
***Almost forgot about the pumpkin bread pudding we shared!  He loved the scotch-carmel sauce which I thought was too sweet.  I loved the moist, fragrant bread which he thought was missing pumpkin-y spice.  To each their own!

The Atmosphere:  It's a gothic romance come to life with beautiful dark metal chandeliers, warm, glowing salt bricks, and dim lighting.  I just wish the table of 6 old men talking golf wasn't sooo close.  A little more room between tables would complete the intimate decor.

The Service:  I have no complaints here!  Our server was excellent and never overwhelming, the lady who made our guac was all charm, and kudos to the chef who sent us complimentary street corn (yummy by the way).  

A note on the street corn: I felt like this was a dish that would've won the Top Chef competition where they had to re-invent convenience store food.  The grilled, slightly salty & crunchy corn topped with creamy spicy cheese sauce beats any AM-PM nachos I've ever had! :)

Jennifer came over to the table and screamed at us that's why I didn't want a chair there. But she had told my husband to sit there. And had brought him a chair. Instead of apologizing (which is what a normal person would do) she came over guns blazing and treats us like it's our fault?!

(My wife and I generally find ourselves there at least once a month--it's our favorite spot in town).  But since I hadn't been in a while, I forgot how great it is.

Ambiance: Couldn't get any better.  Candlelit and romantic.  Music is always hip--tends to get pretty loud on the weekends. 

Service: We've had probably 5 or 6 different servers.  They are always friendly and full of knowledge about the menu, and great at making recommendations. 

Food: Amazing.  I had the green chile duck this time.  One of my new favorites.  My wife always gets the peruvian stew and the black cod.  Perfect. (We never skip out on dessert.  The pumpkin bread pudding is to die for.)

Drinks: Eclectic wine selection--mostly stuff I don't know about, but we had south american pinot noir that was delicious.  Also, take a look at the tequila flights! (if you dare...) The margaritas are supposed to be the specialty here...Love the blood orange and their ""skinny"".  Did NOT love the ginger and spice one...

Experience: My only issue is that the meal tends to be distracting, as the tables are quite close together, and there is ALWAYS hustle and bustle in this place, so I wouldn't necessarily use it for important nights (i.e. proposals or something).

I had heard good things about The Mission from many Scottdalers prior so I figured it would be a nice play for a special occasion dinner and I was not disappointed in the slightest. This place is fantastic. 
 
The first thing that strikes you is the atmosphere. It's cool. I am trying to think of a better adjective but cool sums it up perfectly. The place is dimly lit and decorated to give this chilled out laid back vibe, and the staff make you feel like you have been dining there for years. The building actually used to be a church so it has this really unique setting that totally works. Try to picture a church that was converted into a saloon that has been given a major upgrade in style. 
 
Now the restaurant was pretty full when we arrived and we had not made a reservation so we sat at the bar while awaiting our table. We enjoyed a round of simple yet delicious margaritas and snacked on some chips and guacamole that was made fresh right in front of us. The wait was not too long, about 20 minutes, so I wouldn't say that a reservation is important but I can imagine on a weekend it may be much busier. 
 
The service was excellent from the moment we stepped into the restaurant. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who promptly pulled together some bar stools for us and found a server to start us with some refreshments. Our server, who's name I am afraid I have forgotten, was great. She was very personable and made us feel right at home. She recommended a dew dishes which we tried and loved and she regularly checked up on us to see if we needed anything else. 
 
The food was great though on the pricier side. We tried the Duck Carnitas Empanada (my favorite), Chorizo Porchetta, Green Chile Duck Confit, and the Chilean Salmon. Each dish was delicious and the portions were enough to ensure satisfaction. The prices are on the higher side, roughly $30 per main course, but I feel like the value for money is definitely there and I didn't wince when the bill came along. I strongly recommend the duck empanada as well; it was so delicious we ended up ordering an extra one after already finishing an order. 
 
This is definitely a place that suits the adult crowd better than the family crowd as a dining destination. This is a great place for to bring a date in my opinion. The atmosphere is great and would work well with a romantic setting plus the food and drinks will help make a great distraction if things aren't going great. After work drinks would be great here as well as well. If you like Mexican food or just good food in general then you must check this place out.",1,1,1

Server obviously can not handle the size of her section plus a large party. We were charged for multiple thing we did not order and charged twice for other items. When we brought this to her attention instead of saying she would fix it she immediately stated, ""It was our fault."" When the manager approached he was not helpful or apologetic. He stated we ordered additional items from a busboy,(which did not happen). The busboy asked if we ordered four? I very clearly stated not four, only two. When I asked why there were four? I was told they split them into four so everyone could have some. we were then charged for five and when we brought this up, the manager said,""[He] would take care of two of them for us."" in a condescending manner as if we had ordered them but did not want to pay for it. That still left one we did not order. Drinks took way to long to come to the table(30 mins) and were the wrong drinks twice, but we drank them anyway because we didn't want to wait longer. The wrong appetizer was also brought out, and when we told the waitress this she said,"" No, that's the one I recommended."" we then explained that we know she recommended that one, but we said we wanted the pork belly not the cola glazed pork. She was then rude again and said that's not what we ordered. She then very rudely said we might as well keep it because she was just going to throw it out anyway we refused twice then finally said fine leave it. She never brought out the right appetizer by the way. Drinks were also charged out for $2 more per drink than the menu price indicates. When a party is spending over $600 for dinner and a mistake is made it should be fixed instead of placing blame on the guests. Spending money was never the issue.  I understand the waitress wanted to up sell in order to get a larger gratuity, but had she listened and did a better job of taking care of the table we would have spent $100's more on drinks (like we did across the street after we left). It was also odd that the gratuity that was added was not a consistent percent for each check. We all understood there would be an added gratuity for a large party, but shouldn't it be the same percent per check? We were also told when we sat down that she could not do separate checks and there would be two checks at the end which we said would be fine. Then when she tried to make separate checks (which we had already said we didn't need) she told us it was our fault because we changed seats. My reply was you told us we could not have separate checks so we did not assume we had to stay in the same seat, we all stayed at our same table so it should not have made a difference. I have eaten here multiple times and never have I had such a bad experience. If you can not handle large parties you should be up front with your guests, and we would not have made the reservation. There are many options in the area that I know can handle it. I have recommended your restaurant on a daily basis to many of my patients who live in the area. I will no longer be doing so. I accept that mistakes can be made, but may I suggest, in the future instead of having an attitude and being condescending, simply apologize and correct the mistake. I felt so bad for inviting my friends here for my birthday, that I actually refunded their money to them out of my own pocket.

That is fair, I can understand keeping the premium sitting open for larger parties or people certain to order entrees. So we took at seat at the bar. The place looked really nice and I was impressed by the selection of premium booze behind the bar.  Unfortunately we never got a chance to experience The Mission. After sitting at the bar for somewhere between 5 and 10 Mins we were yet to be acknowledged.  All the while staff is busy swirling around us. So when we decided that the Mission did not want our patronage, we got up and left after never being spoken too.

We went on a Sunday early afternoon for brunch.  It was busy but we were able to find a table in the bar area (first come, first served).  Otherwise, if you want a table, I'd suggest making reservations (we had one for dinner originally and times went quickly...we called a week in advance and the best we could get was 6PM).

Brunch is a choice of the regular menu, which is small but has some good dishes, or an All-You-Can-Eat taco bar, which is done well.  They have someone carving beef and pork.  They put it on a small, soft tortilla for you, and you add your own toppings.  Very good, reasonable price (think it was $16).  They also offer table side Guacamole, made to your preferences.

Overall, very enjoyable.  Might give it a 5-star if it were in another location, but with the competition in that area, there are a few that are slightly better.",0,0,0

The decor of this place is beautiful! It is so cool and so hip! I loved it but keep it mind it is pretty dark. There is a great little patio in the front of the restaurant, a bar with some seating available, and a small to medium sized main dining room. 

The restaurant week menu was very enticing and I was immediately drawn to the Ahi Tuna appetizer, halibut entree, and churro expresso dessert. Unfortunately, they were out of the Tuna (which our server did not tell us until we were all ready to order. I ended up getting the pork belly salad which was yummy but we were a little annoyed we were not told up front that the restaurant week menu was limited. But no big deal, not the end of the world. We all ordered and were enjoying our cocktails when the waiter came back and said the kitchen only had two halibuts left and three of us had ordered it. It was disheartening to change my order yet again. I ended up ordering the filet. To be fair, it was amazing. Whatever they put in it rub seasoning was fantastic! I just had my heart set on the tuna and the halibut. (I have been studying the menu on-line days in advance!) The three desserts: expresso churro, fried bananas, and pumpkin bread pudding were all OK, nothing spectacular. We did get a free mini margarita with our meal but I am pretty sure there was no alcohol in it. 

The staff was very polite and the place was packed. It was overall a great time but I have to go with 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 because I was forced to order things that I was not intending on having. They should be pretty stocked up considering how popular restaurant week is. Additionally, if they were out of something, it would have been nice if they could have offered an alternative third app. 

I would go back because it was a great location, nice staff, cool place, and really good steak!",1,1,1

When you arrive at The Mission you enter into what looks like a very nice restaurant with attractive decor, comfortable seats and a quiet, refined atmosphere.  But you get your first of three disappointments when the menu comes.  There are very few options -- six varieties of street taco, four tortas, a hot dog, and roasted chicken.  There are a number of sides and starters; perhaps you should make a meal of these??  

The second disappointment is the portion size.  The guacamole, advertised by our server as ""for the table"" is about one small avocado's worth.  The tacos are tiny - a single byte of filling in each of three.  The sides are not much bigger.

The third disappointment is the price.  $12 for the guacamole, $10 for the three bytes of taco, $6 for a small portion of fries?  Really?  Mission, you are nowhere near that good.",5,1,0

This food is great and seeing as we don't have the best Mexican food where I'm at this was perfect.  There was quite a few of us that were here - total of about 8 people and we were seated quickly.  I heard this place is really popular so calling ahead is suggested.  I started off with the drink menu and I got a variety of drinks, honestly, I forgot what I drank prior to the tequila that we got.  Anyways, I was told that I had to get the guac both spicy and mild so we ordered them both.  The spicey had a nice kick to it and it was delicious.  It was so good that I was craving for more.  It was a little insane to have such a guac crave after lots of drinks but it was the best guac I've had thus far.  We ordered so many appetizers I think we cleared the entire menu and then went straight for the tacos.  There were so many of us that we just ordered a variety of tacos and they were amazing.  At the end we were so stuffed I wasn't sure i would be able to go out dancing again but needless to say the Mission hit the spot!  You can't miss this if you're in town.

My husbands Flat Iron steak was very good, my Chicken Anticuchos was not.  The chicken was very, very dry and barely able to cut through it with the knife I was given.  I had to saw through it and pull it apart with the knife and fork to get small enough pieces to eat. The flavor was OK and the rice mole and mushrooms were good.  It is unfortunate that most restaurants in Scottsdale do not know how to cook chicken so that it is moist and tender. 
I see many reviews that say ""under $30 dollars""  I don't know what menu they are looking at but $30. dollars is the starting price of any dish and it goes way up from there!

Guys, there is only one reason to go to the mission, and it's to take your lover there and show her that you are a man of distinguished tastes and also that you have slightly too much money, but not too much that you're frivolous - just enough extra that you can afford things like expensive tiny tacos and fancy drinks.

When you go to the mission, maybe it's best to eat inside, because the lights are low, and the wood is dark, and it's moody - do you understand what I'm saying?  It's a romantic atmosphere.  So first get some drinks, and I recommend their margaritas, or their tequila mojito, but if you're a guy only order the tequila mojito if your lady already knows that you are a strong lover, because you don't want to send the wrong message, but it's an amazing drink.

Next, it's time for the tacos.  Their menu is pretty thick but it's mostly the cover that's thick, and there aren't actually a lot of pages, so focus on the tacos.  They're sold three at a time, so your will order three tiny tacos, and your lover will order three tiny tacos as well, and then maybe once the food comes, you have an opportunity to swap one.  Or maybe two.  Do you see what I'm saying?

Finally, desert.  Hey, get another drink and get some fried bananas - that's both a suggestive dish, and something delicious, and it lets you both set the mood for what happens after dinner.

That's it.  If you don't like the food or drinks, you don't know what good is, and if you haven't set the mood right, then you have nobody to blame but yourself (or maybe you need to be more discerning about your choice of lovers).  The Mission.",1,7,3

I had been hatching ""my mission"" to visit The Mission for quite some time. It began after sampling their Peruvian Clam Stew at a Yelp party. Though it was a mere shot glass of a sampler, I was hooked. The mixture of spicy chorizo, briny clam goodness, and sweet coconut milk forever lingered on my palate only to tattoo my brain with a flavor memory that could not be satiated. Until now.

My dining compadre and I started with the tableside guacamole. It is the perfect balance of everything good that should go into guac. My server almost forgot to top it with toasted pepinos, but I mentioned this and got my dose. We moved to the Peruvian clam stew, but had them split the order in half so we could each sample it... and save room for a meaty entrée. It was everything I had dreamed about and longed for 'lo these many years. Another nice touch is the sweet corn niblets that were sprinkled throughout the dish, providing a burst of sweetness to the rich complexity of the chorizo and clam broth.

Our entrée was equally fantastic. Slow-cooked pork shoulder tacos. The handmade mini tortillas are presented on a heated salt rock! A generous hunk of fork-tender pork shoulder plus grated cotija cheese, diced red onion and fresh cilantro comprise this build-your-own street tacos ensemble. It really is a generous portion that feeds two, as claimed on the menu.

I might have let it slip to our tableside guacamole preparer that it was my birthday. Our waiter picked up on that and brought over a complimentary dessert that was the coup de grâce. Warm bread pudding in a salted caramel sauce with a scoop of dulce de leche ice cream... Decadent without being overly sweet. This dessert again demonstrates the deftness with which The Mission balances flavors and textures. Pumpkin seeds provided some crunch and pomegranate gems gave just enough of a contrasting pop of tartness amidst the sea of delicately sweet caramel sauce.

Needless to say, I had a fabulous birthday, due in no small part to the otherworldly meal I had at The Mission. I will continue to dream about this food until the next time I am summoned. And then... should I choose to accept it... I will embark upon another holy mission in search of deliciousness...",6,2,2

Last night my dining experience was sub par. The server waited on the two tables next to us but we were there at least 15 minutes prior to those guests arriving. 

Before I go on to set the stage, I am a parent and understand the challenges when attempting to bring a baby to a place to dine. 

I usually get seated in the same table that I am always seated at, the tables are pretty close together so sometimes folks can bump your table spilling drinks. This happened twice last night. It happens, no big deal. The problem last night was that there was a family at the front of the place. This family had a infant that had a ear piercing scream and the child screamed a lot, so much so that everyone around was just staring at each other. Again, I understand the challenges of having a child but it is up to the staff at The Mission to make sure that the environment for the guests is enjoyable. Clearly this was not the case from 9:15 to 10:00 last night as many folks finished their meals as quick as possible to get out as did myself and my date.

I will say that I loved the guacamole but wouldn't have dined there just for that. The Barrio Cafe also has fabulous table side guacamole. We split a bottle of wine and a salad to start. The salad was supposed to have cantaloupe in it. We were half way through when we realized we were missing melon. We had a very dismissive server named Sam who insisted there was cantaloupe in it but didn't know if it was diced or in the garnish sauce. We asked him to check and he seemed put out. Returned and claimed we should have been able to see it. He asked what we wanted to do about it. Should he bring more..we agreed that he could bring 1\/2 a salad...which he did with tons of cantaloupe on it..and then he stopped by to make sure we found the cantaloupe! He disappeared after that and we never saw him again until he brought the bill. The menu is very limited at lunch. If you aren't into tacos or tortas don't bother! Our server was unpleasant..the tacos that followed the salad ok but not as good as some local family run spots. The best part of the afternoon was the company of a good friend who made the experience fun despite the lackluster, over priced food!",1,1,1

She then said, she would talk to the chef and see if she can get the fee waived. The general manager heard, and came storming up rudely and said, You brought food into my restaurant. That's why we charge you the 3.00 fee, and continue to talk down to us, as if we had brought in our own meal to the restaurant.  He said every restaurant charges that, which is not true. I have been to many locations, with large parties, where own cakes\/ cupcakes have been brought in, and never been treated so rudely.

There was the ambiance....
The ambiance here envelopes you, much like that first wave of warmth you get from a vicodin, scotch and Red Bull blast. In fact, this place is so warm and cozy, it'll make you feel like you're back in the womb flipping off the ultrasound technician.

The service...
Perched at their communal high top, a long and double-sided table adjacent to the bar, our server was more attentive than a lion tamer with a big stick. This made it an absolute certainty I would lose the first of my five senses in a very short period...hearing.
The weird thing about those communal tables is how you never know who you're going   to sit next to. Who do I get?
A gaggle of what I can only conjecture were church ladies whom, at my merely uttering (90 decibels) the word 'FUCK', would violently, and in unison, snap their heads in my direction. Now this was fun.
Yes, my prodigious cursing made for quite the theatrics as, with the same precision of Old Faithful, five heads would whip about on cue giving me the skunk-eye.
What a hoot.

The Food....
The food was, well, I'm not sure. It looked and smelled good, but I was down to three senses by the time we finally ordered. Sadly, taste, much like Elvis, had left the building at that point. Good thing for our dates who were quick to inform us (routinely droning on throughout the meal) about how delicious everything was. (Blah Blah Blah)

The bill for four of us came to two hundred twelve dollars before tip. We had drinks, some very cool looking appetizers, enough chips and salsa to feed a small Ethiopian village, a bevy of drink, and some entrees whose names I couldn't remember if my life depended on it.

As I said, pre-gaming at the Mission was the best decision we made all night. 
Who could ever know that with one well-timed (and perhaps highly audible) ""FUCK"", I held the awesome power to control my very own Women's Synchronized Scowling Team.
For at least one night of my miserable existence, I WAS omnipotent.

Thanks Mission.",0,7,4

The Mission would be a great place for date night; it's upscale without being pretentious, and the low-lighting, candles, and chandeliers provide a nice, sexy atmosphere. 

We started with the tableside guacamole, which was incredible! Flavorful and creamy, with a great smoky heat from the chipotle. Hands down beats all the other guacamole I've had in town - including Barrio Cafe's - and I'm quite the guac snob because I make a mean version of it myself. The drinks were great too, we just had a couple rounds of house margaritas which were refreshing and on the strong side, but I'm looking forward to trying other margaritas from their extensive drink menu upon my return. 

The staff was friendly, prompt, attractive, unobtrusive - pretty much everything I look for in servers. Service was a tad on the slow side, but that didn't bother me because I was enjoying the food and company and it was a Friday night after all. 

I had the fish tacos which were crunchy and inventive, and also a relatively normal-sized portion. I know I'm in the minority in our indulgent society, but I appreciate it when a plate of food arrives that doesn't overwhelm\/disgust me with its sheer magnitude. One of my dinner companions had a pork dish and said it was the best cooked pork he'd had in a long time so I'm sure you can't go wrong with their pork dishes, either. 

I definitely recommend The Mission. It's not your traditional Mexican fare, but it's a great Latin American alternative when you're looking for something beyond your typical burrito, in a cozy, intimate environment.",1,0,1

We walked in here without a reservation for dinner on a trip to Scottsdale, and were promptly seated outside under a heat lamp.

This was an amazing quivering lump of perfectly cooked pork accompanied by a stack of fresh corn tortillas and fixings. The pork was so tender it could be flaked with a fork. We ate every bite. The side of black beans ranked among the best black beans I've ever eaten.

We liked the Mission so much, we returned for brunch the next morning. I had a bloody Mary, the steak tacos, and of course, a side of black beans. All excellent again, although the steak tacos weren't as memorable as that pork shoulder.

We ate outside both meals to take advantage of the beautiful weather, but inside seemed to have a very cool, trendy vibe. This seemed like a fun place to have cocktail hour with a group.

Their guacamole is phenomenal - fresh and made right in front of you to your taste. You really can't get any better without going to Mexico and eating at at a mom and pop restaurant.

The place was decorated beautifully and with southwestern class. Dress to impress here, but also don't fret if you're wearing shorts and a collared shirt; everyone is welcome here.

We began with table-side guacamole, which was prepared with ease and efficiency. Made with some heat to our liking; we finished it before our entrees. My girlfriend and I shared the pork shoulder tacos, which came highly recommended, with a habeñero pineapple sauce, and small dishes of chopped onions, shredded cheese, and cilantro to add to the mix. 

Handmade corn tortillas served on a hot Himalayan salt block, absolutely exquisite. 

The do-not-miss side dish we ordered was the Peruvian Street Corn, (offered on, or off-the-cob) which came with a lime wedge to squeeze over the top. Incredible complex flavors of sweet, tangy, and savory. We started adding it to our tacos and wow, we were blown away.

For dessert we shared the pumpkin bread pudding which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and served warm; a great way to end our meal.

I think the concept of the food is great, but not so great in execution.  The guacamole everyone raved about ""made tabelside"" was made over in a corner and brought over to the table already made.  I would have liked to watch them make it.  Was just about one large scoop and that was it.  Left us wanting more, but flacor wasn't really there.  Underseasoned and overpriced at $12.00.  And the chips were undercooked so crunchy onthe outside, but tought toward the middle.  The chicken skewers with mole sauce was dry and mole was just ok.  The sweet potatoe\/french fries were just like any other restaurants, but loved the sauces.  Tacos (ckicken) were just ok.  
The much acclaimed pumpkin bread pudding was excellent, but only about a 3 inch square.  Just a teaser size.

I think if you don't mind spending the money, can get by the snooty waitress, and want to try something different, go for it.  Everyone in the area said to try Los Olivos right around the corner for really good Mexican food.",1,0,0

My husband was getting over a cold and we needed to be careful about how we shared dishes, so we took the server up on her offer to have the corn served off the cob. That was probably the way to go with this dish as it was creamy, flavorful and super easy to share. There's no way anyone sane would pass this menu item up.

The duck empanadas were good -- the portion was massive for an appetizer item, so good value there. One of the sauces on the plate was too sweet but easily avoided in favor of the more preferred alternate sauce.

We also ordered the salmon entree that was an extremely appropriate serving size. Not ""tapas"" small but not generous enough to take home -- which we appreciate considering the ridiculous portioning Americans have become used to...

Lastly, the bread pudding was fantastic. The pepitas and pomegranate seeds gave just enough texture and acidity to round it out. So yum.

We came from chicago and finding Mexican food was top of our list of priorities as Its hard to find authentic Mexican out there. We decided on The Mission to celebrate his birthday based off extensive yelp searching and some recommendations from friends-- had a 730 reservation on a Saturday night. It was poppin (you definitely want a reservation). Ambiance was very lively. Room is dimly lit, making it great for a date (there was a first date going on at the table next to us), but there were plenty of groups eating together as well. 

Food breakdown:
-Started with the Skinny Margarita and Smokehouse Marg, both so good we ordered another round with dinner :)
-appetizers: tableside guac is my favorite and The Mission didn't disappoint! Sadly due to how crowded the restaurant was, she couldn't make it at our table but was a few tables away. It was delicious, however. Then we got the skewered corn but requested it off the cob, so we could dip the chips in it and mix with the guac-- highly recommend you do the same :) (warning, there was definitely a little kick to it)
-for the main course we got beer battered mahi mahi  and the barbacoa tacos. Both were great, but the mahi mahi were both of our favorites-- the breading was very light and the fish was fantastic
-Dessert: our waiter Arturo was amazing and brought us a complimentary pumpkin bread pudding dessert for the birthday celebrations. Holy. Cow. I do not normally eat dessert but this was one of the top five desserts I've ever had, and the birthday boy felt the same way. The pumpkin bread pudding is served warm with cold ice cream which balances the flavors, and there's a scotch caramel esque sauce and sunflower seeds and pomegranate on top. The flavors really mixed well and i was so sad when it was over

Then again to get the ice tea my friend ordered. I felt neglected. Then he took our guacamole before we finished eating it. She told me that she would serve the mahi ahi tacos to a five year old. I agree. Why beer batter a great fish like that? It tasted frozen or pre-packaged. From a restaurant that isn't a chain I was sorely disappointed. Let us be honest. The portions are great for skinny Scottsdale courtesans, however like most terrible Mexican places, I filled up on the chips.

We got the table side guacamole and it was spicy and wholesome. They make it to how you like, and that was pretty cool. We all got tacos... Pork shoulder, short rib, chicken and mahi. They come three to a plate and are 3 inches in size. They do fill you up so don't be alarmed. My short rib tacos were amazing and had so much flavor. The pork shoulder is for two, but of course my bro in law finished the entire chunk of meat they give you to make the tacos at the table.

i arrived before the other person that was joining me for dinner so i sat down at the bar for a drink.   they didn't have the first mexican beer that i asked for, it was apparently out of stock that day (no big deal), but when i did  order the bartender didn't give me a lime with my beer.   to serve a mexican beer without a lime should be a crime and every bartender should know that.   he did seem nice enough though.... just sayin...

the waitress came and handed us our menus and asked us what we wanted before we even had a chance to open them.   then she came back and started pushing entrees on us before we had a chance to ask about the appetizers.     the table service, like the bar, was nice enough, but did not seem very well trained in serving.

we had some corn gorditas as an app and they were tasty but slightly soggy. they tasted as if the tortilla had been prepaired hours before.

the pork shoulder for two was good though.   it was very simply garnished with 3 sides, and only a few small tortillas.  the portion was a little small as well but the flavor and tenderness made up for that.   the flavor of both the meat and the sauce were very good.

desert was ok.... nothing special.  some chocolate thing..

Sitting next to us a local was ordering and ran through the menu with us...he was so enthusiastic that we decided to get a few appetizers there....they were incredible.  My wife got an wonderful drink that paired with the house guacamole and the braised pork belly perfectly.  The fresh made chips were terrific, and the pork belly portion was bigger than most steaks I have had recently.  Topped with caramelized onions, perfectly spiced, just the right balance of crisp on top and unctuous in the middle.  The appetizers were so incredible we decided to keep going.  The ambience was wonderful, the crowd was sociable and we ordered the Peruvian clam stew, the duck confit and the sweet potato fries....oh, almost forgot the braised beef street tacos.  The portions were all huge, and it was clear that we had ordered too much, but we shared with the folks around us.  The street tacos were good, topped with a crisp slaw and fresh homemade bread and butter pickles.  I would say they were just what we expected.  The duck was excellent, and more than enough for my wife and I to split...and we still couldn't finish it all.  The fries were great....and good fries should never be taken for granted.  But, the dish that trumped them all was the clam stew.   The spicy brown broth was light...almost airy, and its all about the broth.  The stew was just spicy enough, without being overpowering.  I actually had a dream about it that night....

Food is where things fell apart.  The menu looks amazing - we had a hard time picking what we wanted to order because the combinations all sounded so interesting.  So we enlisted the help of our server who was extremely passionate about the duck empanada and malbec braised short ribs which were in our consideration set.

The duck lacked any real flavor or richness - neither the foir gras nor the habanero came through.  But the short ribs were honestly a disaster.  The meat was incredibly dry - we couldn't even imagine how something braised could be so dry, unless they make it once or twice a week and then reheat in the microwave.  We barely ate half, and I typically will finish anything.

Guac was fine, nothing special.  Definitely not worth $12 in terms of either quality or quantity.  Ambiance was nice, but not enough to balance out mediocre (at best) food.  Unfortunate - I was looking forward to this meal.",1,0,0

On December 25, the doors to the Mission swung open at 2 pm, and not a moment earlier.  The crowd gathered outside this rustic old building immediately swung into action, darting inside to secure a table in the much sleeker and un-Church-like confines of a trendy Latin American restaurant, where the only thing that's holy is the tequila selection.  

Indeed, the Mission boasts a most impressive interior, with beautiful furnishings that are aggressive but tasteful, contrasted nicely with antiquated style of the building itself.  Waiting for a table would hardly be a punishment on this festive day, but with a reservation, we were seated promptly.

The Mission is and always will be a successful restaurant, I think, because it serves truly first-rate food and drink.  There is no debating this.  Each dish that was brought out, from the duck empanadas to the crispy pork belly, packed enormous flavor into perfectly-textured bites.  The portions were sizable for appetizers, too, ensuring that you could create a tapas experience for yourself without going home hungry.  The cocktails were also delicately prepared and delicious, and in many cases inventive.  

Because this restaurant has the food and drink down to a tee, it has the potential to be a five-star powerhouse for years to come.  But I hesitate to anoint it as such due to some conspicuous flaws in service, which should be easy to fix.  On at least five different occasions through the meal someone on staff attempted to remove a plate before we were done eating.  The wait time for drinks was also too long, perhaps owing to the cocktails' complexity, but also perhaps to the need for another bartender to churn out drinks for a thriving and busy restaurant.  

Above all else, though, the service was friendly and generous, complementing well the warm and inviting vibe this space gives off.  Next time I make a southwest sojourn, I will gladly return.",0,0,0

I have to say I was impressed with the quality...and a restaurant that makes my very food-closeted friend try something new (pork belly), gets some stars from me.  The pork belly was amazing, just like I used to eat growing up, crunchy and fatty.  The mahi mahi tacos were pretty good, but I mostly liked the sauce cause the fish was just a piece of fried fish.  The tortillas were the size of a silver dollar...I'm just warning those expecting huge tacos here.
For dessert we had the churros...not my favorite since they deviated from the normal fried dough to a chocolate one, and served it with some espresso milkshake that was incredibly creamy.  Still wondering if they add condensed milk or something like that.  The ambiance in the patio was pretty nice, quiet enough, nice weather.  
But I still found this place overpriced.  Went out to dinner twice in a weekend to Scottsdale, and both times I was horrified by the prices.  I guess I'm paying for the ambiance and trendiness.  I would recommend this place to people but warning them to go get their drinks somewhere else since they are not special, but they charge you special prices (wink, wink).",0,0,0

The bar was pretty packed at this time of day, but the restaurant was empty.   Sit down in the restaurant area.  It is fun to watch the restaurant transition from a whimsical  Sunday Fun-day type atmosphere to an exotic and demure nightlife Restaurant.  Around 5pm, they begin to dim all of those gorgeous chandy's and close the thick shutters. Around 5:30pm, they start lighting and dispersing LOTS of little tiny votive candles to all the tables and wall mounted candelabras.   The restaurant is starting to fill little by little and the noise level goes from quiet to loud and bustling. The day shift is transitioning to night shift and the waiters are polishing their tables and preparing for a packed house. ( The restaurant is completely booked for dinner reservations ) The menu at this time of day is very simple as they are preparing for dinner.  But the simplicity of this menu makes it easy to order light hearted items.  The filet skewers and shrimp skewers are delicious.  Order the table side guacamole!! It is fantastic !  The bread pudding was delicious, but priced $2 cheaper on the menu than we were charged on our bill.  We were also charged for a chicken skewer $12, that we did not order.  We had to bring this to our waitress's attention after we received the bill. Good thing I doubled checked the bill as my husband didn't even look at it and just plopped his credit card down.  When I mentioned the discrepancy of pricing to the waitress. She took off the chicken skewer, but not the $2 additional charge for the bread pudding. We didn't push it, because who wants to be a bitch over $2, but just check your bill before you pay.  Overall, I loved they whole experience and I can't wait to go back!!!   Oh! I posted a picture of the bread pudding and the picture looks disgusting. Tried to delete the picture and I don't know how.  The bread pudding is delicious, even though the picture I took looks like bile topped with ice cream and bed bugs.",0,0,0

If 'the mission' of The Mission is to serve the best brunch in town...then...Mission easily accomplished. We went here for the weekend brunch the other day and our socks were completely knocked off by how amazing it was. 

To start...it's just such a quaint and unique restaurant. The salt bricks...the old chandeliers...the antique furniture...it all makes you feel like you've stept into some fine dining establishment in a South American town.

Food was AMAZING. To start the chips were fresh and crispy and the salsa tasted almost like it had just been made minutes ago. We then ordered a Black Bean Arepa with fries and a Cinnamon Almond Waffle. The BBA was delectable...two freshly made thick corn tortillas with egg, cheese, black beans, and peppers...it really hit the spot. The fries were a mix of regular and sweet potato, and honestly are some of the best fries I've had in recent memory. Thin, crunchy and fresh tasting. The waffle was also sent from heaven...drizzled with candied almonds, cinnamon, cream, and topped with cinnamon ice cream. It was basically a wedding of breakfast and dessert in all the right ways. Top top it all off...this all came out to a mere 19 bucks. Unbelievable. Incredible value for your money when you're eating at a nice place like this. You could easily go spend the same amount of money at Denny's for God's sake. 

It wasn't very busy when we were there and I'm not sure why. I'm guessing this place is more hoppin' around dinner time, and I can't wait to try their dinner menu. You've been warned though...you're missing out big time if you don't try brunch here. If they stop serving it due to a lack of demand, I might just explode like the dude at the end of Big Trouble in Little China. 

GO HERE. 5\/5.",14,5,7

We had tacos as a starter instead of salad, chicken and Mahi Mahi,  different and very good. Except they don't allow mixing the kinds so you have to have three of each, which gets old after two, if that were your entree. 
We had the salmon plate and chicken plate as our entree, both very good, beautiful presentation,  but extremely small portions and a little under seasoned. 
We didn't have a desert as they didn't seem very interesting.

You might wait 90 minutes for your food ostensibly because the classically trained French chef wasn't satisfied with the initial effort.

From the drunk Texan wearing the crayola- crayon inspired button down waving his hands in front of my wife's phone like a tool while she waited to be seated, to the lackluster guac that did not have much taste.  For the price of the meal, I was disappointed.  The best thing that we had was Crispy Pork & Cola Lime Glaze, which was served in a lettuce wrap.  That was tasty, so were the Pork Shoulder tacos.  

The biggest disappointment was the Pork Shoulder entre, which arrived with a tiny bowl of white bean puree.  The pork shoulder was lacking flavor and even more disheartening it was served so bare - just a big hunk of meat on a plate.  I wish I took a picture. 

I would recommend sticking with the tacos at this place.   Crayola Crayon shirt guy probably thinks the drinks are good, too.",0,0,0

You ask would you like anything else... or desert... don't specifically push expensive drinks as if that's being courteous. I shouldn't have given you my typical 20% tip. I won't ever again. In fact I won't ever order alcohol there again. When you get your bill for a hundred dollars and 60 of it is for way overpriced alcohol that sucks.

We started with a margarita which seemed fitting regardless of the fact that I am not generally a tequila fan. It was well presented, not too salty and really pretty good.

Next we each ordered Grilled Street Corn and Crispy Pork & Cola Lime Glaze. The Street Corn, I am told consisted of such things as skewered corn, butter, chile paprika and cilantro. Really delicious - you could make a meal of it. The pork belly was even better. Red onion, lettuce, peanut, cola with a hint of lime.

The place is empty for all practical purposes.  We're told unless we have a reservation, they can't seat us. So we're pointed to the bar area. It is now 6:30 and the dining tables are still half empty.  This is a good indication of bad management.  One doesn't tell a customer they can't be seat and must go to the bar to eat and then 2 hours later those same table are sitting there empty. 

The drinks are watered down and extremely pricey.  It is one thing to charge a high price (small Margarita $13 and a Mojito watered down $13) and to give value, it is another thing to rip-off the customer. 

The guacamole needed help as well.  We had to send it back to the kitchen for help.  You need to add Cilantro, onions, salt, etc. to the product, otherwise you may as well be eating raw avocados. 

The fish tacos were good I thought, but my wife hated them. The duck empenada was different.  I didn't like it, but my wife did.

The patio is our preference when it cools down. I suppose the main LOUD room would be a good place for that ""it's not me it's you"" conversation, because everybody is already screaming at each other to be heard when the drinks start flowing.

Wonderful quieter helpful service on the patio, excellent food, smaller size portions, good guac and chips made at your table for another $12, it adds up fast here but tasty. Really enjoyed the Shaved Kale Salad with heirlooms, blood orange, goat cheese & marcona almonds

The dish we are still talking about was a soup appetizer, Almejas Al Vapor, 
a Peruvian clam stew with rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, just fantastic.
So if you are trying to keep the bill down just have soup and salad and some of their excellent Sangria. Otherwise we had the Grouper which was a very small serving and a little overcooked, and the Pork Shoulder was excellent but again not a very large serving for the price. So be careful as you may leave here poorer and still hungry if you don't fill up on the better appetizers in our experience.
