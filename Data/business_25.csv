We had bottle service and the service was brilliant, but it was really hot and outside did not feel like a club atmosphere. The speakers in the cabana were distorted and so you could not put the music up. 
I wish we were inside but it was $5k for a table, and the dance floor was too busy and like a concert with everyone holding up their phones to record Afrojack who was playing. 
Music was incredible, people dancing in the pool and loads of amazing girls, again just being outside did not help with mingling with people. IF you came as a mixed group you would have had a fab time.

All facilities in this place were amazing. I have never seen toilet attendants so diligent, I did not mind tipping them every time I went in.

I think the place gets confused with being a club and a chill out lounge outside. It does both and you have a choice...but only if you can afford it.

Maybe need to go back on a different weekend as it was Independence weekend and so it was super busy.

Apparently some guy inside bought 100 bottles of Dom, and was handing it out. Sums up Vegas hey..!",1,1,1

The ladies gorgeous - but can you not all wear black dresses with no accessories? 
Guys - not as gorgeous. Except I met a football player who shall remain anonymous and we were there before Magic and there were alot of nicely-clothed men.

Gambling option in the club was cool - loved dancing in the wading area of the pool - my feet hurt! BUT the DJ - um meh. Def not the best which kinda ruins the ambiance of the club.
 I mean you charge people $$ to get in so please spend some of it on a DJ that can mix. Which is not related to my request for more hiphop. Maybe that isn't your crowd, XS. Crowd was not diverse.

The cabanas were cool, there are like three lounge couches... I dont know if I'd do that because the even the line for table reservations was monstrous.

Things to KNOW:
The chandeliers in the main dance area make it rain - Grown men will push a girl in heels for a dollar.
 
The lounge beds that sit in the pool are for everyone - so if some ass comes up to you and says you cant sit there - this is our area - they paid for the circle beds around the pool and bottle service - you do not have to move or leave. 

If you get in, you have ins and out without having to wait in that horrid line - juts make sure your stamp is still there. So take a break - go eat something, hit the tables or a strip club, come back.",6,2,2

This use to be the spot but times have changed.

Good pricing for cheap tables but they put you way in the back behind the pool which limits the traffic.

Nothing special here... Though, sorta a nice alternative club to come party @ not terrible by any means.

Seems to be heavily frequented by the Asian community - no prob w\/ that. 

*BUT* horrible entry system!

Even w\/ a table we waited 45 mins, maybe an hour, to get in and it was a major hassle for us to get in - truly a major bummer to the evening.

They weren't rude but it was ""cold treatment"" um ok like what, come on! Immediate VIP big baller treatment and entry is the whole point of bottle service. I mean ready to spend several grand for a dang table and alcohol that really costs $100, lets be honest, and you're treated like chumps... Jeez! Yeah well, not worth it once we got in, but not bad... just regular and blah...

We did have fun here but it was the last night after raging out all weekend and XS definitely didn't send us out with a bang. Too be honest it kind of felt like staying in on a Sunday after heavy partying all weekend. Like our being there was perfunctory because it was the last night to rage so we had to go out but we weren't really feeling it (that BS trying to get in really killed the vibe). Hey but shouldn't a good club get you amped, especially if you have table service in Las Vegas of all places w\/ a star DJ spinning? XS just didn't kick us back into gear to have a great time it was just meh...

They have a $20 entrance fee and a coat check area for $5.  Quick tip that the bouncer told us...if you have a lotta jackets, you can actually double them up when you hand it over for a coat check and they'll only charge you $5 for 2 jackets.  The ladies in the coat check will see that it's 2 coats, but they won't say anything.  But back to the music...you MUUUSTT come on a friday night here.  It's a LOT less crowded on friday nights AND the music is strictly top 40s.  We came back again on a saturday night and while the music was still better than those at other clubs, it was still mainly house music, which we are not fans of.

I went to XS during my 21st birthday weekend. My group (5 girls, 9 guys) got into the club immediately (one of our friends knew a promoter). The girls got in for free, but the guys were charged $40. 

The crowd was a little older (28-30+) & they were playing a lot of throw-backs that night. It all worked out though, because you can gamble on the other side of the club!! 

Genius layout planning. They've incorporated a pool into the club & the bar flanks both sides of the club - making it easy to always get a drink.

The interior is very nice. It is spacious, beautiful lights, inside pool, blackjack tables and a few bars. This club is top notch and very expensive looking. My night here at XS is quite blurry so I can not say anything more about the place. 

The line to get in was VERY long, but it moved quickly. A lot of pretty girls in short skanky dresses and guys dressed to impress. So please don't come here looking all janky because everyone looked nice. Two of us were in line while one person went to go buy a soda. By the time he got back, they would not let him join us in line. -.- WTH man??? The line was SO long, what if someone had to leave the line to take a quick bathroom break??? We'd have to go to the end of the line again? Ugh, that sucked, but whatever. 

The cover that night was $20 for girls and $50 for boys. The drinks at the bar were about $14. Quite pricey, but what do you expect from vegas? We had some long islands BEFORE we actually went into XS on the casino floor. ((x WAY cheaper, like free cheap and you only have to deal with TIP.

I'm knocking off one star because we had to wait in line even though we purchased pre sale tickets online, the pre sale tickets had to be printed,  the staff was rude, and the crowd was out of control and pushy at times. There were a wide range of age groups at this club. There were some kids that looked like high schoolers as well as some older people that looked like they were in their 50s or 60s. 

I bought pre sale tickets the day of the show at http:\/\/xs.wantickets.com on Sunday night to see Red Foo from LMFAO. Tickets were $40 including the service charge for guys and $30 including the service charge for girls. I think the price depends on who is playing. Before we went in, they gave us all Party Rocking black framed glasses which were fun and cool. The stage is pretty small so we were able to get pretty close. There is a small gap between the stage and the pool however and people push you even though you have nowhere to go. Hok from So You Think You Can Dance was there and Lil Jon showed up as well! They shot inflatable zebras, confetti, and streamers into the crowd. There were also laser lights and they sprayed everyone with champagne during the song ""Champagne Showers"" which was hilarious. Before we left, we sat in the booths inside outside the bathroom for a few seconds until a guy who worked there came up to us and told us to stand up. I didn't understand why all these booths had to be empty. Despite the rude staff and pushy crowd though, it was a fun night. :)",0,0,0

This is the best decorated nightclub in Vegas and it also has some of the prettiest ladies, and recently, Steve Wynn made sure to book the best house dj's in the world to this venue (2012 resident lineup includes Calvin Harris, deadmau5, David Guetta, Tiesto - to name a few). The club looks like Tryst when you enter but is definitely larger and instead of the waterfall of Tryst, XS has a huge outdoor pool with casino tables. 

Some of my friends that despise cramped nightclubs will venture into this place because the pool area is very wide open and there is alot of room to move around and it is not as dark and packed. This makes it easier for them to pick up chicks. 

As a Las Vegas local, the best time to hit this venue is on a Sunday night in the summer because they open up the pool and allow club patrons to wear swim attire and jump in!",1,0,0

We started out by the pool and then went inside and danced -- there wasn't much dancing outside but maybe it gets started later on (we left around 2:30).

I work in the industry and I have never been shunned like that before. He immediately pointed at my one guy friend and said ""Is that guy with you? No. No. Just no. He has to pay."" And my friend said that was fine and was ready to pay, but he totally ignored it and continued to tell us no. I understand being in a bad mood from dealing with guests all day, but the way he treated us was absolutely unacceptable. He said ""just go to surrender"" and kept avoiding eye contact. And completely ignored us. When we asked his last name he refused to let us know but he immediately responded with a ""why do you need my name?! What's going on!!!"" In a nasty attitude! because he knew he was being a complete jerk. I have NEVER been treated like that ever before and this man needs an attitude check. I have worked in clubs for years and I have never acted that way to a guest or have had anyone act that way to me. I would give zero stars for this experience if I could. We don't even know why we stood there for the 4 minutes that we did and took that abusive attitude!

My boyfriend and I went to see Skrillex on 8\/29 at XS and it was a phenomenal show. First of all, the venue is absolutely flawless. It has reserved booths, couches, tables, cabanas and a bar in the middle of the pool area. It also has a perfect-sized dance floor in front of the DJ stand. It may get a bit crowded (they do let about 11,000 people in during the course of one night 10PM-4AM) but what's the nightlife like without getting pushed and shoved once or twice ;) Be sure to get there early though, or you may be waiting in line for an extended amount of time!

The service is great from what I experienced. The staff is constantly clearing finished drinks around the club and maintaining it as much as they can. The bartenders were super good-looking and very sweet! 

The DJ before Skrillex played a good show too. I actually enjoyed when he was playing a bit more because less people were on the dance floor and my boyfriend and I got to stay upfront all night. It was amazing. Skrillex killed it, obviously, and the lights\/effects\/bass were all up to par.

Outside pool area where you could cool off, chill, and even dance! Be careful though, people drop their drinks and there are glass shards on the floor. Someone cut their food and there was a bloody mess alongside the pool. Lovely!

Pretty people. Hot go go dancers. I'm a girl and when I saw these dancers, I was like Dayuumm! Mmm music was okay... a tad too much techno\/electronica\/dance etc...even tho that's the new hip thing.

We didn't wanna stay inside the actual club so we went out and found a spot to the side of the stage. It was PERFECT. Better to be outside because it was hot but cool breezes, it's not super crowded like inside and the view's just better. Some people were swimming\/dancing in the pool, it was nice!

In the super VIP area around the stage, you know the area that costs like 50 thousand to get, Steve Aoki was there to support Zedd! It was dope. Two super hott djs in one area!

Very cool place, great vibe, drinks start off around 15 bucks. I got in via a promoter so he cut me a deal for 40 bucks for me and 40 for my buddy (dude).

While I have never been here Friday or Saturday where it might be crazier, Sunday night seems so chill. Here's how you get in:

- Find those VIP passes for Sunday nights at the Wynn gift shop or if you must, find those nightclub guys on the strip giving them out for a price. I was able to grab some from my last trip (11\/09) and they were still being honored at the door. Bouncers are professional; he even said Happy Birthday to me too haha

- Get there early at 10pm. I know that seems early, but you just need that coveted stamp on your hand. Leave the club, pre-party and come back to the stamp line when its poppin. 

- Apparently Sunday nights during the summer at XS are Nightswim Sundays so dress code is really relaxed. I saw dudes walking in with boardshorts, t-shirts, and flip flops. I didn't get the memo so I felt overdressed.

The club is beautiful and huuuge. There's millions of staff walking around and millions of bottle service tables everywhere. The bathroom attendants are nice. The only downside is that the music is 95% house. I'm definitely coming back though.

The entrances are kind of small and to get outside, you have to make your way through the entire club. The whole place is packed full of people and the dance floor is extremely cramped. The other thing I didn't like was the DJ was only playing techno type music. I don't know what type of music they normally play, but I'm not a fan.

I decided to celebrate my birthday at XS last Saturday after having a great time there with some local friends during my last trip to Vegas and after hearing that deadmau5 was djing that night. As a guest of Encore, I was able to purchase tickets through the concierge that supposedly gave my group access to a shorter, faster line than the others (although none of the lines seemed very long when we got there around 11pm) and unlimited exit\/re-entry. We got in quickly and got our drinks even faster as there was no wait for the bar. The dance floor wasn't too crowded at that point, so we decided to dance for a bit and, despite all the obnoxious people, were having a great time until I realized my brand new rose gold iPhone 6s had been stolen right out of my (closed) purse.

At some point, while I was chatting with a guy who had introduced himself awhile back, this couple approached us from behind and the woman leaned forward (between me and the guy I was hanging out with) and asked if we saw a phone on the ground. I crouched down to look and when I stood back up, opened my purse (small cross body bag w\/ a front flap that snaps closed) and reached into the front pocket for my phone so that I could turn on the flashlight to help her look...it was gone. And once I realized that, so was she. 

Initially, I thought maybe I'd dropped it without realizing and had, like, 3 different groups of guys and my friends looking around the dance floor for my phone. But when we couldn't find it, my two friends and I found a bouncer who did nothing but tell me to try to track it via Find My iPhone, which of course didn't work because thieves immediately turn off stolen phones so they can't be tracked. When I showed him that the phone was ""offline,"" his super helpful and empathetic response was, ""Yeah, they stole it."" He directed us to a female bouncer who essentially tried to victim-blame me by telling me I should have been wearing my cross body bag across my body and facing inwards (because that's super attractive and normal..I've lived in DC, LA and Italy and was never robbed, so why should I have to do that at an expensive club in a supposedly five star hotel?) and told us to file a report. However, she somehow directed us to the coat check girl and at that point I was so upset that we just left. 

After reading a few pages of recent yelp reviews I'm even more angry because it's become totally clear by the number of female reviewers reporting stolen phones (and wallets, in some cases) that this is a huge problem at this particular club that no one involved with the club or hotel has any intention of doing anything about. One woman wrote a Yelp review the day after my birthday saying her phone was stolen the same night as mine! Given how often this is happening and the fact that they seem to be targeting women on the dance floor, it really seems like a specific group of regulars is working this club. Yet, security isn't even warning women about the problem, let alone stepping up their presence around the dance floor and reviewing security videos to try to figure out who's doing this on a weekly basis. This is a nightclub in a Vegas casino; I'm pretty sure security is their forte and they could easily figure out who's doing this if they so chose. 

I'd personally never return and probably wouldn't even stay at the Wynn or Encore again, despite my otherwise great experience (aside from their salon, which is terrible). The woman who checked me out of my $319\/night room did at least show some concern, but had no real advice and offered no compensation.",4,1,0

I told her nicely but she kept saying there is some system they go by and she cant give us another. After a while we insisted to talk to a manager. Manager came and told us nothing he can do. More time goes by and now I am really frustrated. We are all professionals, doctors, real estate broker, investment banker and not some kids trying to pull a fast one. I asked them to check the security tapes. It took them a long time and Manager came back and said there was a mistake and gave us another bottle.

This place definitely lived up to my standards!!! It's true, us ladies got in for FREE on Saturday and barely waited in line. Two days of XS in a row was definitely not ""X-cessive."" If anything, I am still craving for more. Great times dancing the night away and meeting new people who just want to have a freakin' good time. 

On the way out of the club..people were tossin' BILLSBILLSBILLS up in the air...LOL...too bad they were only ONE-DOLLA BILLS! 

By far, THEE-BEST Vegas trip I've had in a long time! Thanks XS for making this trip memorable! Until we meet again..stay CLASSY!!",9,10,10

Layout wise this place is incredible. Really a spectacular visually appealing club however the crowd control last night was absolutely horrific. The bar areas and dance floor were an absolute warzone that surprisingly didn't result in any serious injuries for our group. We spent 45 minutes trying to get drinks so we bought doubles all around and had one drink all night. We bought tickets online ahead of time and got two stamps at the door that very easily rub off resulting in me getting in a loud argument with the bouncer because he wouldn't let my girlfriend back in because the stamp had faded. How about you use a UV stamp like every other club!? I finally told him to piss off because I wasn't going to get cheated out of the $350 I paid to get us in. I know what you're thinking...no she's not ugly, she's very attractive. He agreed to let her in after a pretty heated argument. I know that we aren't the $15,000 bottle service customers you are looking for, but in the real world $500 on one night is a ton of money for two young people and we expect to be treated with some respect and have enough space to enjoy ourselves. We have been to Vegas 12 times between the two of us, and have plenty of experience with clubs and raves so this isn't a review from someone who hates clubs and doesn't know it. Kaskade is my girlfriend's absolute favorite, and he definitely delivered a great performance but we were really hoping this would be a better experience from the venue.",0,0,0

Your feet will be spared of nightmarish stairs and there are plenty of places to give them a break. XS touts some of the best djs, and it never disappoints in diversity. Sound system is great so you can dance from anywhere without having to be near the main stage.

For the grand finale, I suggest jumping into the pool at the end of the night. Unless you have a bathing suit on, you will be escorted out like a celebrity. ;)

The drinks are expensive ($24 for a vodka tonic and beer), so drink before you go. I liked the music, there was Lady Gaga once in a while, and that's all I really care about.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention- it was so cool in there! Even on the dance floor, it never felt hot, humid, and sweaty like you do when you're dancing!

The line was crazy at 10:30.  Good thing that we had a promoter to get us in quickly.  I would say it was well worth it.  

No doubt that this place is for the high rollers I mean it's at the Encore for goodness sake.  This was the club to be if you wanna find a sugar daddy.  

In all honestly, it seems like this place was made for the sole purpose of bottle service.  I've never seen so many tables at a club like was all hunched together like that.  You might as well do it big in Vegas right?

I hate how crowded it was.  I was literally shoving my elbows at people so they would get out of my personal bubble.  Did not have this problem at the Marquee as much.  They really do need to open the place a bit more or crowd control.  They didn't open up the pool area which I was sad about.

The variety of the music was good kept things going and fresh.  The go go dancers could have better, I mean I really have seen better.  I liked how when the dancers are done they start going around trying to sell shooters for $24 for 2.  At least I don't have to move from my dancing spot.

The bathrooms were amazing! They had everything you need for the night.

Tip: wear heels.  I know it sucks and it hurts your feet and you can't get it on but if you don't then you're going to get stabbed by the other heels and you're left with nothing to defend yourself.

So yes I am giving it 3 stars because it was super crowded to me and bitches were hating and all that.  Maybe next time I'll have better luck.",0,4,0

A long island will run you $17. Other mixed drinks around $15. I'm glad they didn't close off the outside like some other clubs just because it's November.

Since we arrived early, the line moved fairly quick. But I imagine anytime later, the line would be longer. We tell them the promoter's name and get 2 stamps. One for being 21, and another for entry. We also got a free drink ticket. They don't tell you this but the ticket must be used BEFORE 1AM. The bartender told us that and we were unable to even redeem it.

We were led into a beautiful pool area. Don't go into the pool or security will take you out. There are day beds that you can hang out around for free though that were pretty comfy to sit on until the main DJ came on. There was also a dance floor area outside and screens to see the DJ since they face the inside of the club. 

When Skrillex came out, we wanted to go inside and check out the inside for a bit. We show the bouncer our stamps and says we need 3 stamps to get in and that the promoter only gets you to the outside area. Say what?? Of course they never tell you that. I'm not sure what it would have been to get inside, but we weren't going to pay since we had to pay the night before.

It was a beautiful night out though, so I don't want to bash the outside area. I did enjoy my time out there, I just did not care for the deceptive practice of the promoters. Had I known, we could have bought tickets earlier at a cheaper price to get inside.

In my past 11 Vegas trips between July 2014- April 2016, I always come to XS each and every time- still my favorite. This review update combines some new info as well as some good tips for those new to the Vegas club scene. 

FIRST (and most important to my cheap Chinese self)... WHY PAY to go to a club? Duh, total rookie mistake, folks. Ladies, you can get in for FREE. (Girl\/guy ratio may be 2:1 or 1:1, depending on the night.) 
** For da hook up, text Rich (702.205.8595) and tell him you heard about him in my review... he will help you out with as many perks as possible like free drink tickets.

Entry for guy groups: if you find yourself in the general admission line, purchase a ticket online beforehand. The price can multiply x4 at the door, depending on the day and time. Also, dress the damn part. No girl wants to talk to your hoe ass if you dressed like shit in a club anyway, and that's what half of you want, right? You're fckkin' welcome.

Space:
- Even if you don't have a table, outdoors is huge with plenty of ledge space for you to rest your tired feet when you need it. No other club in Vegas offers that.
- Beautifully lit space with effects indoors and out. I take a picture each and every time here because it never gets old.
- Plenty of bathroom stalls, mirrors, and sinks with a staff directing bathroom traffic for efficiency. They get you in and out fast when you need to pee. Bring cash to tip these folks, too.
- Like EVERY other club in Vegas except Drai's, dance floor is uncomfortably TIGHT.

Timing:
- Entry line isn't too bad yet since summer isn't in full swing, but I'd say get there before 10:30PM to avoid waiting. 
- Headliner comes on around 1:30-2, but the house DJ is always 100

Staff:
- Edit April 2017: Staff isn't nearly what it used to be for some reason. I use free drink tickets and tip on each drink, but the bartenders' attitudes have gotten disgustingly shittier in my past two visits. 
- Bouncers are cooler and more polite than other clubs. Just keep your shoes on, and don't punch anyone in the face.
- XS casino dealers outside are some of the most fun dealers I've met on the strip. As I like to say, if you're gonna take my money, make me like it. If you are up, don't forget to tip\/bet for the dealer, too.

Drinks: If you're bitching about the price of drinks here, you should probably not be on the strip. The price is not an XS problem... it's a 5-star-hotel-on-the-Strip-problem. Recommend you read my previous review for XS if you haven't been to a Vegas night club before. 
** TIP: If you don't want to spend $$$$ on drinks, pre-game in your hotel and then GAMBLE before the headliner comes on. If you gamble, drinking is free! They have $15 black jack tables most nights.

On crazy nights like Friday and Saturday, if you are guest list (free via Rich) and not paying, you only get access to outside where the pool area is, which some people actually like better. ($25 to get access inside.) It makes sense since the inside is miserably crowded during peak months.
**If you're wondering the value of going with a promoter if you want inside anyway, you can get free drink ticket(s)!!

Schedule:
- Friday: Busiest
- Saturday: More Busiest
- Sunday: Sunday night swim starts again this third weekend of April. Come in a swim suit to splash around to Skrillex, or you can still dress to the nines. Towels provided. 
- Monday: Killer party night here. LA crowd has gone home, and it's packed still... but less crowded.

Tip 1: Think about what heels you're wearing before you even get into the club! Basic girls be sitting down in the guest list line on the carpet before getting to the door! (You'll get told off.) 

Tip 2: If you need a cab home after a big night, the line at the Encore can be stooopid long. Take a short hike over to the Wynn, and you can cut your wait time into half.

Tip 3: Do NOT put your purse down at ANY time unless you have your own table. Shit gets stolen, no matter where on this earth you are. I recommend a small purse that fits perfectly under your arm pit so that you can still dance with ease.

Tip 4: It is NEVER ok for anyone to touch anyone else in a club, so don't people get away with that. I walk with an arm in front of me in crowded spaces, kind of like ""back the fck off."" If someone does, tell a bouncer, or just punch that person in the nuts. 

Hope this was helpful, and I hope you enjoy XS as much as I do. Hit me up if you need help comparing Vegas clubs for your upcoming trip to Vegas as I love that shit... See you at XS!",57,28,24

Everything positive about this club is true...truly the most lavish, luxurious and unique club I have ever stepped foot in.

You know how at Pure you are herded around like cattle and have to resort to sitting on the ladies' room counter when your feet ache?

Every time I make a Vegas trip, I always have to save a day for XS :D.

First time in Vegas: XS, Sunday night, David Guetta was performing
My 3 girlfriends and I were on the guest list so we went into a separate line (I always feel like such a princess when I'm in Vegas haha!) Once we got into the club, I was so amazed with everything! We sat down and guys were already approaching us with cranberry volka and red bull volka. Yummmm! I'm not going to lie, but that stripper pole is amazing!! Especially because it got really crowded that night because it was the Sunday of labor day weekend. It was so crowded that I was not able to walk anywhere so my friends and I danced at the stripper pole area. These guys approached us to join their VIP table and of course we said yes. :). I had an amazing time! XS always treats me right!

Second time in Vegas: Friday night, April 5th, 2013. David Guetta was also performing.
It was a lot less crowded this time. I was able to get onto the dance floor to see David Guetta up close! It was a wonderful experience. :). 

What I really like about XS is the pool area. I love how they open the pool so we can soak our feet in it. Come on girls! Being able to take off your heels and soaking them in water feels so good! 

XS usually only have an all girls guest list, so make sure your guy friends buy presale tickets to skip the crazy long line! 

Oh XS also gives girls on the guest list a free complimentary drink! :D",6,0,2

XS has an incredible DJ line up (Diplo, Zedd, etc.) so you know you're going to get awesome quality music! What I did notice about this nightclub is that it's actually very spacious, but the club still gets packed on weekend nights.  The sound system and the lights are out of this world, and the views from inside overlooking the outdoor section are beautiful! And did I mention there's an awesome pool outside too! The outdoor section also is very spacious and the layout of the club is excellent ... dancing space everywhere... bars located near by in just about every corner ... and you can hear the music from anywhere 100% perfect! Amazing club, and a lot of fun! The only reason why I deducted a star is because entry into the club was a bit ridiculous.  I understand the strategy of having multiple lines and entry points to control traffic flow into the club... table service, guest list, tickets, etc. that's okay I understand that.

The club is located in the Encore hotel and is the crown jewel of the Wynn properties.  The club is huge! Probably one of the largest  in sheer square footage I have ever seen.  The inside is your typical run of the mill night club space, however what makes this place stand out more than the average joint is the beautiful outdoor patio! 

The patio is larger then the club itself and it is decorated with palm trees and beautiful pools that are scattered over the property.  Out in the middle is an island of sorts where there is another huge bar and playing tables. The pools are all beautifully lit and even change colors at night to enhance the decor.  This place was designed to make you feel like you are in an oasis in the middle of the desert, and I must say they hit the nail on the head.

Saturday nights are crazy here.  They let it way too many people which is why I'm giving it 3 stars and not more.  On top of that the cab line after the club let out was almost an hour long.  In addition the crowd is not your average crowd...this place is full of  over privileged elitist.  Check any sincerity you may have at the door! 

However I highly recommend XS on Sunday nights! No where near as crowded and it's definitely the place to be on Sundays.

But, I really didn't have much of a great time here considering it's suppose to be one the best in Sin City. Maybe, it was the music.  Which was more Techno than Hip Hop.  Or maybe it was the crowd, which I wasn't feeling.  There were some nice ones out of the bunch, but most of them were stuck-up. Although, I have to give it up to security though, because they sure did a good job at making that line move.  I was kinda feelin' bad for the guys during Memorial Day Weekend though.

We were hesitant about going during the week because we were not sure what the environment would be like on a weekday, but we figured we would check things out. The goal was to explore places we had never been. Our first night we decided to check out XS, and we are so glad we did. Rachel, one of the promoters for XS & Tryst, hooked us up with free entry and no line. She also gave us some comped drinks to start the night off. 

We were shocked at how big the venue was, and surprisingly how many people were there on a Monday night. Immediately, we had a feeling it was going to be a great night....and it was! We mingled with groups around the pool and danced the night away. The music was great! The crowd was young and fun! We even got a little ""daring"" and danced knee deep in the pool (I think we may have had too many of the comped drinks). We had so much fun and next to Surrender at Encore, it was our favorite club we visited on our trip!

I love the layout, basically there is an outdoor portion with the pools and indoor club are. The Dj is in between the outdoor and indoor. This is great because if you dont like crowd and sweat, you can totally go to the outdoor part. This makes both areas less crowded. Best thing is, sometimes they have swim nights when you can be in your swim outfit and go to the pool. 

The only thing that this place lacks is lights and big LCD screens, but thats nothing for me because the overall experience outweights that.

They're only really fun if you go with a large group of attractive ladies, do a LOT of pre-partying in your hotel beforehand, or both. Otherwise, you can be prepared to spend enough to buy a small country. 

That being said, XS is probably my favorite one so far. Came here with a bachelorette party of 14 ladies, and thanks to a promoter, got in gratis. We made friends with some guys with a cabana so we got to hang out there, and made friends with others with bottle service. Hey, I'm more than willing to trade conversation for free drinks! No shame! 

This club is absolutely beautiful. It's stylish, swanky, has a gorgeously lit outdoor pool area that makes you feel like you're at a tropical resort, and definitely lives up to the ""excess"" of its name. Definitely aesthetically stunning, and that's what sets a club apart. 

I didn't buy any drinks here, as I took advantage of tip #2 in the first paragraph, but I heard they were as overpriced as can be expected. Calvin Harris was a guest DJ that night, so the place was PACKED. 

I know clubs get crowded and especially with well-known DJs, but I'm docking this one 1 star because of the lack of any crowd control. Most clubs have security guards EVERYWHERE, making sure people can move around easily and that all walkways are clear. In this case, it took about 30 minutes (not exaggerating) to get from one side of the club to another because of the sheer amount of people.... bottlenecking in the pool entrance, and crowding every door so that it was impossible to move in any direction; you had to just wait to be pushed along with the crowd, however long they stood still. In this case, I would welcome any kind of security just to make sure this didn't happen. Not only is it frustrating, but doesn't really seem safe. 

Despite that, I had a great time dancing the night away, and loved the lights and effects. It was also cute to be hollered at by the barely-legal club-goers, one who told me he was ""celebrating his buddy's 21st."" I tried not to giggle when he said that.
Him: ""So where did you go to school?""
Me: ""UCLA.""
""Oh, cool! What year did you graduate?""
I told him, and the smile dropped off his face. ""How old ARE you?""
""29,"" I answered, trying again not to laugh.
""You're kidding. You are NOT 29.""
""No, I really am."" A few minutes later, he politely excused himself.

Because it's so big and has so much capacity, everyone in line who gets there before 10 will get in when the doors open. Cover is $30 for guys, $20 for girls but I don't mind that at all for Vegas. The outdoor pool and casino is awesome. The DJ is sick because he mixes hip-hop and house. The bartenders are nice. Bouncers are cool. A definite must for any Vegas clubber. I can't give it 5 stars just because I wished they had a bigger dance floor. But this place is great.",1,0,0

There is a good reason people consider this to be the best nightclub in Vegas. Yes, it is expensive. Yes, cover can run you $50 and you're not going to find any decent liquor for less than $15-20. But does any of that matter once you realize you're in the most luxurious, beautiful, spacious club on the Strip and arguably one of the finest in the world? The crowd is attractive, the house DJ is great and the guest DJs legendary, the drinks stiff and delicious, and the staff is attentive and eager. The space is massive and the outside area is THE place to be on a hot summer evening.

The other 20 percent are old decent looking  rich cougars lol. The one thing that really pissed me off was when   I went to the bar to get my drinks for me and my girl and my card was declined. I was like WTF I just got paid how the hell did my card get declined. I spent all the cash I had on me buying my homie some drinks and leaving tips. I asked the bartender to try the card again and she said no. I gave her the drinks back and said ok  forget it I don't know why my card is being declined, I had a couple thousand in the bank so I know I was good. She acted like I was trying to pull a fast one and called security over to the bar. I explained the same thing to him but he didn't give a shit either. So he tells me and I quote "" normally we kick people out for trying to buy drinks and the their card declines but imma let u slide my N***A just don't come back to the bar."" I was like first off I am not anybody's N***a I'm Cuban u fuck and second why do I need to be told not go back to the bar obviously I understand that my card isn't working why would I go hang out at the bar. Just because the  Wynn is full of Rich white people doesn't mean that you have to treat other people like minority scum.

You can also play some blackjack out there too, but really, if you wanted to gamble you probably should have just stayed in the casino...unless you're trying to be seen.

Drinks are expensive (this is Vegas clubbing after all), but it's not impossible to get the attention of the bartenders.  We got a cabana outside by the pool last time we went, which required one bottle for every 3 guys (each bottle was around $400, not including tip).

The layout...circle inside and I can't speak for the outside because I never made it out there. The DJ booth is inside at the head of the circle when you walk in. I saw kaskade and galantis here on a Saturday night...PACKED to the MAX...also justin beiber and diplo made cameos so it was pretty cool.

Layout- One big circle with bottlenecks everywhere esp when you are trying to go the bathroom
Bathroom- Not gonna lie...it's pretty nice in the bathroom, the mirrors are cool. Probably one of the better bathroom layouts of the clubs in vegas

This starts with nit-picking @ every aspect of it, criticizing the people inside, and then maybe even the dbag bouncers; the exception to the rule is XS---THE nightclub of LV.  As a very eager & avid patron of Las Vegas, the city of brotherly sin, one is almost forced to bed with it's alluring, tantalizing, and philandering twin sister, i.e. ""the LV Nightclub.""  I've had my more-than-enough-for-a-person's-lifetime share of clubs, but I have yet to get tired of XS nor do I foresee myself EVER getting tired of XS (up to this point).  Well, unless I get so girthy that my presence in XS becomes a detriment to those around me, the limited dance space and breathing air.  

Me & XS have a long, dated history together.  I started visiting XS pretty much within the first few months of its grand opening.  7 years ago, just getting into a 21+ club was enough to get giddy and the perfect excuse to get blasted, forget about all the student debt you owed, and of course lose all the crammed knowledge you paid thousands of dollars to acquire . In fact the club didn't really matter that much since you would barely recognize your friends, let alone the venue in which you're throwing up in.  Life was so simple & my standards were so low.  

At it's core, XS is still very, very similar to how it once was @ its inception, with the exception of the enormous DJ booth\/stage that now occupies the dance floor (and removed about 30% of the total dance space) and the addition of a few more tables located around the dance (also reducing the dance space even more! :( However, despite the reduction of overall free-space and breathing room, XS security does ensure your safety by closing the dance floor off during peak hours\/popular nights.  So once you get in, I don't recommend you leaving unless you plan on dancing up on the pole areas (not recommend for guys....but shamefully executed this for no real reason :( ) or you plan on dancing in random spaces (completely acceptable considering the asphyxiating dance floor).   Also, don't go into the pool or you'll get kicked out (unless you look really good in a wet t-shirt\/dress)

Furthermore, if you venture outside onto it's pool area, they may even limit you from going back inside the club itself!!  **IF THE NIGHT IS PACKED, THIS WILL HAPPEN* Your solution? Leave the club and re-enter with your hand stamp w\/o waiting :)  Other than these slight re-entry issues and closed dance floors, I'm usually too intoxicated to care about anything else except having fun with my friends.  

So if you've reached this far down this review, I will  reward you the accumulation of ""wisdom"" that I've acquired in my 20+ times visiting XS.

1) W\/ the advent of the ""internet,"" you can buy pre-sale tickets to popular nights for a HUGE DISCOUNT compared to what you may pay if you procrastinate and wait til the last minute.  If you actually read this far, you are probably an intelligent person who wishes to make your life easier.  These pre-sale tickets (if bought 3-4 weeks in advance) can be 50% cheaper and will all you to enter the club within 1% of the wait time you would encounter in the general admission line. ONE PERCENT!!! You can also save your buzz\/drink less inside!

2)  If you have failed to prepare pre-sale tickets, there is a plan B to salvage your night.  Go with your group and start waiting in line @ 9\/915pm.  You can enter the empty club, admire how nice and cool it looks sober & desolate, then leave & go back to your room to pre-party...then come back to XS at ANY TIME you want w\/o waiting!!! This will shave about 1-2 hours of line-waiting (they also raise prices later in the night).
  
3) So let's say you have managed to fail both steps 1 & 2, can you believe you still have one other (less desirable) option!?  Once you are in line, waiting like a sheepish fool, I recommend that a confident, savvy soul approach one of the line-guardsmen and ask the guy if there's any way he can get you guys in.  He will tacitly nod his head and say something along the lines of ""what do you got?""  At this point, you will offer this genteel, suited man a ""bribe"" to get you and your drunk, yet standing straight & conscious friends in.  To not insult him, I would start @ an offer of $35 a head or $40 a head.   At most, offer him $50\/guy. **this all depends on how much cover is too**  If cover is $30, offer him 20\/25.  If cover is $40, offer him $30\/35.  This will work, just don't be a jerk, overly aggressive, or rude.  This ""bribe"" will allow you to skip line AND pays for cover. How can you NOT do this?   I guarantee you this will save at least 1-2 hrs in line if you start it early enough. THIS IS WORTH THE EXTRA TIME INSIDE!

Other than this, have fun, drink alot, dance til you can't feel your feet, and try not to get kicked out. But if you do get kicked out, make it count i.e. come out in a wheelchair",10,7,5

I am from Chicago visiting my family here in Vegas and last night my siblings and I experienced not only rude bouncers but one that discriminated against my sister.

We were looking forward to going to XS and seeing DJ Snake, especially since I am new to Vegas. First of all, when we arrived, they have no signs of what line we go to....instead, we kept getting re-directed until we finally found the general admission line. 

We found out that ticket prices doubled than from what was online so we politely stepped outside the line to go the side to talk about what we should do and how much cash we had to distribute for the ticket price. The bouncer at the general admissions line, an older African American man with a mustache wearing blue ended up giving us a hard time and directed us to an area where we can discuss, which we did. He then ended up rushing us out of the area we were waiting and decided to offend my sister by commenting on her ""level of education"" all because she has a thick accent. 

I have never in my life seen my sister be discriminated against and for me to see that is very upsetting. We were polite and kind the entire time yet he had to throw out an insult to ruin our night. We were about to go inside to pay double the price all because we were excited to see this club and DJ but because of the treatment of this gentleman, we decided to take our money elsewhere. 

I understand that you go through many drunk and out of hand people all the time, but we were 100% sober and respectful. I am hoping that others are not treated like this at this hotel and club.",7,1,0

Do it here! 

Poolside bottle service, outdoor sofas, table side drink concoctions with all the trimmings. Being outdoors is ideal when you're working up a major sweat dancing seven hours straight!

DJ, stage and light shows can be seen from both the inside and outside of club. Indoors desperately needs more ventilation. Cool kid vibes, great DJs, and kickass sound system. 

Clean bathrooms with all the girly necessities and emergency items. Good amount of security for those self loathing, raging alcoholics trying to steal your bottle. 

There was a nice, blonde, polite head bottle service concierge who delivered all service with a smile. Thumbs up to her!

Gotta take down a star for some MAJOR disorganized bottle service managers. Too many customer service FAILS to overlook. For calling ahead and booking bottles I expected better - especially from the WYNN! Still had one of the best nights of my life here...",2,1,2

What's EPIC? You walk in to a club and you see everyone with their hands up in the air AND frothing at the mouth with intensity. That's epic - that's partying. 

You just don't get that at XS.  At XS, you see a lot of people wandering around, and they look sort of bored.  They are there to be seen and\/or to say ""I went to XS.""   Not much drinking going on either.  I don't know what it is.. perhaps too many tourists? drinks too expensive? Fear of spilling the expensive outfit you have on?

First time here, I got kicked out for throwing up in the restroom (drank a bit too much, I know.) The lady escorted me and my friends out, but she said once I sobered up, I was able to reenter the club again. Yay! It was during MDW 2015 for David Guetta too.  

Second time was for Kaskade in December 2014. My friends and I were trying to go indoors, but apparently you need 3 stamps (people who bought tickets), we only got 2. Once we found that out, we were trying to leave the line, but the bouncers kept pushing us and other people. Not only that, they were cussing at us. Seriously uncalled for. 

Third time was for Zedd in January 2015. These were for the bouncers in the beginning. They took my friends ID because it wasn't her. Really? How is it not her when she showed them proof? They even threaten to call the police. Be Careful of the Asian bouncer -__-. Horrible to his own people. 

Other than the bouncers, everything else is good. Venue is awesome, plus ladies get complimentary drinks. Not only that, you can be in the pool if you want. I never got kicked out when I jumped in with my friends during MDW.

I've been to Omnia and while the sound quality was good, cool chandelier, and awesome lineup, it doesn't even compare to XS. Here's why: 1. Bouncers, security, check-in people, bartenders, etc. were SO FRIENDLY. I get that people get rowdy at clubs but at Omnia I constantly felt pushed around with attitude, and would get snarky answers for asking if I was in the right line. Speaking of lines-2. Yes, my party (2 sassy boys, 1 girl, me) got there around 11 so there were quite a few people waiting, but the waiting area was clean, well lit, and organized. No moving from line to line in a smoke filled casino. 3. The club was beautiful-lighting was great and varied with Alesso headlining, and there were beautiful people everywhere. No joke-I think the hottest people in Vegas got glamed up and came to XS. 4. Even though XS wasn't huge, the doors were open to the pool area which gave a nice breeze\/aka no nasty cigarette smoke lingering, and there was plenty of leaning space for my tired feet and to rest a drink. 

One thing I didn't like as much was the speaker arrangement-while the sound quality was great I couldn't speak to my friends without yelling-other clubs have gone more high tech so that you can still talk to your friends with the speakers up higher. I definitely woke up with my ears still ringing.

I'm from NY so I don't get to visit Las Vegas much, but when I do there's a few places I like to visit and XS is now on the top of my list.

While the dance floor can get a bit crowded and the drinks are a tad overpriced, the club hosts the latest artists and DJs which make up for its downfalls. Security was also friendly the night we visited and got us in quick. Inside, the dance floor was quite large which made it easier to move around without feeling overly crowded like at other clubs. While we didn't get a table this time around we did envy those at the tables surrounding the dance floor. I'll definitely have to shell out a few bucks on bottle service next time.

Drinks were expensive, but that was expected.  $8 bottled water is a little shocking though.  

All in all, I absolutely love this place!  Bottle service is the way to go, especially once the drinks kick in and people in your party want to get their dance on @ the elevated areas around the seats & not to mention dancing poles.  Last month a few girl friends and I went out and got comp'd a nice bottle of champagne (awesome to have friends in the local industry!) nicely paired w\/ strawberries at our table.  Always better to have a table to have somewhere to sit at clubs in Vegas.  Actually, it's just better to be a female in Vegas...

My only complaints are that even with bottle service, wait times can be crucial! (Probably wouldn't have that problem if we wore skirts... no offense ladies, just stating the obvious of nightlife etiquette.  understandable); the VIP cabanas are perfect if you want to wild' out exclusively with your private party but if you plan on cradling your drink and mingling as patrons walk pass then forget it because the security crew is constantly clearing the walkway by the rails even though it's spacious enough for other guests to walk by.

I've been to this place more than once. Was there a little over a week ago with some buddies. We paid over $2,200 for bottle service. Got a bottle of Crown Royal and a couple of bottles of basic vodka. 

While walking down the hallway to wait in line (we got there a little early), one of the bouncers said, ""Don't stand in MY HALLWAY or I'm gonna kick you out!"" I guess the hallway belonged to him. Other bouncers there weren't nice either. That's Vegas, though. It's all about supply and demand.

The server that we got was kind of nice. She didn't smile too much, though, and at times, seemed like she was rather annoyed that she had to serve us. 

Aside from horrible service, we had a decent time. The place was packed. So packed, in fact, that we couldn't get back inside once we went outside (they closed the off, we were seated outside).

I'd say don't get bottle service and pay $50 (I think that's the price for guys) to get in. Once you're in, you can be a squatter and just sit on other peoples chairs or cabanas or whater.

My only complaints: 
The bars are placed terribly. There's no room to walk past and there's no sense of order, so its literally a free for all to get a bartender's attention and get served.

How can it get better than walking into a lavish nightclub that features a 5 story waterfall?

Somehow it does with XS.  As John Eric S. says, ""a gyrating pleasure dome"" describes this place perfectly. This club is the epitome of opulence.  A gold theme everywhere, all the way down to the gold straws in your drink.  The layout is pretty much identical to Tryst, the only difference being the large pool surrounded by lavish cabana rooms where the waterfall would be.  There are strip poles at every table, and naturally the pole dancing competitions ensue nightly, so guys: bring some 1's (or 20's like a lot of the guys here) for the ladies!!!

The hottest new club in Vegas.  I'm scared for the upcoming summer parties here...Rehab, watch your back.

However, as is the case with most club hosts in Las Vegas, getting a good, solid table here can prove to be difficult.

These cavemen act like they are secret service agents for the President. The music was typical top 40 mixed in with techno; just turn your radio on, you will hear everything there. I did like the fact that they had blackjack tables which were a nice addition, and the outdoor pool was pretty cool. All in all it was an OK experience, nothing special to me other than the decor was cool. I could care less for the egotistical people and the long lines.",1,0,0

Yesterday, my friends and I went to this club to celebrate a few birthdays, including my own. I could tell none of the employees were prepared for the night. I kept seeing people running out heaters for the people who ordered bottle service which almost ran my friend over. 

So not only were my friends and I FREEZING but there was NO dance floor and we were required to keep walking around a pool to ""keep us moving"" away from the heaters the VIP's were using. 

Although we were the ones being pushed by arrogant men the bouncer still told us to ""move along"" and did not want to hear us out. 

So after not even an hour of being there my group of 16 friends, pissed, annoyed, and cold decided to leave this ""club"" if you'd even call it that since it had no dance floor.",7,3,1

Rich people pay $$$$ while not receiving the adequate service because most of the staff are not qualified to serve A+++ clientele .

First at the door they ask to take your Credit Card & Your passport and they keep it with them until the end of the night, when you have to pay the bill. So to start with they accuse there clientele who are spending big $$$$$ that they don't trust them paying the bill.

I will never go back to this place and do not advise people who are spending thousands of $ to go there.

I reserved a table and paid over $5000, when I went out to smoke a cigar on the pool area, they would't allow me to get back to the inside. I had to wait for 45 minutes in the cold while my jacket and wallet was inside, returning to the table I found my 3 bottle of Whisky, Champagne and Vodka totally empty, strangers where sitting on my table finishing my drinks.

If the capacity of the club is 2000 people, they put 4000 inside, and if it happens you leave your table as I did for fresh air in the pool or smoking, you loose your right to get back inside, all the stamps you have on your hand are useless, the bouncers look at your hand and says it doesn't matter, all of the people waiting outside also have tables inside, so it is not a mistake, they are doing it with everybody ...and remember you can't do anything about it because they have your passport and your credit card..

So you have to wait for as long as they want to get you back in, enough time to find that you lost all the drinks that were on your table. So what would you do, buying more bottles or just leave and promising yourself not ever to go back to that place.

Forgot to say when I complained and told them that they will end up losing there business if they continue doing so, the answer I received they don't care they are always Full!!!

So this is nothing to compare with Pure or other night clubs in Vegas!!! 
It is a nice place for girls who want to get complimentary drinks and free tickets etc but not for spending $$$$.....Believe me DONT GO!!",1,0,0

So it's a pain to get in especially for guys (expect to get a table).  But once in it's pretty fun.  Expect literally every single guy w an earpiece to try to hit u up for a 150 to 300 tip for a better table location.  Else they will relegate u to the ""least"" desirable table they can find for not following the ""rules"".  They've apparently unionized bribing, so don't expect to find a weakest link. 

Summer better bc they open up the outside so it doesn't get stiflingly crowded inside. If u bring\/wear a swimsuit in summertime, u can enter the pool all night long.  Now if u strip down to your boxers and enter pool it will take abt an hour for them to notice.  Empirical evidence suggests they will sternly ask u to rerobe vs asking u to leave, such is the nice treatment afforded bottle paying customers. 

Now if the night has winded down and u r still hankering for more, it would not behoove u to duck under an empty bar and fix urself, along w any other passing guests, a drink.  Their earpieced maroon blazers will find u w surprising alacrity (yes, alacrity).  U would likely find urself in a brightly lit waiting area w other misfits and if u play ur cards right nothing more than a stern spanking.

The place is effing gorgeous. Everything is grand and opulent, it is everything you should expect from Steve Wynn's newest hottest nightclub.

We didn't even walk through the inside section, but by the time it filled up, we wouldn't have been able to, and I was glad, it was way too packed. I like that people can spread out and the is still space to move, and that it has such large outdoor space, it feels good to breath non-sweaty air. 

Even though we got right in with pre-sale tix ($20\/female), there is something about being here that is annoying. Almost feels like you are on a serving platter.

I would have been soooo pissed if David Guetta just didn't show up. Thank goodness he did, and he was super great (the reason why I gave the place two stars).

Another thing to keep in mind is, this is Las Vegas. So be prepared to see any sort of rude people here...I live in Vegas but seldom come near the strip so I forgot how crazy people get on the strip. I doubt XS controls how many people get on the dance floor (like Marquee does), because it was absolutely SUPER DUPER packed! AND there were smokers all over the dance floor (cigarettes and weed).

Time: Saturday, after midnight
Guaranteed: a Great time!

How to get in:
If you are a girl, getting in is a breeze! There were 2 full rooms of lines, I repeat, 2 rooms! I was in a group of girls. So after lining up for about 25 mins (still staying in the 2nd room), we were asked to step to the fast line meaning straight to the cashier and to the club! If you are in a mixed group or group of guys, have fun waiting in line. Maybe make some new friends while wait? 

Venue: It was huge but packed! I was like in a maze of humans and trying to find my way out to the pool. The indoor\/outdoor thing is kind of cool. They even have some gaming tables to play. I was surprised the outside was not hot at all...I wonder how they keep it cool. The design theme is supposed to be a female body, so expect to navigate in a slightly curved space plan and see some nude sculptures hanging on the walls. Seating is plenty and bouncers are not obnoxious at all, they won't yell at you if you sit down at tables. But if it does happen, just go dip your feet in the pool. I saw many girls doing just that.

Drinks: The bartender was a little bit slow but I was in my happy mood. As long as I got acknowledged that I would be served soon, I was fine. I had LA water and it was big and strong, compared to those served at other clubs. 

Dance floor: It is fairly large (my cab driver told me it's the largest one thus far in vegas?). Great visual on the big screens around the stage. Lighting pumps with the music and they use coffetti canon instead of the CO2 canon which I hate.

Music: IT WAS AWESOME! Diplo was the headliner but he didn't start spinning until 1 or 1:30. The guy before him was kinda blah, but once Diplo started, I couldn't stop dancing! 

Crowd: I would say... there were a lot of men. I think the ratio was like 10 men to 1 woman. It was crazy. Thank God most of them were not obnoxious or fratty. Those I met were classy.

Bonus tip: Apparently, if you are in a group of guys and would like some girls at your table, the bouncers would go out of their way to bring girls back. Pretty is not guaranteed though based on my observation.",5,2,3

If I didn't have this unfortunate dealing with kalani, XS would've probably gotten 5 stars from me.  The Club is very nice, outdoor pool area and table games is nice, music was cool, crowd was cool.  

Not much negative to say about the club itself besides the fact that it was SUPER Packed, but hey, its supposed to be one of the most poppin clubs in vegas so I can't complain about this too much.  

Here's the deal with Kalani.  I had reserved a table with 3 bottles for me and my buddies through a promoter.  He passed on my info to Kalani and I got a text the day before confirming the table and our price minimum.  I responded quickly to confirm and he says make sure were there by 10:30 and to call him when we arrive.  So far so good.

Anyways, we get there early, around 10.  I call him and communication is pretty horrible, not his fault, it was loud and there was already a long line.  He says come to the front of the general admission line.  I look for him for a while and after some confusion we finally meet up.  He tells another host to take care of my group so we go through and pass the entire line and get let into the club.  So far so good.

Now, were in front of the cashier and my friends are just waiting for me since I'm organizing all of this.  Keep in mind, this is my first time trying to get a table in vegas.  So one of my buddies asks if I got a receipt slip from Kalani, i didn't, so i go back out and ask kalani what were supposed to do.  He finishes helping the dude before us and starts writing on the receipt slip and communicating with his ear piece.  

He repeats my name into his mic and proceeds to say ""His name is Sennett, s-e-n-n-e-t-t, he's in the system"".  And a minute later, he looks over and says, sorry man they don't have your table.  

I look at him with a perplexed look and say, ""what?, what are you talking about"".  

ANYWAYS... He proceeds to tell me and my group to pay the cover to get in, and that a table should open up in an hour and that he would reimburse our cover and give us our originally agreed upon table minimum.  He says he will stay in contact with me via text.  

At that point, I realized that we had just gotten fucked over and that we weren't getting a table.  I felt bad and responsible for me and my friends not getting a table.  We paid the cover and got in and of course did not hear anything back from Kalani.  

Ended up still having a pretty good time but that started our night off at XS in a sour manner...",9,3,1

I went to XS at the beginning of June with 13 other girls including fellow yelper, Angelica C. (See her review below!)  We had heard all the hype about XS from friends that had gone for spring break that we just had  to make XS our last Las Vegas club adventure.

My review, like my experience at XS must be viewed through the eyes of a drunk 22 year-old woman on her first Las Vegas adventure. 

XS was crazy packed with soooo many people, a bar everywhere you turn, and an amazing pool! The music was great the whole night. The lines for the bathrooms weren't too bad. Paris Hilton was there and so were Lil Jon and Too Short.

I can't say much because I was totally inebriated but if you find yourself in Las Vegas, get yourself to XS! 

Oh and bring a bunch of girls with you! We got in for my favorite price of FREEEEEEE!",2,5,1

This is an excellent nightclub! One of, if not THE best, in vegas! The line outside moved fast, bouncers were nice, drinks were average, and I LOVED the outside area! It made the club feel so spacious! I actually had room to move around and dance instead of bumping into nasty, sweaty people everytime I moved. The decor is great, the music was good, and the people were actually good too! 

We did go onto the dancefloor for a quick minute but we liked it outside way better. We didnt even have bottle service but still felt like the exerpience was grand. Got to dip our feet in the pool and stayed there dancing all night through. It was soo relaxing, I think that is what made my night. 

Bartenders were actually nice. I bought 4 drinks for about $60 (including tip)- Vodka cranberry, adios, mai tai, and redbull vodka. 

Also a plus: as soon as I walked in, I could feel the a\/c blowing! It didnt have the stuffy feeling most clubs do. It felt cool in there, not hot and gross with the smell of sweat! It was great!

Only thing I didnt like was the cover. =[ so .5 off for that",0,0,0

I would say 2-3 women to every man. At one point I **couldn't even see** one man in any direction!!!  I'm taken and not looking, but still, it was a little ridiculous. 

It's also packed to the brim to the point where you can't even move...NOT my idea of a good time. Ladies: I recommend Surrender or Marquee. Guys: go here, you hit the jackpot! 

And if you're a girl w\/ only girls, get on the list with a promoter & you can get in free.",2,0,0

XS has this and more. I promise. Okay, so I'd never drop that kind of money on something you'd pee out 10 minutes later. Even if I DID make millions, I just wouldn't bc of the shear principle.

I was lucky enough to be w\/some folks w\/a little cheese and DID get to experience bottle service at our very own table. It did truly rock, I must say.

This club is so hedonistic, I just love it. Music is on-point and sound system is perfect. I've been here 3 times and I'd go back. Did see Kanye West here in 2010. Not a fan of him as a person but do like some of his music.

The fact that it opens up to a beautiful pool area in the back pushes it over the 3-star mark. They played a good mix of music, although later on it got a little too heavy on the techno\/dance stuff which seems to be normal for Vegas.

I really don't like the 1 hour wait and how unorganized they are with the guestlist. My friend's boyfriend put us on the guestlist and we couldn't find the promoter that was in charge of it so it was frustrating! $50 for guys and $20 for girls.

The place was packed beyond crazy. There was literally no room to move on the dance floor at all.

The reason why I like Marquee better is because they have confetti, steam, laser effects, dancers with crazy costumes on, and glowstick distribution everywhere- XS did not have any of these except the few glowsticks. 

Oh and somebody gave us their table because they were leaving and the b**** bottle service girl kicked us out even though she was off for the night. Anyways, not as fun as Marquee.",6,2,1

Girls get free entry and free drink tickets. I'm not sure what the policy is with guys.

Chris Cowette was a great promoter (702-722-8585). He was reliable. In addition to helping me with XS, he also got me in touch with promoters who work for other clubs when I asked.

The line for the club can get pretty long but if your with the right people or bring a drink with you in line, time can go by pretty fast. I think the longest I waited in line was about 20 minutes. When you go inside, the dance floor is right in the middle, it's a decent sized but can get crowded at times. There's also an outside area, which is awesome!! Ladies, once your feet hurt, you can soak your feet in the pool and dance in it also!! 
The only thing that I don't like about XS is that the majority of the music is house, which I can't stand. If your pretty messed, you'll probably have a good time because you won't even notice what music is playing. But if you can't stand house music, you probably don't want to come here. There will be random times when they'll play a hip-hop song but that's once in every 15 songs or so. 
Cover isn't too bad girls, it's $20, but if you talk to someone about the guestlist, girls can get in for free. For guys, cover is pretty pricey, it's $50! 
Overall, I think that everyone should go to XS at least once when they go to Vegas, its a really nice club, but the only thing is the house music. But if your a fan of it, then you're gonna love this club!",0,0,0

Outside pool area is nice to get away from the crowd on the dancefloor, but you don't get the same sound\/lighting experience, which is amazing. On the other side of the pool is the gambling area. They have blackjack and not sure what else.

The layout of the venue is great and I especially love the outdoor area; it's beautiful and even has a bar and tables set up for gamblers. But be careful not to get too schwasted and fall in the pool...

Lines can get long so try to get there a little earlier. Contact a promoter to get you and your friends on the guest list to avoid paying a ridiculous cover fee. The ratio of females to males must be even in order for your group to qualify for the ""free"" pass.

The last time I went, my friends and I (4 girls, 3 guys) got in for free, but only had access to the outdoor area... weird. There was a cover fee to get inside ($25\/girl and $55\/guy) but we hustled the bouncers and managed to get all the girls in free of charge. The guys, unfortunately, ended up having to hand over $100 for all three of them to get inside. But hey, better than $55 per person, right?

The only con is that the indoor space usually fills up as the night progresses and people start getting pushy especially for a better known DJ. Other than that, if you are looking for a good time XS is hands down where you want to be!

On one occasion I went through a promoter and was able to go to Tryst then XS free of charge. On another occasion there was a promoter who was able to get my friends and I into XS without cover and we were also able to skip the long line.

Pro Tip: Try going through a promoter if you can to avoid long lines and any fees. The only con is having to get to the venue earlier.",2,1,0

Awesome club, the wait was about to be bad but flirted the way in (I was glad guy friends about 15 people behind us decided to not cut line to where we were when we offered bc that would not have been possible with 2 guys).

$20 cover, not bad.  

My favorite part of the club was outside by the pool, you can take your heels off without worrying about getting your feet dirty, broken articles on the floor, etc.  Gigantic screen of DJ doing his thing for the folks hanging outside.  Music is loud enough for people outside.  Not a good mix of music however, they were playing trans\/house, what I call ecstasy music all night (well, during the peak hours, 11-3:30).  I cannot dance to this type of music other than swinging my arms in the air or jumping up and down.

Service at bar is nice and fast, short\/long enough when guys buy you drinks if you know what I mean ;)

Around 3:30 or so, we were done.  Got some pizza at the bar inside the hotel and went outside to catch a cab to Paris Hotel.  There was an HOUR wait at the taxi line.  We ended up getting one of those private car services which costs $45 (not including tip) for a 15 minute ride.",0,0,0

The first time I saw at XS in writing, I couldn't understand the appeal of an ""extra small"" club.  It was only after a few people said it out loud did I understand idea. Muhaha, I get it now.  

XS is THE SPOT right now. Arriving on a Saturday night, we were pushed and horded through dozens and dozens of hopefuls...eyes were staring down on you as you move through the ropes...people were so antsy that they were ready to throw punches.  A polite ""excuse me"" that usually gets me a ticket in did absolutely nothing next to the money-hungry, power-tripping doorman.  We remained in good spirits hoping that somehow we can get in.  I must have saw 20 guys slip one of the door guys a stack of benjamins.. ""you guys still have to pay cover, it's $30"" he said.

Huff puff and 20 minutes later, our local girlfriend managed to get 8 of us through the ropes and somehow amazingly, without cover.  Punches were almost thrown while others tried to get in. Yikes..

The locals say that XS was the next Tryst, except bigger and better.  I stepped through the ropes hoping to see a GINORMOUS waterfall...turns out there isn't one but I wasn't disappointed at all!  The club is absolutely hot.  While the dance floor mimicked the set up of Tryst's interior, the outdoor opens up to a circular pool, bars, 2 levels of cabanas and tons of white cushions with tables by the pool.  It was unimaginable just how big and gorgeous the venue was...I don't even think we ever made it all the way around.

The crowd was hot, the music was bumping...and even though it couldn't have been more than 50 degrees outside, we could not get ourselves to leave. I can go on and on, but it was worth every bit of painfulness (soooo crowded that people will knee you to get by) and every spill (some guy splashed a girl in the face [and my back] with a drink before someone punched him).  You can't help but laugh when a drunk girl exits out of the club and takes down 5 divider ropes with her while she stumbles. Ah...Vegas...

I'm definitely intimidated to come back, since my girls and I hate paying for cover and waiting in line..but it is worth everything it's cut out to be.  Hopefully the next club will open up soon, the crowd will move over, and me and XS can get some serious quality time together.",1,2,5

This place is GINORMOUS. One must experience it just to see what the hype is about.  And the hype is true, it is beautiful inside. 

What sets it apart from all the rest is the HUGE space outdoors to relax and give yourself some breathing room (hard to find at any Vegas club).  The outdoors comes fully equipped with gambling tables, a pool, a bar, and an actual place to SIT DOWN. Nice.

Why the 2 star rating?  SERVICE, SERVICE, SERVICE.  It is AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL. Service can make or break your experience and sadly, it broke it for us.

We understand that any club's intention is to pack everyone in there like a meat market but this one takes the cake on rushing people in like a herd of sheep without common courtesy.  It's pathetic.  

What's even more pathetic is how the doormen treat you.  Ok, maybe I shouldn't generalize...it's how one particular host treated us and his name is KERRY MCKENNA.  DO NOT GO TO THIS GUY FOR TABLE SERVICE, BOTTLE SERVICE or any kind of service. He is RUDE, and has a god-almighty complex.  He lacks common courtesy, people skills and just plain respect for people.  He made the experience at XS as unpleasant as the techno music they played ALL NIGHT LONG.  Yes, I said ugly techno music all night long.

I mostly sat outside on one of those lounge bed thingies in the pool and just effing loved life. Honestly it was just sooooo chill. However, there was this cute Australian guy out there and we danced a little with our feet in the water. One highlight: him saying ""I don't dance... I boogie."" Lololol love it. 

Like so many Vegas clubs, it seems, the dance floor was a mess. I liked the idea\/setup of it, but you could hardly groove for 3 seconds before someone bumped into you, shoved past you, or knocked you off-balance. Which is a little awkward and unfortunate when you're trying to dance with a guy. It's really not conducive to any kind of sexy times at all.

But the worst part (for me) was leaving the dance floor to go out back for the first time because there was literally a row of men leaning against this railing like they were just WAITING to be creepy. I immediately diverted my eyes, but of course, what would Vegas be without various audacious men who try to grab you as you walk by?

XS located at the Wynn\/Encore is definitely one of my favorites. I've seen Kaskade, David Guetta, Diplo, and Alesso numerous times for free! XS is by far, the most stunning and beautiful club out here. It has a beautiful outdoors area with a pool as well. This club is visually impressive and worth checking out even if you aren't a club goer. Even the bathroom is a sight! The vibe is always awesome as well. Everyone just wants to have a good time and I have never run into any drama the numerous times I've been here. The crowd is racially mixed and mostly young (mid twenties or so). You can't help but notice that there are a lot of attractive people as well. I have noticed that XS isn't as popular as it was compared to several years ago. It isn't as packed and the lines are not as ridiculously long. People are a bit less hot. Whether that is a good or bad thing depends on you. I personally do not want to wait in line for an hour plus to get into any club and I hate being packed like sardines.

I don't ever do bottle service or tables as it is way too expensive and I can't justify the spending therefore I can't give you any advice or experiences related to that topic. I usually go out with a friend or 2 at the most and not in very large group. If we need to sit, there are a few areas outdoors where you can sit for free. We don't find guys with tables to sit with because we are all in relationships lol but that is another option for you ladies. Females are given free entrance into any club here by getting on the guestlist. Like many of the other reviews, I always use Rachel without fail. The guestlist line moves pretty fast if you arrive by 11.  Just a warning that it can be a different ball game if you attempt to come with men through the guestlist. The allowed ratio is 1 male:1 female but during bigger events (ie.holiday weekends), men may not be allowed entrance through the guestlist at all. They may have to go through general admissions, wait in a different line, and pay full price. You are also given two free drinks tickets that are good until midnight. The drinks may be free but always tip your bartender.

I read some complaints about guestlist people not being able to enter the indoors portion of the club. I've never had any problems with that including on major holidays and I've never bribed security but I have a theory based on my observation. Don't shoot the messenger but I have noticed that if you are rude, too intoxicated, or on the unattractive side, security is less likely to let you through. It's shallow but it is Vegas. Dress your best ladies, groom yourself, and don't be too drunk before you get into that line. 

Now the cons because there are a few. Usually, the main act\/DJ do not show up until 2AM. I'm not a senior citizen by any means but my weekly partying days are over. Some of the other clubs have their guy out by 1AM at the latest. Another problem is the size of the indoors dance floor. They need to renovate and expand it so that people can at least move a bit. I've seen the dance floor get so shoulder to shoulder crowded that security rope it off and refuse to let anyone enter it for a while. 

My opinion about security (I'm going to give my 2 cents about them since everybody is doing it too) . Over the past year, they have improved.  My guess is that business have slowed down with the opening of Omnia so they are doing what they can to have us return. I've never had any terrible experiences with security but there is a very rude lady who works in the guestlist area. If you politely ask her any questions, she snaps at you. lol I don't know her name but she is a short Asian woman. She is about 5'2 and is possibly Filipino.  I know it is tough working with young, drunk tourists but it isn't an excuse to be rude to people for no reason.     

 If you come here during the winter season, the outdoors area may be closed so you will not get to experience XS wholly. I truly feel that the outdoors area is what makes this club unique so you may be disappointed. 

I've never had anything stolen here. Maybe I've just been extremely lucky. As a local, I have not heard anything about thefts here being an inside job but who knows, anything is possible. This city isn't exactly known for having morals. lol My advice is to always keep your purse in front of you where you can see it, not to your side, your hip, or behind you. If possible, buy a purse that has an additional zip up compartment inside that is large enough for your wallet and phone and use it at any club here even if it's ugly.",1,1,1

I've never had to wait in the line, which is the reason I'm sure some people would not rate the club highly.  But even if you do have to wait a bit, once you get inside it's great.  There are inside and outside areas, and you're bound to meet some great people.  Everyone is pretty cool and attractive and I've only felt a bit creeped out once (and that was because my friend was really drunk and some guy was ""helping"").

Pros:
1. Very good DJ, music selection, lights, and sounds.
2. Beautiful architecture and views.
3. Many beautiful ladies. 
Cons:
1. Dance floor is too small so it got too crowded. 
2. People keep bumping you while walking in\/out of crowded floor. Breaks your rhythm. 
3. Many people just stand\/walk. This is a Dance club; Not a Stand club. If you're not dancing, please go to pool area. Here people can listen to each other, introduce themselves, and then decide to dance. If not, there are plenty of fish in the sea.
4. Management denied access to outdoor pool area to get fresh air, talk, and maybe dance outside. 
5. Bouncers\/Security are rude. If you will deny access, apologize, state the reason, and smile. You only need to get tough After people don't respond to reason. Being rude is not a good Customer Service trait.

yes, bouncers are super uptight and anal, but that's any Vegas club, and this is definitely one of the nicest ones.

Don't mistake XS here for extra small.  This is just about the most over the top club I've ever stepped foot into!  And if I were to create my own club, this has all of the components I can dream of.

*Great dance floor in the middle
*Huge pool area for chit chatting outside
*Half a dozen bars, making getting drunk easy
*$12-15 drinks
*Tables right next to the action and cabanas in good areas by the pools
*Ledges available to sit on outside in the pool area
*Poles and stages available for girls to dance on
*No waits at the bar or in the restrooms

It even has amenities I wouldn't even have thought of.  Their bathrooms here have practically no wait and when you use the urinal, they have a sponge pad so you won't ever worry about that splash back (excessive, probably).  Also, while you wash your hands, one of the many bathroom attendants will roll the lint off your back and shoulders.

I have to give thanks to the DJ for putting together a great night.  The night at first was some house\/techno when the club was empty.  Then it went to a great 30 minutes of hiphop\/top 40 while we were all on the dance floor and mixed it up for the last couple hours.

Guys, come early if you want to get in.  I remember getting to the line around 9:30 and even though it was long, it rolled pretty quickly and everyone was able to get in ($30 cover).  Don't trust those passes you get from cabs though.  They most likely won't work on a busy night.  Come early and get stamps so you'll have less to worry about.

Prettier go go girls are the only thing I can think of that would improve this place.  They let me down quite a bit.  Oh and one of our friends was caught hurling in the bathroom--make sure you do this outside in the casino if you have to because those attendants are like hawks and will kick yo ass out.  We had to grease one of the attendants to let one of our girls stay in the club--nothing a little tip can't handle in Vegas it seems.

Oh and the girls in this club seem extremely friendly compared to clubs in LA.  I could just smile at a girl in passing and they'd grab an arm and smile back.  It's probably cause we're all on vacation.  Although I did talk to one girl and she said her whole sorority class dropped before coming here... so... well, I guess the guys can benefit from that.

If you come early, you'll be able to walk around the whole shebang and take it all in.  It's absolutely gorgeous.",7,5,6

- XS seems like it wants to be a hybrid club\/lounge (aka many tables, and a smaller dance floor) while Tao knows it is a night club (few tables, more space, more rooms). In the end XS does both badly while Tao works as a club. IMO XS is overrated as a club.

- Tao Cover = $20 or possibly free even for guys (see my Tao review), XS = $30 even when you get there at 9:30pm.

- No open bar, everyone pays for drinks. Tao has open bar for ladies early in the evening.

- Too may tables. XS has too many tables and only a single dance floor while Tao has the main dance floor and other rooms\/spots to chill and sit down. Sorry XS, not all of us have a grand to drop just to sit down and order your overpriced bottles of Grey Goose.

- Pure hell when crowded: ask anyone who came here last weekend (the Saturday of the weekend before Christmas 2010). Tao can get crowded but it was still ok to get from pt. A to pt. B to the bathroom for emergencies =p

- XS has a useless pool in the back. What a waste of space. Why have a pool that no one can use or relax next to in the open air? I can stare out of my window at home into my neighbor's pool if I wanted to see one used as a prop.

I definitely still recommend you come here to see if it is your cup of tea and it'll definitely give you that Vegas club experience.",5,1,1

Eventually we made our way back to the table and hung out there a little bit more. By this time it was a little past 2AM and we wanted to make one more stop before the nightclub ends so we left.

The music is ok, nothing impressive but not bad enough for me to never come back there again.

It's a clubbers' dream to party up here at XS! You've gotta venture up here to complete your Vegas trip. 

My highlights:
- I stayed at the Encore on Halloween weekend, which this club is situated in, which was SUPER CONVENIENT! It was literally only a few minutes walk from our room. 
-Beautiful women everywhere from all of the 7 continents around the world. 
-Ladies, go dip your feet into the shallow pool to wade on. 
-No designated drivers needed if you stay at Encore\/Wynn hotel. Go get wasted!
-No lines since we had VIP access due to our bottle service. Great bouncers! They do re-entries. 
-The music, EDM, dubstep-y, & hip-hop-ish. It was Kaskade DJ'ing on our Halloween night! I did not know who was our DJ lineup until I came in hella buzz knowing it's actually Kaskade playing.
-Our stunning $1,000+ table on a cabana with comfortable couch with cushions by the celestial waters! Seriously, GET A BOTTLE SERVICE! If you have money to blow for a table, get one. Gentlemen, ladies will come up to you like a magnet if you get a bottle service\/table for them to sit next to you. Worth the investment. After all, it's Las Vegas and money ain't a thing! 

Negative aspects: 
-Expensive. Just be prepared to have money to blow! I saw a special Dom Perignon 6L bottle for $25,000! Oh my goodness. It's on their menu. We stick with the Hennessy Privilegé, LOL.

I had always wanted to check out XS bc I heard it was the best of the best, especially in terms of atmosphere but for the night we were there, Guetta was at XS and the last time I saw him he was terrible. At the last minute, we shifted plans though, because someone we knew got  a table at XS which ironically was where I had first wanted to check out. I am SO glad we switched plans. XS is amazing. Every detail in terms of decoration (as is in all of Encore and Wynn) is thought out and well positioned. I know people are saying it's crowded but I expected that at any club and from what I've heard you literally cannot move in Hakkasan. I can confidently say that the night David Guetta was XS, though crowded, you could comfortably get around. To my surprise, Guetta did a much better performance at XS than the last time I saw him (music fest a couple years back) so that was a pleasant surprise. Our bottle waitresses (two blondes) were really nice, and they got some stragglers who were in our table area away so we appreciated that. I have to admit, we met a lot of awesome people at XS. I found the crowd overall to be very friendly, everyone was there to have a good time. XS you have won me over. If you're only in town for a short period of time and are stuck between Hakkasan and XS like we were.... I'll make it easy for you, do XS. You won't regret it.

Dead clubs are not  appealing. Drinks are normal priced for clubs ~$10. Entrance for men $30, Women $20.

CAUTION: If you don't have bottle service, you will want to stand in line 30-60 minutes PRIOR to the club opening. Otherwise, you may end up waiting in line for 2 hours unless you are with insanely beautiful women, or if you tip them $100 at the door. Just FYI.

The venue is immense. There is a huge outdoor pool area with high stakes gambling, a large dance floor, and a ton of cabanas to hang out in. Outdoors is a very chill place to just hang out and catch up with old friends, while inside is insane with tons of dancing and lots of people.

Anyway, this venue is a lot of fun.

Our group pre paid for our tickets to get into the club. We waited for over an hour to get in, arriving at 10:00pm, and once we got inside the club it was downhill from there. I really did expect to wait to get into this club, so that really wasn't an issue for me. 

It was once inside the club that became a disaster, and I will be talking to the Nevada Fire Marshall about my experience. From the moment we entered the club, it was literally so crowded you could not move anywhere. You couldn't even raise your arms because you were so tightly squeezed together it was impossible to move! We tried to make our way to the first bar, and there was no way anyone was going to get a drink, let alone even get to the front of the bar to order!

We then tried to make our way to the dance floor and was stopped by a very large African American bouncer. He was stopping the flow of traffic onto the dance floor and every 5 minutes would push the entire crowd back, some of the people almost going under and getting trampled with the crowd being so large. If any fire would have broken out, the majority of the people in that club would have died! The training of the bouncer to just arbitrarily push the entire crowd back and not care that shorter girls were going under and possibly being trampled is completely unacceptable for a club at the Wynn Casino.

After spending just 45 minutes in the club, being pushed, shoved, kicked, stepped on, grabbed, punched and spit on, we decided to leave. More training of the XS club bouncers need to happen, and a closer watch on what the club capacity is should be closely monitored. One of these days, something is going to happen and there will be massive amount of people being trampled at this club.",1,1,0

As you walk in, the club just keeps getting bigger and wider!  its amazing!  the club is huge. 1 huge indoor seating area, dance floor and stripper poles situated throughout the club. There are  2 floors outdoors and a gorgeous European style pool with several lounge beds in the water. I really like the fact that XS has places for people to sit without having to pay over a grand for a table!  the poolside lounge beds are free and they are really nice.  They could easily charge people to pay to sit there, but they don't!  
    For you gamblers out there they have a designated area by the pool for you to gamble.  you probably want to stay away from there when you are drunk!!!  
    My friends got a table by the pool and bottle service was $1200 for 6 people, a bottle of jack and a bottle of grey goose.  We actually had 11 guys 9 girls, but the rest of us got in very easily considering we went on a Friday night.  There wasn't really anyone when we got there at around 10 ish.  i waited in line for a couple of minutes and was in! girls pay $20 guys $30.  
     I definitely want to go back again just to see the whole place and probably sit somewhere else for a different view!  the poolside tables are really nice though!!  i highly recommend it!!",4,3,4

Cover:
Guys: $30
Ladies: $20  

Wait from the back of the line: 45 minutes.  

Pros: 
Giant, giant club.  GIANT!
Clean restrooms :)
Friendly bartenders  
Pools outside, open air and more space
Crazy mash-ups
Live performance: Too Short
Well ventilated, for a crowded club
You can sit on the pool loungers ... for free! (gasp - usu. have to pay to sit down in a club!)
Mostly beautiful people

Cons: 
Pricey Drinks (as expected): $12 (shots), $15+ cocktails
Please note: drinks are cheaper outside at the pool bar, but bar inside is less of a wait
Extremely crowded inside - lots of smashing\/pushing
Staff kicked us off one of the the beds when we had to sit and put our shoes back on (it was reserved), but was very friendly about it. (pro?)

I wanted to see what the hype was about since it's been dubbed the hottest, best club in life ever. I went on Christmas Day with my sister. There was a line that was relatively short for XS. We got in line and surprisingly right when we got in line the guy was already checking ID's to go in. Overall between going to the back of the line and stepping foot in the club it was about 10 mintues, not too bad, I was expecting longer. We each paid $20 (grrr) but I guess it's pretty standard for this club that even girls have to pay, which sucks. They lie and say they only have guest lists for Sunday and Monday even though in the past I was on a guest list on a Saturday but I didn't actually go to the club though, so I know that they do have guest lists through promoters.

Anyhoo, the club is like Tryst x10. Very beautiful of course. The music was mostly house\/dance type music that I wasn't too fond of even though there was a sprinkle of hip hop which made me happy. The club was packed even on Christmas Day, so it made me feel better that I was clubbin on what is basically a family holiday! But heck, my parents were in bed anyway!

Not sure if I would go back, because in essence I just wanted to see what the hype was about. I prefer Tryst personally and would rather go there since it was free and I like the music (Top 40\/hip hop mix) better there.",2,0,1

Me and my friends were coming back and forth from the dancefloor, to our table, and then the to war  and blackjack tables. There was just a variety of things to do for everyone.

Vegas is a circus to which customers from all around the world come to leave their honestly (or not so much) earned money. Everything here is designed to pump as much cash out of customers during their visit and Vegas is really good at that. XS is not an exception and lives up to the standard of local business practices:

1. Treating customers in the line as kettle waiting in line to be milked for money. 
2. False advertising. For unlucky kettle that doesn't buy tickets in advance or choses not to pay for bottle service around $1,200 cover prices may vary. Forget about what you see on promotion - you will be charged whatever security wishes\/dares to ask. 
3. If you really want security to be nice to you - you can pay $200 cash and they will take you through the long line of customers (wondering if management knows about this).
4. Security acting like owners of the club. No offense, but there is a reason why these guys are trusted only with low quality suits and earpieces to talk to their pals about ""potential threats"" :)

Now, is it the best club in Vegas? Maybe, maybe not. In order to be one they really need to learn how to treat customers. Fancy interior, nice loud music don't matter as long as XS has those average in quality and cunning in nature ""services"".

SIKE!!! XS is ridiculously glamorous. 

I could wax all kinds of poetic about how insane this club is but... It's easier to make lists.

Pros:
1. It's a gorgeous club. Extra large, sparkling gold rotating chandelier in the center of the dance floor that'll hypnotize you, blackjack tables in the middle of the pool, AND stripper poles! (...) 
2. All the dancers are pretty little young things, in a non-ho kind of way.

5. $20 cover got our group of girls to the front of the line. 

Cons:
1. The DJ played boring music. 20 minutes of house, 20 minutes of pop, and 20 minutes of hip hop. I'm not running the treadmill at the gym, you know!
2. It's wayyy too bright in here. I think of myself as a full on Monet - from far away I'm okay, but up close I'm a big ole mess.. especially when there are drinks involved, so dim those lights please.
3. $20 cover.

Tidbits of our night out:
1. I chatted with some girl dancing on the pole and she knew how to WORK. I asked her if she was a stripper (girls can get away with asking such blunt questions) and she said no. Her day job was being a police officer. It makes me hate cops less.
2. I was walking across the dance floor and a guy pulls me aside by my arm and then belches in my ear. Wow. I was too confused to be like WTF.
3. I asked one of the guys serving our table if he wanted a drink and he declined, explaining the employees get breathalized after every shift (unlike at other clubs where table attendants can drink with partiers).
4. There were a ton of SLOPPY girls trying to get on the pole. Now, I'm not a hater and I'm definitely jealous of the go-go dancers. But there's a line between being hot and just a hot mess. These girls were boosting each other up on to the pole, and one of them even fell off... flat out fell 3 feet because she was too drunk to hold on. Hooooo, you've been flagged!

DJ: Zedd was playing that night so there was no complaints on the music aspect. I had a blast!

Major reason for the ONE STAR RATING. Lo and behold it was due to the bouncers again! This time the situation was HORRIBLE.

1.When approaching the guest list line, the bouncers already were super negative and ordered us to toss our drinks in the trash. When we tried to finish it outside they threatened us that if we did not do so that instant then we will not gain admission into the club. Who do you guys think you are, my MOM?! Even my mom doesn't tell me what to do! Besides, other clubs are okay with that why are you guys so uptight about it. Ridiculous! 

2. My friend's ID got taken away that night because they claimed that it WAS NOT HER. So now my friend has to go back to DMV and pay a fee for this. GREAT! 

3. When my friend requested to get her ID back, the bouncers threatened arrest. What is going on here... you are just a bouncer at club.. you are not law enforcement who gives you the right to arrest anyone & secondly there was no need to threaten arrest because there was no physical altercation that took place.

XS brings in a lot of DJs on Fridays and Saturdays so just check to see who might be there beforehand if you're not into house music and whatnot.

The first time I went was back in November for my 21st birthday with my small group of girlfriends on a Saturday night. We got there around 10:30 I think, and there was hardly a line.  We decided to walk to Surrender to get our hand stamps there and get free drinks before going back to XS.  We came back to XS probably about 11:30 and at that point, the line was crazy.  The bouncers pissed us off because we already told one of them that we were on the guest list, but he told us we couldn't pass the line because we had to show him a direct text message from the promoter we talked to.  So then we had to wait for about 10-15 minutes before we could reach our promoter and skip the line.  Considering that it was just a group of 4 girls, this was annoying.  

But once we got inside the club, we completely got in our zones and started dancing away with random people and had a good time.  They were playing Top40 music which I LOVE.

The only way the guys could get in was through ""greasing"" the bouncers - pay them off $100 for a group of 3 guys.  They should just one of lines - the $100 bribe line.  Inside the club isn't that awesome either.  Its a rather small room if you pact over max capacity.  I'm sure they are in violation of some kind of fire code.

I seriously don't think its worth spending your time there.  It might be better if you're with all girls but it sucks having half of your party (girls) in the club and half outside waiting in line.  This club sucks.",1,0,0

+1 cool decor and lighting. Great sound all around the venue

You really can't go wrong with coming here. Sure, like any Vegas club it will get crowded especially on the weekends but it's posh. People mostly dressed to the nines all having a great time. Music is always on par and if you're lucky to see an artist\/DJ there it's sure to be a blast.

My girlfriends and I had a great time dancing and mingling with guys. Then, without any notice, Deadmau5 came up and starting DJing. The whole club went crazy! It was one of those magic Vegas experiences that you don't forget.

Stayed at the Wynn and XS is literally around the corner from the resort elevators.  Get in line at around 9, wait half an hour, get a stamp for ins-n-outs, and go back to the room throughout the night for a free drink, yay, or a J...  whatever your poison.  Get in line after 10 and good luck getting in... some of our friends didn't.  

POOL AREA
The main reason I enjoyed this club, especially as a smoker, is the large, open-air pool area.  Luckily we found a free ""sofa-recliner"" that sits in the shallow area of the pool where you can dip your feet or lay back and watch the crowd - I suggest you grab one.  My wife and I partied, fell asleep on the recliner for an hour around 1am, woke up, grabbed another drink, had someone hold our spot, got back on the dance floor, and back to our seat until the club closed.

Bottle service tables around the pool don't seem VIP at all.  Close to impossible to get on guestlist for the average Joe.  FYI:  The table reservations line was the same length as the general admission line at around 11:30pm.

Went here on a Saturday.  They played a mix of house and hip hop.  $14 Jack and Cokes are worth it because drinks are 1.5x - 2x larger than normal.  $14 henny shots not worth it when you have some in the room.  Admission: $30 guys, $20 girls.",3,1,1

Arrived Saturday night (9.24.16), we were a group of 11 women in town from all over for a bachelorette party. We were super geeked to see David Guetta only to have our vibes killed by a bouncer who was in the mood to flex and abuse the ""power"" he has. One young lady in our group showed her passport as her proof of identification, she had just come back from traveling outside of the states and usually passports are revered as the best form of ID one can have. The bouncer asked her if she ""had lost weight"" and stated he didn't believe it was her on her passport. HOW RUDE!!!!! Yes, she had lost weight and she also had other forms of ID; credit cards, we even pulled up Facebook pictures. We were trying everything we could to prove she was who she said she was and that she was of age but the bouncer took pride in turning us down after a good 30-45 min plea and us going back and forth showing as much as we could to support her ID, all to no avail. We were more than frustrated and we're told that the rude ass bouncer was the manager and there was no one higher in rank that we could speak to. It was really ridiculous. As badly as we all wanted to give the bouncer a piece of our mind, we charged the loss to the game and kept it pushing. 

I won't ever patronize this place when in Vegas. 

We ended up at LIGHT IN MANDALAY BAY and had a blast, jammed the night away to DJ Mustard and J Cole. Thank you, Light for have courteous bouncers who've seen a passport before in their life and understand how to prove identity.",13,4,5

The music is really good, you can hear it all the way from outside.

Getting into the club is pretty crazy, unless you got awesome promoters that will just wakl you in. If not, the line gets pretty ridiculous. So make some calls and get in fast bc it is definitely worth it!

The only downside would be the bar service which takes forever and a fricken day to serve you. Your best best is to find those server girls wearing all gold carrying around shots. That is the best way to get drinks bc they keep coming back to you if you tip them well. Super nice too!

But night two of my bachelorette party was not the time to experiment - we stuck to our guns, and the night was great while it lasted.

I don't like clubbing in L.A., but for some reason Vegas clubbing is pretty enjoyable.  Even though half the XS crowd is from Los Angeles, the composition is lighter on the every-Friday-with-my-boys sort than the Hollywood crowd, with a lot more repressed professionals cramming one weekend with moderate misbehavior.  I've been back to XS a couple times since 2009 (with my repressed professional friends), and it's my favorite club in Vegas.  I like the open layout, and the interior is really good-looking.  The music is good, and the club doesn't feel too cramped even when it's crawling with people.

When we came for my bachelorette party, our friend Jason W. hooked us up and got us in for free.  He then bought us (all nine of us!) a round of shots, so thank you Jason for showing us a good time!  I was wearing a white dress and a tiara and all that, and I remember at least one stranger buying me a shot, too.  It all gets kind of hazy after that - I'd pounded a full cup of Jack and green tea in the hotel room, while my friends admonished me for not drinking fast enough.

In my memory, we were at XS for all of thirty minutes before I got sick and had to go home.  In reality, I guess we were there for a while.  There's iPhone footage of me and my old roommate standing in the pool and dancing, but that is the only evidence I've logged of that part of the evening.  I do remember snippets of my demise - on my knees in the bathroom, balled up in the cab line - but otherwise I just know that I woke up feeling awful, wearing pajamas, fake eyelashes, and a garter.  It was only then that I learned of the other casualties of the night.  Two of my friends had also gotten sick, including the one who was most responsible for my care - she held my hair, put me to bed, then puked at seven in the morning.  One of my friends cracked her phone, and another lost hers in a cab.  The drive back to L.A. was, uh, pretty rough.

If you tally the lost phones and damaged dignity, I guess you can't say our night at XS was free, but we paid nothing to the club and got a lot in return.  We had a fantastic time, and it was a great way to end a perfect bachelorette weekend.",7,20,8

We were on the guestlist, so we had to get there before 10:30 pm, but it was fine, especially since we got free entry and free drink tickets. Even the guys in our group got in free and our ratio was only 3:2. We waited in a line for a bit, then our promoter came and got us and told us to go to the head of the line (ahead of a lot of other people who had been waiting) and we just walked right into the club. 

The indoor part of the club is really big and spacious. There are plenty of tables indoors and big walkways for people to go through. The dance floor was never too crowded or roped off, which was nice. There was an outdoor area too, which had heat lamps and was right next to the pool. The outdoor area was a little small, but that's fine since we spent most of our time on the dance floor anyways.

Drinks were really weak, even when I ordered an Adios, I could barely taste the alcohol, so -1 star for that. When we first walked up to the bartender, they also told us our comp drink tickets could only be used for well drinks and acted like we were idiots for not knowing that. Well, actually, we went to a different bartender after that and it turns out you can use it on anything ($20 max value).

They didn't seem too strict on dress code, like a lot of other clubs. I got in wearing flats (I hurt my ankle so no heels for me!) and one of my guy friends got in wearing nice sneakers, instead of dress shoes.

He took the picture when he was 15 and lost some weight and grew some facial hair. I went up to this so called ""lead"" of security Mateo and asked him what the procedures are on checking ID, and to my surprise he then started acting so rude and sarcastic. Why? Because he too doesn't know how to check for a fake ID or real one. I told him to look at his smile he has a missing tooth!!! Nope. Nope nope they wouldn't check that.

It's all the fun of day clubbing without the risk of skin cancer or the blazing heat from the sun! Plus, let's be real. Everyone looks better in the dark.

NightSwim is a huge pool party complete with DJs making their entrance by rolling into the pool inside of giant plastic bubbles, floaties and itsy bitsy bikinis all inside the huge outdoor patio of the gorgeous club XS. I love XS because the outdoor area makes up most of the club while there still is a dance floor inside next to the DJ and the beautiful dancers. Get your sexy on and gamble on tables surrounded by a pool and party people. When things get heated at the tables, you can jump in the pool to cool off.

Most girls wear their beach gear with the added sexiness of high heels but feel free to get down with your bad self in your normal clubbing attire as well. At least this is the only place you can get away with kicking your shoes off without the judgement of other girls who believe you should suffer in the shoes of your choosing throughout the night.

I also appreciate the honesty of the staff and the people who went to NightSwim the last night I attended. Someone returned my $800 Louis Vuitton wallet with the $250 cash and over $200 in gift cards untouched. You have all renewed my faith in humanity. Thank you to whoever turned in my wallet!

Once inside, coat check was $10 per item (I finally understood why girls weren't wearing any coats in the 40 degree weather). 

Some rando DJ was playing really crappy music and the dance floor was RIDICULOUSLY crowded. We had pregamed beforehand but weren't really buzzed by any means, and spent the next hour getting stepped on by awkward tall dudes who can't seem to stay on their feet and girls who clearly could not balance in their heels. One guy in front of me who's at least 6'4 was dancing with this chick who kept shoving him backwards and then pulling him back. Idk if they're a couple who's fighting or if they just met and this girl thinks it's a great way to flirt, but every time this happens (every 2 minutes) the dude CRASHES backwards into me. This continued for 90 minutes. Also, people were CONSTANTLY trying to get closer to the stage with full drinks and then getting pissed when their drinks get knocked out of their hands. It was also a complete sausage fest in there! The girls were decent looking, but there were SO MANY creepy looking guys! One old Asian perv kept groping girls and had to be escorted out by security. Seriously XS? You can't even keep a 1:1 sex ratio? I haven't even been to a frat party this bad.

I soon stopped enjoying the extremely mediocre music and had to focus all my energy on defending my territory with my elbows. By 1:30 AM Calvin Harris was still not here (he was advertised from 10 PM - 4 AM), and fiance and I were pissed off enough to just leave the club to take a break from all the madness. When we went back at 2:30 AM, Calvin Harris had arrived and the music had improved immensely. The crowd, on the other hand, and spilled out of the dance floor and into the aisles, forming a giant, solid, writhing mass of elbows and sweat. Fiance and I danced a bit at the edge as girl-lines tried to shove back into the crowd, but at this point people on the edge were linking arms to deny entry to the dance floor. After 20 minutes we decided even Calvin Harris was not worth this and left.

I'm not sure if I'm just used to clubs in Boston\/ NYC, but I've never been to a club this bad. The music was mediocre-below average most of the night, there were waaay too many creepers (ratio was at least 3:1 guys to girls), and there was barely room to breathe.

My visit was July 2009...So the place was ridiculously crowed, but that's to be expected.

That aside....It still took my breath away! It has more then a ""wow"" effect. I honestly couldn't believe how much they out did their sister club Tryst (my former favorite club in Vegas). This place blows Tao, Pure, and Rain out of the water!
The decor is FLAWLESS, the pool and private cabana's are a unique touch and the ambiance is UNFORGETTABLE.

Lastly.....Yes, there is an over abundance of old men and Asians, but face the facts people....this place is EXPENSIVE, (note the word overpriced was not used, since the ambiance is well WORTH the money) hence the demographic it attracts.....add in beautiful girls and hooker. Haha

Although I am over the whole Vegas club scene as there are  far too many roided up VIP hosts with far too much hair gel for my liking, my experience with XS has been above average in comparison to other clubs in its class (Tryst, Pure, etc.). 
The overall architecture of the club is amazing. I thought 14k gold was going out of style, but the architecture and integration of gold into the club takes the cake in comparison to the other Vegas club design. Granted the night is warm, you can find yourself stumbling from indoor to outdoor on the extravagant dance floor...just don't fall into the pool which is a the main centerpiece of the outside section of the club. For people who can become easily overwhelmed with the overall club vibe, there is a great outside bar that is surrounded by the pool. Here, guests can try their hand at the array table games or just regroup before re-entering the abyss in hopes of finding a girl to marry at the end of the night. The only words of caution that I would throw out there would be to those who are purchasing bottle service. There is a plethora of tables inside and out, and before pre-arranging bottle service, make sure you know exactly where you want to be. After talking to a number of groups who forked out the 5K for bottle service on the night of the grand opening, it seemed to be the general consensus that they had fallen victim to the bait and switch game that occurs far too often in the table service world. Make sure if you are requesting bottle service that you see a layout of all of the tables INSIDE and OUTSIDE of the club, as there are a number of tables that are outside and nowhere near the vibe of the club. 
I was disappointed with a couple aspects of the whole operation, but granted I was with a group of all males and we weren't forking out 5k for bottle service, I knew the Crystal and prominent tables were reserved for those who fork out the cash. Being that it was the grand opening of the club, the doors opened at 9pm and drinks were free until 10pm. Although this was a kind gesture, they club didn't actually start letting people in until around 9:30, so we had to kick up the burners and get some serious drinking done in the twenty minutes of open bar. Lil Wayne was celebrity guest which didn't do much for me. I would have preferred Denise Richards who was the guest at Prive at Planet Hollywood the same night.  Although I heard Lil Wayne's voice during the New Year's countdown, he was nowhere to be seen. I never get too excited about the whole guest appearance club thing, as it is merely a way to get star-struck club goers through the door of the club,but I really think Lil Wayne might have just pre-recorded the countdown and wasn't actually in attendance. At one point, I turned around and Jenna Jameson and Tito Ortiz were standing behind me, so I promptly proceeded to the men's restroom to sanitize in the event that any of her germs had become airborne and landed on me. A week later I read in Us Weekly that a number of other celebs w ere in attendance, but I didn't see any of them. My guess is that they were hiding out in the ultra-private VIP cabanas around the pool....which by the way seems foolish for the price being that they are completely separated from the club. Some of the bartenders seemed to not know what they were doing, but granted that this was the first night, such is somewhat expected. 
About 4 months ago, I returned to XS on a  Monday. Because there is so much space, it is a club that could really have the vibe killed if there weren't a lot of people in attendance. I was pleasantly surprised with the number of people that were present on a Monday....so clearly no one in Vegas cares that it was a weekday, or at least the people that go to XS. Check it out, it's no bang for your buck, but it's pretty damn cool. Just don't wake up with Mike Tyson's pet tiger and\/or a ring on your finger.",3,2,1

Got in around 9:30pm, got our drinks, sat on one of those chairs in the pool and we were good to go. The music was like top 40 \/ KIIS FM dj\/mash up style.

COVER:
$20 females\/$50 males
Like any other club in Vegas, female to male ratio must be at least 1:1 or a higher female ratio.  Make sure you stand in line early, the line gets pretty long.

CROWD:
Mixed

MUSIC:
Mostly house.  Some hip hop is played every once in a while but with house beats mixed in.

DRESS CODE:
Like every club in Vegas, people usually dress to impress - females in dresses and males in dress shirts and ties.  My past visit I noticed many people who were in t-shirts, flip flops, or Converse.  So who knows what the exact dress code is.

BARS:
Total of 4 - 2 inside, 1 outside on the right, and 1 at the gambling area (yes, it's Vegas, you can gamble and club).  Shots of Remy and Liquid Cocaines were $14 each, so expect to pay about that much.  

VENUE:
Beautiful!  The majority of inside is taken for booths for bottle service.  A decent sized, but yet small for the size of the venue, dance floor leads to the outside.  Outside are more tables and beds for bottle service, a pool with a few chairs, and even tables to gamble.  

The BEST part (and my reason for 5 stars) is the pool.  Part of the pool is ankle deep and you are allowed to stand there and dance (a great relief for all the ladies who love their stilettos), apparently guys are now allowed to do so too.  However, you are not allowed to go into the pool except on pool party nights which I believe is still on Sundays.  BUT, if you like to end your night in with a bang like I do, jump in the pool (I did!).  Just make sure that you and your friends are ready to leave because you will be escorted out by security (thanks to the security guy who escorted us, he had great humor in doing so).",2,1,2

A few men escorted us to our table and we began the evening. 
We had a certain amount of $$ to spend on booze and peripherals. Our waitress was very attentive. Each time we ordered a bottle of whatever, it was a spectacle.

The club is packed packed packed. Hardly any room on the dance floor, everyone is squished together. Even outside was packed.

I was surprised at how many older people were at the club. Most guys seemed like in their very late 20s or early 30's. Wasn't expecting that.

If you have been to this place before and was not able to get into the club bc boy:girl ratio etcetc READ ON! i am sure this review wil be helpful for you!

Location: The Club is located inside encore near the pool area. If you don't know where you are going just look for signs over your head inside the casino or follow another group of people who's dressed up and ready to party!

Service\/Line\/Guestlist: They don't have an organized GUESTLIST on weekend.  Most of the time people just wait in this super ridiculous line that wraps around the hotel!  If you have a large group of girls you can most likely get the promoter's attention and in additon, a simple conversation that involves ""my group has 10+ girls or some sort of firtation"" can probabaly easily get all the girls in for free.  Although the bouncer can be asses sometimes, just be patient with them if you want to save money!  It is easier if you can find a promoter near the main entrance of the club and work your magic from there!  Please don't have your whole group of girl standby and block the through traffic because the bouncer will be MAD at you! and just YELL at you until you move your whole party outa their freaking way!

For Large group with BOYS\/GIRLS: The bottom line is TIP! If you have more boys than girl you obviously need to tip more! If you have WAY more girl than boy you can probably sneak in the boy without costing the boys a penny (I am talking about a 10:2 ratio though).  Otherwise Tip is the way to go.  One way you can do this is to walk toward the inner ""speedy line"" (many people don't know this but they have a inner line that allows you to walk from the back all the way to the front).  There will be a bouncer\/promoter type of guy guarding this line and this will be the person that you tip! Tip can vary though i have tipped from 20 a person (one of my friend has tipped up to 150 a person).  If you don't want to wait in line or just won a money at the nearby black jack table, this is definitely worth trying.  
Just want to share my experience with you Folks bc i know we ALL hate waiting in that big fat line! 

The is definitely the place to be if you have never been to any nightclubs in vegas!  Felt like their music has gotten better since their opening and the people there are much cooler to hang out!

One thing that can be frustrating is their bar!  I am not sure why they only hire 3 bartender for each full bar! I am talking about a bar that have 10 milion customer screaming at you for drinks! REALLY ? 3 bartenders? They really need to improve on this to make the whole experience better!

So the line we got into turned out to be the wrong one. After waiting forever in that line and then picking another at random and waiting forever there I had to use the restroom. When I got out of line to leave I was rudely grabbed and shoved by a bouncer. 

When I came back and got back into line. After about five or ten minutes, three of these jerks come over, two grab me and without explanation shoved me out. When I asked why they said because I had left the line earlier.

I've never had as much satisfaction with a club as many times as I have with XS.  For the past year, I've been going to Vegas about once a month on average and I've been trying to venture out to see new clubs and compare and whatnot, but I always know that if I don't have one good night for the weekend, I can always rely on XS to give me that second good night.

It can get a little pricey, but you have to realize that it's Vegas.  Girls usually can get in free before midnight, and guys generally have to pay $30.  It really helps to get a promoter's number, especially for girls, but it's a little harder for guys unless you have an amazing girl to guy ratio.  Saturdays are also bad for promoters, but most other nights work pretty well.  There's a strict dress code for guys, especially for collared button up shirts and dress shoes.

When you walk in, the sight is pretty breath-taking.  You see lights streaming the entire ceiling and you see these luxurious booths with tables and seats all over the place.  You can look down to see the dance floor and just past it is an amazing clear and blue pool.  You can't go in the pool, but you can sit on some of their furniture that they have on the shallow end.  Girls really love this cause they take can off their shoes and dip their feet in the water.  They have lots of booths and tables surrounding the pool, some of which are free to all guests, not just by reservation.  There's even a bar and a mini casino out by the other side of the pool that makes it seem almost like island. 

The dancefloor is not bad.  It's not too small but it's not huge.  The best thing is that if you get too crowded or need a break, there's plenty of space outside for you to just chill or go grab a drink.  They have some pole dancers up top, which are OK.  They're not all amazing, but they're decent.  They play a lot of house music, which I love, so I never hav ea problem with it.  But they do mix in a couple top 40 and other popular songs into them so it's not just house.  

It's usually a good crowd.  Not too much, but not too little, except when it rains and everyone rushes inside...but the age range is generally mid 20's to mid 30's and everyone is just there to have fun, dance, drink, and get drunk.  It's  a lot more fun going with a group then trying to pick up girls though, cause most of the girls just wanna dance with their friends, like most other clubs haha.

Drinks run at about $14 for a cocktail, which is pretty average for Vegas, but 9\/10 times your drink will never come out wrong.  I don't know how they do it, but they hire some pretty badass bartenders, and most of them are pretty good looking girls.

But yeah, pretty much if you're looking for a good nightclub experience, XS is probably your best bet.",4,0,0

Diplo was playing for the night and the VIP list was not allowing for guys so my boyfriend paid about $80 for his ticket. No big deal. We go in it's still early and not very many people in yet probably close to 10:30. We head straight to the bar by the pool and poker table to get a drink. We each had a shot of tequila for $22 paid CASH each and leave a $20 CASH tip. Here is where it starts to get stupid the bartender obviously had a problem with my $20 tip as she rolls her eyes at me while counting her tip. But she doesn't know that I like to stick with one bartender the whole night for multiple rounds which means multiple tips your gonna get a minimum of $100 tip from me by the end of the night We go to the bag check to drop off some things and pay about $25 for a locker. We head back to the bar to order another round. This same bartender is avoiding me as she takes everyone else's order untill I'm the only left at the bar before she rudely comes to me and barks out ""Ugh like do you guys need anything else?"" I ignore the bitching and say yes please and order another round of tequila but this time I put it on my CARD $66 and give her a $30 CASH TIP. I think maybe she's having a bad day I'll up her tip so next time she's more polite. She counts her tip smiles shakes her head up and down like if she's pleased and continues with her work. Now on that receipt I make damn sure I always ZERO out the tip and leave a cash tip because I was once a waitress and know it's a lot nice to get cash tips. Jumping to today and checking the bank statement the bitch charged me a second charge for $25. Now I know I only used my card once because almost immediately after we were kicked out for NO REASON AT ALL. 
This is where the night turns ugly. We've only had 2 drinks each for the night and it's so early on that we haven't even had the chance to feel our drinks. We walk around the pool to take my sister inside because she has never been and I want her to see it before it gets packed. We stop right before the dance floor by the pool to take a picture and admire our surroundings. Im a few steps away from my sister, my back towards her and I'm looking at the pool. My boyfriend is a few steps in front of us closer to the club entrance. Then I here someone behind me talking to my sister demanding that she go with him. I turn around to see a short man in a black suit in my sister's face saying she had to leave. I walk up to them and ask what the problem is and why she was asked to leave. He said to me that it doesn't concern me. I say yes it does this is my sister why are you asking her to leave? Then he say ok you need to leave too. Then my boyfriend walks up and says what's going on. The short man then says to my boyfriend to step away and we were going to be escorted out. My boyfriend says why are they leaving I'm with them why are you asking them to leave? He then says oh your with them? Then you need to come with me too and I need all your IDs. He then calls for Back up. This tall white gentleman comes over and looks extremely confused because this guy has still not said what is going on. My boyfriend then talks to the taller man and says I'm sorry we're just really confused we were asked to leave and have no idea why. The short man then says because I cought you smoking and if you don't come with me right now then I'm going to have to call the cops. Now we're extremely confused we we're cought smoking? Smoking what? Where? HOW? We just had to walk through 4 lines get searched 3 times and allowed to come in the club but yet somehow we ""snuck"" something in? We finally walk away from the crowd to better hear each other and this man then proceeded to tell the other guy that he cought us smoking weed and had to take it away. We then ask him to please show it to us because just a few minutes ago he didn't even know we were all together. He then tries to pull out the I'll call the cops it you don't come with me. And my boyfriend asked him to please do so. We have nothing to hide we've done no wrong and even if we did do as he claims it's legal now in the state of Nevada so not even the cops can do anything. After that he then tries to tell us our ""miranda rights"" and says we will be charged with trespassing if we do not leave the casino and will be escorted off the primaces. The guy completely dropped the weed shit after finding out we Know our right then try this! After leaving and everyone escorting us out also being just as baffled as us my sister says is it because I'm wearing a head wrap? My sister and I are both Mexican my boyfriend is Mexican and white, but looks more white. My sister has extremely curly hair and wanted it up for the night.

They gave our perfectly legitimate IDs to the bouncer, who also looked them over, then glared at us and shoved our IDs to us, saying ""don't ever come back here using these again"".

However, XS by itself is a super awesome club on its own. Probably the only thing that sucks about XS is that there is always a really long line to get in....so make sure you know a promoter so you don't have to be in line forever. Their lines are kind of confusing so make certain that you're in the right line. 

What I like:
-In the summer, they open up the pools so girls with crappily painful but cute shoes can throw them to the side and dip their feet in and still look cute
-There's lots of space everywhere, unlike TAO. 
-It's a good mixed crowd
-There are actually places to sit if your feet get tired (trust me, this is really important to girls)
-House music. Enough said.
-They sometimes have famous DJs that play here, too.

What else is not so great:
-It's so hard to get in and out of the indoor part of the club. There's so much traffic and the doorways are so small!
-Drinks are so expensive... But that's the same for all Vegas clubs, right?
-The bartenders can be really rude...especially the girls. My friend got blamed AND CHARGED for a drink he never even ordered....I stand as the witness.
-If you don't have hook-ups, cover for guys is really expensive
-The indoor portion of XS looks exactly like Tryst in the Wynn...can we be any less original?

Tips:
-If you're looking for a cab afterwards, head over to the Wynn. Otherwise, expect to wait at least 30-45 minutes.
-Check out their Sunday night pool parties (in the summer)! It's actually pretty fun and they have really cool floaty toys (including a big swan!)

But after finally going, all I gotta say is meh.  I really don't think it lives up to the hype.  

1) This place is huuuugee, this place definitely is not as cramped like your typical Vegas club. Bonus points for having plenty of places of us non VIP folks to sit.  It's refreshing to actually have a club in Vegas that has seating without having to drop a grip load on bottles.   

2) Drinks are your average Vegas prices, so no real complaints or issues there.

3) Lines do move as fast as everyone says it does, so + points for them on that one too.

4) Everyone pays, even girls.  To me that's a big wow, that's surprising for a Vegas club.

So with all these pluses why 3 stars?  Plain and simple, the music.  I'm not really a big trance\/house\/techno guy, so I wasn't feelin' the music at all.  It felt like that's all they played all night, and that was enough to knock it down 2 stars.",2,0,0

It's nice. Actually, it's one of the nicest clubs I've seen and I've partied at many places in LA, SD, (parts of ) NY, and LV. Whoever came up with this idea is a genius. 

Bad thing is, it's a pretty happening club so the lines are long and you gotta get there early.

Good thing is the lines move pretty fast and the bouncers aren't as pretentious as other clubs (ahem*pure*ahem). 

Bad thing is if you get there early, you'll be wasted before 11pm and you might sober up by midnight. Then you just get bored.

Good thing is drinks are good and does it's job.

*Lots of Asians
*Lots of people
*Lots of space

Again, being from Miami, I know clubs, and honestly, Las Vegas has NOTHING on Miami nightclubs. Although I must say the venue itself is beautiful... Poolside cabanas, bars, and poker tables at night is lovely. But the over crowding and obvious tourists who don't know how to dress to a club is ridiculous. While in line, killing my feet in these pair of heels, I saw a guy in an AE polo and a girl in dirty sandals. I whispered to my boyfriend ""there's no way they're getting in like that"" and to my surprise... they were let right in. Really? That's what this upscale, popular club is letting in? You mean I didn't have to kill myself with 500 mini band-aids on my feet? I could have just came in CHANCLETAS? And they weren't the only under dressed people there. Try getting into Liv with sandals on, Unless you're Beyonce, you ain't getting in. The overcrowding was pathetic. By 12am no one can move more than a few inches. I was sitting next to a pole for hours unable to move fearing I would forever lose my good spot. I almost had my bladder burst until security decided they had enough of me sitting there and kicked me off. I would have RAN to the bathroom but it was so packed it took 20 minutes to move ten feet. While in the bathroom, security had to come to the stall next to me because two girls were doing god know's what in there. One of the girls kept reaching into my stall with her hand zombie style. I obviously switched stalls. This club is beautiful but sadly is poorly managed. I left by 1am and didn't even get to see the DJ I paid to see (Avicii). I guess you can call me a spoiled Miami girl.

I am sorry to say that but Last night, whoever the DJ that did the opening was didn't impress me at all. Was about to leave until I realized Ookay doing the change over. From there, my experience went from bad to awesome. I had the best time of my life until the end.

PRO
great space, great staff, I caught one of the bouncer jamming to the music,you don't see that often. We talk a little bit, you could see he was happy to be there unlike others

CON
Not sure if it is the open area in the back of the DJ, but the sound is not coming the way it should. So, it would be nice if they cover the back and make it more hermetic using that screen like curtain they have in the back of the DJ to provide an area for the sound to bounce back.

Highlight of the night 
At closing time, I went to that Cafe place to get something to eat, while I was eating, 3 guys came to eat and sat next to me asking  how the party was to my surprise,  one of them was Ookay, imagine how awesome that was. the other two were Marshmello. and Matt

We went to Vegas with a group of like 20, and we were told by our promoter to separate ourselves from the guys so that we could get in faster \/ for free \/ etc.  

So we did.

But at the end of the line, we bumped into this ONE guy that we knew, and a bunch of his friends whom we had never met before.  I don't even remember any of their names.

In short, basically the bouncers freaked the fuck OUT.  Since we were talking to guys in line, it meant that we came with them, which meant that we wouldn't be hanging out and mingling with other guys in the club.  If you talk to someone named Tila or some guy with a name along the lines of that, he is incredibly misogynistic and definitely called us cheap for trying to talk to guys -- is that not what you want?  We seriously did NOT get it.

Uhhh what the fuck??   One bouncer asked us to get out of line and go to a white podium, and then another bouncer got mad at us for getting out of line.  We tried to get back into line where we were, and we got yelled at.  Then we went to the back of the line where we got yelled at some more.  It was a mess.  The girls who had originally stayed in line ended up having to pay, which sucks because none of us were supposed to.

Anyway, after almost an hour with speaking slash arguing to several incredibly rude bouncers, my friend finally played dumb and convinced one of the bouncers to let us in for free anyway.  The time spent in line was incredibly sobering.

XS is overrated.  Yes, it is pretty, but it's no different from Marquee or Tryst or whatever.  There are a shit ton of tables, a tiny dance floor, a pool... blah blah blah.  It was fun inside, but only because I made it fun.  I could have had just as much fun at another club.",9,5,2

My friends and I were initially going to go clubbing at Marquee the first night we got to Vegas, but when my friends and I arrived to join the rest of our group who got to Vegas earlier (and were supposedly in line for Marquee), we found out that our entire group got banned from clubbing in Marquee that night because one of our tipsy friends had been drinking in line (kind of funny when I think about it), even though we were staying at The Cosmopolitan for the duration of our trip. But no matter, we were determined to find ourselves some fun that night..and that we did at XS!

THE WAITING LINE: When we were waiting in line for the club, the bouncer was very nice and patient, unlike the stereotypical mean and cocky bouncers I always hear about. He was even willing to hold up a conversation with us even though I'm pretty sure we were just talking nonsense at that point.

MUSIC & PEOPLE: I loved the music selection from XS because they combined both top 40 stuff that EVERYONE knows how to sing along to and electronic music, which I enjoy very much! The dance floor was not super packed so we were able to dance and move freely. The people in XS were all super chill as well, which added to the experience.

THE BAR: When my friends and I decided to get more drinks at the bar, the bartender was quick to take our orders and give me my yummy Midori Sour. And after our short bar break, we jumped back into the crowd to have more fun. We had so much fun dancing the night away that we didn't even realize when the dance floor started to clear. While the rest of my group sat down at the vacated tables to rest, two friends and I just continued dancing like we didn't have a care in the world.

SERVICE: After we left the club, one of our friends realized that he had left his credit card at the bar. We ran back to the club and the employees were very understanding and let us back in. One of the bartenders asked our friend for his name to make sure he was the owner of the card before returning it to him, which was pretty considerate.

I genuinely do not understand how the bouncers think it's okay to treat people the way they treated me. Is it that hard to have a little respect for a customer? Without a doubt, this club does not care about their customer service. And granted, I'm not an ugly duckling. My girlfriends and I always get invited to the most expensive tables, backstage at events, box seating at sports events, and get treated very well at ANY nightclub here in LA, where we live. This past Saturday night I wasn't drunk, I was in no way being sassy or rude, but even the simplest of questions I asked the bouncers were all responded with a huge attitude. I asked one of the bouncers what the stamp on my wrist was for, and he told me ""if you're going to question it, you don't deserve it."" And licked his thumb, and wiped the stamp off me. I have never been treated in such a disrespectful manner in my life. Next, a different bouncer ended up making me cry, on my 22nd birthday. He kicked me out of a table when the man who purchased table specifically invited me there, but the bouncer didn't see me walk in with the man. So I was sitting down, not drunk\/obnoxious, and he told me to get out and leave. Simply because I didn't know what the man who purchased the tables name was. It wasn't until the man came back and told the bouncer he invited me that I was allowed back in the table. But the rudeness didn't begin there. Upon arrival, I texted my promoter (CARLOS REYES) that I was arriving, which he had asked me to do so. He had promised me that his host would sit my friends and I at a promo table, which my friends and I were looking forward to. I asked a bouncer where I could find Carlos' host, and we were told there aren't any hosts. The man checking ID's laughed at me when I told him that Carlos promised me to be seated at an indoor promo table. Carlos finally texted me back, saying that he was ""working on getting his bosses attention to help me out,"" but at that point, I knew that it was all a scam. I asked him once more if he would try to keep his promises since I was there to celebrate my and my friends birthday, but he ended up never texting me back. So needless to say, my friends and I had the worst experience, and THE PROMOTERS ARE FILLED WITH EMPTY PROMISES!!!!

I've never been so mesmerized after I walked through the front entrance, up the stairs, around the curve to see the dancefloor, the pool, and the bar in the back. It was beautiful and it still is. The club is lined with gold figures posed in their dance moves and they stick out along the walls of the club. Every single time I come to Vegas, it's usually a given that I'm coming here. 

There was a point in time where I didn't like XS as much, basically back in the time before Cosmo and all the Asians flocked and hung out here. Now they're all at Marquee and XS is more diversified. Thank goodness! It's still crowded like crazy though and I can't stand it. Even the outdoor pool area is packed like sardines. To get through this crowd you need to take charge, and you probably need to push some drunk beezies out of your way.

I like how they moved their DJ booth to the middle where people can see them especially since Vegas clubs are featuring the world's top DJ's. This past week I saw Dada Life and they were amazing! People were going nuts when they came on. I'm just so glad I had a table to sit at or else I would've gotten lost in the crowd. 

Like always, the drinks are expensive, most of the guys are creepers, the bouncers are d-bags, and the cute girls don't have any problems getting in. That's Vegas, baby!",3,1,2

Obvious:
1. beautiful decor... hello! it's Encore... 
2. crowded as heck... it's at its peak of popularity...
3. crowd varies, from great looking to not so great looking... but yah like i said peak of popularity, everyone is trying to check it out.

Pros:
1. HUGE! our group got split up and lost in the first few seconds of walking in
2. available seats to rest at
3. wading pool for tired feet
4. good ventilation

Cons:
1. HUGE line... but organized. Get there early! we got there a min or two before 10 and while the line was intimidating we didn't have to wait as long as I expected. 
2. no guestlist... sorta... they do bc we were on one... but don't and can close at random times blah... i guess i'm just not in the-know enough hehe
3. music was only so-so to a large portion of my group... i was cool with it though

Over all... get there early, be patient, be nice... check it out at least once if not more. Drinks strong, bartenders friendly, bouncers nice (to me at least :) XS and Tryst are my fav at this time :)",1,0,0

It was a week day when I went, so it wasn't too crowded. Lil Jon was playing and he's a decent DJ. 

Since I'm a local and I usually avoid the strip, I was (as usual) SHOCKED when I was told it was $52 for a beer, wine, and a shot for the the birthday boy. This is why I stay away from the strip. Not that it is their fault - that's how they pay their rent. I wish clubs like this would offer local prices even when it comes to drinks. Because seriously we could just stash alcohol in our car and run in and out of the club. It's not like we're staying in a hotel and have no way to get more booze. Just a thought!

One of the things that makes my time here is how well-designed it is. In the summer, they have it connected to the massive pool complex to the side. You can dip your toes int eh water, visit what my friends call ""poker island"" (has gambling tables and a bar in the middle of the pool area), and generally just get a few gulps of fresh air and mingle. One of the few clubs where outside tables are just as fun as inside; while they are more chill, you can still hear the headlining DJ spin very well.

Now, let's discuss THE INSIDE. The dance floor is large, and for whatever reason (better crowd control? less overfilled by the club"" more room outside to spread out in and still hear the DJ?) it doesn't seem to get as sardine-packed as other clubs on the strip. I personally like to be able to dance and move around, and XS always seems to be a good place to that. The tables surrounding the dance floor are arranged in a couple of tiers as well, and access to the tiers isn't restricted to only tables. My friends and I like to stand behind tables sometimes for a great view an fun dancing; there are platforms and poles as well, for those really feeling the Vegas spirit. I've seen big names like Zedd, RL Grime, and Skrillex play here, as well as smaller DJs, and I always have a fantastic time no matter what. The crowd in general also seems a little older and a little nicer than other places - I realize that this is totally a perception and not necessarily the truth, but just something I've noticed and adds to how much I like this place.

Beware: guestlist in the summer will only allow you ""patio access"" aka pool area; not inside the actual club part. In the winter months you are able to get full access on the guestlist. I think it's worth the cover price (usually 20-50 bucks depending on the DJ and your gender) for full access in the summer; that said, I've been able to cajole bouncers to let me and a girlfriend into the inside space before.

Drinks are expensive - typical Vegas club prices. My bar tab for a round of 3 vodka cranberries and 3 shot of fireball was over 100 bucks. Being a girl, I knew that my friends and I could find a table to post up at for more drinks and I wasn't worried, but for the guys, may want to pregame a little if you're not trying to drop a few hundred dollars on drinks.

One small gripe: the line to be ""searched"" for Guestlist was a shitshow this past Friday night. DJ Snake was supposed to be playing (never showed, which I wasn't happy about, but I didn't pay to see him and the replacement was fantastic, so I didn't mind too much), and I know he's big, but COME ON. It was a huge clusterf*ck of people all shoving and cutting each other off; people coming around the outside and cutting in at the front. PLEASE have a line so things move faster, and maybe have a couple other people wanding people down. Never seen this kind of bottleneck before, but I'm usually here earlier because I hate waiting in line.

Even considering the above, I still give it 5 stars because of my repeatedly great experiences here. Thank you, XS, for being so good to me.",3,0,0

just posting this review to reflect the bartender lady iv had, some are the biggest bitches you will unfortunately ever have to meet. worst experience with a bartender lady i have ever had. seriously she was the worst.
i tipped a couple bucks for my hugesly overpriced drink and she said "" THATS IT? JUST THAT? YOUR NOT GOING TIP ME MORE?"" i cant believe they would say something like that. tips are an option for SERVICE, not for some dirty bimbo working at XS to try to steal money from drunk people. never will go here again after that

anyways if you like paying absurd fees to get in then go ahead, iv gotten in for free before and thats the only way id go here. 

they make you wait ridiculously long lines if you dont have tickets, 
even with tickets still had to wait a bit. i just hate having to pay an absurd cover then pay 20 bucks a drink
thats so dumb to me. 20 bucks?!? how can people afford that...for ONE drink. thats crazy. 

again i did have fun here before but i do remember one time the main dj was playing at 12:30 so we went to the main dancefloor at like 11:50 and the good for nothing ""bouncer"" wouldnt let anyone in, everyone outside was so angry when that guy with no career stopped everyone and only let people in who payd him cash...so we greased him and he let us in...its just a joke to me.",1,0,0

Our table was at the perfect location, right outside before the pool in the corner -- just enough people traffic, not stuffed inside with the crazy crowd or far off in the distance at the other end of the property.
Plus, they totally took care of us -- kept our ice buckets full, kept our mixers stocked, and the bottles coming!  They even came and replaced our table twice because they were unhappy with the wobbliness of the table that was there to begin with.

This place filled up fast!  We got there around 10:15PM and by 11PM it was packed!

My face is the exact same as my driver license but only my hair changed in terms of color and texture.

Came here last night to see Avicci, but I have been here a couple times before. I've always really recommended this club. 

It was so busy last night and even being on a guest list the girls had to wait I would say about 30-45 minutes to get in.

Like most people say, this place is visually the BEST to experience in Las Vegas. It is indoor\/outdoor, by pools, with palm trees and cute outdoor lights everywhere. This is a place I think you can enjoy a conversation unless you are on the main dance floor. Sometimes you just want to look around and say, WOW!

XS has set the bar high for all nightclubs.

Plenty of bars with fast bartenders everywhere so waiting for a drink is not that bad. They also have girls going around selling shots.

Guide to having a good time at XS:

1. Go on a night with topnotch DJ's whose music you can groove to for many hours.

2. Get a VIP table + bottle service if you can fork up the money. IT'S WORTH IT.

3. Look around. Lots of interesting\/strange characters!

4. Dance. Laugh. Have a good time.

The layout at XS is great because you get a great view of the DJ from almost every angle. The outdoor area features a pool where crazy antics take place. There is minimal seating for the general public -- gotta stand if you don't pay up. If you're okay on your feet for hours you'll be fine, but ladies know it is SO worth it to have a table. Not to mention service from the hostesses is excellent and they're also pretty cute.

My favorite part of the night was dancing up on the cushions of our booth seats (happy feet!). It was comfy as well as an awesome vantage point. We could see: 1) all the oddly dressed and\/or super drunk people around us and 2) AFROJACK+GUETTA as they dropped those beats!

DATE TIP (Gentlemen): Make a note of the paragraph above regarding seating. The ladies will love you if you have a table. Or at least visit you to rest their feet. ;)

DATE TIP (Ladies): Cushion dancing is awesome, but at an elevated height one is much more prone to creative pickup lines. A small price to pay for the view you get!",47,42,47

When we got to the club (myself +3 girls) the line was FREAKIN Insane on a Friday around 12am. We made our way to the front to see if there was anyway to bypass the line! The door guys at XS are tough cookies! After talking to 3 of the door guys we finally found one who agreed that we shouldn't wait in the long line:) Unfortunately, we didn't get away with free cover:( But jumping the line definitely saved us at least an hour! 

This club is HUGE and gorgeous! Everyone was dressed to impress and looked amazing! The club also has a cool pool where you can sit and waddle your feet in...not sure how safe it is dealing with drunk chicks, but it's a cool feature. 

On the downside, the DJ was kind of wack. The entire night consisted of mash-ups. From what I heard, Saturday nights have better music. We ended up staying till about 3:30ish. XS is one of the better clubs in Vegas and by far the most unique!",0,0,1

Your mileage may vary as in any club but it definitely was one of the better clubs in Vegas that I really enjoyed.  

In terms of costs, guys (unless you're getting a table) should expect to have to get tickets online or brave the lines - expect paying around $30 or more (we paid $50).  Girls should expect to get in either for free or much cheaper depending on your promoter\/method of entry.  The line was a breeze though as long as you get there around 9:30-10:00 PM.  

The venue is pretty awesome.  The main dance floor has a cool spinning chandelier on top along with two go-go dancers on the sides and a not-too small main dance floor.  There are a few bars on the side as well along with an entire outdoor section to explore right behind the dance floor (to get to these sections though requires traversing the edges).  The outside is also gorgeous with several pool areas, bars and a gambling section at the very back that doesn't interfere with the main club section along with it's own go-go dancer.  Drinks were pretty normal fare for a club, nothing special about the taste\/price.  

The DJ set was kind of strange before the main act, Avicii and a lot of my party did not enjoy it.  Avicii himself was awesome and put on a great show (and even from the outside, it was pretty sweet).  However, be warned, again like in most packed clubs, getting on\/off the dance floor is a pain and felt at times worse than Marquee in which traffic control was chaos.  Stick to a location and bring lots of drinks or have a table if you have the money.  

Again, XS was a great-looking club that unfortunately on our night had a ho-hum DJ before Avicii and some crowd control issues within the dance floor itself.  Definitely do want to come back and see more including the night swim!",3,0,2

I love the decorations and vibe of the club, it is however too pact. I went in line and it took like 10 minutes to get in which is great but once inside, hardly any room to dance. I love it better when dancing outside in the pool area where for us ladies can take off your shoes and dance on the edge of the pool and so much better cuz its stuffy inside the dancefloor. Other than that if you don't have money to spend on tables you can at least sit on the day beds that is in the pools so there is some seating room at least. 


Oh FYI do not get the security and bouncers mad, they are really strict when waiting in line as well, My friends tried saving a spot for me in line and they were not having it even though the club wasn't opened yet. So I went to the back in the line but no big cuz it took only 10 minutes to get inside. they do not like it when you are saving spots for your late friends so be careful, other then that, love the club.",0,0,0

The plus about this club is the pool area and being able to relax my feet and still dance the night away. This is always a staple in my trip when visiting sin city. Drinks are pricey and the music differentiates depending on the dj but it eventually changes to hip hop and edm.

But i went here with 2 of my girlfriends and we all got in free, the boys were quite expensive at $50 per person, and I Know that a couple of my other friends that didn't get in free and came separate from us had to pay $30 (they  were girls). 

We went on a Saturday night and it wasn't as packed as most clubs i've been too. There was actually room to dance and walk around in a comfortable setting. (i read some reviews below that said they were packed and no space, but i must have went on a good night) Because it is the #1 nightclub in Vegas right now. Or so I've heard.

I had the best experience here though. We got there early and were one of the first ones in, i know were usually supposed to be fashionably late, but we wanted to actually get in and have fun. The weekend we went it was the same weekend all our friends went, so it was packed with only people we knew, which made it 100 times more fun. 

Anyways... we walked around the whole place and got a good look before everyone came in. They had dance poles on top of the booths for drunk girls to dance on, there was really no places to sit because all the booths and tables were reserved for bottle service. They had canopies that looked high class, and giant sofas all around the outside. They had about 3-4 bars, but the one outside in the middle was always super busy. They also had their own girls dancing everywhere. Their staff was only good looking, or at least a lot of them were, both girls and guys. 

I thought the DJ was good, but i like all types of music and am never too picky, I didn't dance the whole time anyways, just mingled with my friends all over the club. 

DRINKS: so freakin expensive, but people are willing to pay. All mixed drinks were $15. I know that Blush next door has open bar from 10-11pm I think and you can go into XS early, get a re-entry stamp and then go get free drinks at Blush, since it's right next door and come back into XS with no line because you are re-entering. So i recommend doing that or drinking before. Unless you are a girl, you really don't have to pay for drinks cuz guys their are on vacation and don't care how much they spend really. Well that's what i've noticed. 

DRESS CODE: there is a dress code for guys, i KNOW only dress shoes are allowed, but they can wear jeans and maybe a collard shirt. Girls can wear anything. 

Overall, this club is really really nice and i LOVED it, but i agree with whoever said it below that I would ONLY go here for vacation because it's an elaborate club and not one a normal person can afford everyday. Unless your a girl, you really do get most things free. 

GO HAVE FUN!",2,1,2

However I would have giving it a 1 based on service. The people who work here are the RUDEST people on the planet. Our waitress, Noi...yes Noi is her name was a B. First our table reservation was lost (not actually lost they were just being rude because we were on guest list and they had set it up so we would have a 2 bottle min for our table instead of 4 so apparently that couldn't possibly be right but there was no way 8 girls could drink 4 bottles of alcohol.) anyway after we got in and were lead to our table by the pool we see that there are only 4 chairs, we asked for more and snotty little Noi says ""this is what you get for 2 bottles, if you want to buy more then you can find someone and we might be able to move you to a better table."" I swear Noi was almost using her fake boobs as floatation devices in the pool. When she brought the bottles we paid and even gave her a VERY generous tip, hoping she would be nicer, did she? yeah for the other 2 seconds we saw her she was a peach. I had to drink a couple of cocktails quickly to calm down. But once I did we had a great time dancing. 
If you don't mind being treated like crap by a stupid waitress go here you can drink until she looks like a normal person and not the devil and then have a great time.
IF however you would like great service, a great view and fantastic dancing I sugguest Pure. We were there with table service the night before and it far surpassed all the hype and attitude of XS",0,1,0

The outside of the club has an elegant pool, and gazebo covering a bar and mini casino.  There are also tables surrounding the perimeter of the outside for bottle service.  The inside has a fairly small dance floor in front of the DJ booth and bottle service tables taking up probably 60-70 percent of the indoor area space.  The night I went, Avicii was the performer and he brought quite a crowd.  The place was so packed, it was pretty difficult to find a place for our group of 6 to settle, and that's just about the only bad thing I can say about this place.  Overall, the club was extremely nice and very classy.  The amount of work it took to make this club is amazing and I can't imagine how much it cost to build this place.  If you are a girl I would advise you to just get your name on a guestlist via calling or by one of the dozens of promoters walking around the Vegas Strip.  If you are a guy, you can try your luck by putting your name on the guestlist if you have a lopsided amount of women in your group, but if not, you should just purchase tickets online, which on average is $50.   I would say this and Hakkasan are my favorites.",0,0,0

I would recommend going through a promoter if you can to avoid paying full price for tickets to enter. I was in contact with a couple since one who will not be named completely changed her tune on pricing at the last minute. I won't be going through her again.

I then worked with another promoter who said they can get guys in for $25. We show up and the guys had to choose between $25 for OUTSIDE of $75 for INSIDE! That's too much. This club also splits up guys and girls as they enter forcing the guys to choose between the price of inside or outside without time to consult their group.  

It was a little easier on the girls though I had my ID checked by 3 different people and had to have someone write me a pass to be given to another bouncer. I was given a lot of attitude and sent blame for the fault of a bouncer girl. It was honestly way too many hoops to jump through for a half decent time outside of the club.   

Next time, I'll be looking elsewhere where I'm not being toss around just to enter the outside of a club.",7,2,0

Went here on Saturday night to blow it up one final time in Vegas. Since we stayed at the Encore, you can pay for line passes and side-step the chaos. As mentioned by another Yelper, it did feel so damn good to cut in front of the mile long line and go straight in. 

Dance floor is a nice size but like any club in Vegas eventually it gets packed. Plenty of stripper poles for the girls to do their thing. Two Vietnamese girls got on the pole and ask my girl to join in, she was too sheepish but it would have been great if she did. 

I also liked the fact, if you need a break from the action inside the club, you could go outside. It's still crowded outside but more space for you to breathe. But also there's chairs and ledges you can sit on. Plus, the girls can dip their feet in the pool. 

The one thing that stops it from being perfect...the music. For me, a tad too much techno\/electronica\/dance etc. If the DJ mixed in some more hip-hop beats, it would have been sublime. 

What makes this place memorable for me is that I saw the greatest thing ever. As the GF and I was weaving through the dance floor. A little, cute old Vietnamese lady ,that resembled my mom, was being escorted hand-in-hand by a pack of hot ass blondes and dark-hair brunettes through the dance floor. I yelled out at her upon this sight of incrediblness and she even heard me. Bless her small, club going heart... 

So...Decor, sexy & gorgeous. Scenery, sexy & gorgeous. Bartenders, sexy & gorgeous. Service was sexy and attentive.

Let me preface this with saying I have been to some of the best clubs around the world for EDM and my husband and I love a great dance night out. We were celebrating our 10-year wedding anniversary (married in Vegas) over Labor Day weekend. We paid for GA tickets for all of our guests and chose this club based on generally positive reviews and because Kaskade was playing that evening. That said, here is the down-low (take it or leave it).

As not to be a complete nay-sayer, the club is indeed beautiful and I would choose an indoor\/outdoor flow over a ""sardine box"" club any day. We went to get in line as recommended by 10.30pm to avoid a long wait and as such, we can't complain about the line to get in, although oddly only guys were in line with us (guess they got the memo that they get charged heaps at the door by bouncers if arrive too late because the club wants primarily girls  ). As for bouncers being rude based on other comments, I would say they meet the standard of all Vegas clubs - very stoic and do not give two shits about making your night better - you are just another one of the many party goers they have to put up with over the course of the evening.

On to the show . . . sadly we did did not get the memo that in order to enter the main dance floor you have to stand in another line, not to mention there is no place to sit unless you have a reserved table or cabana. I realize at a club, there is not usually much sitting, but just because we opted out on a cabana for $2K or table for 5K (thank the lord), we are cattle class. All good, but when I pay for a $25 drink, at least have a couple of stools at the main bar to rest the high heels for 5 minutes!

TIP: Once on the main dance floor after waiting in another line, choose wisely on going back out to the poolside as you might not get back in. Had I known in advance about the second line, I may have chose another club. Because we were earlier than most, we did get the chance to dance right in front of the DJ booth until later packed in like sardines. As an EDM music fan, all I can say is that the pre-game show of DJs was sad. I realize they are meant to sound worse than the main act, but I would any EDM playlist blasting outside at the pool at our hotel would have been better. That about sums it up. Kaskade took way too long to come on and could not bear to stay and experience further disappointment - peace out at 2am. 

I am sure on a less busy Vegas weekend of the year, XS has greater potential, but take my word for it that you are probably better off going to one of the smaller clubs with a good house DJ unless hell bent on seeing a big act who typically only plays for one hour near closing time. Go to Ibiza if you want the big-named DJ experience done right.",6,2,0

I remember it like it was yesterday, the first time I went to XS.  I remember because it was probably the greatest day of my life, and I would never be the same again.

XS is like Chicken Soup for the Soul.  If it's been more than a few days since you were last there, you are inevitably going through some rough times in your life.  You're probably freaking out on people, ultra stressed and you just don't know why you look like hell all the time...  

But the moment you walk in, you're literally bathed in a holy light that cures you of all ailments and forgives you for your sins.  

If you are not already extremely hammered, that was probably a bad decision on your part for not pre-gaming, but there are plenty of $14-17 drinks available.

Granted, some nights there are literally a sea of asian people there, but it's all fine by me.  If you look at the reviews on here you'll see that it's about 94% asian reviewers, but that's not necessarily representative of the club, it's more like 82% asian.  Nah just kidding, it used to be worse but these days it's a pretty well-rounded crowd.

Bottom line, what other club have you been to that cost $100 million to make?  Definitely not the lame ass club in your hometown. Go to XS.",5,9,2

There were hot guys everywhere!!!  *drooool*  And all the girls were dancing on stripper poles.  The guys were pretty aggressive.

But hey if you also wanna be suckered by the bouncers or still wanna be baller you can pay off the bouncer to get into the ""express line"". That could cost you anywhere from $20-100 though. But hey this is Vegas money can buy anything right? 

The venue itself is pretty spectacular once you get in! It features a huge pool which yes people do jump into fully dressed or in there undies. Although be prepared to get kicked out if you get out of the pool soaking wet. Also be aware of them douches splashing everyone on the sides. Yes there are fights that break out randomly as we witnessed. 

The drinks are pretty standard and definitely pricey. But again this is Vegas so you gotta pay to play right! Cmon $5 for regular coke and $10 for a bottle of water too for those DD's! Cocktails and beers range from $10-20 as well. But hey if you got girls in your group and its ladies night don't forget to get them free drink vouchers! 

The music is a pretty much a mix of EDM but depends on the DJ spinning that night. Sadly we didn't get to see Zedd so we had some no name guy playing all night. The dance floor does get packed and watchout for them bouncers that will literally football style push everyone out of the way to make room for staff or the baller VIP table guests to get through. Yeah people be getting squished in the middle but oh wells its  Vegas right! 

If you're coming to see a specific artist play for the night definitely check XS's twitter or Facebook before coming! Otherwise go hit up Marquee or somewhere else!",15,8,8

For the Vegas glitz and glam, I think this is one of the best  and largest clubs because of the open layout, gorgeous decor, good vibes and decent music.  

COVER:
Friend's promotor got our bachelorette party in for no cover and a quick 10 minute wait.  Otherwise, not sure how much cover is for the fellas, I'm assuming it's the usual $30+.  The only suck part was they wouldn't let us wear our bachelorette gear of beaded necklaces and the bride wasn't allowed to wear her crown. Weird.   If you're staying at Encore, ask concierge if they give passes for guests to bypass the wait.  I saw a separate line of people walking past us to the door, asked one of the guys and he said they're guests of the hotel.   

VENUE:
It's like a grand entrance walking into this spacious layout with the bars, booths, and stripper poles surrounding the dance floor in front.  WIth the open air, pool, and another bar just beyond the dance floor.  The dance floor isn't the biggest but it does the job and I like how you can venture easily outside to dance around the pool or kick off your shoes and frolic in the water.  There are a bunch of cabanas on the first and second level overlooking the pool area.  I think I even saw a casino area?!   I liked how there were ""free"" seats around, not just VIP seating.  I saw some lounge beds in the pool, which looked really cool.  Drinks are the usual 15+ bucks. Pre drink for sure. 

BEATS:  
While they were pumping some house when we got there, I was relieved when they started mixing in some hip hop throughout the night.  Ok mix in general,  towards the end of the night you couldn't even tell the difference anyways.

ATTIRE:
Vegas hootchie mama gear for the guys and gals of course....but I like to keep it classy hootchie ;-)  One thing I noticed that was interesting was the outfits of the two go-go dancers here.  While most of the dancers in the other clubs are shakin it in their bra and panties.  These dancers were wearing cute dresses that covered all their goods, leaving a only a bit of cleavage.  Classy!

So much fun we didn't even realize we stayed till the closing.  Yay Vegas  sunrise walk of shame!  Def. spend your money here if you are looking for a club to doll up and get your drinkies\/dance on.",3,2,3

We picked up our tickets earlier that day which by the way the only bad experience I had was from the guy handing out the tickets. Seemed like he had a stick up his butt! But other than that we got our tickets just fine. He told us to be there at 9:30 ppsshh!
We arrived at 10:30 and walked right in.

If you do not have presale tickets though I did notice around the corner the normal line was long.

Once inside the lights and decor grabbed our attention. it set the mood perfectly. We went straight to the bar for some drinks. average prices; I was expecting more because it was Encore but it wasn't bad.

The music was awesome! If you Like EDM they were rocking it starting at the beginning of the night. We were lucky to have one of our friends buy a table so we had our own space. 

Later on in the night Calvin Harris came on and we tried to get on the main dance floor. It was packed, they weren't allowing anyone in on the floor. If you want to dance when the main act comes on try to be on the floor prior.

As soon as you're in, everyone treats you like a rock star.  For example, I walked into the restroom and I had 2 or 3 ushers saying, ""Welcome to the restroom."" I thought to myself, Are you f'ing serious?  Then they proceeded to brush the lent off my back as I washed my hands.  This shit was so funny because I saw some guys sneaking out without washing their hands to avoid leaving a tip or to save themselves the embarrassment.

We'll start off with the 'VIP' line.  There's 16 of us, 2 of which went to the front to make sure we were in the right area for bottle service.  When they got back, we open up the rope to let them in where we were (in line), and some power-trip hungry bouncer comes up and ROARs at them to go to the end - HELLO, we are the last group\/ppl in line -- ""Doesn't matter"", he orders them to get out and go to the back of line.  Meanwhile, the same bouncer is allowing other people to cut in and join the group that is in front of us.  Does that make sense?!  I was livid.

So we get in, and we're expecting a nice table to accomodate all of us, since we're putting down **a MINIMUM of $3000**.  Do you know that these people tried to put us in 2 SEPARATE tables, OUTSIDE?!  There were several tables inside that were empty, with the infamous 'reserved' sign on them.  We reserved our table atleast 2 weeks prior, so there was no way we were sitting outside.

We were right about to bail when they backtracked and told us a table had just become available inside (I'm still seeing empty reserved tables everywhere, btw).  AGAIN, 16 of us, and they are going to sit us in a booth that MAYBE sits 6 -- we cut out at that point, as our patience had run out.

I went here last Sunday night with a girlfriend who had never been to Vegas before. We got in pretty quickly via the guest list (no cover,) ran through the indoor area and made a round or two around the pool area. Considering that most clubs I've been to are stuffy and crowded, having a giant outdoor area is a godsend. 

We didn't try the drinks or stay long enough to see how crowded it gets after midnight, but it seems like the ideal place to bring a group and buy a bottle or attempt to get a comp. It's also a good place to mingle, because there were quite a few attractive people mixed in with the odd middle-aged women going out of their minds ""dancing"" between booths. 

The pool area is a bit of a hazard. One girl, unfortunately, stepped into the pool on accident in the area that isn't lit, but partially hidden by seat cushions. It's a really cool idea, just not very well executed.

XS opens at 10pm, so I recommend everyone to line up starting at 930-945pm. A large improvement that they have made is that they made little rooms so that the club line does not overflow into the main pathway. This is a smart idea. However, when we were in line, it took so long to get into the club. Not only that, we were on the guest list. It means that the women with me were supposed to get into the club for free. However, you have to get a piece of paper from one of the promoters verifying that you are indeed on the guest list to hand to one of the security guys at the front to let you in. I still had to pay $30 entrance because I am a guy. How sexist huh? We even asked the line staff as we were in line about the guest list process but they don't care. We are paying good money to come here and we don't deserve to be treated like crap.

Once we actually get into the club, it was pretty empty because those pretentious party promoters\/line staff want to make the appearance that the club is really busy. This is honestly not necessary considering that it gets really packed later on as the night progresses. Of course, the way to start the night is by drinking a shot. So we see Jessie and I make first contact. Jessie is very recognizable by her enormous boobs. She was very nice and recommended shots for us. She made us 4 wet p**sys. However, to fit our group of girls, she creatively changed the name to 4 wet p*nises. So, we went to Jessie for drinks the remainder of the night because she was just that awesome. 

Also, the caliber of people coming here are just not what it used to be. In particular there was this woman affectionally labeled by Jessie as ""barrel roll."" She was a hot mess and really surprised that security didn't escort her out. She kept dancing erratically like she was on a barrel like Wild E. Coyote and falling numerous times.

On another note, instead of escorting ""barrel roll"" out, security was more attentive to harassing the customers at the club. I was standing waiting for my friends to come out of the bathroom and the security guard rudely told me I couldn't stand there. So where am I supposed to stand to wait for my girlfriends? This happened to me on numerous occasions. Whatever happened to great hospitality? It is not here. I recommend going somewhere else. Venues in Vegas get old. XS is starting to become that.

 They would not allow the misters to be turned on outside our cabana and within it there was NO air circulation.  No member of our party could sit inside of the cabana for more than 1 minute and that was only to pour their drink. Drinks were incredibly overpriced, once glass of champagne cost $25. From our location you could not hear the music well, the sound system was terrible. They had a bad DJ that only played top 40 music.  

While standing near our cabana, we heard many people with the same complaints. The club itself however is designed beautifully and worth only a 1 time visit. It is very large but even with its size was very overcrowded. Not a good experience and definitely not recommended.",1,0,0

Came Sunday on St. Patrick's day and got to see Red Foo of LMFAO. Music was on point and I'm a hip hop girl yet I was still having an amazing time. 

Ladies dress up! I was underdressed. I think I was the only one in shorts, a slutty top, and heels. Everyone looked like 10's in their million dollar hoochie dresses. 

We made friends with another birthday party and they were on the guestlist and asked the bouncer if we could join. XS didn't have a problem with more ladies at all and gave us all free drink vouchers! Now that's what I'm talking about. No cover either except for the one gentleman in our group. Also got to skip that long ass line. And the bouncers were super nice and even took photos for us.

TIP TO LADIES WHO WEAR LOTS OF MAKEUP TO LOOK HAWT AND MISLEAD MEN

I got a noob bouncer who didn't believe it was me in my ID (I still have the vertical under 21 California ID) and was such a stupid about it. I even pulled my hair back like in the photo. The rest of my group got to go ahead and I had to wait for another bouncer to come over. The other bouncer comes over, takes one look at my ID, wishes me happy birthday, asks some questions, and apologizes for noob bouncers stupidity. Girl when you are a 5'8 thick asian\/latina girl and the bouncer believes the ID is real but not you, you gotta be a little upset. Where else am I gonna find an asian mixed girl that looks like me with that height and weight?! I did not wait until I was 21 to go out, only to be doubted when I finally get to 21. lol waste of 10 minutes. Anyways I'm being a diva. But watch out and try to look like your ID ladies. They will kick you out if you don't know all the info on your ID, even if it is you. Good thing I still remembered my old address in SF, down to the zipcode...

Anyways we get in and it's a beautiful club! It's huge and gorgeous and the outside was beautiful. It never got too crowded (cough cough Marquee), but yet I felt like there were a million people there! Smells a little raunchy though. Beautiful people who forgot their deodorant! lol

The bar is efficient. Expensive though! $23 for two bottles of water! Nearly passed out. I forgot what the birthday girl ordered us drinks wise but it was sort of weak. Yummy, but weak.

You can literally dance and sit anywhere! On top of tables, on a raised pedastal with a stripper pole (which is where our group danced!), in the islands between the VIP section. No bouncers kicking you off anything. Amazing. My feet survived the whole night! I LOVE THIS CLUB JUST FOR THAT

The photos and reviews speak for themselves, but I'm actually going to write about the MIRACLE the lovely restroom attendant performed on Sunday night. While I was on the dance floor, the front strap of my heel ripped, rendering my heels useless. I was disappointed because I loved these shoes and did NOT want to leave the club so early on my last night in Vegas.

I lost hope, but went to the ladies room to see if there was any chance that my shoe can be saved. The restroom attendant (I forgot her name, boo!) heard me out, sifted through that magic bag of hers and whipped out super glue. Less than five minutes later, my heels were intact and I ended up dancing for another hour or two before leaving with the girls. My heels are STILL intact and I am still in utter amazement!

sucks that even girls have to pay though :\ unless you can weasel your way to join a table reservation, which my friends did lol. girls are usually $20, guys range from $30-50 in my experience. in the three times i've gone, it seems like friday night are most optimal to get guys in (since bouncers WILL turn you away if the ratio of guy-to-girl isn't at least 1-2). saturday nights are almost impossible to get guys in, unless you go early, get your hand stamped, and enter through the re-entry line later in the night (which is what we did also! ...damn guys).

nice area, pretty big dance floor with table seatings kind of encasing the dance floor, so you get lots of quiet guys drinking their beers and watching girls get down on the dance floor. on super busy nights, it is near impossible to maneuver; once you lose your girl friends, i suggest making friends with the groups close by, because it it'll be awhile before you guys are united.

you better watch out on super busy nights too, because you can easily get groped all over. which i was a victim to :\

1 bar inside, 2 bars outside (xs is indoor\/outdoor). the outdoor area definitely gives more personal space, and there are couches in the pool where people can sit and catch their breaths.... or take self portraits :). there's this center gazebo thing where there's another bar, but the pool acts as sort of a moat, so it gets superrr packed and cramped in there. 

the bartenders COULD be a little bit nicer though :\ i mean, i understand that everyone's drunk and they probably get one too many belligerent drunks coming at them, but there are the select few of us that are sincerely trying to be friendly towards them. price for drinks are about the same as any other club, mayyybe a couple bucks more per shot.

i would probably choose xs over surrender (they're both in the same hotel; encore). i've never actually been to surrender, but the cover's higher and my friend tells me it's just like xs, but more of a lounge than a club. i don't really like paying to get into a place to sit, and pay for more drinks :\ but maybe that's just me.",1,1,0

House music seems to be overtaking hip hop in Vegas so I have to brace for that, but even still, who plays like 10 seconds of a song then changes to the next track? Just enough time for people to yell ""Oh I love this song!"" and then it mixes away. And I wasn't the only one in my group, or on the dance floor, that was frustrated by that.

Its so popular and everyone talks about it, but dancing to the mix they have there always feels like work, where I have to tell myself to just go with the beat and try to have fun. I'd prefer going to a dance club where you can't help BUT dance. 

The pool is pretty and sometimes they let you go in. I was confused one night where people were dressed for the beach and still getting in the club. Guess I didn't get the memo for a pool party, I would have rather worn comfortable sandals than my heels. Makes me want to bring my swim suit in my purse every time... just in case.

I went to Vegas back in August of this year and it was absolutely the best time of my life! My friends and I went to XS on a Monday night for ""Dim Mak"" Mondays to see of course, the one and only Steve Aoki! It was hands down, the best time in a nightclub I had in awhile. I'm from NYC and saying this means A LOT. You know NYC has a lot of great clubs and such but nothing, NOTHING compared to XS. We had free champagne thanks to Aoki's performance and of course some free cake! (Aoki fans know what I'm talking about!) 

Admission for ladies was free of course, especially if you know a promoter. The ratio thing is a really big deal, and I don't blame promoters for asking for a lot of girls because a room full of dudes could get kinda weird. My guy friends paid $20 to get in, probably better than some guys who didn't have any promoter buddies and ended up paying up $40-$60 .. just to get in. So get a promoter, boys and a lot of girlies. The more girls, the easier guys can get in for a cheap price or even free! 

Next time I'm in vegas, I will be coming back! The people are sexy, the DJs are crazy and drinks get you drunk. I really need to stay at the Encore or Wynn to make it much easier to get back to the hotel room after experiencing XS.

the inside of the club looks just like Tryst, but then when you walk outside, its a HUGE pool area with TONS and TONS of places where you can sit and chill. there are these round couches alongside the pool that are used for bottle service, but of course when its not being used, its free for all.  i loved the couch\/lounge chairs that were along the INSIDE of the pool! so you can actually take your shoes off and dip your feet in there. this is especially nice for the ladies cuz you know how painful it is to wear heels all night.

As for the club factor...the dance floor...it could have been better...e.g. bigger. In addition, the music just sucked!

Decided to spend New Years opening up the biggest club on the Strip ... good idea. 

This club is amazing, unlike anything i've ever seen before. Its behemoth size is reason alone to come check out the club. 

You'll find XS tucked in the Esplanade of shops of the Encore, which is actually connecting the Wynn and Encore. We arrived fairly early, with lines forming along the shop windows, and there were already a lot of people waiting to get in. 

Virtual Walkthrough:

Once you pass the doorman and cashier, you're immediately ushered into a realm of sheer luxury and beauty. A coat check sits to your immediate left as you walk though the brilliant gold entryway. The walls are adorned with life-sized nude female reliefs trying to escape the wall and into the party scene ahead. Once you round the corner you can see all of XS in is brilliant glory, tables, dance floor, bars, spinning disco-chandelier that all lead to the pool, island, and cabanas. 

XS is set up identically to Tryst; once you enter if you proceed down the middle you will find yourself on the huge dance floor. Upon entry, however, if you veer to the right, you will find the restrooms and the bar. To the left, it is almost identical with the bar on the left. The space between the walkway and dance floor are littered with tables; it's almost endless. 

The real jewel of XS is (what I will refer to as) the Backyard. XS houses its own private pool complete with outdoor tables, day beds, and, of course cabanas (2 stories of them!) To the right of the pool you will find another bar and to the right of the bar, a staircase to access the second floor of cabanas. Directly behind the pool sits a little island complete with its own bar, and, yes, table games. There are maybe a dozen tables lined up (mostly blackjack) to enjoy while in the nightclub. There is ample, ample space to wander, frolic, and get lost, and there were even tables, bar stools, and heat lamps set up in the back for dancers whose feet started to ache. 

My thoughts:

XS reminded me way too much of Tryst; it had an IDENTICAL layout. The only difference is XS is almost quadruple the size, and replace the waterfall with a pool and backyard play area. However, I must say the no attention to detail has been spared. From the different textures of the couches of table surface (not sure it is was REAL crocodile, but it sure felt like it), the lush cabanas, the spinning fans inside, the amazing bar nudes, or the 10ft rotating chandelier\/light\/disco-ball, XS is truly an excess of beauty, attention, and detail. 

Because I was here for NYE and the grand opening of the club, it was packed and all the tables were sold. However, I can hardly imagine this place reaching capacity and selling all 200 of its tables on just any given night. 

Perhaps the real charm and splendor of XS will be exhibited when the cold winter nights pass and bring on the warm dessert sun. It has been said that XS will open in the afternoon with the party outside, continuing to the wee hours of the morning, being able to utilize both portions of the club (I will still find it hard to fill up the entire space ... 90% of the people were inside on NYE). 

Bottom Line:

If you like Tryst (which I do), you will most definitely love XS. It is a sight to see and an experience unlike anything else. I did enjoy the fact that when tables were not in use or ""reserved"" you were free to sit. Also, did I mention the club as at least half a dozen stripper poles scattered around? We know girls + booze + stripper poles = great times, and XS capitalized on this fact! A few poles are exclusive to certain tables, but we found about 4 that were open to the public (and when I say public, I mean the ladies).

We met up with one of the hosts who graciously set us up for a decent section along the grass area. We kicked off our flip-flops and danced barefoot on the lawn under the vegas flourescent lights. Bottle service was stuffy, naturally- er, unaturally DD's, but we made the best of it. 

Note: Care for a dip in the pool? By all means, they encourage it! 
Our stay at Encore helped us skip lines and lessened the cover charge for the men in our group.",1,1,1

Great venue but they really shouldn't have placed the DJ booth in-between the dance floor and pool view. It cut off one of the major veins to outside so the side door was one big traffic jam.
Cover is $30 for girls & $50 for guys but you can talk your way down if you got females with you (unless they're fugly!), just see one of the line hosts. Also try to find passes on the strip, which may or may not work. The line is usually long but it moves swiftly and be prepared to WAIT for drinks too.

First time we have ever been to XS.  Must say it is a good size and the combination of a pool area with the inside club is coming to be pretty common in Vegas nowadays.  

The club inside was immaculate.  It was clean and shiny all throughout.  The inside part of the club itself is not very big but the outside area helps somewhat with overcrowding.  Nevertheless the flow is alright in order to get from one area to the next once it is full.  There is always a stream of people walking both directions. The bartenders are very fast and easy on the eyes and the drinks were better than at other popular night clubs in Vegas.

Due to the fact that Avicii was playing that Friday night, the dance floor was utter chaos; people pushing, shoving, and fights breaking out.  I guess that is what happens when you are at the very front.  Needless to say we had to leave 1 hour into Avicii's set due to the overwhelming pressure\/pushing from all the people behind us.  Went out side grabbed some drinks and continued our night.  Overall it was a learning experience; we had a better time the next night when Tiesto played.  We would go back to XS but when they have only their resident playing, Warren Peace.

After waiting in the crazy line that started filling up around 8:45pm on a Saturday night, bending over in submission to the rude\/scary\/ridiculous bouncers (don't even THINK about cutting in line...they will chew your heads off), and paying $20 cover ($30 for gents), we finally got stamped and made our way into the hottest nightclub in Vegas.  

My eyes lit up\/dilated as the images in my head from hours of research on Yelp\/Youtube days before became a reality.  This place is HYUGE.  We walked outside and my jaw dropped.  The crystal clear, sparkling pool softly lit by heating lamps, couches floating on top of the water literally SURROUNDED by tables and private rooms for bottle service, and the bar on the other side filled with blackjack\/war tables for guests to throw some more money away at, had my blood pumping and heart racing from excitement-overload.  

I think I enjoyed my time even more, initially, because we got in early when it was empty.  So, we had a good moment alone with XS to slowly undress it and go bonkers.

Expensive drinks but hey... it's Vegas.  Don't even think about getting a drink at the bar when it's packed... faster to go outside and play slots for free drinks than at the bar here... After waiting 20~ min, we decided to bounce before the smell of fresh throw-up on the ground pushed us over the edge into yaksville... 

Side note: If someone starts a fight or gets rowdy here, bouncers will be on you like white on rice and you'll get kicked out of the hotel.  My advice is to keep a cool head and just have a good time... and lay off the tequila.  

Another side note:  This girl was so drunk she slipped and fell... busting her face up... there was blood on the floor and it got on my friends arm... talk about a wild night!  AND my friend got punched in the face by this donk... !!  Hence, the above disclaimer...",4,3,3

Subsequently, said member was then kicked out of the club for ""profanity and cursing""  when no such behavior actually  occurred. When asked for proof of 'profanity and cursing"" against the bouncers, none could be provided. Guests requested to speak to upper management, but were then denied and directed to the same incompetent staff that had falsely accused guests.

A large group of us went on a Sat night, and the guys, even if on the guest list, had to pay for cover. $30 on a sat night, is pretty reasonable though, especially given the 5 star entertainment and service you'll experience inside.

The music was great, and the crowd is plenty fun. The pool area is a nice cool off spot, and you'll always catch a DB slip in because they're just that intoxicated.

Whenever my feet start hurting from dancing, we always dip in the pool to cool down, haha.

Yes, they will treat you differently if you come as a group of girls vs. a group of guys or a group of girls & guys. Best treatment is if you're with a group of girls and have a promoter's contact. You will probably get in for free and get 1 free drink ticket. You might even get a table with drinks included. If you're in a group of only guys, you're probably better off buying a table.  If you come with these expectations and make it into the club without letting their door policies bother you too much, then you will have a good time... I mean, this is pretty much the same for wherever you go in Vegas or NYC.

Place is pretty big with indoor & outdoor\/pool areas.  If you go on a Saturday night, dress your best. Ladies, if you don't have a table and need somewhere to sit, try the booths inside... There's a ledge behind the booths where you can sit and take a break from your high heels. Sunday is night swim, so the dress code is pretty casual\/relaxed and everyone is pretty much in the pool areas. Inside areas were kinda dead since everyone was outside, but that means you can sit at any inside booth without having to buy bottles. But the DJ will be facing out towards the pool.

Music is 99% EDM since that's what's popular right now. Kaskade was there when we went on a Saturday and he was great, kept the party going till almost closing time. 

Bathroom line for women moved pretty quickly as they have multiple stalls and a staff member would usually go in and tidy up the stall before letting someone else in.

We ended up dancing the night away...or in my case, sitting on a comfy couch, sipping on some Tequila and watching Diplo from our TV screen inside the cabana the remainder of the night.

This was actually my second time at XS and I have to admit, the DJs they have coming through here are legit and the music is always on point.

i didn't like the music at all thus 2 stars. 

here is why: 

there has been a conspiracy that there are TOO many asians in the club. so that being said, i did see a lot of asians. not sure if that's the reason, but music SUCKED. they only played techno throughout the night and not much hip-hop (my friend, wm's theory is because asians like hip-hop, they don't play much anymore). 

the place is super crowded to the point a wild couple next to me  who was bumping and grinding constantly thrown me to the other side - to my friend who was dancing in front of me -- and a lot of sticky hands all around. thank GOODNESS we didn't have to pay to get in (thanks wm! you da bomb!) nor wait in line, otherwise, i would have been super pissed for coming to xs. 

next time, i'd rather hit moon in palms. it's small and not as popular, but at least they have a better dj.  if you like hip-hop, do not go.

The first time I arrived happened to be on a summer time Sunday Nightswim with Major Lazer. I went with an LA friend who had been here a couple times previously. He took care of my ticket (I found out later it was $40 for me, $60 for him at the door!) after waiting 45 mins at the door. I was never even aware there is such a thing as a promoter, must call one next time! 

Once we breezed in around 12:30 it was fairly packed, and we were dressed up. It was really odd to be in line all dressed up next to people wearing swim trunks and mesh shirts LOL but once we were in I understood why, there's a huge pool open on Nightswim nights! (I still wouldn't have dressed up in pool attire though no telling what disease you might come out of that pool with, not to mention spilled drinks, possibly vomit from people who pregamed too hard, etc.) 

Went straight for the bar next to the exit to the outside. Took us a few minutes of waiting behind a guy who was rolling hard and grabbing beers before we were served by a cute Asian bartender. Beautiful. She got our stuff to us in no time. Shots of tequila here go for $15 each, with mixed drinks $17+ but hey, when in Vegas. We smiled and paid and got to the outside area with our mixed drinks for the last sets of the DJ. 

By the time I finished my White Russian everything was perfect. Sure it was crowded right in front of the DJ booth but we could easily be at the front. The lights, the music were amazing and the crowd was vibing. Major Lazer came on along with his bootyful go go dancers to a blast of fire and lights. We stayed until 3:30 right before they closed for the night. 

What I recommend wearing in the summer: ladies, it gets hot outside so if you're going to be outside, dress accordingly. A nice skimpy dress with manageable heels shows you off best and leaves room for dancing. Hair up might keep you from sweating but that's on you. Gentlemen, a dark button-up perhaps (no ties) because you will have women wearing fifty shades of makeup rubbing against you accidentally while you\/they move through the crowd. If you want to wear the shirt again, make it a dark one, but not black because you'll look like a bouncer. Slack color is up to you. Nice comfortable shoes. And loosen up, you're at a club, talk to women if you like, don't just stare, we don't bite. The best opener is a smile, if she smiles back, ask her how her night is going. 

After coming here a few more times my advice to you: pregame before going in, keep your stuff to yourself, if you're a female bring a larger purse if at any time you feel like you may dip your feet into the pool. So many heels ruined by being shoved to the side where they are stepped on while owners are drunk dipping their feet in the pool to cool down. If you find a wallet or personal item abandoned or on the ground bring it to the front, everyone you ask will lie and say it's theirs. When going with drinks in the crowd (especially a couple shots in each hand) put them high above your head so nobody spills them and people see you coming. I recommend not swimming during crowded night swims unless you trust every party goer intimately. Stay away from those who are rolling unless you're one of them lol. The bar inside serves much faster than the one outside, with friendlier bartenders too. And lastly call a promoter goddammit nobody should spend that much on cover and drinks!",0,0,0

We went on Sunday night, which is industry night. We waited no longer than 5 minutes to get into the club. It was crowded, but not to the point where it was annoying. There was a diverse group of people, many who were there to just dance and have a good time. 

We sat at a table outside for awhile. Even though it was cold, the heaters kept us warm. Some of our friends decided they wanted to dance and a couple other tables of people got up and danced with us as well. 0verall, it was a good night. 

I would come again on industry night...skip all of the tourists\/annoying drunk people who come out on Friday and Saturday nights and wait in ridiculously long lines.

Big time DJ faux pas. Come on now, there are billions of songs out there, we can't be more creative? Plenty of electronic music with very little hip hop and R&B. Musically its just not really my steeze.

And sweet baby jesus, why do they allow people to dance on the ledges? Upon my last visit our group bought bottle service by the dance floor and there were @ least 3 separate incidences where someone fell and\/or spilled their damn drink on me and\/or crushed a female friend as we were seated in the booth.

The only redeeming quality is the outdoor space, which is set up quite nicely. There's a pool in the middle and I was really hoping that some smug butthole would get pushed into it. Alas, he or she did not, therefore keeping this review at one star. 

Who wants to spend thousands of dollars on a ""cabana"" when I can have the same private experience in my parent's basement? Invite some friends over and blast some techno... done. At least I wouldn't have money hungry hoes preying on my overpriced bottles of mediocre liquor.

I walked through the dance floor and from what I remember the music wasn't my usual hip hop\/rap scene but it was enough to wiggle my drunk ass.

Cover was $50 for guys, and $20 for girls, but it was so worth it. I would definitely recommend buying tickets ahead of time if you can; you get to skip the huge normal line and go right to the front with a ~5 - 10 minute wait.

The club was super packed inside and consequently insane. I bought 2 AMF's, which were $17 each and pretty strong (a good thing if you're paying $17 for a drink...).

MUSIC - Music is the most important part to me at a club. I came on a Friday with a group of friends, and even though its the coolest, newest thing over in europe and starting to slowly make its way over to the states, most of the night it played alot of electro fist pumping david guetta type music which to me isnt that dancable (aka grindable).

ROOM \/ AMENITIES - Very spacious, there were poles located around the room for girls to dance on, and also there were always continuously 2 girls in the front dancing on a elevated riser. There's a pool in the background next to the outside patio place where you can have tables. Its a very classy place. 
I went to the bathroom, and they have all these different types of perfumes and mints for you to use afterwards! So cool. Never been to a nightclub (outside of vegas) That had that. 

ETC - I came a little earlier on in the night (11pm) so the lines weren't that long then, but when we left or when we would walk out to take a breather, the line definitely got longer. But there were always alot of people in the club. 
Like alot of people said, I expected this hyped up nightclub to give us alot of trouble \/ a long wait in line in order to get in, but everything went pretty smoothly and quickly. It is pretty expensive though. Ladies, if you can get one of those free ladies passes from those street vendors on the streets definitely do. But men had to pay $20 entrance fee.

Also definitely *DRESS TO IMPRESS* you don't wanna look shabby inside this club. I think it would live up to its hype if it played more ghetto booty music (aka hip hop).  

Note: i cannot review the drinks because I didn't order any; we pregamed the club thinking the drinks would be too expensive.

OVERALL - I would definitely recommend this club because it's actually really classy architecture and i loved the layout, esp with the pool (that wasn't open that night) and the outdoor patio where you could walk around. Theres always a shit ton of people though, so be prepared for that. Hopefully the music is much better \/ grindable for yall when you visit, and hopefully the drinks are good and reasonably priced too. but the people are definitely HOT and there to IMPRESS. so you do the same too, aites? :]",1,1,1

So luckily the line was under a roof though outdoors and we were able to get through it quickly. The catch? They wouldn't let us indoors without a third stamp from the admission line (our guest list status got us 2 worthless stamps). The bouncers wouldn't even tell us  how\/when\/where to get this third stamp.

Ok ok first off if you're a girl let me tell you something you should not be paying. Why you ask? they have get in free ladies passes that you can use. and yes the girls we were with used them. They are good before 12. You can get them on ebay for about 50cents or free in random places around vegas. Take the time to save yourself 20 bucks a girl. Yes guys will have to pay 30 bucks to get in. 

So when we got there... Around 9:30. We saw a line of about 300 people. Usually in vegas that spells 3hour wait. THE MOST AMAZING THING WAS it only took 5-10 minutes to get in.... There werent douche bag bouncers running up and down the line selecting people to go in. This place is so big that they have to let as many people in as possible to make it look packed.

So Once you get in the inside of the club looks like a bigger version of tryst with a dance floor in the middle and bottle service all around. (Mental note: do not get bottle service unless you get at least 4 bottles) We saw people with bottles who were sitting at a little table in front of a planter hahaha sad really sad. There are plenty of places to sit at Xs even if it's just a planter. If you get there early enough there are mattresses on the edge of the pool which are for anyone to sit on. First come first serve. 

On the other side of the pool which faces the club there is a giant bar. that has bj tables and craps tables for those who would rather not dance. There is plenty of places to sit. Let me emphasize that because most places in vegas you have to get bottle service so that you can sit somewhere. Everyone can lounge sit around and talk and it's all great! Drinks are pricey but that is to be expected. 14 dollar shots and 17 dollar mix drinks. Not for the poor for sure. 

There is one down side to this club. There is only one dance room that plays a lot of house music with a little hip hop mixed in. The one dance floor is not quite big enough. Once midnight passes the dance floor is packed and you will get hit. The outside exposed area also becomes packed and filled with people so it becomes a little hard to maneuver around. The next sucky thing is that there arent enough bar tenders working the bar. It can take upto 10-20 mins to get a drink later in the night. Usually only 1-2 bar tenders per bar area. 

All and all a very fun place to go where you can hang out and talk with friends in places where the music isnt too loud... or you can go dance where the music is loud... you can gamble if you are there because your friends forced you to go. Probably one of the hands down best clubs most people will ever go to.",2,0,0

I went this past Friday night with a group of girlfriends. We were lucky enough to have a connection to one of the club hosts who was able to walk us in with no cover charge or wait. This contrasts with some other clubs in vegas, where perhaps we have a host to walk us in, but they still place us in a line to wait before we can actually walk on in. We arrived before 11pm, the line for tables looked long, the general admission line didn't look too bad. 

The club was amazing! It's a good size, so you don't feel like you are being crushed when you try to dance or walk somewhere. The indoor decor is interesting and impressive - and outside is AMAZING. There is a ton of space outside, plenty of bars, and a beautiful gazebo and pool. For the ladies - there were no or short waits for the restrooms! Later in the night I noticed the mirrors got a bit crowded with hot messes trying to spruce up their makeup\/hair situation, but other than that no issues. 

The music was okay, a weird mix, they played a re-mix of Nirvana which I found very very strange. They also shot money ($1's) into the crowd all night which was just fun. We managed to find a bachelor party which was more than happy to share their table with us, the service for the tables was great, they cleaned up and served drinks very quickly!

Getting in: Of course, easier with more girls. However, if you know someone, you can get the brown passes that get girls in for free. Guys always pay ($30-50 depending on night and time). Some people have also told me that girls even end up paying (they are that popular). Come early to get in.",2,0,0

...Well, if that's the case, toss me a pitchfork and call me a sinner because I love Las Vegas and I especially love XS.

XS just exudes what I expect from Vegas - and that's sin. Just imagine...

It's Saturday night and you and your closest friends are decked out for the night - your hottest outfits, your sexiest shoes, not a single hair or eyelash out of place. (*Pride*)

Where are you going to go? XS.

You strut your pretty selves over to the line at XS. Schmooze a little bit with the bouncers, get yourself to the front of the line, walk through those golden front doors, up the stairs and then...you're there. The room opens up to the hottest club in Las Vegas. Bars to either side, a dancefloor right in front of you and, behind all that, a large pristine pool, with the water glistening under the moonlight.

You and your girls push your way onto the dance floor, find a little space to call your own, immerse yourselves in the music, dance like there's no tomorrow...until you catch a glance of someone out of the corner of your eye. (*Lust*) 

Who is he? 
What's his name? 
...Who is that effing chick all up on him?! 
(*Lust* turns to *Envy*. *Envy* turns to *Wrath*.) 

Wait...breathe. Don't forget, you're at XS - there's plenty of fish in the sea here. If you don't find someone at the beginning of the night, you'll probably find one towards the end.

What if dancing's not your thing? Fine then, get yourself a drink...or two...or ten...(*Gluttony*) 
Don't feel like drinking? There are blackjack tables in the back where you can win your fortunes or lose it all. (*Greed*) 
Are you just tired at the end of the night? Cool your toes in the pool and just lounge around...(*Sloth*)

XS embodies everything I love about Las Vegas.
It's extravagant and beautiful. 
It's classy but debaucherous.
Hey, if you're going to sin, you might as do everything in excess...at XS...",10,16,11

The spaciousness of XS definitely makes it standout from other clubs. The dancefloor itself is still pretty cramped, but since it spills out into the outside there is still plenty of room to hang out or dance by one of the pools, by the poker tables, by the bar, or in the little patio area to the side of everything. You definitely will not be lacking for space in XS.

It may have just been the night, but the music at Tryst seemed to be far better than the music at XS. It was the weekend Michael Jackson died and they played three Madonna songs (including the terrible four minutes to save the world) but no MJ, what gives?

They did score some points though by playing an unreleased Britney Spears track and having what appeared to be a flashback to the set of MTV's The Grind with a Crystal Waters song marathon for a few minutes.",0,0,0

This place is gigantic, the bartender told me it is the biggest club in Vegas too. The cover charge for guys on Saturday nights is currently $50 and $20 for girls, no discounts either, not even for locals. I guess this is what happens when you have the most happening spot in Vegas. The line for this place is legendary so I suggest getting there are 9pm when they open the doors, I know that sounds crazy but unless you enjoy waiting in a lines I would get there early or get bottle service.  FYI, if you get there after 10pm it will be the longest line you have ever waited in your whole life.

But how can I give this place 5 stars, because simply it is by far the best, most amazing club I have been too. With great music and an even better crowd! Honestly if you are in Vegas you have to go here, you will feel like you have walked into a movie. They also have this pool that you cannot go into on Friday and Saturday nights, only ankle deep is allowed. There are no signs about this though so it was funny watching random people get thrown or jump in then escorted out.

There is no room to breathe or do anything on the inside, so that was awful, but it's really nice on the outside in the pool area, and it is so fun to be able to dip your feet in the pool and dance in the water. Hahaha, saw some guy fall in the pool, but he got right up and acted as though everything was normal, which it was -- from the waist up. 

Nice and efficient staff on the outside moving the line through. I got in for free, but my husband had to pay $50 cover. YIKES. 

The decor looked pretty nice, and the bright screen with the jumping colors behind the DJ was pretty cool. 

It was a pretty fun club and a pretty good night. We danced the night away and got home at 4 in the morning. Beware of waiting for 30+ minutes for a cab (yes, even at 4 am!) after getting out of the club. 

Also, there was some confusion as to where to go to get into the club, because there were two entrances to the club. Ask for the main entrance to be safe!

After a long line I sit down, order some delicious food, and pay in advance. As I try to dig in with my utensils they quickly swipe the dish from me and tell me that I have to pay extra to actually eat the food, I only paid enough to have it sit in front of me and smell it. So, I'm here already and I'm not going to go to another restaurant. I pay extra. Then, they inform me that other people have also ordered this dish and I'll have to wait before I can actually eat it. 

So some people will have to pay just to get into XS. But wait! Once you're ""inside"", which is not actually inside a building but outside by their day club area, you have to pay more (100 guys, 50 girls) to actually go into the building where the DJ is playing. Unfortunately, if you're not psychic you will not know this because they do not let you know about this in advance (never have I ever been to another club that charged an additional fee to go inside the BUILDING, not VIP area), but you can still see the DJs back facing you from outside as you feel like a 2nd class citizen. That part about ""having to share the dish""? If you read some other reviews, if even you pay extra you might have trouble getting inside. Say the inside capacity is 100 and the one outside is 100, you can still sell 200 ""inside"" tickets  (not breaking the fire code) but only 100 people will be able to stay inside at once.

I don't think that there is much more that I can add about the club itself - it is quite literally the best club I have ever been to. The decor is classy, its huge, and I love how the smoking area is around the pool.

If you are a large group of guys, then you will not get in without bottle service, so don't even try. And expect to spend a lot of money - we had a group of eight and had a three bottle minimum. Grey Goose or the equivalent runs around $450 a bottle, then you have to include something like 8% tax, and 20% for tip, so it worked out around $600 per bottle. But hey, this is Vegas, and you're supposed to do stupid sh!t like that.

I emailed the club to sort out a table directly, but you could use a third party promoter who may be able to get you a deal on bottles on the quieter nights. I wouldn't count on getting any deal on a Friday or Saturday though. Once they have your details, when you turn up you will see a sign for table service - so you walk past everyone in the regular line and get taken straight to your table - when you see how long this line is then you will probably think that $600 a bottle is worth it...

Once inside, where your table is depends on how much $$$ you are prepared to pay, but I recommend getting a table outside. It can get pretty hot in the club, and very loud, so not exactly the best way to meet the ladies. Outside is not as hectic, and gives you a chance to socialize with people.

Now for the reason that this place doesn't get five stars.

*Although most of the staff were really friendly, they do have some that think their sh!t don't stink. Basically telling people that unless you give a big tip, don't expect to get served. And to the girl behind the bar who charged me something like $210 for 10 Jagerbombs - if I hand you $300 and say keep the change, it would be nice to get a thank you rather then just throwing it into a tip bucket and carrying on (I'm English so don't know how tipping works in the US, but thats a pretty good tip right?)

*The girls. Yes they are hot. Really hot. So you have to know that unless you look like Justin Timberlake, then they aren't interested in you - it's the three bottles of Goose you have sat on your table. Either tell them to p!ss off, or pour them a drink and take your chance. I mean, I guess sometimes people win big in Vegas right?

*Some guys look like they are straight off of Jersey Shore. Surely someone should tell them that wearing an eight year old girls tight white t shirt is not a good look, with or without big muscles.

All in all, I would come back to this club in a heartbeat. I had one of the greatest nights ever. The only problem I had - having to get up in the morning with a killer hangover, only to do it all over again in a Bungalow at Encore Beach Club!",7,13,5

Get there, walk in through table reservation line, easy walk in, get seated outside by the pool. Nice table, cool night, good music. good stuff.  Tip your host. 

However, then the shady stuff starts. My boy puts the bill on his card. They come back and say his card has been rejected. He shows them his bank account as prove that there must be a mistake. At this point I don't blame the girl, there could have been some issue when running the card. 

Waited for over 30 minutes to get this sorted out. Won't budge. There are some friendly Brits at the table across form us. They come over and in their cool cheeky accents (""Pip Pip Cheerio"") tell us they are having the same problem even though they have more than enough funds.

Another group happens to over hear and says they are having the same problem at their table and there are some girls at another table they just spoke to having the same issue... really XS? I highly doubt broke ass people are going to go through all this trouble just to get rejected after they get seated. 

Knowing how the business works some what I start figuring they want to hold the tables for larger groups with bigger minimums. The night was getting started so I'm sure they could have easily filled those slots if one of us had budge. I put the bill on my card, I definitely have more than the required funds. No issue. All of a sudden all the other cards start working. Just seem pretty shady to me. 

Other than that everything was cool. Good music, good fun. 

Its Vegas. Money talks and people are shady. Make sure you ask all the required questions before you agree to anything. what minimum? what table location will that minimum get you? Arrival time? Is the table yours the entire night? etc. Sometimes its just people being dicks trying to get a tip or force you spend more. Don't budge.

I also had a free admission pass and they took it with no problems or hassles.  I'm pretty sure that this is because it was a Sunday so YMMV.

The club looks just like Tryst.  I think the layout is almost identical.  Sure XS as the stripper poles, etc. but overall the layout is pretty much the same.

The music was mediocre at best.  The DJ played mostly house\/trance and sometimes mixed in some hip hop.  The worst was the random gaps lasting 3-5 seconds of just pure silence between mixes.  Everyone on the dance floor basically just looked at each other until the next song started.

Overall, good party vibe though for a Sunday night.  I like the crowd at Tryst and Pure much more.",1,1,0

came by to some ridiculous system of VIP, regular line, lines for solos, lines for just women, and lines for groups that had more women than men

can you sexism? and how smart is it to have a club full of women with a ratio of 10-1 and thirsty guys jumping from one to the other?

our group was thrown to the general line because we had one more girl than guy and said screw it because we were told we had to pay $30\/person

We entered through the back\/pool area. View, vibe, and atmosphere are awesome and great to party in. Drinks are expensive, and the only thing that got me to buy them was being under the influence and partying with the homies. Venue is nice and there were also gambling tables (craps, 21, etc) towards the very back and I thought that was nice touch.It gets a bit crowded towards the front behind the set\/stage behind whoever is performing and it got difficult moving around. It's possible you can fall into the pool in certain parts. 

Having mentioned coming in for free, because of this you are not allowed to go inside. First I was a little upset about this, but in the end, it didn't matter because you could see how hot and sweaty people were inside.

Unless I win big in Vegas, I'll never buy a bottle or reserve a place to sit. Forgot the exact number, but a bottle has to be split between 3 people, and each bottle was $200+ (or 600?) and our group was 18 of us. There was no way all of us were going to pay for that.

Let me start with that the decor and the indoor\/outdoor areas are simply fantastic. I love the layout, I love the pool area, and I love the lighting. Just a great look to it all. But, as I said in another review - I am a bit of a music snob, so take the following as you will.

What the hell? 

The music at XS was just...not great. Not even really GOOD. Now, I was there on a Friday, so I can't speak to the Saturday music\/DJ, but on Friday it was just bad. Eurotrash remixes, no flow, just iffy mixing, and no real fluidity. I know everything in Vegas is clubbed up and bigger and more kitschy. But this was simply not good.

Now, the drinks were great (and not terribly priced either). The line was well organized, moved quickly, and I couldn't complain about much else. I just think the music dictates the vibe, and the music just wasn't there.

What I think XS has over other clubs is:
* Reputation - XS has a reputation of being fun and crazy. I think that it draws those crazies looking to party hard.
* Best DJs - The flip side is that because of their reputation, XS attracts the best DJ period. I have heard several awesome DJs here and they change it up frequently. As many times as I have been here, we have yet to have a repeat.
* Location - I think being in the Wynn with the other top clubs (Tryst and Surrender) in Vegas helps out a lot. Wynn and Encore even though by day seems like hotels for old people... by night, it nothing but clubbing d-bag and young hotties.
* Layout of the club - the layout of this place is perfect. Dance floor in the center with tables and little places to chill extending outward in repeating half circles. Bars on the outer circle to get drinks.
* Club Goers - I have already mentioned it, but the girls that come to XS are usually on different level than other clubs. The chicks are dressed to impress and way hotter.

The only drawback to XS is there aren't enough bars or places to get a drink in my opinion. They only have 2 main ones in the back on opposite ends. Just a minor gripe. Nothing tops XS and I will definitely be coming back in my future trips to Vegas.",1,1,1

One of them looks like it's across on an island (it's not really an island) and you can even gamble there too!

there's a lot of baller looking outside arrangements as well, as in lots of diff sofas, sort of in the pool itself as well as beds for folks who don't mind an audience (you know who you are)

weak drinks...

Best part: every friday there's this old guy, prob in his late 60's that just grooves like nobody's business. He's the man. And he let me take a picture with him!

Worst part: the music is basically suited to sorority girls that ""just wanna dance"" and by that i mean flail to beats that are either too fast or too bad for you to actually want to dance with someone to.

music was pathetic top 40 remixes i expect out of my home town (san diego) but anticipated much more out of the grand vegas. i know that isn't the case every night, but was my experience.

Most las Vegas clubs are pretty cool at taking care of locals but not XS. I came to XS with my bf for night swim. When we walked in the line, we made the bouncers know that we are local. They said the line will be about an hour but we will get in for free. Since we are getting in for free, I asked is there anyway we can get in the faster line since we will be taken care of. One of the bouncer said there is a way and he said that with douche look on his face. I didn't know what it means until about an hour wait in line where no body was moving except a few people and we wondered why. We discovered that some bouncers are asking people if they want in faster line, they can pay $25 extra. I was curious to whether that $25 would go to the club or not. But ofcourse, it went straight to the bouncer pocket. I believe in tipping the bouncer sometimes when they are nice to you and give you good service but this is straight up asking people for money and scamming. They are obviously holding line so they can ask people for money. I am a girl so I don't have a problem getting in but I still think this is the unethical scam that this people are running. I studied hospitality and I am not sure what kind of business these club management is allowing it's employees to do. I hope that this issue will be fixed.

One huge change they made is the DJ stage they put up.  The dance floor used to have access to outside, but they put the stage there so you have to walk around the sides to get outside.  Another change they made is booking these big name DJ's to put on stage.  I also noticed the set-up for the line for XS has changed.  

So, I came here over the weekend for a friend's birthday, and we got bottle service for 12 people.  A little disappointed at the location and size of our table.  Our table could only seat 5 people, and the table was outside, so we couldn't see the DJ perform from our table.  You'd think we'd get a better table for spending a few racks.  Maybe it's because we reserved out table only a week ahead, probably should have done that a month before.  Other than that I had a great time; I was feeling myself.

Sebastian Ingrosso was spinning that night, and I have to say he tore it up.  The DJ stage is definitely an upgrade.  Actually feels like the dance floor is bigger.  I must have spent the first 2-3 hours at the table drinking because by the time I got out to the dance floor, I was on. And once I got to the dance floor I didn't leave.  The music was so on point.  It had me fist pumping and jumping for another 2-3 hours straight.  I didn't even mention the lights.  It was like an upscale mini rave in that piece.  Only qualm about the music was it was electronic all night.  I would have liked a little hip hop to bump and grind with the ladies.

I would give XS 4 stars, but here's where they earned a bonus star.  The first time I had bottle service at XS was a couple years ago, and one of the people in our group was over and passed out at our table.  Security then proceeded to kick that person out of the club.  This week was completely different.  We had not one but TWO people that were completely faded and passed out at the table AND it was before midnight.  Security didn't approach to us once!

I, as well as my girls, always have a great time at XS. They are pretty accommodating when it comes to getting you on the guest list and getting you through the lines. Except those people in purple jackets. They are like a Line Nazi. So mean. 
I've been coming here since they opened, so I've seen a lot of chances from moving the guest list line, headliner DJs, night swims, bottle services and offerings of 2-drink tickets for the ladies. Sadly, as I age, the crowd stays young. And then you'll have the 22-23 yr. old guys swarming a bachelorette party trying to ""score one.""

XS stays classy, the venue, not the crowd. I love the huge outdoor space. The center bar surrounded by the pool and the tables for those that have some itchy hands are the areas I enjoy hanging out that.

One word, IMMACULATE!  XS is by far the BEST looking nightclub in Las Vegas!  

- Decided to go to XS nightclub @ The Encore on a Friday evening (March 6).  As you approach the XS entrance, you'll notice the clientele you will be dealing with throughout the evening. Dress to impress is a MUST and DO NOT take this lightly.
- There were 11 of us (guys) in total celebrating a bachelor party.
- The reservation was for 3 bottles based on 11 individuals situated right in front of the dance floor on the outside. Heated lamps by our table but to be honest, once you've had a fair amount of drinks, your temp rises anyway ;)
- Love the concept of an open patio which allows the club to air itself out and gives club goers the ability to walk around the pool. 
- Even during peak times, I was able to walk in and out of the patio area (where our booth was) from the inside of the club.
- Our waitress and the other XS staff managing our table did a commendable job that evening.
- Once all the bottles were completely dried out, we still held onto our table and partied until approximately 4am.
- Music was mashups, house and top 40 and our crew had no issues with the flow.
- Outside pool area with a gambling area & cabanas is worth checking out throughout the evening.  I know REHAB & TAO Beach have the summer season on lock down but XS can definitely compete but I guess we'll see this summer.

Highlight of my evening was battling and dancing house with one of the many people I had met that evening and meeting Jermaine Dupri (aka. JD) of course.

Overall, the experience (for us) at XS was first-class and I definitely recommend bottle service especially if you're dealing with just guys (ie. bachelor party).

The Las Vegas anthem for us this past weekend was ""Blame It"" by Jamie Foxx feat. T-Pain......""Blame it on the Goose!.....""  Ya dig! ;)",2,0,2

My twin sister, fiance and I came here on Monday night, walked right up to those shiny doors and did not pay a cover! (Please note: we got there at 9:45pm) 

There were Go-Go dancers everywhere in golden little dresses, stripper poles everywhere, a bar at every corner, outside lounge area next to the pool, another bar in the center of the pool with blackjack tables and another Go-GO dancer.....this place is gorgeous! Finally, a nightclub that has it right. The people here are friendly, my sister made some friends with a few guys and invited us to come party at their table, even my fiance was invited! We went through 3 bottles of Grey Goose! It was great night! I will definitely be back.

Drinks: $18-$22 for premium cocktails 
Shots $13.00

This place was beautiful....I spent most of my time in the outdoor area because outside of all the things they did right, they put the dance floor right in the middle of the club which was the only way to get outside..Which was not cool it was like diving underwater and holding your breath till you get to from one end of the pool to the other...like my other yelpers stated, for such a huge place, the dance floor is small for the amount of people that are cuttin' the rug. 

I guess it's fortunate for XS but this place was PACKED on Saturday and it was real hard to maneuver though a crowd of drunken, techno and house dancers....hence the 4 star rating. The music was not to my liking but because there was so much more to this place, I am still a fan. 

The people were all cool. We befriended some people from Mexico City who let us kick it at their table and shared their bottle service. (that I must say was FABULOUS) They had ""BALLERS"" written all over them as mostly everyone did here. This ain't no jeans and nice shirt place, folks were dressed to impress and just down right chill. 

You got to go. I don't have any advice about lines and cover charges that is just the deal. We stood in line for 40 minutes and got in for free (that's how we roll), we even managed to get some gentlemen who where in line with us in for free...they were psyched!

It might sound kinda funny and dramatic but here it goes... 

I was on the dancefloor and Celebrity guest DJ Will.I.Am just got on stage and there was a bum rush to the front of the stage since everyone wanted to be close to him. My foot got stepped on by a girl with stilletos. I felt it and it didn't hurt too much at first, but then I started feeling a warm liquid on my toes and it started burning! I touched my foot and there was blood on my hand! I got my friends to rush me to the bathroom and we noticed my toenail had come off and I left a trail of blood on the the bathroom floor. Really gross and embarrassing! My friends were panicking and cleaning off the ground and helping me wipe off the blood. The bathroom attendant was pissed and wouldn't lend us anymore paper towels and wouldn't give me a bandaid until we gave her tip money for the paper towels we used. A security guard was kind and brought me to first aid. The first aid was really rude and made me feel embarrassed for being there. They seemed really bored when I got there and I think they were bummed I wasn't a very exciting case. I felt like I was an annoyance to them and that they thought I was a wuss for even seeing them.

That's about the number of years I've been going to Xs and I honestly cannot remember how many times I have been here.  It's a pretty decent number of times, but hey with age comes wisdom, so here's my two cents about what I think is Vegas's best club.

Hands down this is my favorite club In Vegas.  It is absolutely gorgeous, everything about it from even before you enter the club to the bathrooms.  There's an indoor and outdoor section.  By the way, during the warmer months they open up the pool area so you can chill and stick your tired feet in.  Oh and I love their night swims, which is only open on Sunday nights during the summer months, mainly cause I love being in the pool and in my opinion night swim is so much better than day club.  You don't have to worry about dehydration and the sun as much. The only downside is that the water after a while gets kind of murky and you only wonder what's floating around in there. Bathrooms have plenty of stalls so you don't wait as long but sometimes there is a wait.  

Coat check is towards the front entrance and hit up a promoter for guestlist, unless you want to be paying at the door.  Guestlist like goes relatively quickly but I would still suggest not being late.  Talk with your promoter about what time to be there and try to stick to it, yours is not the only party they have to take care of.

Mostly edm music, but sometimes you'll get like lil Jon or will.i.am spinning.  Xs truly gives you the full Vegas experience, complete with pricey drinks.  Sorry, Vegas isn't cheap.",5,2,1

This is my all time favorite club!  The first time we tried getting in we had a group of guys and girls mixed and the line was soooo long that we kept walking and never saw the end of it!  We asked to buy a bottle but it was sold out!  So sadly we ended up leaving and going else where that night.

One year later i went to vegas in a group of girls and got in right away!  it was in June and was jam packed and we didn't get bottle service, but we still had plently of space to sit and dance!  i LOVE LOVE LOVE the music here, and the hot tubs, the pool you can dance in, multiple bars, no lines at any bathroom, black jack table, the list goes on!

This club is so large that the night I was there, paris hilton and jennifer lopez were there also and I never even saw them! I was doing my own thing dancing the night away in the pool with my shoes off it was awesome!  Usually around 3am its time to go home and i am ready to leave but i was sad to leave this place!  

It's also an added bonus to walk through the gorgeous Encore hotel (where i saw regis philban) to get to the club.

XS is reportedly the most expensive nightclub ever built, and it shows.  Take everything that's awesome about the decadent Tryst Nightclub at the Wynn, from decor to music to vibe to awesome bathroom -- then crank it up to 11.  Then you have XS.

Though other clubs try (*cough*BANK*cough*), nobody can match XS for the decadence of its interior -- gold and sparkle everywhere, but especially the fact that it opens up onto a POOL!  (We were there in January, so nobody was jumping in -- wonder if that will happen when I return in June!)

I was there on a Sunday.  The music was pumping.  The drinks were strong and the lines at the bar weren't long at all.  The crowd was definitely good-looking (though you always find a few scary randos at every club).  Best of all, I think the natural layout of curved pathways around tables, which is similar to Tryst's, is what makes the vibe so great.

My friends and I were in Vegas from Saturday to Sunday. We had one night to go out to a club. Based on previous reviews, XS looked the best. We bought tickets for around $40 a person to see Avicii. Since we're from out of town, we have no clue how all the promoters and such worked and were banking on our tickets. The tickets said ""XS Social Encore"" or something was the location. We ended up walking everywhere because the club was actually in the other part of the hotel not listed on our tickets.

Once we're finally in the right building, we're directed half a mile to the ticket line. Waited about a half hour to get in. Maybe the club looked like on the pictures here, but I couldn't tell you because it was so crowded... and this coming from a person who goes to EDM shows like Hard Day of the Dead in LA and is fine in the middle of the front crowd. 

It was too crowded to be fun. We got in the middle and couldn't move or breathe. What's the point if you can't dance? That's the whole reason I'm there. We moved to the back and it was just as bad. We got yelled at by the bouncers for standing in one of the few open spaces.

Even if I was drunk, that would have been AWFUL. It took 15 mins to get from one side of the club to the other. We also wrestled our way to the bar and got some long islands for $18. I'm okay with the price at a venue like this, but my drink was not strong at all (says a lot coming from a 130 pd woman). 

At about 2 a.m. Avicii had still not been on and we couldn't take it anymore. We found some weird side exit (the only one we could get to with the crowd) and walked back to the Mirage feeling extremely disappointed. If they had capped their admission, it would have been fun.

Perhaps I chose the wrong evening to visit, but apparently, there was some ""superstar DJ"" on stage named ""Norman Doray,"" so I was expecting something great. I kept waiting all night for him to put on something cool, but it was nothing but set after set of just banging and noise.

And believe me when I say that I wasn't the only one who felt this way. Out of the hundreds of visitors in attendance, I'd say that less than 10% were even attempting to dance. Now, as a former DJ myself, I can appreciate talent on the turntables, and as far as actual skill, this guy has definitely got it goin' on, but the genre he chooses to waste his talent on is a crying shame. But hey, I'm sure he's making his bread, so who am I to criticize?

On one of our taxi rides around town, we struck up a conversation with a younger, more hip cabbie, and asked him about this troubling techno trend in Vegas these days. He himself said that he abhors it, and wishes they would play more normal music that can be enjoyed by the general populace, and not just a select few.

With all that said, the outdoor portion of XS is quite wide and roomy, and not once did I feel like a piece of wood on the sanding machine like at most other clubs. Aesthetically, it is indeed a beautiful venue. Best of all, there are plenty of ledges to sit on, which was perfect for us, as not a single one in our group of 20+ (mostly from the Bay, and some from Japan) could get down to the horrid beats emanating from the sound system. What's worse for me was the fact that I don't drink, and I couldn't even drown my sorrows in the bottle or cup.

No lie, I was this close to actually giving alcohol a try for the first time in my life just so I could relieve myself from the noise.

Furthermore, If there is one demographic in clubs that I can't stand, it's obnoxious, yuppie aZns, and this place has them in droves. Hey, everyone knows that Asian peeps tend to gravitate towards whatever is perceived as the hip and happenin' spots, and XS certainly falls under this category. I personally much prefer the non-Asian clubs myself.

Since it was ""Swim Sunday,"" the pool area was open for those brave enough to take a dip, and a couple of members of our crew actually decided to take them up on this offer... with their clothes still on! However, since my head was on the verge of bursting like a pumpkin at the musket range, I was long gone by then.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an appointment shortly with my audiologist to get fitted for a new hearing aid.

P.S. There is actually ONE genre of techno that I do like, and love to dance to, which is Jumpen, aka Hardstyle. Unfortunately, none of that was anywhere to be found on this night.",23,25,22

We found some guys that bought us some drinks. while they were at the bar, we found some other guys to dance with that were super cute.

Total BS. Zack the manager did nothing but repeat what Terrence from the nightclub security had said even though he had the rationale of a 10 year old in his argument. I will never show my face at XS again. Why even have a chain of command if nobody does anything to help except repeat what the guy below them said.

I went with my friends two days ago to XS nightclub because we heard a lot of good things about it. I personally stayed in Wynn before. Have been to their casino, shows, buffet and stuff. I had to say I had a great experience staying in Wynn. However, XS nightclub changed my whole viewpoint of Wynn. Let me explain my situation. My friends and I, a group of five people, went to XS around 11 PM. Four of us got in but one of our friends got detained. We thought the security was just double checking his ID so we told the hosts that one of our friends was still outside so we have to wait for him. Then they asked us to stay on the side. Several minutes later, we were still waiting because my friend still couldn't get in. Then one of the security guys said ""you guys have to either go in or GET OUT. We don't have all day for you."" We were so pissed that he was so rude but we didn't say anything. We just left to check what's going on with my friend outside.

We went out and asked my friend what's going on. He told us that the securities said his ID was fake and they took his ID. We asked them why they thought his ID was fake. He said that because the bar code was not consistent and he is 100% sure it's fake. Later we found out that they just caught an Asian who used fake ID and we happened to be a group of asians. The guy said if we want to prove the ID was real we had to cal the cops. We know that if we used fake ID and called the cops. We will be sent to jails. However, we were 100% sure the ID was real because it was the school itself that took my friend to get that state ID. So we called the cops. 15 mins later, cops came. They asked us some questions. One of them was they thought the ID was fake because three of us are using California ID but my friend was using Ohio ID. We told the cops that none of guys went to same colleges. We were all from the same high school that's how we knew each other. And one of our friends was using Michigan ID too. My friend with Ohio ID explained how he got the state ID and also his student ID to prove his identity. We also raised the issue of racism and discrimination because the ways that treated us. Just because they just caught an Asian who used fake ID didn't mean every Asian should be looked differently. The way that they treated us showed that they had no respect to us when they had no proof of us doing any wrong. All they said was the ID was fake and they won't be willing to give it back. 

Cops communicated with them and then came to us saying the ID wasn't fake but we weren't allowed to go in. It's their private property so they could ask us to leave without giving any reasons. We told the cops we weren't planning to get in anyway after all those shits happened and the way they treated us seemed like they were wearing color glasses. We just wanted to prove the ID was real and also an apology from how they thought the ID was fake without proof and how they handled the situation. The whole time the cops were here. None of them said anything, communicated or apologized to us. They used the cops as their mediators. The cops asks suggested us to go to the other nightclubs but we were like nah..they ruined our night. We didn't have the mood to go clubbing anymore. Then the club even sent someone to walk us out of Wynn, treating us like we did something wrong LOL 

I will never stay in Wynn anymore. Neither will I go to their casino, buffet, shows, or clubs. I won't recommend any of my friends to go there either. There are so many other good options in the Strip. I just feel so disgusting how they hired so disrespectful and arrogant securities to work in such high scale place. The securities working in XS nightclub totally changed my positive view of Wynn and if they don't do some management to solve this, they will just keep losing customers. Why would I spend my money here?",16,2,1

Saturday, August, 23rd, I was in town with a group of 7 people to celebrate a 30th birthday. Through our hotel concierge we were put on the guest list for the night and received a confirmation email from one of the VIP hosts, Joe Leano saying that we would receive a line pass when we arrived as long as we contacted him. When we arrived, I contacted Joe and met up with him as instructed. No line pass.  We were then put in the general admission line after being bounced around and very rudely harassed by another one of the doormen. Had I known that being promised a line pass - in writing - meant nothing, I would have made alternative arrangements for my friends birthday. 

In the future, I would hope they would just be honest with people that they needed to reserve a table for bottle service or would be in gen pop.

Once on Saturday 22nd August and then the following Friday - both times to see Zedd! Both nights we had a phenomenal time, we went through a VIP liaison I found on Instagram who books tables (even though we didn't book a table) so we didn't have to pay entry, had full access to the inside and out side without paying additional, and had a complimentary table given to my friend and I. If you can go through a VIP liaison (only if your party is all girls) then do, because these guys hold more authority than promoters do so you get more 'perks' overall. This wasn't my first trip to Vegas nor to XS so I knew what to expect from the nightclub. Classy, good layout, always pleasant security\/bouncers.

When I go to Vegas (usually Friday - Sunday), we go clubbing both nights we're there and XS is a definite must for us to go to.  Plus, you know this place is bomb when the line goes all the way to the end of the hotel and never seems to be moving.

Located in the beautiful Encore Hotel on the Strip, it's simple enough to find once you get in.  There will be signs up ahead and there's always a hotel employee to ask so it's not hard to find.  Typically, there's a guest list you can get on so it's not expensive, but there's NO guest list for Friday or Saturday nights.  Girls typically get in for free before around midnight, but sorry, guys, it's gonna cost you $30-50.  Sucks having a penis in Vegas.  The number of girls in your group will help with how much the guys will pay. Dress code for guys can be strict; guys, dress to impress - no dirty sneaks or looking sloppy.  You won't get in, or any other club for that matter, looking like a slob.  Just sayin'.  My friends and I usually get in line at around 930, just so we can get our stamps and then leave to go pre-game at other nearby lounges or in our rooms and come back at around midnight when it starts to get crackin'.  If you get in line at like 11, expect to wait a longgg time.  I've seen the line get rediculously long, so yea.

Once you get past security and what not, you walk in through this gold revolving door (which is heavier than it looks - I know because I've walked right into it before because I didn't push hard enough).  You then walk up some stairs and you find yourself looking at the club and it's amazing.  Lights, tables, booths and the dance floor are what you see right when you walk in.  Towards the right of the entrance, you'll see a bar.  Near that bar is the entrance towards the pool\/out door area.  The outside is amazing and my favorite thing in the summertime.  There are cabanas, small tables, a small casino area and the outdoor bar.  The cabanas are really roomy and comfortable.  The dance floor inside can get really crowded as in everyone is just rubbing against each other dancing and trying to walk around - especially near the entrance to get outside.  Lots of rubbernecking I guess, so dancing outside is my favorite thing to do.  The pool has a sort of shallow end, where people are allowed to dance in, but don't try and jump into the pool because you WILL get kicked out.  Just stick to the shallow end, which will reach mid calf I guess and dance your hearts out.  The music is pretty awesome.  A lot of house, and top 40 remixes.  You'll be dancing nonstop.  Well drinks are about $15 on average, but not surprising since it is Vegas.  Service at the bars is pretty good, seeing as how it's always packed.  You don't have to wait that long - ladies, with the right dress and sincere smile, a lot of the guys are definitely willing to let you go before them.  Haha, just sayin'.  Doesn't hurt to have boobs in Vegas.  The atmosphere at this place is pretty chill and somewhat diverse I guess - the crowd's ages run from mid 20s to 30s.  You'll definitely run into people you know (the best friend and I have had our run-ins with people we wanted to avoid here - ""You're here? Damn, I thought I left you behind in Orange County.""  Haha).  The people are really nice I guess - mostly because everyone's drunk and just trying to have a good time.  I've only encountered one incident where I had to break a fight between a friend of a friend and a stranger.

Summertime is the best time to go to XS.  They have the pool and outdoor area open.  I went with the best friend Katie N. and Rian A. for my birthday in December, and they closed the outside bar and roped a lot of the area outside so once it got crowded inside, it was pretty much suffocating and claustrophobic almost.  If you're planning a weekend Vegas trip, DEFINITELY put XS on the top of your ""Clubs to Visit"" list.  You will not regret it.",5,3,4

The one thing I had a problem with this club is the CREEPERS! At least make eye contact or something first if you wanna dance up on me... don't slink over slowly with your friends and surround my group of friends while slowly CREEPING in. This has happened almost every time I go to XS, but I can't blame XS for the creepers...

The girls here at the club are very, very beautiful, so this is THE spot for males wanting some eye candy to look at... for the females, not so much. =[

FYI, this review is for the nightclub ONLY:

1. Line isn't that bad.  When compared to the ridiculousness of Marquee, XS is a BREEZE. BUT that's not to say that you shouldn't get there at a reasonable time. Not too many bouncers acting like they're the top of the line and no massive amounts of back lines, front lines, and lines that get all mixed up that you have no idea which line you're in.

2. Ratio is awesome. Again, there's an even ratio of guys to girls ... but this is a top notch Vegas club - can't expect anything less.

3. NO. STAIRS. Awesome, no?

4. It. is. freaking. huge. Thus, this RARELY gets crowded to point where you're smelling other people's B.O or getting splashed with someone's sweat. The outside is HUGE as is the table service inside, plus there are cabanas in higher levels by the pool (my secret place to just stand and watch over the crowd without dealing with the crowd itself)

5. Awesome diverse crowd with awesome DJs.

I used to be an avid Marquee go-er until the rest of the world found out about Marquee and its lavish style and famous DJ residencies.  But, XS is my new favorite, along with all my friends. Why? Because it's HUGE, plays good music, and we've never left the club unhappy.

LINE: Really frackin' long and girls, girls, girls for miles but it does move fast. 

COVER: $20 for girls on most nights but my gal pals who got there right around 10 pm slipped in for free. Con? No one else in the club yet but probably worth saving 20 bucks. Guys are about $30 though, no matter what, sorry!! 

SERVICE: I have no idea, I didn't touch a single drink while I was there. Blasphemy right? The bouncers were pretty no-nonsense though and they didn't seem fazed by all the done-up ladies waiting in line. You really do need to have solid connections to skip everyone and breeze in. 

SCENE: Gorgeous. There are booths aplenty (but you best be coughing up bottle service) and the dance floor spills out right outside. There are even private little roped off areas right in between the glimmering pools and the dance floor. It's probably pretty fun if you have the areas to you and your crew but it's a bit annoying for everyone else to have to step around to get anywhere indoors and out. 

MUSIC: Better than your average club but nothing that blew my dancing shoes off. 

TIP: Don't wear a pink fuzzy birthday crown paired with a lacy white dress and expect people to realize it's your birthday.

Beautiful decor and dancers scattered everywhere, it's a lot to take in, especially when the interior areas are jam packed.

The one thing that makes me ADORE this place is the pool.  On a hot night, already fueled by alcohol, the outdoor area is the oasis to my burning desire to escape the sardines crammed inside.  Once situated at a cabana\/seating area, we were served drinks from a wandering waitress and I was able to kick off my heels and become one with the water.

We avoided going to TAO [which I have yet to go to] because of the over hyped crowd, but the amount of people here scared me straight from going, so maybe next time if I am drunk enough, I'll go to compare.

Sunday nights are pool party nights so bring your swimsuit. The place is huge so you have plenty of places to hang out and there are even spots to sit down. I like that it was busy but not overly crowded.

I remember the very first time I came here. Walking through those swiveling doors it  felt like I just entered another world. Whoever designed this place is a brilliant person.

Beautiful venue, beautiful people and atrociously slow drink service but oh well. But my only beef with this place is if I pay 16 bucks for a drink then I want to get it with a quickness! Having to wait for 30+ minutes is ridiculous. A lot of times me and my friends would just get a hand stamp, step outside and gamble and get free drinks and then step back in. Its usually much faster and less frustrating this way.

I don't like the inside much minus the ceiling fans that look like theyre gently swaying, but the outside of the venue will literally take your breath away. Beautiful architecture, foliage, an expansive pool and beautiful glass railing around it. LOOVVEE! If you dont fall in love in Vegas then youll surely fall in love with the venue",6,1,3

We had purchased our tickets 2 months prior and when we showed up to the event at 10, we still had to wait at least 1.5 hours. While in line, the bouncers were looking to see who was getting desperate to get inside already, and they would approach those individuals and tell them ""if you give me 50 dollars or more I'll let u in right now."" Thats after us ticket holders had already paid full price for the event!!! After more waiting, and no one else was coughing up money to ""grease the wheels"" so to speak, then the bouncers would let in a few people, then close the line again and wait to see who else they can get to cough up more money to get in. The couple in front of us started to get irritated by such blatant robbery by the unprofessional bouncers. So once the bouncer asking for cash saw us talking to the couple in front of us about what was going on, the bouncer was quick to let the four of us in. Once inside, the place was practically empty.  So my girl and I bought drinks and set up near some sofas to party and enjoy the show. Well it started raining outside then people from the pool are started to come into the building and that's when the bouncers also decided to let everyone finally in all at once. So my girl and I were allowed to sit on the sofas and party on the surrounding area, we were joined by a group of people who were also celebrating their friend's bday and we were also joined by that couple that were in front of us, it was the start of a great time with great down to earth people to party with. Well that was very much ruined by a mexican bouncer with a backwards cap who wore an XS employee shirt who came up to me and said ""get out of there coz these people paid alot of f**king money"". This was the first time I encountered one of their employees and had no forewarning that we could not be on the sofa areas. There were absolutely no signs that stated those areas were reseved. Well that was the first foul languaged unprofessional employee I dealt with  for the night. The second unprofessional rude and harassing encounter was when we moved more towards the back of the club alongside a rail where there were alot of people leaning on. My girl and I met up with some friends there. All of a sudden, this large overweight african american bouncer yanks away this balloon animal my girl was holding from her hands and tells us all to move out of the way, then he throws the balloon back at us. We had done nothing wrong to deserve such foul treatment and let alone be harassed by their unprofessional and uneducated bouncers. We ended up leaving soon after and we spoke to one of the security supervisors by the name of Bob and told him about our ordeal. He then referred us to the manager of the XS staff by the name of Cory. We told him about what had happened and said it was not going to be easy to resolve the issue for some odd reason. 
Encore hotel needs to better screen their employees instead of hiring random guys off the street. These foul mouthed unprofessional bouncers need to be held accountable for harassing customers for absolutely no reason and ""shaking-down"" customers to try to get more money out of them.  1 star is for the artist which was great but needs to stop playing there. XS in Las Vegas needs a major overhaul in customer service. Until then, I highly do not recommend this venue to anyone at all. And if you buy your tickets in advance, don't bother, because random people will show up, pay the entry fee and slip right past you while you wait 1.5 hours to get in and be treated like cattle.",1,0,0

Went here for a Friday night escapade. Rocked a cabana and was taken care of by this lovely young lady who was so gracious with the booze.

XS is sexy! I can't think of anyplace else here I could like more than XS! Large dance floor, wide open outdoor\/open air area to chill and cool down after getting your boogie on.

Like any other Vegas nightclub, XS drinks are pricey. I can't complain about dropping $11 on a craft cocktail at Tavern Law when a bloody Redbull-Vodka (Sky Vodka at that) is like $15 dollars... Yeah, it's Vegas. 

The vibe is sexy, make sure you come correct when you step into here... No baggy tshirts and tennis shoes. Gotta look like you belong here. It's all about image. 

The DJ was a resident but his cuts were choice and the dancing was on point. Overall... The fun was in excessive... But hey, that's the best kinda fun right?

I would hate skipping the best club in Vegas due to the fact of not enjoying the music being played. I mean I like mash ups, dance, etc  music too but it was like overkill after a while.

I went with a large group of friends for my boyfriend's birthday. They hate clubs and much prefer to talk, drink and lounge in a place where they can be comfy. Nevertheless, I convinced them that this could be cool.

We booked with a VIP service that got us in in 5 mins. It made the experience SO much better because we didn't have to stress whether and when we'd get in... especially useful when you're with boys. For girls, everything seems easy and free in Vegas!

As you enter, you first see the main dance floor which was packed like sardines. We were worried this would mean the usual bumping and getting kicked around. We made our way through the dance floor and into center of the club where there is a pool, cabanas around the pool... and oooh.. a hot tub!! We were a little cold so the hot tub was a welcome respite. We sunk our legs in and torso-danced to the good music for part of the night. 

The hosts are very picky. One of our friends slipped and fell in the hottub! She also cut herself so she was escorted to the cab to go home and dry-off. We tried to convince them that this was a mistake and to let her stay but they refused! Fortunately, we were staying not too far from Encore, so she was able to change and return and our VIP host got her back in again, easy! We also saw a gaggle of girls and guys have a back and forth and the hosts threw them all out! Try to create as little mischief as possible when you're in there. 

Also, their drink service is really slow but they have wait staff that go around the club and bring you jello-shots. If all you care about is getting sloshed, then this is a good way to go!

They also have gambling tables (I only saw blackjack tables) in the island area in the middle of the pool... their min bets are $50 tho but if you're into gambling, there isn't another better place.

Usually we would aim to get to XS before 9PM to get handstamped to avoid the ridiculous long line & to possibly pay no cover.

I couldn't understand the pattern of their playlist.  It started out with mainstream music, trance, then some hip-hop.  Sometimes the stripper pole can be quite entertaining.  We were watching a girl constantly try to climb to the top only to keep sliding down midway.

The fact that XS is operating where it is, I would hope their management would have the common sense to hire employees who are more sensitive to other cultures. No matter how great the actual venue is, no matter how great their DJs or their music, or even the number of highly attractive ladies that might frequent there, the fact that their first impression at the door is one of unwelcoming racists remark is one that should only deserve criticism, and boycott.

Went to the Skrillex show last weekend, staying at the hotel we had access to the hotel entry line.  It was an easy-to-follow process and easy to get in.  Once you're in, stay.  If you leave, there's a good chance you won't get back in!  To say it was crowded was an understatement, it was a complete safety hazard!! If you were to fall down on the floor, there's a good chance you'd be trampled.  The music was awesome, but after things get going, it's hard to get any kind of service.  $20.00 drinks at a bar that is 5 people deep means you aren't likely to get a drink either.  If you open a tab, your credit card will be held at one of the bars, and you're then required to only access that 1 bar.  Yes, the club is making money hand over fist, but it's unfortunate it takes away from any kind of customer service.

Unfortunate the star DJ doesn't show up until 1:30 AM, especially when the hotel line requires you to be in the club by 11P.  Unless you spend $4,000 to $10,000 (no joke) for inside table service, there is nowhere for you to sit.  Even after 4-5 hours of dancing, everyone needs a break and somewhere to park it for a few moments.

I was always worried about having to pay a premium trying to get into XS, so I think I got lucky on a Sunday night and managed to get in for $30 with a very short line.

When I walked in, I was amazed at how big this place was, seemed smaller from the pictures I saw on their website.  But the best part about this place was definitely the pool area outside, where I spent most of my time lounging with my friends.

Next time I come here, I'm not ordering any drinks unless I'm having a friend get one for me.  The bar near the pool area was swamped and it took me almost 20 mins to wait at the bar and finally get my drink.  Time is short when you come in at midnight.  

If there's one thing that did annoy me about XS, it was the music.  Sure I didn't mind them playing house and dance music, but when the beat stays constant for almost 2 hours, it can get to be a little boring.

Since I haven't gone to any other clubs in Vegas, I can't really make any comparisons.  But XS has created a new standard for me which I'm not sure can be topped right now.  Not bad for my first clubbing experience in Vegas.  Here's hoping for more!  4 stars!",3,2,3

The music's always banging.  Top 40 with a splash of electro and house.

Drinks are overpriced.... But that's Vegas for you. 

they also have a gambling table inside the club... well, its located outside by the pool area.

Like many have said before me, the club itself is pretty amazing (imagine 100 million dollars worth of lights and glitz.). Upon initial entry - huge space with gorgeous lights coming from every direction and beautiful people everywhere; a bit sensory overload if you ask me.  The club features a huge indoor space with multiple bars, dance stages and lots of VIP tables. But no worries, even if you're not doing table service, there are still plenty of place to rest (mostly outdoors, during non-holiday weekends). The restrooms are clean and for some strange reason, no matter how packed the venue is, there's never a line at the ladies room (no complaints there!).  The lady working the restroom is super nice so tip her well.  The outdoor area has a gorgeous pool, gaming tables, multiple bars and upstairs private Cabanas.  

The Music at XS is a hit or miss for me because I'm not in love with Electro all the time but I've always enjoyed the live sets on holiday weekends; We went this past Labor Day weekend and had a great time to Will.I.AM & Manufactured Superstar sets. The only downside is it does get insanely packed and can be difficult to move around and I often wish I had shoe protectors (Manolos and spilled alcohol don't mix!). 

One thing I would like to say is that I see a lot of previous reviews complaining about the long waits and packed bars. Please take note we're talking about one of the best club in Vegas and possibly one of the best clubs in the world; long waiting time should be more than expected.

After calling the Encore 2 weeks in advance of the big weekend, we were told that there were no tables available for advance purchase.

Zack takes customer service to a whole new level.  He sent me a text early in the day to welcome us to Vegas and confirm that we arrived.

CONs: These are factors that kept me from giving it 5 stars. The bouncer that is manning the exit is a complete douchebag.

I politely asked which line to get into when we come back & he rudely said he doesn't know. My sister asked him, too, & he said ""like I told your friend, I don't know."" How can you be an effen bouncer and not know?! Another clubber asked & the douchebag pointed at a sign and said ""Can't you read?"" You don't have to be a douche about it. That was most of the con.

When I was outside in the patio area, a bouncer decided to kick me and a friend out.  I had no idea as to WHY, as there were a ton of other people way more intoxicated than us. I asked the bouncer why we had to leave and he ignored me and told us to follow him leading us to the back gate. While walking I asked again why we had to leave, and what we were doing wrong. Again ignoring me I decided to ask again. He finally said to me 

""LISTEN LADY, YOU NEED TO STOP TALKING AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE"". 

I was stunned at his response as I have NEVER had anyone talk to me like that, yet alone use profanity at me like that.  I then asked what his name was and he said ""no"". I told him I have never had anyone treat me like this and that I believe I have the right to know who he is. He kept ignoring me and shaking his head showing that he was extremely pissed off than started guiding me to another bouncer. This bouncer was a lot more polite and sympathetic to me seeing how upset I was. When I asked the new bouncer what the previous guys name was he also refused to tell me his name. 

When I got back outside the club an hour later, I asked a different worker, James where I have to wait in line for re-entry if I already have a stamp. He pointed to a very long line, the one I initially stood at to first get in. Just to be clear I told him, ""wait I already have a stamp though, do I still have to wait in that long line?"" He then said ""I am not going to get repetitive on you"". 

I am seriously shocked at how rude all the workers here are. They seriously go on some power trips and think they can treat anyone, anyway they want. Being a female I was extremely insulted at the way XS handles their customers.

I asked a different worker at Encore if it was wrong of the bouncer to refuse to give me his name and he said ""yeah, he probably knew he was doing something wrong, if he wouldn't give you his name"". These workers think they can do whatever they want and get away with it.

Lucky for us we got in with bottle service for a measly $1200. 7 guys was going to be impossible and the regular line to get in was enormous. 

So the night started off really nice. We got in and got to our small vip section outdoors. We only had two bottles and that was enough for our group. We started drinking and walked around. There was a lot of people here to fill up the place. With a max of 8000 people and charging anywhere from $30-$50 a head. That can be about $40k each night on entrance alone. 

So it started off right. We were complaining but it got better as the night progressed just by being here and being in vegas. We walked to the dance floor and walked around to check out the scene. I was having fun with the guys. The dj was ok. He played some good music hear and there. 

Until, I went to the bathroom. The bathroom was nice and it started to get packed as the night progressed. I can understand that. It was the part when I left the bathroom that went all downhill.

Last night me and my girlfriend went to see Zedd.  The couple we were going with were on the promoter's list, so entry was free.  They definitely like women in this place because they kept yelling for all the ladies to move to the front of the line and all the men to move to the back.  With an even ratio, they were fine letting us go on and the line moved quickly.  They also handed the women a free drink card.

If this was it, I'd say this place was awesome.  But once we got in, the club interior was packed, and there was no seating outside, except for bottle service.  When my girlfriend got drinks, I asked her to snag us 4 waters.  $40 later, we had 2 pints of water.  That killed the experience.  I figure there was no cover and they did give the ladies drink cards, so there was plenty of value, but it was a disappointing surprise.",2,0,0

It's big, it's bright, it's sexy. 
Dress to impress.

Girls, buy fast flats to fold into your purse. TRUST ME it's worth it after a whole night of dancing in stilettos.

My best friend and I were here last weekend and we had an amazing night. The DJ was good, the atmosphere was amazing, and the people were so nice! The only disappointing things were probably the seating areas ( or lack of) and the other half of the club being non accessible. I had just gotten back from Europe and was use to there being more seating areas that didn't require you to get table services, however we were able to meet many wonderful people who were willing to share their table with us. So note to those who get blisters easily, make your own seating. 
While on the topic of the other half of the club, XS was know to have a beautiful pool area that made up the other half of the club.  However, silly me forgot that it was winter and therefore they had closed it down till spring\/summer.

And when there are people jumping into it with their clothes\/dresses on, that is even better! Let me just say this club is huge. Compared to Marquee and all the other clubs I've been to so far (Hakkasan, Light, Tao, Tryst), this has to be my favorite so far. 

They have enough room indoor and outdoor so that you don't feel to cramped up like how it is at other clubs. And what do you know, Lil' John plays EDM. That's pretty funny in my opinion, although he doesn't transition the songs that well.

The music was good and there were speakers all around the cabanas as well as the dance floor.  

My only complaint is that it was SUPER hot that night and the cabanas don't have A\/C inside, only a fan.  We asked if we could turn on the misters but they said that it gets slippery with the water and girls can fall in their heels.  Not sure why they have misters in that case, but whatever.

I shouldn't be pissed off before I even get into the club and after dropping $30.00 to go down one and a half blocks to get here, now I have to deal with this and you want me to pay to get into this club?! WRONG! 

Also, make sure you drink up or find a guy with bottle service because they do not carry cheap liquor here. Three shots came out to $76 dollars not to mention the 20 some dollar vodka\/cran. On top of that, the bartenders spend too much time gossiping and not enough time making drinks. There's a sea of people fighting to get their attention and they're either walking in the other direction or chatting it up with the girl next to them. I guess they like to waste money.

The crowd is for the most part good looking, but not very diverse. If you like the Asian persuasion, then you'll love XS. The music's wack and the mash-ups get old and bring your buzz down real quick!

I can't knock the overall aesthetics because it does make you say ""Woooooowwww "" like Flava Flav, but dealing with rude staff outside, and the slow bartenders inside is enough for me to choose another clubbing destination. There's always a better time to be found somewhere along the strip.

The customer is always right! Unemployment is at an all time high ( I know this because I saw it on the local news while I was out there), so don't be so angry and out to ruin everyones good time doormen\/women of the strip because pretty soon, you'll be hassling people to slow down and stop to talk to you because you're selling those comp passes for tip money in the hot sun.",0,0,0

We had a table reserved for this past Friday night and were definitely looking forward to it.  But then they called at 10 pm and said they had overbooked their VIP tables, and that we were probably going to get bumped.  We got over to Encore quickly (by 11 pm) and luckily got our table with no extra money or problems.  We were literally in line for just 5 minutes.

My guess is they do get extra grease money from desperate people who have tables but get there late.  So I would get there early even if you do have a table reservation.

Our table was one of the cabanas by the pool.  It was huge and could easily fit a big group of people.  There were 9 of us and we we had 3 bottles- total with tip came out to $2,250.  I'm happy we had a table outside as the ones inside were small and mobbed with people.  We quickly made friends with the neighboring groups and had a big party going in our area.

The place overall is awesome.  Definitely a gorgeous setup and a sight you have to see.  I had table service at Pure last time I went to Vegas, and XS blows that place away.  If you're deciding between XS and Pure, it's an easy decision.

My only complaint was the dance floor was too packed and it was very hard to move around.  But can't fault a place for being too popular, so 5 stars from me.",1,1,1

Was on the 210 going to 15 when my friend called me asking where I was. It was around 5 when she called. She wanted to go to XS that same night we were all arriving.

Luckily, there was NO traffic, driving 80-90 miles, we got to Vegas at 9:30 and Encore around 9:45. Hustled in the car to change (nightmare).

Got stamped and then left to have dinner with my friends. Girls were 20 and guys were 30. It was a friday. I dont know if prices change after 10 or 11.

This was the best way to end a weekend in Vegas! We bought tickets for Sunday Night Swim featuring Lil Jon beforehand ($20), and wore our swimsuits and glow necklaces to the club. We got to XS around 12am and saw a long line to get in.  We were a bit pissed since we already had tickets. Thankfully, we got to the front in 15 minutes and realized the General Admission line intertwined with the ticket holders. The indoor portion of XS was closed off, except for a bar. People were dressed in both swim and club attire. A whole lot of blow up animals and beach balls were everywhere in the pool. Lil Jon came on at 1am, and entertained the crowd. He played a good mix of house, hip hop\/rap, and a few of his older hits. With all the light effects and water splashing when the bass dropped, we felt like we were in a music video the entire night.


**TIPS**

-Make sure to be covered up before you head to the Encore. My sister's swim bottoms were showing and a security guard told her she needed to cover up because they didn't want her walking around like that in the casino. 

-There is a bag check inside for $10. They put your items in a drawstring backpack (which you can take home after). We were able to grab some items in the middle of partying the night away as well.

One tip:  guys should buy their tickets ahead of time online.  Our guy did this, with the group of 5 girls, and they let him right in with us.  AND, get there early, like around 10pm.

I went to watch Avicii. He might as well have put on his CD because there wasn't a hint of a remix, or any effort.

One price for men, another for women. One set of rules for men, another for women. 

Packed full of rich shallow males and air-headed, gold-digging and equally shallow women. 

'VIP' seating areas are absolutely everywhere and, therefore, impossible to avoid so if you don't have one you spend the entire night being moved on by security.

As part of a bachelorette party we decided to check out XS, after being completely disappointed by Tryst, on a Saturday.   I was with 7 girls as part of a bachelorette party.  After leaving Tryst, we specifically asked an employee outside of the Tryst if we needed another stamp for XS (in addition to the two we already had). He told us no and that we would be fine. So we took the walk in our heels all the way to XS, only to be told by a rude male at the front of the line that we needed another stamp. Despite explaining that we were told we did not, and that it was my sisters bachelorette party, the male replied ""that's nice."" When we asked for his supervisor, he advised that he did not have a manager. Realizing that we weren't going to get any help from this person, other than attitude, we decided to walk all the way back to XS. We ran into a male named Adam on the way. We explained the situation to him, and he replied ""I don't care."" I could not believe how rude and unhelpful these employees could be. Nonetheless, we made the walk to Tryst and got stamped by a surprisingly friendly male. By the time we got into XS, we had at least 5 stamps on our hands. It seemed like every employee we passed had to stamp us. 

Overall, the ""customer service"" experienced was appalling, and the place smells like feet. I recommend others to choose another location to celebrate their bachelorette party, or occasion!",0,0,0

Music is some of the worst, most boring, and un-vegas-like I have experienced. Maybe you are just supposed to stand around, drink, look pretty and hit on each other under their bright lighting, but this music is definitely not danceable unless you are very intoxicated.. maybe this is intentional to get guests to order more drinks. ugh.  

On a spring\/early summer\/fall night when its not over 100degrees out this is a great spot to go early, relax, enjoy being out by the pool and the outdoor tables.. but every time I've gone I've left within 20-30minutes of getting on the dance floor... after 3 songs I'm bored out of my mind!!! Warning $50 cover and long line if you're a dude.  

Not only is the music super awkward to try to dance to (ok i can only fist bump a few times before its not fun anymore) they have a lot of lighting which is certainly pretty but can be pretty awkward in a club when your dancing!

I have seen & bumped into several actors\/athletes here so if you want to see pretty people come here..

By far the most opulent club I've ever been to.  Tryst was amazing and this just knocked its socks off.  Inside is a beautifully appointed mega club and outside it feels like you're in Miami at a mansion pool party.  There's even a mini casino in the middle of the pool area for that one guy in the group that has to gamble 24\/7 while in vegas.  Room to dance and mingle and get yourself into a lot of trouble.  Girls in bikinis dancing their horny butts away in the pool until the E wears off.  Drunk groups of people getting crazy.  People making out everywhere.  Vice at its best.

That was when we decided to leave and saw most of our group outside and learned that three other girls got their phones stolen. 

When that many girls get pick-pocketed, you wonder about the kind of people this club lets in and their lack of security. Maybe Omnia is the way to go, somewhere classier and much more high end to filter out these low lives who can't work for a living but steal instead.

Everytime I go to vegas this is my must spot for Saturday night but I hear its great all weekend long, even Mondays!

This place has over 1000 reviews so i'll spare you the redundant details and focus on my tips\/advice if you're a first timer.

If you're doing the general admission\/e-ticket thing the lines arent as bad as they may look. I've waited in line on Saturday night (their busiest night) on regular weekends, holiday weekends, and major boxing weekends (mayweather) and have never had to wait longer than 30 minutes. It moves fairly quickly. Only time I waited longer was memorial weekend but thats just a well known crazy night and well worth the wait no matter how long it took. On any night you better get in line by 11\/11:30'ish or all bets are off, including price of admission which I hear goes up after 12.

On busy night the dancefloor can get completely gridlocked. Even though I like to dance I try to avoid that situation for numerous reasons. There is room to dance up by the main level of tables. Thats where i'll go if its too crazy. A place to dance where you can still enjoy the atmosphere without getting bumped into a million times.

I hear lots of complaints about the bars but its not that bad. They get busy and it can be a bit of a wait but not too bad if you're good at picking your spots. I like to go to the one on the other side of the pool because its the furthest from the club.

Drink prices? Who cares. It's vegas. You shouldn't be in vegas if money is an issue. Thats like going to the Oscars but complaining that you have to wear a tuxedo and take a limo. Please!

Same goes for the dress code (guys). Dress to impress, it's Vegas, not some local watering hole in the middle of nowhere. As with most clubs in vegas dress shoes are a must. I would avoid wearing anything even resembling a tennis shoe, even if its a solid black\/brown color dressy looking tennis shoe. XS has staff that will walk up and down the line and literally kick you out if you are not dressed properly. Dress at your own risk!  

Music, I hear alot of complaints from people like myself who enjoy hip hop\/r&b. Yes the DJ's will bombard you with house\/techno\/EDM but you just have to grin and bear it. Its the hottest club in the world so you just have to tolerate it. Once I start drinking I don't care. i'll even dance to it. I'm buzzed and enjoying myself surrounded by hot girls in a great club, I could care less what they're playing. Haha.

All in all this place is kinda like the playboy mansion, everyone should experience it at least once in their life.

I'm usually there on Saturdays during all the popular weekends so if you run into me don't be afraid to say hi. See you there! Cheers!",4,2,0

I've never gotten into a club that fast before.  It only took 5 minutes to get into the club.  Now, the bar line, thats a whole different story...

Since the last time I came to XS years ago, the music and type of dancing has changed a lot.  Its much more of the EDC crowd so its not much of the traditional ""grinding with a girl"" anymore.  So much more jumping up and down and telling the person next to you how awesome the (insert celebrity DJ) and (insert B-rated celebrity next to him) is.

The venue size-wise is really big and the grand entranceway makes you feel like an A-lister.  And the pool area gives guests a breather from the hot sweaty mess that is inside.  Warning though, the last few times it was cold and windy out there.  On the plus side, there's a bar and some gambling tables in the pool area in order to hang out for a little bit and not fight with the bar line inside.  We got table service outside last time but we probably wouldn't do it again.  All the girls got really cold sitting down in their thin dresses.  The solution was either a boyfriend or more alcohol, both of which was fine for the guys.

NOTE:  If you have paid to see whichever DJ is there make sure you get banded when you enter.  We ended up making our way to the front only to realize we never got the right band for the DJ.  We just paid the door guys and got in instead of dealing with going all the way back to the front of the club to get banded.

Inside the club we found a little area in between two bottle service areas and just made it our own.  We tried getting bottle service but they were looking at $5,000 for a table and that was even with us going through a promoter as well.  We got good and roasted before we went in and didn't really need to drink much once Skrillex went on around 130AM.

There's a huge outdoor area with bar to mingle. There are also cabanas to rent if you want private seating and bottle service. There's an indoor dance floor with pole and go-go dancers. The one thing that I didn't like about the place is that it smelled like dried stale chlorinated carpet. Funky. So much so, it was kinda too gross to hang inside. 

Drink prices are on par for location. Dress to impress, of course. By the time we left the club, a little after midnight, there were hordes (hordes!) of folks trying to get in.

Maybe it was just because Redfoo was performing tonight but omfg, XS needs to work on their crowd control. I mean seriously, I was literally sandwiched between 5 people and I couldn't even lift my arms up.

Granted, the venue is pretty nice compared to the other clubs I've been to in the US and the layout is segmented quite nicely. Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty sure the dance floor is a decent size but the security should definitely make sure that it isn't over capacity. Personally, I would suggest putting a cap on the # of people allowed in the club (rather than the dance floor because people were sneaking in). I understand people trying to make a profit but cmon, if your club is that crowded, you're gonna lose the reputation that you'd much rather have.

Another complaint that I had was that I had to experience ""champagne showers"" first-hand. Trust me, it isn't fun when you're stuck in a sea of sweaty people...

Overall, I really wanted to like this venue, but the control of the # of people is just not there. I mean, the music was good and the venue itself is really nice, but the fact that I couldn't even dance brought my experience to rock bottom. Oh and we waited in line for 30+ minutes even though we were on the guest list. Maybe I'll try it again during summer since I hear that there's an outdoor section.",10,3,1

I've go to Surrender, which is on the same grounds, but this was my first time at XS, and the energy was through the roof both nights! It seems like they always have some good DJs, especially on the weekends. I like the set up with tables circling the dance floor, and the back of the stage going out to the pool area. It made it really easy to go cool off or chat by the pool when we'd get tired of the crowd and want to recharge. The only reason that I knocked a star off was because it is kind of confusing as to where it is. It's not well advertised in the hotel, and I still do not know whether to say that it's at Wynn or Encore.

The first experience was great, but the next time I visited wasn't the same. Both times were Saturday nights. The first time I went with my man and we had an excellent time. However a few months later I went with my girlfriends and we tried to go to this club and the doormen were so difficult we ended up just leaving. Here's what happened.

Me and my girls(6 of us total) and our 1 guy friend were approached earlier in the day by a promoter who said we could get in free to XS if we went to Tryst first to get a hand stamp and some free drinks. Sounded great so we took him up on his offer. 

Tryst was awesome and we all ended up with several free drinks each. Our 1 guy only paid half price cover. Then at about 2am we head over to XS to get in free. 

Here's the tricky part. They set up a separate free entrance on the other side around the corner of the main club entrance. We approached with our hand stamps and he of course lets all of us in except our 1 guy friend. We tell the bouncer nicely that he's our only guy friend and to please not make him go stand in the main line by himself. The doorman was of course on a ego trip and wouldn't budge on this. So to be nice to our friend we went around to the main entrance to stand in line with him. We get up to the front and then get snubbed by that doorman too. Finally he decides to let us through.Our guy friend prepares to pay as we head into the club. Then we get yelled at that we have to pay cover too. We say that we have the hand stamps. They say we can't come thru this line then. Blah,Blah, Blah and so on. Ok, then never mind. We aren't desperate. We just wanted to finish off the evening with a little more dancing. It just wasn't worth all this hassle. So we left.

I will say the club is beautiful and might be worth seeing once if your willing to deal with the hassle of it all, but go early. The later it gets the more irritated the doormen are.",1,0,0

We're tanner, we're more shredded, and we make it rain with the cash flow, goose bottles left and right bro.""

Hahahaha...just wanted to start off my review with something ""Jersey Shore""-ish.

First time me and my friends, we opted for the bottle service.  The bottle service was very nice since it was in the middle of the summer and was hot as hell.  We had a cabanna bed thingamajig with a view of the pool and easy access to the indoor area.  Our bottle service came with our own personal waitress and bouncer.  The waitress, Carolyn (I can't really remember...all I remember was that she was hot) was friendly and did I mention hot.  Our bouncer, Rob watched our bed thingamajig and kicked out whoever we didn't want in our vicinity.  Extra bonus for us was Montell Jordan was there and performed the classic ""This Is How We Do It.""

The second time we went, we didn't get bottle service since there was a minumum of three bottles.  There were only three of us so I didn't think it was a good idea to destroy our livers with a bottle for each of us.  We went in March which is actually pretty cold at night.  We gambled at the tables across the pool.  Oh yeah did I already tell you that the dealer was hot.  The dealer was very nice to us.  She gave us good tips and suggestions since we were highly intoxicated.  

This a place you definitely have to stop by if you are in sin city ( and if you like hot girls)",2,6,2

Service: Got there early, so we didn't have to wait too long. Our guest list sign ups got mixed up though, so the guys still had to pay the $30 cover fee (girls got in for free). I don't know...the place is pretty.

**The security here was very chill with me though. After waiting in line for so long a couple of my friends had to go to the bathroom. The security guy said it was okay, but after they left I asked the guy if he could do me a favor and prank my friends.

-Go-go dancers were workin' it on their stripper poles. Only the cream of the crop here.

-Drinks are on the expensive side, $15 each for my Coronas, but it's Vegas so deal with it. You can always make it up at the casino later on.

-Patio seats with big cushy pillows that move around after you sit awhile on them. Yeah not too cool but the breathtaking view of the pool and surrounding suites of Encore make up for that.

-Music was probably Hip Hop and Top 40 stuff like everyone else has said. Too busy making conversation and meeting people to notice what was playing.

My time was too short there to due to a wonderful group of women I met there and so we dashed off to a different destination. I'll make sure to come back next time and stay up to the wee hours of 4AM.",9,6,8

Let me tell you, once you walk into the club through this entrance you stand at the top of the stairs and you see a see a sea of people dancing on the dance floor and then past them you see the outside lit to perfection. Everything about this club is spot on. 
Surrender used to be my favorite club in Vegas but this takes the cake. It is absolutely stunning. There is enough room inside, a large dance floor, somewhere for people to sit who don't have tables, and just such a great atmosphere. If I could, I would live in one of the cabanas.

Yes, the club looks sleek and posh and the outdoor\/indoor set up is nice. However, $15 for one shot seems a little excessive. And talk about CROWDED. The dance floor was a major CF. I could barely move let alone dance. And I felt like everywhere we were, people were constantly shoving past.

Yes the line moves quickly. Definitely sign up for the guestlist or it's $20 for ladies, $50 for guys. I hear on holidays cover is even more!

Friends who know some locals say this is the place to go, so of course we had to check it out. We (of course) ran into a club promoter on the strip who had told us we would be on a list. We had assumed it was free cover for ladies since the promoter really didn't mention anything about a cover charge. I guess we appeared DUMB when asking why we had to pay $20 after we entered a line that appeared to be like getting on a  roller coaster at Great America. The cashier was like ""No one gets in free here"" (I guess its that cool...) Others paid $50 and we even met some people that paid $80 in advance with a table (even more money) who weren't able to get in. I guess they came too late? WOW--way to steal peoples money.

Let alone, some big shot DJ was hosting....DeadMau5. Not being a regular clubber, I had NO idea who the heck that was but thought it'd be worth it since the club paid him 250k.(Ridiculous!!) I just couldn't get into his music...maybe it was b\/c there was no lyrics?? or it just sounded like EVERY song was the same?? Not even a few drinks would've gotten me to enjoy the music. Too bad I didn't even get a chance to get a drink because there was about a 20 min line outside and I couldnt even enter the inside (too many people). My sister had to use the restroom and 30 min later she came back (yup-- its one of those places).

On a positive note, the decor was amazing and the place is HUGE. It's basically the entire pool area and an area inside that turns into a giant nightclub at night. Smart idea, Steve Wynn....  Maybe some more bars could help though? 

We didn't stay very long, I guess we really just don't appreciate electronic or house or whatever you call it kind of music and that was it for us. Trying to find the EXIT was a joke.

We lucked out and got walked in without paying cover (so it was a good night)!

The DJ was good. Playing all the usual hip hop jams, not the best but still good.

There is plenty of room for all sorts of debauchery. And when your feet hurt from dancing, you can soak them in the huge pool or hot tubs outside! There are also heaters outside (if you worried about being cold).

Security checking IDs\/tickets are always talkative LOL. Every time I come here they always give me a ""hard time"" about my ID saying my picture doesn't look like me, but it's only a passing comment and we laugh about it and they usher me in quickly to check my friends' IDS.. NOTE: I know some security guards can be annoying about this (I.E. take away your card, make you recite your address, ask you 21 questions) but they just comment ""this doesn't look like you"" and I say ""but it is me haha"" and they smile and let me in. They're more talkative than other guards and a lot more friendly. Can't speak for all of them, only for the ones I've encountered. 

Outside venue:

First off, it's beautiful. Yes, a club being beautiful, you heard (read?) me right. The outside of the club looks like some sort of resort with the large pool, the casino area, the bars, and there are actually places to sit! It's nice and clean and bonus, you can hear the music playing from inside of the club BUT I'd rather be inside the club when the DJ comes on. Cause why pay or stand in line to get into a club just to spend all your time listening to the music from speakers right? :P

Inside venue:

Inside is spacious and unlike other clubs it doesn't feel stuffy or crowded. The bathrooms are nice and clean (always a plus) and staff is friendly. I can't tell you how nice it is to be able to stand around in a large group and not get elbowed by people passing through. 

I've always had a good time here and they do books some amazing acts as well. As of right now, Skrillex takes residency here so you know you'll have a good time when he comes on.

My birthday was on a Sunday and I heard from friends, who are Vegas veterans, that XS is the place to be on Sunday nights. 

Both the Wynn and Encore hotels are absolutely gorgeous. Upon walking into the lobby of Encore, I knew that we were in good hands and that we had made the right choice! At the entrance of XS you will notice two lines, one for general admission and the other for guestlist and table service. Dress code is strictly enforced but since it was a Sunday night, when they host their pool parties, guys and girls were dressed a little more casually or in swim suits.

The inside of XS is gorgeous and there is nothing but truth in the 1400 reviews that say so. There are tons of tables and booths, but of course you need to buy bottle service to sit in them or make friends with people who do ;) The outside is beyond beautiful - cabanas, daybeds, and tables scattered around the pool. There is also a gaming area with tons of tables. 

Since it was my birthday we got bottle service and were seated at an table right by the pool - so perfect, we were in the middle of everything!  If you come in a big group and are willing to put down some money and split bottle service, I highly recommend it. Special thanks to Rodrigo and Caroline for taking care of us! 

We happened to come on the last Sunday night pool party of the summer so we knew we were in for a good night! DJ Alesso was spinning that night and the music was so awesome - Top 40 mashed up with house. If your feet are tired from dancing all night, take your shoes off and dance in the pool - so refreshing!

They book pretty good DJs and XS has been my number one favorite club to frequent in Vegas ever since I turned 21. However, the incident that happened last Sunday made me rethink to as whether I want to even come back to XS ever. Again. 

So I arrived at XS and my coworkers wanted to buy two Patron shots. Personally, I don't drink Patron so I just told them to stay put and I'd help them out and buy the shots for them. I went to the bar on the right side from the stage, and was helped by a blonde female bartender with a mole on her upper lip. I attempted to pay with my Visa debit card, but she proceeded to tell me that my card wasn't working. I asked her to perhaps try one more time, and she refused to. She then took my card and signaled for a bouncer to come, escort me to an ATM to withdraw cash, and pay for the shots, despite my continuous efforts to tell her, ""NO I NO LONGER WANT THESE SHOTS"". She informed me that if I didn't withdraw money to pay for the shots that I supposedly ordered, she would've had me kicked out of the nightclub.

I understand why there is so much love for XS. This is the kind of venue you would see in a movie that is showing what Vegas nightlife is like. They have all the right pieces to make a fun experience but it has never been on the top of the list of places for me. I think because I am not into the EDM world and because when I dance I want a place that is comfortable and it is hard to make that happen with the XS setup. 

When you enter XS which has a great Wednesday night option as well as fun weekends there is a very picturesque outside setup. Honestly it's one of the coolest outside seating options I have ever seen. There are several mini pools and then larger ones that VIPs can sit beside and lounge if they want to get away from the main dancefloor. Most of the club is located outside so you are completely at the mercy of the Vegas weather on how much fun you will have in this place. When it is cold they have heat lamps like many other clubs but you can't get over the fact that you are freezing. It's something that Chateau and Pure face as well so you know what you are getting into when you venture into a place like this. Seriously I couldn't get over how great this outside set up was. I am not into outside seating or hanging out and just talking to people. I come to Vegas to dance and no matter how fancy of a setup it is if it's not fun to get down on the dancefloor I lose interest.

Once you are past the seating you get to the main dancefloor which as a bar close to the entrance and on the sides. There is a dancefloor in the middle that spills out into the outside seating area mentioned and people are crammed in trying to stay in the warmth or cold of the inside dancing area depending on the weather. We went in the middle of summer and honestly it was just too fucking hot to enjoy this place. Maybe it changes with more temperate weather but it was just a sweaty and exhausting mess before we even made it to 11pm. 

The DJ inside was okay he played a mix of EDM and scattered rounds of hip hop which we tried to soak in while they lasted. Eventually later in the night Will.I.Am came out with RedFoo and performed a few sets on the DJ setup in the outside seating area. This was a really really weird thing. The area outside if very small to watch so the crowd was watching from inside and outside but there wasn't really a place to dance so it broke out into weird personal dance battles. They were also competing with the DJ still playing inside but the music bled into each other so you couldn't really enjoy either performance. 

Overall the music was average and the setup while great looking wasn't really fun or conducive to dancing. XS is great to look at but once you get to the clubbing part you realize you aren't really having that much fun. I would give the Wednesday night a shot or even if I was going with a date or a group of friends that just wanted to hang out I would make this trip again but overall I feel there are better nights out than XS to be had in Vegas.

PROS:
* chandeliers (no seriously it's so pretty. thank you steve wynn). It's just so... pretty inside. The lighting inside, giant pool, cabanas outside... definitely makes anyone feel more glamorous. 
* large open-air dance floor
* pool that attractive females are allowed to wade in without getting kicked out
* sitting area around the trees and pools outside.
* I like that the music I was exposed to had a good mix of top40 dance tracks. I mean, a girl likes to sing out loud to her radio jams once in a while ;) 
* bouncers at XS are less annoying (see my TAO review for comparison please), probably because there are more people to monitor there. and people can get pretty crazy...
* did I mention sitting areas for the not-so-rich bottle service clubbers? it's such a relief if you're planning on spending the whole night there because...

CONS:
* everyone pays cover, even girls. so you better be spending a good chunk of time there. unless you get a promoter's #. In that case, get as many girls in as possible and split the fees later or something if you have a mixed gender group
* the crowd and general atmosphere varies depending on the night. I've been there when it's kind of not bumpin' and I've had one of my best nights there. so... it's a toss up.
* the crowd. ugh. good that it's so popular, bad for the line waiting and the obnoxiously drunk people, WHO BRING THEIR OVERFLOWING DRINKS TO THE DANCE FLOOR, stepping all over you.

This place was a huge disappointment. I have been to my share of clubs in Vegas and have never seen one operated this ridiculous before. It was an absolute Circus. When you pay for bottle service you're paying for a sort of VIP experience, right? Well it was everything short of that. Even if you didn't pay for bottle service no public place should ever ever under any circumstances treat their guests the way they did here. First off the doorman for the table service line was an absolute tool. First of all you work at a nightclub, you're not the owner of the Wynn, Encore or XS nightclub so lets comes back down to reality real quick honey and remember your salary and what you get paid to do. Really sorry I didn't catch your name. He was unable to open his eyes big enough or too lazy or really up on himself that he was the doorman with some kind of power - not sure what it was?? But anyway we gave him the name of our table 3 times and he kicked us out of line each time after doing some lazy scan of the list and saying ""there's no table on my list for that name, get out of my line!"" - Finally we had a friend inconvenience his party time and go out to the door and grab my group of 5 girls. Once he came out o all of the sudden the name was found on the list? Then he proceeded to say ""you never gave me that name and you can shut your mouth or get out of my club"" - absolutely unacceptable. I manage a customer service sector and I would never ever allow my employees to speak to anyone that way, whether it be a customer or co-worker or some passer-by. Never acceptable. Once we finally get to our table there were randoms who kept coming by trying to bum drinks, really? where's the crowd control - it took my party an hour and half to get to our table because some run around of getting a green stamp to be allowed at table service so really confused as to how these random made it to our table? And don't think your table will be constantly stocked with clean glasses or ice, this guy took forever to come and change out. On top of all of it as we had to push our way through the overcrowding to find our way through the club my friend tripped on the ledge and pool and fell onto a step inside of the pool. Word of advice to whoever is managing this club, you have a lot of work to do beyond your terrible customer service and crowd control. Stop being cheap and pay for some security up and around that pool. The coordinators of this club have proved to have 0 integrity, I've emailed a more detailed description of my night of 7\/26\/14 experience and never heard back. They don't care what kind of experience their customers had or will have, they'll be quick to take your money but don't expect anything from it. Bottom line is my entire party was disappointed by this club and will not be returning, the staff made us feel like very underprivileged customers and it ruined our entire Vegas trip because we could easily taken the money spent on the table to Marquee and been completely satisfied. You never know exactly who you are turning away or disappointing so I'd be careful with your staffs selections if I were managing this club. I'll leave it at that. ;) Good Luck.",1,0,0

The staff was great. The bartenders were friendly, even though the lines were ridiculous. The security guards & bouncer were super friendly; we were joking with them the entire time.  The security wasn't the pushy bossy type and was even helpful in finding us a cab at the end of the night.

Pros:
- Outdoor venue.
- Multiple Bars.
- Multiple pools.
- Great Atmosphere.
- Gambling tables available.

Cons:
- Crowded bar area (Getting a drink here is almost impossible, especially in the main center bar section)
- Small portion drink cups (Drinks being served in courtesy water cups?) 
- Inconsistent with drink prices (Was being charged 5% more by another bartender)
- No crowd control (Takes long periods of time to get around. No one to move people who are blocking walkways)
- No ""Caution - Slippery when wet"" signs (Guests are in and out of pool areas and obviously dripping pool water everywhere)
- Staff not much friendly (Security and Bartenders could be friendlier) 
- Long taxi wait after clubs ends (Approx. time for taxi: 1hour) 

*Summary:
In all seriousness, this is a fun place to be at. They just need to take their business a bit more serious and they'll have 5-stars from me. 
- Make sure you're here in advance so that you have somewhere to hang out. If you're looking to swim, make sure to bring change of clothes just so that you don't mess up your dress clothes and such. This one particular female bartender with blonde short hair made me wait long periods to order drinks and to ask for a lime.

Moved back out towards the lobby multiple times and had a few friends of the party be upset and cry. Not coming here again due to bad service.

Yes its beautiful, tremendously large and certainly a good time. In my opinion the club is overrated, its actually too big and needs a ton of people in order for it to seem busy. It nice being able to freely walk around the space without having people sweat all over you. However because of the size of the space they have to let everyone and there mother in here. The music is terrible, horrible top forty that no one really enjoys.. Well at least anyone from NYC who actually knows what good music is. Personally I like Hip hop and House Music, they played little of each, rather Lady GaGa and Michael Child touching Jackson rang out from speakers. Felt as though I was at some glorified gay bar.. This seems to be the case in most Vegas club unless it Labor\/Memorial Day weekend when somebody who actually knows how to DJ shows up. There were a decent amount of hot chicks here but the majority of the crowd is Asian Invasion mixed with Slum Dog millionaires all congregating in what they thought was the coolest party ever. The bartenders were slow, for a drink I suggest getting a bottle(total waste of money, unless you have a large group) or just hitting the bar in the middle of the pool.

AMBIANCE - 5
When I first walked in I literally stopped to take everything in and could not close my jaw. The dance floor, bars, and outside area are illuminated by a variety of soft neon and natural lights, there are huge statues everywhere, and there is a huge pool in the center that captures everyone's attention. (especially those who are drunk enough to jump in and get kicked out.) They also have beautiful ladies doing things on stages and poles around the dance floor and near the pool which is erm... always fun. 

COVER -4
Men are usually $30 and women are $20, which is decent for an upscale Vegas club. If you buy tickets from random vendors on the strip, you can get in for about $2-3 bucks a person! My friends and I did this, so we had some ""extra money"" left over for drinks.

THE BARS - 4

The bartenders are almost as polite as they are efficient, occasionally smiling during their blitz of drink making. Drinks are expensive but hey, it's Vegas. AMF's are $16 bucks each with shots running a little cheaper. Don't get carried away in all of your fun, it really adds up. (That is why flasks and pre-gaming  were invented!)

THE DANCEFLOOR - 3.5

The music was a little off, probably to cater to the diverse crowd. No matter what you like or dislike, you will be unhappy for some time during the night, as the music is played in strange ""blocks."" They mashed up some weird techno beats for 30 minutes, which we hated, and then transitioned into Nirvana before finally getting into some hip hop club songs for another 30 minutes. The floor itself is CROWDED to the max with energetic patrons mostly in their 20's and early 30's flailing around with the help of some good drinks. Even when the songs are bad, the floor is never clear. Choose a spot and commit, and be sure to have a meeting point, as this club is huuuge and texting on the floor to find your chums is not very effective. 

Overall, I had a great time and ended up going twice. My friends and I will probably go back if we ever return to the City of Sin!",19,15,17

I came to XS and if I loved it before I love it more now. 
Granted there is a lot of ground to cover now and meeting up with people is a bitch. 
I legitimately got lost. I saw some friends at a table outside, and I tried to find them again and I just could not find them.

The pool is gorgeous though! and it has the middle gambling\/ bar area. It gets pretty crowded though. 

And surprisingly when I went, even though it was cold, there were ratchets in the pool in their full on dresses. so..... that is allowed if that's your thing. loll
however guarantee people are judging you.  ALSO! I got splashed by one of these ratchets so... no bueno. me no likey.

I mean this club is seriously so enormous and absolutly off the hook, not to mention it has tons of stripper poles woo hoo!!! With enough booze you'll be a pro. Half the club is inside while the other half is outside. 

Okay so be here early because the lines are long and i mean huge!!! I was tempted to leave when I saw the line, and i got there half an hour before they opened, but it moved pretty fast though. It's 20 dollars for ladies and nope there is no guestlist so unless you know someone then you're paying.  

There are tons of restrooms so hooray you usually don't have to wait long. The drinks are pretty pricey 12 for cocktails and one cost my friend 15 bucks so be prepared to pay tons of money for drinks or just go buzzed. 

So why the 3 stars?! Well it should be a 5, but this club is just so huge that it's pretty impossible to meet and chat with people, or if you see a hottie and look away for one second, boom he's gone and chances are you probably won't be able to find him again.

-No waiting in line at all if you're staying at the Wynn or Encore (yay!)
-Tickets are also discounted and last minute tickets available at the concierge
-The place is beautiful all lit up
-Place to be seen, if you're into that kind of thing
-Crowded, per usual, even though this place is HUGE
-drinks are pricey but that's expected
-beautiful people everywhere!! 
-Expect to be hit on by a few guys who don't care that you have a wedding ring on
-Expect to hear people yelling at you because you cut the line because you're a guest at Encore
-Expect your foot to get stepped on and people to invade your personal bubble even though there's plenty of space! 
-do not bring someone on a first date here, you won't be conversing!

We couldn't find the coat check, so I spent the whole night holding onto my jacket. But, the music was pretty good, but I'm not a huge house music fan, and the space is very nice. 

It is definitely way better than any of the clubs I've been to in NYC. Everyone is super dressed up and everything just seems classier.

I was not that impressed as I was hoping the vibe would be more house\/trance\/progressive.  It is most certainly NOT.  Mashups and pop with r'n'b isn't bad, it just isn't my cup of tea.  What really annoyed me was that they played Gaga's Just Dance at least 3 times in a 2-hour window.  (IMO, that's grounds for dismissing the DJ).

Yes, it's the eye candy that really takes you aback.  Too bad none of this eye candy is really approachable.  I did meet people who were really nice, but there's a fair share of people trying REALLY hard to look too important to talk to you.

Also, the dance floor is way too small for the size of the club.  I don't have anything to say about the price of drinks, since they're on par with everything else in Vegas.

So check that off the list of 'things to do'.  Yes I saw the most expensive nightclub in the world, and yes, it's beautiful and architecturally interesting.

My boyfriend and I bought tickets in advance to make things easier, and anyways people have said that when they get on the list they end up having to pay more once inside. We got to the club pretty early (about 10:30) so we didn't really have to wait at all. It was kind of mellow when we first got in, but it quickly picked up. We danced for a while, got drinks, everything was good. We went in January so the outside with the pools wasn't open, but the inside of the club is really awesome. 

Reason for my 2 stars: my iphone and wallet with my ID and cards got picked out of my purse (I was wearing a small crossbody bag with a zipper). The worst part about this was that I had been checking all night to make sure my phone and wallet were still there, like at least 10 times. I even told my boyfriend that I didn't want to take my phone out of my purse to take a picture because I didn't want to lose it, so I was seriously being super cautious. After Alesso had been playing for a while the dance floor got so extremely crowded that we couldn't even move, so we decided to go. I went to check and make sure that my phone and wallet were still in my purse, and it was unzipped and my stuff was gone. When I went to the front desk kind of area (near the coat check) to make a report, there was another couple there filing a report. The same exact thing had happened to the girl, her phone and wallet were taken right out of her bag. She and I both tried to call our phones and use Find my iphone but went straight to voicemail and in find my iphone the phones were ""offline"". I'm sure we weren't the only ones that night who had our stuff taken, because from other reviews on Yelp and other places online you can see this is kind of a trend at XS. 

Would have been a fun night except for this. I don't know what XS can do to avoid this, but it seems like its a big problem that needs attention. GIRLS - if you come here WEAR A WRISTLET AND KEEP A HOLD OF IT AT ALL TIMES!!! Not just hanging from your wrist, HOLD IT.",1,0,0

Free for guys and girls on guestlist before 12am. The line goes by a lot faster than I would expect. We also got one free complimentary drinks for the girls.

Lockers are only $10 !!!! You can come back and get something from your bag only two extra times for free. After that you would have to take your bag or pay again.

Drinks here are averaged price. Water is expensive for a little bottle, but they also have water fountains as well if you want to be cheap.

I LOVED the inflatable animals and balls flying everywhere in the pool.
But beware, you WILL get hit in the head by a giant ball at least 8942392 times if you stay in the pool the whole night like I did.

Everything was just perfect at night time because you don't got the scorching sun in your face.

While waiting in one unorganized line to get into the dancing part of the club, we were told they were at capacity and then told that ""for a price"" we can get in. One of my BF's brothers friends was fed up waiting and slipped the guy $20 and were right away let through the ropes...hmmmm.  Only then to be literally JAMMED packed, couldn't walk, couldn't dance, couldn't even take a sip of my $20 drink.

This club is huge, and I love the open layout, unlike other clubs which have soo many stairs to climb up and down. We came for Avicii, all the girls got in the free but the guys had to get presale tickets.  Since we came super early, we had lots of time to roam around.

There is a large pool area, plenty of places to sit, and an indoor dance floor with tables, etc.   I hated the indoor area, it became so claustrophobic when Avicii came on that I had to leave.  The outdoor area became so crowded after that so I only listened to half of Avicii and I had to leave.  I did enjoy the poles that they had for girls to dance on.

I really expected it to be 5-star worthy because of all the insanely good reviews but I found it to be a liiiiiiiiiiiiiiittle disappointing. Still had an amazing time though, and it really was an awesome place! 

First off, it was a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be. I was expecting it to be as huge and open as Surrender, since it's in such close vicinity. I happen to still like Surrender better for that very reason. The night I went to XS, David Guetta performed so naturally the dance floor was beyond packed. I was so squished but it all was totally 100% worth it. I stepped outside for a bit, which was also insanely crowded but it was a really nice set up. The outside area was really cool, we still danced around a ton outside and it was much roomier than the inside dance floor. There's a ton of walk ways surrounding the dance floor where people ended up crowding and dancing because the dance floor was so packed.

I really don't have any tips besides maybe bring a flask. I tried to figure out a way to get in cheap, but XS is only concerned with having all girl groups coming into their club, so my girlfriend and I would have to pay full price. The line was about 15 minutes on a Monday during our spring break right at 1030 when they opened. Standing in line, we chatted it up with two girls behind us. Fun conversation, but the fact that they gave us their two free entry tickets made our night. Well designed club, but I wouldn't have been happy if I paid $30 to get in, and $17 for our one mojito. The large outdoor area was closed, but you could walk outside to get some fresh air. It was funny because they had a random dancer off in the distance dancing in front of the mirror, sweet job. Anyways, by 1130 the dance floor was ridiculous, packed to the brim and constant groups of people stopping your dancing to make their way through the crowd. I couldn't stand it. 

A couple of nights later we went to the Palms and paid $20 to get into ghost bar. My friends moved over to Moon, where our stamp from Ghost Bar got us in free. Huge club about 53 stories up at the Palms with an amazing view. We immediately went to the dance floor and there was some guy on a mic talking with a dj in the back. ""Oh this must be someone famous."" Turns out DJ Jazzy Jeff was playing that night. Words can't describe how much better of a time I had at Moon compared to XS, not nearly as crowded on the dance floor, amazing views, and a bad ass DJ keeping the energy up until 4am. XS was fun, but I'd take Moon any day.

On a standard weekend, the line is extremely long, so it'll take you forever to get in and sometimes the cover can go as high as $50. Even though XS is big and it extends into the pool area, it gets pretty crowded and it becomes difficult to navigate.

XS is so much better on weekdays because it's not as crowded, but there are still a good amount of people. It also doesn't take as long to order drinks on weekdays.

This club is always packed with beautiful people. hardly any wierdos running around. eye candy everywhere! bathrooms are huge, no long waits.... the only wait is OUTSIDE trying to get in. even table lines have a wait. make sure u get a hold of a club host before you plan on going with a bunch of people. and definitly show up early, cuz the traffic gets nasty outside. 

outside by the pool is definitly the best... or on the dance floor behind the ropes. they play some radio hiphop and electro\/house. very vegas music... my fave in vegas!!!

if u have friends that arn't into the club scene, they have a gambling pit outside by the pool. this club is the shit... been here so many times! u can't beat the scenery, this venue is absolutely beautiful.",2,0,0

My first visit to this club was in July, after hearing rave reviews from other Vegas veterans like myself.  We got a 3 bottles and a bed outside by the pool, but our experience was awful.  It was so hot outside that we were sweating beads and therefore uncomfortable, and the only misters were in the casino area.  The outside deejay was awful, which in turn made dancing outside awkward and annoying.  Our server was less than accommodating, and in fact, she was rude to us on several encounters, even telling us that the waters were free, then charging us $8\/pop.  Hardly a drop in the bucket since we were already dropping so much money on the bottles, but it would have been nice to be correctly informed.  We left by 2am (very early by Vegas standards and EXTREMELY early by our own standards), disappointed and wondering what the hell everyone else was thinking recommending the spot to us.  
I went back in October, because my sister turned 21, and her little friends had heard amaaaaaazing reviews of the spot.  We didn't get bottle service this time (we opted to get a table at Tryst the following night instead-- and loved it there, per usual), but we also didn't haveto pay cover due to a great hookup, which was nice, especially considering I didn't want to go there.  We spent the night on the dance floor and had a great time.  The outside bar was fun and made getting drinks a little easier than any of the inside bars.  The weather was also easier to deal with this time around-- it was warm but nippy, which is perfect dancing weather!  Three stars for XS until I make a third visit to make a final decision.  Perhaps next time we'll request a table right next to the dance floor or inside where all the action is.",0,0,0

I'm picky with music but in Las Vegas, you don't really go to the clubs to dance because most of the music played is really crappy mash-ups or the club is too packed and you can't C-walk or do the Dougie without getting booty bumped. Of course, you're usually too drunk to care about any of those things and you dance anyways. I digress.

My 3 stars are based on a 45 minute stay at XS. We got there on Monday at 1am, there was a small line but apparently some guy my boyfriend met in a bathroom was able to get us in ahead of the line for cheap, less than $20, and hey it worked! So we get in and it's packed, not packed like a weekend though. We found a spot to dance but it was too cramped. From where we were standing, it looked like the pool area wasn't open but we were too lazy to fight through the crowd to check out the situation. There was good hip hop playing for 30 minutes straight.

I'm only 26 and already cantankerous. Crowds make me grumpy and I don't have the energy to club all night...lame. If you're lame like me but curious about this place, you should come on a Monday.

On my second to last Vegas trip we stayed at Encore and so we decided to go see Steve Aoki on one of his resident nights at XS. As much as I love me some Aoki, he was off that night and his general electronica beats became way too dubsteppy. Towards the end of the night most people didn't bother trying to dance (or should I say spazz out) to the tracks anymore.

I had my fair share of free top-shelf drinks at the BlackJack and PaiGow tables before rolling into the club, so I decided to just drink water instead of dropping my life savings on the XS cocktails. That may have been the biggest mistake, as I slowly but surely sobered up and realized just how run down the club had gotten over the last couple of years. The inside smelled like vomit and gym locker room, the private tables and booths showed their rough abuse even in the dark, and the ground outside (pool side) was so sticky that I ""lost"" my high-heel sandals a few times as they decided to stick to the unidentifiable substances.

I am a local here in Las Vegas and I have been to a few different nightclubs in different hotels and I have never been treated so wrong. My brother and family came down this weekend and we all bought tickets to see Kaskade we got to the club and kind of reserved a section that we want to stand to see the DJ, as the night went one one of ladies in my party was sitting on the edge when a drunk man tried to hit on her and basically almost fell on her. When she said no get away and the drunk guy didn't listen her boyfriend told him please get back and away from her the drunk guy didn't listen and punched him in the face,so my brother grabbed the drunk guy and was holding him in a chock hold so he couldn't hit anyone else finally the security got there and escorted us out and kicked us out for fighting. When we tried to tell them that this guy hit us and we did nothing they didn't listen and told us they don't care and that we were involved in fighting. 

I was very angry because we all spent a lot of money on the tickets to see Kaskade perform and get kicked out because a drunk guy decided to punch my brother and didn't see the DJ at all.

It was my first time at Encore and the decor was beautiful. My girlfriend and I had to walk down this long hallway after checking in with one of the guys. It was a bit like silence of the lambs with rowdy drunk guys on the other side of the rope. Not all the guys were cat calling, of course but it was enough to make us feel uncomfortable. Once we got to the end, we had to basically walk up a narrow path flushed against the wall with those same guys on the other side. I think they just wanted some girls to get them in. 

XS was beautiful with multiple pools and great landscaping. Maybe it was still too early but it wasn't too crowded with people scattered about. So why were all those guys waiting outside for?

People weren't dancing but instead, they were sitting around or talking on their phones. A few were in the process of getting into the pool but it felt like prom with people waiting for the party to get started.

I came to XS Sunday Night Swim on Memorial Day Weekend and I got to say the Night Club lived up to its reputation. 

XS translates to ""Do everything in EXCESS, to BE EXCESSIVE""

Extravagant and beautiful, the venue boasts a patio with a pool that wraps around an island bar. Inside the club there is a DJ stage in an opulent room fit for royalty. 

Atmosphere: A Night Club is soulless without the people that make up the vibe. People are the art piece, the object that makes the room alive. And that night there were over 11,000 beautiful people at the night club...an all-time record attendance for a night club. You can see the link below. 

http:\/\/hauteliving.com\/2014\/05\/haute-event-avicii-breaks-xs-nightclubs-attendance-record\/491642\/

To illustrate how many people were at the club...You couldn't even see the water in the pool because there were so many bodies dancing in the pool. Even with all those people at the club I did not once feel packed. XS is very spacious and very well designed. 

Drinks: As for the drinks get the Adios Mother Fucker...it is hella strong...and if your baller there is a $10,000 cocktail called the Ono,,,and if you are a high roller you can always get a 30 L Vessel of Armand de Brignac for $100,000. 

So if you are ever in Vegas you must go to XS on Sunday Night! You will not be disappointed...you will experience so many great memories that will leave you with a Vegas high long after you have left the sin city =)",2,2,2

You walk in, big dance floor, there are so many bars that I can't even estimate the number. The drinks, IMO, weren't THAT outrageously priced. I ordered a vodka red bull for $12 and for vegas\/clubs in general, that doesn't seem crazy to me. I was definitely expecting more. The music was pretty good, I agree with Connie, they should get a better DJ. Something awesome that I found out is that XS makes MORE MONEY per square footage than the casino!!!! HOW CRAZY IS THAT!?!??!! The outside area is so awesome and I think this is what sets XS apart from the rest. You can walk around the pool and there's this island thing in the middle of the pool with another bar and gambling tables!!!!! SO AWESOME! So not only can you 1. get your groove on, 2. dance on tables, 3. order moderately priced drinks, 4. cool off by going outside, BUT you can also 5. gamble some more....! The crowd that night was overwhelmingly asian.

XS was definitely worth every penny. I don't usually say that a $20 cover (for girls, $30 for guys) is worth it, but in this case, it was 10000000% worth it. I will definitely be back at XS. Why would anyone go anywhere else in vegas??? :)",1,1,1

This place gets a lot of hype and rightfully so. The venue is what I call a hot girl-crazy paradox.  Since its inception, what's not to love about her? XS is sexy, gorgeous & attractive. Everyone wants to sample it... even if it means paying a premium price, but people (me included) tend to be blind-sighted when their smarter friends warn you otherwise. 

Chilling in the room, reminiscing how awesome the previous nights were (side note: the wraparound balcony suite at the cosmopolitan deserves a well 10 star out of 5 review... but that's a different story), one of my best friend says, ""hey, we should all go to XS tonight, I'll buy 4 tickets online. Avicii will be there"". Yup, with house\/trance being the mainstream these days, when you hear Avicii, Tiesto, or Gareth Emery... people like my friends automatically think it's going to be a good night. 

It was 9:30pm. We did the usual XS protocols. Go in before rush hour to get the usual two stamps... 1) for being 21+ 2) the other for re-entry. I like to address the ladder stamp being the most important. With their low quality stamp ink pads, make sure you get a FULL stamp. Not 1\/3... not even half...  not ... but a FULL stamp. Let me repeat that again... a FULL STAMP (like the ones you get at Disneyland)  

Later that night in the re-entry way, the security claims that my stamp wasn't clear enough for the club and that I had to immediately go back to general admission to purchase a new ticket. At that moment, I had the hot girl-crazy paradox epiphany... the illusion glass of hotness suddenly shattered and my realization of XS began.

 
1) XS's extra small dance floor
2) XS's poor handle of crowd control
3) XS's poor quality in bottle services 
4) XS's $19 red bull vodkas
5) XS's poor judgment in the definition of Excess. 


Like a hot-crazy girl, if you haven't experienced XS yet, you have to try it. It's something everyone must do and say, ""yup... I done it""; however, if the next time is going to be your 10th... stop while you're ahead. Keep the legendary memories behind you and don't let it get tainted with the XS it is now: overcrowded, overpriced and most of all... overhyped.

When we returned with proof of the card, they gave her the option of leaving with her belongings or going into XS with her marijuana nugget and pipe confiscated. We chose to leave. 

Is this Sin City?? Isn't gambling and alcohol and smoking indoors legal. They turn the other way for hookers but they threaten with police over a tiny bud of marijuana? 

And why are the bouncers at XS meticulously looking through a woman's purse? To see which brand of tampon she uses? 

It seems like the high school dropouts that were the bouncers at XS tasted a bit of authority and decided it's payback to the world. I don't think people should goto XS with a ziplock bag full of pot, but to be so anal about a speck of marijuana in a medical marijuana patient in a medical marijuana legal state such as Nevada seem like idiocracy. 

Overall, the whole experience at the Wynn and Encore and Parasol Down and XS were a complete disappointment due to repeated encounters with rude staff and fascist rules. At Parasol down, even our waitress was rude to us.... brings back memories of Paris. Don't they work on tips??

Girls, if you're on the guestlist, you don't have to pay cover! If you're lucky, you can even get a drink ticket or two.

For Skrillex, my guy friends had to pay $50 for cover though, but they said it was worth it. :)

Be advised that if your a guy, I would advise buying pre-sale tickets on a big night, like when Chainsmokers are there.

The place is almost always packed and the lines are ridiculous (and sometimes cover prices are as well depending on the weekend and the DJ spinning). I typically get bottle service here through my host (highly recommended) especially if you have a lot of guys in your group. If not, be prepared to wait in line for awhile, unless you go super early or if you can somehow get pre-sale tickets by staying at the hotel. My favorite table is on the dance floor patio since it is right on the outside of the club but faces the dance floor. Perfect location in my opinion. The inside is fairly large but the outside part of the club is even bigger. Great for walking around and exploring the scene. In the summer, the Sunday night event is a night time pool party which is a lot of fun - show up in board shorts\/bikinis instead of dressing up to go clubbing.

Overall one of the better clubs in Las Vegas but they know that so the prices can get a little out of hand for cover and for bottle service.",0,0,0

I'm not a fan of the indoor portion of the club. In fact, I'd probably avoid it in there altogether because it gets relatively stuffy and crowded.

But the outside.. the outside area is amazing. There's so much room to roam and frolic when the mood suits you, and what's even better is that there's tons of places to relax your feet without bouncers telling you that it's a bottle service only area.

They have so many tables that initially they ushered us to a daybed\/ enclosed area right amidst the pool. After that area got sold, they gave us our own cabana. And their cabanas are impressively large. Granted, I'm sure that us being 25 girls was likely a large determining factor. 

Even club-o-phobes can appreciate the less pretentious atmosphere that envelopes XS. Everyone's too busy having fun amongst their group to even prowl the crowd. We were able to  enjoy each other's company without having to swat douchebages away.

Being outside in the hot 85 to 90 degree weather at night brings out the sexy and popular in everyone. I tell you this I was a sexy beast that night. Weather I was pretending to dance in the front stage area where the dj was located in front of the pool or in the pool getting my feet wet with all the girls and a handful of their hating ass boy friends. Hey it wasn't my fault they bought the bullshit; I was just chit chatting and shooting the breeze. 

Let me get back to the stage because I can see a lot of really dope shows being played here. What if they were to throw a few secret shows only guest knew about like Ye and Jigga doing a show or hosting a pool party that would be crazy! 

Now imagine all the cute black girls there in ankle high water cause they can't get their hair wait, or asian, latinas, white girls going crazy in their two piece, one piece, or daisy dukes going crazy at a show?
And ladies just imagine what your type of guy would look like. 

You even get table service in the Cabanas or at a table on one of the many patios.  

XS is a great place to go H.A.M really even if you got baby money...",0,3,4

Got in through promoter but there was only access in pool\/patio area.  Bouncer\/security asked for money so we can get into the club where DJ David Guetta was gonna play.  Way too crowded.

Getting in\/SHITTY SERVICE: if you get in with a promoter they make it sound like they are doing you a huge favor by putting you in a special line. They tell you to get there early to apparently start letting people in at 10 so we get there at 9:45. We waited until almost 11 to get in with security. WHAT THE F***. When you are wearing high heels and your buzz has worn off and you have nothing to do in line for over an hour, that is bad service to your customers. Furthermore, plenty of groups of all girls are let through while you stand there and wait. Literally they walk up and the guy in front moves the rope to let them in. I am a female and I was there with my boyfriend and 2 other girls but no, they will make you wait. And when we finally got through, the man says ""ladies first"" to us so I ask ""him too right?"" about my boyfriend and the guy letting people through gives me the rudest look and starts to say ""wait a minute, let me make sure I understand what you're saying here..."" Basically making fun of me because apparently he meant the group gets in but the females walk in first, which I get, but do you have to be such a f*cking dick about it??

The service from the bartenders was great though so I want to make sure that is included.

Price: it is only moderately expensive unless you get in with a promoter. So in that case girls were free and guys were $40. OH WAIT. That only gets you to the outside area and its $50 to go inside for girls and $100 for guys. And there is no where to sit besides the edges of the planter boxes or the $5k booths and cabanas. Seriously? 

Music: We were there to see DJ Snake. He did a good job. He was creative and the music was good. The music was good before he started too.

Hours: it said it started at 10 but didn't let us in until 11 and also the DJ timing was bad. It was a lot of fun listening to him, I mean he did a good job DJing but didn't start until almost 2am. I realize it's Vegas but that is way too late. We stayed until 4 because I wanted to hear my favorite song but apparently he was going to play until 6am so we left. City that never sleeps I guess but I like my sleep.

Atmosphere: it was a fun place. I wish we didn't have to pay so much just to be inside but outside as cool. Once you find your spot among the bushes, it's okay. The nice thing was the pool. You could put your sore feet from being in line in the water. Ironically they shoot out dollar bills over the water and somebody will usually jump in to get it, probably trying to get back some of the money they were forced to spend here.",1,4,0

When we went to dinner at SW the line was already forming around corners, and then when we came back are 12am, the line was all the way to the Wynn.  I don't know why people would want to wait in line hoping they may get in...

You walk inside and there are wall to wall people.  Then the club parts in the middle (kinda like moses departed the red sea) and you see the outdoor pool with a terrace and gambling tables.  

And go-go dancers on top of the bars.  It took awhile to push our way through the hordes of people to get to the bar and I was kinda taken aback at how dirty the glasses were.  I watched the bartender pour shot after shot of things in spotted shot glosses.  I got kinda grossed out.  

I must be getting old, because I'm not really into the ""club"" scene anymore, but this is without a doubt one of the cooler clubs I've ever been to.  I think we lasted about 45 minutes and then left, but it was definitely a place to experience.  For the partier, this place goes until about 4am.",2,3,2

Why?

1. No line.  Like I'm talkin' zero wait time EVEN DURING Memorial Day Weekend 2013.  There was a fast-moving line just to get your ID's checked and get your hand stamped, but other than that, very smooth sailing.  This is a DREAM in contrast to pretty much all other nightclubs during MDW2013.

2. Venue is HUGE.  Or maybe the layout just seems huge?  There's a gigantic pool with bottle service tables surrounding it, upstairs tables that overlook the pool area, a bar outside, a bar inside, dance floor, (some) lasers\/lights, and beautiful men\/women errwhere.  There were even some (very few) places for us ladies to sit and rest our feet.  I'm not sure if we were allowed to sit in these places, so I won't be naming them on here for now.

3. Dress code.  More casual than normal Las Vegas attire, which is awesome for girls tired of tight dresses and sky-high stilettos.  We came here on our last night in Vegas, so we were definitely ready to get comfortable and party up!

4. Drinks.  The bar actually wasn't as crowded as other places we went to during MDW2013, and the pours were heavy.  

5. Clean bathrooms and private stalls.  I'm talkin' about stalls that actually have walls that go up to nearly the roof, and a real door with a handle and a lock.  I love how I can't hear everything going on in the stall next to me, and that they make the stalls look more homey, which makes me more comfortable being in it!

6. Variety.  There seemed to be a large variety of people.  Older and younger, dressy and more casual, in groups and in pairs, girls and guys, and in every race you can think of.

7. Guest DJ.  As one of the more popular venues in Vegas, they bring in the popular DJs.  For instance, we came to XS specifically to see David Guetta, one of my faves!

One interesting rule is you cannot bring any drinks (even in water bottles or anything) anywhere near the line.  I was trying to finish some stuff we were pregaming and the guy at the entrance to the line said I had to be walking in order to drink.  So....I paced up and down the hallway until I was done.  I really didn't think that was necessary since I was still in plain sight to everyone entering the club.

It is owned by the same owner as Tryst, so that can give you some idea of what to expect.  Even though it is similar to Tryst, it has a way different vibe.  The crowd is a lot younger and more attractive.  It has a more laid back energy, maybe because of the large pool area or the great use of outdoor space, but either way the feel of the club was like nowhere else in Vegas.
When you first walk in there is a bar on you left, a sunken dance floor and a huge open wall overlooking a gigantic pool.  Around the dance floor are raised stages with stripper pools.  I'm not talking the cheap pool in the corner of the club, but ligit raised stages with stairs, a gold pool to the ceiling, a light up clear floor.  When you get to the outside it is littered with dozens of VIP tables and a group of second story cabana tables.  The music was great and so was the table service.  We got bottle service at a table just outside the dance floor overlooking the pool.  The table was nice but the cushions on the bench were a pain.  They keep falling off every time we got up. 
 However, XS has the best nightclub bathroom in all of Vegas.  It was massive and ladies you know how much it sucks to stand in a long line in heels with a bunch of hot mess girls when all you have to do is pee.  The line moved so fast, there must have been like 30 stalls.  They also put mirrors along a wall all by themselves so you can get in & out quickly when all you need to do is powder your nose.
On the negative side, the lines were ridiculous, even for the bottle service.  I have never seen such a massive amount of people trying to get into a club in Vegas. We had connections with the owner so we didn't have to wait.  But if I had to drop that kind of cash for a table, I would be pissed off with size of the line.  Not sure if it is due to the newest of the club or if because of the size they have a bigger capacity for guests?  But it was a long line from the time we sat at our table around 11 to when we left at 3ish.  The bartenders were also kind of rude.  I guess they are still working out the kinks, but overall a great night.
I would highly recommend it for anyone.  Just be prepared to arrive early, wait in line and have an amazing time and the best thing about XS is it is only a short walking distance from Tryst!!!!",1,0,0

Yes, this club is very pretty.  That part is not up for debate.  My issue with XS is that since it is the club du jour, everyone and their 3rd cousin are trying to get in, are already in or will be getting in.  This causes the following problems:

*  The dance floor is overly crowded
*  Everywhere not the dance floor is overly crowded
*  The clientele seem to either be on edge or maintain some smug sense of superiority which leads to giving me the stank eye when I smile at them.

Thankfully we reserved everything through Sienna, so my group and I didn't have to deal with the stress of waiting in line or paying for cover.

The beds in the pool were a kitsch idea but a huge pain in the ass.  I would rather lounge on these while my ass is busting out of a bikini.

So in closing, I wouldn't necessarily mind making a 2nd jaunt through XS, but it definitely wouldn't be my first choice... or second or third for that matter.",3,3,2

Some of the staffs here are absolutely rude and is only trying to scam you. My friends and I recently turned 21 so we decided to go clubbing because that's what basically everyone does in Vegas. I looked on Yelp and found a ""promoter"" named ""Kenny Lo"" who said he could get in 4 girls for free in the expedited line and would get unlimited drinks throughout the night while my 2 guys would have to pay $40 but will get 1 free drink. We arrived there before 11 and were able to get in to the pool area perfectly through the guest list line. However along the way, since it was my first time, while we were going through the line, the manager wanted to stamp my hand and I told him I was already stamped. He then told me ok and to proceed on. I then walked a few feet and looked at the complimentary drink card that I got and said out loud ""only 1 free drink?"". I said this out of confusion because I was told by Kenny Lo that we would get unlimited drinks. I then turned back to ask my 3 other girl friends who were trying to get the 3rd stamp and one of the staffs heard me and told the manager to not give me another stamp just because I said ""only 1 free drink?"" I think it's completely stupid that he agreed to not give me a stamp just because I said something that I was confused about. Is it so wrong for me to voice my concerns? And the fact that the manager did not give my 3 other friends the 3rd stamp too just because I said that I have my hand stamped already is completely bullshit. My friends did not even say anything but sorry that I did not know and he still did not want to give us the stamp. I don't see what I or we did wrong for him to deny us the last stamp. What kind of FUCKEN manager is he? I was told by one of the staffs inside the hotel that the manager for this club is a douchebag and I absolutely agree. I asked many girls who were outside in the pool area and they were also cheated for not receiving a 3rd stamp which also prevented them from entering the nightclub. We then proceeded to make our way inside of the clubbing pool area and waited in line for about 1.5 hours outside trying to get inside the club only to find out later that we actually needed the 3rd stamp to get in. We went back to the line we were at before to ask the manager about it and he responded by being a complete dick. He said he tried multiple times to give me the last stamp, but that's bullshit. He only tried ONCE and just because I told him I already had 2 stamps, he decided to not tell me that I actually need 3 to get into the nightclub and the only way to get in now was to pay $40. This manager is rude and needs to be fired. How the hell is he even a manager?! His behavior and attitude is disgusting and awful. 2 of my girl friends decided to pay the $40 and had to go to the reentry line to get in. I however, decided to wait because I had to go find my other girl friend who was saving our spot in the line of the pool area. When I found her, the guest list line closed and we were no longer able to pay the $40 to get in. We then walked around to see what we could do about it and I spotted Kenny and stopped him. I told him my situation and also told him that my guys actually paid $100 instead of $40 to get in and he said he would find someone to see what he could do about it. We followed after him until we were stopped outside of the entrance and decided to wait for him outside. He texted me and told me he would get back to me in a few and he NEVER did. I messaged him multiple times and called him and he still didn' respond. What kind of promoter is he? DO NOT TRUST HIM. He will not help you in any way. Even IF he did try to help me and was not able to find a solution, he did not bother to even tell me and just ran away missing..that is just so foolish of him. This Kenny Lo guy is a phony.

- It's the Asian club of Vegas. Almost all Asians come to either XS or Tao.  
- Most of the Asians are either from So Cal or Nor Cal
- During the summertime, every single weekend will be packed. 
- You'll likely bump into people you casually know\/knew in college at UCLA, UC Irvine, Berkeley or USC (...followed by the awkward hello or glance...or glare.) 
- If you meet someone, chances are they know some of your friends. It's not 6 degrees of separation, more like 2 degrees of separation at XS. Good or a bad thing? You can decide.

ADMISSION:  We went on a monday night, at 11:45pm, a girl with two guys.  Supposedly ""industry"" night, which I guess is when the locals come out to play?  Anyway, the lines weren't too long, of course crowded around the rope.  They let you in with a carbon copy ticket with your names and the # of ppl coming in with you.  We were supposed to have been put on the guest list by a friend who works at the Wynn, but the girl with the list didn't find us on there.  Nevertheless, I never felt ignored by her (as some pretentious club workers do, very annoying) - and even though she didn't find us on the list after she really tried hard to find our names, she let us in all in for free anyways.  Already a plus!

VENUE:  Very beautiful and trendy looking inside.  Beautiful decor, beautiful people everywhere, as expected for the Encore hotel.  See the other reviews and pics about the place - loved the inside-outside aspect of it, and if it weren't the end of January, I would been outside by the pool!  

SERVICE:  Bars weren't TOO crowded, and bartenders were pretty fast.  All the women bartenders and cocktail waitresses had beautiful attire (creme colored sequin tops with sweetheart necklines  - so cute, made me want to work here almost, haha).    The bathrooms had attendants in bow-ties that guided you to the next open bathroom, and they didn't bug you about tipping them, not even a tacky tip jar on the counter.  AND the stalls had a little shelf for your drink.  Yay!

CROWD:  As I stated above, beautiful people everywhere.  But what I liked about this place is that they also had a very mixed crowd- people dressed up in suits and expensive cocktail dresses, people dressed in costume-like outfits (I think I saw a peacock-type dress on a gal) as well as ""normal"" people dressed more casually.  Young and old.  Reserved and wild. I loved it!  

I also loved that there were stripper poles and stages throughout the club where you could people watch - so many drunk girls showing their goods ""by accident""?  Never seen such classy girls show so much butt crack and leg and pretend to be strippers.  LOL.  I think they made the tables in a way to allow people to hang out and put their drinks down around the outsides since they have a little place to prop your foot and put your drinks down.  A plus for those looking for a spot to chill in between dances.

DRINKS = PRICEY.  Minus half a star for this.  A crown and diet coke was $12.  And from the reviews on the table prices, ridiculous! ($475 per 3 people, do the math!!!)  Please PREGAME at the casinos and save your loot for food afterwards!  Haha.  But really, I guess it's expected for such a trendy club in vegas.

MUSIC - loved it!  Apparently it was DJ Shift, who played a great mix - especially loved the mash-ups.  He played mostly hip hop, top 40s, and house-y type music.  The only thing that would have made it better is if he played 80s!  My fav.

OVERALL- Awesome - Possibly one of the best I've been to.  Had everything I was looking for in a club - beauty everywhere, fun, great music and atmosphere, and clean.  And the staff didn't seem too uptight both letting you in and while you were in.  Definitely check this place out if you ever go to Vegas looking for a great place to party!",1,0,1

While he was performing, more people came in and the place was so crowded to the point where it was very unsafe (people were pushing each other).  

Please understand that I am a big guy and I have worked as a bouncer here and there last 7 years which include top clubs in LA and San Francisco so I am very familiar with crowd control.  It eventually reached the point where I felt ""very unsafe"" so I left.   

We went to Marquee next night.  Ironically, bouncers there handled the crowd very well - they were making sure that dance floor was not overcapacity.  

I hate to say this but XS management needs to put the safety first...",1,0,0

Friday night: we land @ 9:30pm, check into our hotel, and hang out. We were getting drunk at random bars and someone decided to walk over to XS. I get a text message later, ""Head over, it's $30 and the line isn't bad."" Keep in mind it was 1:40am. I didn't believe him until I showed up because I already heard all the horror stories. Five minutes later, $30 later, we were all in. It was about 2am and this place was still out of control. I think we bailed close to 4am. I wasn't able to comprehend the time by then. Lost a few friends along the way, but saw them the next morning for lunch. Must have been that good then, right?

Saturday night: got in the table line at 9:05pm. A friend put us on reservations for 10 guys, which comes out to 4 bottles (supposedly every 3 people = 1 bottle and we were one head over so we had to round up). Got in around 9:55pm and got a cabana on the outside, 2nd floor. It was a bit far from the inside\/dancefloor but it worked out. I believe if you want a table inside, you have to buy a certain amount of bottles? While walking to our cabana, the host said there's about 4000 people in line right now (supposedly there are sensors in the hallways that works as markers which estimates the amount of people in line). Who knows how many more people were in line later on.

This place is massive. You're bound to lose your friends if you don't keep track, have a plan, or a ""homebase.' There's thousands upon thousands of people. Almost everyone is dressed to impress as they should be. The venue is monsterous and classy. The people are good looking and sexy. Ran into a lot of Cali peeps too.

We didn't plan on partying at XS both nights this past weekend, only Saturday night but I'm glad we did. It was that good. I'm usually not too impressed with Vegas clubs because they're all the same: claustophobia issues, humid\/suffocating, and just too crazy that it drains all the fun. However, I am really impressed with XS. They have really set the expectation bar for how Sin City's clubs should be.

Random last notes: Don't accidentally fall into the pool. Watch your step. You can gamble (BlackJack) inside the club but I wouldn't if you're really wasted and can't comprehend (just a suggestion). Keep the drama at home and just have a good time.",3,4,4

Las Vegas is it's own party bubble atmosphere and XS is definitely one of the highlights of that party. The serene, elegant, lavish, sexy, and bold environment and decor are both refreshing and exciting. It is one of the most spacious and welcoming clubs in LV with a wide indoor dancefloor, VIP seating, and luxurious high ceilings with chandeliers that sparkle with the lighting. But wait until your bright doey eyes behold the outdoor patio equipped with a full poolside bar, beautifully lit, large pool, a lovely nightsky view, and even more space to shake that thang!!! The crowd is a mix of happy party-goers, mostly young in age having a good time. I haven't been there when the pool is open, but I'm excited for that on my next trip.

I don't know how much cover is, but I'm sure it's worth it for the people that have to pay. However, tip for the girls: Talk to the random promoters along the strip because they can get you into clubs (including XS) for free through the guestlist! We even got a few guys in for free. So make sure you spread your social butterfly wings and make friends in Vegas because it pays off! I went to the bar earlier so its wasn't too hard to get a drink, but I saw that it got crowded later in the night, so be prepared. The danclefloor in and out are spacious enough and built in a way to prevent too much cramping and crowding, which is a plus. The bouncers\/security are generally nice and helpful, especially considering the crazies and drunks they have to deal with... one of my friends had to be ""politely escorted"" out.. haha.

The pool dominates the outdoor space, and there are some giant, awesome beds that lay in the shall end of the pool.  There were 7 girls with my group and all of us were able to chill on one bed.

It was packed but the difference between this place and say Tryst (my former #1 club in Vegas) is that the outside features a pool with floating sofas so cool!...and in the middle of the pool was a gazebo bar with poker tables WHAT!!!

The vastness of the club feels freeing, although they pack this place up. People everywhere getting wild like a Hollywood hills mansion party. The decor looks out of a vanity fair photo shoot. It's just all unreal. You do feel like you are dreaming and the walls could melt around you. And disappear. 

I couldn't begin to review this place after being here only twice. I feel like I need at least 20 more nights here to begin to take it all in. I will be updating as my relationship with XS develops. 

XS is a Vegas 'must'  for every person who wants to be at the 'it' club every Friday night which is what this town is made of. Shit, XS is the studio 54 of sin city. It's evil, I swear. 

So on that note, brace yourself. Here's the negative side, the lines were ridiculous, even for the bottle service.  I have never seen such a massive amount of people trying to get into a club in Vegas. When you decide to drop that kind of cash for a table, I would be pissed off with waiting grouped into the heaps of ""regular"" people. So get a table here or I wouldn't personally bother going at all. That's just my style go big or don't bother. There is no way in hell you'll ever catch me standing anxiously in line for a club for 1-2 hours like some people do. 

If you don't know someone good luck! I personally knew a promoter, had a table lined up, and still waited 5-10 minutes to get in here. Which I would never normally do but XS is worth breaking most social standards I've set for myself. ;)

But all in all XS is the nicest, sickest club I've ever seen. Honestly this place could get 5 stars from the bathroom and the outdoor element alone. Seems like a very amped up version of tryst. With the added pool and cabanas outside it's a very beautiful way to celebrate life in style.",4,3,3

Once I arrived I had to wait in the ""table line"" for over 1 hour, I had to ""grease' and additional $400 and when he finally walked me into the club he informed me I could not get a daybed and tried sitting me at a tiny little bistro table with 3 chairs around it stuffed in a corner. I told him I wanted my money back, after a very heated discussion I finally got my grease money back and walked out of the club. We saw this happening to countless people...DON'T TRUST WHAT THEY TELL YOU WHEN YOU MAKE TABLE RES, I WAS LATER TOLD BY A DOOR PERSON THEY HAVE A NEW  TABLE POLICY AND OVERBOOK THEIR TABLES BY 300% AND GIVE THEM TO THE HIGHEST BIDDERS WHEN YOU ARRIVE, BASICALLY AUCTIONING THEM OFF TO PEOPLE IN LINE AND WASTE OVER AN HOUR OF YOUR EVENING...VIP, LOL I THINK NOT!!!!

This is Seriously the best club I have EVER been to. I didnt have any problems with bouncers or anything.. I was given the opportunity to cut the line.. but i did had to pay the 20 Dollar cover.. My Boyfriend and his friends went early and got in with no problems and their cover was 30.. not too bad for a Vegas club.. I guess

I went back in Feb. but The memories are still Fresh in my mind.  got in and all I could do was look  around at the Lovely Decor! Plenty of Stripper Poles! inside was kind of crowded but outside...

OUTSIDE... You can DANCE in the POOL! I mean, at what club can you do that??? I can't wait to go back when its 101 degrees outside (at midnight)... 

anyways.. there is tons of walking\/dancing room outdoors and if you look hard enough. you'll find the blackjack table on the other side of the pool.

Ok so they were the golden sculptures of the female body that overlook the bars and the sexy theme is continued throughout the nightclub.  XS definitely does not stand for extra small as this club has plenty of room for drinking, dancing, and watching the several go-go dancers.

Atmosphere:
XS is extravagant, extraordinary, and exceptional.  Plenty of details were taken care of at this sister nightclub to Tryst from the dancefloor opening into the pool area to the state of the art sound system.  Music is not too loud or obnoxious and the lighting is just right without feeling as if you're inside a laser light show.  The DJ spun a random mix of Top 40, hip hop, and some house, but I wasn't impressed with the song selections. The crowd on the night I attended was a decent mix of people and uncrowded.  It was a Sunday, so I didn't expect much.  Less people means easier to order a drink at the bar.

Drinks:
Plenty of choices and prices that are what you would expect from Vegas, meaning way too much.  It was my b-day so I got plenty of free drinks anyway.

Line:
On the Sunday I attended there was a minimal wait in line from what I could see, but I didn't have to worry as I was ""on the list.""  The next evening a Monday night there seemed to be a very very long line and I'm glad I didn't have to wait in it.  No line for the bathroom, which is major plus as well.

Overall, great club!  I would go back in a heart beat, especially if I'm staying at the Wynn or Encore.  I would like to go back on a busier night to compare it.  Probably would have given another star, but I'm pretty jaded with nightclubs as I've been going way too long and way too often.",2,2,1

XS is the shit when the first couple of times I went, I won't lie about it. The place is amazing and even if the music is not for me, I still have fun. But the problem lies in the staff. 

Staff:  The staff kills the rating of this place totally. I didn't want to resort to this but since XS hired these people, I'm guessing they represent XS to the fullest and what they stand for. First off, I understand how vegas works with a group of guys and such. I understand they are not going to let hella guys in. That's a fact. But when I'm in front of the line and you stop me there for 3 hours, that's plain disrespectful and rude. I understand that the ""bouncers"" take their ""fair share"" so guys can go in, but to leave me for 3 hours at the front of the line and didn't even greet me, that was the last straw. Not only that, I was disrespected at the register by the cashiers because I guess they thought it was funny seeing me stand at the front of the line and not move. Hilarious I tell you. I normally do not write bad reviews, but for this place to irk me this bad-- I just couldn't believe it. 

Final Verdict: Go here if you like, it's a cool place...but again just make sure you don't mind being treated like low class citizens. Just so you all won't think I'm just being a little cry baby, I decided to do a test on Saturday night at the BEST club in Vegas at the busiest night also, MARQUEE. Get this....me and my friends already got bottle service so no need to wait in line, but to prove a point, I made us wait in the general admission line anyway. So as I waited in line, 3 staff from MARQUEE came up to us and greeted us and was very polite to us. When they found out we had a lot of guys he let us know that it would be a long wait. Maybe an 1 hour or so before we get in. Again, I understand Vegas, so I was cool about it. Within the next 15 minutes or so, another staff member came back to us to check on us and made sure if everything was ok. DAMN what great service and staff. See that's all it takes. After that we just left to the bottle service line and got in. MARQUEE's staff stood out and was very pleasant. XS not only did you just lose a client, you lost all respect with me.

A part of me will always be there, literally and I'll explain why later.

My friends and I were in Vegas for 5 days, and I know everyday is a party there but we only really wanted to go clubbing once, so we decided to go to XS. I hear from many people that its usually bumpin here and Marquee. 

My wonderful friend Shige O. and his friend Mike, got me and my girlfriends to avoid the long lines and into the wonderful atmosphere.

Drinks are mega expensive, I was warned beforehand by my boyfriend but when you're happy, then it doesn't matter what price you pay to be happier. 

From what I remember, it was Beautiful inside. Really crowded though! Majority of the night we were outside by the pool. There were maybe one - four people sitting on a float in the pool but its pretty much winter so that was the most you'll find in the pool. I'm surprised I didn't fall in by the end of the night but I think my phone did. 

Like I said earlier, the atmosphere was wonderful. We ran into two bachelor parties. They were all nice. They didn't believe that we were from Hawaii and that was another amusing conversation in itself. 

Overall I had such a great time that I lost my half of my phone and my ring there (I trust that my friends didn't let me marry a random stranger and gave my ring away) So there it is, what happens in Vegas sure does stay in Vegas!

I'd recommend people to party here if they're visiting Vegas. Its hard to be back at home and clubbing after going to a club like that!",0,3,1

I haven't been there before the renovation to compare how it was, but my goodness XS is BEAUTIFUL. Like drop dead gorgeous beautiful. You know, the type that your jaw just drop and a lost of breath the moment you see a 10 passing by. Just stunning, my absolute favorite club in Vegas! 

We went to see Zedd, I believe he's a resident DJ there and boy was it dope. There was nothing better than chilling by the pool with the perfect outdoor temperature and seeing graphics on a projector screen. There is a main dance floor on the inside, but that it was quite crowded being a 3 day weekend for a lot of people. That's ok, we had plenty of fun if not more fun being outside. You can actually walk up to the floor and dip your feet in. There are several bars outside so you can definitely survive just staying outside the whole time, it would be even better if you have a table. Ladies, we all know we can get very far being dolled up in Vegas, eventually you will somehow get pulled into a booth so that is not even an obstacle. 

I made it a point to always have to return to this specific venue whenever we are in Vegas. It's located in the Wynn Encore Hotel. Weekends can get pretty busy even if you are on the guest list because the line isn't right in front of the club, you have to follow signs that will take you to the real line so just heads up, don't show up thinking there is nobody. Line went by pretty fast though and once you're in, you will just be amazed and forget about all life's worries in such a SEXY environment. XS, my love for you just won't stop!",4,0,4

Sooooo when I was tasked with planning my bestie's bachelorette party in Vegas, I knew what I had to do! Get on the guestlist for XS on Saturday night. I used Dave V. (702) 481 5951 and Brian (408) 896-5160. Skipped the line & headed to a separate entrance for guestlist. No charge + 2 complimentary drinks (valued at $20 each) for each girl in my group. SWEEEEETTTTTT. Did I mention I love being a girl sometimes??

IN DA CLUB

Anyway, XS was fabulous as always. Inside: CROWDED like no other. Literally, just moving through the inside was a nightmare, and it feels like everything is grinding against everyone, even if you're just trying to walk around. But- the key is if you're intoxicated enough, all that doesn't really matter that much. Everyone is just curious about everyone and wants to have a good time. It is the COMPLETE opposite of those awkward high school dances where no one is on the dance floor because they're afraid of looking dumb.

Oh no, here at XS people have no fear. You'll meet lots of strangers, some creepy and weird, some smelly, some who you can't understand, and perhaps even a charming young man who will become your future hubby, WHO KNOWS! And that's the fun of this whole place. There are also lots of beautiful people here. 

OUTSIDE DA CLUB

Outside- oh yea. A club with music & dancing both inside & out. That's a MUST for every girly girl\/human being who doesn't want to walk out of the club drenched in sweat...and not necessarily all your sweat either! Ewwwww, yes I know. Been there, done that, which is why you must pick a club with both an outdoor + indoor. Duh. 

The pool areas are well lit and create a romantic ambience. The DJ will blast music from inside but you'll see him\/her on the big screen outside too. Just look at the pics on here, XS is gorgeous.

MUSIC

When I visited last weekend, Will.I.Am was here (and Flavor flav- um weird) and did not disappoint by playing hip hop & pop tunes that the girls and I sang and danced to all night long. I am one of those weirdos who do not like the trancey\/housey\/dj beats\/ravey type of music with no words. In fact, I hate that, so I was very happy to finally listen to some plain, overplayed radio shiz. It was great! 

TAXI SERVICE

OMG. If you party all night & try to catch a cab outside the hotel- the lines will be VERY LONG. We waited probably about 30min or more after XS to catch a ride back to our hotel. Not sure how to avoid this issue, but just be prepared w\/ some fast flats or something!

Bottom line is- if you stop at XS during your Vegas trip, you'll be sure to have a good time. It's always a safe bet in my book!

TIP- if you're coming in here with a big group of girls, don't pay, just get on a guest list and make sure not to go too late!",6,1,2

Unfortunately, this was NOT the case at all. 

When we initially got to the club, we were able to get through the entrance area fairly quickly.  We were then taken around to the very back of the club to a table in the outside area.  Our server was initially super nice to us. Things were going great.  We placed an order for three bottles of Vodka and our mixers and started gearing up for a fun night.  

When our server disappeared to go grab the bottles, that's when things quickly went downhill.  As we were sitting around waiting on the comfy chairs, two ginormous cockroaches scurry into our cabana.  It was absolutely disgusting.  Fortunately, as the rest of us were screaming, my sister tried to step on them to keep them from coming closer to us.  Those little buggers were still twitching afterwards.  We complained to the hostess and she then turned into a royal biotch.   She gave us the worst kind of attitude and then took the bottles of alcohol that she brought to our table away.  It was so condescending and rude.  She actually ended up bringing the alcohol back and then taking it away again about two more times as we were waiting to hear back from the manager.  As if we would actually drink the bottles without getting our situation sorted out.  The manager comes out and promises to do his best to move us and\/or comp us a bottle....SOMETHING to help us feel better about things.  He then comes back about half an hour later and tells us there is nothing he can do.  It is summer time and it's nature.  Really?  You have a multi-million dollar club in Vegas and you can't even keep your tables clean?  Have you heard of Terminex?  Round-up even? I mean, we understood it is part of nature, but we were in a three-walled table space (and not in the outside pool area) in one of the most profitable night clubs in Vegas.  The fact that we also had to deal with attitude from our server and be told that the club wasn't even willing to comp us what would be a $20 bottle of champagne is absolutely ridiculous - the worst service I have ever experienced.  What about swapping us out with an upstairs table that was occupied with men since arguably it might not bother some guys as much as it did our group of girly ladies?  The least they could have done was give us a comped bottle of wine or champagne.  At the end of the day, we waited an entire hour to find out what the club could do for us, which turned out to be absolutely nothing of course. They absolutely were not thinking. Their message was essentially take or leave the table because they don't give a rats azz about us.  

Because it was my bachelorette and we wanted to enjoy whatever time we had remaining, my friends just decided to stay.  It was just hard to have any respect for the manager and our original hostess.  The manager had heard us talking about not leaving any gratuity, so he then tells us that he will swap out our server just so we can start fresh (i.e., they want to collect our gratuity).  He ended up replacing our original hostess with the sweetest replacement host.  At least they recognized how big of a biotch the original hostess was being.  When another cockroach came scurrying into our table, she freaked out also and told us she felt horrible.  She tried to move us again or do something, ANYTHING to compensate us, but she came back and basically told us the same story.  We actually have a conscience (unlike the people we were dealing with), so we gave the replacement hostess the full 20% tip.  

Honestly, I have never felt so marginalized and disregarded when spending thousands of dollars on $50 bottles of alcohol the club is making a hefty profit on.

I went with my friends on the Saturday during President's Day weekend. The line was probably like a mile long i swear, but I think because we had a group of 13 decent looking girls, they just let us cut everyone lol. I didn't realize how long the line was until we passed by all these angry faces. So to avoid waiting in line, just bring a big group of girls, with several decent looking ones, and waiting in line shouldn't be a problem. 

The club was very decent size, pretty big actually. I would say this club is more for the young crowd.. all in the 20's and early 30's.. and they are primarily asian. There is an outdoor pool area with a bar, and plenty of areas to sit and just chill. You don't have to worry about the cold, there are heated lamps everywhere lol. 

Drinks are pretty expensive there, so I would recommend either pre-gaming a little before heading there rather than making all your drink purchases there.. unless you're planning on having the men buy you drinks there.. which I am sure they would. Seriously I have never been to a club with more generous guys haha. 

Overall the music was great, location was GORGOUS, area was pretty spacious, and the men are very generous haha

With the promo line you can skip the usual 1-2 hour line and $55\/person cover charge, so make getting on it a priority. To do so you need at least a group that is even ratio'd, so at least one girl for every guy, second you have to text one of the club promoters. You can either find their number online or find it in the video that is posted in the pictures section on yelp.
        This is probably the best club I have been too. It may be expensive but the venue attracts an attractive crowd, sports several pools, great EDM and an electric atmosphere. You are paying for these amenities not just at entry but also with every drink, the minimum is $12 and that gets you a domestic beer. 
        My wife and I came here for the Sunday Pool Party, the only time the pools are open to bathers. We did not realize it was a special night so we didint bring out bathing suits, this was quickly remedied however when we purchased new ones sporting the XS logo. The water was warm and lights\/ music blaring as we danced in the pools. By 11am the place was crammed near capacity with people although it never took too long to get a drink. A hot tub was also ready to go. We originally thought we would spend two hours here but ended up going for 4-5 because the environment and music made it so fun.

Hand's down my favorite venue and possibly the most beautiful club in Las Vegas.  If you aren't familiar with it, xS consists of an inside main room and also an outdoor patio\/pool area. The venue itself is HUGE..easily fits in 1000s of people if you count the outside area.

Easiest way to get in is with BOTTLE SERVICE...haha no shit right? But it's true. Main room tables go easily in the 5k minimum range (depending on DJ talent) and tables are cheaper in the outside area. If your hosts tell you to arrive early MAKE SURE YOU DO, because xS sells out. So if you're getting a lower end table be sure to follow through with your host or else you're table will get sold and you'll have to grease your way into acquiring another table. I seen the bottle line be as long as general admission lines at other clubs sometimes. 

Other then that, girls always get the easy entrance. But for my male counterparts out there, the easiest way to get in without dropping a couple grand for bottle service is with with presale tickets. You pay about half of the door cover price. Highly recomended if it's a big name DJ like Avicii, David Guetta, or Afrojack.

My favorite party in town is xS Sunday Night Swim. Nighttime pool party on Sunday nights in the summer. I always used to leave Vegas on Sunday until I discovered this party, now I always stay on Sunday nights! And don't look like a newbie, majority of people show up in dayclub attire!

If you're looking for less of a tourist crowd and less hassle to get into the club, Monday nights is xS industry nights. Bottle minimums are alot lower and its super easy to get inside.

So many nightclub reviews compared their club to XS, that we figured XS had to be one of the places to check out.  We went on a Friday night.

We ended up eating at Wynn, so we were already there.  Got in line early, around 10ish.  First, they pulled us off the main line to let us get in express - she looked fantastic and while I always thing I just look like a baboon with a suit on, she told me it was partially because of me, too.  So, first piece of advice, dress to the nines.

The first problem though is after we got pulled off, we were told my girlfriend could get in for free, but I had to pay.  No problem with that, so we get out of the express line to go to the girls in for free line, but then we were told (after we already got out of line) the girls getting in for free have to go in through separate entrances - meaning I would have had to leave her alone for god knows how long while I waited in line.  Why in the world would you do that Wynn?  What would be wrong with either letter her in without paying in the main line, or letting me go with her and I'll just pay?  We thought that was really messed up, and rather then get separated, she decided she'd just pay the cover.  Thankfully, one of the security people let us right back to the front of the cover charge line and we got in fairly quickly.

I'll admit that if I was only reviewing our first 60-90 minutes, this place would get a 4 (and would have gotten a 5 if not for the issue above).  It is beautiful.  Dance floor is a bit small, but the club opens up to the pool outside, and it was a mid April evening and it was beautiful.  I really liked it at first.  The second problem though was once they started packing it in.  Saying it was like sardines doesn't do it justice.  Sardines are each given their own condos compared to how packed they filled this place.  And while my girlfriend and I try to be respectful of all of the people jammed together, and just dance with short moves, the idiots in this place were still dancing as if they had the whole floor to themselves.  I can't tell you how many people I had to shove off of us.

Like you'll see in many reviews, I am sure if we had a VIP table, it would have been a different experience, but we didn't have the money to spend.

Last problem was the music.  It was all house.  I know that's what people want, and that's fine, but I just don't get it.  I go to clubs that mix in some house, but play heavy top 40, hip hop, etc, and everyone is dancing, singing along, and having a great time.  Maybe I'm just getting too old (35), but I just hated the music here.  Personal preference, I know, and most Vegas goers love it, but it wasn't for us.

So while I am happy we checked it out, I wouldn't go back.  We left here and went to Act and had a MUCH better time, and the following night (Saturday) we went to Voodoo at the Rio and had a blast.  Just don't see what the big deal is with XS.",5,0,0

XS is located in the Encore hotel and the venue is just AMAZING. It's so spacious with a lot of tables and places to sit when your feet are dying from your heels. I've never been here during the summer, but the outdoor area has a pool and tons of cabanas.

With that said, there are insane crowds and massive swarms of people trying to get in--it's actually incredibly overwhelming.  One of my friends knew some of the promoters and luckily, after only 20 minutes of waiting, we got in (yes, 20 minutes is short!) for free!

After entering the doors and walking into the club, I was in complete awe.  XS is absolutely gorgeous and I actually wasn't sure if what I was seeing was real--I thought there was a mirror!  There's a semi-indoor area with 2 bars at either end and is lined with a ridiculous amount of tables all surrounding the large dance floor.  The outdoor area has beautiful cabanas and white couches around the circular pool, bar, and casino area.  There are also tables on an upper level for VIPs and bottle service.

The DJ had a habit of playing half a song by an artist that was mixed into another half of the same artist's hit songs.  That way, you never got tired of the music and yet you were able to enjoy more music by your fave artists!

As much as I wanted to give the place 5 stars, I couldn't because of the hordes of people!  The venue was definitely beyond capacity and when we were waiting to get into the club, the door guys were being paid off to let groups of people in.  That however, didn't include the price of getting into the club which is $30 for guys and $20 for girls.  Inside, it was impossible to get from the restroom to the bar without being elbowed in painful places and being sandwiched by smelly, sweaty and drunk people.

At one point we were getting ready to leave and this guy splashed his drink in a girl's face.  Two guys were face to face ready to fight and next thing you know--BAM!  One guy gets clocked in the face and the momentum from that punch literally pushes 10 people back, squishing my best friend into this platform area with poles.  Luckily, she wasn't hurt, but come ON now!

The drill sargeant in the restroom also provided for an interesting experience.  There's a nicer lady at the entrance that directs you where to go, she even says ""hi!"" and smiles at you.  But, the lady at the end of the stalls has an angry face on and yells ""NEXT!"" everytime a door swings open, even though you can SEE when a stall becomes available.  She makes the restroom a little uncomfortable because you hear ""NEXT!"" every 2 seconds and feel rushed to pee fast!

If it weren't so cold outside, I think the crowds would have been more evenly dispersed throughout the indoor and outdoor areas.  I would LOVE to come back to XS when the hype has died down...",2,3,2

I'd say that XS has the best night swim experience! During the summer time they have a night swim on Sundays. My most recent experience was to go see Skrillex on their opening night. They have giant floaties and the water is warm. The pool is good in size and it doesn't get over crowded from my last experience. Gotta go to these night swims! It's better than being in vegas hot weather for those beach clubs without any shade and getting sunburned if you have no bottle service. BOO for sunburns!

My more recent trip to XS, we had a table going into see RL Grimes. The crowd is always welcoming. I'd suggest if you want somewhere to sit to pick up bottle service.

I was in Vegas for my birthday a few weeks ago and rather than plead with bouncers\/promoters\/St. Peter at the door, the guys in my group decided to just skip the line and pay full price at the concierge - we figured since we were guests at the Wynn, we'd get a little break...


OUCH!! 

$65 per person! For those of us in the lower 99% of America, that's a trip to Disneyland, a quarter-tank of gas for the Hummer, and more than twice the money I could've saved had I switched to Geico (true story). It didn't take long for me to realize that the name above the door was really supposed to say: X$************* 


The Good news:

After we each took out small loans to pay our cover charge we went back up to the room so that the girls could put on war-paint and the guys could pre-game. We headed down to XS around 10 p.m. and there was already a line forming at the door. Luckily for us, there was absolutely no one in the prepaid line! in less than 5 minutes, our hands were stamped and we were walking right in through the ""XS"" letters at the front. No line, no hassle, no ""hand$hakes"" with the bouncers, and no wait. 10 minutes later, the girls in our group joined us and we all together before walking in.



XS was simply amazing. It was just like I had imagined it. The people were hot, the music was sick. There were lasers. The venue was spacious! Not once did I feel like I was on a rail-car to Mumbai. The DJ for the night was none other than Robbie Rivera - absolutely killed at XS that night - playing the kind of music that won't let you leave the dance floor. Based on the music and the venue, you won't find a better club than XS. 


Since Yelp is about ""Real People... Real Reviews"", I'll keep it short:

As you read all the other yelps, I will have to say everyone is pretty much right on, but why would I write my own because some people use YELP to get down to the bottom line. 

Here is the bottom line:

- Gals: you have it made and get all the breaks. 
- Guys: Prepare to get your balls busted with a higher than normal cover charge. Is it worth it...yes!

I recall a friend saying, I can't believe I just paid $50 to come to a club and then five minutes later he said, damn I feel like the ugliest person in here (he wasn't) but there is a lot of good looking people. 

The music goes in spans of time which feels like 30 minute sets of different genres (house, trance, hip hop, etc.)

Drinks are usually strong. I suggest trying the LA Water because it is like a grateful dead but different. If you haven't tried either....enjoy just not too many they get you drunk.

It's definitely THE hot spot in Vegas, with a gorgeous outdoor, beach club setting decked with cabana's and floating beds. XS has definitely upped the game in clubbing experiences in Vegas!
Here are some tips:
* The line to get into the club is understandably looooong, expect to stand around for a long time before getting in. OR go early (around 9PM), stand in a short line, get your stamp for re-entry, and then head out to the casino floor to play with Lady Luck and booze it up on the considerably cheaper drinks - or free, if you're playing at the tables. Head back to the club around 11PM and you'll be swiftly let in through the re-entry line.

* The bar inside on your right-hand side as you walk in tends to be the one with the least amount of people shoving. Outside can be a bit difficult to get served right away.

* Head out to the pools for more air and room to dance, because the dance floor can get so packed that you can barely move!

* Ladies, the best remedy to rest your hurting feet in those 6 inch heels is to head to the hot tubs in the back and soak your feet for a little while. Trust me, after a few minutes you'll be rejuvenated to dance the rest of the night away. Should you fall in, there's a bathroom to the left of the hot tub that's ideal for quickly running into a stall. How do I know this you ask? Yup *raises hand* I was THAT girl!! :-X I wasn't even drunk, I just naturally have bad balance. Especially on slippery hot tub steps, so becareful!!

Not sure how he pulled this off as the place was insanely packed and every other table looked full.  We had close to 15 guys and we were still able to get in for a 3 bottle minimum which isn't bad for Vegas standards.

XS is a sick club and definitely has to be one of the biggest in the world.  It's basically 2 clubs (a day club and a nightclub) combined into one.  Kaskade definitely killed it and the crowd was going crazy with girls stripping down to their bra and underwear and jumping into the pools toward the end of his set.

Let me first say that I totally understand the long lines whether you're with a promoter, table service, or regular ticket. Luckily we had a connection that got us in with NO LINE.

We walked straight out to the pool area and tried to find a spot close to the DJ booth because David Guetta was performing. We were able to find a place to sit with our feet in the pool right behind the dj booth. When David Guetta got on stage, a few girls jumped into the pool with their dresses on and a few guys did the same. After a while the pool had about 20-30 people inside of it with people splashing hard whenever the music picked up. It looked really fun except there was trash floating in the water after a while (cups, cigarettes, straws, napkins, bottles, etc) 

When people started to get rowdy inside the pool, i just stood next to the pool on the ledge and continued to enjoy the show. It was such an experience and I would love to do it again!

The DJ is between an inside dance floor and an outside pool area -- truly making it the best of both worlds. I recently came back to XS recently and I noticed many improvements so I decided it was time to update my review. 

A special shout out to my promoter Edward (ig: modern_edd) who put me on the guest list for Friday night with Diplo. Since we were all girls, we were able to get quite an express entrance, entering before most of the people who bought general admission tickets. 

We entered from the pool area and the view was stunning. There was lights across the top from the sides leading to the central bar area that even has casino tables now. There was also the addition of seating areas for the girls to sit around on. Security was also more relaxed because before they would yell at you to get up and move if you are sitting around a non table-service area. This definitely makes XS a more friendly place for the ladies to come, dance and rest a bit cause high heels are painful. My friend and I were lucky to come in while it was not too busy yet so we took plenty of pictures with the bar area, pool and lights in the background. It was beautiful.

While hanging by the bar area we received some drinks. My friend had the Long Beach ($20) which is a Long Island with a splash of cranberry juice instead of a splash of coke cause pink drinks are better looking than brown drinks and I had an Adios ($20) my go-to blue drink that is also lovely in pictures. 

After some light chit chat we finished out drinks and entered the main dance floor inside. My rule is to go deep enough into the dance floor that you are not near the entrance. If you stay by the entrance, all of the people trying to go in and out will push through you. My girl and I found a great spot and it was all positive vibes and fist bumps from there. 

Once it got hot and stuffy inside, we went back outside for some fresh air. I love having the option to go in and out as I please and I truly feel like that is one of the best things about XS that has it maintaining its' reputation as one of the top clubs in Vegas even as other clubs like Marquee and Tao has slipped the test of time.

The lines maybe long, but XS is pretty efficient at keeping the line moving fairly quickly (and this is in comparison to hours of waiting. You'll get in for sure to bust a move. Some places feel like a complete long shot in getting in). Afrojack occasionally guest DJs. So I only go when I can get myself inside to see Afrojack.

They used to play ALOT of top 40 hits, and you could frequently find those high rollers throwing money in the sky (I managed to grab a few bills, like $15 worth). If you're down for Tiesto, who is a resident DJ here, definitely come by. If you're good at the shuffle. Definitely stop by here for a night full of shuffling.

Sometimes they open the poolside depending on how busy it is. 

The bouncers here are lenient and friendly. If you're down to get in quickly and cut the line, expect yourself to be slipping a few extra dollars to the bouncer to cut through (on top of the $30 entrance fee for non locals).

Drink prices? It's a good $12 for a shot of patron here, and $8 for your cheapest cocktail mixer (I mean a small hint of bottom shelf vodka and a WHOLE LOT of cranberry). So if I were you, I'd pre-drink before I get there, and just buy one cheap cocktail to hold around for the rest of the evening if you're on a budget (ain't no shame in that if you're trying to save some cash!).

The only other downside besides the DJ is that there is absolutely nowhere to sit unless you pay for a table, but that's when you make friends :).",0,0,0

XS should promote this more and more clubs should consider having a night pool party! So much fun without all the sweaty atmosphere that you'd normally find in a club!

Came Sunday night (during EDC Weekend) for Manufactured Superstars and a good time. Got to XS at about midnight and there was a line wrapping towards the hotel convention center... XS doesn't have a separate pre-paid\/hotel guest line like at TAO that helps your surpass everyone in general admission, but if you're nice to the bouncers\/management, they'll let you skip the line.

Inside, there's a lil bit for everyone!
1) blackjack and crap tables next to the bar (play a bit for free drinks if you don't wanna pay ~$13 for a drink at the bar)
2) go-go dancers on the bar and around the pool
3) a dance floor (in and out of water) set-up in front of the DJ's table opposite the bar. 
4) a large pool with beach balls, pool noodles, and tubes for a good time

There are life guards on duty to keep things safe and towels available on site. Come in your bathing suit and have fun playing\/dancing to good music in the pool. XS Sundays is definitely one my new found favorites, looking forward to coming back!",2,2,2

Super sexy dancers next to the stage in these sweet bedazzled bras. Loved it. Awesome dance music(before Skrillex and obviously after), great atmosphere, sexy people all over, good drinks\/drink service.

Dont get me wrong, the club location and setting is incredible.
The music is great. went for Avicii, who was on point.
I had a table that was incredible, with great service.
Great atmosphere for most of the night.

Then, they packed in way too many people. And when I say too many I dont mean ""ew, look at those annoying people"". I mean: ""we have to get off the dance floor before we get crushed"". It was full to a dangerous level with people shoving and screaming and trying to get away.

Ive been to clubs around the world and have never felt in danger of getting trampled until that night. Never thought it would happen in vegas of all places. Apparently its a typical thing at XS on busy nights, so do yourself a favor and stay away. Go to any other big name club where you wont feel like a sardine.",1,0,1

I can't agree with them more!  XS is absolutely breathtaking!  The club itself is a decent size, but not huge!  What makes this place seem so large is the outside pool\/patio area.  Without that area, this club would just be a typical size club in Vegas. 

Like any club in Vegas, the drinks are expensive (about $15 a drink), the bartendars are hot, the crowd is your typical Vegas crowd filled with tourists, hookers and horny men!  What I like most about this club is that there was so much room to walk around this place...basically because of the outdoor patio area.  The music is so so in my opinion though.  The DJ's was playing about 95% mash ups, mostly fast uptempo beats ranging from house, dance remixes, rock, electro house, mixed in with some hip hop & R&B, but no original versions.  Pretty much every song he played was a mash up or remix.  Mash ups are cool, but its nice to listen to the original versions too which was pretty much non existant that night I was there, which was on a Friday night.  I know Vegas is big on Mash Ups, but good lord!  Too much!

We were told its near impossible to get into this club.  We arrived at the club at 10:45PM on a Friday and we got in within 20 minutes in the general admission line (mixed guys and girls in our group).  Our friends had bottle service so we joined their table when we got in which was nice.  

Some useful advice: If you want to buy drinks, DO NOT buy drinks outside at the bars near the black jack tables.  (Yes, they have high limit black jack tables outside too that you can gamble at during the night!)  The bartendars out there are VERY slow and I mean SLOW!  You're better off buying your drinks at any of the other bars inside or outside just as you walk out onto the patio. Just keep away from the bartendars in a giant gazebo near the black jack tables.

Second word of advice, watch where you're walking if you are outside in the patio area.  I saw three different people either step in the pool accidentally with their shoes on (both feet), or even fall into the pull.  Drinking, a dark environment and swimming pools do not mix well!   

Finally, not sure what this place would be like on a cold night since most people would probably want to stay inside.  But if you plan on going on a warm summer night, I'm sure you'll have plenty of room to dance and walk around.   The sound system pumps loud even outside!!  I used to be a huge Tryst fan, but now I'm a big fan of XS.",2,1,1

One is that if you're on even a slight budget, take the opportunity to pre-game....I don't care what anyone says, economically suiting up for a night out is never overrated. The second is you travel with someone who knows someone who knows someone. One of those someones is bound to get you the hook-up and in our case it was my best friend's father's Vegas hostess. 11:00 rolled around, we were dressed to the nines and ushered straight to the front of the line passing up the long string of hopefuls looking to get in courtesy of the downtown party promoters with nothing but a wink and a smile from the bouncers. 

Upon entering, you are taken to another realm of unreality, how is it possible that this place is a part of this hotel? The club feels like an ultra-swank, uber-modern version of a 1920s late-night spot where the social superiors are set above those down below of lesser known status. Here, the plush VIP couches and tables are set in height from high to low looking down on a crowded bump and grind fest. The decor is stunning with uplit color drenched walls, golden columns, windows adorned with rich velvet curtains, and huge beautiful chandeliers. 

Mind you, we were here in late November so none of the chaos of pool shenanigans and outdoor beds were going on, but there was one mystery dancer on the outdoor bar quite possibly freezing her poor little nips off. 

Drinks were on the expensive side even for Vegas standards, but between my friends treating me for my birthday and what seemed like limitless shots making the rounds from the hostess, I had no complaints.

There's so much going on here that you never get bored. If you get tired from dancing you can chill at the pool, if you want you can go on the island gamble a little.

I walked in here on Saturday night thinking oh god...another hyped up club...whatever. But when I got in and went up the stairs, the view was seriously breath taking.

I've never seen SO many people in a club...and well SO many people wait outside a club. As I walked in..the line was seriously 1 mile long. Lucky I even got in there (but that's another story).  I guess it really depends on the night you go, but I'll let you know right now..GO EARLY to make sure you get in.  
In that line 1 mile long, I saw beautiful women, suited men and still having no luck.  As I walked towards the entrance I talked to a few groups of females coming towards me telling me they had no luck...So heed my advice. Go early or get a table because on a Saturday night...that's the only way you're getting in.


What I really liked was the decor and the vibe.  You can just tell everyone in there was having a good time, everyone was looking their best and since it was out doors and in doors, you get the best of both worlds.

I really do believe that it's one the most aesthetically pleasing clubs I've ever been in (and I've clubbed in LA, Korea, China, Singapore, Taiwan so far). It's so big, has an outdoor area (that I've only discovered this past weekend), and is just straight up bumpin` on Friday nights. 

The music is really good here. DJs can definitely read the crowd, and there are lot of big names that come to DJ\/perform here. When I was here in January, Bobby Brackins had a performance of his one-hit-wonder (143 I love you). It was pretty fun :]

However, since it is so popular, it gets really crowded and it's easy to lose your friends, so always have a fully-charged phone and unlimited text plan. I know that girls can usually get in free, so if you and your friends have a plan to get in through a promoter, stick to it! Don't be like me and get stranded, have to pay cover, and just be miserable :[

So my 2 friends and I got pickpocketed while we were on the dance floor, losing all three of our phones, as well as my credit card, some cash that I had on me, and my driver's license. Now, mind you, all of my belongings were on me in a small zippered over-the-shoulder bag (ZIPPED SHUT). At about 1 am, I was on the dance floor and went to check for the time, when I realized that my bag was wide open and my phone was gone. My friends and I checked the dance floor (to the best of our ability) and the lost-and-found to no avail, but I told myself that there was nothing that I could do and that I must've been careless and left my bag open. WE DID NOT EXPECT that two hours later (while we were on the floor dancing again) that my friends' phones would go missing too, as well as the rest of my belongings in my purse (which had been unzipped AGAIN). At this point we realized that we were in fact the victims of pickpocket thieves that deliberately went into our bags and searched for items to sell\/use\/keep as their own. We were all distraught, and I had no money, no phone, and no identification at all. That was when we decided to leave the club (around 3-3:15 am) and realized that there were multiple girls that had gotten their phones and other items stolen from their purses. The security guards were calm and helpful (especially considering the multitude of crying girls they had on their hands) and we filed a security report as well as a police report the next day. I would strongly suggest that girls be extra cautious with their things, especially around a crowd of people. Next time I go, I will definitely be leaving my phone at home and keeping my credit card and license in my dress or something. 

With that being said, even with our things getting stolen, my friends and I collectively agree that it was the best night of our lives. We came the night that Martin Solveig DJed, and although we hadn't heard much about him, his music was AMAZING. It was a perfect mixture of Top 40 remixed into club beats that lets you feel the bass running through your body. The drinks were expensive, yet pretty strong (17 for a long island) and the crowd was very attractive. As many have said, the venue is HUGE, which allows for a lot of mingling but even when the dancefloor was super crowded, it didn't get the least bit hot and sweaty like it did at Hakkasan the night before. Try and get there a little before the club opens. Sounds lame, but you'll thank me when you won't be waiting hours in a ginormous line. Just mingle at the bar for the first hour or so if you're early. I'm sure you'll find someone attractive to talk to!

Coming from Boston nightlife, I honestly feel like nothing there will even come close to XS. It's actually a little depressing to think about having to go to smelly, sweaty bars again and having to dodge creepers left and right in the Bean. Womp.

ALSO (for the ladies): NO LINES FOR THE (CLEAN!!!!!!) BATHROOM. And there are plenty of lotions and perfumes to spritz on yourself if you are feeling a little nasty.

I really wish that we didn't get our stuff stolen. Not for the reason of having my old cellphone back and not having to cancel my credit card...but for the sole reason of us not having to leave early and abruptly. I will definitely be going back, but I will also be doing things a little differently.

PRICE
Always guestlist. I used to have to pay $20 to get in, but the last 2 times I got in for free. Yes, I am a chick and I go in with my group of gfs. (Funny how it seems like every time I wear heels, I pay. If I wear flats, I don't pay! hmmmmmm....)

MUSIC
Music is always good, though there was 1 time where I very much disliked the DJ. The guys seemed to love the DJ though. (Btw, I prefer Electro\/House\/Trance music.) Last trip, I went when Avicii was playing at XS (Sept 8) and it was amaaaazinggg!!!!

SPACE
LA clubs are tiny compared to Vegas clubs like XS. Indoor AND outdoor area with a nice pool. You're not allowed in the pool, so that's a bit of a bummer but not a dealbreaker. There's 2 poledancing stages indoors, so it's great for girls who want to show off their poledancing moves. The outdoor area is really nice with plenty of places to sit, relax, cooldown, and chill. In the summer I prefer to dance outdoors where it's cooler. In the winter when it's freezing, I'll go to the dancefloor that's indoors. Basically XS is the perfect club to go to in any season. They have a couple bars throughout the club, so you never have to wait long to order. They did close the club when AVICII was playing though, because when we finally got in cause of a super nice promoter, it was PACKED. So if you're planning on going to XS during a busy weekend, try to get into XS earlier.

PEOPLE
Always a good crowd. A well varied mix of all types of races. And of course enough Asians to make me happy haha. Can't really remember, and I could be completely wrong, but the girl to guy ratio seems to be 3:5

I was definitely out of place at XS in my leggings and tank top.  Seemed like EVERY DAMN GIRL was in the tiniest, tightest dress and tallest heels she could find.  Apparently, that's what you're supposed to do.  However, did I have fun here?  YEP!  My friend wanted to come both nights of the weekend and since I had never been before, I figured why not?  

It's definitely as huge as everyone says it is and as nice as everyone says it is and ridiculous as everyone says it is.  Whatever you've heard about this place is true.

Friday, we were able to get in no problem, no line (probably due to a mistake by a promoter).  It wasn't too crowded, but we did get there around 10.  The music was pretty good (and I don't like house, so that's saying something).  We ended up doing the ""find a table with a bunch of dudes"" thing and hung out with them all night, which was pretty fun. I even got into a dance battle with some Asian guys outside (who definitely knew what they were doing, I did not).  What the hell?
Saturday, we went for Calvin Harris, who was doing his thing after his VMA wins.  Holy shit.  It was way too crowded.  Couldn't even move inside, so we ended up outside.  By this point of the trip, I was tired and wanted to go home to my fiance and my dog.  My feet (even in flats) hurt from the night before.  Then, as we were outside, I saw a glorious sight: there was a hot tub and there were girls sitting around it, soaking their feet.  It was like Jesus, himself, had come down from heaven.  I definitely joined those smart ladies and spent about an hour with my feet in the hot tub.  
Eventually, I made my way back out to where my friend was talking with some guy from Queens (he was nice) and danced to Calvin Harris for a bit...in the pool with shoes off.  And then, we saw a guy jump in the pool and start dancing around in it.  Ended up leaving around 3am then had to wait in a 45 minute long cab line.  And then PEOPLE STARTING CUTTING THE LINE (I hope karma gets all of you, you know who you are).  That part definitely sucked.  Next time: I will walk somewhere else.  This time, though, my feet hurt. 

Anyway, this club is definitely a good time.  Even two days in a row.  Just make sure to bring comfortable shoes, patience and a high tolerance for alcohol.  Also, make sure you don't go day drinking and end up hungover before trying to go in here.  That would be a mistake.",0,2,0

Went there for July 4th, got in quick even with a line, got in for free and did not pay for one drink all night, I guess that's the perk going with a group of girls.  Next time in Vegas I will for sure be back to this club.  Thank you XS for making my 4th memorable....what I can remember.",2,1,2

4 girls, including myself came here on a Monday night and it was CROWDED. My name was under a promoter's name, therefore did not have to wait in line. We also got 3 free drink tickets for being under the promoter's list. 

When we walked in, it's was so prettyyy! However, as time passed, more and more people came in and became crowded. At that point, there was no place to sit or walk around.

We went to the bar (there's two) and claimed our free drinks (valid until 12AM) and was too loud to hear what the bartender said. We were not able to claim the drinks we wanted (don't know why), so she made my friends and I all sex on the beaches. 

As for the dance floor, IT IS TINY. People were shoving, spilling drinks and there was NO ROOM to move. (I understand it's a popular nightclub, but the dance floor was just too small.)

There was also a lot security throughout the nightclub, but they PUSH you if you are in the way! I totally understand if it gets crowded and people shouldn't block the way.. BUT COME ON... don't push us tiny girls in super high heels :( My friend was trying to get a drink and was not able to get one because of how crowded the bar was and the fact that I was ""In the way"" (according to security) while waiting for her.

Overall, beautiful venue and will be back to try out this nightclub again.",1,1,0

The event was sold out and the guestlist line was super long but luckily we arrived early enough to get in for free [: They just released their night swim event where the pool area is open outside of the club and the decor was just mind blowing.. This is definitely one of the best looking clubs I have ever been to! They had Manufactured Superstars spinning for the majority of the night before Deadmau5 arrived but I left before he began his session.. The Manufactured Superstars DJs were amazing but it was all house music so if you're not a fan of that then you will have a hard time dancing sober.. I am new to this genre of music so I stayed for a little while but never actually got into the swing of things.. The club was packed and you literally couldn't move much without hitting someone next to you, and there were many guests adorned with glowstick mouse ears in celebration of Deadmau5's performance..

We went the night that Skrillex was there, July 17th. HE WAS AWESOME! The people are friendly. The club is dressy and sexy. The pool area is inviting for swim wear. EVERYONE is in the pool! The vibe was everything!

Pros:

Pool with a Dj!
Dancing
Bar near pool and on the opposite side
Towels provided
Friendly people

Cons:

Once people get drunk.....
Cups in the pool
No where to store your purse or belongings
No such thing as no splashing....lol


Make sure to find a local promoter so that you can get on their list. Ladies can always get in free in Vegas. Just know someone who knows someone!

We got a table for a bachelorette party and I guess since it's all inclusive (bottle of vodka, champagne, tax and grat for $600) we were totally ignored all night after being placed in Suburbia on the other side of the pool. We were supposed to have a host text us but none ever did so I had no one to call when we were stuck in the table line forever. My friend has a broken foot and was on crutches so I thought it was ridiculous that they walked the most busy and ass backward way when taking us to the table. He was on his phone the whole time and didn't even wait for my friend to keep us. Obviously I didn't tip him. When we got to our table, there was a used condom on the ground next to it and it took an hour and me asking 3 different people to get it cleaned up. Service was crappy and people kept sitting on the arms of our couch. Security was non-existant which is weird because on the inside and the tables outside but still near the inside part, service and security is great. There was a bunch of people on e, including our neighbors to the left, so that got annoying. Then, the club was so over capacity that they wouldn't even let us inside or near the floor until 3AM. They just locked us outside. This place has just been going downhill since Hakkasan opened, the acts, the crowd, everything just seems to be getting worse which is a shame because I used to really like XS (see past review).

BTW... this is a review for MONDAY night only... I can only imagine how crazy packed it'd be on peak days. we were debating between this club and marquee (comso's new club) --decided to come here based on all the rave \/ hype. :)

xs is by far one of the slickest clubs i've been at in america. 
even on a monday night, the club is super packed with people. 
granted, they close off the pool area on monday... the whole area was impressive in it of itself. apparently on fri\/sat the bar area is extended to the pool area.

walls are lined in black and gold with female bodies carved into them.
gives you the illusion that everyone is dancing. around the perimeter are two large bars offset by tables.

$475 table service for a monday night... which my sister tells me is a good deal for a large group trying to get in and aren't on the vip list ($30\/guys, $20\/girls on mondays).


HUGE HUGE HUGE dance floor!!!  a major plus.
absolutely slamming dj 
clean!!! they have staff walking around making sure the place stays cleaned up. 
awesome screen with visual effects

--we were on the guestlist, so girls got in free but guys had to pay $20 each..but we all got complimentary drinks good for $20 at their bar so it all evened out. 

-- note...if you're on the guestlist... there is a separate entrance. you  line up near the ""swim"" store. lines form quickly... we got there at 10:30 and the line was already a bit long. 

one con.... the dancers weren't that impressive. it seemed like they were waving their arms in some random, uncoordinated fashion and gyrating once every 5 minutes. not too interesting. they also switch off quite frequently.

Let me start by telling you the story of how we got in.  I was here on Friday, the 9th of January.  Came here after the bf won big in Poker at the Wynn (We WIN at the Wynn!).  We met the coolest German couple while at the Poker tables, and the 4 of us, plus their friend, decided to continue the good times and check out the nightlife in the Club.  We had just come from Blush (before Poker), and we knew we needed something more hip and Vegas-like.

We walked over to where the Encore and Wynn meet and that is where you will find XS.  It was about 1am when we arrived.  The place was absolutely packed out front, and the lines were ridiculous.  With 3 guys and 2 girls, we knew our chances were stiff...  

So off goes the BF on his typical role...  He walked right up to the Manager and pulled his usual spiel - next thing I know the 5 of us are walking right in, in front of HUNDREDS of people.  When they ask us to pay, we were a little taken aback (hey, I thought courtesy was courtesy), but were quickly advised (LOUDLY) by the manager that he did us the courtesy already because chances were that the majority of the people we just walked by would even get in!  So we kept our mouths shut and paid the entrance.

This place is HUGE.  I have never seen a nightclub with soooo much space inside.  And the crazier part was that it was COMPLETELY packed!

It is nicely designed, with an indoor\/outdoor combination of space that really make this venue what it is.  The middle of the dance floor is in wide-open space, with nothing but the moon and stars above you.   The sides of the clubs are covered\/indoors.  The walls are decoratedly elaborately with gold figures of women's bodies that were tasteful and gorgeous.

The vibe and energy that this place carries with it is just amazing!  I have not seen such a hyped up crowd in a very long time.  Maybe at an event as large as Ultra was the last time I felt something of that nature.

The drinks were pretty reasonable, as compared to SoBe.  Nothing out of the ordinary in pricing.  The crowd is completely eclectic, with people from ALL OVER the world partying together in harmony in this one place.

The DJ was decent overall, but to be honest, I've heard better DJs.  But this didn't change my opinion of the place, nor did it affect the mood of the club.  Just a personal note...

Would love to see this place when the weather is warm, as there is a huge pool that apparently throws happenening pool parties over the summer!  :)

LOVED this place and would definitely LOVE to see something similar open in Miami.  :)",10,9,11

Great place. Half lounge, half club and there's music, so you can dance if you want. Totally not crowded on a Friday night at all either. What was really cool was going outside to their outdoor pool, with heated lamps outside...oh it was gorgeous.

No matter if you want to dance or just hang out with friends, XS is a cool place to be. The music was okay, but still a solid crowd of people as well (although it did seem there were a lot of college age people out? I got hit on by a 21 year old).

Yes, it is an expensive club, hard to get in discounted or comp'd, hard to get guestlists, and extremely expensive bottle service. However, is it worthwhile? Would you dish out a couple hundred for one night to receive their so called ""VIP"" service and avoid the long lines...

Well hey........ if you got the money, then it's not a problem... RIGHT??? ""It ain't trickin' if you got it"" If you know what that means :)

Cover for females was $20 and males were $50.... we made sure to get their early for general admission and we were prob one of the first 50 inside the club, our wait in line was only about 10 minutes or so. You pay the snobby cashiers and the bouncers allow you through the doors to ""paradise""

Haha) but all they did was attempt to apologize and asked me to call their security to file a report.  HAH. Thanks for nothing.  My review stands.  Wish I could give 0 stars. 

I absolutely HATE writing negative reviews as I'm more the type that if you have nothing nice to say, just don't say it.. but I've given the Wynn\/Encore time to email me back about this situation with NO communication back and I this needs to be known about their club for future guests because I wish I had known this before coming here.

First off, this club is BEAUTIFUL.  The pool, the inside area, the stage is awesome because you can see it from both the outside and inside venues.  This review has nothing to do with how beautiful the club is, though.

A bunch of friends and I visited XS in the beginning of March 2017 to see The Chainsmokers perform (which they were freaking AWESOME, btw), and we dropped over $2000 to get bottle service (hardly service... we poured ourselves more drinks than anything).  And yes, we knew going in that it would be expensive because it's Vegas and we were willing to pay it because we knew (thought) it would be worth it.  Little did we know that 2 of us would get our phones stolen that night, and there would be NO help or willingness to help whatsoever.  

We all decided to go onto the dance floor when The Chainsmokers came on set and the dance floor was packed.  You couldn't stand anywhere without touching your neighbor, but yes, expected.  I literally got my phone stolen out of my hand while trying to record them and my friend got her phone stolen out of her purse.  Another girl standing next to us also got her phone stolen and we later found her phone case without the phone on the ground when trying to scope the area just in case we had indeed dropped our phones.  When we realized that we all got our phones misplaced at the same time, we knew for sure something was up and there were people stealing phones.  We immediately went to a security guard, who brushed us off and sent us to another security guard, who then brushed us off as well and told us to come back \/ call at 6AM to see if it's at lost and found.  No care in the world that this was clearly a problem that night.  

My problem is this: XS is a beautiful club in a beautiful hotel.  My fiance's father and mother JUST stayed at the Wynn and our friends were staying at the Encore at the time of our stay and they raved about their service and how wonderful it was staying there.  But with this happening and the (non)service that we received, I'm pissed.  Again, we dropped over $2K that night and for TWO OF US to lose our phones worth over $800, I just can't believe it.

One more thing, when I went to get a new phone at The Apple Store at Fashion Show Mall the next day, 2 of their employees already knew that we got our phone stolen at XS before we could even tell them where we were.  We also found articles about it online.  Inside job, much?!  Just saying.",15,2,0

Seriously who wouldn't want to come here; good dance floor, nice areas to just lounge outside, good atmosphere. Its huge, and very easy to get seperated from your friends so just try to stick together. 
Both times i went it rained money, so that was cool, i picked up a couple bucks. 
The bars can get really crowded, but what club doesn't have a crowded bar? 
I love the outside area of the club, its really chill to just go there when you want to take a break from dancing. 
Our group left like at 3ish and there was still a line outside and the club closes at 4. If you're staying at encore\/wynn, go early get a stamp and then go back up to your room and pregame. Then just come back around 1130-12ish. Also be sure to get some passes for ladies and guys show your room card for a discount if you are staying at wynn\/encore. Some people don't like how there is trance\/house music played at xs, but its not like the whole time and seriously a lot of places mix in some trance\/house so its hard to really avoid that. Just go and have a fun time, it can get crowded but because its so huge, it doesn't seem as bad like at Tao back in the days.",0,0,0

The crowd there dresses very nice and great looking too! The bathrooms are always clean, lines move quickly! Great sizes mirrors in the bathroom also, for touch ups ladies! Last but not least, one very important reason why I loveeee this club, if you're outside by the pool area and you're not in the VIP sections, is all good cuz there's always a place to sit somewhere.

Right off the bat, the vibe is upbeat and people are lookin' good! You walk through the doors, up the stairs, and as soon as you you turn that corner, BAM! A vision like no other! It's breath taking and when I show my friends this club for the first time, I love the look on their faces when they see this view! You can either go straight to the dance floor or go either right or left to outside or a bar..  

Poles are scattered along the club for dancing and to top it off they have two platforms with poles. I am not going to say that I am in favor of those poles, but only in favor to see some females display the level of intoxication!! Hey, it's Vegas, what do you expect!?

Feel like gambling!? Don't worry, XS has it covered! Walk along the patio seating and along the pool where you will find another bar and a ""Party Pit' if you will.... One craps table and a couple blackjack tables as well! Of course, while actively gaming, your drinks are on the house!!

I celebrated my birthday here last year and got the best service! Huge table and they even brought me a birthday cake! What girl doesn't like firework-like candles on her birthday cake!? My girlfriends and I danced the night away and what was great was that there was security always watching us. In Vegas, there are always groups of girls that go to clubs and it was nice to have a big buff guy there to keep an eye out!

Music is loud and everywhere you look, people are having a great time! Staff is easy on the eyes and move as quickly as they can! The staff keeps this place clean as it is the most beautiful club in Vegas. I expect nothing less from a club located in a 5 star 5 diamond resort.

The music WAS great when I went here with my boyfriend a few times. However, my last visit with my friends on July 4th wasn't so great. The music was mostly trance\/techno by 12-1am. No wonder a bunch of people were leaving. Don't get me wrong, I do like trance\/techno, but I can't dance to it for long, because it doesn't feel ""danceable"" to me. I can't get into the flow, even though I'm so buzzed. I can dance nonstop to hiphop and house even when I'm sober. And the mixes felt inconsistent as well - they didn't flow that well. The DJ sucked - I couldn't believe that I could have such a bad time at XS just because of the music. The club felt empty by 1am, even though there was a huge line of people outside the club, waiting to get in.

The bars are still crowded as hell - best to just go outside and into the hotel, play some tables to get cheap drinks, or go to the bars and spend $5 less on mixed drinks.

There are places to sit, but it still gets crowded on holidays and special events. Make some friends with those who have table service - that's what we did during Spring Break.

Our wolf pack consisted of only 3 this time which is actually a great size in my opinion.  Three - four people is the best size for clubs because if you're going to do bottle service you don't get screwed on the pricing.  If you have a large group, I suggest not doing table service and paying as you go on drinks.

I have always visited Las Vegas the way almost everyone does and that's a Thursday - Sunday trip.  This time around we went Sunday - Wednesday.  Honestly, it makes no difference.  Vegas is a town where people come to party no matter what day of the week.  We checked the internets to see what night would be the best at XS and Monday seemed to be pretty popular.  Well we were in luck because Diplo was spinning that night.  It didn't even feel like we were at a nightclub, this was a full on EDM concert.  It was sick.  If you ever get a chance to see Diplo live, do not hesitate - this guy was amazing.

Quick run down on table location, and pricing.  Table location doesn't really make a difference at this place.  The tables are situated in a horse shoe shape around the DJ set, and it's stadium style.  So you step down 3 steps and there will be another horse shoe row of all tables.  Step down another 3 steps and you're on the dance floor.  Get the idea?  Price for the table and our liter of Maker's Mark was $600 or $200 per person (tax & tip included).  I recommend always paying up front and pay with cash.  Do not give them your credit card and keep it open...you'll get drunk and be tempted to get more drinks later on.

The chain of events: We hung around the table, befriended some Japanese tourists, drank our bottle, took pics and videos of people dancing on tables and falling off the tables, finished our bottle by 1AM, ditched our table for the dance floor which was literally the best part.  We were up by the barrier soaking up the sounds of Diplo.  Pretty sure this place stays open til 4AM - we were there until close.  A slow pocket does not exist at this place - it was non stop music, dancing, drinking, & partying.  Out of the 4 night clubs I have been to in Las Vegas (XS, Marquee, Tryst, & Tao), XS is my favorite.  If you have not been to XS, you need to go.

You can go to the Encore concierge desk during the day and purchase prepaid tickets to XS Nightclub. Although prepaid tickets can only be purchased by hotel guests, you can purchase up to 4 tickets which means that if you have friends who aren't staying at the Encore\/Wynn with you, you can still buy it for them since you can buy up to 4 tickets). There's a special line for hotel guests with prepaid tickets at the entrance of XS. We hardly had to wait on a Fri night at 11pm and basically bypassed everyone in the regular line.

Now about the nightclub itself. XS is beautifully designed and thought out with two main areas: indoor club and outdoor area. The outdoor area is basically where the Encore pool area is during the day and at night it's turned into the outdoor section of the nightclub, which makes it really nice to able to enjoy your drinks and the music right next to the pool. You can reserve a cabana if you want. They also have a few gambling tables in the outdoor area if you wish to try your luck while clubbing. The main dance floor is indoors which opens up to the outdoor area.

On Sunday nights, they have the Sunday Night Pool Party which means you can go clubbing with your swimwear. 

Most expensive nightclub ever built. Loved the concept and music. Beautiful people all around. Definitely worth checking it out.",5,0,2

I wasn't sure if I wanted to go or not because he hates clubs and dancing and I didn't want to spend a ton of money here if both us of us didn't have fun. I wanted to see the chainsmokers because we both like them, but they weren't there the weekend we were. We decided to go to the concierge at wynn to ask some questions, and she was very helpful. Originally I thought David Guetta was playing inside the club, but she told me he was outside which helped make my decision to go. ( I didn't want to pay money to see him and then be outside the whole time when he's inside. ) I googled videos on youtube and it looked like a really fun party so we decided to go. 

I'm really glad we went, we had a great time. This was the best part of my Vegas vacation and the most fun I have ever had at a club. My husband also had fun too, so I can make him go to clubs more often now, haha. It was probably because of the pool that we had a great time, I don't think we would have as much fun inside the club. I danced in the pool on the top step and was pretty close to the DJ. I liked the confetti, the laser lights, and the fog machines they had.

Want to know what XS looks like? Um, it's basically Tryst with more tables and stripper poles. Want to know what music they play? Um, crap. Want to know why people rate this place 5 stars? Because they're insane. Seriously, just because XS' marketing and PR departments have done a great job hyping this s*** hole up, does not make it five stars. Ok, so you went to the ""happenin' club"" that title does not mean the experience was five stars.

I got here at 9:38 PM yesterday (12\/13\/10) before they ever even had the ropes out to form lines. I was on the guest list so a bouncer comes up to me and says, ""Hey are you on the guest list."" ""Yeah I am."" ""Okay, well you need to wait up against the wall until we can get the lines formed."" YAWN. Starting at 10 we lined up. 5 minutes later, some guy comes up to my two friends and me and asks if we would be in his group because he bought bottle service and they weren't going to let their party in because he had 5 more guys than girls and they needed an even number. We said ok when he told us we wouldn't have to wait in line.

One word of advice, don't do strangers at a club any favors. Clubs are not the place to let your compassion, bleeding heart or decency shine through. 

We ended up having to wait until 10:38 with this fool and his table of TWENTY THREE f-ing people to get in while the gen. admission line was flying in. This guy who bought bottle service had the audacity to tell us we were going to have to pay $10 each to get in as a tip for the host. F THAT;  we're not even sitting at your table. We're doing you a favor. I was like, ""I'm not tipping a host and I'm not paying a penny to get in here since I'm already on the guest list (free admission.)"" I couldn't go wait in the other line because by that time it was 8 miles deep. 

Oh, word of advice. This isn't a freaking speakeasy, it's a corporate-owned club. There's no reason you should feel the need to bribe (tip) anybody just to get into the club on top of your entrance fee (if you have to pay a cover.) It's not exclusive and no paid employee is doing you any favors getting you into this high priced bar.

After getting our ID's checked 50 times, my friend Esther got out of line to talk to a bouncer about the f***ery we were experiencing and how we needed to get in right now. The second she was around the corner, amazing! The people at the front let us in. My friend Jen and I were frantically calling Esther when we were corralled inside only to be stopped by another bouncer to ID us and stamp our hands. I told the bouncer we had one more person coming (she was standing outside by that time) and he said she'd have to wait in line. I opened the door and started yelling her name and told her to come in. She was behind all the ropes and two bouncers were trying to get her to go to the back of the line when I yelled, ""She's coming in now and she's not waiting in line."" She lifted up the ropes and walked on through just as a bouncer was running up on her. The audacity of these bouncers is unreal.

We get in the club and it's horrible. Lame music, the pool is empty but there is some chick dancing across from us, past the balcony and empty pool, on top of the pool bar, by herself. Random. Very few people were in the club; funny since the lines were at a standstill outside. After 12- 15 minutes of this lame nonsense. My friends and I decided to head on over to JET, even though we weren't on any guest list. 

I will NEVER ever go back to XS. When Marquee opens up (for general admission,) this place will be a ghost town. XS needs to realize that bouncers are for keeping things under control, not a place to let their $10 an hour a**es let their God complexes run wild.",18,8,8

imo, the best part of the club is the outdoor area. you can give your tiring dancing feet a break (especially for you ladies with heels) by dipping them in the pool. there is also a little island that holds another bar and gambling tables. lady luck was on our side that night as everyone on our blackjack table kept winning and winning (and yes all this while being tipsy). our dealer was def. not in a happy mood haha :P

The bartenders were extremely attractive and super sweet and made really tasty drinks.  There was also a bar outside across the pool, which we had no problem getting drinks at, either.

The club was filled with beautiful men so it was nice to have some eye candy while dancing or walking around the pool.  Just be careful of the random grandpas on the dance floor.

I can not even begin to describe just how amazing this club turned out to be.  The moment we walked in, my mood to dance arose, and I immediately got a drink in my hand to fuel that mood...

Lets just say calling XS classy, is an understatement.  It is the mother of all the clubs I have seen in Vegas!  Its got four bars-- yes four-- Two inside, one near the pool, and one near the tables!  Depending on which bar you go to, the wait could be very veyr short... the music was great- the crowd was SO energetic!  

Usually the music at the clubs is average, but this one was very surprising-  the DJ was awesome!  And the crowd on the dance floor loved it!  

I will definitely make a trip back to the club, with my fingers crossed that I can actually get in again! :)

Worth the trip if you make it to Vegas and want to experience an amazing club!",0,0,0

Dancing on the dance floor isn't a death sentence since it's still a bit open and there's air flow. Kickin' it outside is my favorite because you can walk around, wade in the water and still be okay in your itty bitty dress because of the Las Vegas heat and your inebriated state. 

I love you, XS.",2,1,2

I always use a Promoter for this club! Definitely use a Promoter if you can, I recommend arriving early to the club, so around 9:30-10:30 pm, whenever your group is ready, so that you won't have to wait as long in line and hopefully not have to pay a cover charge. Normally its a 2 girl - 1 guy ratio but this weekend it was a 1 girl - 1 guy ratio which was awesome, since our group had the exact amount of girls to guys. Usually girls get like 1 or 2 free drink tickets too so definitely take advantage of that!

If you ever want to go inside the club (where the DJ will be playing) I highly recommend that you go inside before 12 am, because usually a bouncer will be guarding the entrance to the inside of the club afterwards. So normally my friends and I always meet inside of the club, rather than outside by the pools. 

My main concern is that I have had numerous friends' items, such as cell phones and money stolen from them while on the dance floor. So I highly recommend that you be extra attentive of your belongings and secure them in a safe spot, if anything make sure they are visible to you at all times.

Overall, although this is an excellent venue and a lot of great DJs perform here, everytime I hear XS, the first words that come to mind are, Ooooh so and so's stuff and so and so's stuff were stolen here. Hopefully that will change in the future. But just be sure to be extra careful of your belongings, sometimes we are having too much fun and creating too many wonderful memories that you just do not want to end the night on a low note! So definitely be extra cautious but also have fun at the same time, after all, you are in VEGAS!!",5,0,0

I've been coming to XS since it opened and it has never disappointed.  Just the sheer amount of space at XS is just awesome.  Half indoor and half outdoor with plenty of space for dancing and wandering.  And night-swims are my favorite!   We've had bottle service at the cabanas and on the floor and every time we've been met with excellent service and attentiveness - unlike other clubs (ahem Hakkasan).  If you are here with guys, I would just suggest getting a table or getting there at 9pm because otherwise, expect to pay $100 per person (guys) or stand in line for 2 hours.  Ladies, there's a high probability you will have to wait too, unless you come with a big group of girls dressed to the nines.  Security is also extremely strict here, so guys should expect to be patted down and scanned with a metal detector and ladies will have their bags checked and scanned as well.  Don't bring pills of any sort (i.e. Advil, tic tacs, or gum), it will be thrown out.    
 
Another thing I love about XS is that the headliner DJ always comes on relatively early (like 1am), so you're not standing there until 3am, drunk, trying to maintain composure, and keeping your spot.  Not pretty.

The service I received here was top notch. I ordered my usual drink at the bar, A Beautiful, and got it quick. Ordered 5 Beautifuls throughout the night and was having a blast. I go to the bathroom and was treated like a king. They turned on the water and put soap on my hands. They offer gum, tic tacs, toothbrush and toothpaste so you look and smell good for all the lovely ladies out in the dance floor. I couldn't help but tip them well for the excellent service!

How can I write a review without even stepping inside? Read on child...
Over a month ago I submitted and was approved for a ""guest list"" On Septemeber 5th. I was sent confirmation. A few days before, they said they are not offering for the holiday weekend, and the cover charge would go from $50 to $150 for two.
My idea was to get on the list (sorry cannot reserve a table and spend $3000 on drinks I can buy for $150 at a liqour store nextdoor) and they confirm via email, then they say no I'm assed out, its not valid.
This is just to wait in line and get in, mind you, nothing more.

I catch myself comparing any club with a pool, a fountain, or a waterfall to XS. Mainly because no one did decor better than they did. As far as decor, design, and beauty, XS takes the cake! 

ENTRANCE: As a local girl who goes out several times a week, ease of getting in is quite important. Usually, I'll go on a Sunday or Monday, their industry night. Walk-in is pretty quick and the list I'm on gets me 2 drink tickets. God knows a Crown & 7 tastes so much better when its free. 

NO GL ON WEEKENDS: XS doesn't need a guestlist on the weekends. They have a cult following of partiers. If my friends don't buy a table or my other friends who work here don't walk me in--I won't be found at XS on a Friday or Saturday. As a local, fighting lines is not my style. And weekends are pure madness here. MADNESS. On occasion, they'll close the pool area, and the main club inside gets too crowded for comfort.

MUSIC: XS took a page out of Surrender's book. I'm guessing the music directors had a meeting and decided to start sharing headliners contracts? Afrojack, Aoki, Wolfgang, Skrillex, Dada Life, the list goes on! If you're new to the EDM scene and jumped on the bandwagon in the past year, the XS line-up of artists will be right up your alley. HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE.

SERVICE: Bartenders are quick and get your drink right the first time. I haven't had any issues with credit cards charges here. If you're thinking tables, in my experience, the girls have been quite attentive.

XS is doing it right!

I only went here because my friend wanted to keep coming here. But next time, I know to avoid it.

1 night, I had 2 AMFs and felt nothing! these are roughly $17 each so huge waste!
another night, I had....OMG get this...1 AMF, a double shot of Jager, and another shot of Jager....This did hardly nothing....so I went to PH and had another drink at the bar.  The drinks here are a waste!  Don't even bother.

The music is good, if you like that EMDC..EMC...whatever! I on the other hand, feel you have to be a little tipsy to really enjoy it (or on something)...and the drinks don't give you the opportunity.

Apparently, a ton of guys here think its totally okay to touch you.  I didn't think it was cool and ended up pushing 2 guys off me-literally pushing them away.  This didn't happen anywhere else but here.  Also, in the times I went here, you get pushed around by these stupid EDM guys, almost elbowed in the face, feet stomped on...This all seems to be customary with this type of music---a lot of rude guys who think they need to push and shove in order to dance. No, it's not necessary, it's just really annoying and says a lot about your masculinity, or lack of.

Also, the trend here is to get your cell phone stolen.  So much, that they have the phone number for lost and found ready for you, if you ask for it. But when you call the number, the lady on the other line, gives you attitude and replies "" no we dont got it!"" before even looking. 

My phone wasn't stolen, but someone we were with was. Maybe it's cause I checked for my phone constantly. 

Another note, don't go to swim night..It smells of butt and armpits! So gross!  The smell alone, was reason to leave.  Sorry, I like my clubs where people wear deodorant.",6,5,0

Beautiful club..the layout makes the club very easy to get through and not impossible to find lost members of your drunken party.  Lots of tables and cabanas--right in the middle so you don't miss out on any of the action.  I hate when clubs put tables in darkened corners or only along the edges of the dance floor..what am I paying for?? (cough, Tao.)  
Music: Top 40s mash ups..wish they played a little more techno\/house but that's what Drai's after hours is for.
Be sure to take a good look around the club before getting smashed its well worth the proper gander.
Same routine as any other club..if you don't have a hook be sure to fork out the cash, tip your bartender WELL so you get stiffer drinks throughout the night, dress well, have more girls then guys..or no guys at all.  If you're a group of guys..dress sharp and get a table. Tip the guy at the door, blah blah..(I hate how people complain about this all the time.)
Crowd was pretty nice..but you can never get away from the not so classy, oh so douchebagy, or butter-faced bitches.  But you're here to have fun with your friends, so go do that so you can look back on forgotten yet memorable pictures at brunch the next day!

I wanted to get the whole Vegas experience for my birthday so I chose this club because it seemed like the best one reviewed on here in Vegas. We got there around 9:45 and there was a huge line to get in. Then once the doors opened at 10, the line was rather quick and we were in shortly. My friends and I had managed to see a promoter earlier in the day giving out passes to ladies for this club so we took them. He told us that the ladies would be free and the guys would get some sort of discount. Well, us ladies were free but the guys had to shell out $50 for cover. Drinks are also insane. $10 for beer and $12 for a mixed drink!  Ridiculous..but then again, it is Vegas and this is the number one club on the Strip right now so you gotta think about what you're getting. Other than that, the club was so extravagant and beautiful. I loved the whole layout. There were also plenty of places to sit down outside if you needed a rest. Some ladies were dipping their feet in the pool. There were sofas on the pool for people to sit on..and not just bottle service and there was even another area where you could go play blackjack or poker. The music was great..top 40 stuff that my friends and I enjoyed. Around 12ish, the place started getting super packed on the dance floor and we went on to our next destination on the strip.

There are 2 entrances to the place.  A bottle service, cabana entrance, hotel residence and the other one which is guest list and regular entrance.  The lineup is an amazing sight.  There are beautiful people everywhere.  You need to come dressed and with a smile.  Don't show up with your stupidly drunk friend as you will be sent home.

Visually you'll not step into many clubs in the world as beautiful as this place.  It has an indoor section with dance floor, tables, go go dancer...gorgeous go go dancers, poles for people to dance on and a nice bar.  There is an entrance to the outside which is even larger which has pools, a bar, a large open space and a cabana area which you can rent so that your friends can hang in and bring girls around to :)

There are beautiful people everywhere.  One of the things I noticed is that there is a pretty good mix of guys and gals which the staff does a good job of allowing in.

Drinks are expensive so you may want to opt for bottle service if you have a good number of people or money to burn.  If you get a cabana they come with a hot hostess and they're pretty damn cool.  You also never know who you'll run into at XS!!!

Someone say ""Casette"" instead of Cazzette? Yeah that's the kind of crowd you'll find here. 

Venue: Really beautiful in terms of the design of the club with many indoor\/outdoor bars. However if we're talking about venue space.......XS itself is big, but the indoor area is TINY compared to the giant outdoor pool area in the back. Especially that walkway they call the dance floor. I say this because there are only 2 tiny side doors to go outside, or you have to walk through the dance floor to exit. Not gonna happen let me tell you. And of course they pack as many people into the club as possible so every walkway has a giant traffic jam that will take you 15 mins to literally FIGHT your way through. Vegas clubs can never compare to IBIZA.  

Dance Floor: NO DANCING! I repeat, you will NOT be dancing. But you'll definitely be fighting with the drunk guy and\/or girl in front of you for pushing and shoving. I've seen way too many trashed people throw down on here. For example one time a guy knocked a girl's drink out of her hand and her boyfriend punched the other guy! All the drunk frat bros are literally shoulder-to-shoulder that they can't contain their testosterone. 

Outside: The pool area is actually really nice in the summer if you wanna get away from the dance floor. And this is probably the only area you can probably have a good time dancing. If you're here in the winter time, beware! Even with small heat lamps it'll still be deathly cold outside. I learned this the hard way. :( 

Crowd: XS definitely has more old people...late 30s to 40s and 50s (especially the guys) probably because they can afford the $75 cover charge and buy tables. Salt n peppa haired Sugar Daddies everywhere for you to choose from. 

Price: Overpriced, but it's Vegas what else do you expect.

Overall: I've had good and bad experiences. It all really depends if you're a part of the drunk people or not.",2,4,1

Pros:
1.  GORGEOUS club, best I have seen.  Indoor\/outdoor location and plenty of ventilation to stay cool when dancing.  No super sweaty moments and plenty of areas to cool off and talk (no screaming at the top of my lungs to talk to my friends).  
2.  Decent music, though the tempo needed to be faster, as it seemed to slow too much and interrupt the ""flow""
3.  Beautiful people!  Both guys and girls are dressed their best and lots of cute guys and girls.  Mixed crowd- even one old guy trying to grab some time with the bachelorettes.  Creepy, but a good ice breaker.
4.  Convenience for Wynn and Encore hotel guests.
5.  Location for 3AM drunk people sightings.  It's right near a cafe and a lounge, so you can park it nearby and witness some serious comedy watching drunk women on 5 inch heels.  

Cons: 
1.  Needed more security on the dance floor itself.  It is CROWDED on that dance floor with no designated pathways to get out to get to the bar or bathroom.  That means: pushing, shoving, tension, FIGHTS!!!  Witnessed a girl fight right next to me for that reason.  My husband was on the brink of a fight the entire time due to him hating being bumped into.  
2.  Sausage fest with guys way outnumbering the gals.  True, majority were easy on the eyes, but you'll never see their eyes b\/c they're busy checking out all the girls' bits and pieces, to the point of being eye raped.  Yuck.

- The female body outlines along the walls seems too sexualized. I like the idea and it looks artistic but I'm feeling like a strong feminist against it since they outlines boobs, nipples and all
- AMF costs $17 + $1 tip = $18 of blue diluted sugar water

Here's what I thought the pros were for XS:
+ Sexy people partying all in one place (except the nasty you-know-what that my friends and I met at the bar)

Most recent visit to this club was during the Mexican Independence weekend. OMG OMG it was ridiculously packed though.... inside & out!!! literally you could not walk anywhere or have your own air to breathe unless you had a cabana!

Arrived at the club around 11ish with a bunch of girls.  There were tons of people in line, but since there were so many of us, they let us skip the line and walked right in for $20\/head.

Since we were all pretty wasted already, our huge group tried to make our way to the outdoor pool area.  Well... Let's just say we lost half the girls going in because the place was PACKED!

The outdoor area is just gorgeous.  It's definitely better to be outdoor area where there's more space than being cramped like a sardine inside.  Yea... Dipping your tired feet in the pool is such a relieve too.

I love XS!",4,4,3

We went here because my group of friends really like this club and it is my favorite on the strip! Oh and of course because they had Steve Angelo playing on the night we went!

Just a little tip for the guys! Get your tickets ahead of time especially if they have some big name DJ spinning for the night! You'd probably pay more at the door! Lines at XS can get really long, but it ALWAYS moves fast! The dance floor can get really packed but XS is pretty spacious and there's always the outside area! There is a bar out there as well, so you don't have to squeeze your way through the bar indoors! 

The atmosphere outside is nice, and it's what sets this club apart from the others on the strip!

I was going to do something, but then I realized that he was 2 McDoubles short of 120 lbs. and had long hair, and my mommy told me to never hit a girl.  (And besides, Jesus wouldn't approve.)

What is it with white boys with yellow fever that they would think such a lame pick up line would work?  Do they think if I went up to a white girl and said, ""Hey, are you Caucasian?  Hello!  I know how to say 'Hello!' in English!"" said girl would grant me VIP access to her underpants?  

Idiots.

All that aside this is the best club I have ever been to.  There's not much I can add to what other people have said!  (Although I would recommend going early to get your hand stamped, then you can leave and come back later.)

The main dance floor that's in front of the pool near the entrance is now more packed than ever. The only time I was near that area was when I was walking into the club or walking out.
We hung out in the area past the pool, where the other main bar is near the tables. In this part of the club, it's always very spacious. The bottle service area had like a bed\/mattress. 
We pretty much claimed one of the floating bed kinda things on the pool. The gf & I took our shoes off and I rolled up my pants and chilled in the pool for quite a bit.

GET IN LINE BY 10 PM.

and you will have no problems.  really.  don't be dismayed by the long line already there.  i was with a group of about 10 guys and two girls (myself being one of the two) on a saturday, and we literally waited in line for no more than 20 minutes.  seriously, i kid you not.  AND for the regular price of $20\/head.  no hook-ups, no bottle service, no slip of a benjamin into the bouncers hand, no sleazy vegas slangers or taxi drivers, no boob flash.  if you're serious about getting in, just line up early and i promise you'll get in with no problems.

Very important tips: show up at 10pm-10:30pm. Expect to wait maybe 30 minutes to an hour even if the line is short and the club is empty. Don't get mad at doormen for intentionally holding up the line.  There are people of all shapes, sizes, and backgrounds in there who follow the dress code.
Don't act drunk while in line. 
The headliner DJ comes on around 2am, or 1am if he is early, even though the ticket says 10pm. 
Leaving and reentering is super easy! Get there early. Leave, get your hand stamped, and go gamble and do stuff. Reentry was instantaneous for us. Do the show up, leave, and return later move if you really want to see the DJ. If you just show up at 1am you can expect to wait for 2 hours unless you buy a couple bottles. Here is a recent tip report. 

We (guy and girl) went to see Martin Solveig on Friday August 15. We easily bought tickets online. We arrived at 10pm and there wasn't a long line. We got in around 10:30-10:45. We and other couples (parties of two) got let in early. Lots of groups of guys ahead of us had to wait longer. Tip: 1 Guy and 1 girl couples get in quickly to night clubs in Vegas. Maybe just as quickly as groups of girls get in. We kind of felt bad for the guys in front of us. It is HILARIOUS to observe groups of cool guys having loud and animated conversations, and then get super quiet when the doormen stroll by.

The online ticket instructions told me I must print up the tickets, bring the credit card, and bring ID. Research showed me that even if I did all of the above, I still might not get in or I will have to wait in line for 2 hours. I went there ""knowing"" there was a 50% chance we will give up on waiting in line, and perhaps face difficulties getting a refund. I was ok with just treating this as a gamble. 

I only brought my phone (no printed tickets) because I saw a different document saying we can bring the phone or printed ticket plus i didn't really feel like printing at home and I didn't feel like finding the business center at our hotel. 

When the door guy pulled the rope open for us (letting us cut maybe 40 people), I showed them the phone with my ticket. their scanner was broken, but they were happy to see an email confirmation to prove I purchased it. The ticket ladies were super friendly. The door guy was very classy. He asked us early if we were a party of two then we got in soon afterwords. No bribing involved but I recommend tipping them for being nice. 

There are like 3 lines to choose from. Reentry, reservation entry, and general admission. If you have tickets you still wait in general admission. 

Buying tickets online was like $40 cheaper. 

Also, I brought a piece of paper from the hotel to hold just so the doorman might notice I had some document so it seems like I have a ticket. Figured it might get us in faster. Holding a phone doesn't show ""ticket owner."" Not sure if this helped (pretty sure it did not help) but it definitely made me feel smart and cool, but also I planned to use it to fan myself if it was hot (Vegas AC is awesome!). 

The club is beautiful. The outdoor area is nice because you can hear the music but it isn't too loud, but there are cameras on the DJ booth showing the action on giant screens. Also it isn't hot outside. 

The bartenders are very nice. The blonde bartender in the right gave my date some free earplugs. The bartender ladies outside by the pool said they didn't have any to give (understandable). Giving earplugs was a really really cool move and I expected to see a $10 charge on my drink receipt (they were cool looking green and nicely packaged). It was free.",11,1,0

PROMOTER: Since XS has fallen a little from the clubbing scene, I figured it would be easy to get in for free with both guys and girls.  I texted Paul C (858-245-6055) and he said as long as I had twice as many girls than guys the guys would get in for free.  He was very informative keeping me updated with texts and making sure I knew where the entrance was (we entered through Brahms Ballroom) and even got the girls free drink tickets! We had 6 girls and 2 guys.

PARKING: If you're driving, park in the Encore self park lot, not the Wynn.  If you park in the Wynn self park lot you'll end up at Surrender, and have to walk across, past the check in and go all the way down until you see the Encore self park lot and the back entrance to XS.  I still do not know where Encore self park is because when I was driving down the strip all I saw was Wynn self park.

WAIT: The promoter said we had to get in by 11pm to get everyone for free.  I was a little worried about the line but we got to the back entrance at 10:45 and there was no line! We went in right away and got into the club.

ATMOSPHERE: People said it had an outdoor and indoor area but on a Friday night the pool was roped off so we could only dance on the inside area and then walk along the pool near the bottle service tables.  The inside was pretty nice, with a baseball shaped room.  There were rounded bottle service booths lining the side and then the dance floor coming into a V in the middle with on DJ.  Only one room, but it is semi-open so there was a lot of air flowing and it wasn't that sweaty! In fact, I didn't get hot at all.

DRINKS: They gave us free drink tickets (which don't work for certain drinks) but they were pretty good.  Water was FREE, which was great too.  

MUSIC: We saw Wolfgang Gartner play and he actually came on around 1am and was pretty good.  The DJ before him was pretty good too, but it's pretty much all EDM so if you're not into that you won't like it.  It wasn't super crowded so that was nice because you could actually dance and not get elbowed in the face.

We got in line at XS around 10 pm.  The line was fairly long but it moved pretty quickly... I would say we waited like 20 mins or so?  So yeah, get there early like other reviewers have mentioned.  As far as cover charges, I think the cover for guys is ridiculous.  $50???  Come on... I would have said, ""Later, I'm going for a big fat steak!""  So was it worth $70 per couple to get in... I think not.  Yeah, the club is big and the pool area is nice, but I don't think it's anything too lavish from the norm.  You pay for the atmosphere pretty much.

For 2 drinks and a bottle of Fiji water, it was $35...steep.  I now appreciate the prices in Houston.  The dance floor was fairly small as well.  People were jammed packed, and this was before midnight so I can't even imagine how packed it must have been later on. DJ was playing a weird mix of stuff...maybe old school house...who knows.

We were told, ""XS is beautiful and it is almost impossible to get in.  Even girls pay a cover.""  The five of us were totally up for the challenge.  So my girlfriends started working their magic.  We were connected with a good friend's, friend, ""Sebastian"" who took us through the VIP line at XS, and who got our cover waived.  We literally passed a general admission line that was hundreds of people long and a VIP line that was hundreds of people long.

Walking in, I realized it was worth it.  You go through a long hall and down some stairs into a massive space that opens up to the pool.  There are people everywhere, although because the space is so open, not appearing crowded or too hot.  There are girls (and a few guys) dancing on stripper poles to hot, hot, hot music.

Walking to the bar outside, was another fun experience.  There are tables lining the walkway and on the balcony room for more VIP\/Table service.  It was totally open... you're literally out at the pool area!  In the middle of the pool there is an area where there are tables where people are playing poker or blackjack with $25 minimums and a long bar.  How SMART to do this.

My three girlfriends and I met a promoter on the strip who promised to hook us up with his 'boy' at XS if we came to his event at JET. We said okay and exchanged information. We decided to text the XS promoter to see if it was legit and he told us if we could get there by 10:30, he would get us in VIP. Needless to say, we decided to ditch JET and head straight to XS.

We walked into the Encore (which was already mind blowing and just plain gorgeous) and then around the corner to find two extremely looooong lines to get into XS. We kept asking bouncers for our promoter and they directed us towards the end of the line. Our promoter was waiting for us at the ticket stand and we had to fill out a slip with our name and how many were in our party, walked right in past 300 people waiting. FOR FREE.

That alone was amazing, but once we stepped inside my jaw dropped. XS is everything my friends had hyped it up to be and so much more. You walk inside and the decor of the inside of the club is nice -- lots of VIP booths, a decent sized dance floor -- but it opens up into the glory that is the pool area. We decided to walk around a little bit since it was still kind of dead and my best friend and I decided to get a drink. 

We walked over to the pool bar area where they had also set up poker tables. Two vodka Redbulls (Skyy) ran us $30. We were expecting it to be expensive so we didn't mind forking over the cash.

By the time we returned to our party, we walked near the dance floor and made some nice conversation with a group of boys who were celebrating their friends birthday. By this point, the club is popping. The music is amazing (or my vodka induced stupor made it seem so) and they have GORGEOUS go-go dancers. They were toned and their faces were cute and I didn't mind that their butts were hanging out from underneath their skirts, nothing like the go-go dancers you sometimes get in LA clubs.

Some boys came up to us and danced with us -- danced, not grinded up on us like we were pieces of meat -- and invited us to join them at their table where they had ample bottles of Grey Goose. How could I turn that down? We ended up spending the rest of the night with a group of the nicest boys we have ever met and actually after XS closed, we went to go get a bite to eat together.

AND I have to say that all the people that were her were very good looking and also extremely friendly. I found myself on several occasions wandering off to make new friends. I even made friends with a fellow birthday girl in the bathroom!

All in all, XS is where dreams come true. The only negative thing I could possibly say about it is that it has now ruined me for any other club.",3,2,3

You are allowed to sit on the beds (first come first serve) that is on the edge of shallow water and you would see most of the girls take off our shoes and dance in the water without bouncers yelling and pulling everyone out etc like other places probably would've done. For ANY women wearing high heels....this is heaven!! The only downfall is DO NOT fall in or jump into the pool. Its already nice they allow people to sit on the beds (without additional charges, like many other clubs) and put your feet in water but if your IN your also going to be OUT! Sounds mean but I can totally understand its a safety and security issue. 

Inside the club can be extremely crowded so being able to be outdoors to socialize or catch a breath with the same type of music also playing nice and loud outside is definitely a place for me. So, I LOVE this place. Staff are extremely friendly and tries to help and accommodate. Unlike other places I have been at, there are absolutely no where to sit unless you buy a table\/bottle service. Pretty much a feel as if, ""no money, too bad...either you stand all day or you can leave so we can charge another person to take your space in the club"" kind of thing. Not here. Almost every club will be crowded no doubt but because this place has plenty of seating and space....you will always have a space to stand\/sit and breathe.

On the dance floor, I would constantly see bouncers doing their job directing traffic and other employees running to the dance floor trying to clean any wet areas, pick up bottles that were thrown there etc. Unlike another hot and popular venue I had went to, bottles would be everywhere and people would trip on the wet floors but with all the bodies rubbing against you in every corner, it will hold you up. No one would clean the dance floor. Why, because they would not have made there way in there as its WAY overcrowded. Which all you see is a herd on the dance floor and not the dirty floor with bottles anyway. Which tells you something. Safety issues and a total fire hazard.

So of other clubs I have went to, I LOVE this place and definitely a club of choice! Just talking about it,  I miss this place already!",0,0,0

I understand that you've been to XS every.single.time you've been to Vegas, but let's be real, how can you top XS?

Reasons to go to XS:
1. The finest ladies come here.
2. Super easy to get in.
3. No whack ass drink prices like at Surrender.
4. Beautiful plush venue with outdoor area so you can catch a breather.
5. Large dance area.
6. Hot Go-Go Hos
7. The best music
8. Racially diverse crowd
9. Nice staff

XS gets 2 stars for being such a spacious venue... unfortunately that is all they will get from the ninja. The experience with the staff let very little to be desired... The Ninja & footclan had confirmed several times with the club promoter that they were on the guestlist.. however.. when they showed up at XS to discover the promoter had failed... the guestlist guy & all of the other ""line monitors"" ( I don't know what else to call them) were very very stuck up, unhelpful & rude.

The Failed promoter kept dropping names (go to to this person and then will let u in blah blah) and although we had the names and found the people... NONE of them cared enough to confirm anything for us.

Standing less than 3ft away from us ones one of the guys we needed to speak with & we called his name several times to ask him for some direction and he ignored us.

This is extremely unfortunate bc I have  a number of Bachelor & Bachelorette parties coming up that I had wanted to direct to XS. After this experience that is not going to happen.

.::Overall::.

Bottom line XS guys will pick and choose who they want to let in... even if u were on the guestlist they will easily ignore you if they choose bc you can easily be replaced by the other 50 million ppl trying to get in. Which sucks bc the Ninja used to luv XS.  Good Music, spacious venue... but the staff.. it was just so so bad....

I've been here quite a few times already, and I gotta say, this place has always been the highlight of my Vegas trips. Not only is the decor and layout of the club amazing, but the entire vibe of the place just screams a good night. Get here early if you're looking to party here, because on crowded weekends, the line can stretch really far down the hotel. My friends and I bought pre-sale tickets to see Calvin Harris this past weekend, so we didn't have to wait in line. 

XS is a place where the ladies get dolled up to their finest and the gentlemen break out their dress shoes and freshly ironed dress shirts. The club boasts a pretty good-looking crowd and people are generally nice here. Watch out after 12AM because that's when people start getting uhhh..super friendly. But that's to be expected when there are 5 bars in all different corners of the nightclub. 

Music is just the best here. Calvin Harris was amazing and definitely made my night better. There's nothing like kicking off your heels, dipping your feet into the pool and dancing in the water along with other party people to some good EDM. Most of the night was a bit of a blur, although I vaguely recall my klutzy side coming out as the night got later. Note: If a guy asks you to dance, NEVER EVER challenge him to do the running man first, and then attempt to do better than him after he fails. You will trip and fall flat on your face, resulting in epic failure and bruised knees and egos. Le sigh. It's okay, I was forgiven though. 

Drinks are quite strong here, so at least they are worth their price. If I recall correctly, an average priced drink would be around $14-16. 

XS has been my first choice to party whenever I'm in Vegas and it remains so till this day. Bring your lovely lady friends, your man friends, and your cell phone to drunk text your best buddies from the club, while dancing underneath a clear night sky.",4,3,2

My suggestion? Gentlemen buy the presale tickets beforehand because when the popular DJ comes to spin the music, it will get crowded. So avoid the traffic in the guest list line and the chaotic pool area and buy the ticket and enjoy the crowd and venue before it gets too packed to even breath! Trust me this had happened to my guy friends!! 

It's a great venue. Summer time it is perfect to chill outside. During the winter, it will get very cold to stay outside even with the heating lamp above your head.

It made it way more difficult to get around and they closed off the pool area. 
I hope this doesn't happen all the time now! The last time I came here was about 2 years ago and then probably 3 years ago before that.

* Beautiful layout, spilling into the vast pool area 
* Awesome periodic trance\/techno\/house music on the dance floor 
* Droves of Asian eye candy 
* Huge cabanas and poolside couches available for table service 
* Poolside gaming and full bar 
* Plenty of free seating in the pool area along benches.
* A hot tub for my tired feet 
* A drinking fountain (This is very important. Usually you have to pay for bottled water in Vegas nightclubs, but because we were at the pool, they have them.)

I agree with other Yelpers on the extremely crowded bars. It made me want to double fist drinks because of the long waits. 

Best people watching moment: when the Asian girl's pump sandal fell off her foot into the hot tub and she fell in trying to retrieve it. Very amusing! 

The only downside was the confusing, long line winding around several hallways. I got there 15 minutes before it even opened and there was a line. A really, really, really long line. Luckily, I only waited an hour and a half to get in. Geez. However, in being part of the ""early"" crowd, once I got in, it was easy access to the dance floor and bars. At about 1AM, I couldn't move around anymore. There must have been 8000 people at the club.

For me, this was the biggest party I've ever been to. Despite the long lines, I loved it and can't wait to go back.

Came here Saturday of Labor Day weekend and this place was packed- 20 minute wait for drinks. Girls were charged $30 at the beginning of the night.

GIRLS! You can soak your feet in the spa outside (outside to the left oft he dance floor, look for the circular little pool). The water is HOT but saved me from super sore feet the next day. 

Music: Still house-ish and not hip hop... and it will probably never be Hip Hop. 

Atmosphere: Gorgeous... only club where there's such a large outside area with planters to sit and a pool area to dip your feet. You can also gamble and just people watch if you get tired of the dance floor.

Ok.. yes.. the lines are a bit long and the club is pretty enpensive. But hey.. Like I said, you get what you pay for. This is well worth it. The last time I came, we came for a bachelor party. Things got a bit out of hand, and we spent more than we should. But it was well worth it. 

We talked to the manager and we were able to get a center cabana in the middle of the floor along with bottle service. The weather was awesome and the outdoor temperture was just right. We got bottles after bottles of alcohol.. Our group was just having a blast. The bachelor had a great time and it was the highlight of our entire trip.

We bumped into a couple of my friends and a not so good experience happened to her in the club but fortunately they did have good security in place and they took good care of her. I was impressed on how well they have the place locked down even thou the place is pretty big. 

We had a blast and we felt safe the whole time. The crowd was pretty diverse and the music was pretty good. I highly recommend this place for all Vegas visitors who are looking to party hardy.

ARE YOU SERIOUS?? its freaking vegas, she's with a bunch of girls and who really says their correct weight on their id??  and what bouncer really looks at the id anyways.  ugh i hated the bouncers there, thought they were so tough cuz they were working for the it spot in vegas.

the music sucked!!!!!!  for being one of the most popular clubs in vegas, i thought they would have played more hip hop, less house\/trance.  it was like weird remixes if they did play hip hop, so no thanks!

okay ill give credit to how big this place is.  it was nice that it had a spacious outdoors and how they had gambling tables within the club.  i liked how it had a lot of seating area as well.  everyone kept on saying, it was the nicest pace, but honestly i think its only the nicest because its one of the newest clubs....give it like another year....",3,3,3

We recently went to Vegas for a bachelor party and booked with XS.   This was the smartest thing we could have done since there was a ridiculous line wrapping around the casino.  However, our boy Kenny (the promoter) took care of us and had us in a jiffy.  He had us seated in a little nook near one of the main bars, that overlooked the outdoor pool and right in front of a stripper pole.

I think this club is approximately 6600 square feet.  It has an indoor area with 2 major bars and a huge dance area.  It also has an outdoor area with lounge chairs and boothes everywhere surrounding the pool and the tables.  Yes, there are tables to gamble at!  Also, there was a top level for those who booked boothes up there as well.  This club was packed and it seemed like everyone and anyone I knew was at that club.  On this particular night, I ran into old friend, current friends and past acquaintances that I had no idea was gonna be there.

However, unless you plan on waiting in line hoping to get in, be ready to shell out the cash.  I went in a group of 10 guys and we paid to get in and then wound up getting about 7 liters of grey goose.",2,1,3

You can dance in the pool, the ladies were all over the couches and polls, no lines at the bars, huge dance floor, random people making it rain and throwing money everywhere, waitresses walking around with shots ready to purchase and take....the list goes on.

1.) It's MASSIVE! There are a lot of places to sit and and a lot of places to explore. You're immediately welcomed with a large pool in the center, surrounded by lounge chairs and ""beds."" The interior and dance floor is definitely a site to see. 

2.) You can always tell a club is legit based on their bathrooms. The women's bathroom has plenty of stalls, so waiting in a long line to go potty is out of the question. There are also a variety of hair sprays and perfumes lined up along the sinks for much needed feminine touch-ups. A bathroom attendant is also there to hand you paper towels after you're finished washing your hands.

3.) There is a very shallow part of the pool where you can stick your feet in. This feels amazing after a long night of walking, dancing, and shoecide. It's also a great way to avoid those preying man whores because many of them aren't willing to take their shoes and socks off to get into the pool.  

Keep in mind to get on the guestlist, arrive early, and have an even guy\/girl ratio, otherwise you're not only going to have to empty your wallet to get into this club, but you're also going to have to wait in a 3 hour line. XS is the kind of club that you'd see in a movie or maybe even in a good dream. If you're in Vegas and are looking for a place to get your mind blown, XS would be at the top of my list.",1,1,2

BFF and I parked ourselves near one of the outdoor bars and had a few 13.00 cocktails (YIKES- it IS Vegas, after all. We HAD been given two free drink tickets each, though). We later moved to one of the low retaining walls around the ""gardens."" We laughed, cried, shared our dirty secrets, all surrounded by a glittering, pulsing, garden of loveliness.

Even with stiff new competition popping up left & right, no other nightlife venue really seems to capture that ""only in Vegas"" vibe in the way that XS can. 

_____________

+ The venue itself is strikingly beautiful. There's gold hues, ambient lighting, & pulsing LEDs everywhere. For as photo-op friendly as it is, XS doesn't sacrifice practicality in the name of looking pretty; the club is surprisingly spacious. I also appreciate the abundant flow of fresh air; you don't get the trapped-in-a-cave sort of feeling found a la Hakkasan.

+ There's absolutely no shortage of ways to have fun at XS. We've done both general admission & the whole-nine-yards table service experience here before; both were equally memorable, which gives you an idea as to how well thought-out of a club this is. 

XS has a huge abundance of tables positioned both inside and outside of the club; we were fortunate enough to snag a table on the inside, positioned near the center dancefloor. The energy and acoustics inside this main dancefloor area are top-notch, although I will say that maneuvering around the dance floor is quite an uphill battle, especially during nights that feature A-list talent. 

And on that note - even the DJs themselves seem to recognize that there's something special about XS. We visited during EDC Week 2015 on a night when both Arty & Avicii performed; Arty played his trademark melodic house\/trance blend for about 2 hours, while Avicii kept the party rocking for close to 3 hours via a monstrous, thoughtful club set that I would've never expected to experience anywhere outside of Europe. We literally partied until the sun came up!

_____________

You don't have to spend a small fortune to have a good time here, however. 

Once the indoor part of the nightclub hits capacity, patrons who arrive later are basically required to congregate outside until space opens up inside the club (unless you've got table reservations!). Initially this proved a little frustrating for our group - until we realized that XS's poolside area offers a whole separate dimension for wild, nonstop partying.  

+ The club installed a towering new wall of LEDs & pyrotechnics that faces the pool\/outdoor area; the visuals blasting from this impressive piece of technology are all state-of-the-art, and it's quite cool to take a step back and watch the LED panels operate in sync with the colored lights positioned above the pool itself. You have to experience this setup for yourself; it looks every bit as expensive as it must have come out to be. 

+ The outdoor pool area also features multiple full-size bars with surprisingly short wait times; during our most recent visit, lines for drinks were virtually nonexistent - in spite of how packed the place was (for Avicii's final XS set!). The poolside area even features about a dozen card\/table games for those who are really feelin' it; we didn't partake during our visits, but on both occasions, we noticed that the tables were packed, and that those who were indulging looked like they were having a killer time.

____________

+ I've personally only been here twice, but the service at XS has always been a cut above the norm. Case in point - we're just about getting ready to leave the club during our most recent visit, and the girls in our group are beginning to really feel the burn from their heels. On a whim, my GF asks a bouncer if he could help us locate the nearest exit. 

In complete contrast to what I had been expecting, the bouncer radios in via his earpiece, and instructs to follow him. He made the crowd of clubgoers part like the Red Sea, escorting us single-file through the inside portion of the club to its front entrance\/exit. (Of course I got that brief adrenaline rush from catching envious glares from multiple angles as we were directed through the ocean of drunks!) 

+ After making sure that we were all accounted for at the club's front exit, this friendly bouncer smiled & wished us a ""good evening."" Of course, we gave him a bit of cash to thank him for his time...but this unexpected act of selflessness really stood out to me, especially in the ""me first"" sort of culture that's generally expected of Las Vegas nightclubs. Hats off to this gentleman for his kindness & generosity!

_____________

I can't say this enough - no nightclub out there really holds a candle to XS in terms of both the attention-to-detail and the overall level of service offered. Whenever I think ""night out in Vegas,"" XS will surely be the first place that comes to mind.",15,4,9

Back when it first opened years and years ago (this is when I start to feel old), it was the ""it"" club. It was fresh, fun, and my experiences were generally good. As the years passed by, my experiences started deteriorating and I noticed that the staff at the XS were becoming more and more unprofessional.

Ladies, if you are on the free guest list, go to the promotions line. Once you enter encore (where the taxi drops you off), go to your left. There are no clear signs anywhere so it can be very confusing at first. During my last experiences here, I have been given a lot of unnecessary attitude by the staff at the promotions line. I have also witnessed a lot of this attitude towards other girls, for no apparent reason at all! Please do not yell at us from across the room. It puts everyone in a bad mood. Also, the women handling the guest list were literally in T-shirts. I know it's not a huge deal, but when other clubs are stepping up their game and having their staff dress to impress, maybe XS should try to at least put in more effort.

Another thing to be peeved about: they don't let the guest list people have access to the inside of the club. Yes, seriously. I understand that you are trying to control the crowd, but you're only making the outside even more crowded. 

The three free drink tickets sound tempting, but if you have the option to...go to another club. I highly recommend Omnia.",12,3,6

We knew not to show up until 12 or 1, since another jock would before he comes on ( I have seen how this works before).

To say it was cluster crowded was a understatement, they only had 2 small bars to serve 2000 people, the only table and seating available was the VIP
tables which cost thousands with bottle service!! I always get the VIP bottle service at most bars, especially in Vegas. But with just the two of us, it's a little expensive and I'm not called ""One can Mary Ann"" for no reason, one drink and I'm drunk, and I usually only drink Ace of Spades or Dom champagne or only Grey Goose Vodka. At my age I only drink and eat the best, I deserve it and can easily afford it.

I was really disappointed that they didn't have any champagne just the cheap well drinks, so my daughter and I just hung out and danced on the stripper pole.

She even asked if she could show them her facebook page since this happened to her at club Tao and they let her through, but the bouncer said no.

The single star is for the club's aesthetics--as a premier Vegas nightclub, you expect a certain level of decor and XS did not disappoint. It has a large outdoor area with a pool, an inner section with the main dance floor (which you can see from the outer area), bars scattered everywhere, and many tables\/cabanas to reserve.

Now for the negative: 

It was a friggin maze trying to figure out where to actually enter the club. We had pre-purchased tickets online and went to the main entrance, and they sent us further down to a different entrance. We kept walking and walking until we essentially went in a circle around the Encore hotel before finally finding the entrance they wanted us to use and no one was helpful giving directions.

Next, the seating issue. Unless you dole out big bucks for a bottle service table, there is literally nowhere to sit once you're inside (so don't wear extremely high heels)! We were literally forced to sit on the edge of a planter where it was cramped and crowded because that was the only available place. 

Next, the drink prices. Ok, ok, it's Vegas and it's expensive, but I ordered a rum and coke and a vodka with pineapple juice for my friend and it was $38!!! Definitely milked that drink.

Finally, the actual show--which we had bought tickets for. The DJ booth is inside the inner area of the club which can have its own line to get into (so, yes...a line inside a line). We got there about 11 which was early so we had no problem getting into the inner area and ordering drinks. But with a couple hours to kill before the headliner and no seats, we went back to the outer area for a while. We noticed a line started forming to get back in the inner part so we got in it. The bouncer then let about 30 people in line inside and stopped the line with us about 10 people from the front. We thought we would get in soon after that but ended up stuck in that line for 2.5 hours (and never did get in)! The bouncer said they were at max capacity and kept pushing the time back: 60 more minutes, 90 more minutes, etc. So we just listened to the DJ from the line. Finally, at 1:10, the bouncer said the earliest we could get in  would be 2:30 so at that point we bailed. 

By the time we left, David Guetta hadn't showed and we learned later he never came because of the Billboard Music Awards the next day :(

The layout is similar to Tryst at the Wynn, but the ambiance is a bit different. Instead of the dark reds that proliferate the walls of Tryst, XS has softer, light gold and cool blue tones. Instead of a giant waterfall as the main centerpiece, there is a big pool on the outside patio. I also love that there are couches and beds available outside that are not restricted to those who ordered VIP bottle service. 

My main gripe about this club is the fact that local ladies have to pay a cover charge, contrary to how most clubs treat local women in Vegas. I didn't have to pay because we knew a VIP host, but if I had to - I wouldn't go to this club simply out of principle. The music could've been better also.

There is simply no comparison.  We went to XS for my birthday celebration, and from simple things like the ease of access, parking, our door contact guy got us in relatively quickly, and our table (even though it was outside and removed from the dance floor) was an absolute blast.

I will be back again for sure.  I don't know how anybody compares Hakkasan to this, btw...it's just not even close.

I'm in the service industry and have never seen someone treated as bad as my friend was treated. Completely manhandled by their gorilla of a security guard for zero reason. She had maybe a bit too much fun yes. But was respectful and agreeing to leave peacfully. Being the friend who was more in controll I am talking to their late night manager who was cool at first and then by the end of everything mocking my drunk friend as she's trying to leave to no avail. I'm sorry that your life is so pathetic that you feel the need to make others feel this poorly about themselves. We were made to leave without any of her Belongings. cellphone and wallet included and then she was screamed at to put on clothing they did not allow us to go find. I Had A Meeting with a manager of the hotel the following day ( because that's how I want to spend my vacation) and was apologized to up and down and he helped us find her things in lost and found. He basically promised me the world .... a bunch of comps through an email.... I am still waiting for a week later. While your establishment is beautiful you completely lack people with managerial and skills and they lack compassion as well. I changed my entire vacation for midnight swim last Sunday the 17 th. ... and was really looking forward to that night while I take responsibility for my drunk friend.... no one put a gun to your staffs head and told them to work customer service . This comming from a bartender in a night club herself. ....we work hospitality because we enjoy making people happy. Clearly no one at that club. Is there for that reason.

So the line is crazy long! but if you're nice and patient, no worries. No need for a guestlist. Just dont be crazy late. We got there around 10. Waited no more than 20 minutes. Paid only $20 to get in. They don't have a so-called ""guestlist"" for XS on weekends. So come prepared. Well worth the wait. 

Well first off, I was sober and ate it right on the steps! Can i say get me a shot after that?!

Decor is nice, place is packed, but not overly baring. The bartender, she was super nice! She gave me water. The shots here are generous as well. They are double shots pretty much and amazing! Love it already.

Yes Paris Hilton was there. Yeah?!... but the music was awesome, not so much top 40s completely, which was a nice mix. Thank you!

This too is near the pool, just not as much as Surrender. All sorts of people are here, a good mix. More foreign though, if thats the right word. :)..

Nevertheless, decor great, music nice, booze delish! crowd, youre okay. A place to definitely get your groove on! I say I would come back. 

I understand it being a so-called ""tourist"" trap. However, thats what vegas is overall! You can't get away, and you cant deny it. It is what it is.

Definitely check this place out if you're looking for a hot place to party it up! Beautiful people, dance floor, HUGE back outdoor area with a pool and cabanas... you name it this place has it!

I was here for the 3rd time this past weekend and let me tell you, it was not the most pleasant. It was at capacity x2! Plus I had arrived around 10 and waited for almost 45 minutes in line (you would think thats early in Vegas right?!)  I literally could not walk anywhere in this place, even getting to the restroom was a chore. I was saddened because my first 2 times here were awesome, memorable & fun. However, I do suggest you coming here and checking it out for yourself.... it's pretty damn awesome.

Beautiful decor, stiff drinks & everything you imagine a Vegas club too be. The whole guest list thing doesn't seem to apply here. I have been on one and not on one and have had to pay a cover each time. I feel somewhat ashamed since usually in Vegas girls don't have to pay. But I do recognize it's a business and I'd rather just be in there, then to make a big deal as too why I can't get in for free. So be prepared. Ohh and if they try to tell you they are giving you a ""deal"" by getting in for $20, it's bs.",2,1,2

We were on the list after meeting a promoter earlier in the day. Getting in at first was a bit annoying, because the bouncer legitimately thought my ID was fake for some reason. After my friends all got in and were waiting on me, he decided to walk down the hallway with it to see if the other bouncers had a blacklight. He came back and said ""i'm not buying it, looks fake to me."" ""Whatever you say, let me just pull out my passport,"" I replied. Dumbfounded, he let me right in. Lol.

Once we were in the second waiting area, we waited for about 30 mins before being let into the actual club. Once we were let into the doors, wow was the view AMAZING. A huge, luxurious pool surrounded by beautiful palm trees and decor was in front of us. Since it's winter, we headed into the indoor area with the crowd. Now THIS is what I call a top of the line nightclub. It's what I envisioned when I originally pictured clubbing in Vegas, only 10x better than my imagination. The lighting, dancefloor, tables & poles everywhere were so fierce. 

I didn't have the experience I wish I would've had while at XS, but it has nothing to with the club, just personal mistakes such as having drama with a friend, wearing EXTREMELY uncomfortable shoes, and not pregaming nearly enough. So basically, I wasn't in the best mood and was really struggling in my shoes. There were wall to wall people, which is really what I like to see and be surrounded by in a club atmosphere. But I will say it was annoying waiting literally at least 45 minutes to get a drink. Girls, i'm not telling you to wear flats, but don't make the mistake of wearing killer shoes to this club like I did. Standing in line really blew and I was in too much pain to even dance. The dancefloor looked like the best time ever. The DJ booth was lit up and everyone looked like they were having the time of their lives. I'm still giving this club 4 stars because the atmospher was TRULY top of the line. I really look forward to my next visit in Vegas because I now know what & what not to do.

The music was good, and the outside area is awesome filled with tables you could rent out for the night. I guess I should have done that and I'm sure this review would be a five star. Why is that? You have a server bringing you drinks, a place to dance, sit or even stand if you want. =)",3,1,0

How they choose to manage entry here was so strange that night.  Basically even if you're near the front of the line you won't be let in so easily.  If you know a promoter or tip one of the bouncers you'll get in a lot quicker.  I figured we all tip the bouncer $10 to get us in quick and had him on the line, a friend in the group said wait and in the end we paid $40 a head to get in anyway.  Didn't have a problem with paying this much since it was my first time checking out XS and had won some money anyway. 

After that, excitement starts to set in after walking through the side entrance to enter in with the awesome outdoor pool landscape.  Secondly, the awesome quality of the sound system which is smartly hidden into the architecture and landscape.  Probably cost them millions for this incredible acoustic setup.  Found out this place is like 40K sq. ft. which is probably the biggest club I've been to.  And yes they have a number of tables on the island area of the pool, which can be useful.  Just make sure you're gambling before you get your drink on.

The drinks aren't insanely expensive like I've heard they might be.  I remember buying like four shots of patron for like $53 including tip.  Dance floor area is cool but too tight with how many people are there.  Lounge areas are good and the pool view is sweet everywhere. Honestly, I can see why this place is the one of the best clubs in the US but supposedly it's losing its luster as newer Vegas clubs open up and compete.",5,2,1

Thank the lord my friend had some solid Vegas connections. From what I hear, it's hard enough to get into this club typically, but on Labor Day Weekend no less? Forget it. We arrived to a line filled with hopefuls that snaked out of the check-in area and down the long hallway. After some initial confusion, we found the VIP check-in located in a really random banquet hall section that backed up to the club. There was not one man in the line, which says it all about the nightlife scene in Vegas. Guys better have some really solid connections or drop mad dough if they want to party at the hot spots. 

The line moved quickly and we entered into the patio area. Drinks were crazy expensive, and although we had pregamed extensively, it was our last night of the trip so we wanted to go out big.

We walked around a bit then parked ourselves on the patio for a while, where we danced, people-watched and just enjoyed the night. Then we decided to head inside the club, where will.i.am was spinning. I must have been walking around with a glow because it just felt like people were extra friendly and having a great time.

Surprised to get an initial flat ""no"" response from the host Mike Glenn, I volunteered that I realize XS doesn't get the full ticket sale price, and I'd be happy to be credited whatever XS receives and eat the service fee or other cost-of-sale for XS.  And that he could scan the tickets when we purchase the bottle to make sure no one else would use them.

XS used to be my favorite club in the world. But recently they have implemented a new system where they combined the Presale Line with the General Admission line.

The girls not wanting bottle service were on a guest list and got in shortly after us (along with one of the guys who got a pre-paid ticket).  One of the other guys waited in the regular line for almost 2 hours.  Always a lot of Asian people.",2,0,0

I went here with my girlfriends to see David Guetta and had a blast. Beautiful nightclub and a lot of attractive people here ;). This club is pretty big, especially the outside area. I read somewhere this club was influenced by the curves of the human body... sounds kinda silly but once you see the club and the layout... it makes sense, lol.

Getting drinks from the bar was pretty easy, as the bar is big and bartenders are fast. If you go with a group of girls, find a promoter and score free drink tickets! My girlfriends and I were literally on the dancefloor for 3 hours straight, no joke! All sober, no bar or bathroom breaks! I couldn't believe time passed by that fast. The club had good air conditioning, which is important...it kept us going lol. 

As for leaving the club with a taxi, expect to wait a long time. We saw a huge line that pretty much crowded the entrance... seeing that we decided to walk back to the Cosmo which took us 20 minutes so we can grub on our 5AM pizza :)

There really isn't that much not to love. The grounds are large and sprawling, it's both indoor and out, and it's beautiful. Unlike traditional clubs where you pretty much have to pay for a table to get a seat, there are places everywhere to plop down and take rest or have a chat with other people. Drink lines are short and bathrooms are clean and fast.

Our night went off without a hitch. We had a fabulous time dancing the night (and morning) away. Skrillex killed it on the DJ stage, and by the end of the evening, our shoes were off and we were in the pool continuing the fun much more comfortably.

The security guards were nice too, took pictures of us and let us dance in the pool at the end of the night.

Because of late planning and it being Friday night, we had to pay $20 a person (I believe that's what it is for women and men have to pay $30?).  Also, drinks were pricey at $12-$14 for a shot and $16 for strong drinks like a Long Island or AMF.

So, why 5 stars?  Well, in short, this place was absolutely amazing!!  Soooo big and nice and pretty and awesome.  Lots of bars so you're not crammed at one trying to get a drink, lots of places to sit both inside and out, great poolside and a poolside bar you can walk up to, cool dance floor that is open to the outside so that if you need space, you could potentially just move closer to the outside.  Music that's loud but not too loud, crowd that's diverse and cool and well-dressed.

Bottom line: once you go, you get why people love this place.  And even though it's expensive, I loved it!  I could live here forever if they let me haha.",2,1,3

Okay, maybe not hated but if it was my birthday, it definitely wouldn't have been something I wanted to, drunk or sober, because I never really liked dancing. With the right amount of booze, that reluctance for the most part, levitates away with ease at XS, with the atmosphere, the music, and the personable ease at which we walked into the club. I felt comfortable and only paid $20 to get into the club, versus Haze, the other club that we went to in Vegas, which was $40. The crowd was pretty racially diverse as a different user pointed out, and for the fellas (or ladies) that are single and curious, the eye-candy is much better here than at Haze. 

The music for the most part, focuses on trance and house, with a little bit techno, remixing some popular songs from American top 40, as well as British top 40. I heard a few classic electronica songs as well, like Iio's Rapture, and Paul Oakenfold's Starry Eyed Surprise, so make sure that's your cup of tea before you enter the club. I don't know how hard it is to get into the club but I went with 9 girls, so there was not a problem. It seems some of the more negative reviews are just complaining about the music or a bad personal experience that was specific to that day.

I would write more about this place (and really want to) but honestly, I was just pretty damn drunk, having an amazing time, and thoroughly enjoying everything. Maybe that skews the review a little, but compared to experiences at Haze and Tao, this place deserves its five-star rating. I'll be heading back to Vegas for my birthday with my friends and this spot will definitely be one of the clubs that we'll be returning to.

OK, I know that one word reviews are frowned upon so I guess I will elaborate.  We came here to see Calvin Harris and the venue did not disappoint.  We are not Vegas rookies so we looked over our checklist...

1. More females than males in the group...Check!
2. More clothes on the 2 dudes than on all the females combined...Check!
3. Early arrival...Check!
4. More females than males in the group...yep, still a Check!!  
5. Pre-flights complete...Check
6. Group text of Hotel address and room number...Check 

Tickets in hand, we took to the club!  What an experience.  The music was amazing, the vibe was all energy and the scene was...EPIC!!!  Plenty of bars, the drinks were standard Vegas pricing...way too much for not much drink...the dance floor was small but the club is sooooo big when you include the pool area and the music is all around so you can party just about anywhere you want!!  

The only bad part of my experience was my fault...I broke a cardinal rule and allowed the ladies to do the group bathroom thing which left my hommie and I outside alone...they decided to stay in the club and as expected...when we tried to get in, the bouncer looked at the two of us and said...sorry, capacity crowd...then proceeded to let a group of 5 lone ladies in as he pushed us aside....errrrr!!!

So here is my experience on a busy saturday night:

1) Get in line boys. There are two large rooms off the corridor that they keep hundreds of people lined up like cattle, which in reality is unnecessary (More later). The waiting rooms are hot (temperature hot)  and the uninitiated have no idea how long the wait is because after zig zagging thru one room you think hey we are there , but no there is one other room to navigate..

2) The wait on a busy night is about 1 hr plus, such a buzz killer and makes you think why bother....yawn (Is it really that cool?). As you get to the second room in line, the bouncer offers quick entry for a big fee. Normal entry is 50 dollars for guys on Saturday, the bouncer will offer to let you skip this last room for a fee of 20 to 50 dollars. So if your willing to pay 100 dollars to get in then you can skip the last 30 to 45 mins of the line.

3) Now you wait and wait and get near the place we pay. The line comes to an almost grinding halt the closer you get, because all the hot girls or people on the list always take preference.   Now I am at the front of the line. I am looking at 4 ladies waiting to take my money but the bouncers or staff controlling the line keep us like cattle in line with a closed gate ??. I have my fifty dollars waiting, the women staff  are waiting to take my money but the bouncers have the gate closed. WTF. The reality is (THE WAIT IS ARTIFICIAL), and is made to make us pay early in the line to skip this miserable wait. Pretty stupid because if they really made an efficient process we would be spending money in the club on drinks in the club. The price to get in the club is $50 for guys , $20 for girls.

4) So now we get in and this last weekend was very busy in Vegas. The place is wall to wall people. Not enough room to just stand , let alone dance. So we go out to the pool area. Wow, again so busy its wall to wall to wall people. We get a drink, ha now four deep at the bar and another 20 minute wait to buy overpriced drinks. Last night a beer was $10 instead of $8 the week before. The price changes depending on demand (Unethical).

5) Hey, now after one and a half hrs we are in the club, with a drink in our hand. So we scan the ladies. Guys XS women are very variable, much depends on the night you go. In the week they have more Euro vacationers. Last night a high percentage of women were pretty sketchy (LA crowd) . Wow did we really pay all this money, wait all this time to find the place crazy busy with no where to relax, and  to find the women are much better looking in the street and in the hotel and hotel bars. Too many trashy people gives the club a bad vibe, and gave me the impression of why did I do this. I am a sucker coming here. Simply not worth the trouble.

So unless you a female that is hot and  you get in for free and get free drinks from the drooling guys my vote is forget it. Guys you can find better women in the street and hotel for free, without this stupid chaos of clubbing.

XS needs to be much more selective in who they let in and they need to stop trying to flees us with artificial long lines, with the incentive of frustrating us so we pay the bouncer to skip the line.

I have had good nights at XS, but last night was a complete rip.. Buyer beware..The club owners are just greedy, and have no care as to our experience. We are just objects with an ATM card.",8,3,2

XS is an incredible venue capable of an incredible party on any given night. They consistently book world class house\/techno DJs and promote very well. There was an abundance of space, different bars, dance areas and fun loving people. It would be pretty hard for someone to not have a good time here, honestly its a must visit if you can.

However, the problem with XS is that just about everyone knows about it's (deserved) reputation as an incredible venue. Due to it's popularity among locals and tourists, it can be incredibly difficult and pricey to get into. On the Saturday night I was there, they literally stopped letting people in around midnight and had a sign saying that guys would have to pay a $100 cover. Yes, you read that right gentlemen, $100 to get into a club if you are not on a guestlist...madness.

So, to save yourself the pain, please do your research on instagram or through your hotel's front desk to figure out a way to get on a guestlist and please please please arrive early. If your friends are lagging behind, then just leave them and go in on time and have a blast lol.",4,1,0

If you are a bartender there and youre not bitchy or slow than this doesnt apply to you. Im only talking about the 3 that I encountered. Twice it took almost 30 minutes to get a drink. Bouncers up front and outside are not bad, the ones inside were rude morons. If you bounce there and are not a rude moron than this doesnt apply to you. Im only referring to the few that I observed.

Been wanting to go out with my boyfriend and hit up some clubs, but have found that it cost men so much to enter clubs. So, I went online and searched for Promoters and found Chris!! I wasn't for sure if it was a real deal or not, but decided to sign us up to go to XS last Sunday night. Got to the club early to make sure we didn't have to wait in a very long line. We were the second couple into the VIP side! A total plus there. 

The guest list check-in was at a door that let you enter the pool area as soon as you were checked in. I loved that. The pool area was so pretty and so unreal. Since we were there and checked in at 10, we had our choice of any of the lounges on the edge of the pool. Yet another plus! My boyfriend and I didn't realize it was Sunday Swim Night, so I was dressed in a dress and he was in pants and shirt. Lucky for him, they have a swim shop to buy swimming clothes inside of the pool area. He bought himself a pair of trunks and enjoyed the water. 

Since we can early, there wasn't many people yet and the music wasn't over bearing. We enjoyed just sitting and soaking our feet in the pool. Another plus for this club was that I was able to dance all night long in the pool and not have to wear my heels and kill my feet. We were able to sit whenever we wanted, without having to pay for a table. 

Met some amazing new friends that night. Amazing DJ with some awesome mixes. Love, LOVE, LOVE this club and will definitely be coming back here. Next time I will take advantage of the Swim and wear a swimsuit. 

A few cons that I noticed (but it didn't take away from our 100% fun that night).

#1. They needed to have more people going around and gathering up the empty glasses. We shared our lounge with about 7-10 other people and the glasses really started to pile up. I had to get up several times and take beer cans and glasses to the bar myself. I didn't mind at all though.

#2. After a few hours here, it got super crowded in the outside pool area, so people were back to back pretty much. Again we didn't have a problem since we had a lounge and was able to keep it for us and our friends. With more people coming in and out of the water, the walk area around the pool got very slippery and I noticed that people were sliding all over the place. Once the confetti started to fly and fall on the wet areas, it was really inconvenient for some and was getting caught and mingled in their legs. Several times I had to stop dancing to untangle the confetti from around my legs. No biggy for me though. I do think that they could have been better at cleaning the confetti from the slippy floor areas. Someone could've been really hurt. 

Other then that, I had the best night here in Vegas so far!! I totally am in love with this club. Thanks for making our night so fun.",9,3,3

Not a fan of the music. They are good mixes but sometimes there are awkward moments where you dont really know what to do with yourself, like an extremely long build up to the good part of the song. You can only aimlessly fist pump for so long (jk, i dont fist pump, but you get the idea).

Setting:  5\/5

Looks amazing.  Very wide open.  Lots of space.  Pool was beautiful.  2 floors with what looks to be a large dance floor and stage.

atmosphere: 3.5\/5

This is almost a purely subjective category, but I'll say that it was a typical club atmosphere at vegas. Nothing amazing except everyone there has like XS-fever.  ""OMG, we're finally IN XS!"" ....""  XS is amazing!!! (after stepping through the door for 4 mins).""  Etc.. etc...  I guess because of that, the atmosphere will be pretty positive.  

people:4\/5

Lots of good looking guys and girls.  For some reason, and i'm guilty of this too, guys tend to wear more slacks and ties here then the other clubs.  Girls...just as scantily clad as other places.  I think this place may have less douche bags... but I could be wrong.

Crowd:  2\/5

At some point, there is something as TOO MUCH.  I'm surprised Vegas PD doesn't shut this place down because I know they're over packing this place.  I think another reviewer mentioned this.  i too went when Calvin Harris was guest DJing and that thing was ridiculous.  My friends told me they were getting elbowed left and right on the dance floor.  Security stopped letting people onto the floor at like 11:30.  You also have to wait in line for 35 mins in the on-call line and i think 2 hours in the general admissions.  Seriously, Encore needs to think about this and limit the number of people inside.  1 Fire = dozens injured and millions of dollars in lawsuits.

Service: 2\/5

My buddy waited 30 mins to get to the Bar and order his drink.  Not really XS fault, but when you go beyond capacity and have a short staff...you're going to piss some people off.  He mentioned it was almost $60 for 3 jack and cokes.

So for a place that is highly touted as being ""The Best in Vegas"" I was a little let down.  This could just have been an off night, so I'll go again because it is that d*mn pretty inside....but I'm definitely lowering expectations.

If you're coming to dance, like I was, go to XS on a non-sat\/non-event night.  Try Tryst at Wynn or V-Bar at Venetian.",2,0,0

It was nice being able to dip tired feet in the pool without bouncers coming at you.

Being Vegas, this place isn't cheap. But it's pretty fancy. I guess the price is a good thing, since people are all there to have a good time, dressed nice, and dropped good dough to get in. Unless somebody is on something, you probably won't encounter douchebags who will get confrontational over nothing.

The bouncer thought my state issued Louisiana drivers license was a fake, so I had to wait thirty minutes while he and two other bouncers pondered over it, decided it was a fake, and then gave it back to me and told me to leave.

Louisiana isn't known for its robust economy or bountiful resources, so our drivers licenses are lame and white and not nearly as impressive as a California ID or a federal passport. And personally, I, like most domestically traveling Americans, don't make a habit of bringing my passport to a nightclub, let alone on a weekend in vegas. So no, I didn't have an alternate form of ID to show the bouncer.

Maybe I should be flattered he thought I looked under 21 (I'm 25), but if that was the case, they should've kept the ID until I found a police officer to help me get it back. Or maybe they should take the time to study what other state IDs look like. You work in hospitality at a major nightclub in a town that depends on tourists.

Well, it'd be even better if it wasn't so hard to get into (long lines, hefty price tags for the fellas) but I think the difficulty of getting in makes it that much more exciting when you go.

It was President's Day weekend, so we thought it'd be super crowed & impossible to get in with a group of 9 boys & 4 girls, but through some good promoters, we were walked right in at 11:00pm, no waiting, boys $30, girls free.

Now, I've been to my fair share of clubs in Vegas, & nothing even compares to how beautiful this place is!  This might be a bold statement, but I'd have to say it's the nicest club I've ever been to. Because:

1. It's huge - no need to dance shoulder to shoulder with strangers & no need to fight the masses for a perfect spot on the dance floor. I think this place holds like, 10,000 people & you'd never even know it because there's so much space.

2. It's beautiful. Scratch that, it's gorgeous. 

3. There's ventilation - the outdoor pool area provides a nice breeze, so no sweaty armpits!

4. The music is good & there's no creepy old people (like, 50+ year olds, or that old long white bearded man in the Hawaiian shirt you always see at PURE.)

Well, clubs around the Bay Area at least; seems like in other cities (namely Vegas), they do better.  Although the clubbing atmosphere is similar (for the most part), I guess it's just the fact of being in Vegas that makes it different.  Then again, when you compare the venues, you can see why they're better.

While I hate going to clubs that have a cover of some sort, there's no avoiding it in Vegas (unless you're a girl).  At least XS makes it worth it.  My friends and I opted to get a couple of bottles and table service since it worked out to be a better value for us than paying for cover and for rounds at the bar.  Plus, hard to put a price on being able to pass up the majority of the lines as well. 

XS is just a gorgeous venue, especially when you're not dying in that stifling desert heat.  There's a relatively plush indoor section with a bunch of tables\/booths, the main bar area, and dance floor.  The venue opens onto the outdoor area by the pool, which is surrounded by tables (where we were at) and two levels of cabanas.  They have an outdoor bar that's closer to the dance floor section, while there's another on the other side of the pool.  There were some tables set-up too for any potential gamblers...and there were quite a few packing the tables.  Kinda surprising considering you can do that in the casino without paying cover, but maybe they were all just on a hot streak.

The DJ spinning the night we went was pretty good - mostly hip-hop\/top-40 with some house thrown to mix it up a bit.  The dance floor was pretty packed, and the crowd was pretty cool too.  Pretty diverse, and lots of pretty girls in nice dresses...a guy can't argue with that!  I would suggest trying to load up on drinks beforehand though.  Like at any other club on the strip, drinks can get pretty pricey...but just make sure you don't get too loaded before you get inside.

I seriously thought I'd get bored when we came back the second night in a row to see Avicii (after seeing phenomenal Zedd) but this time we arrived at 11 instead of 10 and the Saturday night crowd was already pumped. The bride to be in our group introduced me to EDM a few years ago and of course we had to see some famous DJ's during her bachelorette. I learned two things: I actually like Zedd more than I thought and Avicii's way mellow. Zedd blew away the crowd on 6\/26\/15-- he started out strong and weaved less intense songs throughout his set, ensuring we'd never get bored of the same things over and over again. In his defense, we only stayed for 15-20 min for Avicii's set (6\/27) due to our itinerary, but he could've wowed the crowd from the very beginning. I didn't want to leave until I heard ""I Want You to Know"" from Zedd but it was already 3am. At least he played ""Beautiful Now"" funny how the bride to be didn't catch that. 

XS is the most expensive club ever built, according to Vegas ads anyway, and the outdoor pool area is breathtaking with the newly added Parisian-like strung lights that weren't there last year. Bartenders are pretty and make good drinks even with our comp tickets. I must have had at least three S** on the beaches here! Each lady in our group received two comp drink tickets ($20 max the first night, $15 the second) because we were on guest list. Tip them a buck for their hard work. Fiji water's so expensive at $10 a bottle! But you've got to stay hydrated somehow ... eat the ice in your drink! 

This is the most relaxed club I've been to: I saw some girls wearing denim shorts and sandals. Look cute but be comfortable! Have fun and be polite! 

Diverse crowd here! Lots of eye candy and be prepared for an extra $35 cover if you want to dance inside when headlining DJ's are in the house. It was still free to party outside if on guest list. Get your drinks early to avoid the wait at any of the bars. I had no idea they had some casino games near the round bar in the center of the pool area.

we came on a Friday night and got in line around 930 cuz the club opened at 10.

cons:
- girls have to pay $20 cover, they only have guestlist for pool sundays and no free ladies passes anymore, guys $30
- can sometimes be more of a sausagefest than eye candy, and there were some random old dudes that were creepy
- dance floor doesn't get popping until midnite... then it gets too crowded.

(in between): drinks can be pricey but it's pricey at any vegas club. it also depends on your bartender. i got a redbull vodka for $12. my friend (a guy) got the same later for $15

now the pros:
+ the layout and colors are beautiful. you can sit on ledges inside the club. if you need some air, you can go outside... it's gorgeous with the pool setting, people are chatting and mingling. there's 2 bars outside that can be less crowded and tables to gamble at if you wish.
+ music was good. they played a mix of top 40, house\/energy, hip hop to cater to all types
+ the crowd is pretty chill too. even though, most are dressed up more than at other clubs (suits with ties), the people are here to have fun.. with others.

to summarize... you have fun in a beautiful place, with awesome people... and you don't have to be squished in a tiny venue *cough* TAO *cough*.

side note: i've been here on their pool sundays, and it's more like a nite time pool party than a club. half the people don't know they can swim in the pool, so they're just mingling and sitting around on the sides because the indoor area is closed off. not as fun.",0,0,0

On my recent trip to Vegas I had to go to XS since I didn't go last time. I searched high and low for a promoter or host to put my girls and I on a guestlist, but was kept on getting told that there is no guestlist for XS on Fri & Sat. Luckily i found a promoter for the Hard Rock that was able to walk us in at midnight. Shoutout to Michael you were awesome!

We finally met up with him and he walked us in through some secret way. Finally after getting stamped 3 times we were in. It was just amazing. We went by the pool first to rest our feet. We walked around for a bit, but didn't make it to the dancefloor. It was crazy packed. 

We did order 1 round of drinks and the bartender made a pretty weak drink. If you have the money for a table do it!

We later found out that our area had been given to Joakim Noah of the Bulls. We are getting some type of refund after contacting the manager, but if you spend thousands of dollars in a place, then you expect great service.

The dj mostly played pop and house music, and some top 40. About f5 or 6 hip hop songs were played. Also, the crowd isn't a very diverse one.  The beauty of the club and the overall environment makes up for what the club lacks in music,service, and crowd.",1,0,0

This pretty much defeats the purpose of going to XS for me. I had heard this rumor a bit ago, but I had done some research that had led me to believe it was just a nasty lie. However, I was there in person on Monday night, and there was that ugly velvet rope telling me I could not go lounge poolside. We asked a bouncer, and he said they only open it up on Fridays and Saturdays. I was upset for a good 15 minutes, but then I had the unexpected bonus of realizing that you can sit at tables until the people who may have reserved them arrive, at least at XS. Call me clueless, but I was not aware of this nightlife trivia.  

I was going to leave the star rating at 4, but when I think about it: I probably won't go back now that I know the pool experience is shut down on the weekdays. 

If you love typical Las Vegas clublife on Fridays and Saturdays, then this is probably still a 5 star experience for you, but if you are like me, and enjoyed taking advantage of the beautiful pool on an off night, our party has been ruined for the time being.",19,1,10

It's like Tryst only much bigger, with a huge pool and tons of private cabanas.

Saturday night: $20 girls, $30 guys, no line, got in at 10:30pm and stayed until 4am, dancing to awesome music.

That's how badass it was. I didn't even want to leave. If XS was open all day, I'd sleep there.

I will definitely be back if I ever go back to Vegas!

I will say this: WHERE ARE ALL THE PRETTY PEOPLE!? Not that many, a few hot boys and girls but definitely some janky looking people.

highlights:
- Seeing Chuck Liddel 3-way kiss 2 hoes; he also bit one of the girls booty.
- Nicky Hilton walking past me.
- Some 5'0"" guy trying to holler at me and my friend, but we ignored him so he said ""okay, definitely not THOSE girls."" to which I replied, ""and you're way too short.""
- Seeing my hot girlfriends dance on the ledges for free!

The quality of the music, peoples' willingness to dance and not care what anyone thinks, and the size of the dance floor are the most important things to me. If you want a review for someone who prioritizes these key points, keep reading. 

Atmosphere: Being a Vegas club, all the people here are dressed to impress. Girls look great and (most) are fine with coming down to the dance floor and showing what they got. Nothing too crazy (dancing wise), but they are willing to dance with pretty much anyone that is confident enough to approach them. Dance circles are not happening here (comments below about the floor size), but people channel the Vegas vibe of not caring about what anyone thinks when they dance.

XS has an amazing outdoor venue that pictures don't too justice. Nice to go out there after you have met new people and have a really conversation.

Dance Floor: Size of the dance floor is the one week point of XS. It's not the smallest I've seen, but barely gives enough room to dance around besides the standard fist pumping.

Price: Go with a promoter and prepare to pay a good amount of $$$ to get in if you're a guy (yay penis tax)! I've never done the normal line, but have paid a good amount to walk right in without waiting in line. Personally, I think it's worth it to make sure you get in and don't have to worry about waiting in line. 

Music Quality: XS brings only the top names in the Electronic music scene. I've seen both Porter Robinson and Martin Solveig live and their sets were some of the best I have ever seen, especially amplified by the AMAZING sound quality. XS has the best sound in a venue I have ever heard. Be it right in the front, in the back of the dance floor, or even outside near the pool, regardless of where you are at the club the music is not distorted in the slightest.

Overall Thoughts: Though lacking space to actually dance and a lack of people willing to participate in dance circles, XS is still my favorite club I have been to so far. People here are willing to get out of their comfort zone and have fun, which is key to making a club stand out among the crowd. If you're prepared to pay top dollar, XS is the one club in Vegas you can't miss.",1,1,2

The waitress we ordered our drinks from charged our cards multiple times each, and not to mention was extremely rude.  We did not find out about these transactions until later that night when we checked our bank accounts.  The club was overcrowded and I'm assuming our cards got mixed up at the bar.  We are in the process of making claims with our banks. 

The DJ we saw prior to Deadmau5 was horrible. He did not engage the crowd and his music selection was uninspired.

Overall, we felt completely ripped off and did not think the club was anything extra special. I wish our night had been better, but the Encore staff was unfriendly and rude  and the club was extremely overpacked. I've been to my fair share of EDM events and I felt this club was less than stellar. 

If anyone does visit the XS, my advice would be to bring cash for drinks since they obviously are not very organized and unconcerned about their guests.",1,0,0

Between his set it was a clear indication that nobody on the floor was dancing and after Diplo had came on there was a huge shift in the excitement of the crowd. Some of my most fun nights here have been with RL Grime. 

I respect those who like Virgil's music, but it seems more mainstream than when he played in Brooklyn (which was great!). It just felt like he wasn't reading the crowd here at XS.

7. Club is getting lame so you decide to go gamble.

7. Walk back to your hotel room barefoot.

XS is nice & VERY big. Half indoors...half outdoors by the pool. Yes...you can dance in the pools! So ladies...take off those killer heels and soak your feet!

We had a great table on the inside of the club facing directly towards Diplo.  The club was packed, the energy was great, the ambiance of the club was great.  Truly what you imagine when you think about nightlife in Vegas.

The problem I had was around 2:00 am in the morning, I took a moment to step outside near the pool and get some fresh air.  When I tried to return to our table, the security guard said the inside was too crowded and that we would have to wait in line to get back in.  I told the security guard that I had a table on the inside and he told me that didn't make a difference and that I would have to wait to get back in.

So I got into the line to get back in and figured I would wait 5-10 minutes.  Plenty of people were leaving the inner area but the guards were not letting any people back in.  I waited in the line for a total of 45 minutes before I gave up and left the club.  I never got back to my table.  I never got to hear the best part of Diplo's set.

I came here new year's night and was very impressed with the service I received. First the door guys aren't major asses like at other clubs in Vegas (I'm talking to those at The Bank in the Bellagio and Pure). I came with the bro and no girls, so normally two single guys would be out of luck to come into such a hot club in Vegas without bottle service. Not here, where we greased the right door guy into letting us in for a nominal fee of $80 each. Again, not cheap, but way cheaper and easier than waiting in line or getting bottle service. 
But the great service of the door guy didn't help with the girl-guy ratio, which every vegas club should try to keep to 50-50. From what I could see, it was more 65-35 guy\/girl ratio. This really sucked for me. As a single guy who isn't rude or aggressive in approaching women at clubs, it was damn near impossible to go up to a girl here without coming off like an ass or disrespecting the union of an attached woman. 
The dancefloor is big, but that didn't stop it from being sardine packed. The outside, while large in it's own right and great for more dancing, was cold. So this works well for summer, but not winter.
There was a great mix of hip hop, rap, techno, and pop, but the dj seriously needed to stop saying ""2010"" every 10 mins or so. I liked the rotating set of go go dancers, and the placement of poles near the tables, giving girls the opportunity to show their stuff for the whole club to see. One girl did some crazy gymnastic like moves at one of the poles, catching the attention of all those surrounding her.

My 2 girlfriends and I went to Vegas during 'Singles Weekend', got into line at 10:30 (only 30 minutes after they opened), and waited 2 hrs and 15 minutes to get through the door.  Therefore, unless you exhibit extreme patience and have superpowered feet for a girl, or are willing to throw down a few wads of cash...GO elsewhere.  We were willing to wait + did NOT have superpowered feet+ did not throw down extra cash, but really wanted to try the newest Club in Vegas.  

So the girls in front of us attempted to take off their heels after over an hour wait, and were told by crowd control that it was a safety hazard (what PITAs!!!)

What's worse, we specifically took notice of the people that were being let in through the sides and to be frank, being 'hot' was NOT the token for the night.  As a matter of fact, the weirdest looking folks were getting let in due to VIP tables, being actual guests at the Encore, or knew the lady with the clipboard.

Even with ALL this taken into consideration, the club and the entire experience was well worth the wait.  What?! you say.  Even after all that, it was still worth it?  YES.  XS is just THAT amazing if you're about the ambiance.  My favorite part of XS would be the decor, specifically the walls.  I've walked into Donald Trump's GOLD ROOM in his Country Club and his Gold Room in one of his mansions and I must say, I felt like I was stepping into them once again.  The best way to describe it would be that the entire place was draped in gold and had an sexy\/edgy feel: ""women trapped behind gold cloth trying to escape"" is how I would describe the walls. SO creatively seductive! 

XS will forever be engrained in my memory as the place I broke my ""1 drink wonder"" status.  The bartenders are hotties, the crowd is pretty decent, and the music was bumpin'.  My feet forgive you for all the pain they endured in line. Oh, I love you XS.",0,0,0

The music was on point with three DJ's playing only house that night. 

I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas!",1,0,0

I guess.  Yeah, with the line wrapping out and about the walkway, waiting in line EVEN IF YOU HAVE BOTTLE SERVICE, waiting in line and finding out THEY SOLD YOUR TABLE TO SOMEONE ELSE, walking in and the crowd is PUSHING so hard that you are moving by the sea of people PUSHING, security doing NOTHING but watching people hop over potted plants and walkways just to get across, 20-somethings trying to SQUEEZE through the sea of people spilling their drinks all over you as they fight the crowds....I mean, if you're into that...then yeah, it's the HOTTEST club out there.  

C'mon Steve Wynn.  Tryst and Blush is AMAZING and then you got XS?!?  BEWARE, this place is the type of place you see in the news because there was a fire and people died due to herds of people trampling on them and the club staff\/security does not have control of the club.  This is the type of place where you wait 3 rows deep of people to get a drink.  This is the type of place that charges guys $50.00 (though I can't hate too much, i didn't pay to get in) to walk through the door.  This is the type of place where you have to tip the VIP hosts $300 because he hooked us up with deal on bottle service and not waiting in line...just to wait in line for a bit and finding out our table was sold from under us.  

Yes, thank you host for selling our table.  We weren't forced to stay here, which was a blessing.  And we stayed a total of 20 minutes (after all the guys paid $50.00\/each) just to flow through the mosh-pit crowd of people to push us throughout the club.  Again, c'mon Steve Wynn....is this how you run a club these days?

XS is a fire hazzard waiting to go bad.....

Not in LA, New York, Chicago or Miami, not like this. Sorry but you can't beat it. 

The line on friday and saturday nights will get long and crowded. Again, avoid this inconvenience by arriving early or opt for bottle service and you should be right in no time. If you find yourself in the General Admission or Guest List, XS management has made a few changes recently and added a second entrance just for you to alleviate the congested line, you now have a different entrance by the Encore registration area on the opposite side of the club. The main entrance is now only for hotel guests and table reservations. On sunday nights XS holds its cool Night Swim pool party. Swimwear is encouraged, you don't wanna miss this one.

The most expensive and best club in the U.S and it lives up to its name. It is too much of everything.. A full blown state-of-the-art dance club with a pool, cabanas, tables and a mini casino. Surrender Nightclub might be its equal as far as clubs go in my opinion but XS is the club that started it all. It's elegant and upscale, the whole club experience and atmosphere is fun and exciting. XS Nightclub in Las Vegas has set the bar high. It should be the standard other dance clubs could try to measure up to. Don't try it Miami, New York because I've been to quite a few of your clubs and they fall short. 

Guys just be cool and watch your tab, it can get crazy here, I lost track of mine and ran it to $$$$ damn but it was worth it. I got lucky with one of the girls that joined me and my friends inside no joke. So have fun and don't forget you're in Vegas. Enjoy yourselves!",10,3,6

Design: when you first walk in there's outlines of naked girls in gold on the wall giving XS a great ambiance. The design of this club is amazing, the lights the setup of the tables makes you feel like your in an opera theater. All the lights camera action is on you! The lights are super bright and crazy also sometimes they throw confetti which looks cool in the light. 

Music: I would say XS competes with Marquee big time, both clubs are the major bookers for headliners. Like Skrillex, Calvin Harris, Dada Life, Afrowack, etc. because this club is ""up there"" they have to book big. They throw crazy parties. This place is huge especially during summer but I went when Afrowack was playing. The place wasn't so packed but they again I think I walked in like 1:30AM LOL 

Dancing: I was surprised there was a lot of room to dance on the dance floor, but my friends and I found ourselves near the strippers poles. A lot of girls were dancing there too and oddly no one was mean or bitchy. 

Line: there's no guest list on the weekends so don't even try, we walked in with a promoter plus we had 6 girls so its never hard for a big group of girls to get in but the line was ridiculously long even at 1:30AM when I decided to hop over after visiting surrender and tryst to finally end up at XS lol..

Bouncers: At XS they don't mess around trust me, no sense of humor for a drunk girl like me. Thank god I didn't kicked out. Bartenders didn't go to the bar but I passed by it, super busy at all times. Drinks were probably over priced but that's Vegas for ya.",5,1,4

The place was done up super fancy, the crowd was enthusiastic, and some of us couldn't remember bits of the night afterward (always the hallmark of a great night out).  The music was almost exclusively techno\/house music, which was fine (we were sloshed enough with alcohol that we probably could have danced to upbeat classical and been happy), but some variety would have been nice. 

PROS:
*VERY pretty - it was very dark in there, but you could tell (and can tell from pictures) that the decor is very lively.  It was also pretty spacious, despite the mass of crowds there.
*Sparkle from the sky! - every once in a while, they'd release big pieces of confetti from the ceiling, which was pretty nice.  Unfortunately it kind of got into our drinks, but that's what the straws are for!
*Strong drinks - Maybe we just had strong-TASTING drinks, but I thought they were stronger than the average drink you'd get at open bar.  Which is what we did, because we didn't believe in buying drinks in Vegas.  
*Good-looking people - always a plus.  If you MUST be involuntarily pressed against a stranger, it's best if the stranger is attractive, in my opinion.  Even better if the stranger has a fancy European accent.  Swoon.
*Not too packed - the dance floor was pretty full, but people weren't actively shoving each other and more just squeezed through.  And there was enough room for my girlfriends and me to carve out our own little circle.  
*Seating! (kind of) - there's some ledges between tables on the perimeter of the dance floor, and people didn't seem to mind when you sat on them.  Which is always nice after a few hours of dancing and  your feet are killing you. Some places, there's NO places to sit at all, it feels like.
*Efficient lines in - the lines going in were very efficient, and although it was kind of long when we got there, we were in the club in 10 minutes.

CONS:
*Stairs - They're not big flights of stairs, more like two or three steps.  But when it's dark and you're tipsy and the strobe lights are kind of making you dizzy, I feel like people could possibly trip on them.
*Slightly pissy bartender - Our bartender seemed to be in a bad mood, but since we only interacted with him for all of five minutes, and it was open bar, we couldn't really complain.  No tip that time though.

I adore this club and it now tops my list of my fave clubs in the USA. This is THE best club in the entire USA, hands down! (I met a Korean tourist on the plane the next day and even he agrees!)

We ran into Freddie Figs from MTV's Double Shot at Love. And a lotta sexy crazy people. Crazy as in ""I don't care how silly I look or act because I'm in Vegas baby!"" 

I was wearing a blue dress with a big bow that day. When I walked in, there was a jewel in the middle of the bow. Somehow it was ripped off in the midst of my journey into this crazy place. Between the dude and the chick, I swear it was the chick's fault! 

The club is pretty big, with one wall completely open to the outside. There are beds outside and other lounging furniture, and you can even dance in the pool. But on the night we went the pool was closed and you couldn't dive in. But that didn't stop this one drunk dude from jumping in!

I have been to XS Nightclub a couple times, once for Avicii - which was EPIC! I would say this is one of the luxurious clubs I have been to in Vegas as admission price is the price ranging from $25 - $75+ a night -matters if you are a female or male. Male price is of course, more expensive. To play around, I asked the ticket seller, well what if your gay? or can you dress up like a woman and then come and pay the lower price? Of course, not haha.

It is a two story club, there is a large dancefloor with a bar inside alongside the DJ booth and go go dancers with a lot of sitting space. The outside is where you will be able to walk around the pools, jacuzzis, and poker\/game tables. Some nights you can go into the pool and jacuzzis and actually swim and dance which is awesome and fun! The second floor is outside and you can usually find the private seating areas up there but they give a nice view of the Wynn hotel and the environment is flourishing and very well taken care of. 

I saw Avicii here and he was amazing. Confetti, popping bottles, getting your feet wet, dancing til 4am, going to other peoples private seating areas getting free drinks, and dancing on the poles was all my favorite. In other words, this is such a party club! Watch out though, you might be hungover the next day from all the crazyness!

The two bars that are visible are outside and inside - they are a mission to get to the front, but if you are there waiting in line then eventually you will get your drinks - just buy all yours in one purchase so that you don't need to repeatedly keep waiting in the loads of people that are at the bar. YES, THIS PLACE GETS CROWDED, don't expect the dancefloor to be empty or easy to get into. 

My favorite moment was when I was able to take off my shoes and roll up my slacks and dance in the pool that just slightly rises above your ankles. I was totally getting wet to Avicii! You will get splashed if you decide to go into the pool area where everyone is dancing behind the DJ booth and you will meet awesome people like I did from Brazil and London - they made me have an extra fun time!",2,1,1

Last Saturday, August, 23rd, my wife and I were to meet with a group of our friends to celebrate a birthday. I called a promoter and we were put on the guest list for the night, however when we arrived, we discovered that my wife was only on the guest list and I had to wait in the general admission line, since only girls were put on the guest list for the night.

We separated, and she had my phone so that she show the confirmation text to the host at the door. I then proceeded to wait in the general admission line for 2 hours, only to stand there and watch as the VIP host, Kalani, continuously accepted bribes from other people so that they could get in faster. All the while, the head of the line that I was in barely moved the whole time. 

In fact, the only reason it did move is because most of the people in front of me left out frustration or bribed the host to get in. Then, when I got up to the counter, the price was $150, which was obviously raised during the time I was in line. I don't understand why you would raise the price of admission for those coming in later. 

When I finally got into the venue, it was packed beyond belief, to the point that it was an obvious safety hazard. I stood in the entrance for about 20 minutes because I could not go anywhere. My wife finally found me there, but was almost unable to because when she was let into the VIP outside pool area, the host at the club portion of the club told her she would have to wait in the general admission line if she wanted get into that portion of the club or she would have to stay in the pool area since she basically got in for free. Why would an attendee on the guest list have to pay to get into another part of the club?

When she found me we ended up leaving since there was no point in trying to find our friends. Our experience was a complete waste of time and money and I am very upset that I was unable to get what I paid for and the night was ruined because of mismanagement and greed. Also, we saw two girls get carried out in wheel chairs, and while I know their alcohol consumption is their own responsibility, the club XS is at least somewhat responsible for what happens to it's patrons. 

I understand this is probably a usual occurrence, considering it was Saturday night, but I still don't get how a club would allow it to get that packed every weekend.",28,6,1

I guess part of the reason is that XS is located inside Encore, which is still one of the nicest hotels on the strip. The ridiculously long line that wraps around the outside of the club can be jaw dropping. Either plan to queue up before the club opens or find a reliable promoter that will walk you in. Small groups of well-dressed ladies should have no trouble doing this. As far as cover is concerned, I've never had to pay, but guys should expect to pay at least $30+. Peak weekends might even cost $100\/guy.

XS is a big club with gorgeous decor and a sprawling layout. There's an indoor section with multiple bars and tables encircling a dance floor with the DJ in the center. The dance floor isn't small, but there's always so many people there that you feel like you're in a mosh pit. Fortunately, there are two pole sections at the front of the dance floor for the drunk ladies to get their dance on. For those who want some fresh air as they drink their night away, there's an outdoor section that is more chill and spacious. It comes with a giant pool, more bars, upstairs cabana tables worth $$$$$, and a small gambling area. The only downside is that you can't really hear the music.

The crowd is mixed (there ARE a lot of Asians) and everybody's dressed to impress. Drinks run at your typical Vegas prices of around $15\/drink. The DJs are mainstream headlining giants so expect all the Top 40 EDM radio hits. Expect a lot of fist pumping and glowstick waving.

My biggest complaint about this club is...THE SMELL. Dear lord. For some reason, the whole club smells like the armpit of a dude who hasn't showered for a week. Maybe something died in the rafters but they need to find the source and exterminate it. Please just put some Febreeze in the air conditioning because the stench is toxic.

The dance floor is centrally located in the front of the club and is small to medium in size. The one thing that annoyed me about the dance floor was that people were using it just to get to another area of the club instead of walking around it. The music selection was a nice mix of hip hop and house. The lines to get drinks were horendous. Probably fifteen minute wait. I was very happy that I had drinks before going in.

This place is really cool... spacious and there's a pool area outside. It does get really crowded though. But I'm still alive (though I got a loose toenail at the end of one night, but that's not XS's fault).

I'm excited to go back. People who haven't been to XS should definitely give it a try. I never really have much to say about clubs, but then I think I just don't remember much and honestly, it's really one of those things that you should experience for yourself anyway. The line looks horrifically long but it's really not that bad -- it goes by quicker than you'd expect. Bring $$ if you're going to have to pay to get in, especially the guys if you want to speed up the process, be prepared to shell out some more cash.

My jaw literally dropped and the hairs on my neck started to stand as I entered XS. All you have to do is imagine yourself walking into a rap video set. One is immediately greeted with good music and upscale ambiance. Lighting was perfect.. not too dark with just enough light so there are no super big surprises later on (what I mean by that is ..""is that what she looks like in the light?) 

We had an outdoor table with bottle service so I'm not going to rate their bartenders. Our hostess was super friendly and kept checking in with us making sure everything was fine. Four bottles was the minimum for our outdoor cabana table... which was rather high, since there was only 5 of us. 

It was Saturday night and the line to get in wrapped around the entire hotel corridor. Even the bottle service line was 100 people deep. Of course, we arrived fashionably late and approached the front. They shunned us away and told us to wait in the table service line! (that's the reason for the -1 star) We don't wait in lines! What the heck! The host quickly came and explained to us that there was no official VIP line and to wait in the regular table reservation line and we will be pulled out and let in. Surely enough.. within 5 minutes we were pulled out of line.. went between the velvet ropes and led to our awaiting table. 

Impressive establishment, great layout and good staff make this place a must visit spot if your in Vegas. Tip: be prepared to drop some serious cash to have fun, because the only way to do it is table service. If your a girl, then be prepared not to drop a dime because people are popping bottles all night long! Also, the place is HUGE.. your bound to lose some of your homies somewhere while roaming the club (but hey, your not here to hang out with the homies are you?) 

They do have tables inside the club to gamble, so if you pick up on someone, you can show them what a baller you are and lose money on a dumb bet because you are too drunk to realize what your doing. 

Mr Wynn, I have to admit, you've outdone yourself with XS. Just like the name implies, one is immediately overwhelmed by an excess of what makes Vegas... well.. Vegas.

I can't blame them for the weather as it was really hot, but the only cooling source they had was in the center island in the form of mist. There was a bar in there but the main attraction in that area were the gambling tables. 
The disappointment started after we got out first drinks and looked around, realizing no one was doing anything out there. Everyone was either sitting, getting a drink, or at the tables. Every single planter ledge was full. Barely anyone got a table and the cabanas were empty. It was soooooo boring! We had no idea what to do. There was not really anywhere to dance and no one seemed like they were having fun. The music itself did not seem very loud in the patio area.

I do prefer Marquee more but this place is also a great place to listen to DJs and dance the night away. You walk in and you just see the huge stage completely lit up. It is quite amazing. 

That night Steve Aoki was going to perform so the crowd was even bigger than usual on a Monday night. It was a bit empty at 11pm since he was going to go on until 1am or so so in the meantime the girls can get drinks from tables and guys can creep on others. But man, when Steve Aoki came out, the place went crazyyyyy and everyone was really enjoying themselves. He was crowd surfing and he sure knows how to give a show.

This club does not have a huge patio like Marquee so there are even fewer places to rest. I luckily found a spot to rest more abused feet in the back where the tall pillars are. There is enough space for a small group to sit so I was thankful for that. When Turbulence came on, I just popped right back up and stood on top of the block thing so I could see the performance. It was still tons of fun :)

I went to XS on a Sunday and decided to do the night swim because how often can you go in the pool at nighttime right? Girls just wore cover up dresses and you can rent a bag near the pool for $10 which is not bad at all compared to $40 at the day club. So about 40% the people are in the pool, the rest are all dressed up and purty. I have a feeling the hotter guys were all dressed up because the pool area wasnt so hawt. Girls beware, if you are near the front closest to the dj, they will start splashing at the drop and your face my fall off. Obviously people lounge around and throw beach balls but other than that, you dont really dance in the water. There is a small jacuzzi area that is really really warm if your heart desires. It was a cool experience but Id much rather get all dolled up and go out in a dress.

**TIPS**
1) You have to check out XS when you are in Vegas. This is what real clubbing is like.
2) If you do night swim, it is only on Sundays and you can rent a locker to put your shiz in.
3) Enjoy!",1,0,0

People were really happy and friendly too! So there was good vibes everywhere.

I had a pre-arranged agrement with XS nightclub earlier in the week to set a rate for bottle service to cover several bottles of greygoose vodka.  I locked in the agreement via email, text, and phone conversation.  About an hour prior to entry, they increased the price per bottle by approximately over $150.  Due to the high demand, they said they increased the price...seriously??... this is also known as ""PRICE GOUGING"" ...what happened to the good old fashion honoring your word\/contract.   Since I was hosting some friends\/ colleagues and many made arrangements to be at XS, I was in a tough position not to cancel so I continued on with the plan.  I addressed the issue with the supervisor at XS and they clearly said they can breach the contract anytime (what's the point of a contract?) which I thought was ethically foul and unprofessional.  In addition, we were wrongfully charged for items during the midst of the celebration thinking we wouldn't notice it.  I have spent thousands of dollars and hosted many friends\/ colleagues at this particular club about a dozen times whenever I'm in town because I like to stay at the Wynn hotel and due to the clubs spacious and classy atmosphere.

Because they spared no expense, friends.  This place is huge, the vibe is sexy, and the people are as beautiful as money can buy.  Especially on a Monday in Las Vegas.  It's industry night, so expect to shake it harder for free perks.  

We arrived shortly before Midnight and paid a cover charge ($20 for me; $30 for him).  Then, on a hunch, I dropped my name to a dude with a clipboard, he checked the guestlist (sign up free on the Wynn's website to be contacted soon by a promoter: http:\/\/www.encorelasvegas.com\/#\/nightlife\/xs_reservations\/) and then REIMBURSED us for the cover charges.  That's right, they said, ""you shouldn't have to pay"" and actually put $50 BACK on our card... which paid for a few vodka sodas for yours truly.

A cute gal wandered around with tequila and vodka-guava shooters.  Might want to ask how much they are in advance, since $12 a pop adds up when you offer to buy a round for your friends.

It was my first time visiting Vegas in the summer so I didn't realize the pool was open. A lot of party goers were wearing swimwear and spent most of their time chilling by\/in the pool.

Since that option wasn't option to us, my friends and I went crazy on the dance floor instead :D And when we got tired, there was plenty of room for us to sit inside. Because most of the party was happening outside in the pool area, all the booths inside were free for the taking. 

It was SO nice that there was such easy seating available. My last trip to Vegas, this wasn't the case as it was too cold for the party to be outside, so all the booths inside were reserved.

I've been to XS several times (most recent on Saturday, 7.31.10) and EVERY single time my friends and I have had a blast and literally got B-L-A-S-T-E-D.

For once, the 850+ FOUR and FIVE Star reviews DON'T lie, XS is the BEST effen club there is in Vegas and anywhere else for that matter!!! And, if you don't pay a visit during your trip to Vegas, you will be missing out an EPIC night. 

You can read all the other reviews on how breath-taking and awesome XS is, so I'll spare you my ranting and stick to basics:

GUESTLIST:
Only on Sundays and Mondays. There are NO more free passes on the weekends. So, beware of those ""free passes"" on weekends that fake promoters pass out on the Strip (they ask for $10 tip); they are old and will not work.

COVER: 
*$20 for girls
*$50 for guys

A BIG thanks to James for getting the girls in free and no wait in line! We heart you!

LINE: 
Even though XS opens at 10 PM, get in line NO later than 9:15 PM! The line grows FAST, so every second counts especially if you come with guys only. 

If you come in a high guy-to-girl ratio (1:1 is needed) and after 10 PM...GOOD LUCK trying to get in! You should either book bottle service (3 people\/bottle @ roughly $600\/bottle + tips that increase the later you book) or be prepared to tip the bouncer to get in (FYI, some guys that came to XS at 10:30 PM told me they paid $200 each to get in). 

DRESSCODE:
Collared shirts for guys, no shorts, tennis shoes or flip flips. HOWEVER, I've seen guys in T-shirts and chucks and girls in flip flops. But, don't risk it; DRESS TO IMPRESS!

MUSIC:
Hip Hip and Pop mixed w\/ House beats. Still not a fan of the music, but it's all about the company and alkie!

CROWD:
Mixed crowd w\/ 30% being Asian. It seems the age of the crowd differs during the seasons. Because of spring and summer break, there are a lot of people in their early 20s during these months. 

BAR:
Three bars: 2 inside and 1 outside. 

DRINKS:
Yay for $13 for top shelf liquor and shots! The last time I went to XS in March 2010 the drinks were $17. They may have adjusted their drink prices based on the increase in cover?

""THE"" POOL:
A MUST GO! Ladies, relieve your aching feet from the 5' stilettos you've been walking in at the pool (only allowed in the ""wading"" area). The boys are now allowed to go in the pool too, but security does watch them like hawks to make sure their pants don't get too wet, otherwise you will get kicked out.

And, if you like to leave w\/ a BANG, jump into the center of the pool! You will be nicely escorted out (through the back), so ONLY do this before you decide to leave! My friends and I decided to jump in before we left and it was definitely the highlight of our trip! You can only stay in for a mere second before security spots you, so make sure to have a friend ready to snap pictures. And, beware of all the stares you WILL get on the way back to your hotel. 

RESTROOMS:
One inside w\/ 20+ stalls and one outside w\/ 10 stalls. There's never a wait for more than several minutes--THANK GOD!

SO REMEMBER...
1. Get to XS NO later than 9:15 PM. 

2. Make sure ALL your friends are w\/ you when lining up. There are NO holding spots for friends, otherwise they will get kicked OUT of the line. So, make sure your lagger friends are on-time. 

3. If you're a guy or go w\/ a group of guys and want to get in, get there early, book a bottle (3 people\/bottle),OR be prepared to tip the bouncers.

4. There are NO longer GL or ""free passes"" on the weekends, so do NOT get them from people who claim they are ""promoters"" on the Strip.

5. Ladies, buy a pair of cheap flip flips and switch them off w\/ your stilettos when you're near the front of the line. TRUST ME, your feet will thank you. 

6. All CC transactions at the bar require your ID, so remember to get it back from the bartender after signing your bill. 

7. If you book a table, request one inside or right near the pool; that's if you want to meet people (the cabana area has less foot traffic).

8. Do NOT get caught dosing off b\/c the bouncers will escort you out ASAP. HOWEVER, sliding them a Jefferson or two may prevent you from being ousted. 

9. Do NOT jump into the center of the pool unless you're ready to leave b\/c you will be escorted out. However, there is such a thing as ""accidents"" right?. *cough*

10. MOST IMPORTANTLY, LIVE BY THIS MOTTO: How you live shouldn't concern others. It's how others live & what they do unto others that they should be more worried about. It's Vegas after all and just about anything goes, so let go of your inhibitions and have the time of your life! :)",61,21,21

I've been here for Kaskade and Zedd and had fun both times! For Kaskade it was suuuper crowded so we ended up staying on the patio (not tryna touch sweaty people, yuck), but still had tons of fun! For Zedd, I was inside on the floor and got pretty close to the front! Unlike some other clubs (*cough*hakkasan*cough), I didn't have that many people pushing me or stepping on my toes, which I was so grateful for!!! I guess the crowd control\/security is good here because they actually know when to cut off the inside. However, on the contrary, if you try to get inside too late, you will be cut off and not allowed in because of the huge crowd. So try to get inside and stay inside!!

Girls on guest list usually get 2 drink tickets each, which is soo nice in case your buzz wears off in line, haha. Vodka cranberry, anyone?? They have a lot of bars in different places, it's just kinda annoying when it's crowded and you have to wait super long for your drink.

I highly recommend bottle service because it will give you a place to party. My group of girls ended up dancing on top of the banquettes next to a group of guys who had purchased a table for the evening (thankfully they were gentlemen and did not mind us dancing!)

If you're going for a bachelor\/ette party, purchase one of the party packages which includes open bar for 1 hour plus drink tickets if you don't want to splurge on bottle service.

What was so fabulous about XS: 
- The extravagant decor. Million and millions were spent on this place and it actually shows. 
- The indoor\/outdoor layout. Yes it's just like Tryst but XS's outdoor area totally smashes on Tryst's waterfall. 
- The pool\/lagoon and the bar right smack in the middle of it. Can't wait to see how it's used during the summertime. 
- The size of the club. It's huge! No need to push and shove even if it's crowded. 
- The crowd. You don't get your typical freshly-turned 21 crowd like in Tao. 
- Seating. Even if you don't have bottle service, you can still sit in a booth\/reserved spot if it's not being utilized. 
- Music. Well the music for the first hour that we were there was top notch and totally danceable to. After that, you can tell they switched DJ's as it was straight hip hop from then on. 
- Lighting. With the chandelier and lights beaming on the dance floor, you totally get that club vibe, unlike some places where it's just dim to dark everywhere.

I'm not sure about the drink prices as my fiance paid for everything. And not sure about entrance fees as we got in for free.

To sum it up, I had the best time at XS then in the other Vegas clubs that I've been too. Some places really have to step up their game now.",3,1,0

The bouncer that wears the grey suit takes bribes, and lets people cut. So unless you get there early enough, and\/or is willing to pay the guy $100 to get in, go elsewhere. While I was standing, he probably made close to $1000 alone. 

Second- presale tickets don't really matter, unless you arrive EARLY. Once the club gets packed, you'll still have to wait for hours before getting in, or pay the guard a bribe.

I saw Zedd and it was a very good performance. I had a random girl continually slap my butt, I'm guessing because she was trying to pick pocket me, as I was in the crowd dancing. She kept doing it, in a upward motion like she's trying to flip my wallet upwards from my back pocket. Seems like it, from all the other posts on here. Saw another asian guy do the same as well against some other guy who was dancing with his girl. Slapped his butt, and looked away. Keep your wallet, and phone in the same front pocket so you're able to feel if someone is attempting to grab them. 

Other than me wanting to rip the stupid perm off the 5'2"" guard wearing the grey suit, I enjoyed seeing Zedd, 1 hour into his performance.",0,0,0

I went with my friend to see Avicii on a busy weekend.  We were given free entry and three complimentary drink tickets (which ends up being a $30 value because drinks are insanely expensive there).  We had been warned about long waits to enter, but much to our delight, we did not have to wait in line to get in.  The people working the door were very quick and efficient.

I was astounded when we walked in.  The pool bar was beautiful and extravagant.  There are several different bars\/themed rooms, based on what you're in the mood for.  

Avicii was playing in the main room.  Entrance into the show was an extra $25, but I was fine with that price to see him.  We ended up super close to the stage.  It was an awesome experience.

We loved the bar and dance floor in the main room.  The lighting, special effects and sound was excellent.  The drinks were also delicious and very strong!  Our favorite drink was the ""Adios Motherf*cker.""

I walk in and it was empty, both inside and out. But that's okay, it filled up FAST

This place is one of my favorite clubs EVER, its big and definitely does not feel too crowded. They have bars inside and out, so it's easy to pick up drinks for you or that special someone. It is also convenient for those who smoke, to simply walk outside and have a quick cigarette. If you come with a large group (10+) I suggest you do invest in a table or a cabana (1000$ Bottle Service)because finding your friends in the crowd is hard.

The facilities are nice, the bathrooms are clean. The outdoor area is also great, but beware of the table's out there, and do not fall into the pool.

The music choice here is great! It's nice to be able to stay on the dance floor because there is no bad music coming from the DJ booth. Also, the crowd here is typically friendly, and that is to be expected with a fairly high cover charge.

I would recommend having a few drinks on your own or at the local casinos before you come here, because a drink can easily cost you 15$+, but its totally worth the ambiance.

In the middle of the pool area is where there is tables for you to gamble. The minimum bets here are higher than most other place because of the venue.
The drinks here are pretty decent in price. I got 3 Henny and Coke, 1 Adios, and 1 Remy and coke came out to $72 not bad at all. The drinks were quite strong i l love it!

Just like NYC, the hotels\/casinos, restaurants, lounges\/clubs\/bars, shopping, shows, and day parties compete with one another every year for the avaricious title of ""THE Place to See and to be Seen."" 

We were meeting my sister and friends there but since we left the Encore Beach Club just after 7 pm, we had plenty of time to power nap, shower, enjoy dinner, and still make it to XS by 10:30pm. Everyone else showed-up a couple hours later since they partied at the beach club 'till they could party no more. They were more of the hard-core crew and I didn't even qualify as one of their ""wannabes."" 

A corner-winding line had already formed for the pre-paid tix but luckily, one of the hostesses walked up to us, asked us for our names, checked us off the list, wrote our names on another piece of paper, and directed us to step-out of the line and walk straight-up to the guy at the front entrance who let us through the doors. SWEET and good-bye long line! 

It wasn't packed inside yet so getting that first drink was a breeze...and now that I think about, even after the place became jam-packed, getting drinks was never really a challenge. All of the servers and bartenders were attentive, quick, and friendly! They somewhat reminded me of the servers and bartenders in the Gaslamp District (San Diego) where servers and bartenders are incredibly fantastic and super-nice to boot! 

XS is gorgeous inside and out! Loved the décor, lights, color scheme, dance floor, tables\/booths, outdoor pool area, lounges, gambling tables, bar areas, and ample bathrooms! I never once had to stand in line for a bio break and that was freaking amazing!!! 

Guys - do you know how badly it sucks to have to wait in endless bathroom lines after you've already waited to the very last minute to use the ladies room?! You don't? Well, let me tell you, it can be painfully awful! But at XS, there is no need for such potty-holding pain. Whoo hoo! 

To top it all off, Afrojack was deejaying for Memorial Day and he was phenomenal! I LOVED his mixes and even though no one else was dancing outside yet, I couldn't help myself. It's times like that when I wished I wasn't wearing a cocktail dress and instead had on jeans, a cute top, and comfy boots, so that I could bust-out a head spin or a back twist dance move. 

Ha ha ha, okay, maybe nothing that serious but I'll tell you what, about a couple hours into the night, a cool dance circle formed outside by the pool and a few of the nearby dance pro's started working their magic. It was really entertaining and fun to watch! All of them had very different dance styles and I think I walked away with a few new dance moves. Lol. 

Anyway, I loved XS and I cannot wait to visit again for another great night of lounging, dancing, meeting new peeps, and soaking-in Vegas's escape from reality.

We purchased presale tickets which i highly recommend to anyone who wants gauranteed entry to the club. This place gets packed quick! We arrived to the club around 1015pm and literally walked right in because we had presale tickets so that was awesome. It was a really beautiful club inside and out. drink prices seemed normal about 13.00 a drink. 

We were very lucky to have a friend end up buying a cabana so we had our own private space which gave us a good view of the crowd down below.

Yes, the bouncers can be douche bags, but a little confidence goes a LONG WAY. I walked in like I owned the place (I'm not a bitch, I just refuse to be pushed around), told them I was on the guest list, and walked right in (free of charge! Plus we each got 3 drink tickets). It pays to have ovaries.  

I was wearing a green boa (it was St. Patty's Day) but they wouldn't let me take it inside the club (apparently it's a weapon?), however they were nice enough to hold it for me and I got it back at the end of the night.

People repeatedly asked the bouncers when they're going to open the door to no avail. This lasted for about two hours untill we eventually left around 3am. And guess what?

I'm going take my money elsewhere and spend it where I'll be treated with honesty and respect. I'm sure such a huge club like XS won't miss me, but guess what? I won't miss them either.

P.S., go to Hakkasan.

TL,DR: go to Omnia.",3,2,1

The club was fun and we had a great time however we were treated rather rudely upon arrival. As a traveling couple in Las Vegas for birthday fun we weren't aware that you had to be on the guest list for ladies to get in free. By the way, we went on a Monday night and ladies are $30 and men are $50, very over priced. My fiancé spoke with Johnston (promoter) and he informed us he would get me in for free and we'd just have to pay for my fiancé. By the time we got to the entrance Johnston was no where to be found. When I finally found him he acted very flustered and annoyed that we were asking him to come vouch for us at the pay line . By the time his boss got involved my fiancé was aggravated that we had to wait so long and there was so I confusion. Needless to say his boss decided not to give us what Johnston promised even after we apologized for being annoyed and frustrated. It was a very embarrassing experience. My advice would be to not flaunt something you can't deliver on. The bartenders weren't personable and very standoffish as well.

Even though it has been around for years, this thing still cranks and is one of the top Nightclubs in Sin City. With that said, there is a ton of competition in Vegas as far as nightlife and I can see that XS isn't as on top of their game with every detail like they used to be. Then again, maybe it was just because I was there on a Monday? My best friend was celebrating her birthday so we got together a ton of girls, probably about 15 or so. We had a table on the dance floor and a few bottles. XS knew it was her Birthday and one of our girls called ahead of time to organize the details for the Birthday Cake presentation at the table, and another girl from our group brought cupcakes ahead of time for them to keep in their refrigerator and be delivered when the cake was. A little bit into the night the cocktail waitress came to the table to give us some really bad news....the news was that the cake they originally told us would be brought out was not in the refrigerator....apparently they had no more left? AND...our cupcakes where missing!! We had nothing to give to the Birthday girl! So what happened to her cake and cupcakes? Did they even have a cake prepared in the first place? This is Las Vegas people...where dreams come true and you are spoiled...it's a fantasy land...a dream world....now that they messed up...you would think that they would have already thought of what to do...instead of sending a clueless waitress to the table to just inform us the Birthday cake is MISSING. Plus XS is inside the Wynn...so they couldn't go and get a cake or dessert from one of the restaurants or bakery's inside there?? We kindly asked for something to be done and suggested we would even take another bottle or something to make up for it...instead they ended up moving us to a table in back of the DJ, (amazing view)but unfortunately there was a little less then half of the seating  then at the dance floor table. Then they brought out a silver plate of strawberries and chocolate chips with a couple candles in the strawberries, I guess that's all they could do.

After having a great day over-indulging at the Encore's European Pool, we needed a nap which resulted in us not getting to the club until 3am.  We were somewhat afraid we would miss the show entirely, but luckily the party here truly goes all-night.

Being 3am, there was no line into the club at that point, but the party was still in full swing and the normal $20\/30 cover charge still applied.  We entered the club in a matter of minutes.

The club itself is amazing.  Great sound system and very impressive lights.  There is a pit area in front of the stage for people to rock out, and a healthy number of bottle-service tables overlooking the pit.  There is also an outdoor area open around the European pool for people wanting fresh air.  Also, there was an absurdly high amount of attractive girls there.  I don't know what more anybody could want in a club.

The only problem (and it's a big one) is the behavior of guests in the pit.  About 80% of the party-goers politely faced the stage and moved to the beat while respecting the personal space of others.  The other 20% however, would incessantly push their way throughout the crowd.  While 20% is a minority, it is still enough to put EVERYBODY In a bad mood.  It resulted in nobody wanting to give an inch to anybody else, even if a person was politely trying to exit the pit.  The amount of pushing\/blocking resulted in the pit resembling a drunken football game.

Normally every club with this setup has this issue to a small extent.  However the situation at XS is the worst I've ever seen.  Most clubs have bouncers strategically perched over the pit-area to enforce a basic level of decency; I saw no evidence of that here.

We retreated to the outdoor area and watched Morgan Page perform from a poor vantage point.  It was enjoyable, but could have been better if security could control the crowd.",0,0,0

NERO never came on stage and it was not clearly indicated that the performance was only a DJ set.  This is considered false advertising.  The interior decor was mediocre, and a serious lack of seating and floor space for dancing; the layout was all wrong.

First like many Vegas clubs(we were are used to) it was $50 a person to get in and that is being on the guest list and you have to have an equal ratio of guys to girls.  The line experience is horrifying and the staff is just plain rude.  One of the things you come to know and expect in clubs is the dress code.  We were all dressed up with collared shirts, slacks, and dress shoes.  When we got there it was like come as you are night with most wearing trashy lounging attire(shorts, hats, flip flops).  When you call they will tell you the dress code is strictly enforced.  There really wasn't a dance floor to speak of and the outside was so crowded we almost got pushed in the pool.  There were literally people walking around half or mostly naked, which does not scream upscale.  Cocktails here are unbelievable $15 for a kamikaze shot.  A regular drink is upwards of $25 and nothing is strong.  Everyone should beware of club promoters as well, they can get you on a guest list or in for ""free"" but this is a joke.  Our club promoter Anthony or Brad that got us in is a thief and liar. He sold us ""open bar"" which is not uncommon for certain clubs in Vegas but for XS, it doesn't exist.  The fact we were taken was not directly XS's fault.  However, these are the people XS hires to promote their club.  The shady tactics are a direct reflection of their business.

The line was organized, but the only problem i had was when I went to the restroom (before the club) and when I went back in line, the (power-hungry) security lady got mad at me for going under the ropes of the line when a bunch of my friends were there. 

After that little situation, it was all good. Gotta love a club where stripper poles are available for drunk girls (like me) to dance on. Lol.
I loved the music and the lights. Although it was kind of crowded on the main dance floor, once I stepped outside to the pool area I was quickly refreshed and ready to dance again. 

My friend and I went over to the bar by the pool, and it took a while for the bartender to serve us, but it didn't matter cuz the atmosphere is so nice, I was just dancing while waiting. 

Too Short ended up showing up to the club later on, and sang an oldie.. ""blow the whistle."" My friends and I all had a great time dancing, and getting danced on (lol) at this club. I definitely want to go here again.

The DJ booth is up at the front with the dancefloor and the booths are in two levels around the dancefloor in semicircles with the bar on the perimeter. 

The great thing about the music system is that it's super clear and not muddled even though it's so loud. My boyfriend and I went to see What So Not and Salva on consecutive Sunday and Monday nights. Unfortunately I paid in advance but if you use Chris Hornak's service we could have gotten free passes to Salva plus free drinks for ladies until midnight! We loved the music of course and enjoyed rocking out right up next to the DJ booth festival style. Both nights we were there the club was packed and the energy was fantastic. Plus there were two go-go dancers on platforms next to the front. 

If you ever need to rest your feet, you can always sit in the spaces between the booths, where we took a break. And did I mention the bathroom? I don't know about the guys but the ladies restroom is so clean and spacious with lots of mirrors, and has a plethora of body sprays, perfumes and hair sprays available to use plus an attendant. Another great feature is the open air behind the DJ so the club didn't get too hot, cooled by the March night breeze.

The first time I went, we had bottle service for my friend's birthday. He is a VIP at Wynn and was in one of the largest suites at Encore so you think they would have given him a little something. No! They put as at this SMALL ASS table, OUTSIDE (in December) that did not even have seating for four people. And there was no privacy or separation from regular guests. Not cool.

This past weekend, I went again (against my wishes) with my friends to XS because Calvin Harris was playing. Once again, we were staying at a suite in Encore. It worked out a little better this time because guy tickets were sold out but we were able to get them because of staying at the hotel. Let me say, Calvin Harris was AWESOME! He put on an amazing show. And I already knew to expect that the venue would be crowded. But seriously - we were packed so tight (inside AND outside) that you couldn't even put your hands up without hitting someone. And there was literally NO WHERE to move.

I've had good times here, I've had bad. But the good have definitely trumped over the bad and out of all the clubs I've been to in Vegas, this is still the one that's most beautiful, glamourous, fun, sexy, party rockin', crazy, etc etc.

Because of my wonderful promoter\/host, I've never had to pay a single dime to get in (unless it's for tables; they start at $2k) nor wait in the horrendous line. But since it's one of the hottest clubs in Vegas, guys have to expect to pay. Depending on what weekend, cover for guys can range from $40 to $150.

XS has multiple entrances and is one of the largest clubs in Vegas. It's also one of the most beautiful (has beautiful people too), with a main dance floor, plenty of areas to sit, lounge or dance, an area to gamble, and a shit ton of cabanas and tables. However, I think my favorite thing about XS is that there's a pool and various shallow areas where anyone can take their shoes off, dip their feet in and dance to the music.

Other than the upscale venue, they have great DJs too. I've seen Avicii, Steve Angello, and Morgan Page here, among many others. Sure, it's not as great as the usual line-up at Marquee, but the XS venue beats Marquee any day. (But if Marquee has a better DJ that night, you'll still catch me at Marquee... just saying.)",3,0,3

Well, it's because I have a lot of random stories that came from this club. And when you have stories to tell, then that obviously means the club is where it's at. True story.

Proof (a couple of stories out of my million): 

Story #1: The line was really long when my girls and I arrived. I really had to pee because we chugged down hella alcohol before leaving our hotel, and then we decided to chug some more in our classy water bottles while we were in line. OK, well to the point, I had to hold my pee because of my not-so-smart decision to drink that much, and since my group of friends were just a group of 3 girls, the bouncer (or whatever he was) gladly let us in since our vaginas were powerful in that way. (Girl power. Woot.) SO, SO THANKFUL I was in that group of girls (Yes, Vegas just works that way. Girls always get in for free.) And XS gladly let that happen on this wonderful night. I happily got to pee in their toilet before peeing on myself in their long ridiculous line. (We were only half way through their line for Christ's sake!) So coming from that experience, I think XS really likes girls, and I'm a girl, so XS likes me and I like XS.

K. Now onto Story #2) It was really crowded inside. As I was passing through crowds, a lot of alcohol spilled on me because people, when in Vegas, do not know how to hold glasses properly as they walk through crowds because they bump into everything, even air. I blame the people and not the club for this though. (It's ok, people, I forgive you.) Even though the crowdedness was a downfall in this club, I was drunk, so I easily forgot that once the DJ that night played some house music I happily bounced to with a really hot guy. 

Yeah, if it weren't for XS and it's magic letting me 1) cut in line, then 2) make me care less about the crowdedness, and THEN 3) land me a hot guy... then IDK what it is. I'm convinced it's XS' angels sending me down a Vegas miracle. I definitely had a good time.

And after that, everything else was a blur. (;

- A beautiful women's restroom with everything a girl needs: hairspray, a huge selection of perfume and lotion, gel, q-tips, and even a sewing kit (which btw, helped my friend out greatly that night)

What I can complain about was the music.  Terrible mash-ups and music that's hard to get into...i.e., Sweet Home Alabama.  Not cute.  Also, after 2AM I was completely gone due to the fact that their shots of Grey Goose tasted COMPLETELY WATERED DOWN!  I swear, it tasted like water and being the stupid drunk person that I am, I decided to double my doses.  6 shots of Goose later and 2 patron shots, I had to be wheel-chaired to my hotel room by security.

Got a table for a special event.  They put us on the PATIO because we spent less than $12,000.  I am actually embarrassed to disclose the amount we spent. The server was nice but with bottle service, they are really not doing much work.  Before that everyone we encountered was an ass. 

Also, what good is having a table at a club if you are not IN THE CLUB.  For the amount we spent, we could have flown to NYC and been at a real club, where the people are actually cool, the environment was authentic, not ""Vegas Authentic""  

I complained to the Wynn. They essentially said ""tough luck but please come back"" in corporate language. I guess I am not influential enough for them to care.

Yup.  Crowded bar, crowded bathrooms, and sometimes the music sucks.  But why is this the best club ever?  Because it is.  No matter what happens I cannot have a bad time here.  Probably because we are down to dance no matter what and just go all out.  Also, in my experience XS has the best guys.  Best looking, most normal, good personalities, great dancers.

$50 for the boys & $20 for the girls to get in on a Saturday night.  

Packed with people - super hot & stuffy on the dance floor - hung out near the pool side to get some air but it's Vegas in the summer time, baby, so it was HOT even with random breezes.  I almost joined the people dancing barefoot in the shallow end (shallow meaning like 3"" of water being splashed everywhere by girls in miniskirts).

Hip hop music and once in awhile some random alternative music & some 80's\/90's flashback music mash ups.

I quite enjoyed the outside area though. 

We were 2 minutes late for the guestlist and the bouncer said it was closed and did not let us in. Luckily, my friend had a hookup inside who can get us into any club for free, so we called him up.

This venue is very spacious and has a dark chic feel to it with it's velvety interior and dimmed lights. There was a pool lounging area outside but since it's winter, they had that blocked off but you can still see how big the place is with the glass walls. 

I bought one French Connection (cognac\/amaretto) and I was gone! It was well worth the $20 I spent on it because that bartender had a heavy hand. 

I went on a Sunday night and it was pretty much all hip hop music which I very much enjoyed. Although, the crowd was probably like late 20's, early 30's.

Came here last Saturday for Avicii over Independence Day weekend and the main dance floor was so packed, it was constant pushing and shoving even to get out. If someone fell, they would probably be trampled to death. (This is where Marquee actually gets it right when they crowd control the main dance floor.) Once you've spent 15 minutes trying to push, shove, and squeeze your way off the main dance floor, you'll be stuck to a small section of the venue (even outside) because bouncers will block off areas to prevent overflow.

Yet I still retain a favorable opinion of XS because last labor day on the Saturday with Steve Angello, I was still able to bust out a short shuffle on the main dance floor and then proceed to dip my feet in the pool with little to no pushing and shoving. It might have helped that Avicii was at Marquee that night.

So the rule of thumb? If Avicii is at XS, go to Marquee and vice versa. Levels is universally played at any club anyway.

One last thing: if you do decide more than a day before that you're going and can't do guestlist\/don't want to try, I highly recommend buying pre-sale tickets. Prices are usually $20\/$50 for girls\/guys a few weeks in advance and I believe $30\/$55 the week of, but it's super painless to get in line and in the venue that way.",2,0,1

I was honestly a bit disappointed by the music, but the party itself made up for it. There's plenty of places to sit, outside and the pool is the best place to be. It's the Wynn so don't complain about your $8 mini waters and pricey drinks. And expect to pay cover unless its Sunday and you found yourself on the promoters list(they're very nice btw).

As you can see from everyone else's photos the venue is HUGE, BEAUTIFUL, and AMAZINGLY well decorated!  As you walk into XS you automatically feel like you are VIP guest.  The pool, the lights, the cushions..everything is just jaw dropping.

This one guy told us that we could use these passes that he gave us for both saturday and sunday...but when we got to the door saturday night, the bouncer told us we could only use the pass on sunday. =(

Music: this was one of the lamest aspects..they would always play blocks of different genres..techno, hip hop, oldies, etc.  Wasn't a huge fan of any genre besides the hip hop so waiting for another hip hop song seemed like an eternity

What I noticed about this place is that there isn't really a centralized dance floor. I mean there is some space in front of the dj table but like not a lot. People just get crazy everywhere and make their own dance floor!

He was AMAZING. Great time dancing to him. Some cons were that the dance floor was shortened a great deal from how it regularly is so it was super crowded. People get kind of rowdy and rude here... and there are definitely creepers on patrol. For Sunday Night Swim, I don't really feel like bottle service is necessary because you're so far from the action! 

The bartenders were kind of rude... the same one kept charging all of us different prices for the same drinks! She ended up charging the guys LESS hoping to score tips or something.

It's just really difficult to flag them down as well because the area is so compacted. I like Surrender's set up a bit more because you're not crammed, and it's much easier to get a drink there. 

At one point, I had my drivers license and credit card in hand, bought the drinks, but I had to carry 4 so i turned around to give them to my friend to help me out. Well the guy next to us was being a big douche and creeper so I got booted from my space. I was just overwhelmed with all the drinks so i started moving towards the edge of the pool, literally 2 feet away. The bartender came running after me tapping me hardly telling me I didn't pay her and acted as if I had no intent to pay. I was like huh? And handed her my card and drivers license that were still in my hand! Does that look like I was trying to get away? And wouldn't I have gone much farther away and made a run for it? I literally just strayed 2 feet still trying to hand people drinks that I was loaded with. 

I followed her to the bar to get my card back. For TWENTY minutes she PURPOSEFULLY ignored me, even though I asked her multiple times loud and clear if I could possibly close out my tab. She kept walking by my card and credit card and bill in the black envelope, finally, she ran out of black envelopes, looked at my card, looked at me, threw my card into a cup, and put another guys card and receipt in there. It wasn't as if my card were far away from her, and out of her way. I was still really polite, I even tipped her 10 dollars as an apology.

However, I still feel this was unnecessary treatment. She treated me like a criminal. Also, she kept flirting with some dude behind the bar letting him slap her ass and stuff. Not very professional.. awkward to watch.

In this edition of DG for D's, I'm going to cover a premiere Vegas night club and extract it's venue perks towards your benefit.  This is also one of the few clubs where every girl will still look amazing after the lights turn on, so there's no need to rush out.

When you go to a night club, you need to be fresh, look fresh, and feel fresh.  The girls don't get Barbie'd up for nothing in this town so you need to do your part too, but do it with a cool sense of casual-class and finesse.  Down-dress with a nice untucked dress shirt with your sleeves rolled, slim designer jeans, dress shoes other than black, and a loose, solid tie (optional, but highly recommended). 

Now on to the venue, XS is a club where the guys ""can"" get some loving, but how, you ask?  I feel your pain brother, that's why I wrote this installment.  Main rule of thumb, don't wait in the 2 hour line and don't go in broke.  Even if you manage to walk in with a group of lovely girls, you will need to order drinks.  Your best bet is to cut the line by booking a VIP table and\/or cabana with your boys and splitting the costs.  Girls love VIP and they love free bottle service so you're sure to attract a herd of them.  With that said, if you're not hitting it off, limit those skanks to 1 drink or risk getting played.

Did I mention the girls are easy?  For the most part they are.  Trust me, 85% are there to get some sort of action: simple flirting, subtle make out sessions, someone to dance with, or straight answer how they like their eggs in the morning question.  Over easy please.  Stay away from the other 15%, you'll immediately know who they are and don't question the validity of these statistics, it's certified as I've scientifically proven them during my last visit.

Make sure to stay away from any pair of girls since they usually want to dance with themselves, unless they approach you or emit an inviting aura a la cutesy wandering eyes.  Also, steer clear of groups larger than 4 unless you have backup.  There's too much criticism amongst these felines and you'll be heavily scrutinized.  Even if the entire group digs you, it takes one crazy bitch to say stop-no-and-don't to ruin your game.  3 is the magic number fellas, there are less girls to impress and you'll get a chance to charm them up on a more intimate level.  If you happen to cusp one away from her pack, the other two girls will still have each other so she's really not leaving her girls hanging.  Once you do, take her outside to cool off and dance at the shallow end of the pool.  Trust me and get your feet wet, this will show her your fun, adventurous side.

If you arrive a little late, well that's perfect!  The girls are already liquored up from the many guys offering them free drinks.  This is a good thing as these guys haven't read my guide so they're making our jobs easier and cheaper.  They don't call me Dr. Date, aka Mr. Steal-Your-Girl for nothing.  Have no shame, just roll on in and commit a robbery.  Also remember, these girls are already wet from how magnificent the venue is: the euro style décor and endless stripper poles, flashing lights and fancy limelights, gorgeously-lit pool area and spacious outdoor dance floor, loungy plush-white day beds, and party-rocking-world-class dj's.  XS is really doing us a favor.  You paid for it so use it towards your advantage.

Now go, young padawan, for you have the tools necessary to roam the short skirts of XS.  May good luck and fortune bestow upon you.  And remember kids, what happens in Vegas, stays...except for herpes.  That shit will come home with you.",43,80,34

The Vibe:  5 Stars
Ideal for groups in their early 20's to early 30's, Saturday night DJ's usually have a progressive house\/techno focus.  The crowd is pretty, but they know they are...
NOTE:  If you are in a group of guys, for a bach party or otherwise, having a table here is essential.  Trying to go inside and just buy drinks is a pretty rough experience and what you save in $$ you lose in sanity.  Either get a table or just go somewhere else.

The Service:  5 Stars
We had a team of 3 cocktails and 2 bouncers taking care of us.  This was overkill, but much appreciated!  The bouncers filtered the table guests and even escorted (via performing as Linebackers through the crowd) us to the restroom, waited for us, and escorted us back.  We did get a couple confused\/angry looks from people being moved out of the way.

The Cost:  2.5 Stars
As is expected, to receive this kind of attention and service requires money, I just had no idea it would be so much.  One of our group members is a GM at a Vegas club and even with his connection, which was highly valuable, our minimum spend was $3500.  We rocketed through that number and I had a litle sticker shock when I go my portion of the bill...

The Bottom Line:  If you have a fun group and very few budget restrictions, this is an ideal Saturday night Vegas spot, probably still top 3 on the strip according to my group and others we spoke with.  Whether to spend that kind of money should probably determined by the act that is performing that night.  If you have budget restrictions, there are plenty of options hurting for business on the strip.",2,0,0

one of the worst night clubs i ever been to. first of all if u didnt purchased the tickets online u gonna wait forever to get in. bouncers intentionally will not let u in since they can make money by having u wait. some people will pay extra bucks to get in faster around $20 a person. once u are in its pretty nice but they packed the club so much that forget abt dancing there no space to place ur foot. people are struggling to move around. it took me 20mins just to get out of dance floor. drinks are way to expensive $16.00 cocktail. its totally not worth going to this place. waisted my friday night and money here.",0,0,0

Dancing in the water in the shallow pool area
Cabanas\/sofas to lounge on near the water
Spinning Chandeliers
Beautiful view outside
Huge space (although it was packed but not TOO packed like Tryst)
The only thing I considered knocking a star off for was the music - I usually like hip hop, and they played a mix of other stuff at many points throughout the night.

We got a table\/bottle service and I highly recommend it since XS is one of the top clubs in Vegas right now. It's just easier not to become separated from your group, no need to fight the lines with others to get a drink at the bar, and I was pretty impressed with how fast & often they would come and check up on us. 

Music is mainly house and truthfully, I'm not much of a fan for  the house\/techno genre but XS just made it So.Much.Fun! They would play a hip hop song here and there but it was in very short spurts. The dance floor was packed! And I love how the bathrooms (girls bathroom) had VS fragrances, lotions, and such to use.

The place is nice and has an open airy feeling to it.. you don't feel like you suffocating. the dance floor is pretty big but its only crowded because everyone wants to battle on the dance floor or something... They have poles on top of stands practically all over the club and by the walk way to the dance floor. So we all got a free dance from some skanky chick working the pole like she's a stripper [I kid you not she probably is] she was wearing a dress and lifting up her skirt and showing the full moon like nothing... with no shame... and doing tricks on the damn thing.. go on with your bad self but damn... no class working the pole.. this isn't a strip club honey... the place is classy but the whore worked the pole... for a regular grey goose \with pineapple is $14.00... careful when you walk down to the dance floor you WILL SLIP AND FALL [which my cousin did] AND GOT UP LIKE A PRO LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED... they have multiple bars and a nice pool areas.. check this place out though... its a nice spot..,3,2,2

We went to the pool party on JULY 4th. If your a dude get there early. Not talking like 2-3 hours early, probably more like an hour or 30 minutes before the door opens. I know, even that may sound like a hassle but trust me, its well worth it! Also, call ahead and ask what event is going  on that night, some nights are regular dress nights and some are pool party night so the dress attire is different depending on the night. 

We got there about an hour early so there was only about 20-30 people in line,we were so worried about dress code becuase i heard two different things, but luckily we still got in! When  we first got it it was still early probably about nine. It looked super classy and a bit intimidating. My friend and i had been drinking since about 10am and we had a conversation with some other dudes who were waiting along too. at this time no one was in the pool yet. fast forward 2 hours. the music started picking up and more and more people started to come in. for every dude there were probably 3-4 women that would follow. had a couple more drinks which was just enough to get me to take my clothes off. down to swim trunks at least. By then the music was bumping and the pool was filled with beautiful, drunk people just like me. Maybe it was the alcohol but everyone around seemed so friendly and there was no shame in initiating conversation. 

The atmosphere is super cool. ESPECIALLY on pool nights! everyone there is super friendly and there's no reason that you shouldn't be able to make new friends there! You can either be the dude walking around and meeting people or swimming around in the pool tossing around the beach balls after a few drinks! 

i dont remember if there was a food menu, i was too busy meeting people and hanging out in the pool but thats an excuse to go back again next time :D

I had my first White Russian here and the one back home in Cali did not taste the same at all. My girlfriends and I would have to agree on this. 
My friend had someone buying her a drink so she got the Tokyo Tea because she wanted to get hammered fast. We all hate that drink because it's pretty strong. But dude, XS did it right once again. They make THE best Toyko Tea ever. It really is one of most dreadful drink but here, they make me crave it!

It's a great club to go to, a lot of GQ guys for us girls, good music and perfect for summer. XS hosts 'Night swim' every Sundays too as well, so make sure you come here in your swim gear!  I come here every single time I visit Vegas which is very often. See you during EDC weekend! ;D",3,4,3

Entry is 25 for ladies, 35 for men I believe.  We bought our tickets online so with service charge it came out to 30 and 40 which was fine by me because we waited in a separate line the first night that seemed to be faster (we arrived around 10:30).  In total we probably waited 15 minutes in the line and Avicci was on that night, not too bad of a wait if you ask me.  The second night my boyfriend and I decided to go a bit later around 12 because we didn't want to wait forever for Steve Angello to go on and we were let right to the front of the line! We had bought our tickets before, like I said, and we were super dressy which shockingly this time on my trip to Vegas is something I noticed that was missing.  Not a lot of the people were overly dressed up like my bf and I.  Really strange, I guess it's cool to know I can go in dressed a little more lax, but eh if you're at a club you should be wearing heels just like the rest of us in pain! 

Drinks are pretty expensive, but that's a given.  I got a Budweiser for the bf and a water for myself and it came out to 19 bucks.  I asked the waitress twice for a GLASS of water and with an attitude she handed me a Fiji bottled water.

So we had a  table facing the dancefloor, but outside next to the pool area. We had a great view of all the dancing and easy access to the pool for later on when we were drunkenly dancing in it. The waitress never stopped refilling our drinks and I never lost my buzz!

So four bottles of Belvedere later, my family and I were done at 3 AM. There were many danceoffs, Milfs chasing my brother, and random lapdances (I only witnessed them).

XS is huge, boasts strong drinks, a large dance floor, and a myriad of different groups of people, all of whom are fun to watch and make fun of.

We got there early because the line gets INSANE. So unless you're on the guest list, which btw, they didn't have on the Saturday night we were there, make it a point to be timely. Don't worry about being the first ones there; the club fills up very quickly. 

If you're willing to spend a shit load of money, they have ample bottle service areas. There's bed after bed, lounge after lounge, table after table and all in prime locations. My friends and I opted the cheaper route: standing.

The only complaint I have is that the dance floor got so packed that you literally couldn't breathe. In my opinion, it's too small for how large a venue it is. It was just impossible to enjoy myself when I was repeatedly slammed in to, stepped and spilled on, even wasted it was unbearable.

Rachel is a one-stop shop when it comes to promoters, and we've worked with many of them over the years... you just give her the list of clubs\/pool parties you want to go to, and she takes care of them all! (Or knows the best people who can)

I went with a 14-girl bachelorette party last weekend, and every single one of the girls said it was the best time they've ever had in Vegas! Most importantly, the Bachelorette sent a txt afterwards conveying her ""deepest gratitude for planning and executing on the most amazing weekend of my life!!... I am having serious post vacation depression now!!"". I mean, what more could a friend want for her bachelorette?!!  Several of us have been to countless Vegas [bachelorette or other] parties over the past years together, and they were all fun & awesome, but this last one was over the top... and I have Rachel to thank for helping us get there ;DDD

She made sure we were taken care of at all the other pools & clubs we wanted to go to, outside of Encore's XS & Beach Club, because she has connections with other rave-worthy promoters at each hotel...  Rachel herself goes above & beyond to make sure the other promoters she sets you up with are equally as conscientious as she is, and she'll even check in to make sure they're on top of taking care of you!! 

A couple weeks before the trip, I texted Rach & asked her to put us on lists for several places.  She & her promoter contacts were able to get us free drinks at all places, upon entrance: Tao beach & club, Marquee, XS, and Encore Beach Club... They were even able to get us a free no minimum day bed at Marquee during a major event! People pay over $1200 for these! 

Advice:  follow each promoters' instructions (i.e show up with your group on time to clubs & pools) and stay in communication with them (i.e let them know if your group size goes down or up). They set everything up so you can make the most of your time (and $$$) in vegas, but it's up to you to seize the opportunity ;) 

About XS... (you know someone's customer service is so good, when you can't stop raving about them vs the actual venue haha)... but seriously, what an amazing place.  We chose to go on Saturday night to see Zedd, and it was sooo gooood! I recommend dancing in the outside area by the pool- the acoustics were awesome, you had a nice breeze, and could always cool your feet off in the water (which saved me from my heels!).  What can I say about XS, other than you'd have to experience for yourself.  We had so much fun, we danced non-stop from 11pm-6am and didn't even realize it! I had to literally be pulled away by my friends. And I honestly think the place makes everyone so happy- I was only able to meet the nicest, most positive fun peeps throughout my whole night there (even in the long bathroom lines!).  What a memorable time, despite all the alcohol ;p  

I absolutely recommend all the above!!!",8,6,3

Please note that I spent the week in Vegas (not weekend)!

THIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL. And I love how the Grandview (time share) had hook ups to this place. Complimentary admission for guys and girls! So if you're staying at a time share (and especially if it's the Grandview... hit up their front desk for hookups! They're free!!) The wait in line was probably 15-20 minutes which wasn't bad. We were in the back of the line too.

Emphasis on beautiful. So many colors, dance floor was big enough, the outside was open but not as open as it would be on the weekends... also beautiful. Anyway around 11 the club was poppin'! As in I actually had room to dance! Sure you have the few bumps from people coming from outside and vice versa to get air, but other than that, just enough space to dance!

Drinks are expensive, yeah. I bought my cousin an adios for $16. After that he made friends with bottle service VIP people while I danced with many guys to get many free drinks. That's how it's done.

Overall, place is beautiful. Yeah, I already said that. Definitely my favorite nightclub in Vegas! I want to go baaaaack!!!",2,3,2

We went last Sunday to the XS Sunday Night Swim and that was amazing!!! Where else can you seriously swim at 3am with a sick ass DJ spinning house music? DO NOT MISS XS on Sunday nights!!! The entire inside is closed down so all of the VIP tables are outside. We almost purchased bottle service and are so glad that we didn't b\/c you can sit at any of the tables as long as they aren't already reserved or as long as a party doesn't purchase that table. We had a fat day bed right in front of the pool all night for no charge.  :)   Seriously, us ladies in our 4inch heels couldn't have been happier! 

Definitely try and hook up with a promoter. We had 3 guys and 3 girls and we didn't pay a penny to get in. Drink prices are actually CHEAP for Vegas! I ordered a Malibu\/Diet and it was only $12. Hey that is a welcome change from crappy clubs like Haze charging $19! I would definitely listen to all of the reviews and arrive early. We got there about 10pm and there were only 20 or so people in front of us. 

Whatever you do, DO NOT miss XS!!!!!! And I highly highly highly recommend going on a Sunday night if you can. Definitely dress in swim attire... people were kind of looking at the guys in our group like ""These damn tools are trying to get into a pimp club in LV in boardshorts.... idiots!"", but they were definitely jealous later! LOL!

Well some people know, but they're either a thousand miles away in California or dead so my secret is safe for now.

Ever since my senior year of college, XS has been THE go-to nightclub for me in Vegas. You can't beat the gorgeous layout with it's plush seating, high quality stripper poles, tall ceilings, state of the art lights, and large dance floor. I also love that in the warmer months, the club's back wall opens out onto the beautiful pool which comes complete with beds, tables, and private cabanas. Of course, the bars are huge and full of overpriced quality. The DJ is always top notch playing the best mixes. The go-go dancers are always hot and have the sexiest outfits on that I want to steal off their shaking bodies. 

Now granted I am a girl... er, woman (some might even say attractive woman), so I am able to get a lot of things that many people can't. Women, listen up: make friends with promoters to get you out of the ridiculously long line that starts at 10 o'clock and get you in for free. Actually, just make ""friends"" with anyone that can get you into the club without waiting whether it be promoters or rich married men who want to feel young standing next to you or Ryan Seacrest. It doesn't really matter! It's Vegas. Because XS is so big, you can ditch them once you're inside. It sounds harsh, but they know what's up. You're not obligated to hangout with a stranger just because they expedited your entrance... Please. Drinks on the other hand is a different story since like any club in Vegas, drink prices are more ridiculous than a strip club in New York! Make nice conversation and only have a drink if they give you the option. Don't bogart their $500 bottle otherwise you'll look like a lush and some other not so nice words. Men, just pray that you'll get in eventually and be prepared to stuff some Benjamins in somebody's pocket the rest of the night.


On an interesting yet fun side note, I heard there's a $10,000 drink option at XS that comes with a cocktail and a strand of black pearls. I wonder how many lucky girls have ended up with a black pearl necklace after a night here...",3,2,2

Great beats and decent drinks. Basics for any club to be worth going to more than once. The reason that I truly cannot stand this club is just how pretentious the staff is. Its exhausting to deal with the attitude, odd sense of entitlement to say rude things to clients, and flat out lies some waiters give customers. This last time we got bottle service and it was truly a waste. The waiter was terrible, spilled a beverage all over my friends crotch who was sitting while it happened and instead of offering a real apology, comes back with a napkin towel. The bouncers wouldn't allow us back into our table area (oddly being that it was already rammed with NON table paying club goers) and demanded what our table number was. Being yelled at and ignored when you try to tell him its the second table from him with the obvious girls waiving at me was just the icing on the cake. My husband has to fetch me and the bouncer had the balls to say that I didn't need so much attitude. This happened 2x that night to myself, and everyone the girls who tried to god forbid use the restroom. Funny thing, the table number was never given to us until I had to ask it from the waiter. 

XS needs to get their act together, be more organized, and know you can have an awesome club if customer service standards were a priority. I know there are some real jerks that party at clubs in Vegas and they must get their fair share. But they absolutely cannot treat people like this.

The place is notoriously hard to get into on the weekends unless you have bottle service, you're on the guest list, or a Nevada local.  Big groups of dudes won't get in while ladies always have priority.   

Listen carefully if you want to get in.  Line up at 1030pm.   You may get angry seeing all of these people parade ahead of you after waiting an hour, but do not despair.
Whatever you do...do not grease the guys in the suits unless you absolutely have to. They open up the line to general admission at 1145-1230.   

Once you get inside, you'll be greeted by the sickest sculpture mankind has ever created.  The staircase features bodies wrapped in gold paint coming out of the walls.  

When you enter the club, you'll see a large dance floor surrounded by VIP tables.   If you walk go the back, XS opens into a massive pool area with an island that has blackjack and craps tables.  

What's nice about XS is that while it can get packed, there's always room to move. This place easily rages until 5AM.  Beware the 10 dollar bud lite's inside.  They cost 8 dollars in the pool area.   Also, the girls walking around with shots in test tubes are  a good deal (12 dollars for high end stuff).

We had checked their website and it said on Fridays it was $30 for men and $20 for woman, when we got there they said It was $35 for men and $25 for woman. That's not even the worse part of it, I really didn't care and wasn't going to argue about it. The bad part is, the line was so short and in fact, there was only 8 people ahead of us and it took us over an hour before they let us in. The Gate keeper I would call him came over and told us if we wanted to tip the host $20 per male they would let us in right now and at this point there was only 4 people in front of us. So if we paid this extra $20, we would be @ $430 instead of $310 just to get in the front door. Then at there desertion, they would let people go straight in with no wait or maybe they just had more money than our group and could pay the $'s needed to skip the line. The good part is, that once we got in we spent over $1,000 in drinks and had a blast. The sad part is I would never go back to this club because of there greed. I mean really, you would think that they would be happy you picked their Club for a special night for our daughters 21st and that we traveled all the way from California. When I told the Gate Keeper that it was my daughters 21st, he didn't even seem to care one bit. When we go to Las Vegas for my next daughters 21st, I will make sure if we go to this Club again we contact someone there that actually appreciates your business.

Maybe because I'm a girl, or because I got free drinks and a VIP spot at the owner's table you can say I'm a little biased but XS was all the fun everyone has said it to be. 

It looks exactly like Tryst but 10x bigger and an outdoor pool and hot tub. It was $20 for girls to get in and $30 for guys.. Drinks were quite expensive, the guys we went with ended up paying almost $20 for a single cocktail. 

Gogo dancers are cute, guys who worked the front door were even cuter and the bouncers were funny and sweet. My girlfriends and I got hooked up with the owners of the club's table and were treated extra special with bottle service.. which included endless tasty shots, fiji water and cranberry vodka drinks. 

We were at XS for hours and though the music playlist was pretty good, I ended up hearing songs over and over again because they replayed it..They should work on that. Other than that, no complaints at all. We went on a Friday and the club was packed at midnight. The dancefloor had absolutely no room to get down and dirty so good thing they have the outdoor area so you can get some air.

I've been twice: the first time on Saturday during Memorial weekend and the second time on a Monday during spring break. Both were great experiences.

On Memorial day weekend, OF COURSE it was crraaaazy! My two girlfriends and I got there late, and the line was endless. They were barely letting people in! Luckily we spotted some guys we knew at the front of the line. I think one of them tipped the bouncer A LOT to let us cut. And unfortunately we still had to pay the $20 cover for girls...which I suppose we couldn't avoid for such a weekend.

Mondays are Industry nights, so the crowd is a bit different (it was a mix of young and old). Bf and I were placed on the guest list, which I believed to be free cover and no wait. We did get in for free, and 3 free drink passes (drinks up to $20 each), but we had to wait in the regular line. Lucky for us we got there around 10:30pm and the wait was only about half an hour or so. I noticed that couples who were on the guest list had to wait, while groups of all girls, guest list or not, got to walk right past us.

What I LOVE about XS is that it's half indoor nightclub and half outdoor pool. Hence you get plenty of fresh air (hard to come by in a crowded club!). Sadly there's only one dance floor and it's not that big, but luckily it's inside right in front of the pool. 

The first time I was there the pool area was open. We took our heels off and danced barefoot in the water. SO REFRESHING, especially after a long night in super high heels. It was my favorite part of the night. EVERY club should have this! I wish they didn't seal off the pool Monday nights.

He even contacted us the following day to follow up about our visit. Our waitress and waitstaff were very personable and attentive. The security for the VIP section was amazing as well. The club was packed so we were escorted through the crowds to the restrooms throughout the night and to the door when we were ready to leave. The prices were a bit steep, though it was expected as it was New Year's Eve. The only somewhat annoying thing was that apparently coat check closed or filled up long before midnight, so every time my girlfriend and I left our men at the table alone, we returned to girls asking them if they could leave their coats and purses at the table lol. Smart girls ;) Anyway, the headliner was great, the countdown was awesome, and the party in general was such a blast. Our table was equipped with NYE top-hats, tiaras, noise makers, etc. They even gave giant color-changing foam glow sticks to just about everyone for the countdown. It was an unforgettable night!

The hottest spot in Vegas at the moment! Beautiful club with beautiful people. Goregous pool outside that you can stick your feet in. Plenty of tables for bottle service, good drinks.

CONS:
The lines are super long, so early arrival is suggested..We went during the pacman-cotto fight..worst idea ever, around midnight, all the celebrities started to roll in (Diddy, Mario Lopez, Jermaine Dupri, Mayweather) and what comes with celebreties??? The Ridiculously LARGE crowds...it was so crowded on the dance floor that we didn't even need to walk, the crowd was just shifting us from left to right.

The Bouncers\/ guys working the door are actually going to treat you like a human being, and as a regular (albeit well-dress and at least average looking) dude I got in without bringing a trove of 19 year old sorority girls.

I would not recommend rolling in as a large group of guys, but at some clubs the doormen are just assholes about that kind of thing. The crew working the lines at XS understand that the line\/wait situation is part of your night and it is their job not to fuck that up if they can avoid it.

The women inside on a random Monday night were also, quite on point. Maybe L.A. has desensitized me, but I didn't find anyone to be stuck up or feeling themselves a little too much - which happens all the time in clubs.

Drinks are expensive of course, but that's why you have friends who know promoters with free drink cards. Make sure you still tip the bartender though. I easily got my drink from the bar outside.

Beautiful decor and plenty of shallow pools to dance in and edges to sit on if you don't have a table. Long wait for a drink but it was a Saturday night in Vegas and with free drink tickets being given to girls I can understand the wait. My gripe with this club was that once I had checked out the outside I had gone to go into the actual club itself only to be told that it was an additional $25 dollars to go into the club otherwise only outside pool access was allowed. I'm not sure if this was because this is the norm, guest list entry, or because it was a crowded Saturday night (Skrillex was DJ'ing). Clearly capacity wasn't an issue since if you were willing to pay you could have gone in. I don't mean to sound pretentious when I say this but I have never paid to get into a club in Vegas in general let alone pay to go into a part of a club I was already inside of.

(This review is more of a heads up so you dont make the same mistakes I did) 

Went with my girl and found it to be a typical overpriced club, but most clubs are overpriced in general (especially in Vegas) but XS purposely makes you wait in line for an hour+ so the bouncers could bargain a deal of paying $10-30 over the $55 cover ($35 for women).  When you walk in the place isnt very crowded at all and you realize the line to get in is a line of sheeple being extorted to get in earlier. 

The outside area is nice, better than most clubs I suppose (Dont club too much these days), but not worth the extortion fees.  Come prepared! The drinks are horribly small, (a long island is $17, while a bottled domestic beer is $11+ (like we are talking 6oz mixed drinks).  Most women there are promoters so expect the dance floor to be a bit of a dude fest.  If you got lots of money, you're not reading this review or you work for the club and are here to call me a cheap bastard.

If you're there with a big group of ladies, your wait may not be as long. We went around 11PM and were led right to the front. The cover for guys that night was $100! Insane.

**********************DO NOT BOOK  YOUR PROMOTER THROUGH ALLEN RAY********************** !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I gotta do my job in spreading awareness about shady promoters.  We chose to go through him although we had other promoters because he's good friends with my friend and we thought he would treat us well.  He made us wait for about an hour to meet him in the front, we were so confused and didn't know what to do.  He was so hard to get in contact with.  He charged us $80 from our group for ""cover charge"" when there was a guest list, which I later found out was for his own personal table with his friends!!!!  I've NEVER heard of a promoter do that before and I was enraged.  That is unacceptable and totally wrong.  Do yourselves a favor, find another promoter who will get you in with no wait, no cover charge.  I still can't believe how shady he is.  SMH.",14,6,4

My husband who HATES clubs will go here willingly (that says A LOT).  The thing that makes XS so great for me is the pool area. When I went the inside was packed and you could barely move on the dance floor. I like a packed place but this was a bit too much in my opinion. If Vegas clubs are your thing though then there you go! No need to read further. 

If you walk past that and go outside there is a ton of space, even on a Friday or Saturday. Everyone is hovering at one of the bars or inside so you have all the room you want to stand at a table or lounge on one of the poolside beds (no bottles required, that's right you can sit down in a club in Vegas for free!!). I tend to like places where you can sit outside and lounge and am amazed to have found that in a club, especially in a club in Vegas.

There are also passes for Tryst and Blush. They are near the cashier, next to the carousel of key chains. 

We stood in the VIP line but I think that was for parties who reserved tables because those people were attended to first.

Why do I like XS so much? hmmm that's tough... maybe it's because they have unpretentious bouncers who actually try to move the line as quickly as possible and get people inside, or it could be the amazingly spacious and stunning indoor and outdoor areas which make every other club in Vegas seem cramped (except for Pure), or is it the four large bars which make getting a drink little less stressful (2 indoor and 2, larger, outdoor bars), or is it the nice mix of hip hop, house and trance, or maybe it's because they actually have blackjack and craps INSIDE so there's no excuse for my gamblaholic friends not to go clubbin. Eh I don't really know, sometimes I think I like XS so much just because the place is so symmetrical.

so my friend and i jump up on the back of one of the banquets to get a look at the scene from above.. and hello VIEW, this club is insanely beautiful looked at from above. the massive crowd on the dance floor being illuminated in interchanging colors (and while i thought the lighting on the dance floor was a tad too bright, it was a perfectly sultry level of dimness throughout the rest of the club); silver confetti spontaneously erupting from a birthday party celebration next to you, calvin harris's infectious sound vibrating throughout the room- it's just what you imagine a party in vegas should look and sound like- my bar is high, and this doesn't disappoint. spectacular is the word that comes to mind to describe a snapshot image of a saturday night here.

couple this with the fact that i ended up serendipitously looking down and spotting a high school friend i hadn't seen in nearly a decade who graciously entertained us at his table- and you've got yourself a proper vegas night.

We got bottle service in a pool side cabana which was nicely heated during the winter months. The cabana has a curtain in front of it which can be closed for privacy, so I thought. I closed it at the urging of my club mates and within seconds, a gruff security guard came by, opened it and informed us that we weren't allowed to close it.

This pissed me off. I mean, we DID have bottle service and it WAS in a cabana that DID have a curtain that could be closed. Not to mention, it WAS Vegas. So I closed it just about a foot on each side when he turned his back. He came back and opened it again. I repeated this one more time until he told me he'd kick us out if we shut it at all again.

It's gotten better since I last partied at this club. Celebrated a few birthdays and a couple bachelorette parties . The dj is now in between indoor and outdoor -- loud enough for the entire venue.

Back then they had separate DJ's -- which is probably better since they played different types of music. Now i think the clubs cater to house\/edm music. Its ok, not much of a fan when its played alll night long -- beat starts to sound the same.

We paid the cover  (30 for me, 20 for the girl) and got into the club in literally two minutes from the time we walked up to the front.  This place was huge, and looked incredible from the second you walk towards the end of the main hallway and look out.  It almost has a tropical theme kind of feel going...but yes, great energy inside the club.  However, the place was INSANELY crowded.  Literally booty to booty and breast to breast in this place.  It takes like 15 minutes just to get from one side of the club to another side of the club.  I can't recall how many boobs, butts, and other body parts collided against me during this mad scramble for the other side of the club.  We could not find our friends table, so we went back out (another round of collisions and moving .0000005 mph).  My friend then called me and said he would meet me in the front, so the fun began all over again.  I saw him hitting on tons of girls on the way back to the table.  Freaking, arms around them, talking, everything.  At the table, there was good and bad.  Good- GOGO dance floor right in front of us.  BAD- Ghetto hoochy big girl squad invaded the dance floor in front of us. It was just an awful sight, and I honestly kept on looking behind me because I did NOT want to see what was in front of me. After more than enough of that visual torture, we went outside to look around the outdoor area and the cabanas.  Now the outdoor area was way less crowded, and seemed really chill.  I could see myself coming back and hanging there, but definitely not indoors.  This is a really subjective review, as I personally don't like being jampacked with hardly any room to manuever whatsoever when I'm at a club, or anywhere for that matter.

The venue is nothing short of amazing. The pool area is stunning (as you can tell from the gazillion photos here on Yelp) and inside, there's plenty'a pole strategically placed for matters of dance. Be forewarned, the bartenders make stiff drinks. A glass full of vodka with a measly splash of cran? Oh my, one will last you for a while --- not that I'm complaining ;). Seeing as how cocktails were free for us ladies, we tipped our mixologists accordingly... as should you!

Oh, and of course the music was on point (house btw, if that was any surprise to you). The best part? Random star DJs popping through. You know *casual shrug.* Just 'cause. DJ Chuckie decided to show up and please believe this little girl made her way up to the front to take full advantage of the experience all the while dance off those liquid calories. It doesn't hurt that you're surrounded by beautiful people either!

XS falls just short of 5 stars for me, though, because I swear the carpet area by the bar REEKS of too many spilled drinks and possibly a couple lost bouts with vomit. I really think they should look into replacing it and doing it soon. Until then, breathe through your mouth when visiting the bar or bat your eyelashes at that attractive gentleman staring back at you with bottle service X] Yep.

But then we all got texts from the guys that they can't get in? Even with their ALL-ACCESS tickets. So then we spent almost 1.5 hours standing there trying to sort it out with the bouncer\/security guard dude at the entrance. We asked to talk to someone in charge since this is a mixed up.

I'm on the wagon.  

But back to XS.

XS is everything I could want in a club.  If you're a fun-loving, club hopping, all-night dancing, drink your friends under the table sort then that might sound like some kind of indictment on the place, but hear me out. XS is the kind of place that you can only find in Las Vegas. Why? Because it's the kind of club that you can only find in the desert. It's a real life oasis. And that's what makes it magical.  

Getting in is a nightmare. You have to have some kind of promoter friend and then your promoter friend has to be in one of the top echelons of promoter friends if you want all access. But we did manage to get in. We were in a big group of girls and turns out we knew someone who knew someone.  

I absolutely loved the outdoor seating surrounding the pool. The club is stunning. The poolside bar wasn't TOO crowded. I was with a bachelorette party (shocking I know) and we crashed a bachelor party with some guys we ran into who we knew from back home (small world!) and ended up with bottle service on our own personal pool side sofas.  Divine.

It was a breezy and beautiful night, the music wasn't too loud. Folks were letting loose and losing clothes in the pool (no one in my party of course). There was dancing. It was just a wonderful experience. Even for an old lady like me. :-) If you're in Vegas, follow the mirage. It's real. It's an oasis. It's XS.",2,2,2

And it really was! I had so much fun from 10:30-3:30 it honestly only felt like we were there for 2 hours.
The music was on point! Diplo on mad decent Mondays slapped so hard. He's a great dj!

Of course, the fact that i knew 60+ people there that night didnt make it less interesting.

byt the time i got in and got a few shots in,  this magical place came to life even more. i dont know if it was the way it opened out from a small hallways to a dance floor lounge area to a poolside bar and lounging area that made this experience so epic. but when i lost my friends for 2-3 hrs and my memory, i managed to still say i had an amazing time. the amount of bar space and moving around area was a big addition to the great experience. meaning. i could get drinks faster.

theres a long line with strict security so dont even try to cut. but dont worry. everyone who can get in, gets in.

i miss my horse stamp. =[ ... and my dignity. i'm pretty sure it went away with my funds. but its okay, it was all worth it. i will say. take a cab to and from here. its quite a trek.

It's just a trendy place for people to waste money. I've gone here multiple times to a four star experience. They're really pretentious, and the experience has almost matched the arrogance. However, that was before I met the worst server ever.

July 4th, 2010, I had a female server at our cabana who had zero customer service sense. I disliked her attitude so much that I'm dropping my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars (luckily there were some good people and music, or it'd be a definite single star). To summarize her, she was a really tall (6'2"" in heels) brunette with a deep tan and a...bitch shield? What??

We were being kind to her and none of us were flirting with her. There was really no explanation for her attitude. Was she wanting one of us to hit on her (because immature girls will do that sometimes to get the desired response)? It wouldn't surprise me since there were a lot of good-looking guys in our crew. 

It was funny, there was this mirror at the back of our cabana, and she'd walk in staring straight at herself until the very last second. Hah. This kind of service is -not- okay when we're throwing down hundreds of dollars. We deserve more than another piece of self-absorbed eye candy -- a dime a dozen in Vegas.

I have been to many clubs through the years, including a couple in Vegas. I wanted to stay and gorge myself at the buffet then lose more money at the tables, but decided to go at the end. The line was long, especially on a Sunday night. The line felt like waiting for a ride at Disneyland, but with large groups of girls having instant fastpasses. While in line, I watched the many TV screens showing past DJs performing including Steve Aoki and Deadmau5, and it looked awesome. Once we got to the front, the girls were free and got free drink cards, while the guys paid $20 - $30. 

I have to admit, I was impressed with the layout of the club. A nice stage and dance floor, two huge bars, and tables and poles everywhere. I also noticed how clear and clean the sound system is. Perfect balance of treble and bass, enough to enjoy the music and still carry a conversation. The sound was so good that I can hear the imperfections from DJ who gives a damn that was performing that night. Only two hip-hop songs the whole night, but whatever. 

Expect to spend a lot on drinks. Shots of goose were around $15, seemingly lower when bought in multiples. The gogo dancers that brought shots around are also dangerous to the wallet, but so convenient especially when the bar area gets too crowded. Speaking of gogo dancers, it must been the first night for one on the stage since it was probably the most awkward and ugliest dances I had seen.

What I enjoyed the most is the outdoor area by the pool. Heated lamps were on, plenty of space, music sounding good, and fresh air. I also noticed that the crowd is awesome and different than those in the LA scene. I was able meet and get to know new people.

Yup, I got bottle service at a night club with my freaking parents. The night had the potential to be a disaster, but it went off surprisingly well. 

We decided on one of the outdoor tables\/cabanas on the 2nd floor. You could still hear the music blaring and still felt very much a part of the action, but you could actually speak to someone in your party if you wanted to and it wasn't crowded! The 2nd floor has it's own bathroom as well that never had lines. You could watch the masses of people and the crazy debauchery that goes on, but you never felt cramped. This was true VIP living my friends. Some may prefer to have a table in the middle of the club, but when clubbing with your parents I don't recommend this! 

Bottles were $500 or so each, not a surprise. I can say the service was spectacular, and we weren't jacked around in the slightest.

If you're planning on going to XS, proceed with caution. Bouncers are super strict with IDs: they catch all fakes (ID goes through multiple bouncers), and they'll turn you away if they don't believe your picture looks exactly like you (My girl friend was turned away after using her passport, she took the picture a couple years ago and the bouncers didn't believe it was her. They even didn't give her a chance to give other proof of her identity [credit cards, school IDs, anything] How ironic that the same passport that's good enough for US Customs, isn't good enough for the bouncers at XS).

Second, false advertisement. Some of these promoters like to say\/act like entrance is free for girls AND guys as long as you enter at a certain time. Not always. Last time we went girls got in free, and there was a cover charge for $40 per guy. 

Why would you pay $40 cover fee plus $20 for their drinks inside when you can go to other clubs for free AND get a free drink card from the girls in your group?

XS is by far the most beautiful and stunning club I've ever partied at.  This is comparing all the clubs I've been to in Vegas, from the Bay, and all the way down to L.A.  The amount of detail was highly thought out and nothing was left untouched, which help make XS simply amazing and unreal.  Steve Wynn has truly outdone himself with this club.

The club itself is huge and extremely luxurious.  Sexy curvy golden female figures are portrayed throughout the club in very good taste.  A huge rotating chandelier helps set the mood and highlight the dance floor.  Stripper poles are also staged all over the club, which helps intensify the sex appeal.  Similar to Wynn's Tryst, there is a huge poolside outdoor area, a perfect spot to cool down or catch some fresh air.  Though there is no waterfall, the outdoor area is much larger and elegant with plenty of seating & tables outside. One of the coolest things about the outside area is there are also gambling tables, mostly consisting of blackjack tables.

My only complaint regarding the club I experienced was the music.  First off, I didn't like the location of the DJ booth, which is located all the way in the back and is very hidden.  I spent a few minutes trying to figure out if there was a live DJ or if they were playing random cds.  Granted that we went on a Sunday night, but the music was horrible at best.  The transition between songs was way off and the selection of music was highly suspect and sucked. I know me and my friend couldn't have been the only people feeling this way with the music, because when I looked at other people dancing I noticed at times they would stop\/pause as well.

Summary: Looks alone club XS is visual eye candy 5+ stars, but the substance (music\/DJ) is only 1 star at best. I think I have to try another night because a few people mentioned the music was good on Friday and Saturday night. I hate to rate this place this low because I really liked the place, it's just I wasn't feeling the music and that's a big part of the experience.",16,5,13

I went with a group of friends. One of my friends had a connection with a promoter so we didn't have to wait in line, and got free drink tickets (for the females only). When we got in, there was a beautiful pool and it was beautifully lit. The outside was very loungey (though hot). However, we thought we were going to a club. Apparently you had to pay an extra $35 (for women), $45 for men, to get into the dance floor area.  So we just stayed outside. But, they didn't play loungey music to go along with the loungey atmosphere, but played the DJ dance floor music instead. So there was this weird mix of people sitting around like you would at a lounge, and people wanting to dance and get into it like on a crowded dance floor. XS should just commit to one or the other, don't mix both because that's weird and messes up the vibe. 

If you're single, lots of sexy men & women to dance with\/oogle at (is it creepy if a woman says that? probably yes).",4,2,1

I am only giving this place a 5 - stars just because of one person: Breeze (I am sorry if I spelled your name incorrectly ), who provided a stellar service and made our night, otherwise I wouldn't even given one star to the whole experience. 

0 STARS - We reserved a table at XS a month prior and when we arrived at the club, we were told that we have to wait until a ""host"" can take us to our table. After waiting for more than an hour, we were still in the line in a tiny room with hundreds of other people. My party consisted of 4 girls and when you pay $$$$$ for a table you expect amazing customer service. Well, my expectations were short - lived: we had to stand in the line and ""beg"" extremely rude and ignorant ""hosts"" to take us to our table. After becoming frustrated we decided to leave.

5 STARS - While we were exiting that tiny room I accidentally bumped in into a gentleman (he was one of the employees) who was standing at the door. I told him the reason we were living and to my biggest surprise he offered to take us to our table. For a minute I did not believe what he said because of how disappointed I was with the whole experience inside; however, within 5 minutes we were at our table enjoying ourselves. 

I want to thank you Breeze for your service - you are amazing and others should definitely learn from you ! Customer service is the most important aspect of any business and I guess you are one of the very few who provides it at XS.",0,0,0

I met some friends here that were staying at the Wynn. We tried to get a table and were told it was min. $1500 outside, $2000 inside. We said ok, but then several minutes later were informed the tables were sold out. So why did we even have this discussion? Oddly enough we saw several tables that were empty. Hmmm... Our group consisted of 5 girls, 3 guys. We ended up paying to bypass the line: $100 for guys, $50 for girls $550 total. We were let in after a short wait. The club was packed and it had only just opened. We made our way outside just so we could have some room.

The center bar outdoors was ridiculous! We waited forever just to be waited on, getting annoyed that the people who were behind us kept squeezing their way to the front and getting helped first. The bartenders were not at all paying attention to who'd been waiting longer and were not taking orders in any sort of order. The drinks were small (much smaller than the comped drinks in the casino), and like normal Vegas, hella expensive. One round of 2 Redbull vodkas, 1 Bud Light and 2  vodka tonics was $98, and aside from the beer they were about 8oz. each! We continued to order drinks but after two rounds we started buying them from outdoor  the bar on the side which seemed a little less crowded.

The music was fantastic and made you want to dance. There was plenty of eye candy as well as people watching - several creeper dudes on their own gawking, but hey they paid to get in too right?

We finally decided to get closer to the DJ so we moved indoors which is a funny thing to say, because once we got indoors we literally could not move! Seriously! In the walkways it was a serious fire hazard waiting to happen. People packed so hard together you could have been groped or pick pocketed without ever even knowing it because their were drinks in your face, arms in your back and you moved about an inch every 30 second. NOT enjoyable at all.

It was a crowded and pricey night out but I'm sure I'll be back again. For those who are visiting Vegas, there are a ton of Clubs with lower cover to get in, a lot less crowded inside and music just as happening.",6,2,2

When I was 16, I went to Hong Kong, which is the worlds second most populated city after Mexico city.  There were people bumping into me every few feet there.  When I went to club XS, I felt like I was stuck in traffic on the freeway during peak rush hour.  At certain times, I could not even move anywhere since I was surrounded by people left and right.   I'm not talking about the dance floor, I""m talking about being outside.  Shoulder to shoulder, butt to front, I was stuck.  I couldn't even go in and out without taking the long way around.

I don't know if its like that every saturday night, but this saturday was with Calvin Harris. He was amazing.  I'm usually a shy guy when it comes to dancing, but I couldn't help but get on my feet and bust a move when he was at the turn tables.  The music was great the entire night.

The drinks were pretty pricey though.  I ordered an Adios and it was $16.  A cup of soda was around $5, as well as a water bottle.  My friends and I knew this coming in so we pre-gamed a bit before we went out here.  Its highly recommended. :)

The people here are pretty classy too.  They are put together pretty well and look great.  Its not like some sleezy local club.  What would you expect after shelling out nearly $75 just for a cover charge?  Very pretty girls and lots of good looking and interesting cats around.

Anyhow, there were also tables to gamble by the pool outside.  The pool is a european bathing place by day and a place to literally stand and chill at night.  Some people were dancing in the pool the whole time since it was so crowded everywhere.

You either have to line up extremely early, go extremely late, or know somebody to get in. Luckily this is Vegas and the clubs stay open very late so we got in an hour past midnight without much of a line at all. The layout and design is definitely nice and lives up to Vegas standards for clubs. 

At first glance, it looks exactly like Tryst with an outdoor option minus the nice waterfall. But this club is a lot larger than Tryst, which you see once you step outside. You are greeted by the dance floor when you first enter and as you go outside, there's a pool for the girls to dance without their shoes and also more bars around the back. The place is extremely well ventilated and the music was pretty good. 

While it's a nice club, I still don't think it's as extravagant inside as Tao. Since the spaces are so wide open, there's nothing really to see in terms of design. But I suppose people go to clubs for the people, not to look around at the walls. Still, ambiance accounts for how nice a club is. It also doesn't seem like they screen for creepers here.

Here's the story-

One of my girlfriends lost her phone so she had to report it. 

Strike 1: Security guard 1 refused to let us go with her to the cashier, insisting only one person can go. ""You can wait for her here. Please step inside."" Alright. 

Strike 1.5: About 5 minutes later, coat check person begins asking us to move further in because we were ""in the way"" of people entering. Oh...k? We aren't even waiting in the lane where people are walking. And we are against the wall??! We were told to wait here? K.... 

Strike 2: Security guard 2. (This man deserves all forms of derogatory terms, but I'll refrain myself on here. Also let me just tell you real quick that we had gotten here at 10 pm - it is now 3 am. And we just finished dancing to Zedd. Naturally, our feet hurt.) We were chillin' in the corner, fob squattin'. We ain't laying on the ground, looking a crazy mess, you know? He comes over and asks us to get up. And I retort, ""We are waiting for a friend."" He replies with the rudest tone, ""Well stand up! Just stand up."" Okay, Jesus. I guess we making ya'll look bad. MAAAAAAH F'ING BAD. So we stand up. And because I looked angry, he saunters back & tells us we need to relocate ourselves to the exit of the club. Ok, hi. My friend is out THERE, you want us out HERE. She is reporting a lost phone- how is she going to contact us if we can't find her? How are we supposed to meet her after? He insists we leave the club and wait on the outside. Uh. No. I told him we were told by another guard to wait here for our friend. ""I'm telling you right now the other guard was mistaken."" TF?! So we obey and move towards the exit of the club and chill there for another 10 minutes. 

They didn't let her come back in to get us. 

I ultimately marched past them after 15 min of waiting and demanded to know where she was. Guess what. 

Strike 3: THEY DIDN'T KNOW. He kept saying she was where she wasn't!!! And to add to the insult, he wouldn't direct me to her. He kept insisting she was at their lost and found turning in a report but couldn't let me know exactly where that was. And I was told to just wait for her. ""You can't go back there anyway. She will come back here to find you."" At this point, I'm livid. You are not giving me concrete information about my friend's whereabouts. She doesn't have a phone!!! It's 3 AM in Vegas where just about anything can happen. WHERE IS SHE? I'm walking around like a crazy person at this point. I went up to security guard 2 directly and told him it was unprofessional of him to give me discreet details about my friends whereabouts considering she doesn't have a phone on her and she is alone. He tells me to ""calm down."" Incredulous, I just walked away. Calm down!!?! Ok. Ok. Ok. Breathe. I storm off to talk to a hotel worker asking where their lost and found would be. Of course, that didn't help. 

I decided to contact a manager. As I was talking to another bouncer (This man was much, much more helpful! Thank you, kind sir.), security guard 2 who told me he knew where my friend was came by and saw I was essentially getting him in trouble and was like ""her friend is in G4"" or wherever the heck it was. And the guy I was talking told me, ""We will get a manager to take you directly to her."" Thanks, but no thanks. At the exact same time, we get a text from our other friends at the hotel saying our lost friend had gotten back safely. She had given up looking for us because they refused to let her back in to get us?!?! Lol, my heart rate is increasing as I'm writing this.  

When we got back, our friend told us that the black guard (security guard 2) hadn't even spoken to her. She was looking into the club after they escorted her OUT. Didn't even know who she was. 

CALM DOWN, huh?!?! She'll be back, right?!?

OK. 

Granted, this club is nice. But we will not be going again. The venue gets crowded to the point of claustrophobia. People are constantly pushing and pulling. They get great DJs to play here but it's not worth the headache. And the ending experience was completely unprofessional and very condescending. 

I was NOT intoxicated during this situation, JUST FYI.",17,9,6

XS basically says ""All Your Base Are Belong to Us"" to the other clubs, and obliterates then elevates my standard of what a club experience can be. 

You will be spoiled. There will be debauchery.  I've only been once in July and used to wonder what all the fuss was about...now I know... It is indeed fuss-worthy.

So, cover is $50 which IS a lot of money for a frikkin club, but if your staying in the Wynn\/Encore or get in touch with promoters, or are a bunch of hot Asian girls,or of course know somebody, you can skip the line and might even get admission waived. Girls work it - guys...I guess your other option is buying a bottle $$$. Luckily my friend got us to skip and we paid $40 I think.

Anyways, the crowd is gorgeous, the venue is seductive and intoxicating in more ways than one, there's gambling in the back (which amazed me! i mean gambling in a club while your getting drunk off your ass? Nice move, Encore! I mean, thats fucked up, but nice move!), the music is tight but the drinks start at $14 which adds up quickly...

If you are a baller, you will live the life here. Girls will grub off you and your cabana like there's no tomorrow. But likely you'll be kissed, then dissed and won't be missed LoL. But meeting someone genuine in Vegas? perhaps better luck at slots! Even if you're not flying sky high you will still feel like a stunner here with a few drinks in your system - the feeling of euphoria here is palpable and highly contagious.

It is GLORIOUS! It is, hands down, the largest club I have ever been in and it is decked out, which the giant inside club section and the beyond gorgeous outdoor pool, patio section it is utterly breathtaking. I think we walked through the whole things with our mouths wide open. They even had a coliseum style gazebo to gamble in and beds with canopies to sit on. 

We got hooked up on the guest list and got in no problem, no cover (both girls, and we were dressed up). So that was awesome, but then of course beer is $10 a glass. They pour your beer into a glass, leave a bunch in the bottle and then throw the bottle away. Weirdest thing ever. 

The music was awesome and it was cool that you could sit in the pool on comfy chairs, or even swim if you had thought ahead. I know we went on pool party night (Sun) so I don't know if that's always the case. 

The reason I wouldn't go here regularly is that every is pretty pretentious, very many people trying to look cool. I complimented a girl on her dress and she stone cold stared me in the face and didn't say anything. Maybe it's because I'm Canadian but that's super rude. 

Most people didn't want to talk to us but we met Canadians and some English people who were laid back and had a great time. The music just got better and better all night and it was fantastic having places to sit without having to get bottle service.

What I love about this club is the pool area where you can take your shoes off and dance in the water without guys bothering you too much.

I just wished the DJ would have played a mix of hip-hop, top 40 dance so that my friends would have danced more.

The layout and decor is just breathtaking once you walk in and then you realize that you can go outdoors to the pool area where they have bottle service, two bars, and floating seating areas in the pool!!  However, there is no barrier to stop your drunk self from falling into the pool so BEWARE.

We got in line around 8:45-9pm on a Saturday night and it doesn't take long for the line to grow.  What I like about XS is that they let people in based on their place in line, no picking 20 girls over a group of 5 guys, etc, it's pretty fair!  There's also no cuts-ies in line, try it and the purple blazered security folk will quickly march over and kick you out.  Cover for ladies is $20 and $30 for guys.

Drinks are pricy, be forewarned.  Get your stamp and leave temporarily to play penny slots and get drinks.

The bathrooms are super nice and kept very clean.  There are also tons of products for you to use to freshen up as well as candy and cigarettes if you're looking for it.

3. They have a huge pool with a shallow end where you can just dip your feet in! For us ladies with the high heels, it feels amazing to throw off our shoes and soak our feet while we continue to dance! 
4. Pool party on Sunday! (It's not always open though). But make sure that if you want to go into the pool, you wear a bathing suit because if you don't, the bouncers will kick you out!

They only allow you to stay outside and you can't go inside unless you pay. We were told by a promoter that we could just pay and cut the entrance line since we were already technically inside.

Once we got there, they told us that we had to wait 2-3 hours. The entrance line is long but only artificially. They purposely don't let anyone in until around 12 because they want you to get frustrated with the line. The shark of promoters then circle waiting for you to try and bribe them to bring you up front and they charge whatever they want for that. One guy told us to pay him $100 + entrance fees for one guy and one girl $60. Then another said $140 + $60. Crazy. 

Finally this super sketch guy came up and told us $100 for all entrance and he would walk us up the VIP line. He wanted the money up front but we weren't having it. Waited until he literally walked us in the club with all the stamps then slipped him the $100. 

Omg such a scam!!!! And the other thing is that the party really doesn't go down until 1:30am! David guetta and the epic light shows don't come on til then. 

But I gotta say, when he came on it was freaking worth all the hassle. The place was jumping off the walls insane. The music was good. The show was awesome! I figure it's like paying $50\/person for a concert which IMO isn't too bad.

The sound system is also horrible. How can a trap master like dj snake sound like he's using a bunch of phones for speakers?!?!?

I always heard great things about Tryst, but never got to go there yet, but after hearing great things about XS too, we decided to go there and I so glad I did. First of all, the setup of this club is awesome and definitely unique. I have never been to a club that is set up like an auditorium. When you walk in, there's rows of tables, and at the very front, is a huge dance floor. I also thought it was cool that at the front of the club, there's no wall, but instead, just open out to the pool area.

What makes this club great is the large size of the club. This place is huge! Also, the music was awesome - great mixes of everything including hip hop, rap, house, and trance. I definitely like the mixture of music, keeps things exciting. Also, the crowd is cool here too, everyone is dancing, having a great time. The decor here is great too - definitely makes you feel like you're in vegas and at a a grand ball of a party.

Next time I am in Vegas, XS will be one of the clubs I'll go to again for sure. Highly recommended.",7,2,6

It's your typical Vegas club you wait FOREVER in line unless you pay the bouncer $20  then you can skip the line then pay the $20-40 cover charge.

The club itself is pretty big. Nice dance floor and the people there are beautiful. Of course the drinks are stupid expensive ($12 for a mixed drink) But that's why I brought my flask in I'm not spending that much for a drink lol

Yes, I paid $50 cover for each guy on Halloween weekend, but what do you expect from the hottest club in Las Vegas! From the decor, to the sheer size of this place, there is not one thing I would change about this. When I think of how nightclubs should be like, this is what I picture.

Too sweaty on the dance floor? Just go outside to the pool area and cool off. Wanna gamble a little bit while there? No problem. Thirsty? Go to the bar or make friends with someone with bottle service.

Anyway, I had a deep cut on my finger and it kept bleeding and the guys that worked at XS went out of their way to find me a bandaid. 

There were a lot of people inside but because it's so big, I felt like I could get away from all of them if I wanted.  My friend and I danced for quite a few hours. Maybe because we're both Asian, all of the guys that approached us were Asian.  Not only were they Asian, I am convinced that the only Asian males at XS the night we were there were Korean.

From the moment you walk into the Wynn\/Encore, the hotel decor immediately grabs your attention. If you're a dude, you start checking out all the hot cocktail waitresses. 

It seems that no matter what time you get to the XS entrance, there is always a long fucking line, as if the entire homeless population in Los Angeles found out about the only shelter still serving food on Thanksgiving. 

Most clubs control the flow of people entering the club at a slow rate, so as to build up the crowd of people outside the club, leaving them in extreme anticipation and about ready to have an anxiety attacks. But who's to argue that it doesn't work? When you see a crowd of people anywhere, you want to know why. It really is an attention getter. 

After you wait in line for three fucking hours and cough up $30-40 (guys) to get in, you're greeted by the awesomeness that is XS. Before walking down the staircase onto the main floor of the club, you pause at the top and think to yourself, ""Holy shit, this club is fucking amazing."" Then you rush down the stairs to the bar and wait amidst another mob to get to the front of the bar. If you're a girl, there's a good chance you'll slip down the staircase in your high heels. I saw it more than 3 times in a span of 2 hours. 

If you're white or super Asian, this will be the best club you will have ever gone to. The majority of the time is spent banging your head, pumping your fist, and jumping up and down to the monotonous beats of techno, house, jungle, trance, and whatever other type of music you find at a massive rave fest. 

If a good time at a Vegas club for you is dancing in an imaginary box as if you were a mime, then there's no other choice than XS. If you like pushing and shoving people out of the way so you can walk out to the pool area to have a cigarette or get some fresh, cigarette-smoke infested air, then you go to XS. 

But the best part is if you're a guy (or a less-than-easy-on-the-eyes type of girl), you get to be treated like oppressed black people in the 60s. The promoters care nothing about you. That is, until they get all the hot girls inside first and slowly start leaking in guys to bull rush the bar and make their profit. If the group of people you're with is an even ratio of guys-to-girls, you're not that important. 

The promoters are idiots. Working for a dope nightclub has somehow boosted their egos. These people think they are the key to your having a good time, yet they want to do everything possible to not make that happen, like keep you waiting for hours in line and making you wait (or even turn you away) for not having pretty chicks with you. Yeah, for promoters it's a job, but standing out on the Strip and casino floor handing out your card, dishing out your BBM contact name to random, pretty girls doesn't make you a cool guy. Because you're in a nice suit, talking to strangers standing in line waiting to get into the club you work for doesn't make you a popular person. You don't have much power. If you do, it's the power to be a retard. 

To recap, if you like waiting a long time to party with hundreds of drunk and belligerent people in a massively crowded space, XS is perfect for you. If not, there's The Orleans on Tropicana, a few blocks west of the strip, with a huge bowling alley, movie theater, and fantastic courtyard cafe.",6,10,4

Located in the new Wynn extension, Encore, the club defines ""excess"" to the fullest. I'm talkin' at least 40 tables, 15 dancing poles, 6 go-go dancers, 3 fully-stocked bars, and an even ratio of hot staff--one guy, one girl per table to cater your every need. 

Now, if you know me, you know that Steve Wynn is my hero. The Wynn is by far my favorite hotel in Vegas; the architecture, décor, atmosphere, dining, boutiques, pool, day\/nightlife--the full package. And the Wynn nightclub, Tryst, is unbelievably cool. I mean...to have a damn WATERFALL up in the club? You can't get more excessive than that. 

Apparently, Steve Wynn can.

XS doesn't have a waterfall, but it does offer a massive outdoor patio area. Complete with a mote-like pool, cabanas, and a gambling section! It was freezing the night we went, so no pool action. Given how cold it was, I felt for the dealers stuck outside, but they were in cute weather-appropriate snow bunny outfits, so that was good.

Back inside, the spacious dance floor was filled to the rim. The music was Top 40's as expected, mashed up with a little house\/dance\/techno. Normally I'm put off by Vegas go-go dancers (more strip club than nightclub), but these dancers were naturally pretty and fit girls, with matching outfits that I wouldn't mind wearing myself. 

I'll definitely be back in the summertime, as I foresee tons of mischief going on in their outdoor pool. Watch out, Rehab\/Tao Beach\/Palms.",2,0,2

Here's a couple of notes:

- Dress well, it'll definitely go a long way with the crowd, don't even think about jeans.
- You WILL be leaving with confetti all over you, so just be prepared for that. 
- If you're on the dance floor, be prepared for pushing and shoving all night because it's PACKED... but it adds to the fun.
- The opening DJ sucks. Be prepared for that.

A little smaller, a little more intimate and what I believe started my liking for a lot of DJs. I highly recommend you contact a promoter so you can purchase cheaper tickets before. From what I remembered there is more than one bar. It isn't so stuffy because behind the DJ Stage is a opening for fresh air. 

One downside about this club are the lights. There isn't much a light-show going as Light but wait for it.... there is a mini pool outside that girls (guys sorry, no splashing in the water for you) can play in. Yes, that's right I said it. We can play in the water if we want. 

A lot of girls who can't handle the high heels, rest here and splash their stanky feet in here so I wouldn't recommend taking a dive. But it's a little perk for girls who come to Vegas from March-Aug.

I think that bottle service is a good thing for a glammed up place like this because just a small bottle of water is $8!! So if you go in a group of friends, I'd definitely get bottle service!

I don't know about the guy's bathroom but for ladies, there are 2 escorts to walk you to your stall, and 1 employee handing you towels.

Overall I would give this place a solid 4.8 rating.

If you're staying at Encore, be sure to just get tickets in advance through concierge. You won't have to wait in the ridiculously long line. Encore guests w\/ tickets just walk in through the re-entry line. Quick, easy, painless.

This past weekend during deadmau5 though, we couldn't leave and come back in. Bouncers told us ""it wasn't guaranteed that you'll get back in even though you're a guest here because we've reached capacity""
I JUST NEEDED TO USE THE BATHROOM! The line for the female restroom was fucking RIDICULOUS. and I must reiterate, FUCKING RIDICULOUS.  I waited FORTY MINUTES IN LINE TO GO PEE.

First of all, I really like the layout. It's one level, no stairs like Marquee. I also love their patio. I love how the pool is a circle and tables are wrapped around it. There's also a huge screen so you can see the DJ spinning from outside. The dance floor was jammed packed so it was nice to be outdoors and not sweating bullets inside. 

We met some really cool Greek Canadians and hung out with them at their table. However, this club is predominantly Asian. I didn't know that going in. Although I'm Asian, I prefer a more diverse crowd. I guess we lucked out when we found these Greek Canadians. 

The only complaint I have is the bouncers in line. This short Filipino was having a power trip. My girlfriend allegedly knocked down one of the ropes in line. He stomped over and literally yelled at her for knocking it down and didn't pick it up. She was so scared and apologized and said it was an accident, she didn't even see it. He made her walk ALL the way back in the line and walked back into our spot in line for entry. Are you kidding me?!

This place is beyond amazing. The best experience I have ever had in a club. I of course looked on Yelp to see what the reviews for this place were and browsed through some tips from people. I saw that being on ""Rachel's Guestlist"" is the best thing to do when coming here. I texted her and she got all 3 of us in for free, plus 3 drink vouchers for EACH person! My tip is to hide your drink tickets when you go to the bar and order a drink. I feel the bartenders may water down the drinks a little when they see you have those tickets and also give priority to people flashing money in their face.

The music was so damn good. They played all of the hip-hop songs I wanted them to play. The DJ really knew how to mix things up. This club plays mostly EDM but has a good variety of Top 40 and a sprinkle of popular hip-hop songs in there. The venue is gorgeous, stunning even. The lighting, the crowd, the decor is nothing short of a wonderland. I was not expecting the club to be so enormous or so spacious. 

There are pool areas where girls can soak their sore feet and just relax. There are no security guards constantly telling you to move and everyone in the club is chill and relaxed. I've also never seen so many kind girls. I received numerous compliments from beautiful girls and there was never any cattiness or dirty looks. Everyone was enjoying themselves and loving the music. 

The guys were also friendly and very respectful from what I experienced. There are alot of cool people that come here from all parts of the country. There were two DJ's that night. One of which was a favorite of mine. DJ Diplo. He played the best variety of music. He really knows what he's doing and understands the vibe of the crowd. My friend and I were amazed at how good the set list was and he knew what to play next and hit the hammer on the nail with each song he played. He also had his buddy Justin Bieber come out to perform one of the songs he produced. (A lot of celebs were here this weekend because of the Mayweather fight) I'm not a huge fan of his but the brief performance was pretty good. 

The drinks were good and well mixed. It can be hard to get a bartender's attention but if you wait there long enough someone will serve you. I loved this place so much I was actually considering lengthening my trip just so I could come back here the next night. Anytime I am in Vegas I will come here. This place is so much fun, I couldn't believe how good of a time I had here! Please check this place out! You will not regret it.",45,28,38

For guestlisters, you have to walk all the way around the hotel to get in. From there, you enter from the side, where there is a pool area, which looked all sultry. But I thought the venue was a bit weird as the DJ's back is facing the pool area. So if you're hanging in the pool area, you don't get to see the DJ. We were able to get to the dance floor, but it was a bit smaller than expected. Bar inside the dance floor was a bit tiny as well, though the one on the patio is pretty large.

Excessively big, excessively expensive, excessively packed, excessively rude bouncers, with an excessively long line to wait in.

His jackass answer was, ""There are many ways of getting in sooner, but asking isn't one of them."" (meaning, ""Shell out the dough girl, b\/c I think I'm really incredibly important even though all I do is hold a clipboard"")

Luckily, my girl had a 6-degrees of promoter separation, and we were able to cut to the front after waiting 30 minutes at the back of a line that wound down 2 hallways. 

After hesitantly parting with $20, in we went, 10 hot girls with 1 ""gay"" BFF. It was big, but so packed you couldn't move. I didn't get to enjoy the supposed pool bar or BJ tables (BlackJack, you pervs) or other opulent amenities. I instead was surrounded by sweaty ppl who elbowed you while you tried to pass by.

Dancers were pretty good, although their gold dresses weren't that flattering. (If you're going to dance like a stripper, dress like one so  I have more eye-candy to look at.)

So yea...it was aiite. 

But maybe my experience was tainted b\/c I had to babysit a 37 yr old woman who couldn't hold down her liquor...and then had to leave early b\/c she got kicked out...and then had to walk her home to the Venetian while she leaned her whole body weight on me...and then exasperatedly left her on the toilet to go back into XS an hour later.

Things have changed only slightly over the years, but XS still remains one of my favorite clubs in Vegas.

This was the hot spot to be at a couple years ago. Usually with that though, clubs would be incredibly tough to get into. This was not the case for XS; as long as you got in line early, or just waited. The nicest thing about XS is that even if you were to go early, you could just get stamped, leave, and come back without hassle when its poppin off. This is especially good if you're staying at the hotel, since you can go back up to your room and get sloshed on the cheap. Another thing I've heard you can do is buy a pre-sale entry if you're staying at the hotel so that you can just walk in; never tried it though.

Now, what's changed over the years is that now it's just not THE place to be. While the quality of the crowd is still good, it just isn't what it used to be. Seems like the females have gravitated more towards Marquee and Surrender; but that's not saying I haven't my fair share of good looking women here in recent history.

Of course, I bought that person a drink or two to pay my respect!

This club kind of of reminds me of Tryst which is at the Encore; a sister hotel of the Wynn. It's huge and it has a swimming pool inside.

Unlike the super negative experiences of some individuals, I thought XS was okay. Of course, I was there on a night that NormanD was spinning. Most people in my group were not into that type of music so they absolutely hated it. Having spent some time in Europe, I wasn't hating it, but I have to admit that NormanD was spinning some wack tunes. The system was a little grainy but it was decent enough and the pool was open since it was Swim Sunday.

What I DID like:

- Decor was awesome
- Bouncers were not militant about us sitting in an empty cabana
- Drinks were strong
- Overall, more breathing room
- Open pool...but a little dangerous for drunkies, if you ask me

What I did NOT like:
- Closed off half the club squeezing a HORDE of people into tiny quarters
- ONE bouncer in particular being an ASS about my friend sitting on a concrete ledge (really!?)
- This one isn't really a big deal but why are there so many BUSHES? that's taking up some precious standing room!
- The wack tunes

I will give XS another try, but this first experience was kinda crappy. The layout is nice, but I feel like a mere peasant with the ""nobles"" looking down on me from their gilded ledges (aka the VIP booths) from the second floor...

I have no idea how much it really is to get in but over heard it being like 40 per guy for the group in front of us. The club is amazing .. the decor and the whole set up is beautiful it is a must see.....truly beautiful 

INSIDE... Super packed!!!

Asians everywhere and I mean everywhere. Most of who are white girl wasted falling over themselves like it was their first time drinking.

The booze is expensive.. around 10 bucks a beer which isnt unbearable but shots are like 18 each .. golden rule .. pre game..

It was hardcore house all the time... I can fist pump with the best of them but my arm does get tired... switch it up ... they did switch to one song... a whitney houston song and thats just cuz she had passed away that week... but after that bam back to beating that beat.

At first, I wasn't ready to go to XS. I was in a bad mood, my feet hurt from wearing heels not meant for walking in, and I didn't want to be in a crowd full of drunk, rich, pretty people. My boyfriend ended up convincing me just to check it out, and I agreed, since I was already dressed for the evening. 

I was shocked at the price tag for just entering the club. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, since they do serve a $10,000 cocktail. But really...even while we got a discount for staying at the Wynn, the price we paid to get in would have set me back in groceries for two weeks. Yeah, I'm cheap, I will freely admit it. But then again, I shouldn't go trying to haggle my way into what is considered one of the best clubs in Vegas. 

The interior is amazing, it really is. A huge space, and even an outdoor bar with a pool. The night we went the pool was closed (it was just too cold), so i don't know what happens when it's open, but I'm sure it's fun. There are women in skimpy outfits dancing on tables and stages, and one lonely lady dancing all by her lonesome in the outdoor bar. The tables were all packed and all table service, which made me sad, because I wanted to sit down. The music, in my opinion, was good, very upbeat Top 40 stuff, which sadly, I'm addicted to. So I knew i was going to get my groove on at some point in the night but not really remember what I danced to. It's just that kind of place. 

The lines at the bar move fairly quickly. However, make sure you have your cash and credit cards handy, because a mixed drink will cost you $12. Yes, it's pricey...but that's how things are done in Vegas I guess. Again, this is coming from a girl who RARELY goes clubbing. And no, I just don't believe some vodka and cranberry juice costs $12, unless it will help me to fly...or something. 

The drinks didn't help me to fly, but I did get pretty tipsy and start dancing at any random moment I could find. This is a good time to just start people watching. You'll get everything from the random douchebags trying to pick up women, to the girls who absolutely fall for them. We didn't see anyone famous, but we did see....an Asian family (including grandma, father, and possibly son)???? Wtf? We heard this club was exclusive, but then we see this little old lady wandering around with her family doing nothing but obviously just seeing whatever they read in their guide books. It was confusing and awkward, and I don't want to judge them on having a good time, but when you expect to see beautiful people dressed to the nines to get in, anything else just seems confusing and makes you feel like you could have dressed in anything as long as you had the money to pay to get in. 

We did have fun, and when you see money getting dropped from the ceiling, it just makes you get that much more excited. Yes, you read that right. Money. From. The. Ceiling. YAY!!! Who wouldn't dance to that? The bathrooms are also nice, and that's all I have to say about that. 

In the end, my bad mood was lifted, and I realized that if any of the clubs in Chicago were as nice as this, I would first of all be broke most of the time, and second, I would be drunk every weekend, while walking home carrying my heels, like I did that night. I want to be more descriptive of everything, but I think...it's one of things you have to see and experience, if only once.

$20 entry for ladies and $30 for guys. I tried my very best at sweet talking the doorduds, to no avail. Unless you're exclusively with ladies, I can guarantee no luck on line-bypassing.

Once inside though, it's a club that will quell any second guesses about the line or fees. Dance areas are huge & music is move-inducing. XS is equipped with enough bars to nearly eliminate the bar-wait.

I have to complain about the rest of the atmosphere, and this is what makes the place 2 stars. While the inside and outside area is pretty huge, the dance floor relative to that is pretty small, and can't accommodate everyone if they all want to dance. So dance floor was packed really to the point of feeling like sardines, Kept getting bumped into by other people and getting drinks spilled. They also play the music at a volume so that the rest of the club can hear it. So if you are on the dance floor the volume is way loud. I also really had a problem with the DJ, and his music selection. He kept playing rock songs (Nirvana, Kings of Leon) and putting a techno beat behind it.

Maybe if I had to stand in line for an hour I could convince myself that XS lived up to the hype. But I didn't.

The dance floor was pretty packed so my lady friend and I did our dancing outside near the pool. I have to admit the people watching was fun, but didn't see any A or B listers when wading through the Bottle Service crowd and tables.

Transitions to new songs lacked drum loops and totally killed the mood each time moving to the next song.

BIG $ SAVING TIP: They have ins & outs. Come early enough, get stamped, go to the slots, find a waitress and get some FREE drinks! Tip her of course because you're saving so much money sitting there playing slots. The slots are really close by too.

It never gets too crowded (even with big-name DJs) and I love how you can walk around and enjoy the music outside as well as inside. The outside area is spacious. Bottle service tables are inside and outside. Near the pool there is a bar and casino table game area. There are also 2 bars inside; one on each side of the stage. The dance floor has air conditioning blasting on it so you're not likely to leave the club covered in sweat. Since the club opens up to the pool area it also never gets stuffy. The sound system is great. The lights and production value aren't on par with other Vegas clubs but the other positives make up for it. 

Guys might as well buy their tickets ahead of time. This time when I went, the pre-sale ticket line was near the entrance to Encore. You end up entering XS through the back. Other times when I have gone, the girls-only guest list line was in that spot. You do have the option to do a girls and guys guest list with a good ratio, but the line was already long at 10:30.

Home is always gonna be home! It's a testament to the club that it is still standing after 6 years and counting. But every club needs to evolve, and with that I gotta update my review to take these changes into account.

We all know XS wasn't designed to be an EDM club, but they were able to convert it to an EDM club by putting the DJ booth in between where the dance floor split from inside to outside. Except Marquee and Hakkasan raised the stakes...so yeah, XS had to upgrade their game.

And upgrade it they did! Upgraded the visual wall so that it's actually a real wall for once instead of the dinky little screens they were using. Threw up lights on the ceiling so they could use the entire ceiling as a canvass. And laser game is SUPER on point...nothing like three-way lasers crossing the dance floor.

Of course let's not forget what makes this club what it is...I don't care what other club opens up after this, I can pretty much guarantee that it won't have an outside area better than XS. I really need to come here for Sunday Nightswim one day.

Anywho, if you ever need to get on guest list here (even ratio most nights, sometimes 2:1, comes with drink tickets for ladies!) or awesome table deals, talk to my man Chris at (702) 722-8585. He's been my go-to guy for a while now and he is the man you want to know when it comes to Vegas!",14,4,5

Get inside and theres gratuitous amounts of T & A rubbing up on you because its packed like a sardine can! the DJ was on stage pumping up the crowd, beats liberating the women dancing on tables, strip pole platforms, dancefloor, and even in the pool.

I came here with the hubby on a Monday Night, unfortunately, no one told us that you could only dance in the pool on weekends. 

The music on this particular night really sucked and wasn't really anything to dance to. The dancers seemed kinda dead, especially the one girl dancing on the stage in the middle of the pool. I don't get what her purpose was but she just sorta swayed from side to side and sometimes didn't do anything but stand there. It wasn't packed at all which made it seem less fun and quite dead.

Oh well, I mean we both got in for free which was good because it was definitely not worth a cover fee if we weren't going to be able to dance in the pool. Unfortunately, it meant we stayed for less than an hour since we weren't feeling the music or the lack of much going on outside by the pool area.

So my tips would be to come here on a Fri\/Sat night and unless you wanna drop $11-13 bucks on a mixed drink or beer, have something before you come in and make sure that the pool area is open for dancing in. Also, don't forget your camera, because the photo ops here would be beautiful and it's a very nice looking club in general.

So on a stroll out Monday night, my friends and I were looking for a place to go clubbing.  After visiting two other clubs (which were closed), we found ourselves at XS.  I've heard of XS being one of the greatest clubs for the 21-ish crowd in Vegas, so I was going in with high expectations.  But what did I get?  Pure disappointment.

Let's start with the ambience. Indeed, the inside of the club is amazing.  The open-air club allows for it not to get too hot and sweaty, but it is also more prone to smoking.  The pool on the outside looked like it would be fun, but since it was a Monday night, essentially everything was closed off.  The bathrooms are nice and no wait time.

So let's skip to the bad stuff.  For me, the dj makes everything.  Even if I am with my friends, if the dj sucks, then the entire night is ruined.  For Monday night, I paid $20 (yes, even for a girl...though I wasn't on the guest list).  And what did I get?  Monday night techno music.  I guess for some people, techno music is their thing, but not so much for me.  A lot of the people in the club were just standing around, looking aimlessly, not dancing, but more talking on the floor and around the alleys.  In total, my friends were at the club for less than an hour, throwing out money into the trash.  Basically, the dj kept playing the same track over and over, interlaying it with something else.  The dancers themselves even looked bored.

Around halfway when we were they, the dj changed, so we crossed out fingers, hoping that it would be better...but.....no, it got worse.  Not only was it still techno music, but it was slow techno music.  At that point, I called it a night and we left.

Another negative was no seating on the outside, but that could be because it was closed on Monday.  I could see how it could get better on weekends, so I'm still going to visit at least one more time in the future.  Just...be smart and don't go on weekends..unless you like techno.",1,0,0

I always meet interesting people\/guys - good looking crowd around my age who don't make me feel like an oldie hanging out with total youngsters!!

The bars are always crowded and keep you waiting, the bartender made my friends drink completely wrong, the line to the bathroom was horrible! Waited about 20 minutes because there were only I think 5 stalls. I really thought I was going to have an accident. 

Now the first time I went was in the winter so way too cold to be outside, but inside was horrible. So crowded you couldn't dance, basically swaying and it was hot and sweaty. But I believe the pool section was closed off so you couldn't go out there even if you wanted to. Only a small section was open.

The second time I went MDW and we got in free to see Kaskade. I love Kaskade and have liked him since early 2000s but I was a little disappointed with his set! I'm so sad. I'm not sure if it's because we were so far away and it wasn't that loud because it was outdoors or maybe just the atmosphere? We were standing along the pool on those mesh stands in the water.

If you don't believe that...just pay attention when you're in the club.  As long as hip-hop is playing, the dance floor stays packed....but the moment the DJ switches to another genre, the dance crowd scatters in different directions as if someone just yelled over mic that the building is on fire.

I frequent VeGaS on the regular, so I've been to almost every hot nightclub in VeGas and I'd take Sin Sundays @ Vanity & Haze on a Saturday night, any day over XS.  Again, XS is probably the nicest nightclub in VeGaS but the music is LAME.  I'm sorry but hot girls with bad music just ain't a good mix.  Pretty much all the hot spots in VeGaS has hot chics, so it's imperative that a club brings good music to the table.  Sorry to disappoint but XS simply fails when it comes to the music, so the best I can do is give it 2 stars.",1,0,0

From the get go I can tell this place is run very professionally. When they open there are tons of employees outside to entrance to direct you to the correct queue.  Even though the are typically large intimidating bouncer sized dudes, they are very friendly and will help you with all you need.

Security is very thorough which is understandable to keep violence and drugs, etc out of the venue.

The venue itself is amazing they do such a good job in converting the swimming pool area into a night club. I really loved the blasts of cold air the drop on the crowd once in a while. It got really crowded in places but it was still easy to find places where it was not crowded and you had room to dance.

My only complaint is that too many people are sitting around just listening to the music instead of dancing! Come on people.

It is of course very expensive. Try to get on a guest list with your hotel concierge to save a little money. All the females in my group got in for free, I still had to pay $100. (I think this reverse sexism is very common, but I'm okay with it I think it makes for a better crowd) The drinks are very expensive about $20 each. So many have a drink or two before showing up.

A big bonus for me was that the music was not overwhelmingly loud. They have it at just the right amount. You can feel the music pulsate through your body but it doesn't leave your ears ringing (and damaged) for days after.",3,1,0

This EDM music was nearly universally danceable, partially due to the smiling, giddy awesome DJ that night David Guetta but also before\/after his set. If you're coming for a DJ expect them on from 2-4am just about.

Crowd: Attractive 20-somethings for the most part. And apparently the club was at its record capacity that night-  Guetta announced there were 10k people there! That's a lot of attractive people...

$75 cover for men and $30 for women that night- get to know a promoter or go with a well-connected friend, or simply be warned.

I went with 4 friends to celebrate the opening on New Year's 2009. I had purchased tickets ($150\/guy) well in advance so I get there @10pm and the line is 200 yards long. WTF? Ok, I'll wait here and I should be in by 11-11:30pm right - just in time for New Year's toast? NO WAY!
While waiting I saw hot girls walking by on their phones going like "".. ok, I need to go around the back? ok..."" Apparently the scumbag bouncers were letting people in for bribes through the back of the club. Nice going bouncers! We paid $600 to just sit here in line? BOUNCERS ARE SCUMBAGS!
Two of my friends decide to leave and come back later. Two of us finally get in @12:30am, the New Year's ""toast"" was in line - nice going!
We're in and I order a drink. I left my drink on a table next to me while checking out the people around me. My glass was half-full and bus boys tried to take my drink on two occasions!!! I was like WTF is wrong with you people?! The glass is HALF-FULL not empty!!! STOP STEALING MY DRINK! I PAID $10 for the damn beer! Gee!
Since the reservation was in my name and my other two friends just called because they were about to get in I went there to let them in. But the bouncers would not let them in because the bouncers said my friends had already got in?! I was like WTF? The stupid bitch who let us in had signed off on all 4 names (as opposed to signing off on 2 of us only) and now my FRIENDS could not get in?! Unbeliveable!!! So my friends never got in! $300 down the drain right there!
Listen to this: I heard that even the cabana people who paid $3000 couldn't get in until midnight!
I mean: these bouncers should be fired! Why are they letting people around the back? is $150 not enough? If so why not tell us? Price it right, for god's sake! Why do I have to bribe these fat scumbags to get in?!

we go up to the promoters (guys dressed in suits) or guys who look like they have sticks up their asses and ask questions like how long will it take and one of the girls friends has a table so we ask about that.  when they talk to you, if they do, they dont look at you.  no eye contact.  so you feel like a psycho or a piece of dirt.  i said excuse me miss to the table hostess and she didnt even acknowledge me.  same thing with the host.  meanwhile they have this other line besides the table and general admission line where the host lets in whoever he likes.  well, i say, the host has pretty bad taste.

$20 for girls.  $30 for guys.

inside this place is insane.  the entry is and front of the club is like an larger version of tryst.  walking further in there is the pool with surrounding pool chairs. then the middle area with a bar and tables for people to gamble.  up one floor are the cabanas which i heard were so hot that no one was sitting in them.

this place was packed.  filled wall to wall with people.  i have never seen anything like it.  when you get tired you can dip your feet in the pool.  while doing that we see some guy spit a huge loogie or barf into the pool.  within minutes guys on walkies were surrounding the area and a cleanup crew was trying to coax the puddle of spit or whatever in the pool away from the center of attention.  pretty funny.  my feet came out after that.  i saw two people actually get into the pool.  most people were only halfway in.  lots of toe jam in there.

i secretly hope this club fails because the promoters are so snooty and mean.

this last time we went.  we went through a host. and getting in was really smooth.  they have someone who expresses groups of all girls in for free so yay.

does anyone notice how rude and ghetto the guests are though?  the guys are cheap and people are just rude.  there was open, public seating and we got into two little arguments about them!  three guys were sitting, one got up.  i sat down.  one of the guys says to me ""we are waiting for our girlfriends so when they come back, im sorry""  the dude who got up comes back and tells me to ""get up""  im like excuse me?  hes tells me that if i dont he will call security.  i say go ahead, this is public seating and he left.  anyone can sit.  they insult us and say ""you chinese girls""

another group - a girl in a fleece and sneakers is laying on the cabana.  she moves her feet and my friend sits.  she taps her friend on the shoulder and points at my friend.  the girl tells her to kick my friend!  i overhear and say ""WHY?""

The look of this place is amazing.  The best DJs play here.  The sound is great.  

But wow, it's hard to move around here, and kind of confusing.  There aren't really any landmarks to text people where you're at.  When you get admission, you aren't necessarily in the actual club.  That's one more entry.  Get into that, and it's full contact with everyone.  You will not be able to dance inside if it's a sold out show.  Lose a friend, or go to the bathroom?  You'll be on your own.

I saw Avicii play.  The warmup DJ is one that could easily play in any other city.  Nothing special at all.  Who still plays ""Mr. Brightside"" anyway?

I know that being a female, I get my share of handouts. However, I was a little let down that the rest of my party couldn't get in as we were promised. 

The place was completely over the top once you got through the safeguarded doors. Everything was top notch, and it showed. I did feel that the guy to girl ratio is 10 girls to every one guy, which may seem great to the promoters, but kind of an uneven crowd if you ask me. Seems like the girls were just doing their own thing since there was so many of them. 

Indoors was extremely claustrophobic... Once I stepped foot in the patio it felt like heaven. Cool breeze, cabanas everywhere, bottle service galore, and way more room to get your dance on.

We really enjoyed being outside by the pool without 9000 idiots knocking into you all the time like most of the over crowded spots on the Strip. We won't be coming here every weekend but a couple times a year with friends in town would be OK with me.,0,0,0

I'm very happy when I come here and it is definitely worth it if you're willing to make the most of it. I've been here as a regular ticket holder and VIP. I can't say you can go wrong when it comes to XS.

First of all, bottle service or not, this is one of the most enjoyable clubs in Vegas; not because of the artists or the price range, but mainly because of the club's design. The club in itself has an indoor and outdoor area. The indoor is medium sized with a rather small dance floor. The exterior is similar except its a much bigger space and you get to see the Dj's back. They have a large area to sit in as well as many areas to lounge in without a table. I'd say this is the place to go to if you don't have a set spot to be at. They have a ton of areas to relax in since its a big venue, so a table isn't really a need. They won't tell you you can't sit like other clubs. TORTURE that I don't want to go through! They also normally have well known DJs spinning here for a cheaper than normal price.

With a table, they treat you like royalty. You get all the perks of skipping lines with minimal hassle, devine service, and extra attention. The staff is beyond amazing; refill your drinks every chance they get, go above and beyond to make sure you're comfortable and have everything you need to enjoy yourself. 

The production in itself is pretty cool if you ask me. Since there's an indoor and an outdoor, they have large monitors displaying crazy images while the Djs are going off. The sound projects all over the location so wherever you go you're never really  missing the party!

Overall I truly enjoy the luxuries this place has to offer. Every single time has been enjoyable with the exception of one extremely crowded and ridiculously cold night. During those warm nights, this club makes your experience that much more enjoyable. There are plenty of places to be and sit, you won't have to worry too much about discomfort if a table or even cabana is out of your price range.

Be smart and get ticket ahead of time! Don't get stuck waiting those ridiculously long lines! Save yourself a headache and party your brains out ;]",7,0,4

Dear lady, 

Just because you're holding the guestlist clipboard, doesn't mean you're hella tight or something. All I asked was a simple question and you were completely RUDE. It's not like you were even working or doing anything important. You were just standing there, holding your damn clipboard, being ugly. They could've gotten someone off of the street to do that job for free!


:) Other than her, this place was fun. I like that the dance floor opens up into the pool area!! Lots of ventilation for the folks dancing which means less sweating and less stinky people.

Their tips to get in line around 9PM on weekend nights were a good one, as there was already a line but it was manageable. For girls with stilletos that would prefer not to get stuck standing in them for that long, guys are your best friend =). 

Yes there is an entrance fee but you can pay it with credit card in case you underestimated your cash, and yes the tables around the main dancefloor are bottle service only. 

I love the layout of this place, the huge chandelier over the main dancefloor, which opens up almost directly in front of the pool. The gogo dancers on either side swaying to the beat. 

Now if only the pool wasn't off limits. Nothing looks more inviting on a warm summer night after downing a couple of drinks. 

There is a really good mix of attractive guys and girls here, especially the girls. Little black and flowy silk dresses, 4 1\/2 heels, plunging necklines and short, short hems. 

And of course, the pool surrounds a bar area and several gambling tables. You know, in case you didn't get enough of it around the rest of the city. 

Mixed drinks average $10+, that's before you ask them to mix it with premium alcohol, and on top of that, the drinks are small.

Saturday night. Party poppin'. Glitzy people. It was awesome.

The venue was huge,  amazing and just plain gorgeous

Here's some tips: 
- Buy your tickets online ahead of time. They're actually really cheap compared to the exorbitant prices at the door. ZEDD Saturday night ended up being triple digits for guys. Guys in our group only spent $35.00 by buying early. 

- Girls. Buy your tickets too. It's only $25.00 online. Your promoter can only get you in so far. A lot of people (mostly girls) were turned away at the second door where ZEDD and the other bars were because they didn't have full access to the club because they were brought in by either promoters or by their charming good looks.

- Yes, apparently XS has two sections, there's the outer club that everyone has access to, and then there's the inner ring that is only allowed for people who paid (stamps are given out at the main entrance by security). So you're shit out of luck if you didn't buy your tickets.

LOL can I seriously still pass for 21?  So we kept doing rounds of birthday shots and I literally gagged because I didn't have a chaser and threw up on their table.  Hahahaha!  My bad.  I tried to excuse myself because I didn't want to be ""that girl"" but they said it was ok and took a count of people who have thrown up and everyone raised their hands and made me feel a lot better.  They wiped it up and we continued to have fun.  Such a nice, friendly crowd here!!  LOL

The place is almost identical to Tryst, but with more asians and more people in general.  Hot club at the moment, and even though I have fun everytime, I would still prefer somewhere else with enough space to get down and dirrrty.",4,4,4

When we finally got inside it was packed. You had to push your way through to get anywhere. It was horrible. Finally we all got to the bar area & I snuck my way to the front. They bartenders were quick but a lot of people lingered around after because you couldn't move to get away. So after going outside we realized there was another line out there. People were going to the pool to sit or the outdoor bar but to come back you had to wait in line. The line took forever & people were paying to get back into the club they accidentally left. It was ridiculous. The music wasn't anything you could dance to. Just a lot of people jumping up & down. So after an hour we decided to leave. Everyone was pushing to move around & it became really aggressive. People were beig pushed on the ground & stepped on. It was chaos. We were so glad to get out of there.,0,0,0

The first club I went to in Vegas was Tao, and I was already very impressed and thought it was gonna be hard to top that. But this time, after being to XS, I was honestly thoroughly impressed and awed.

The venue is very big and gives you a very grand feeling. The crowd is also pretty good, although it may be pretty crowded and hard to find a place to dance in. But what I love the most is the outside pool area. It's absolutely gorgeous. Last time I went, my friends and I (total of 6 ppl) even got to sit down at a table area outside without getting table service. It was pretty awesome. The drinks are also mixed pretty well and the entire experience was awesome.

There was a huge dance floor equipped with stripper poles which led to an outside party area with a pool and even a black jack area.

Being one of the hotter clubs in Las Vegas now I wasn't surprised to see the likes of Quentin Rampage Jackson, a bunch of other UFC fighters and Mike Tyson partying it up there. Speaking of partying it up with stripper poles. Congratulations to a member of our group who's name will be remain with me for climbing up one of the poles and sliding down into the splits! WOW!

On Sunday nights, swim wear and swimming in the pool is encouraged.  I love that I can be swimming and lounging poolside in my bikini at 3 am.  They close the indoor part of the club and only the outside is available.  The music is House\/Techno and they have cuban-esque live trumpet players enhancing the music.  I think the Sunday Night Swim has not quite caught on yet because only about 15% of the people were dressed casually while the majority of the crowd was dressed up in typical club gear.  I could tell the people dressed up were envious of those of us dressed in swim suits because even at 2 am, it's hot in Vegas.  It felt so good to jump in the pool.  XS is too crowded for my taste on Fridays and Saturdays but Sunday was perfect.  There were a lot of people but it wasn't a sardine can.  I can't wait to go to Sunday Night Swim again.

We were on the guest list, so we THOUGHT that meant we would get in free. And to the first, outside section, it did. But to get inside the actual club, we had to pay another $30. WTF. Well we wanted to see David Guetta, so we forked it out.

When we got inside it was super small, and the dance floor was teeny tiny. The only good thing I have to say about the place was that they allowed us to sit in the big red bottle service booths until someone came for actual bottle service. But everything else, blew. 

We couldn't dance because it got so incredibly crowded there was no room. It was so bad we could barely even get around the club. I got so pissed that I literally started pushing people out of my way. I was annoyed as hell.

I came here the weekend of Nov 1st, and my sister warned me that her last time to XS, she said it smelled like nasty foot odor and throw-up. I didn't believe her and told her it was probably a one time thing (since I've been here so many times and never experienced any foul smells). But, boy was I wrong!!! Right upon entering the club, it stunk so bad I had to plug my nose! I couldn't believe my favorite club has lost its ""classy"" reputation. I am very disappointed so I hope XS reads these comments & decides to clean their carpets or take notice of this and change something! Other than that, I still enjoyed myself because the outdoor of XS is amazing! I like the crowd, I like the ambience and I love the music. Feddie Le Grand was the DJ that night & I had the time of my life. 

I still love you XS but PLEASE do something about that raunchy smell inside your club. If you are indeed one of the hottest nightclubs in all of Las Vegas, you have to maintain that standard!

So much so that when confronted with the choice of bottle service at Tryst or XS a month after my initial trip I chose Tryst. XS may be the new kid on the block but it just didn't blow my mind the way I expected it to. I have done bottle service in many of the clubs in Vegas so I have certain expectations when going into it. While it is definitely a fun time, its not my top choice. 

It is the same layout as Tryst, except that it faces a pool and outdoor area with black jack tables and other seating areas. The outdoor seating is fun but, you cannot hear music as well outside. There was plenty of room to move around out there though, even though the inside was packed. (Which I found kind of strange because there was so much space outside). What results is that the outdoor tables are ""disconnected"" from the dance floor, its almost like being in a separate club. In addition, there was ample seating outside that did not have to be reserved. I would also give a warning that the ""tables"" in the pool, yes literally in the water, are cool and easy for ladies to use but would be problematic for a guy wearing sock and shoes. If you are booking bottle service here I would explicitly choose to NOT be at one of those tables. 

Instead of the red theme at Tryst they have brown cushy couches, and it looked like everyone was laying all over the place when we went inside. If I had reserved a table and people were sitting all over the back of the couch of my table I would be a little ticked. The point of bottle service is to have your own space and I just didn't feel as if that would be the case if you had a table inside. One of the things that I love about Tryst is the major visual focal point, the waterfall. In this aspect XS falls short...the major visual focal point is the pool area and the tables in the center. Its not nearly as dramatic as Tryst. 

The night I was there they played house music, which just isn't my cup of tea. All of the staff that I encountered were incredibly friendly. My husband and I got in line very early, we were basically just talking to the main security guy outside of the club when all of a sudden the line was set up around us. Within 10 minutes time the line was so long I could not see the end of it. This was true of all of their lines, which was another thing that deterred me from choosing XS for bottle service. I reserve a table because I don't want to wait in line and the line for reserved tables was just as long- and as far as I could tell not moving- as the regular admission line.",2,0,1

This is pretty much a performing hotspot or rave like atmosphere. Even if you befriend promoters and work something out in advance, prepare to wait at least an hour to get in which eliminates your buzz. They probably do it on purpose so people will buy more drinks when inside. The security staff are rude brutes. Drinks are decent. We came when Redfoo of LMFAO was performing and he was good. The DJ before him was just okay. The atmosphere is shady as fuck. People being dumb and rude and just all over the place. We literally had no room, we were packed like sardines and it was ridiculous. When Redfoo came out, shit hit the fan. People straight poppin mollys and being all retarded since they obviously don't know how to handle their shit. Amateur hour, for real for real. It's similar to Ruby Skye in SF but way smaller. The layout is shit as well. One central walkway to the club and with so many people that's completely dumb. Yeah there were side entrances but they were equally as small given the amount of people in the club. Getting around was a nightmare, could barely dance and the wait make this club not worth the trouble at all. If you ladies are getting dolled up and the fellas coming in fly as hell, go elsewhere to impress. If you want to see an artist or go rave, this is the spot. Otherwise, don't waste your time.

There were points where it was crowded as hell but that's Vegas for you. The decor was nice and it was put together well (I'm really picky when it comes to stuff like that).

The bathrooms are VERY clean, which is a plus. Also, there's some poles for people to dance on. Okay, I'm all about having a good time but there are some people who should NOT be getting on that thing. Enough about that. HAHAHAHA

The music was cool. They played a lot of current stuff but mixed techno-ish stuff with it, which kind of forced me to fist pump the whole night (not my style but whatever; I'll Jersey it up I guess.) There would be a really dope song that would pop up once in a while but then it'd be cut short and I'd be like ""damn, womp wah!"" The gold dressed dancers were working it on the speakers but the black sequined dressed dancers near the tables looked super bored. The dance floor goes outdoors which is nice because if you need a breather, you just need shuffle\/push\/shimmy your way out and you get fresh air. 

One gripe though.  After waiting in line for a good hour, we got to the front when we say we're on the list (via online). Then the guy sends us around to get in the ""Guest List"" line. So we walk around, U-turn it back to where we were just standing but on the other side of the rope (did that even make sense?)

Here's my thought, if it's going to cost you $1500 to get a table on Saturday night to be in the table service LINE, you might as well spend that money on a VIP suite at the Wynn so you can just skip the line.

Came to Vegas to celebrate my birthday with a girlfriend of mine and came to this club twice in our 3-day trip. It was $35 each for female tickets which was a little bit high for a cover charge, but I would pay $35 to go to a great club like XS than pay $20 to go to Omnia again.

Out of the 5 clubs my friend and I checked out (Hakkasan,  Marquee, Light, XS, Omnia), XS had the best vibe. If you love being in an environment where everyone is just having a great time listening to the music and dancing, you'll love this place. There's enough space on and off of the dance floor, the music was really good (Kaskade on Friday night, Zedd on Saturday), the place is kept cool with more frequent bursts of air through the crowd, and an amazing aesthetic - the club is gorgeous.

Let go and just have fun here. If you can, try seeing if a table will let you join them and dance on the small stage areas around the dance floor. Gives you way more dance room! I think you're going to have a really good time here regardless of how big or small your group is and regardless of whether or not you have a table, so have a great time partying!

The entrance fee on Monday night was cheap for XS standards at $30 for dudes and $20 for girls. But, we noticed that most single girls just got in for free if they looked hot with skimpy outfits. Olivia was jealous until I pointed out she was getting in for free (since I was paying ... ).

Once inside, XS was smaller than expected, but it still works. One major positive was the ultra clean bathrooms. The dance floor heated up about 15 minutes after we got there and we staked out a spot in the middle near the front. Morgan Page took over as DJ around 1:30 a.m. and then it became so packed you could literally not move to the beat without bumping others. Eventually you just kind of get used to the close quarters and people touching you on all sides. Hopefully, you'll know one or two of them.

If you don't get a table, there's no place to really relax except outside by the pool or squeezing in with another group. Because of the sausage-fest, ladies should have no problems making several friends. The bartenders were fast and made decent drinks. They ain't cheap, but you didn't go to XS to save money, right.

- Even though the venue is open to the pool area, we weren't boiling in the upper 90s heat (I guess the AC is working pretty well at this joint)

Dislikes:

- Big venue so it's packed to the gills with people
- Inconsistent dress code enforcement: one minute you see someone with a T-shirt then a completely dressed up dude the next
- What's with the big table with a bunch of old guys (we're talking 50s here, folks)?
- Slow table service: we were making our own drinks
- ""Bigger"" ladies in tight clothing: sorry, nothing against you big ladies, but tight clothing is a priviledge not a right

PS - I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about when they say it's full of Asians

PPS - get a table + bottle service; I'm not a big fan of fighting a crowd 15 deep just to get a drink no waiting in that ridiculous line",2,3,2

The staff has complete disregard for their customers and Yelp keeps removing my review, probably because this club is advertising with Yelp.

I love love this club. I make sure to come here every time when I am in Vegas with my friends. It is a go to place in Vegas especially for girls. I love that they have a lot of different places to dance and lounge around and not overly populated everywhere and like a sardine can like most clubs in Vegas. The best part about XS is the pool. Also, XS is the prettiest nightclub I have been to. 

Cover charges can range anywhere for guys from 50-to over 100...If you just walk in and you are a girl its usually about 20, but it helps to get connections in Vegas. My girlfriends and I never pay. The line here is pretty crazy, but it moves pretty fast and they usually let you cut if you are just with a group of girls. 

Bouncers here for the most part are douche bags but they don't really care since everyone wants to go to XS. XS and Marquee are probably the go to clubs in Vegas right now. Make sure you come early or get bottle service!",1,0,1

We were outside by the pool which was good cause when it got full, it did not get hot at all. You can even jump in the pool lol. You can go inside guys have to pay -_-. The two warm up DJs were really good. Once Avicii played, it was a good show. I cant give this place 5 stars cause drinks are really expensive and you are behind the dj booth. Overall, it was a great time. 

Promotor Chris Cowette has the hookups for XS and he refers you to other promotors to other places. Be patient and follow his instructions. He is great!

Some random guys in line tried sweet talking the bouncers to let us in free but they only managed to talk him into letting us cut the line. Ok I'm cool with that.

Guys were buying us drinks left and right. We walked up to the bar and my girlfriend orders a round of patron shots for us all but some nearby gentlemen picked up our tab. Thanks guys.

One of my girlfriend goes off to take a spin on one of the stripper poles on the dance floor we entertain ourselves watching her take lessons from the MILF holding her own at that pole but then wander off to the poolside bar where we stayed the rest of the night because the drinks just kept coming and the conversations from our gentlemen callers were entertaining.

It is one of the largest nightclubs I have ever seen and the decor is amazing. The patio is what makes the place so great but it was freezing when I was there right after New Years so I didn't really get to experience it.

I had gone right when the club opened (10pm) but the place filled up really fast! I was pretty surprised but then again, XS is one of the hottest clubs in Vegas right now.

The dancefloor was empty for a bit but also filled up pretty fast and about half an hour after dancing a bit, some awesome high roller at a table started making it rain onto the dancefloor! Ok so it was only $1 bills but I made $36! He totally made my night. After the rain, everyone packed onto the dancefloor and the music got better so everything was awesome!

The one thing about XS that I didn't like was that the bouncer that we talked to didn't know our promoter even though one of the other bouncers knew him. She wanted us to go to the back of the line and get a ticket and it was just so complicated. I was just annoyed because another bouncer had clearly recognized the name of our promoter but we had to pay extra to get in because this other woman didn't know him. Girls got in for free but guys had to pay the $30 cover. LAME. Make sure all the bouncers know your promoter!

Once I entered the clubbed, the dance floor was filling up with happy dancers ready to dance the night away. I was one of those happy dancing people awaiting for DIPLO! However, after about  15 minutes of being able to dance freely with my boyfriend and sister,  we were squished into a tiny corner near where the DJ was at. Not a very suitable situation for a lady who has heels and a fever for dancing. As the night progressed, a bunch of drunken gals and men took over the dance floor and made a sea puddle of beer and mixed drinks on the floor making it slippery like black ice and trashed up the floor with empty bottles of beer--totally not classy.

I saw that there were stripper poles on each table that had bottle service. Ladies, if you're drunk and have a tight dress on...when you probably know doesn't look so great when you bounce around and bounces extra things around the abdomen, you probably should choose a different dress to catch ""prince charming's"" eye?...

Other than that note, my experience was fun-o-kay.

Who wants to go to a half-empty club? Then go to a effin lounge who let's Tom, Dick, and Harry in along with their grandmothers and aunt.  

Anyhow, if you spend $96 million on a club it better be top-notch and it is.  If you partying in a $96 million club, it isn't going to be cheap and you wont find dollar drinks.  So if you are a baller on a budget stick to lounges with no lines. 

The gold you see is real 24k gold, but good luck trying to steal it. Bouncers are abundant but overall, they are better than other clubs.  The cocktail waitress are super model HOT, but that's all about you're gonna get unless you got a Blackcard.  Any VIP table inside the club has decent view of dancefloor and traffic flow is great to fish for hotties walking by.  Tables outside arent optimal for tailchasing and are cheaper than inside of course.  However, if you get a daybed by the pool it is romantic spot for your date or fling for the night.  Great makeout spot or to have a pre-qualifier conversation.

Getting inside isnt too difficult if you have a table.  If you are paying cover, then expect to wait at least an hour.  It's a $96 million dollar club, DUH! 

What I particularly like about it is traffic flow is good, getting in and out of club is good, decor is excellent, and it's just bright enough to get a good look at people even if you have your beer googles on.  

Only thing is their sound system could be improved.  You dont feel the crisp bass.  Sometimes there is an ordor from the bathroom areas.  They need to keep air-spraying scents into the ventilation.

Good:
- On the face, it should be an awesome club. Next to a pool, nice interiors and exteriors.. generally well designed space. 
- Crowd on Thanksgiving weekend was better than Tao.. but nothing impressive. Not bad, but nothing impressive. My friends tell me that it's usually better...

Bad:
- Big chunk of the nice area around the pool was blocked off. (so.. what's the point if you can't sit down next to it)
- Too many tables inside.. I know that table service is how you make you money.. but c'mon.. give some space for dancing.
- Due to weather - outside was FREEZING cold. (no worries in the summer I guess)
- Watered down drinks. They were on par with the free ones you get while gambling...

Awfull
- The bouncers were between rude and a-holes. I know they have to manage the crowd, but they should be able to differentiate between drunken a-holes that need to be pushed around (or thrown out) and respectable guests that don't appreciate being treated like cattle.

The place is beautiful, with access to the Encore pools (the only thing I didn't like was that we couldn't actually walk around the pools, just a small part overlooking the pools was open that night, unlike the Sunday nightswim).
We didn't wait in line to enter for long, we were on Chris Hornak's guest list (he's great!) and got free entrance and drinks - I love it when they ask me for my ID at the door! :) Be sure to check out the dress code before going, bouncers will turn you down if you're not dressed accordingly (no sneakers guys, please!)
The girls' bathroom was great, I don't know if all club bathrooms in Vegas are like this but this one was super clean and the woman taking care of it had everything you needed to 'freshen up': perfumes, etc., no queues since there are so many stalls.
That night there was a performance by Lil Jon (I had no idea who he was, sorry), the music was OK, but I guess I prefer other kinds of music. The club was packed and it took a long time to get drinks.
In fact, the only real negative part of my review are the drinks: too light and too much ice, I couldn't taste the alcohol in them - but thankfully we were there on a guest list and we got 2 free drinks - and while waiting in line to get those, a girl gave us her 2 free drinks so we ended up having 3 each! It would have bothered me though, if I had paid them that there wasn't enough alcohol in them.
We walked to the Wynn and got a cab there with no wait.
Next time I'm in Vegas I'll definitely try the Sunday nightswim here!",3,0,0

I didn't think it was possible for XS to look even more incredible than it already does.  It does.  I didn't think it was possible for XS to sound even better.  It does.  The visual production upgrade is also AMAZING.  If you thought the outside portion of XS was beautiful before, wait till you visit again.  

You know these new mega clubs pop up every year or so and they are always hyped up to be ""the new best club in vegas"" but when I actually visit them, none of them compare to XS.  It's not even close.  I had the chance to visit Omnia and XS last weekend and while Omnia is definitely a nice club that everyone should check out, the experience was not even close to our experience at XS.  If XS was a 10\/10 (which it is), then Omnia is at best an 8\/10.  You can't beat the XS layout, the pool, the gambling area, the backdrop of the Wynn and Encore Hotel while you are outside, and the vibe that comes with XS.  When you are at XS, you can chill outside or you can rage inside.  I like having both options.  

There is a reason XS is the #1 club to this day after 6 years.  6 years is an eternity for a Vegas club.  You think Hakkasan or Marquee will still be relevant after 6 years?  If I were a betting man, I'd say no.  They will be as relevant as TAO is today in my opinion.  

As for lineups, XS has an AMAZING lineup which is just as good (if not better) than Hakkasan and Omnia:  Avicii, Arty, Kaskade, Deadmau5, Dillon Francis, Diplo, Skrillex, Slander, Zedd, etc.  I'd take that amazing lineup over Calvin Harris, Martin Garrix, Armin Van Buuren any day of the week.  

XS is the best because they cater to their wide range of customers.  From the guy who just wants to get into the club with a presale or wait in general admission  to the whale who has no problem dropping 100k in one night, XS listens to their customers and they take care of them.

My best friend and I were able to get in for free by getting on a guest list (Michelle's Promo List), which alone saved us $40 each since the cover charge increased at the main door. So, make sure you call a promoter to get on a guest list! We also got 2 free top shelf complimentary drinks (up to $20 value)...each! 

If you have a group, make sure you've got some females with you! Because you get sent to the front of the lines if you've got ladies with you. It was just my friend and I, and we got to bypass at least a 45min wait. 

We went last night (Sunday) and it was a swimsuit party with Major Lazer as the guest DJ. We partied and danced from 10:30pm-3:30am....non-stop. Major Lazer didn't appear until about 1:30ish, but the local DJ before him did a good job. Lots of EDM with some hip\/hop and rap.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the drinks are EXPENSIVE! Expect at least $15-20 per drink! We used our drink vouchers but decided we wanted to get a couple more drinks on our own tab and ended up paying close to $60 for 3 drinks! Good note: bartenders make them strong and quick!

All in all, AWESOME party Vegas experience! Nobody was being ratchet...just all around good dancing, music, and party fun. I liked how big the place was and the separation between the pool and DJ stage area.

We came to see Avicii via a promoter who my friend knew, but since we came on a particularly busy night, we weren't actually going to be able to get inside to the dance floor where Avicii was going to be playing (which we learned after arrival).

The bartenders here apparently don't like you unless you're a cute girl or a really sexy masculine man, so it took a while to get a drink. I had to really bring out the gay to get their attention, but after I called someone hun, I had my cocktail in a jiffy.

Our whole group ended up getting into the main room to see Avicii. I'm not saying that the bouncer asked for money in exchange for letting us through. Why would that ever happen in Vegas? All I'm saying is that one moment we were out and the next we were in.

Once inside the main room, they wouldn't let us onto the actual dance floor, so we had to wait until the bouncer blocking access to the floor was preoccupied with someone else trying to push their way past him, at which point we were able to slip by unnoticed.

I'm a really determined individual.

The actual show was a pretty terrible experience. We were packed onto the floor like oranges that are packed together really tightly. The scantily clad dancer next to me kept kicking drinks off of her little stage whenever someone set them down and, inevitably, a number of them went flying toward me. Thanks, lady.

Avicii came on obnoxiously late. My friends said that this was the longest they had ever waited for anyone at XS. We couldn't leave the dance floor because we wouldn't have been able to get back in... what's the point of being on the dance floor if you can't leave to go get a drink? Avicii came on at 1:45am, by which time we were sober, annoyed, squished, and a little wet and smelly from the alcohol shower courtesy of basically-naked lady (the alcohol wasn't flowing where it counted).

I felt bad for anybody who spent real money on this, because it was just so terrible, haha.

We left mid set. It was cool to stay to see Avicii just to be able to say we did, but he came on soooo late and wasn't even impressive when he did come on. People were shoving and being rude and getting in fights. There were a handful of really nice people apologizing for having to shove to squeeze past and whatnot, but most were just aggressive and rude.

We went somewhere else to get drinks afterward and had a blast.

Once inside the layout reminded me of Tryst, dance floor in the center with tables surrounding it. The difference was the outdoor pool and lounge area. This space was really pretty and spacious, if only they had more space for the dance floor. Who ever the DJ was that night did a good job with choice of songs and mixing. I also thought it was fun to play around in the shallow part of the pool. It was nice to kick off the heels and cool off.

It was a fun night, maybe I'd go back if I didn't have to pay cover. Just remember to get your credit card and ID back from the bartenders! Seems like the bartenders have a bad habit of not giving those back.

Unforunately this club was not too diverse, like all the other clubs we went to over the weekend....

We all thought that since it was a Saturday it was gonna be hip hop night.....but we were all disappointed because they still played the trancy, house, hip hop. My recommendation and only main gripe about this would be to ....

******PLEASE CHANGE THE DJ******* 

because the mixes are kinda whack....A good song comes on...then a few seconds later turns into trancy whack stuff....

Other than the music & the fact that it takes forever to get a drink at the outstide bar once the party, and the drinks average about $14 each, is cracking, so I still dig this club.

My 3 companions and I, a total of 2F and 2M, bought the pre-sale tickets for Chainsmokers well over a month or two in advance because we are ravers and devoted fans.  Mind you, the ticket sales said ALL ACCESS with no bull shiz fine print of anything less.  The tickets also said formal wear only, NO TENNIS SHOES, NO SHORTS, NO PANTS WITH HOLES, NO FLIP FLOPS, NO BAGGY JEANS.   Naturally as ravers, we tend to dress comfortable, especially comfortable shoes, but due to the intense dress code, we dressed waaaaaay up.    

We show up early, around 9:30 before the doors open, and are told by one of the security at the entrance, ""Man you guys are early...""so we then proceed to grab a quick bite first.  We then soon realize what a huge mistake that was, when we are lead down an enormous maze of turns and finally stopped at a security entryway to throw away all of our liquids.  We are then escorted into the large, HOT, ball room with a massive line.  This we did not expect, as a mile back into the line, they were letting people in immediately at the box office for those who paid the door fee which was now about $40-$50 more than the pre-sale.  So basically... going pre-sale doesn't help you by any means?

So now we are in this long ass line.  We waited for about an hour and a half.  Everyone is sweating, no one has water, and they won't even let people out of the line to go pee.  Women are holding their shoes (naturally) and everyone more or less looks completely pissed off.  We finally make it to the security \/ ticket check to find out that they are letting everyone in, regardless of what they were wearing.  I saw a guy in LEGIT slippers and Jeans with holes everywhere.  Hell, if I would have known that was acceptable, I would have worn my dancing shoes!  But clearly, this place doesn't give two shiz' if they lie to you.  Upon being checked by security, my gf was told that she wasn't allowed to take in her SEALED vape juice... yet they allow vapes in?  They told her she would have to go check it into the bag check.  We made sure we asked the security guy, ""You are going to make sure they let her back in right?  Without going through this line?""   Yes, the guy tells us.  NOT the case.  Once she arrived at the bag check, they made her leave her entire purse with them because she didn't have any other kind of bag to keep her juice in... so she had to carry all her stuff.  Then they proceeded to give her a 10 minute hassle when she tried to re-enter.  The worker was so annoyed and completely disrespectful towards her and barely allowed her access back into the outdoor area.

All this has occurred and we haven't even gotten into the DJ lounge yet.  Once inside, we desperately try to find the line to get into the lounge where the DJ's are set up and playing.  We get pointed in a direction and are stopped by a very large security gentleman who tells us that THE LOUNGE IS FOR VIP ACCESS ONLY.  This was not stated anywhere on our purchase!!!!  He then told us that in order to get in the lounge to see the DJ from the front, you have to pay $3000 for a table.  Are you kidding me?  At this point we are completely and utterly defeated.  XS has ruined our plans to see one of our favorite DJ's.  We sit down not far from the VIP entrance and see three women (attractive) walk up to the security guy we just spoke to.  One of the women runs her hand down his face and whispers something into his ear and he lets them pass.  Once that happens, this other woman who witnessed the whole thing approaches the security guy and proceeds to say something along the lines of, ""Are you going to pretend that we just didn't see that?  Are we not hot enough for you?  You gonna let us in if we touch you?""   The security guard just rolls his eyes and ignores her completely.   At this point I am furious and disgusted with the amount of disrespect this club has for men and women alike.

A couple hours later we are shoved into the center of the outdoor venue, AKA, the backside of the DJ table, body to body and no one is dancing...  There are tons of people right at the entrance of the lounge who are just standing there smoking and drinking and having conversations and more or less completely ignoring the DJ.  I can't even headbang to the sick beats of chainsmokers without someone staring daggers at me or spilling their drink on me or nearly falling off the couch onto me while dancing on top of it... 

Seriously guys?  You have turned what could have been an amazing event for everyone into a exclusively enjoyable event for only the rich.  You have very clearly hired people who are easily bribed and could care less about the people they are supposed to be serving.  I will never spend a single dollar of my money at this club EVER again.  Worse experience of Vegas.

Be aware that there isn't a guestlist at XS on Fri\/Sat nights. This isn't really an issue as long as you can arrive to XS shortly after the club opens or within the first hour. The staff rolls the line and it moves quickly so you pay cover and you're inside a lot quicker than you would expect looking at the size of the line. On Sun\/Mon nights the guestlist is very liberal and the staff will comp entry on groups with mostly girls and a couple of guys. 

A far as the club itself... not much more needs to be said. Immaculate attention to detail regarding the interior of the club. The dancefloor patio opens up to the pool where you can get away from the crowds when it gets too packed inside.

You can go there and chill and drink or you can go there and rage..it's really up to you. This past weekend on 11\/11\/11, the club wasn't jam packed to the point where you can feel everyone around you while dancing (like Marquee) but it wasn't empty like you're wondering where everyone else might have gone to party.

It's the Goldie Locks perfect!


Just the only thing I hate was that, even though it was easy for us to get in because we were 10 girls on the guest list, one of the guys in the front was on a power trip and had a douche-y attitude. But jokes on him 'cuz we got in anyway thanks to his higher level coworker. It was a good night anyway.",4,2,3

None the less, the place has nice size and you the entrance is different, because you walk down steps to enter the club. Note, this place is in the Wynn Casino and given the decor of the casino, the club matched, but I guess I expected a little more. Hence, I am not quite giving a full 5 starts, but more than 4 stars is how I would rate the club. That night there was a good vibe and atmosphere. You will have no problem in moving about in this club, even with the crowd being large and and it was packed (again, this was a Monday night), so no matter where you are at you will find your groove as you set up as you examine how and who you want to have a good time with. 

The dance floor is right in the middle of the club, which is nice so no matter where your at you can turn and always be looking at the floor. The music was a little on the loud side, which I guess is a good thing, cause you will have to lean forward to who ever you talking to because and based on their reaction you will know how interested they are in you. 

Something that caught me by surprise(but its the Wynn), was in the pool area off the club, had this woman dancing on a small island to the music, I am going to assume that she was there all night. I had a few drinks and they had could have been a little stronger. The staff was quick with service both the bar (strongest drink that night)  and the waitresses that moving through out the club where ready to take your order. That night the crowd was a little you for me and I am sure the the next time I am in Vegas, I will return to see if the vibe would be different.",0,0,0

The space is massive and open (housing thousands comfortably), and spills outdoors into the pool area which you can dip into, if you're so inclined. This is the kind of club where absolutely anything can happen. Create your own fantasy and play them out here...you've got a full supporting cast...

Came here for New Years Eve once to see Deadmaus and it was fabulous. Unfortunately, this past weekend I came here for my bachelorette party. All of my girls and I bought tickets for the David Guetta show. We got in line at midnight and got inside the club at 12:45pm which wasn't too long of a wait. Once we got inside it was terrible. The club was so packed!! And not in a good way. There was no room to move. I've never seen it like that before, but granted it was Labor Day weekend with David Guetta. The place felt like a fire hazard though. Honestly, if a fire or emergency would have broken out I'm pretty sure people would have gotten trampled and died. It was extremely overcrowded and unsafe. I'm surprised they let that many people in. We had one drink and then decided to leave.",1,0,0

It's a huge place and as soon as you walk in, you know they did their homework in terms of how to make the place look grand.

IF, and of if, the weather is nice and not one of those 90+ degree nights, bottle service near the pool is probably the best.  There's an outdoor DJ, beautiful pool (can't go in), and plenty of eye candy all around.  I've been lucky enough to have had a table at the cabana, the round couches, and the normal tables.  If you want more privacy, then cabana is the way to go or else the round couches near the edge of the pool is a nice option, but it is a bit hard to stop randoms sitting down.  Even had someone stole our bottle once, but good thing the bouncer got the dude.  Fool.

As for bottle service inside, unless you get the roped off tables, it's a mess.  As the night goes on and more come in, the inside & dance floor is an absolute zoo.  It's so crowded that it's pretty damn hard to walk through, so it's easy to feel cramped.

Drinks are around $12-15.

DJ's good, and now there are some big name EDM DJ's that'll perform here.

There are also tables in the club near the pool and it's a dangerous place to be especially if you're drunk haha.  Table minimum is $25 at the beginning of the night and it can jump up to $100!  The only good part is you get to order free drinks just like playing table games at the casino, that is, if you last that long :P

As usual, bouncers are pretty douchey, so don't mess around.  Guys, best go in with a group of girls, at least 1:1 ratio and prepare to pay cover!  Best to come early too since I've seen the line... go quite far.",8,6,7

I love the venue and the crowd.  

The lines aren't long if you're VIP or have bottle service, which is a must. If you decide to wait in line, expect to be there all night.  You'll hate it.  You'll hate watching all the bouncers allow all the groups of pretty women in with tons of ugly dudes...

If you don't have bottle service, the bar line will be just as worse as the line to get in.  

Once you get your drink, the DJ will be done performing and then it's time to go home... might as well Surrender.

Make sure you dress to the nines.  This is a place to see and be seen.

Don't expect to get into the club if you're wearing sports gear such as jerseys and hats lol.  Save those for your local bar. 

This place makes tons of money, considering how much VIP Bottle service or even general admission is.

This place is visually amazing and is a must do, if only once!!!  There is gold dripping from every inch and the servers and dancers are beautiful.

I am not a big fan of clubs and am only a fan of XS in the off months.  This place is ginormous and during the summer months is so jammed pack full of people that I get uncomfortable.  However, during the winter months you can easily move around and get drinks, etc.  

There are stripper poles by the table service and off to the sides.  We tend to hang out near these as it is always a blast to watch the drunken amateurs attempt their acrobatic feats!!!  The outside area is another favorite of ours as you can move more freely, but getting out there is an adventure as you have to squeeze your body through the dance floor.  However, once out there you have more options for bar, bathrooms, and even gambling.  The outside area is pool centric and towards the end of the evening people always end up dancing in the pool.

Second the dance floor was a hot mess with no hot men in sight. I don't know if it was an off day or Paris Hilton scared everyone away, but it's summer time on a Saturday night....where are the good looking guys? 

Oh and let me mention the $18 drink that had almost no booze, and I'm talking about an AMF here. I'm a small girl and I couldn't even feel it's effect.

On the bright side, they had their hot tub going so I could chill and put my sore feet in after dancing for 6 hours. Dancing on the pool steps was also plus.

We finally found a chill spot near the back of the club where we could spread out and dance, talk and drink. The music finally started getting good around 3 in the morning and lasted about an hour then it went back to the top 40 hits....blah.

It took about 45 minutes to get in because we didn't have advance tickets and because Kaskade was spinning. Admission was $55 which is not unusual in Vegas for guys and XS year after year from my understanding is rated one of the top nightclubs in Vegas. 

Once we got in, the place was rammed. The club is beautiful, the dance floor was large and even the outdoor pool area was open too. We ordered Corona all night ($11 tax in). The crowd was amazing, great guy to girl ratio and great party vibe, nothing like this in Toronto, Canada. Kaskade was amazing and had the crowd moving during his entire set.

Cons: 
-The club ALWAYS seems to be over-crowded.  It's packed like sardines and makes going from the inside to the outside seem like an adventure.  
-They close out the inside if it is too crowded.  This definitely annoys me since I want to be inside watching the Dj.  

Pros: 
-Nice set up. They have a fairly large inside, two bars, one on each side.  Plus, on the outside they have pools, two other large bar areas, and more restrooms.  Some clubs only have one restroom area which can make for long lines, I'm looking at you Surrender.  
-They always have great Djs here.  No matter which weekend or which day, there is always someone worth seeing.  
-They have night swim in the summer.  This is probably one of my favorite things to do in Vegas.  It's basically one large pool party where everyone is having fun together.  During regular nightclub events, talking to people may be a bit more difficult, but at night swim everyone is much friendly and open to mingling.

I don't think it would have helped me had I specified in advance, I know that it's all about who you know and money. I was so disappointed when the hostess was taking us up and we were going farther and farther away from everything.

We couldn't hear the music from the DJ very well unless we were in the cabana, but then we wanted to be outside watching what people we could see. We had a good time, but we all ended up wandering around and leaving the club really early, pretty much after the bottles were done. It seemed like the people that were in the cabanas next to us ended up leaving early too. The service was great and our waitress was hanging around a lot, I think that she was really bored!

Came here for opening night on New Years and had a table\/bed by the pool. I mention this because even tho it was chilly, the staff did their best to try and keep us warm. They brought extra heat lamps, blankets(lol for real), and moved us to another table when we asked. They were often checking in on us to make sure we were ok with everything. Considering it was open night and super hectic, this was impressive. Our security guy even walked me to and from the ladies room lol.

Like other people have mentioned the layout, it does remind me of Tryst. I never got why so many people liked Tryst or what the big deal was. 

XS seems to be the more sophisticated sibling of Tryst. It's like they thought of how Tryst could be better and made it happen here. There are gold accents everywhere.. as soon as you walk in there is a gorgeous gold wall sculpture ,, the entryway itself is beautiful. The tables are more spacious, and the layout just seems to be easier to navigate thru and makes more sense then Tryst.. if you get what I mean. Like you don't have to struggle thru tight spaces or take detours to get to where you have to go. There's more room for people to stand around or dance, and therefore there's more room for people to get thru when needed. The pool area is much bigger than Trysts and it follows the aesthetic theme of XS's inside.. meaning, it's gorgeous. The cabanas are setup like little hotel rooms.. with TV's, mini bars, sofas and indoor\/outdoor seating. They're also walled vs just curtained off. The music is pretty much the same as Trysts.. only I noticed more dance\/house which to me is a plus. 

Some little details stand out as well. Such as the champagne glasses, which are much different here than most other clubs. They have gold(surprise lol) tiled bottom parts.. so pretty. And with our champagne came berries and chocolates.. how nice! It seems to me like XS cares about providing their patrons with extras here, and not like they're just going through the motions. 

I'm definitely a fan of XS! Just when I thought I was ""over"" Vegas lol!",5,2,4

They did a great job...It was an utter nightmare - you had to push through a zoo of people to get in - and all the tables were supposedly sold out that Saturday night. Bouncers are ba$tards as ever, taking bribes like no other and still after dropping a lot of cash to even get in the line, we STILL had to pay AGAIN when we got further down. Obviously since it's the hottest new thing, we will all put up with it. And after that annoyance of entry you will quickly forget and enjoy the rest of your night. 

I'd check on the DJ before you go if you only have a good time with certain types of music. It was mostly house, and it was house throughout, even at the bar in the middle of the pool area. Similar dancefloor location as in Tryst, stripper poles are abundant at the tables. And there were a few older women that chose to use them. They weren't hired by the bar, that's for sure...

XS is a beautiful specimen of a club. Wide open doors to the outside. Bars lining the sides of the entrance. Once outside, there is a pool, lined with heat lamps and tables. The pool has floating padded lounge chairs - something different. In the middle of the pool there is circular bar with XS dancers, and spots to gamble. More lounge chairs...most clubs seem to be incorporating their pools, which I can't really figure out. I wonder how many drunks land in the pool by the end of the night!?",0,0,0

Here for Veteran's Day Weekend so there wasn't a guestlist for Friday or Saturday, but we got on it for Sunday with R3hab playing at free for girls and $20\/guy.  Pre-sales were looking at $20\/girl, $30\/guy.

Got there a little before midnight and I was honestly a little worried they would give me trouble with the guestlist, but they didn't even ID me when asking for my guestlist info and hooked it up no problem.  The lines are long, but we didn't wait far too long--definitely tolerable.

The one thing that stood out to me about XS is not only the gorgeous venue, but the crowd XS attracts.  The layout of the club beats Marquee in my opinion--middle stage, spacious dance floor, places to sit, and gorgeous outside patio with a pool that you can actually go in (though it was blocked off the night I was here).  I love that you could go outside and still hear the music from inside whereas Marquee, you get a change in sound system once you step outside.  XS is also easy to maneuver around and the staff and security gave me no troubles at all.  Plus one.

The crowd was a lot of fun in that it's young, hip, and don't seem as douche-y as the crowd at Marquee who don't know how to get out of the way and always spill drinks left and right.  There was a number of older people, which really confounded me as I would NOT want to be in the crowded dance floor full of energetic partygoers when I'm just going to stand there and stare up at the stage; I was surprised they stayed there for as long as I did to be honest.

Seems like it's predominantly EDM played here, which may be a turn off for those who don't prefer dancing to house music.  I'm not the hugest fan of house, but R3hab was so much fun and I definitely would want to go back even if he wasn't playing.  It seemed like all my girl friends had a blast too so I'm super glad we were able to party here.

Best club I've been to, hands down.  Be back for you, XS!",2,1,3

Loved it.

Stayed in Vegas through Monday and were looking for a place to go out on Sunday night. Had read on yelp this is the place to go and so there we went, 3 guys and 1 girl.

Got there and there was a medium sized line, (of course there was, it's Vegas)...

But line moved really quickly!

Got to the cashier and the cover charge was $25 for both men and women (surprisingly cheap for guys in Vegas). 

So of course I thought, ""quick line, low cover, it's gonna be dead.""

WRONG!

Walked in and it was PACKED! The pool area was closed (as I hear is the norm on Sundays) but regardless there was a large amount people everywhere! 

Music was mixed, not the best in my opinion but hell I danced to it anyway. Crowd was awesome, people of all kinds, all races, all ages getting down in their own ways. Bars were crowded but still moved fast enough so that we could get drinks. Prices for drinks were Vegas prices (no Sunday discounts lol). Bathroom line always moved super fast.

Will definitely return. On Sunday's that is.",0,0,0

XS is handsdown the most luxurous club PERIOD!  It's huge and spans between Wynn and Encore.  Our hostess was incredibly nice and was always checking up on us to make sure our drinks to topped off.  They have a variety of table locations varying from small tables aligning the main dance floor to exclusive cabanas outside.  What makes this place truly a new Las Vegas club are the blackjack tables located poolside.

Nicer clubs than the others I've been to, but it might have been the group but I had an ""alright"" time.  I think it was coupled by the fact that it was mexican independence day and whack ass lil jon was there playing bachata and cumbia all night.  Not a true vegas experience.  Also, it was pool night so people were in their swimming trunks and then others were in their hooker heels and short dresses- all dressed to the 9s. Soooooooooooooo must've been a bad day.  

Sucks that it's hard to get in for free though...especially when you roll with a lotta dudes. The club itself is pretty.  The people...I guess it depends what day you go.
I was sitting there and some idiot flicked a cigarette into a corner where a bunch of towels were and it smoked and set on fire!  No guys were willing to pick it up and put it out so I, in my own hooker heels and short dress had to push these pansies out of the way, grab the smoldering towels and stomp on the flames. WTF. 

Drinks are normal for vegas- expensive. Don't get mixed drinks, just get shots to get your moneys worth or pregame.

I was here for Tiesto on New Years weekend, so I assume about as hard a night to enter as any.

- Buy tickets ahead of time if available.  I bought thru Wantickets thru the XS website and they had a separate entrance set up where I walked right in despite arriving at XS around 12:30AM (my plane landed that night at 11:15PM).  Didn't even have to grease the guy at the door, which I fully expected to have to do since I got there kinda late and this is standard practice at some NYC clubs, even if you have a ticket.

- Dress nice.  Really nice.  But leave the $500 loafers at home.  Wear the $150 ones.

- Forget bottle service.  Drink prices aren't THAT bad (under $15 for Tanqueray and tonic) and you can get service quickly enough in the outside bars.

Besides that it's your standard high-end club experience.  Lots of people, some more banged up than others, close quarters, lots of rich Asians (not a bad thing), but as XS you don't have the college crowd\/mindset of wearing as much neon as possible and acting like a complete a-hole like you do in the majority of big clubs, festivals these days.  So HUGE ups for that.",14,4,3

The layout is just like Tryst but A LOT roomier. Bottle service sections aren't as cramped but still a tight squeeze everytime you're trying to walk around. Dance floor is bigger and leads straight out to the pool area. And blah blah blah about the decor and lighting, all been said. $5 coat check right at the entrance to your left. The view walking in is awesome. You have a complete 180º view of the club dead center as you take a few steps down to the main floor. This really bumps up your expectations. So does the club live up to it? Sorta.

MUSIC:
Not sure who was spinning that night but the music was good. I'm a big fan of mash up aka the d-bag music aka the assliction and ed farty music so for those that can't distinguish between the ""mash up"" of 2 genres of music, there it is. They don't play full songs or even to the 2nd chorus so quit your whining.  You have your taste of top 40's, electronic and rock. 

BOTTLE SERVICE:
Seriously, I couldn't have asked for more. Our hostess (Melissa? Sorry, too drunk to remember!), was super nice and checked up on us quite a few times. The bus boy was there even more. We always had enough glasses. 

Bottle pricing breakdown: Ketle One $425. Belv $475. Goose $495. Henny VSOP $595. Gratuity is not added on your bill but don't be shady either.

I wouldn't get a table outside at the pool. It's a few steps away from the dance floor outside but you're still away from everything. Well, that's if you get the tables directly at the entrance to the pool. There are tables on the side that's just in the middle of nowhere.

My only complaint is the same complaint I have at every club in Vegas, ""MR. CLIPBOARD"". D-bag tried to charge 2 people in my group cover. He claimed everyone in my group came inside already and these 2 are extras. I guess following him around and nagging him for 5 minutes worked. He probably got annoyed and just signed a piece of paper to comp them in.

--so sexy, luxurious, grand, extravagant, 100% completely over-the-top, indoor and outdoor dance floor, lots of pools, tables by the pools\/ DJ\/ etc, hot bartenders, beautiful people, but...

CONS:
--CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZY line to get in. Knocked off a star because of this! Even if you're on a list or just really, really hot,... it doesn't matter because you will have to wait in line. They're all about exclusivity. 

--all about house music. Can't hip hop get some love?? :(

--expensive drinks- since they have a never-ending line of people waiting to get in, there's no reason for them to give discounts, etc. Expect to pay ~$20 per drink here!

--ONLY ONE BATHROOM :( when you enter, down the hall, to your right. True, it has a million stalls but, seriously, ONE bathroom?

TIPS:
--Try to get a promoter to help you out! XS is one of the most promoted clubs so it should be easy to find someone. Also, promoters can HOOK IT UP... we got a group of girls + a few guys in, FREE, with 2 drink vouchers each, FREE!

If you have an even ratio of girls to guys, get in touch with a promotor and get yourself on a guestlist. Not only is the entrance free, but the wait time is much less. Ladies can get drink tickets that they can use for a certain period of time. 

If you have a party of all girls, you definitely can get inside much faster. You could possibly get a free table!! It happened to me once, but we ended up sharing it with another group. I think it depends on the day and how busy it is.

I wasn't the biggest fan of the music and since I've only been here once, I'm not sure its the norm.  It was house\/trance\/remixes that didn't include much top 40's jams.  Best way to describe it....the DJ was playing a trance remix of Adele.  ADELE.  Now, I love Adele just about everyday.  I do not love Adele in my heels and a red hot dress on the dance floor...

PROS:
1. HUGE place, inside is where the DJ lives and designated dance floor with tables around it.  There are also tables and lounge chairs outside around the Olympic size pool that you are welcome to dip your feet in (though I didn't...I find it a little unsanitary with SO many girls at the end of the night doing it because they cannot stand in their 4"" heels anymore) 

2. WALK AROUND shots available for you to buy and not have to stand in line

3. Guys are dressed up nicely ---dudes out there, you get a couple extra points for cleaning up nicely.  Some of you really don't understand how much a nice dress shirt and matching tie does to your overall look.

4. HOOK ups.  Our bachelorette group was able to get on a list and get in free 

CONS:
1. We were packed like sardines.  Not kidding.  It got SO crowded inside after 1130pm that it was reDONKulous.  Maybe it had to do with Will.i.am scheduled to guest DJ but Jesus Christ! Ever heard of fire hazard??  Plus, the dude didn't even show up until 1:30 am!

Please note the actual club itself is gorgeous. However, that doesn't give anyone the right to completely forget any form of customer service. 

LONG story short:
Had a reserved table for NYE.
Arrived at 10:30pm and were given the reserved table for a party of 12 on stage.
11:30pm - removed from the table with no explanation, sent around trying to talk to the managers to figure out what was happening. Did I mention this was NYE and all happening right before the ball drop?
11:50 - told the team of 3 that had handled our reservation was not working the night of. WHO CARES! We had emails and confirmations of the reservation. 
11:55 - the option to get a table that fits 4 behind the stage next to the pool when we had a party of 12. So yes, a table that did not fit our group nor was it anywhere near the DJ booth or dance floor.
Basically learned that someone else offered more money for our table so we were booted. We were told we would receive a refund. It is now 3 months after and we are still waiting on the refund. Atrocious. 

In the last of the 23 emails returned back and forth, this was the closing: ""Please let me know if you decide to visit again and I will personally make sure your experience is flawless."" BAHAHAHA! Right... because that is what we were told when we made our original reservation for NYE. Did I mention we planned this in September? Yes, 3 months of planning down the drain thanks to greedy club managers and owners. 

Big name DJs? Yes
Bottle Service & VIP? Yes
Huge areas to move around? Yes... however, during the high tourist months, they pack them in. Also, if you are in one spot of the club and have to get to the other side and there are crowds... give yourself 20 minutes. Not even joking. 
Great sound system? Yes

The space is HUGE and opens up into an outdoor area that is even grander and houses a large swimming pool in the center. There are private cabanas for those who want a little privacy~ although I feel like that defeats the whole purpose of being out and about and getting dolled up. For those who really came to gamble but want to stay in the same playing field as their friends, XS has blackjack tables outside as well, albeit higher limits than inside the casino. 
In the summer, my girls and I kicked off our shoes and sloshed our aching feet in the shallow end of the pool where they have lounging chairs IN the water. Every time they played my jam, we'd jump up and just dance in the water along with everyone else standing in the pool.

We waited at the bar for a little too long - for one drink and some waters (let's just say ... we had a long day). Then we seated ourselves (too tired to dance).

In the course of 5 minutes, 4 different douchebags approached us. From the crazy to the straight-up asshole, turning them away got tiring. It doesn't seem like there's a lot of screening happening here. I thought exclusivity was part of the deal? Or maybe not if you can buy your way in ...

This place is the IT place right now, and guaranteed in a year or two there will be something else that will be become the newer IT place.  So if it's your cup of tea, do it.

Tucked away in the pool area between the twin towers of the Wynn and Wynn Encore, XS is a combination indoor\/outdoor nightclub that just works on so many levels.  They open up the entire pool area for clubgoers including running the bar and casino tables in the gazebo central to the pool, offering a fantastic view no matter where you hang out and also makes for breezy summer nights.  The actual dancefloor area is always booming with pretty good music from the DJ, more than ample amounts of bar space and even the door bouncers are reasonably friendly as they seem to let most ppl in with little discrimination.  Despite being busy, service never seems gruff, snobby or elitist.

Now the pool area, since its open to clubgoers a big plus is they allow ppl to take off their shoes and dip their feet in the pool, hell maybe ppl canswim but i've never seen anyone do it, but as a result of this, ironically, you will find a majority of the girls dancing in front yet outside the main dance floor taking off their painful heels and cooling their aching foots in the pool dancing away in their short skirts, while the dance floor maybe paradoxically overloaded with men...

Weirdness aside, its always a fun time there wether its a Fri or Sat night, and cover is usually about $30 for men, less for women, but during busy holiday weekends this cover may skyrocket to $100 for men, so check this before you commit yourself to an hour wait in line or plan a backup.",0,0,1

This place is THE spot to go to right now in Vegas.  I've gone to this club twice.  The first time was a normal weekend and when we showed up with a bunch of girls we got pulled out- normal Vegas stuff but still had to pay 20 bucks.  I've seen people start waiting for this place at 8:30pm when doors open at 10pm.

Ill just list out what had happened and hopefully it helps other people out in the future if they want to go after reading all the reviews about pickpocketing.

1. We first hit up one of the promoters and asked if she could get us on the guest list. She was decently helpful and said that we would need an even ratio of guys\/girls in order for us to be on this list. Understandable...don't want a sausage fest. Also, if you do the guest list make sure you get there before 1am. The promoters are pretty much MIA at that point and the guest list doesn't exist anymore.

2. So then we decided we were gonna buy tickets online. Make sure you do this early b\/c if you decide to wait an hour or two before the club opens, the tickets will not be on sale anymore. We ended up being those people who missed the online sale by like a few min. 

3. I'm gonna laugh at point number 2 b\/c even if you have tickets you will still be waiting a good amount of time (possibly an hour or more) unless you get there right when the club opens. The only things the presale tickets are good for are that they were cheaper than general admission and they get somewhat of a priority entrance. Example: If general admission is going to wait 2 hours to get in. Presale tickets will probably wait 1hr-1.5hrs.

4. While waiting 2 hours in line (the general admission line), we were watching people bribe their way in constantly. Pretty much if you have the money and dont want to wait....that is your best option. There was a short bouncer when we were there and pretty much people were just handing him 100's constantly to get through. . Pretty sure he made enough to pay off his rent or mortgage for the next 2 months in one night. If you dont have the money, this will probably aggravate you. If it makes you stupid angry, best to just leave and go to another club. 

5. Finally made it inside after 2 hours and this is pretty much the only decent part of this review. Zedd was already an hour into his performance but it's zedd, the last 1.5 hrs of his show was great. The venue looked nice and the lighting was on point. Can't really say much for drinks but it's vegas....get ready to drop at least 20 bucks per drink. 

Pretty much....get ready to bribe your way through or go to a club right when it opens (but really who does that).",0,1,0

Got discounted guaranteed admission as guests at the Encore as long as we showed up before 11pm, which we did. Not at all crowded when we got there but was packed by midnight! Great club, fun dancing, loved the indoor\/outdoor option and the transformation of the pool area from day time party pool to night time club atmosphere. The only reason I did not give this club a 5 is that I was served the worst drink ever, and the bartender was super rude and refused to remake it! I ordered a top shelf margarita that cost $20 ($18 plus tip). I wish I had tasted it before tipping! It tasted like instead of having just salted the rim of the glass, salt was mixed into the drink itself.  It was literally undrinkable, tasted like salt water. Very disappointing from a Wynn establishment, where normally the standard of customer service is impeccable.  After that, our group of 8 did not order anymore drinks, and ended up leaving earlier than we would have liked.

We asked about bottle service and got directed to a bottle service line. We spoke to an Asian guy with a short ponytail. He looked a little stiff but was actually very polite. We told him that we're waiting on our party and planned to purchase a few bottles. He said, ""Okay. Let me know when the rest of your party gets here and we'll take care of you."" 

My party was made up one person in their late 20's. and the rest in their 40's and early 50's. My boyfriend and I were are in our early 20's. We both had to go through security four times and they asked me to recite my birthday. The DMV messed up on my man's ID by putting 5'4 when he wrote 5'9. They held him for a while but finally let him go when he pulled out additional credit cards and former school IDs. Other than that, we weren't hustled at all.

We got to our table is it's definitely both lavish looking and feeling. The seats all had an elevated flat service just high enough so that when you stood up on your seat, you can sit on it and it'll give you a better view. This was the last day of my Vegas trip so I was exhausted. I didn't get a chance to physically check out the dance floor but it was newer and cleaner looking from where I was standing than Marquee and Omnia.

I had a slight girl crush on our bottle service girl. She was a thin, short hair blonde who wore minimal make up but was very striking. She was friendly for the most part but it's probably hard to maintain an upbeat front in a loud club that is open all night. They were good on making sure our drinks and shots were topped.

Service was a good 4\/5, I don't mind coming back. I didn't have a 5\/5 wow factor though.

Again, it looks like I came in on a slow night so people might have been more easy going. I will be back in a few days for a night swim post EDC.

A group of us bought bottle service on April 26, 2014.

Crowd management was non-existent which led to drunk girls falling down on our table and table service that wasn't table service at all.  The table beside us was so close there wasn't enough room for our group and their group.  As a result, one of the people from my group and one from the table beside us got into a verbal altercation.  No violence occurred but some how our buddy, who is black, was kicked out and the  white boy from the adjacent table wasn't kicked out.  Another issue was getting back to our table after leaving the area to use the restroom.  The bouncers said there was a head account being taken and when enough people left the area my table was in, then I would be allowed to return to my table.  Extremely poor business practice considering I was at a table and paid for that service.  Not an enjoyable experience and I wouldn't recommend this club to any of my friends or colleagues who want decent bottle service at a nightclub.",1,0,0

We stayed at the Wynn one long weekend, and on Saturday night, the lobby area was SWARMING with carbon copies of barely-legals standing in a ridiculously long line in ridiculously high heels and ridiculously tight dresses just to pay whatever crazy cover charge there is to get into this place. What on earth was the appeal, i wondered.

Well, we happened to get offered some tickets to get in sans-cover, so we went...regardless of the fact that I was grossly underdressed for the affair.  There were two platforms where girls were just dancing in slinky outfits for all to watch, and the whole place was set up to make me feel like I was at a meat market.  The loud thumping, the fog, the strategically placed, scantily-clad models, and the hundreds of people who looked exactly the same all getting drunk and ""on the pull"" (is that the British term for it?) created a very cliche club environment for me.

The one cool thing was that an entire wall was missing, giving the ability to see outside and making you feel like you were at  swanky outdoor club.

Perhaps I'm just not social enough to appreciate a good club when I see one, but we stayed 30 minutes and then left for some jack^2 (black and daniels, that is).",6,4,2

The funky rule with all Vegas clubs is basically that men have to get a table.  Without the bottle service, not only our fellow male homo sapiens cannot attract female mates, they are simply denied the chance to even enter the arena.  

Which makes me happy from time to time to be a girl.

Our huge co-ed group came up with a strategy: Men get table, women get free admission fliers and enter the club separately.  Men drink their overpriced alcohol and have a booth to actually ""sit down"" with their friends, and women buy from the bar and sit with the men to avoid harassment from random douchebags.  

So free admission+3 drinks for $40 from the bar (which is really not so bad)+crazy dance floor with good music+being around friends+a place to sit when my heels started to hate my feet+a brief encounter with the pole on the platform above our booth....  How could this not be fun, 5-star fun?

Tables were wide and spacious, and the benches\/mats set into the pool were wonderful. Once your feet are tired, taking a dip and dancing in the water is fun too. Just don't dive in, as you will be escorted out by the bouncers. Music is wonderful--I rarely have a bad night when it comes to music at XS. Poles are located inside to twirl around if you got the skills (but please don't if you don't know how...you'll just embarass yourself). 

I came for Afrojack and he blew my mind! Amazing DJ, chilling by the pool with my (watered down) drink, and watching pretty visuals on the screens outside was just great.

It's a huge rip off which leaves you ""pre exhausted"" from the maze from hell which loops you around and around. 

The club itself is spacious with room to dance plus it offers the ability to dance to your favorite Dj's as well as pre-buy your tickets.

However we never did get to see nor dance to David Guetta whom we Pre bought tickets to a month ago. Stood inline for nearly one hour beginning at 10pm. Problem with this U ask? Tickets clearly say 10pm start time but they didn't even allow entry until nearly 11om. At nearly 1am David Guetta still hadn't appeared so we cut bait and bailed back to the room as the Dj was mixing way to fast and the music lacked flow and rhythm. 

I'm now over Guetta as well as his techno music as the disrespect shown by him as well as how this club is run is atrocious.

After finally being able to get to the line to check our name off the list we were ""helped"" by Fee, the (hostess? I don't know the term) girl who was standing with a list in her hand. She had just finished helping someone so we assumed we would go to her. 

We stood there and waited as she went through her little booklet and NO ONE acknowledged us. There were two other girls standing next to her and one girl behind us. Fee continued to stand there with a look on her face like someone had just kicked her dog. 

Look, I work in customer service and I get it, sometimes it sucks helping people but you need to leave your baggage at the door and do you job. She finally looks over at us and says ""did she help you yet."" Um, who is she and obviously not because we are standing here and not going inside. 

She was rude and just a terrible person to have working the front of the line. Totally killed the mood.

Now, XS is freaking gorgeous. It's huge with multiple bars and the security guards aren't super pissy and mean like they are at other clubs in Vegas. 

First bartender made strong drinks, second  one did not. Drinks are typical Vegas prices running $15-$20 a pop.

Typical EDM music. They played hip-hop for a good 45 minutes which was the highlight of my night. Got super crowded super quick.",1,2,0

This place buries what Hollywood and West LA have to offer, simply due to the enormous interior of this club, and even so, it still got packed!

The entrance to this place is located in between XS and Encore, it is not in Encore itself, but closer to the Wynn Theater area. When I first walked into the club, I was blown away by the size of this place. The pool is also a very nice touch to a club, however I did realize that this pool is probably the same pool and patio area used during the daytime for poolside activities.

The club itself must have been about 40k sq. ft. or so, and boasted a plethora of seats and booths for the big groups of people wanting prime real estate next to the dance floor. The dance floor itself was disappointingly smaller than what, in my opinion, should have been a much larger dance floor. 

I enjoyed the drinks, although I did not enjoy racking up a $73 tab for one round of drinks with a group of five, but that's the drawback of clubbing at such a nice spot. The bartenders were very friendly and attentive. The girl I had even asked me if I wanted water for one of my lady friends...which I've never seen before. 

The pool water is warm and you're welcomed to dip your feet into the stairs leading to the pool, however you will be kicked out in a heartbeat if you attempt to jump in!

Cover for us was free since we went through our friend's host, however the second night we payed $30 for the guys and $20 for the girls, although the much-informed flyers for free female entrances could not be found, thanks to all the local hype about Beyonce's presence. 

Two stars off for this idiotic bouncer who was on a very apparent power-trip who hassled us for our friend who jokingly took his shirt off. We did deserve to be hassled, but the level of obnoxiousness and the bouncer's exaggeration wasn't necessary. A big thanks to his manager who shut him up and let us stay.",2,0,0

I was here last Saturday when Steve Angelo of Swedish House Mafia performed. There was no guest list so we had to buy pre-sale tickets ~ $20 for girls\/$50 for guys. We got there at about 10:30 and the line went by really quickly. I liked the set up of the club, the stage was indoors and facing a large dance floor surrounded by the table-service area. The back of the stage was open to the pool\/outdoor dance area, which was nice since you still got to hear the live DJ  even if you were outdoors. The drinks were good, strong, and expensive... as expected. Music was great and Steve Angelo's performance was AMAZING! The only downside was that when the indoor dance floor gets packed, they block off the entrances from the pool... this forced us to exit the club and re-enter from the front just to get inside, kinda sucky but whatever!

I like to dance. On a Friday night, I discovered that you will not be able to dance here. The dance floor is a small circular section in a vast club. I guarantee that you will be continuously pummeled by a group of strangers. Granted, they are a diverse and very good-looking group (lot of Middle Easterners and Asians). Crowding two hundred nice people into a hundred-foot-wide circle has a way of making them mean people. In a group of three, I found it nearly impossible to leave or reenter the dance floor when the club really began hopping after midnight. 

Granted, it is beautiful inside. But a nightclub really needs to have a decent dancefloor, and this one occupies a fraction of the total space. I'm not one to sit around and try to talk over the booming music at a club. WAY too much space is taken up by private tables and the silly pool, which is beautiful but an essentially pointless ornament. The floor space is also arbitrarily divided up by stupid obstructions like random stripper poles, which various female customers were grinding on. Shouldn't they have been paid, rather than paying to get in? Don't understand it.

If cover is going to be $30, if you are going to wait an hour to get in, and if low-wattage drinks are $15, then you expect something amazing. That it wasn't.

Music was passable. Heavy on the uber-mixxxed hip-hop, which is fine, though with computer technology the way it is nowadays, the art of dj-ing is essentially passé. Heard better.

I can't imagine anyone having fun here unless his name is Bobby Bottleservice.",4,2,2

I don't even know where to begin with this review. So much going on in one night! We were approached by a promoter on the strip on a Monday afternoon, and although we were a bit sceptical at first, it turned out to be a very good decision. (FYI, this review is in the perspective of a lady for ladies. Gotta help a sister out!) 

Upon arrival, we were given one free drink ticket to the Botello bar next door to XS where all the promoters were waiting with their groups of ladies. (I know, it sounds sketchy... that's just Vegas for you.) When we got in line, we were given 2 more drink tickets for inside the club. Finally got inside XS and taken to our table! They kind of herded us in the tables (bit weird) and started with rounds of Moet champagne, which was followed by Grey Goose & juices to mix in. Mind you this was separate from the 2 free drink tickets. My advice: yes, it's fancy and free, but don't drink it all. There are some creepers lurking in the crowd below. I was really glad I stopped while I was ahead.

Feeling a bit weird sitting up on those couches like we were on display, we moved down to the dance floor in front of the stage. Excellent decision. Morgan Page came on minutes after and we danced and danced and danced. Awesome DJ! XS also threw out these glow stick things into the crowd (which apparently is a pretty regular thing). Although there are your typical creepy club guys in the crowd, there are plenty of normal people and lots of other girls to dance with. We ended up having a fantastic time.    

XS is so good, it has ruined all other dance clubs for me! Seriously. It makes me sad.

Advice for the Ladies: Monday night is best! Find a promoter (they'll be on the strip, so don't ignore them) and get on the guest list for free table service!",8,2,1

We went straight for the bar when we got there and it was crazy just trying to get drinks. I got a workout just trying to get drinks. The drinks were expensive, but hey, it's Vegas, what do you expect? I got two drinks, so I didn't have to make the trip to the bar again. We were going to walk around a little to try and find a spot to dance, which ended up being a bad idea. There were tons of people trying to get around the pool and it was such a mess. And of course, there were some ratchets dancing right in the area where people were trying to get through. Seriously?! Go dance somewhere else, people are trying to get by. It took us about 10 minutes to walk 4 feet. I had people pushing me, I got beer on me, and I think in my drink too, because my drink tasted awful after that. After we got through that mess, we stayed maybe half an hour more before we were over it. Had a much better time at other clubs.",0,0,1

Everything is glam about this place w\/a modern 70's twist (the gold glitz and classy decor, and the go-go dancers' gold sequin dresses). Its sister club, Tryst, had a big hit with the stripper pole, well XS stepped it up and added it all over the place... and both girls and guys love the stripper poles -- it's just alot of fun! Again, everything about this place is glam, sexy (not trashy). Bouncers have been nice except for the ones that run the door... it's their job to be assholes =)

This place has a huge pool so I can't wait until the rumored night pool parties!

Like any other place in Vegas, don't go during holidays -- it's the worst experience. You won't have fun even if you have a table because when you want to walk around it will be elbow to elbow and can't get anywhere. Vegas during holidays in general is just a nightmare.

Besides the buffets, XS was the highlight of my Vegas trip but that's also dependent on whether or not you get in. Even if you think you're early, you aren't. When we got there around 10:30, before it opened, the line was already wrapped around the hallway. When did people start lining up? 8?

Our general admission comp tickets meant that we had to wait in a separate line in a different area of the hotel....far away from the actual entrance. And due to our lack of connections in Vegas, we were probably going to be standing for awhile, or so I thought.

We stood in line for another 10 minutes and watched as more people piled behind us, stretching even further down the hall-and the line was not even budging. Right about when I had enough, a staff member approached us: ""1 girl and 1 guy, right?"" We nodded and he led us quickly out of the line and towards the entrance.

It was as if the Red Sea had parted right before us as we walked past the mile-long line. Once we were inside, we realized we were surrounded by bachelorettes and their entourages. Everyone was dressed to the nines and all the staff members were fit and gorgeous. The pool was open that night (Sunday) but there were only a handful of people swimming.They had BJ tables outside by the pool and the dance floors (outdoors and indoors) were SO crowded. Drinks are marked up as usual. Music is....questionable so we just mostly people watched. Unlike PURE, there are actually places to sit albeit they are small ledges of pots and plants but I'm not complaining especially when I'm wearing 5 inch death traps. 

I'm already planning for another visit on my next trip to Vegas. You're guaranteed a good time at XS! If you're not with a group of girls then dress to impress if you want to cut the line!",0,1,1

Everything about this club was hip... just right for not-so-single ladies who wanted to fist pump pool-side... to 'old-school' meets 'new-school' hip\/hop\/pop\/rock.

Seating came easy for those of us who were creative and easy to please, as we substituted table service lounge chairs for 'really big planters' that afforded a place to rest our sore little feet... and sore little feet is exactly what we all had after hours of happy-dancing - before finally calling it quits in the wee hours of a Sunday morning.

The dance floor is fairly small and gets packed extremely easy when bigger artists come. I'd say the drink prices are ""overpriced,"" but that's obvious when going to any club on the strip, lol. 

The pool was the best part of the club, to be honest, and even then, it's not the best pool club in Las Vegas. It has typical club standards for dress most of the time and it's best to arrive a little earlier, especially if bigger artists are going to be there.

The negatives start with the entrances. We had prepay tickets which made things go fast once we found the entrance. But we had to swing all of the way around to the back of this big club, and signage was not that great.

Once in, you can expect to pay a hefty price for drinks, but that's how it is at any of the top clubs in Vegas.

First club I've ever been into in vegas. Got there early and was on the guest list. We were told girls would get in for free. It was winter and freezing outside. We just wanted to get inside to warm up. Then we realized that our ""guest list"" only got us into the outdoor part of the club. We weren't going to put up with that. 

We asked the bouncer how to get inside. He said we needed to get a stamp that is free. We just need to talk to the bar. We went to the bar he pointed at and the barista told us to go to the center bar in the middle of the pool. We went there and the barista looked confused & told us that we couldn't get the stamp here. This continued for an hour. We were walking left & right to figure out who to talk to because no one knew who we were supposed to talk to. Eventually someone tells us we are supposed to talk to a promoter. But of course, no promoter in sight. No promoter answering texts. It's as if they didn't exist. We found the cashier at the entrance and she said that they stopped letting people in. Girls had to pay $75. We were furious! She said the longer we wait, the higher the price was going to get. After a couple minutes of debating we decided to pay. 

We got inside and the venue was nice. The drinks were expensive! We got half a glass of ice & what should be Long Island ice tea for $20 each! 

People in the club were rude! One girl kept pushing me so I was constantly shoving my elbow into her back so she could give me some space. Someone smashed my toe on the dance floor so a piece of skin was hanging off. And my friend got into a fight with a guy that was definitely on something. 

We left the club early because of the fight but the guy that was on drugs started following us & wouldn't leave us alone. We had to call security on him twice! 

In all. It was a terrible experience. I spent half the time trying to get in and half the time trying to leave. The management sucked and the people that attend the club were incredibly rude. I paid $75 when I was told I would pay $0.

As the only night that XS was open during our visit was Monday (slooooow...), my friend and I tried to get free passes.  We witnessed the complete absence of any line the day before - the only people creating any action at the entrance were some twenty bouncers in ill-fitting black suits.  Tried the concierge at the Encore who gave us a stare full of contempt and offered tickets for $50 for two.  We then proceeded down the Esplanade towards the Wynn to talk to the promoter who was trying to stay alert at the podium in front of the club with very little resort traffic.  The first thing he asked us was what hotel we were staying at.  And when we unsuspectingly answered that were staying next door at the Encore, he informed us that the resort had prohibited them from giving any free passes to the Wynn-Encore guests, I guess in an effort to extract additional revenue from every hotel patron.  If we would have said we were staying at the Luxor, then maybe he could have helped us. We were kind of offended by the treatment at the Wynn, and ventured along the other Esplanade out on the strip and decide what to do later that night.  As we were riding up the escalator towards the bridge to the Palazzo, we saw a bunch of free XS passes scattered all over.  We couldn't believe that these hypocrites were trying to get a good-looking, well-dressed couple to pay $50 while scattering free passes all over town just to get some village idiots (on those later) to show up for free? Moreover, it was an Industry Night that Monday...

Well, we did take advantage of the free passes.  The décor and the setting are gorgeous (thus 3 stars).  Beware, however, of the heaters by the free tables in the pool area.  They keep them really hot - we had to ask security to lower the heat twice since we both started to sweat - and it was mid-40's outside.  I don't think they want you to occupy the free seats for too long - they would rather see you done with your drink fast and go spend $15 on the next one.  The dance floor crowd was pathetic - an old guy with a grey ponytail was doing robot moves in front of one of the go-go girl platforms.  A painfully unattractive girl in some frilly circus outfit with a bare midriff was trying hog the entire dance floor.  Awkward... Honestly, I do not know how the ""hottest"" night club on the strip would even let in some of the characters we observed that night.  Is this what Industry Night is about? Not sure...There were plenty of single middle-aged men in blazers and sleazy younger gigolos with their shirt collars out.  By midnight some younger women started to arrive.  But, overall, the crowd was truly uninspiring.  Maybe on Fridays and Saturdays this place gets more selective, but even then, I am not sure what they charge $20\/$30 for.

One of our girls got us on the guest list and we got 2 free drinks each. The only issue I had was this girl who was checking us off the guest list, she was super awkward.  So, my friend complimented her hair, and she touched it, and told her how beautiful she was, then the girl was like, ""ma'am, please don't touch my hair."" Ok, I could understand that, personal space, but then she was like, ""I gotta get away from this girl, she's freakin' me out."" I can't really believe that's the worst situation the girl has been in, I mean, she works in the entertainment industry and although I don't believe she shouldn't be touched how she doesn't want to be touched, I think she could've just handled the situation better instead of possibly embarrassing my friend, if she were the type to be embarrassed.

My friends and I were here Friday night for Avicii, and Saturday night for Madeon. Both nights were cray-cray, filled with the classiest drunk people ever. People were breaking out pocket squares and cufflinks left and right, while downing bottles of Absolut.

It's $50 to get in as a guy on a ""normal"" club night, and more for well-known DJs. Chicks get in for like $20.

I'd say make sure you arrive early, but honestly, there's a crap ton of people at all times. The wait might be anywhere from 30-60 minutes, so I recommend buying tickets online beforehand. You can also jump the line if you slip the door people a Benjamin. 

The drinks aren't too expensive ($13-15 for mixed drinks), but stay away from bottle service. The venue itself is huge, with tables to the side, surrounding the dance floor and stage. Also, there will be bouncers preventing people from reaching the dance floor if it reaches ""capacity,"" which basically means half full. We were lucky enough to get through by slipping the dude a $20, but I think he just assumed it was a $100, and let us through.

It's a bit ridiculous that they block you out from the dance floor, but if you can overlook that, and are able to sneak through\/buy your way in, you will be in for a great night.",2,1,0

Cover was pretty much the same as Drai's, $30 for Guys and $20 for the Ladies, however they do have promoter specials that allows a girl to bring a guy in with no charge (1:1).  

The bartenders here were friendly, fast and smiled!  The drinks were reasonably priced, $12 for rail drinks, $15 for premium.  We didn't order any shot or beers at this location, so no prices for you guys...

The crowd seemed younger, more chill and not so uptight, making this place a lot more fun and easier to mingle and socialize.  BUT if you want an EDM style dance floor, go to Drai's.

I'm trying to figure out why this place works.. here's my oh-so-deep analysis:
There are a few reasons people decide to leave clubs, but all those problems have solutions at XS:

PROBLEM: Too stuffy
SOLUTION: The circulation is amazing at XS given that one whole wall is gone from the already large, high ceiling-ed club. You never feel stuffy, no matter how vigourously you dance! 

PROBLEM: Too sober, but too cheap to buy yo-self another drink
SOLUTION:  There is no roped off VIP section at XS, so you can freely mingle with those-who-have-table-service. Which increases the chance of you getting invited over to get plastered, for free. 

PROBLEM: Too pained by your shoes
SOLUTION: This is probably the most unique part of XS: there is a pool area, where you can take off your shoes, take a dip, and juuuust dance.",4,3,1

Award winning DJ's? 
Hot go-go dancers?

XS is all that packaged up in to the hottest, most sophisticated and lush nightclub I've ever stepped foot in to. This is what Vegas is about. Every other club in Vegas fails, miserably, in comparison.

I repeat, very crowded.  

I have never had so much trouble moving from one end of the club to the other.  ANYWAY.  

We got here around 10:30, and got in right away because we were all girls, so they pulled us from the line.  Oh, the line, by the way, is ridiculous.  I would never, ever, ever wait in that line.  I'm glad we were with all girls.  We got in right away and proceeded to check out the inside of the club.  Lots of people, bars were very crowded, and the dance floor was packed.

Drinks, as always, are very expensive, so beware.  But there are plenty of people that will buy you them. Haha.  

One of my FAVORITE things about this club is that you can go outside, get some fresh air, and take off your heels and wade in the water.  It feels glorious on aching feet, and it always feels nice to sit down from time to time.  

One of my LEAST FAVORITE things about this club is the music isn't diverse.  Other clubs I have been to will mix up the music a bit, but this place is mostly techno\/house mixes of songs.  I absolutely loved when they played hip-hop and top 40' s stuff, but the DJ that was there the night we were wasn't that impressive.

The girls just dipped their feet in and some girl was so drunk she freakin' missed a step and completely fell in, yikes! Don't walk near there if you're drunk or you're gonna look silly.

You can't wait for your friends either outside as I guess it distracts from the club environment. 

When we first arrived at XS there weren't that many people on the dance floor or at the bar. The outside patio area was nice as it was pretty spacious. 

After coming back around 12:30PM (we went to the casino to hang out to gamble and drink), this place was packed. There was a separate line to go to once you had the wristbands (bypassed all of the other people in line). You couldn't move 3 feet without someone bumping into you and pushing you.  The music was bumping though as it was my kind of music. The dance\/house music, top 40 hits and the remixes were awesome! The DJ that was spinning that night was spinning some PHAT jams.

Our party was on the guest list (13 girls and 7 guys) and made our way into the club no problem. We made our way to the dance floor where there was another line where the club was ensuring that the inside floor wasn't filled over capacity. At that point the guard at the front of the line let a majority of our girls in, and declined to let us guys and one of our girls in. He offered no explanation. He turned his back to us while letting upwards of 20 people into the interior dance floor while we waited there. He wouldn't acknowledge us. 

Was he picking which girls he'd let onto the floor and which ones he for some reason didn't think deserve to be in there? And why weren't we allowed onto the dance floor while others were? No explanation was offered. As a guest of the club, I felt completely disrespected.

The best part is the heated pool. All you lovely ladies in 5 inch pumps know what I'm talking about. It's the closest thing to heaven for our cute feet. Just take your shoes off, dip, and show off those pedicures.  I've seen some people bring swimsuits and went in for the dive.  Mostly guys though.  Girls tend to want to keep their makeup on.

For those who had an affinity for gambling, they have casino tables set up right beside the pool. Why buy drinks when you can get it for free at the tables?  My friends have been very lucky everytime they go here--and it's a different kind of luck than what most people are looking for going to clubs.  More practical =)

Blackjack tables run $15 minimums so not bad on a busy weekend where the casino floor has mostly $20 minimums. Just play a few hands and pound drinks from the waitress rather than pay $15\/drink at the bar. Might as well try to win some right?",0,0,0

I'll review both here and I'll start by saying XS is my favorite club in Las Vegas considering overall experience.

First, the main club is pretty great. The floor is not that large, but it never got too packed and the sound system is great. The lights are pretty immersive and there are a variety of lighting effects that came through where I felt really into it. Skrillex played a great show and I didn't seem that bummed to miss Avicii. There's a very large outdoor area, which is what makes XS so great, as it's awesome to go outside to get some fresh air and maybe play some tables that they have in the club. Re-entry is also a cakewalk, which is an underrated but great quality to have for a club (Tip: if you leave the main club and go outside, don't wait in the lines to go back into the club, just go out of the club and re-enter through the front). I had no complaints at all from the Friday night show.

Monday night was the nightswim with Skrillex and Diplo. This was my second nightswim (previously did Wet Republic with Tiesto) and XS was on another level. The pool actually had people actively partying with giant beach balls, blown up animals, etc. There was alot of space to maneuver in the pool and it was all in all a very fun time. The drawbacks of being in the pool, though, are that the sound is not that full in the pool. It would be nice to be a little bit louder to have a better party, but it's understandable due to the club size. Also, lots and lots of nasty things happen in the pool. I'm quite sure I saw a few people having sex and I think I brushed up on a few used condoms (yeah, very nasty), so it's not for everyone. I would definitely do it again, though, because it's so unique.

All in all, I think XS is the best club experience overall in Vegas. It doesn't have the best decor (Omnia), DJ effects\/lighting (Light\/Omnia), or location, but it's great in every aspect and will always be a great time.",2,2,1

When I first came here in its first year run, I thought the vibes, decor, and overall crowd was fantastic. It represented everything I could dream of in a Las Vegas club. Big, glamorous, fun, and... Crackin' !! I've been here a few times over the year and my most current visit last weekend shattered my opinion, thus resulting me to write this review. 

I went with my girlfriends on a Friday night and arrived around 1130pm, walking in to a packed dance floor. That is of course expected.  Because it was so packed, we decided to mingle outside.  On our way there, I already saw a couple on the floor grinding up on eachother. Get a room please, you don't need to dry hump on the damn dance floor! 

After reaching outside, I saw a girl straddling a guy on the couch while making out with him.  To some, seeing these kind of sights upon arrival may foretell a crazy and happening place, but for me, I personally was a bit overwhelmed! I am all for love in the club, but somehow, I was further put off by this along with the jam packed dance floor. 

The last thing I must mention is the lack of diversity of the crowd.  I love my peoples, but I prefer diverse crowds when it comes to partying. The crowd that comes here is pretty much 95% a-z-n!

Okay that was corny as hell but basically...

I've been here for bottle service and non-bottle service shenanigans, and both times were hella fun. The bottle service is very efficient but a tad expensive. but bleh it's nothing less than what you'd expect for bottle service in Vegas. The lady was super attentive, and I don't know why but do they always have to put pens and credit cards in their cleavage?? We got upgraded for free to a larger table right next to the dance floor so that was pretty dope. Some table also made it rain the last time I was there, and we ended up copping enough dollars to get a free cab ride home for me and my girls. whaaat it dooo.

Even if you don't get uber expensive bottle service, don't have ratio, you can still get in this club. If you get there at 10, you usually get into the club at 10:40 and on a busy weekend, you'd get in at 11:20. At least you're pretty much guaranteed to eventually get in though. And there seems to be plentiful of females in there :-D. 

I don't think you need bottle service at this place, plenty of places to sit and everything is so spacious. The place is HUGE. The outside area is for lounging, and inside is for dancing.

The music is pretty wack. It goes from Hip hop to house back to hip hop. The DJ doesn't seem to know what he's doing in terms of music. However, everyone just really bumps and grinds it, so I don't think anyone really cares.

There was one time where they closed the outside area. Without the outside area, XS totally sucks and I wouldn't recommend going. But if the pool area is open, this place is crazy beyond belief. You can even jump into the pool to soak your feet or dance with any of the females you usually see in there :).",1,0,0

The venue was stunning, and you entered through the side of the club, from the outside area so you had the perfect view of the dance floor, pool area, and gambling tables.  The dance floor was open, so you could look out over the pool and at the Wynn and Encore while enjoying the music.  The best part was, there was a lot of space to navigate because you could walk right off the floor to the outside patio area. 

However, going back a second time after the changes they made to the venue, I got a totally different impression.  They've since closed off the floor, so now you have to go through a door either on the left or right sides of the club to get to the inside or outside part of the club.  Also, the club was extremely overcrowded, and bottlenecked at those two spots.  The floor was packed, enough room to stand and move up and down but not really dance.  When our group got separated the people tried to get back inside, the bouncers were actually blocking the doors, and requesting bribes in order to get back  in.  This is after dropping $50 cover for guys, and $20 for ladies.  This went on for about an hour before people were finally about to move around again.

Definitely a 5 star rating hands down after the first experience.  Now, it gets a 3.  I don't know why they made the changes they did, but please bring back the old XS!",4,0,0

Michelle put my party on the XS guest list and confirmed our attendance an hour before via text.

Like everyone else here, every single time I go, all of my friends and I have an AMAZING time with great stories to come out of it. XS did it right! They got everyone to love their club and because everyone is happy walking in, the vibe is just that much better and crazier than other clubs. The atmosphere and everyone's attitude really is noticeably different than that of other clubs like TAO or Marquee. Keep at it XS! Keep your resident DJ who plays bangin beats all night long and keep making those drinks tasty and strong. 

I came here once to see Afrojack; the club was off the chaaiiinn crazy. Make sure you come Saturday nights. It's definitely the most poppin compared to friday or sunday. And another thing: I have never seen a club so well stocked in stripper poles! They know how to provide entertainment to the fine drunk ladies and men. 

Another awesome thing XS does is provide wheelchairs!! I don't know if it is common or regular for other clubs to do this, because I've only seen it done here (and I guess it says something about how awesome of a time people are having...). Yup, if you or your drunkass friend can't stand, they aren't quick and rude to push you out and let you stumble and fall on your way home.

Also, there are reserved seating areas for bottle service, beer pong tables at the back, and a few hot tubs for your close interactions. 

If you bring your phone, be very weary. You can easily drop it or loose it in the midst of this crazy place. Drunk people in bathing suits having fun and listening to some of the best electronic artists of our age is probably a very minimal description of this fantastic place. 

We got into the club for $20, but that's because we booked tickets online in advance, probably 2-3 weeks before coming to Vegas. Trust me, for the money you spend getting in, it's a complete bargain.

I'm sure that club is one of, maybe the best club in Vegas.

The DJ was also 1000x better and the crowd was way more diverse.
some highlights (since you can probably read all the other stuff elsewhere)

1) 2 chicks violently humping each other and mounting each other in the pool.  WTF?  One of which definitely wasn't wearing undies and probably should have...
2) Jumping on the beds =)
3) Some girl trying to knock me into the pool.  UNSUCCESSFULLY 
4) A friend tried to bribe our way in, (worked at Tryst) we got VIP but it didn't cover our entry.  Lame.  It was kind of funny though.
5) Dancing barefoot in the pool

I came here for Veteran's Day weekend on a Sunday night. Surprisingly, the line seemed pretty packed, but that didn't deter most of us. It seems like a long wait from the outside, but the cashiers are very efficient and the wait was no more than 20 min. Definitely tolerable, especially with a Four Loko in your hand.

$20 for guys, free for girls if you're on the guest list. If I knew what it would be like inside, I would've easily paid more.

The venue is absolutely gorgeous. The fact that the dance floor is centralized makes it easy to get around, unlike the dark mazes of Marquee. Everything from the chandelier to the bathroom walls to the bar is beautifully crafted and makes you feel just a little bit classier. Plus, there's actually places to sit! That's pretty rare to find these days. 

That night, R3hab was DJing and it was one of the most mind-blowing clubbing experiences of my life. I've never heard of the guy before, but he mixed in a good amount of popular EDM music along with his stuff. It's almost as if you're at a rave, but with a lot less people and a much nicer venue. Free shirts, styrofoam glow sticks, and glasses made it even better. Even if you're not into EDM, the DJs they host here will make sure you're having a good time.

The crowd is predominantly young, classy and good looking. Everyone tends to be friendly and not trying to start shit. You might run into a few bros or hood rats here and there, but it's a lot less likely to happen than at Marquee or Tao. You'll also see some cougars, but hey props to them for staying young and enduring 4 hours of head-blasting music. 

Overall, XS is the perfect place to go clubbing in Vegas. There's really no other way to put it. Even if you swear to never go clubbing again like I almost did after Marquee, you won't regret giving it a chance.",6,1,3

The bouncers think they are nightlife gods & need to lighten up, but once you're inside it's all positive vibes from there on out. 

There is a cover of 20-25$ but girls should have no problem getting on a free guest list when strolling the strip...just don't fall for any scams that ask you to purchase admission passes! As for guys, you might just have to pay cover..sucks to live in a sexist society, doesn't it?

Anyways, the place is spacious and luxurious. There is an indoors dance floor & tables (bottle service only) as well as a huge outdoors with a pool, full bar, and private cabanas as well. 

I like the music selections...they play more Euro\/House type stuff than the average club, yet there is still plenty of popular hits to bounce around to 

Not sure if XS is just my lucky charm, but I always find some eye-candy at this place! 

The place does get packed so if you like your space, stick with the outdoors.

The layout of the club allows for an amazing dayclub and nightclub experience.  The DJ booth is centered between both venues and you can hear the music from just about anywhere without it being too overwhelming.

The ambiance is definitely classy and upscale without being too over the top.  You have your fair share of risqué outfits and more conservative clubbing attire. The staff does a good job of keeping travel lanes clear and open as well as policing up any riff-raff.

Seating is limited, like most clubs are, and table\/bottle service can be pricey.  If you're able to find a good host, they can typically work with you to find a reasonable deal.  Just take into account lead time and if there are special events happening that night to avoid any sticker shock. We decided to ditch Drai's club when the potential host quoted an out the door price of $5200 for 25 people at the ""hottest club in world"". No brainer. NEXT!

As expected, the club was packed on a Saturday night and the dance floor was even more packed.  For those not wanting to brave the crowded dance floor, there was enough ""dance space"" outside. 

I was there with a group of about 20 folks and we were able to find a space on the main dance floor.  Eventually our spacing grew less and less, but we did manage to avoid being smashed like sardines.

Cost to get in may seem high but there are other places charging more and compared to others, the price was reasonable for the atmosphere. My friends had a blast at XS for their high school reunion and memories they will take with them that will last a lifetime!",17,10,16

We got to the club early - 10:30pm. My boyfriend and I were told to stand on line and separate - guys from girls. I got in for free (nobody ever mentioned an additional cover) and he ended up paying $60 for admission to both the outside and inside areas. So we went in and tried to go inside to the main concert part, but were told that We cannot get in because I did not have an inside stamp, and we were redirected to several people before being told that we both need to pay additional cover to be allowed inside. So we went back to the general admission line and ended up paying $30 for me to get inside. Then we went back to the line to get inside and, long story short, we waited an hour and a half.  Meanwhile, other groups (of guys and girls) got in immediately with no wait. I ended up getting really annoyed and leaving the line.

The first bad experience I had here was last year when my friends and I got on the guest list under a promoter named Michelle. She said we'd get in free before a certain time (girls & guys).  When we got there, they said the guest list entrance is only good for the outside patio area where all you get to see is the back of the DJs head and have to stand outside in the freezing cold (this was during the winter time). To get inside the actual club, you have to pay. 
Now I'm not complaining about the free entry, but it's really misleading saying that entrance is free when it really isn't.  

Now the second time... This was last week on January 1, 2017. My friends and I drove from LA just for the night so we could see Marshmello. From our previous experience, we made sure to buy tickets online so we wouldn't have to go through the same hassle as before. So we all bought our $50 tickets online, got to the club around 10:45pm, waited in line for about 1.5 hours until we decided to leave because they said they were at ""capacity"" and it was freezing outside. Mind you, we were about 7 people away from the front of the line. And all they kept saying is ""we're at capacity"". Once they're at ""capacity"" they don't let anyone in unless you buy a $5k table... People won't start getting let in again until the DJ finishes his\/her set. WTF!

Why do you oversell tickets XS????

The only good thing about that night was we got to see Marshmello walk right in front of us while we were waiting in line. ha!

They don't offer refunds, so if this happens to you, your best bet is to call your CC company, dispute the charge, and say that you were offered a service which you did not receive. I have Wells Fargo and they were great at handling this request!

I'm told the owner or designer of this club is from Miami so they based the decor off of Miami clubs. And if this is what Miami clubs are like I definitely want to go party there! It's a more open club because the dance floor opens up into the pool area. And not a tiny little balcony like Tryst, but you can walk around the pool and sit outside to get some air or a smoke. That was always my one complaint about clubs is how hot they get and how they need more ventilation especially when it gets PACKED. Everyone just gets super sweaty and that's no fun. it's definitely a classy place and an awesome club. 

I've been told by friends that in the spring\/summer times (the season I don't go because Vegas is too hot for me), is when they have ""pool party club nights"" at XS. I don't really get how that works, you go clubbing in your bikini then? Or you just hang around the pool? Not sure how that works but kinda cool they're mixing it up.

I think the venue is too small for a big crowd and since XS has gained a lot more people the passed few years it's been open, this is probably why it's so crowded. I understand that the Encore has 3 clubs in it and needs to share the space for the others, but I think they need to expand for the top resident DJs that they're hosting.

XS isn't a place you're going to walk into and have to wade through a massive anxiety-inducing crowd to get anywhere.  I'm sure once upon a time it might have been, but because of the outdoor pool area you can always escape for some fresh air.  There's also plenty of room to dance out there!

It gets very packed here, and I dont think they should let it get that crowded to be honest. Just so there is enough room to maneuver and what not. But if your into raves and mosh pits, this place would suite you dearly.

If you're looking to celebrate and get your party on, i highly recommend this club.

Located inside Steve Wynn's Encore Hotel and Resort, the club was buzzing with party goers crammed in a line that appeared to have no end!

To forgo the line, we opted for bottle service with Goose and it was worth every penny!  If you're a dude, plan on paying bottle or slipping the usher a few $$$, that's just how they roll in Vegas.  When in Rome, folks!

With that said, there was still a bit of a frustrating wait inside the club for our table.  Once we got past all that BS, we did indeed land a great table...with a POLE! 

The girls got right up there as soon as we arrived and the party was officially on! The club was huge but oddly enough it was shoulder to shoulder on the dance floor and pretty much everywhere else!  This place was packed, but truth be told, who wants to go to an empty club anyways?! 

A great mix of Top 40 music was blasting with a heavy bass from the large speakers throughout and the club opened out to a beautiful pool area where folks were partying it up outside, as well. 

From there, drinks were up and the evening slowly became a distant blur.
Ok, I recall more than that, but am i actually gonna tell ya? 

Heck no!

Standing in line, you people watch all the beautiful people waiting to be seen and critiqued. That was fun. Male cover was $30 on a Friday night. Not bad for Vegas I suppose... ladies were $20 unless you had a pass that you could easily pick up off the street or any store. 

When we got in, it looked very impressive. There weren't any hallways to walk through, rather it was a big open space with chandeliers and stripper poles. Even farther back, it opens up into the pool area where you can walk around and play blackjack and craps. All the available poolside seats are definitely NOT going to be sold out to people, so after a while just have a seat and make yourself seem baller. 

The group I went with loved everything about this place. The line to get in wasn't so long. The drinks weren't THAT expensive relative to other pretentious clubs. The ambiance was awesome. And the crowd was very nice to look at.

The line is freakin' ridiculous and I refuse to wait in that damn thing.  Is it worth it though?  Yes!  

The club is gorgeous and there is a pool in there for you to dance in!  Actually, you can't go too deep, but it is nice to soak your feet in the water after a long night of dancing in 5 inch heels.  I must warn you though... soaking your feet in the water will cause it to expand so don't be surprised if your shoes don't fit afterwards.  LOL!

There are table games inside of the club.  Yeah... when the girls and I were dancing our butts off, the guys sort of ditched us for the craps table.  Whatever though because my Husband came up, so he has my blessings and my purses'!  :D

The only thing that I hated was the fact that it was TOOOOOO crowded.  I swear I felt like I was going to pass out trying to make it to the door to leave.  

Don't be surprised if you walk past a nasty couple with someone's hands up someone's skirt.  Yes, this did happen and apparently, its the norm because security didn't do anything about it.  Who am I kidding?  He was probably enjoying it!  YUCK.

Still gets a five star though because I didn't have to wait in line and I had a great time and my Husband won some money and I got y dance on and got a free show (lol).

TIP:  Don't believe when they say that EVERYONE has to pay.  Ladies... just go to the front of the club earlier in the day and try to talk to whomever is at the door.  Ask if there is a way to get in free or get on the list.  If you have on the right amount of mascara and you have a cute smile, I am sure that they will be able to work something out.

I saw the god awful lines people had to subject themselves to, and I probably wouldn't have bothered. But hey, I was lucky to bypass the madness and head straight in.

I guess to tie-in my earlier thoughts on experiences, our party ended up having a stellar time due to quick bottle service (side note: what's up with the table ninjas that appear at your booth when booze is flowing, quickly to disappear when the last drop drips... wtf?), DJ Spider on the decks (an LA native), and beautiful people abound.

My buddy & I were in town for the Tool show over at Planet Hollywood, and afterward he insisted we go to a nightclub. He is much more into ""that life"" than myself, so a night of stuffing face at Boiling Crab and then drinking while playing video poker was not going to cut it. 

I am not a nightclub person. For one thing, I already have a woman. Secondly, I really don't want to put on a collared shirt for anything that isn't a wedding, a funeral, or paying me. Thirdly, I've been to plenty of clubs before and you know who's there? Douchebags. Douchebags and girls who want douchebags to shower them with free drinks and attention. Douchebags with tables. Douchebags in ill-fitting business shirts stained with sweat and scotch. Douchebag hipsters with an abundance of ironic facial hair and enough flannel to knit a shirt for Paul Bunyon AND his ox. 

We arrived via a party van limo - just the two of us, mind you - complete with stripper pole and sound system blaring every homogenized top 20 rap hit that was hot. My friend didn't feel like waiting in the long taxi line at PH, so he hailed this beast for $75 to get us about four city blocks away. 

I should probably mention that he knows we're headed into my own personal kryptonite lair. He bought the $50 tickets to get in, he's buying the beer, he got the cab. I'm acutely aware of the fact he's basically my temporary sugar daddy, but there was no way I was going to actively participate in any of this. 

We arrived to be greeted by a huge line. We waited in that line for 15 minutes before someone explains that we actually need to be in the OTHER huge line. More waiting ensues before, finally, we get inside...

...where things got worse. This is a pool, ostensibly, and the large body of water in the middle required extensive navigation in order to reach the bar on the other side. Sensibly, the DJ booth is located right in front of the pool, so in addition to the crowd trying to reach the bar you've also got everyone that's already drunk standing around and gyrating to some degree. The barrier of the crowd was marshaled by a herd of thick chicks standing in thigh-deep water. Hands were everywhere. It must have taken 15 minutes to cross 15 feet of walkway. And we didn't even get drinks at that bar. We walked over to the OTHER bar in the middle, which is where my friend ordered one $11 Bud Light after the other. $11. For a Bud Light. 

We stood around and talked because I had literally no idea what else to do. The girls who were decent looking already had at least a vulture or two hanging around; those that were part of the D.U.F.F. (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) crew clustered together and partied like they didn't give a shit who was watching. 

After an agonizing number of hours (which was probably more like 90 minutes), Avicii came on to a decent amount of fanfare. This was the entire reason my friend came. This is what he'd been chiding me about for the last week. Apparently, this Avicii guy is huge in the DJ world and Encore pays him some ridiculous figure to stand around playing THIS? I know it's not the most original comparison, but half these ""songs"" sounded like a Transformer taking a shit. And people were eating it up. They were eating up that shit. I felt slightly queasy, though that could have been the pounding my stomach had been taking from drinking all day\/night. 

As I'm waiting in line for the bathroom, a guy with an absurdly large, well-coiffed mustache stands in front of me, holds up his fist, and waits for me to return the bump. He then says, ""I just saw you here looking good and thought you could use some love."" It was, admittedly, kinda thoughtful. 

2:27a.m. My friend assures me we'll leave at 3:00a.m., but first he needs to hit the head. I wait somewhere nearby. Have I mentioned my phone died hours earlier at the concert? I rarely take my eyes away from the bathroom exit. He never leaves. By the time 3:37a.m. rolls around I've scoured the area A LOT, so I just assume he'll show up at the hotel at some point in time and I leave. Since the taxi line was a good 100+ drunks deep, I walk over to Palazzo, where a cabbie picks me up, offers to take me somewhere for a happy ending massage (not from him), and eventually drops me back at the Monte Carlo - where my dumbass buddy is passed out in bed. I pelt him with Cheerios between eating sloppy handfuls before hitting the sack.",15,101,14

My crew of total 4 guys rolled into Vegas for a long weekend of partying, twice a day Friday through Sunday. We visited XS on 2 occasions: once Saturday night with general admission (GA) and Sunday Night Swim with bottle service with a table as base. 
This is my review on the Saturday night GA entrance. Knowing one of the managers there helped us a lot in getting 4 guys into the club without trouble. We ""shook hands,"" skipped the line and jumped into the action immediately. The place was packed wall to wall at 12 AM and more people were standing in line outside, waiting to get in. We made our way to the outside circular bar next to the pool area. We got 8 shots ($15\/each) with a cup of Sprite for $128. We mingled in the crowd where there were no shortage of beautiful ladies, dressed in tight outfits in every body shapes. We met a group of 8 ladies from Seattle area and had quality conversations. The music was thumping the whole time and when the clock struck 2 AM, Avicii took the stage and worked the crowd like no others! He spun for 2 straight hours and got better as the show went on. 
What set XS apart from other night clubs is the pyro flame that set off at the top of the stage throughout the show. You can feel the heat from each flare! It got the crowd pumped up and the energy around grew with each flaming blow! Some people started jumping into the pool despite wearing clothes and dressed! 
After the show, we headed inside and met up with friends of our host. Come to found out, their booth, which seats 6 people comfortably, had a $4,000 minimum spending that night (Saturday night plus top DJ playing). Believe me, every booth\/table were filled in the house. Needless to say, it was a very good night for XS!",1,1,2

Vegas-lag: 
noun. Inability to sleep from late night partying, gambling, stripping fun that persists upon arrival home. 

Vegas-lag is why you my friend are reading this review right now. 
So XS...as mentioned by the previous yelpers some who coincidentally happen to by my friends (although we never crossed paths at XS. Perhaps in the future though) is a place of glamour, luxury, headonism and indulgence. 

This club does not need promoters, it promotes itself. In fact it doesn't have a guestlist. If you don't know the right people, you are faced with a cover and a line that rivals major theme park rides. Try bribing the bouncers, I heard it works.

But as serendipity would have it, a friend had a friend who had a friend that worked there. You know how that goes. We didn't really care as long as we got in without waiting and paying. And that we sure did, but I'm sure you have your connections too.

Walking through the entrance towards the dance floor, the scene is breath-taking. Pink lights, bodies gyrating to the beat, high ceilings, statuesque Go-go's. If the cinematic Hollywood and vibrant Vegas had a love child it would be XS.

There was a good mix of people, but Asians are very well represented. I have a theory about that but let's say everyone looked like a cousin to me. Ask me about it. Beware ladies, there's something about Vegas that brings out the inner douche bag in every man. So prepare for douche bags encroaching like roaches at night to a fallen cheeto. 

The dance floor is fun but packed. Imagine the orgy scene from the MATRIX--sweaty bodies moving in unison. This is XS. 

My preference is the poolside. We met a rapper and his attorney that night that generously shared their table with us...which led to dancing in the shallow edges of the pool, which led my friend jumping in the pool, another losing a shoe...and a douche bag offering to buy me shoes when I told him I was looking for one. This Vegas-lag is making me miss all the fun we had...",8,9,8

We were told to be on 3 promoters lists (because we liked redundancy), when we got to the ""guest list"" line, the men were told to separate from the women (what are we, Jews in Stasi Germany?) and the women were quickly ushered to a women only line and the men were pointed around to an entrance ladened with heavy set bouncers. In which, quickly we were told that we're ""not on anything"" and will need to pay for either $25 to stand outside in the ridiculous cold (it was 50 degrees and 15mph winds that night), or we can pay $60 to wait 2 hours to go ""inside"" which wasn't very ""inside"" but rather over-cramped people in a very small space. We opted to just stay outside and attempt to dance our asses off to stay warm, which worked to a certain extent. Until a bunch of guys invited us to their table, they promptly offered all our girls molly and cocaine while trying to strong-arm the guys away from the table area. None of our girls took their drinks or drugs, it's now towards the end of the night and the girls wanted to go ""inside"" to take a quick look, they went inside and said ""not worth it"". We quickly gathered our group and headed out, screw this place. This place is perfect for 3 types of people, creepy rich old guys trying to get with dumb sluts, dumb sluts, and celebs. Unless your rich, celebrity status, or a hot girl trying to put out for drinks\/drugs, XS is probably just going to be a bucket list thing for you.",1,1,0

Granted, we rented a table, and at a cost of $500 on a Friday night. Well, you're required to purchase $500 of alcohol, but that's easy to do when a bottle of wine is $450. (Current cost is $500 for less than 6 people; 6 people or more is $1,000.)

If you're looking for great service, then renting a table is the way to go. We were seated out by the pool area, which was the best location since we were out of the way of the masses of people on the dance floor but could still participate when we wanted. We never had to get up for drinks as they were brought to us by our server, someone else cleared our empty glasses, and the bouncers\/security were always within arm's reach asking us if we were comfortable or needed anything. I did not find the bouncers to be rude at all; in fact, we felt very secure having them there.

I also agree that you should get in line early; they started letting people in at 10 pm. If you have the money to spare, renting a table makes for the ultimate experience.",4,0,0

The first time I would have rated it a 4 because it was beautiful, had great music, but the crowd wasn't that fun or energetic. We didn't dance inside because it was too overcrowded so we danced in\/by the pool. It was a Saturday night in July with a group of 5 girls and didn't go near the black jack\/craps tables.

The second time I came here was the best time I've ever had in a Vegas club! I came here with a coed group of 7 on a Saturday night in August. We went back and forth between the black jack tables, craps tables, and indoor dance area. The black jack table started off at a $25 min and by the end of the night it was a $100 min....it didn't really matter because my date was acting like it was a $500 min lol. There was a lot of energy by the tables (mainly ours). My date was high-fiving complete strangers and everyone around us was yelling in excitement...it was crazy!

even the bathroom attendants where on point. lint rollers while you wash your hands. towels on time. shoooot i feel like they should hold my thang thang while i pee so i dont even have to wash my hands but thats a little out there ehh?

But if you don't come here early, the line can get superrrrr long! There's not really a guestlist so cover for girls is $20 and guys is $30. This may be the one club in Vegas where girls actually have to pay to get in, but it's SO worth it! I went on a Saturday night and it was seriously crowded. It was so hard to move through the crowd, especially on the dance floor. Music was awesome though! It was SO loud near the front that I thought the bass would make the heart jump out of my chest! And every once in a while, money would fall from the ceiling and the crowd would just go wildddd! It was all $1 bills though but it's all good. My friend managed to collect 20 of them so she pretty much made up for the club cover charge right there! haha!

The outdoor area was really nice, definitely not as loud so you can actually carry a conversation. Plenty of places to sit which was nice, and there were quite a few people dancing with their shoes off in the super shallow area of the pool. You can dance AND let the cool water soothe your sore feet and and ankles at the same time. :)

Bar service was really amazing despite the crowdedness! 

And to top it all off, I saw Paris Hilton and John Mayer there too!! AHHH! :D I was sooo close to them!!

When XS first opened up, it was the perfect blend of class and fun.  You could always escape the shoulder to shoulder madness if you didn't want to stay on the sweaty dance floor or deal with the runway chaos of the indoor tables that surrounds the DJ stage.  All you had to do is walk to the outside part of the club and you could have instant claustrophobia relief and get your personal space back!  

In today's XS experience, good luck trying to escape.  The entire club is so busy that truly the only relief you can get is IF you can get a table that has decent enough room for you to breathe.  The table also helps to alleviate any stress and frustrations on trying to get a drink at the bar.  The lines at ALL of the bars can be shoulder to shoulder long and about 10-15 people back.  Good luck ordering a round of drinks...if and when you do, you'll want to keep that round just to yourself so you don't have to go through that experience again.  

So I gave XS 4 stars because I am truly a fan of the design of the club and talent that they bring on stage. I was able to realize this after having a pleasant experience of getting a table on stage next to the DJ.  On the other hand, if you don't get a table, I would suggest either going somewhere else.  Personally, if I was going there without the comfort of a table, I will not go there. Period.  I want to save my sanity.",1,0,0

That's what I kept saying all night.

First I saw the line and said ""Wow"".  Thank god for advanced ticket sales and not having to wait in the line since we were staying at the Encore.  We went right in.

I then stepped in this place and there was so many freaking hotties in there.  (""Wow"" I said to myself).  We squeezed our way to the bar and waited and waited to get served and the bartender was incredibly rude.  ""Wow, what a bitch!"" I thought.  Another ""wow"" came out of my mouth when I saw the cost of the drink.  

As we made it to the dance floor, I noticed two Go-Go dancers on the podium and waaaaay out in the horizon was another stage that looked like was separated by a big pool.  Oh man, how the heck are we going to make it thru that sea of crazy dancing partyers?  It was virtually impossible to squeeze thru without getting an elbow, head, bushel of hair, splash of vodka, or smear of body glitter on you while  trying to get to the outside.  WOW!  This place is huge!

We asked the bartender manning the outside bar for some water.  Her response was ""sorry, I can't give you water"".  I was like WTF?  Are you serious?  Then for some reason, she grabs a glass and fills it with ice and puts it in front of me.  Ok....

I then said ""Alright.  Can I BUY a bottle of water?"" She then grabs another glass, fills it with water and sets it in front of me.  (Are you fucking kidding me bitch?)  I reiterated to her that I wanted to BUY a bottle of water.  Comprende ingles bedeja?  Now she grabs a bottle of Fiji water and says $8.  WOW.  $8 for a non-alcoholic drink?  Water is the cheapest substance on earth!  How the fuck can you get away with charging $8 for water?  Oh well, I paid it.  I wasn't about to get in it with her or any other bitchy bartender.  

The rest of the night was cool.  We managed to grab a bed out by the pool and kick it while gazing up at the full moon, palm trees, admiring the Wynn and Encore hotels, the music, and people watching.  The club is huge, spectacular, glamourous, and full of hot chicks.  Guys are a different story....Wow I think I was the hottest dude there!  Kidding!",3,7,3

On any given weekend, there's a great mixed crowd and always fun people to meet. Occasionally, they'll offer a night time pool party, where you can get into the pool or hot tubs at night, super cool!

There are two layouts: outside surrounding the pool and inside which is circular surrounding the DJ stage. XS is home to many famous DJ residences and you can always expect a busy night when they're open.

The club itself is nice. great layout. absolutely love that.
Outdoor by the pool. plenty of places to sit for your sore feet.

With a ridiculous amount of clubs and bars to choose from in Las Vegas, this one will keep me coming back. I have nothing bad to say about it. 

Having said that... It can be challenging to get inside. If there is a big name DJ playing (which is most weekend nights, Fri-Sun evening) I would HIGHLY recommend getting advance tickets. If you are a group of all guys, bottle service is probably going to be your best bet. The lines can get really really crazy... and waiting outside for hours is just not fun. If you are a group of girls, you can get in free and pretty easy with some of the promoters (and even score free drink tickets), and a mixed even ratio group can usually get in pretty easy as well (I would just get there early!).

Inside the setup is really nice. Decent sized dance floors, VIP tables are in good locations, and the outside of XS is really amazing. There are VIP tables all around the pool, in the middle of the pool is another bar and some gambling tables, and just plenty of room to hangout, dance, listen to the music without being in the packed club. 

The crowd is really mixed, a nice blend of mid 20s somethings to early 40s I would say. Everyone is dressed well and having a good time.

Outside the music was pumping and it was pretty warm. Getting inside is tricky business though it seems. We managed to finagle our way in and the raging ensued. The VIP tables surrounding the dancefloor were inhabited by the likes of Russell Westbrook and other celebs. 

The bars are pretty crowded, mostly with guys trying to buy girls shots. Flash a big bill if you want some attention here. The bathrooms were clean and well attended. 

Great music system inside and out. Loved the random showers of money and streamers. Though the confetti and streamers start to make a huge and dangerous pile on the floor. I saw at least 3 girls crash and burn walking through the pile. Clean up on aisle 5?!

Let me tell you though, the cover charge always varies. On a non holiday weekend I paid $20, on guest-list. Last President's day weekend, it was doubled, no guest lists and dudes paid $100. 

The drinks aren't that overly charged (it is Vegas) and the bartenders are always so accommodating. I've never been a served a weak drink or given a shotty attitude.

Came here to see Nervo and had my doubts. In the end, I was blown away. First off, compared to the other clubs, XS has the most room to shake it. There's more room for you to actually be in the front to see whatever DJ you want to see. 

The downfall of clubbing at XS in the winter? The crowd. Because it's pretty popular, you have a ton of people coming in. Of those people who come in, you have a certain percentage of idiots. I have seen more fights than I should have in one night. One fight, this guy came out of nowhere, jumped a guy right next to me, and pounded his face to the floor for a good minute or so. Not even one security guard came... And me? I almost got into a fight there for having to deal with a rambunctious idiot. 

XS has a great atmosphere and goes down as one of the best clubs in Vegas. Drinks will set you back around $17 but the quality of their drinks here compared to Surrender is 10 times better.

If you're trying to decide between Surrender or XS, I will guarantee you will have a better time at XS. My experiences with Surrender have always been terrible. But at XS, the bouncers and staff members are nicer.

Did you know you can dance in the pool?? So awesome.

Unlike a lot of other party spots in LV, security inside isn't too strict about groups of drunkies raiding empty tables and beds. There's so many VIP areas available, you won't have someone breathing down your neck if you want to steal one to rest your feet for a few minutes. 

However, I can't say the same thing about the bouncers in front managing the line.

They've gotten a bit more organized about their lines now (THANK GOODNESS), but the guys that work them are still pricks that want ridiculous tips for a favor. With that being said, I've learned a trick that I think everyone should take into consideration:

- Get in line by 9:30 (make sure you scout for passes beforehand if you're a lady)
- Get stamped by 10.
- Go back up to your room for drinks.
- Come back down at midnight and pass up the fat line that wraps around to the Wynn Theater.

Why does this work? - You'll only need to wait about 20-30 minutes rather than over an hour, you'll get a good buzz without having to drop bills at the bar, you'll get to feel like VIP walking past everyone else standing in line when you return, and the music doesn't really get goin' until after 12am anyway.

Big ups to my promoter Kenny Tran (714-883-5831) for getting my friend and me on the guest list for XS. He answered my text right away and gave me great instructions on how to get in, and even a heads up to go early. Oh Kenny. Your advice was spot on. We saw people getting in the guest list line who were told the wait was an hour around 11PM. Hope you didn't wear heels, girl.

We went for Nightswim with KYGO headlining (he came on around 1:30AM). It was amazingly fun. On these nights, don't worry about wearing heels and cute chokers and a nicer romper like I did. You can get away with wearing a bathing suit and flip flops because if you're like me, you'll discover dance parties are way more fun in the pool. 

It didn't matter what you looked like, how you danced, how many $15 drinks you bought, or what section of that insane venue you were partying in.

You feel like a bunch of sardines parked into a too tight can. No space to move around..literally. Instead of dancing you're more so just waddling around. 

The outdoor area surrounding the pool is perfect for summer nights. Spacious and amble sitting space for your poor tired feet.

My only gripe about XS is how they handle large crowds. Once they've reached their capacity limit, they refuse to let people go and in between the indoor and outdoor area. On crazy nights, such as the night Calvin Harris was there, once you're outside, you're stuck outside.

The good thing though, during summer nights, the outside pool\/cabana area is perfect for dipping your feet in the pool and just to lounge around talking to your friends or random strangers.

I went two weeks ago when Calvin Harris was the guest..and that night was scorching hot. Thank god I was outside, right behind the DJ stage. It was perfect. Even though you were outside by the pool, there was a big screen that showed everything happening inside. The best part of the night? Everyone started dancing and straight up jumping into the pool. It was awesome... So for that reason, I'll give XS another star.",4,1,3

Is me standing here a fire violation, really? 

Once you get through the maze and the $20 cover charge, you enter the quintessential world of VEGAS. Gold boobs, table service, stripper poles, and various dance floors. It's LUSH, ELEGANT, and NOT tacky. I swear all that was missing was some candy walls and glitter from the ceiling at 1AM.  It works. It's not stuffy, and the people are a good mix of dorks, rappers, and true beat thumping dancers. 

You will have eye candy and those people that just make you want to look away...yes drunk girl in the bathroom who is naked, I am talking about you.  Nonetheless, this is one of my favorite clubs in Vegas.  It's entertaining and busy in a good way.  Not to be missed! 

Did I mention the club is SPACIOUS.   Multiple open dance areas with plenty of ventilation make the night crawlers stay out past their bed times.    In addition, there is an outdoor area to mingle. It boasts a relaxing pool, cabanas, game tables, and for the sexy-heaters.

 The pool is a nice touch.  If your feet start to ache, take a quick dip outside and JUST DANCE. 

If you are walking to XS, pack some socks...the walk home at 5AM is going to be painful.  Tip: Get a cab!",7,7,7

What i hated about this place was how the workers in front act. I had paid for skip the line passes, and backed that up by signing up for the guest list. Apparently they didn't update their list and didn't have my name on there or god knows what they did. Anyways the extra money i paid WASTED - NOT COOL because it wasn't cheap. So a worker wrote me up some paper, and i had to wait on line. Let me add that this same little paper i had, i still saw people skipping through the line with. She then said there was a way for me to get in - which was slip her some money. Maybe if i hadn't paid that extra damn money, i would have...but at that point i was pretty irritated and decided to wait. An hour later i was talking to a bouncer  about the other line workers or whatever you call them and he did confess to me that they do take money to let people in, or it is just who you know and he said yes, it is unfair and does suck. I guess i shouldn't have been surprised with the club workers acting this way...it a Vegas club.

After about 2 hours plus of waiting. I was in and just in time because Deadmau5 was there and he had just came on. He is freakin AWESOME! XS itself is a pretty nice looking place. It was holy freakin crowded on the inside, but that was expected. When i needed a breather i just went outside, and then when i was ready to face the pushing and slow moving traffic, i went back inside. I mean, everyone wanted to see Deadmau5, can't blame them! 

Anyways, aside from the screwy treatment on line, i did enjoy myself a lot here. Good music (Deadmau5! whoohoo!), nice surroundings. I just hope i gave a heads up about how you MIGHT get treated while you are on line.",1,0,1

I honestly don't know why this is the ""top club"" in Vegas because it is seriously the most OVERRATED club I've ever been to. I've failed to see any distinction of this club's that makes it the ""best."" Long lines, mean bouncers, and crowded. I've given XS at least 4 chances, hoping to finally enjoy it more than the previous time because of the hype and still, always just thinking...MEH (and going away a bit poorer). At least other clubs offer open bar to girls.  (Have I mentioned OVERRATED yet??) The employees here are some of the meanest I've ever met too. 

First sign was right when we got to the area by XS and some rude (and ghetto) woman working for Encore yelled at us to ""MOVE IT!"" when we were just trying to meet friends and figure out where to go. We weren't loitering in the walk area, didn't even stop for more than 20 seconds, and were just walking around trying to find other people. She also had the meanest looking face and eyes I've EVER seen in a hotel employee. Isn't this still hospitality? I was just so shocked that I didn't know what to say. How can a hotel hire someone like that?

Also, I can't exactly pinpoint what but I can never dance for long here either. I think it's because the dance floor itself is wayyy too small for such a popular club so it's always crowded and you have no space to get your groove on!

FYI, XS is a major magnet for the creeps. In my opinion, other clubs such as Marquee have more people who are just there to enjoy the music and have a good time with friends whereas XS is THE destination to go to for creeps who wanna get into someone's pants. My group of girl friends felt like they were being attacked and were just a bunch of meat! Where you classy fellows at who know how to treat ladies properly?! Sure not at XS.....

Between the bottle minimum and tip, we spent over $2600 (which doesn't include what we also spent at the blackjack tables). We have done table service at many similar Vegas clubs over the years, so this was not a new experience for us in general, but it was our first time at XS specifically.

CONS
--We arrived at 10 pm, and despite having a reservation, still had to stand in line for 20 minutes. And I didn't have a single memorable encounter with a host - generally they were pretty unfriendly.
--While it was a nice evening to be outdoors, our poolside table was almost as far from the stage and dance floor as one can get.
--The dance floor required some other form of access which apparently our $2600 did not buy us immediate access to. However, our server told us if we wanted to hit the dance floor, we could text our host (even though we had yet to see him at any point during the evening) or we could flag her down and she would get him for us. Which leads to my next point...
--Our server was very friendly and I have no complaints about her personally. However, she was clearly over-assigned or otherwise occupied because we were lucky to see her every 45 minutes. She apologized each time, but it still doesn't excuse the fact that we were paying as much as we were to barely see our server throughout the night (fortunately none of us wanted that dance floor access too badly).
--By midnight, our table area was completely surrounded by people who had paid the minimum cover for access to the club, and they were spilling over into our space.

PROS
--Blackjack tables were good.
--The weather was nice so it was a good night for a poolside table.
--The music was good.
--Our group of friends has fun no matter where we go, and thanks to 3 bottles of alcohol, we made the most of it.

This club is clearly trying to be everything to everyone - exclusive table service + large dance club. Unfortunately it's not working.",1,0,0

Last time we were here it was EDC weekend Sunday, and it was a pool party! Too bad I didn't know and was all dolled up for clubbing. We were all pretty bummed. Some of my friends had a table right by the pool and they were all swimming and playing. *so jealous* 
They did provide glasses now with bottle service, but if you wear fake eyelashes to go clubbing, you will want to pop the lenses out. My lashes kept brushing against it! But some guys popped it out for us and then we were rocking them! I like the Party Rock glasses at Marquee better. I guess this is the new trend LOL.

we didn't really party here, it was relatively quieter Sunday evening - even that being it was Superbowl weekend. The venue is BEAUTIFUL and breathtaking... walk down the stairs, you see very trendy night club seating and tables, with stripper poles that adorn most of the seating. in the background beyond the dance floor, you see the lighted gazebo-like structure that is the outside pool bar... the light and the setting takes you out of Vegas and places you at a Monte Carlos like resort south of France (at least, what I would imagine for it)

they had go go dancers on the sides of the dancefloor on a small stage, and also one on top of the pool side circular bar... the pool side has plenty of seating like comfortable couches, and even big billowy beds for getting comfy. candlelight adorn this place, the cabanas turn into table service. 

i can imagine having a rocking party here, especially if the weather was warmer.

The group seems dressier or classier than that of Tao - the age range is bigger here, some of the older crowd also come to this place. This is Vegas in its finest feathers.

I didn't have anything to drink, but i'd imagine it would be similar to the drinks by the poolside we had earlier since the same bar also serves the XS night club at night.

Perfect venue - fun for a big group - and romantic with your sweet baboo.

What made XS is the indoor outdoor feature.  It is just stunning with the shimmering Wynn and Encore towers, and the beautiful pool and ""garden"" areas. Warm nights, beautiful sky, excellent sound system, etc. The gambling poolside was also such a nice touch.

I'll say it here, this is the NICEST club I've ever been to and the clubgoers at this place for the most part are cool people, but it just didn't feel very high class to me.  That's something tough to expect, but considering all the hype this venue gets, that's what I was looking for.

Highlights at this club include the stripper poles... I mean if you have a bunch of lady friends, seeing them fail at pole dancing is pretty hilarious.  They also feature the best house DJs a lot more than any other club, so if you're into that vibe it works.  There's also confetti and stuff when things get really crackin'.

There's also a pool outside.  People aren't allowed to mess with it at night, but it really gives the club a serene feel.

As far as why I don't like the place as much as others... one, I'm a guy.  So yeah, it's gonna suck being that guy who insists on buying alcohol for everybody... and then seeing your tab run up to $500 due to simpleass cocktails running you $50 a glass.

Don't even get me started on the fact that they don't bottle their beer.

Two, again, I'm a guy... and I like to think I'm well-dressed.  It's discouraging as hell to have bouncers watch your every move when you're dressed like a million bucks, yet they won't pay any mind to hypebeasts who show up wearing some fakeass flannel from Tillys.  There was this one super chinky and scrawny dude in plaid (seriously? plaid at an upscale club?) and he was hella hitting it off with the ladies, and I honestly couldn't believe what I was seeing.  That killed my buzz.

Of course, all that aside, the club is still very enjoyable.  Annoying, but it's deserving of being a Top 3 Vegas Hot Spot.  Best way to maximize the fun is to get bottle service.  You truly get the VIP experience, the seats are comfortable, and you get a good view of pretty much everything.

VIP service here will cost an ARM and LEG though.  If you have a hook, like a promoter or Vegas event planner, definitely take advantage of his services, especially if you're in a group.",3,1,0

Cover: Yes, there is a fat cover, $50 or so if you ain't connected.  Even if you are, you'll pay a little some some.  If you're a celebrity, you probably get paid to go, so I guess it all works out.

Going to a place like this makes you want to open a club because you want to charge $50 for desperate folks trying to get in, which is genius.  3 Bottles + cover for a bunch of guys total something like $2300.  I could retire fat and watch all these $ signs from my XS Skybox.

This place is PERFECT for all the guy wallflowers. Why?

You have the inside which is for all the dancers, and you have the outside for those who just want to chill out and have a drink without feeling the pressure to dance and feel left out.

In addition, for those people who want to gamble, you can go to the back, which is HUGE and gamble your weekly paycheck away @ the $50 minimum tables, blackjack bro.

Its one of the more pricier clubs but hey its vegas! Its totally worth it.",1,1,1

i actually had no previous impression of what this place would be like because i didn't know anyone who went yet and it was also a last minute decision to go... but boy, i'm sure glad i got to go even though we got there pretty late. i was able to get in for free but usually it's $20 for girls and $30 for guys.

yes, the drinks are extremely pricy but that's understandable cause it's vegas. but be careful when you order water because they charge $8 for bottled water! i think the bartender thought she could trick me by giving me fiji water but i totally gave it back to her and said ""can i have tap water?"" and that was free :D as for the drinks, i got a shot of patron which was $12 and an AMF which was $16. eek. the shot did come with a chaser though, so i guess that's a little nicer. 

the decor was absolutely beautiful!! they have a hugeee chandelier right above the dance floor and the dance floor itself is huge. the thing i like best is how it's extremely well ventilated because it's half outdoors. you could dance all night and not be all sweaty. haha i also really enjoyed their music! their bathrooms are nice too. it was just overall a very fun experience. i can't wait to go back!",2,2,1

BOTTLE SERVICE:
We were there this past Saturday celebrating a couple of birthdays and had booked a table for bottle service through one of the promoters.  Prices for bottles start at $450 (for rum); starting prices for vodka is $460 (for Absolut).  We were a group of nine ladies and our minimum was three bottles (one bottle for every three).  Factor in tax\/gratuity and our bill came to $1,800 (or less, if you're going to be cheap on gratuity).  Don't know if bottle prices are lower on less busy nights.  

WARNING ABOUT BOTTLE SERVICE SEATING:
Ok, so we were led by our host to a tiny table and were told this is our spot for the night for our group of nine.  We were sandwiched in between two other tables.  Since the tables to the right and left of us were already occupied, there were only enough ""seats"" left to fit four of us.  So, I refused to sit and asked the host to find us another spot as I am paying for three bottles.  I felt that I should be accommodated for our group of nine.  

We were told that it was a very busy night and they are filled to capacity.  He tried to get us relocated to a cabana (outside) but was told none was available.  After standing around for a good 20 mins trying to work something out, he said that if we accept the table, he will come and find us later on to relocate us if a larger table opens up.  This was a load of BS I think, but we got tired of arguing and decided to stay, since we wanted to get our party on.   

Soon after, the table to our left cleared out, so we took over their seats...providing a chance for my whole group to sit and drink.  An hour later, another party showed up and took that table, but we got lucky again as the party to our right was leaving.  Had both parties stayed, our tiny little area would not have been able to accommodate our group.  This was the only negative aspect out of the whole night.  

I felt that XS misrepresented bottle service seating.  The promoter surprised me with a beautiful (and complimentary) birthday cake later on...so that kind of made me forgive the little snafu.  Well, that and the mixed drinks helped to mellow out my mood.  BTW, there was a stripper pole right in front of our table, so my friends were able to take advantage of that and showcase their inner stripper.  

If you experience the same runaround we did, just be firm, polite, but STAND YOUR GROUND.  ;-P  

PROS:
- Beautiful and spacious club
- Diverse and good-looking crowd
- Great music (mash-up, top 40s, house, hip hop)
- Lines for bathroom not as bad as other clubs
- Professional, friendly, and good-looking staff
- Plenty of stripper poles located throughout the club
- For those that opt out of bottle service, you can sit at any table as long as the party hasn't arrived to claim their reserved table; if they never come, you can sit there pretty much all night

CONS:
- Bottle service seating experience
- Our waitress only came by the table 3-4 times the whole time we were there 
- Lines for general admission, guestlist and table reservations are VERY unorganized.  We had bottle service and pretty much had to battle our way to the front of our line to get a host's attention.  Look your best as they will pick and choose who to address based on your looks (which is the case at most clubs in Vegas).

Also, super inconvenient if you purchase will call tickets because you have to pick up your tickets first from a separate location.

GOOD: Only positive side with XS is they are good about letting people in with presales. Totally separate line and it didn't matter if you were a guy with no girls as long as you had a presale. Walked straight on there.

BAD:No crowd control of dancefloor. They don't block off entrance to the dancefloor like at Marquee, so you are in a sardine can if you want to dance.

Security are total dicks. My friends and I met some guys at a table and we hung out with them for most of the night.

The decor is FABulous! The place is huge, and no matter where you are, be it inside on the dance floor, at a booth, by the pool, laying on one of the beds, or in the bathroom this club is sure to impress you. 

The staff is great. We did not have any problem getting drinks at the bars. They have several throughout. Inside, and outside. Of course they were like a bajillion dollars each, but what do you expect from a club in Vegas?? 

The cover I think is $30 for guys and $20 for girls. My girlfriends and I did not have to pay a cover. Just look around, and talk to people. And clubs are always trying to get lots of girls in their venues, so I suggest looking for a promoter especially if you're just in a group of girls. 

I def. recommend this place to one and all! Def. something you need to experience for yourself.  I will def. be coming back here next time I'm in town.

My first visit to XS was back around 2008 (give or take a year). Was there on a Monday for industry night. GA entry was free for locals. Very little line out front. Afrojack was starting to become known in town and was the main talent. The dance floor was crowded but not Marquee or Hakkasan level of squish. Back then the outdoor portion was no open on such a night and everything was contained in the main room. There was no elaborate stage setup...just the dj platform and a large LED screen along the front.

Fast forward to my most recent visit in the spring of 2015 on a Saturday night for headliner Kaskade. The inside is off limits to anyone except those who paid general admission. We were on guestlist so we were kept outside. If you are on guest list your line is on the complete opposite side of the casino in an empty ballroom. Many switchbacks, reminiscent of Disneyland or Six Flags. Once ""inside"" the pool area, the vibe is much more backyard party versus nightclub. The added lights strung across the area were nice as were the additional LED screens. I also like the ability to go upstairs and take it all in from the second floor of cabanas.

While I appreciate the open area and relaxing vibe of the pool, I really miss the energy of being up in the main room...especially with all the added production they put in at the start of this year. For me, when I go to a club, I want to rage. Obviously there is no way they could ever fit all those people in the main room and applaud the attempt at crowd control, but for me XS lost some energy because of it. The sound is just not loud enough unless you are up on the sliver of solid ground that sits between the DJ platform and the pool. You get no confetti, very little cryo and not the feeling of being ""in it.""

Guess I need to make rich friends before I attempt another visit so I can get back inside or go during one of the Nightswim events when the focus is more outside.",0,0,0

So that should tell you how impressive I found XS.  First off entering the club, as soon as we entered Encore from the parking garage we were greeted by a huge line that only seemed to go through the entire shopping area.  Luckily one of the girls in the group knew somebody who knew somebody who . . . well you know how it works in Vegas.  So no long excruciating wait and no cover charge so that will probably change your experience.

Once we walked in into the main room I immediately noticed the one big negative I have regarding this place.  That smell!  One of my friends described it best as either stale liquor, a massive gathering of b.o. or both combined.  Hopefully that's not something that's always there and it people were just extra sweaty from the heat outside.  Luckily once you walked away from the main entrance the stench wavered and was gone by the time you were outside.  

Inside there really isn't anywhere to sit as of course it was a Saturday night and the place was full.  This includes that rather small dance floor where you feel like a pack of sardines whenever the DJ plays something everyone loves.  Eventually though you're able to get enough space for your group to move in rhythm a bit.

Luckily though, this was back when it was still warm outside and the all of the outside part of the club was accessible.  This is what makes the place work for me.  Outside there were plenty of places to relax, sit, talk and still get your drinks with a beautiful scenery.  Expect it to be pricey, one round of drinks for 6 people were usually in the 70 to 100 dollars range before you throw in tip.  Our group was able to dance on the floor, come back out, relax, get a drink, go back to the dance floor, rinse and repeat.  It's as if all my issues with nightclubs never existed well except for the cost of drinks but what can you do, most of the group was from out of town you can't look cheap!

Of course all the people in the club well-dressed (IE scantily clad) and beautiful thanks to a strict dress code.  Although I still wonder how a scruffy looking old man with a shirt that said ""fuck you"" (pardon my French) was allowed in the club.  He was probably a millionaire as he was also at Drai's later that night.  

Of course this rating belongs as much to the fun group of people I spent the night with as much as the club but XS certainly didn't do anything to detract from the experience and with their outside part of the club it only enhanced it.  Next time I come back to a nightclub in two years (by my estimation anyway), this will be the first spot I hit.  Making it rain y'all!",3,2,1

The club is beautiful, depending on who's DJING obviously will reflect the dynamic and vibe of the club. Drink tickets usually given to girls. Fun club, good service all in all... But here's the most important part. 

SKILLED PICK POCKETERS COME HERE. - watch your phones and wallets, even if they are in your purse. There tends to be these random waves of over-crowding, then all of sudden everyone is missing their personal belongings. Each and every time I've been here someone from my group has been robbed conveniently after this crowd surfing event. I hear that this has happened to many people here, particularly at XS. When you go to LVPD most of the people making a report are complaining that the theft happened at XS.

I've gone through a front entrance & a back entrance during the times I've been here. If anything, go to the front entrance. I'm not really sure what the back entrance is all about. I only ended up there because the limo dropped us off closer to that entrance...which kinda messed us up later when we were going inside.

This club is sooo GORGEOUS! :) It's definitely one of the clubs where you wear your ""best outfit."" Dress to impress! As you walk in & reach the top of the stairs, your eyes get bigger at such a pretty sight (unless you're already super drunk, then you see the blurred 'XS' sign shining at you, haha!). 

Music NEVER fails me here! Definitely keeps me on the dance floor..unless my heels have gotten the best of me, haha! ;P

Winter time. They close off the outside :( But the club is still really good! It's still spacious enough. Dance floor gets crowded, but that's a good thing (for the most part).

Summer time. It's fair game! Haha. LOVE LOVE LOVE the outside area of XS. It's hugeee. & people are just having a great time...everywhere! The daybeds & pool are a GREAT PLUS. If XS is a definite must in the winter time, it's an ABSOLUTE\/DEFINITE MUST in the summer time!!

$35 to get in for guys, $25 for girls...ehhh.....Vegas.....

This club is large inside and had a great DJ spinning. But the best part of this place is the outdoors. We came here on a Sunday night and they were having a pool party. So there was a DJ inside spinning great tunes but the real party was outside, in and around the pool. Another DJ was out there, again, great dance music and people dancing in the pool. We got there at 2 am and the party was in full swing. No one was planning on leaving. Ended up staying until about 4 or 5, got our groove on and had a lot of fun. 

Drinks are typical Vegas prices but it's Vegas, you didn't come here to save money.

In the span of 30 minutes, I had seen about a thousand people, among them, a girl dancing near an older (like 60s) Middle Eastern man dropping it like it's hot with a glass full of beer on his head, people dancing around in the pool like the beginning of FRIENDS, and a girl having a 'dance off' with the go-go dancer at the gambling island in the middle of the club. Oh, by the way, that ""girl""? It was me.

Get past the $20 dollar cover for girls and $30 for guys (the line goes quickly because they let every Tom, Dick and Harry in) and your initial desire to throw up when you walk in. If you don't get a table, get a drink IMMEDIATELY and then get outside to enjoy the fresh air and total ridiculousness that is XS.

We didn't get there until like 2AM - having just come from one of the WORST clubs in Vegas (The Bank) - and we stayed until 5AM. The best part about this club is that it really lives up to its name. Did I really need to spend my cash at the $50 minimum blackjack table (the cheapest table)? Of course not. I usually come back from Vegas up from careful blackjack playing, but all that went right down the tube at XS, and I'm okay with that.

You should really have at least three drinks before you come to this place, because I don't recommend it sober. This is one of the only clubs that I have been where I was fine to not have a table. Dress to the nines, wear your next to most uncomfortable pair of smoking hot heels, and be prepared for the ultimate Vegas experience.",2,4,2

We bought some drinks and decided to pay cover to go inside, because most of the outside space is taken up by the pool, blackjack tables and VIP couches, and you can't see the DJ from outside. It was also a cold night, and almost all of the heat lamps are next to VIP couches.

Unfortunately, everyone else had the same idea. The inside was literally rammed full of people. The dancefloor had filled up early and was closed for the rest of the night. Moving from one side of the room to the other took 10 minutes of pushing and shoving. I've been to busy clubs before, and a crowd is usually a good thing, but XS was clearly WAY over capacity and probably in violation of fire code. It was equal parts ridiculous and dangerous. To top it off, when we left they were still letting people in and charging $100 cover for guys.

At that point, don't even bother trying to get in unless you have the hookups or you're coming with supermodels.  Also, they told me two hours before it opened that it was $30 for entry but when I got there that night they charged $50.  I was really pissed at first but by the end of the night I felt it was completely worth it.

This place is just ridiculous.  The outdoor pool area is huge and you can actually put your feet in if you want to sit and cool down.  There are also random jacuzzis around as well if you want to stay warm.  If you walk past the pool, there's a gazebo where you can gamble as well if you're tired of the clubbing scene.  There are just so many things here that look amazing it would take me two hours to write about all of it.  I hate using cliches but it literally looks like a movie set.  

One bad thing about XS is that the bars are ALWAYS jam packed.  It seriously takes you 20 minutes to get a drink.  My advice is to befriend the people who get bottle service and get some alcohol from them.  Bring some random girls for them and you're in for sure.  

This leads me to my next topic which is girls.  There are so many gorgeous girls here it's ridiculous.  I used to be very active in LA nightlife and even then, I have never seen anything close to this many hot girls in one venue.  

What made my night was that everyone here was so cool (probably because they're in Vegas).  Even when some Australian guy caught me stealing vodka from his table, he got mad for 2 seconds and then just laughed it off and said ""It's ok mate!""  as I continue downing his drinks.

We got there at 10:30 and the line was already wrapped around past the theater entrance (almost 100 yards). Our host walked us to the front of the line and in we went. 
The energy all night was great and we strolled around the pool a couple of times at it was a great vibe outside too. Always fun to see women in and out of their heels dancing or just cooling off in the wading part of the pool.

Me, my wifey, and a whole bunch of friends went here last Saturday night.  We got there about 10pm and waited only about 20 mins to get in... YES!

The DJ that night was playing some okay dance tracks but I swear he had waaaay too many pauses with some songs that the crowd stopped dancing til the beat picked up again... like what the heck are you doing? It's supposed flow! Whatever, I was having fun.

I definitely had more fun last time I went... maybe because last time it was my bachelor's party... could be... but one thing I noticed was that this club got Asianed out real quick!

I reviewed this place thoroughly before I even set foot in it. People were impressed by the ambiance, the size, and the music. I decided to give this place my own spin, and can I just say that XS takes the cake in the coveted ""Best of the Best"" section.

My crew and I rolled up at around 1 in the morning, two girls and two guys. We knew our chances of getting in were slim to none, mostly because if you roll with 50\/50 guy\/girl ratio or higher, you're fucked. Regardless, we threw caution to the wind and stepped up to the place. 

Here be the deets:

1) The line: What line? The doormen were gracious, quick, and thorough, checking the hell out of my ID and moving in along. The place was packed, you could tell, but they kept letting people in regardless. A few people asked us if we were on the list, and I remember telling myself, ""My God, how refreshing to finally be in a place where the honor the coveted list!"" Even at 1 in the morning we moved through the line at a brisk pace, getting in after a mere 15 minutes.

Cover: EVERYBODY pays. A LOT. I'm warning you beforehand, if you're coming strapped for cash, you'd better step aside for those who come packing heat. The girls paid 20, guys 50. 50?! I know, I know... it's a ridiculous amount. Ludicrous, even. BUT... we got through the line quickly, paid our money, and were not discriminated against just because we had a large group of guys. So, it was worth it, now that I think about it.

Ambiance: Jesus, Jesus, Jesus! I see now that it stays true to its moniker of ""Most Expensive Club in  the World."" There are robed people coming out of gold walls, a gorgeous staircase, naked women whose titties follow you around plastered on the bar wall, a beautiful, huge, rotating chandelier suspended above a huge dancefloor, stripper poles, a pool... There's so much to see that it's crazy. Everything is rich, gaudy, drenched in gold and gems--too much done just right. The setting alone puts on a show, and I thoroughly regret not springing for bottle service, not gonna lie. I agree with many of my fellow Yelpers when they say it looks like a much larger Tryst. 

Drinks: This is why this place gets 4 stars and not 5. Typical Vegas prices, typical Vegas drinks--don't expect too much so party up at home and then come out.

Crowd: Best-looking crowd I have ever seen, anywhere. No joke. People make a crazy effort to look good for this place, and I've never seen so much Gucci, Versace, and Cavalli on a young crowd. The guys and dolls are worth the look, I promise you.

Music: The best thing this place offers. Tired of your Top-40, hip-hop re-hash? Do you want a good dose of electro, mash-up, and remixes? Mix it all together and you get XS's nightly musical selection. I danced my ass off for hours while singing along to Lady Gaga, Ciara, Daft Punk, Madonna, Kanye... yup, the list keeps going and going and going...

Also, out of 10 people in our group, two got pick pocketed and we met many poor souls who had their phones taken that night as well. Pretty crappy experience and I am not sure how much they can do to prevent this...more visible security presence? Anyway, just be warned and be aware.

They didn't seem all that surprised with our report of the wallet and when we called the missing claims number they gave us to check in and see if anything was turned in...they wouldn't answer all day.

Plus side, It was great to see Skrillex perform and the bar service was quick and polite. We bought tickets ahead and got there pretty early and had a great line experience but our friend who also had a pre-purchased ticket ended up waiting about 40 minutes later in the evening.

1. It was my boy Kent D's birthday and he wanted to party like a Rock Star...indeed we did...twice over.  We got bottle service inside the club and in the middle of the madness which is the best way to rock it out at XS. 

2. Before we got blitz and started fist pumping, we tipped the 300 lb bouncer so he can keep an eye on us and our table. Luckily we did because some guy tried to help himself to one of our Goose and the bouncer put a smack down on his A$$. 

3. There was plenty of talent and a few bums. Get rid of the bums (thanks 300lb bouncer) and keep the talent.

Because it was so big I felt like I could just explore all sorts of nooks and crannies here. The small dance floor in the water was a trip. The cabanas on the second floor were cool if you had such cash to flash. Plenty of girls took advantage of the multiple stripper poles everywhere - so there was free entertainment there.

The line to get in was massive, but moved surprisingly fast, especially compared to Tryst which was a miniature version of XS (literally) and almost as expensive.

I got in for free and I think my boyfriend's cover was 50.00 or something? We had to wait in an obscene line. There was a girl with a clipboard and a somewhat authoritative air near the beginning of the line. I saw a guy slip her a 100.00 and she let him right in. So avoid the line with a Benjamin, if you hate lines as much as I do. If we'd known that, we'd have saved ourselves 30 minutes. 

It's pretty cheesy. If you just like to dance, fine. But you can do that lots of places. XS doesn't offer good enough ambiance to warrant the hype and the wait. And the cover. 

There are girls walking around with shots to sell. Does that paint the picture? It's like a frat party, only for slightly older people who now have more cash than sense. There's definitely a fashion scene here...the people watching wasn't bad. Some Jersey Shore types for sure. 

The music was good. On either side of the dance floor, there's a girl dancing on a box, with a tired I've-been-doing-this-all-night expression. (Even though they rotate the dancers like every 15 minutes.) I don't know...that part seemed just on the edge of cheesy.

Also, every table and every lounge was marked ""reserved"" which would be believable if there were actually people sitting there.

The structure is beautiful, with plush carpeting in the indoor section of the club, and a very grecian style cabana\/ pool\/ outdoor section. 

This all comes with it's price. I honestly believe it is just too pricey to be justified. They have no specials for locals (which most night clubs do), unless you have a inside friend to help you out. Its $50 for cover, and $20 if  you want to haggle a host to get you to the front of the line (cause you will be waiting for awhile if you get there by 11 ish).

Disorganized much? We were standing in the hotel guest line too and it ended up being a jumble of people standing there.

Anyways we ended up waiting 45 minutes because they didn't have a set system of letting people in.  The person that was running the line finally felt sorry for us because we were told that it would take 15-20 minutes.  I would of left if it wasn't for the fact that most of my friends were in there already.

Once you get in though, the club is really nice.  It has a indoor\/ outdoor portion which was nice if you needed some fresh air.  Drinks were really expensive but what can you expect from a vegas club.  There were areas where you could sort of sit down if you didn't get bottle service which -ladies - is great if you're wearing crazy heels and need a break.

Guest services pointed us in another direction, the next location pointed us somewhere else. Eventually it led to my girlfriend and her friend cussing out managers galore.

Now if that doesn't excite you I don't know what will cause I'm STILL BUZZIN.

Hit me up if you want my guys number and I'll call in a favor.  Who knows he might even hook up a few drink tickets.  Just make sure you've got your ratios right cause ain't nobody got time for a group of dudes LOL.

It was my first time at XS and it just blew my expectations out of the water!
Went there on a saturday night and the line was longggggg. Waited for almost 2 hours to get in but was still fun because we met a lot of people also in line and just had fun killing time. We almost got kicked out of line cause we were gettin kind of rowdy =). OH! security was cool. they let us drink our nice lil home made beverages in line. which probably saved me $$$ from buying drinks in the club

Entrance for guys is $30 =( BUT i would of paid $50 with no hesitation.
Once in.. i was in awe. Place was packed and i didnt see an inch of space! went to the bar.. went to get an adios for a whopping $16!! first and last drink i got for the night =\/

They have a dance floor, which i thought was kinda small, but what makes this place is the pool area. You had people taking off they're shoes and dancing knee high in the water.

 I've got to say there are a lot of cute good looking Asians here!!!

I've never drove here and parked so I don't know what parking is like, but if you taxi, Uber, or Lyft, they would drop you off in front and when you enter...YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY TURN LEFT FOR GUEST LIST LINE!! IF you go to the right...you'll be going to the exit of XS. People often get confused...so I'm telling you right now.

When I came with my group this past Saturday, the line wrapped around like 4 times or so. I think maybe most people are celebrating that they're graduating or after finals....who knows. One of my friends come here more than I and she said it was the longest she's ever seen like ever! I think that they were just not letting people in because some of my other friends (who were already in) said there's not a lot of people inside. 

We waited for 1 hour to get in. Got dropped off at the club around 10:50pm and got in around 12:15am. So the girls didn't get to get free drink tickets.

It was super super super cold when we went. I saw girls with club dresses and a big winter jacket. DANG IT I wished I knew that I could bring my winter jacket too. It was 35 Degrees out side. I was with more guys than girls ...and the guys didn't want to pay more money to be inside the club, so we stayed outside. It was so cold, even when I was standing near the heat lamp. THANK GOODNESS girls can request towels when we were cold. The towel was a life saver for me!!! 

My group was SO EXTRA that night, but it was a night to remember, they were dancing on top of those platforms that was in the pool and dance battling other people HAHAHA and joining other groups to dance with!!

When Alesso ended, we got to go inside the club...OMG it was the best feeling when you can feel some warmth inside! My group took over one of the table cuz those people were leaving and we were dancing near the strip pole and on the top edges of the chairs. 

Inside was just as nice as the outside. However, I really prefer the inside, since the music is louder and it's so warm!",4,3,3

A promoter approached us as we were leaving the Venetian and promised us free cover and a table. Drai's promoter promised us a free table the night before as well but did not deliver but the XS promoter gave his word that we would get a table to rest at. Even though we were already on the list for Marquee we decided to keep our options open agreed to be on the list for XS as well. Around 9 PM, XS' promoter texted us to follow up and strongly encouraged us to arrive before 1AM. We ultimately decided to head to XS because of Lil Jon. The guest list line seemed longer than the regular line when we arrived at midnight.The line moves relatively fast as the girls checks us off the guest list and hands us two complimentary drink cards each. Comp cards are good for wells drinks only max value $20 (champagne, midori sour, etc). Apparently not every one receives a drink card and a of lot the people in line were a bit outraged by it. We get through line fairly quick and made a bee line for the bar since our comp cards expire at 1AM. After fighting out of the bar with our free drinks I texted the promoter about the table and he advised us to meet him by the golden stair well. While we were waiting some random guy invited us to his table with his friends. Thirty minutes later promoter texts me to apologize and says hes a little drunk. It seems I never see a promoter once we get on the list. In the end it worked out for us free cover, free drinks (ALWAYS tip the bartender), free table with liquor.

 The con of the night was that someone STOLE an iPhone 6 out of one of our girl's purse on the dance floor. She had her purse on her body at all times. Towards the end of the night, my friend went around looking for it and she came across other girls who also had their phone stolen out of their purse. I'm guessing this happens often because there is a long detailed review on tripadvisor if you google ""David Guetta at XS - Serious iPhone Theft Scam!!"" and ""Iphone Phone Theft!! XS Night Club @ Encore @ Wynn."" We filed a police report and and a lost and found incident report at the Wynn the following morning. I asked the security guard if it happens often and he said ""Surprisingly, no"" despite all the reviews online that say other wise. Overall it was great clubbing experience for us.

UPDATE

A month after the iPhone was stolen. I received a text from ""imessage.sms.info@cloud.com""  claiming someone signed on to my friends iMessage on Dan's iphone 5. This is part of an elaborate phishing scam to retrieve your iCloud password. Initially, my number was listed as the contact number if found however my friend had already placed her phone on lost and erase mode. Both of us received the same text message.",2,1,1

The one extra star is for decor.

Music was good, club was gorgeous...the pools, places to sit even if you don't have bottle service, lights, heat lamps, everything..I loved it, nicest club I've been to in Vegas. 

So why only A-ok? Because I agree with those who say the bouncers are dicks. Long story short, some insecure, stumpy Asian girl started shit with my friend, and somehow they both ended up getting kicked out. Our group decided to leave because we couldn't abandon our friend, and just because we were arguing with the bouncer, saying it's unfair our friend got kicked out because she didn't start anything...he ended up saying something like, ""since you guys are acting like this, i'm going to let the other girl back in."" and he told the other bouncer to let that b**** back in, as if it gave him some kind of satisfaction pissing us off. eff you for thinking you're high and mighty for controlling who goes in and out of the club.

This place is well lit (which is nice because I want to actually see where I'm going). The place is quite colorful and very upscale-looking. The highlight is definitely the pool area, which has lounges right nearby and in the water. The whole place looked amazing. The club is connected to the outside (where the pool area is), which gives off the major source of air for the club. So, you can actually breathe! Also, the people who go here seemed to be more dressy compared to the other clubs.

The only downside was the music. Most of the time it was good, but I noticed the beats got repetitive after awhile. Either way I had fun. As for the drinks, they are expensive! 16 bucks for a shot. But then again, it's Vegas, so I guess it's ""okay.""

After about 2-3 minutes, we were asked to leave (only us two since we were wet).

No amount of alcohol could have made this experience tolerable, and I'm far from your typical debby downer.

We arrived around 11 after catching the late show of La Reve and were pumped to check out the 'hottest club on the strip' but the enthusiasm quickly died. The wait to get a drink was ridiculous and if there was alcohol in my $12 vodka cranberry, my tastebuds sure didn't notice it. It would have taken $200 in drinks to start feeling a buzz. And I'm a light weight. 

Finding a place to take in the night was a challenge - people were everywhere. People were so close together that I could barely breathe, especially when Paris Hilton and Too Short got in the spotlight and everyone in the place pushed their way toward us. It was like being in the front row of a concert with every passing dude thinking he had the liberty to start grinding on me. It was too packed to get around to see any of the cool looking parts of the club.

Here's a little story to illustrate the essence of the people patronizing XS. After exiting the club, a group of average looking gentlemen approached and asked for us to take a photo of them with their camera. My attractive and personable friend pleasantly obliged and when they came back to get their camera, one of them said, 'ew. why are we even talking to you?' REALLY?

Last time I went was last month Sep. 2010.  We came at 9pm and it was barely picking up, but we got in within 10 minutes of being in line.  My friend had an incident where he ripped his pants from swinging on the stripper pole in our Party Bus, so they didn't let him in.  In fact, he came back 2 times; the first time they told him to staple his pants, then denied and said sew it up, then last time they told him to get new pants, so he decided to go elsewhere.   I was already in and gone by that time, but the next day we had some good laughs about it.  

The dance floor itself is a bit on the small side, but there's a lot more people in the outdoor portion of the club by the pool area to mingle with.  Once it hits prime time midnight, the dance floor is really packed so good luck trying to go in and out through that, take the side paths to get in and out.

$20 cover charge for ladies was completely reasonable (I think it was $40 for guys?).

Thankfully, some people from our group came earlier in the day and scored the ladies free tickets. Woot!

The guys opted to get a table and do bottle service in order to get in. The table they reserved was right along the pool, with 2 lounge beds in the water, and a shallow area where we could dance! My feet were thankful for this, as I had been wearing 4-inch heels for the past 3 nights. I think I was the first one in the water, I was so excited! 

The first week of November offered the perfect weather. It was sunny in the day time, and just right at night. Half of the nightclub is outdoors and it wouldn't have been as enjoyable once it started getting cold. Really though, this club was gorgeous. There were booths, cabanas, and even rooms that opened out to the club that you could reserve. They really catered to parties of all sizes. There was even a casino area in the middle of the pool. Some drunk-tard decided against walking around the pool to get there... he jumped in and swam across the pool instead!

Drinks were yummy. I renewed my love for vodka here.. especially Belvedere vodka. After 3 shots and 2 vodka cranberries, I was on a mission... to get my dance on! Too bad the music was off. It went from Trance, to Reggaeton, to... who the hell knows? Can you play some hip-hop please? If anything is a buzz kill, it's bad music. 

None-the-less I had an amazing time at XS. It was all a blurr by the end of the night... and I can't wait to do it all over again!",18,13,15

I was there to celebrate my college graduation but my short encounters with the staff at this club tremendously altered my celebratory state. My 4 friends and I were on the guest list, but upon arrival, we were sent to the back of the line. This is fine, but the bouncers later came up to us and put us back in the front of the line. I do not understand what type of policies that they have in place for things like that to happen. 

However, it gets worse. Once we finally managed to get into the club, we definitely needed a drink. Myself and two other girls ordered ""vodka cranberries"", and we aren't the picky-type so we obviously wanted the WELL vodka. I have been a bartender throughout my time in college, and it is common sense that when it is not specified, well alcohol should be used. 

Our tab was $105. (Hahah is that a joke? I still feel like I'm being pranked.) I asked the bartender- a blonde female- for an itemized receipt in which we were charged for grey gooses. If grey goose is their well, I am COMPLETELY fine with that! We know Vegas is disgustingly expensive! And that's exactly what she rudely said. ""Grey Goose is our well."" However, I could see in plain sight that they indeed had Absolut, Stoli, Ketel One, Tito's, etc. 

My point is this- This club should not allow their employees to take advantage of people. Being a nice club in Vegas does not give them permission to borderline steal from their customers. I am angry that I was taken advantage of, and I felt that this would be the correct manor to approach this issue.

THAT BEING SAID, the club is very nice, I do like the setup, and many of their employees are actually very polite. I do recommend going to this club IF you are careful about the scamming bartender(s). This goes for any and all clubs in Vegas.",2,2,0

My only complaint was the guest list. Husband and I called twice- both times confirmed on the club's guest list.  But when we get there, no go- they tell us we're not on the list. Apparently, we should have asked for the name of the person we spoke to- even though we called the number listed on their own website and neither time did the person gave us their freaking name nor told us we needed that info for the guest list (No, no, you're totallllllly on the list- don't worry about it lol!).

I was disappointed, though, that once you were on the patio..it was an approximate 1-hour wait to get back in the club. A nuisance for sure...I just spent most of my time on the patio where the music and crowd were just as pumping.

After some bickering they let us in and we found that half the tables in the club were unoccupied and they were most definitely not sold out. 

With some pushing we eventually claimed a table and the night was saved. My poor friend who organized this part of the bachelor party weekend definitely lost a few hairs from the stress of the table initially falling through.

Bartenders lack a hustle in their service. Took him 5 Minutes to make 8 drinks. Exactly 8 minutes by the time the point of sale was completed. Tall skinny shot glasses harbor bacteria inside since it's impossible to clean the base. Clean glasses in black bustubs which traditionally hold dirty dishes. Bartenders fingering the mouth of glasses as they unstack them. Stick to the $11 beer.  

The Dj lineup  is quite deceptive. They book hip hop based DJ's who are then instructed to play EDM 90% of the time. Keeps the 'darker' crowd from getting too hood. Went straight from Fetty wap to Taylor Swift. Nigga!  Generally clean venue, extremely polite security. 

 Best service is the bathroom. You must take a dump here. 100% bathroom discretion. Perfect for _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .

It's absolutely beautiful - probably the nicest looking club in Vegas in my opinion. Unfortunately, there were a few things that made me knock XS down a peg on my list. 

My fiancé & I visited XS last Saturday night. Unfortunately, we were unable to be put on guest list, since they do not do guest list reservations Friday & Saturday nights. I hate waiting in line, but, I figured with this being THE spot to be in Vegas right now, I would suffer in line with everyone else. 

Fortunately, the line was not overly ridiculous around 10:30 pm. We did wait about 15-20 minutes, which I thought was pretty acceptable, considering the facts. When we walked in, we made our way over to the bar, where we ordered drinks. Took forever to get the bartender's attention, but once we did, and we tipped him well, he paid good attention to us. Even lit my cigarette for me several times. Nice.

Unfortunately, it was kind of cool and windy when we were there, so very few people were migrating outdoors. Which meant an already busy club felt even busier since we were only using half the space the club had to offer. By 11 pm, XS was so crowded, we couldn't move and had no where to stand comfortably. We tried going outside, but after shivering for a few moments and taking a few pictures of the gorgeous pool with not one person in or around it, we went back inside to jam in like sardines with everyone else. My already sore feet were stepped on several times, and I was somewhat unhappy about it.

I know a lot of people complain about the music being ""housey"" here, but I didn't think it was too much for the average person. Most of the ""house"" songs they played were things most people recognize, even if they do not consider themselves to really listen to this kind of music. They did mix in a few top 40 hits, and overall, it was all fun up-tempo things that you can dance to. Better than I expected!

By 1 am, this place was so crowded that we just couldn't take it any more. Not to mention, there were TONS of douchebags there that night. Maybe it was just a bad night, but I hope this place is not like this all the time. There were definitely WAY more guys than girls, and it was a little disappointing. I was also disappointed that the bouncers seemed to be letting in just anyone, dressed right or not. I think their standards could have been a little higher giver their popularity and by the looks of it, the line at 1 am or so when we left was 5 times that of when we came. Some of those people must have to wait a long ass time. 

But here's the best part -- When my fiancé & I went to leave, I followed behind him as he squeezed through the crowd. I felt a hand on my ass, and thinking it was my man's, I didn't think anything of it. A few seconds later, I asked him if that was his hand grabbing my butt and he looked at me so confused, and said, ""no?!"" Yep, time to go.

I heard Carrot Top was there that night, although we didn't see him, probably because we left too early from being so squished. Overall, I think it could be an awesome place to be, but next time I go back, I will go on a Sunday or Monday night where it will be hopefully a little less busy.",1,1,1

Celebrities can be seen left and right, and there is a huge pool in the middle for patrons to enjoy themselves in. There are many tables as well, for those seeking bottle service. As for the cover charge and drink prices, we are in Vegas after all, and we are at the 'best' nightclub in Vegas.

The DJ played a lot of house\/electronica, and it was a pleasure to listen to. I agree with many that they usually don't play a lot of hip hop; as much as I love hip hop, I love house more. No problem for me. There isn't much room for those looking to dance - just the tiny spot in front of the DJ. XS is more of a bottle service\/pool\/tables\/drinking place than a place to dance around in my opinion.

XS was gorgous inside- sound system is amazing despite the open space. And speaking of the open space- the club is airy and it feels wonderful to not be packed and sweaty.

The pool area is amazing- you can chill, dance with your sore feet in the water and just enjoy a little break in between furious bouts of dancing to some amazing music. Top 40 and some House gems. The music was perfectly balanced and kept us dancing all night.

It's glamorous and feels like you've been invited to an exclusive party just for the elite. It just has that effect on you. When you enter you walk through the dance floor and it's just crazy! The lights, the go go dancers, the people - it just makes you wanna dance. Then you walk further and you're greeted with the open night sky, a sparkling pool, and a beautiful array of palm trees and lights. Girls, thank the heavens because the bathroom is NOT crowded. I repeat, there is not a line!! A first in club history.

Grab some drinks and get your girls because I had the best time just dancing in the shallow portion of the pool! We grabbed one of those lush seats on the side of the pool so we could take our heels off and soak them while we danced! 

BE WARNED: This place is expensive. Guys, prepare to drop some bills for the ladies. The poker table by the bars might tempt you too. That's right! There's a poker table!

The only downsides which the club made up for later was:
-I wasn't excited waiting in line for 1.5 hours (I lost the effects of the Patron I had while pre-partying). The line seemed like it was never ending! The cover charge is $20. Who cares though! XS was poppin'!",3,1,2

You can't really dance to it, unless jumping up and down and banging your head counts as dancing.  It's also such a tease because you think one of your favorite songs is starting but you soon realize that your beloved ""sexy back"" has been butchered by the house DJ and you end up having to convulse to the repetition of ""baby I'm your slave"" set over techno beats for 15 minutes.  I can understand maybe a half hour set of house music for the hardcore ravers at a club, but this place had it playing the ENTIRE night.  Come ON.  

Other than the music this place is slammin.  My buddy Jimmy got us all in through one of the many hookups he has.  He kept pumping this place up, saying it was a 100-million-dollar club and it just opened.  Well that 100 mil was well spent cuz this place is just huge and beautiful.

Heavy handed security coming in took random items, it's not clear what is and isn't OK to have. Good thing the line was so slow, 'the divas' didn't take to the stage until 2 freaking am... people were getting pissed waiting. I felt bad for people that spent thousands on tables. For that price, big artists should have better stamina. Meh. 

The club itself is nice, ok, but the guest experience just absolutely sucks. MAJOR over serving going on, despite the drinks being insanely overpriced, even for Vegas. Many, many drunk and obnoxious people with dangerously dainty security on the inside. 

During the minute my husband was in the bathroom, a man put his hands on me and 'jokingly' tried to push me in the pool. I told him off before my husband got back, but I watched security allow him to continue drunkenly stumbling around the edge of the pool making his rounds harassing women. Part of the evenings entertainment\/worry\/horror was watching security allow drunk white men to fall into the pool constantly and splash women. I clutched my $25 double titos and sipped slowly all night, watching the sloppy men around me like a hawk so that their wobbly missteps wouldn't make me suddenly go for a swim. 

Please have a heart XS. The $17(!!!!) bottled water incentivizes dehydration and that is just so freakin irresponsible. Never in my life will I go back to a place where the water is $17 damn dollars. 

Sorry Chainsmokers, you've got to deal with the golden cuffs of a stick up their ass club for the next three years. Oy. Guess I'll have to wait for a few more albums to see them again... 

Vegas nightclub competition is fierce, there are plenty of other great nightclubs that won't charge you a couple hundred bucks to feel like a peasant. Guest experience matters for everyone, and from what I'm reading from other reviews bottle service doesn't even make you feel special.

Then when i stepped up and ask the guard he said u need to have 3 rd stamps! I ask where can i get it, he redirected me to entrance. 
So annoyed, i rushed back to entrance to ask why they didnt put stamp for us.

My girlfriend and I went with another couple, so since our ratio of men to women was 1:1 we got in for free. We were put on the guest list (I forgot the persons name) but you're suppose to message one of the promoters from Yelp to ""hook it up."" My girlfriend and her friend were given free complimentary drink cards (one each) that they could redeem once they got inside. This seemed like a good deal but it doesn't apply to any other drinks besides rum and coke or vodka and red bull once you try to redeem it. And if you don't have a free complimentary drink card, the drinks I mentioned are $14 dollar each for a small glass. 

So, upon entering the club looked huge. You see a view of the pool in the background which made it look very spacious. Wrong! After a few minutes of taking everything in, we realized there's no where to sit. So, unless you're willing to drop cash on a reserved table you better find a good spot to chill or hit the dance floor. The dance floor was so crowded that I could feel other people's bodies around me. Also, people have no common Courtesy when walking around the club or on the dance floor. They'll just push you to get through.. 

We only stayed for 2-3 hours but overall we had a good time. We'll probably come back another time.

P.s. Guys, you don't have to dress super nice like I did. All the other men were in basic dress shirts and jeans. My friend and I were the only ones with ties lol.. Just saying in case you feel like you have to dress up. That only applies to women when it comes to clubbing.",1,1,0

I went to XS for Tiesto night with three other girls after being promised by two different legit hosts that we would be able to get in on the reduced admission guest list ($20 for girls, $50 for guys). We were in line by 10 pm and did everything as we were told. When we got to the front of the line, however, Joe stopped us and told us there was no such thing as a reduced admission guest list. My friend and I whipped out our cell phones to show him the text messages we'd received literally minutes ago from our promoters, who were both working at Tryst that night. Joe basically told us he thought we were bullshitting (even though we told him he could check the numbers) and said he was only doing his job and we would have to pay $100 to get in (after telling our other friends $75 about 20 minutes earlier). Um... I'm sorry? I understand it's Tiesto night, but it's not even 11 pm, we're four girls on the guest list, and you're telling us to pay $100 to get into your club? We pointed out the absurdity of this and Joe told us in the rudest, most sarcastic tone ever that the only way he would accept proof of the ""reduced admission guest list"" we claimed existed was if we dragged one of our promoters over from Tryst to walk us in. We asked, very patiently, if we could go over and get a video recording or signature or something as proof. He said no and refused to offer a reason why, instead telling us over and over again to step out of line. 

By this point we were tired of wasting time when he was just being an asshole for the sake of being an asshole so we finally complied, but instead of leaving we went to go talk to Eric, who wrote us a slip within 10 seconds of us showing him our texts. After we got in my friend went to go give Joe a piece of her mind, and he conveniently slammed the door in her face.

Even as people left the covered area, guests outside were not let in.

It's way too overcrowded, but this club beats any LA club with a clean sweep because of the people there. You can't not be entertained by all those random crazies and happy-go-luckies on E.

I agree with whichever reviewer said that it's difficult to get your way to the front of your bar if you're not aggressive, and pretty difficult to get served by the bartenders if you don't have (or don't look like you have) a shlong. I don't mind because I can cut with the best of 'em, but if you're one of the less aggressive folk then this may not be the place for you unless you're planning to pre-game like nobody's business. I'd advise y'all to be prepared to wait a good 20-30 mins for a drink. Not too bad with all those drunkies and druggies entertaining you while you wait.

The bar outside is much less crowded (by the pool? I don't know I was way too drunk to keep a mental blueprint), and the view is much nicer. Music wasn't all too great. I was pretty inebriated and didn't really dance very much, and I don't usually even require much music. I feel like if there were less people there it would be a much more successful club for me--I don't like crowds; I felt like I was suffocating.

And just a heads up, if you're going to meet with people there good luck! I knew of at least a handful of people who had reserved tables there and I couldn't find a single table of familiar faces. It's a ginormous club.

They're open from 10PM-4AM with a $20 entrance for women\/$30 for men ($50 for men on Sat.), $10ish for a drink.

They enforce dress code obviously, and there's usually a long wait to get in.

Guys, don't try to go on a Saturday with only the homies unless you have bottle service or know somebody that can hook it up. We went last week and we had 10 guys and 3 girls. The general admission by the way is changed now. It's on the other side of the hotel rather than in the middle (that has become the bottle service line). General admission enters outside the pool area. The guys in our group had to pay $100 to the promoter so that us girls can get us in for free and then pay additional $30 at the door. Otherwise, girls have to pay $20 on Saturdays, unless, you're HOT, then yea, you don't have to worry about it.

Saw Skrillex there, with a faint hope that he'd play some more interesting tunes, but the crowd forced him to stick with trap and tired mainstream dubstep.  Skrilly attempted to guide the crowd into more interesting territories, but they weren't having it that night.  Have to hand it to him, he was reading the crowd like a champ, which is what separates the DJs from the David Guettas of the world. But as all large-scale DJ artists go, they eventually become a victim of their own success. 

If you are a music lover and are out for a night dancing and to experience some cool new tunes with people of the same cut, pass.  Perhaps it's better during the week once the weekly El Niño of LA insecurity moves out of town, but on the weekends the pattern is the same in every major casino club. Someone has to pay the shareholders, and with the Asian gamblers that fueled Vegas in the 90's spending their money in Macau these days, the pocketbooks of millenial parents are filling the gap.

Then stop right now, hit up the ATM (at with at least 2 separate cards because your Capital One Credit-Building card has a $250 cash advance limit on it), crush a 12-pack of pre-game Natty Lights with your bros, and get in line, because you're going to have one of the greatest forgotten nights of your life that will be memorialized by your hangover and pieced together over the following days from stories from your bros blurry iphone pictures, and unreplied texts to numbers you forgot to save in your phone. 

If you're a real pro, be sure to keep your phone out the entire evening and record everything like a military war reporter. 

Otherwise, your money would be better spent at Spearmint Rhino, where at least they acknowledge why you're there in the first place. 

If you find yourself in Vegas on a work trip and rather not attend that conference in the morning without a hangover, be sure to plan ahead, and find one of the thousands of promoters desperately wandering the strip trying to hit their headcount quotas so they can update their LinkedIn profiles with ""Event Production"" endorsements, and get on the ""Guest List"" which is really just the little-league soccer of getting into clubs - everyone gets a participation trophy for trying ahead of time.

I've been twice, once in March and again in August.  In March, we got a table in the perfect location.  Front middle right by the pool, so we got the best of both worlds....close to the dance floor, but right outside to get a little more chilled mood.

Key issues are: 1) bouncers (real assholes) 2) too crowded which make it not worth it.

Bouncers will shout at you, kick you out, etc like if they have all the powers. It's really unpleasant.
Moreover, club tends to be overcrowded so you wait long time in the queue (it can easily take 2h) and once inside, you often cannot go on the dance floor until someone leaves and it's really hard to circulate. So this club is about waiting inside\/outside while being mistreated by bouncers. Not worth it.

In addition to all the positive testimonials, I already had experienced Wynn's Tryst and had a good time, so I naturally only expected better for my first visit to XS. Let's just say in the end, I was slightly disappointed. I didnt hate the place afterwards, but I didnt love it. Would I go again? Maybe, but i would definitely wait in line and pay a cover for a place I know I've enjoyed in the past, like Tryst or Tao.

Getting in:

XS is opened from Friday through Monday. It's one of the few clubs open on Monday night in Vegas. I had already witnessed the RIDICULOUS lines for XS on Saturday and Sunday night, so I planned it so our party would go in on Monday, hoping this would be the slowest night. Luckily for us, it was! It was, by no means, SLOW, but the line was like a 15 minute wait. Customers who are staying at Encore can get in for 10 dollars (female or male). Fortunately, we utilized the services of a promoter and got ourselves on a guest list that allowed us in for free. The bouncers weren't more rude or anal than expected, and that's basically all you can ask for in terms of service at a night club. Free admission + short wait + hottest club in Vegas = so far so good, right?

....Wrong...

Music\/Atmosphere

When I walked down the stairs and I got a wide view of the club...one thing struck me - ""this looks just like Tryst!"" I honestly feel it's almost IDENTICAL. Same staircase that opens up to the club, same open air dancefloor facing a body of water outside, same bar areas located on the right and left of the club. I liked Tryst, so it didn't bother me a whole lot that XS looked pretty much the same. 

The main problem is associated with the music. Now, I admit I went in unaware if there was a special event or a special DJ, but the music was not something I could dance to aka mostly techno. I heard XS rotates music selection every hour or so, but I was there for over 2 hours and did not get much change from the same ol techno. Of course, please disregard this flaw if you are into techno and like such music in the club. But for most of the clubbers out there, I would confidently say that they prefer pop\/hiphop be played and I got none of that on my XS trip. 

The crowd:

Mixed, no particular type of club hopper stood out to me. Really packed, but nothing out of the ordinary. I squeezed my way successfully through to the dance floor and to the bar with no problem.

Overall, XS was eh. It was nothing special. Tryst has everything this place has minus the techno music. I'm not exactly sure where the hype emerges from other than being one of the newest clubs in Vegas. Sure, I know it is very much possible I went on a bad night and I am completely open to that idea. However, in my mind, why risk getting disappointed by a place that already has disappointed you the first time when you can go to a club that ensures your night life happiness (ahem Tao.)",1,0,0

Gold covered walls and decor, poles, good variety of music, quick service at the bar. I've heard that it's something like a 9.9 million dollar club. 

The tables for bottle service looked really small, so I don't know if it's worth getting one. 

The set up is very similar to Tryst, but the outside area is what makes this club so amazing. A huge shallow swimming pool that looked like a lake, with beds in the water. Yes, you can chill and lay on these things. There's a walkway to the middle of the pool where there's a big bar shaped like a carousel. The waterfall at Tryst has nothing on this club.

Ever since the Wynn opened up Encore which contains this glamourous night club, the Wynn's once THE spot, Tryst, has went down to shambles. Well, not totally since people still go, but just catch my drift. 

There is a LONG line to get into this place starting around 9:30pm. And if you're lucky and speak to the bouncers, you can skip the line and head to the front. Luckily my girls and I were able to do just that. According to most of the workers we spoke with, this place has no guest list on Fridays and Saturdays, meaning you have to pay cover $30 for guys, and $20 for girls. Boo hoo, but you'll understand why once you enter...

This gorgeous, huge, classy club. You go up the stairs and WA-LA you oversee the huge dance floor with bars to your sides while you hear the mix of hip hop and pop play as you strut yourself onto the dance floor. Pass the dance floor is the gorgeous, glistening pool with a casino in its center and cabanas on the perimeter of the water. There is plenty of space to mingle and socialize. And dancing doesn't have to be on the dance floor or the platforms with poles, but the pool as well. That's right ladies, take those heels off and soak your feet on in, because your feet don't have to hurt tonight. And no, you don't have to dip yourself 5 ft in. There's a shallow end that has 3-5 inches of water. Can't get your outfit ruined!

And fear not if you're gambling by the pool and don't want to walk back inside in the club for a drink. There's another bar right behind the casino with more cabanas to sit and relax in.

Granted, I'm not the clubbing type, but one does not have to be to recognize that this place is totally awesome. I was in awe the moment I stepped onto the huge dance floor with VIP tables scattered to your left and to your right and then off to the gorgeous patio with a sparking pool. I must have spent a good ten minutes spacing out and absorbing all of XS' seductive beauty.

Arrived around 10. Ladies got in for FREE! Guys paid $20? Yes, the lines seem really long but they move you in pretty quickly. Oh btw, unless you're a pretty lady, don't even think about trying to jump in with your friends who are already standing in line; Within seconds, a bouncer will shoo you off and tell you to get to the back of the line. But like I said, you get in quickly since they card you while waiting in line. The crowd is not as diverse, but it sure is a HELL of a lot classier than the sleazeballs at Vanity. That's a different review.

Spent the whole evening outdoors. The entire area was never packed. The air was crisp and breezy. The music was cool... Frankly, I can't recall, but it was definitely danceable. The whole atmosphere and vibe was chill. The bar is never crowded. The drinks were good; Five shots for about $75 total. Expected. If you want water, don't just ask for water unless you want to shell out about $8 for a bottle of Fiji. I learned my lesson after asking for 2 bottles of water and getting charged $16-18 at Tryst. Ha! Ask for TAP. The bathroom is ALWAYS empty and clean. The lady in there is such a sweetie, so tip her well! 

When leaving, I had to maneuver through the dance floor. It was hot and sweaty, thick and musky. If I had been stuck indoors, my review would positively be a negative. I guess that's what indoor clubbing is like... 

Anyhow, I'm glad my drunk a$$ could even make it out of there. Sincerest apologies to Vdara because my body could not process the toxins and therefore expelled into your nice and conveniently laid out waste bins that lead to the elevator and up to my suite.

However, like most clubs in Vegas, the cover is expensive ($30 for guys, $20 for girls and Encore guests - there's no guestlist), the drinks are nearly $20 a pop, and terrible, terrible DJ. I personally cannot stand mash-ups of terrible hip hop songs, but I guess the majority of club-goers are down with that and\/or have short attention spans. They seriously need to get some good celebrity DJs in there -- they make enough money to have one every night.

The doormen and staff are actually really nice, and luckily we got to bypass the insane line. It looked like the line was rather quick though, and they started letting people inside on Friday at around 9:30pm.

The huge pool area is a nice place to lounge, and you can get bottle service out in the cabanas as well. The bartenders work fast, so getting drinks from the bars isn't a problem. 

There are a lot of beautiful people (ow! 8\/14 gallery, page 6 http:\/\/www.xslasvegas.com\/flash\/index.php), and the go-go dancers are pretty hot... so yes, there are a lot of things that make XS way better than all of the other big clubs I've been to in Vegas.

-It's super huge
-There are places to chill
-There are places to dance
-Love that the poles are less trashy because they are lamps
-The set up is amazing
-A swimming pool?! Yes!
-Bottle Service all around
-Strawberries and chocolate with champagne! Yes!
-Super efficient bathroom line. Girls you know this is super necessary. 

Cons:
-No guestlist. 
-Doorman was kind of a dick and not helpful in the daytime.

I felt like Chris Tucker in this scene from Rush Hour 2

http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PrAIA4c_Mtk

So any place that gives me the feeling of ""This place is off the hook!"" deserves that 4th star.

I mean even for me, someone who normally leaves his credit card back in the room so I don't get stuck with reserving the table .... I knew that if I really wanted to go in, I better not take any chances.  And what do you know ... no one else wanted to slide their card.  

Fuck it ... XS is one of the newer spots in LV and I like new shit.

From the moment I walked into the newer portion of the Wynn called Encore, I could just see why they called the club XS.  I mean there was an excess of just about everything.  And when I say everything, I mean everything.  

Just come check it out, it's nice!

Just don't over do it like I did because you'll be calling it a night early after meeting everyone from the bachelorette parties, birthday parties, NBA players no longer in the playoffs and the dude who's table you climbed over because you couldn't find the path to the exit.

Let me give you a tip.  You really don't need to pay for table service if there's a small group of you unless you really want to.  Just go in line early, meaning before 10p and then when they start letting people in, pay cover and get your hand stamped then go out and you can come back later.  

That's right folks, they allow re-entry.

The place is huge inside and outside, yeah outside.  They have a huge outside area where you can just hang out with your group and sit along the planters or they have a gambling area, so you will definitely find some place just to chill and hang even if you don't have a table.

Come and judge for yourself ... I think you'll be impressed with the place.

I got to stick my feet in the jacuzzi and play footsies with the other hotties there (the pool was too cold for my sore metatarsals.)

The blackjack dealer in his red shirt and white sneaks made out for an awesome watch. I think his moves were better than half the folks dancing.

The sound system and lights aren't as great as other clubs, but whatever they have now definitely does the job!

Or anywhere else in the country for that matter. It has become a must-stop every time we're in town. Even our friends who despise nightclubs absolutely love this place.

Perhaps the biggest draw is the combination of indoor and outdoor spaces. If you want to rage out on a crowded dance floor to an A-list DJ, it's simple, stay inside. 
Not your scene? No problem. Take a step outside to find a vast pool area with multiple bars, including one in the middle of the water, and an overall spacious setting (you can still hear the music out here too). We found ourselves spending most of our time outside and probably had just as much fun (if not more) than those inside.

Overall, hands down one of the finest nightlife establishments I've ever seen. You can't go wrong with a night out at XS.

Some XS recommendations:

As much as I enjoy bottle service, this is one of the few venues we didn't feel the need to get it and were perfectly fine with it. With so many different spaces inside and out, it was kind of nice to be able to move around all night and not have to anchor at our table (not to mention bottles here are among the priciest in Vegas). Also, with multiple bars, we never waited more than two-three minutes for a drink, even during peak hours. I should mention that we set up express entry via a third-party promoter which also influenced us not to get bottle service. It was $75, but that included our cover charge (normally $50 or so) and we were escorted past the line and directly into the club, hassle-free. Money well spent, especially for a group of seven guys.

Bring some serious cash. Drinks are not cheap (even by Vegas standards). Pregaming is highly encouraged. 

If you don't have some form of hosted entry or a bottle reservation in place, get there early, especially if you're a group of guys. Despite the venue's large size, the lines start early and you will find yourself stuck in it without the proper accommodations.

Excellent recommendation for a bachelor party.",10,3,2

I've been here twice, both on Sunday nights during the summer so maybe it's because I'm not feeling the outside-only deal where 25% of the people got the memo that they can wear their bathing suits at night.  The outside is gorgeous but it doesn't make me feel like I'm at a club at all.  The ""dance floor"" or whatever right in front of the stage is too small and if you go towards the back where there's A LOT of space, you can't really hear the music or feel comfortable enough to dance because people are just lounging around.  

I'd give this place one more chance simply because people really seem to love it and maybe I've just been going on the wrong nights or I wasn't drunk or enough or I need to wear better shoes.  Maybe on a Saturday.  Maybe during the winter when they actually open up the inside.

Place was off the hook, even though we got here hella late (at 12:30am) - long day at the pool parties and forever long taxi lines at almost all hotels..

The Most Important things:

Good music = check
Good looking people = check
Good ratios of girls to guys = check
Stylish\/modern layout = check 
Reasonable prices drinks = fail

Overall, this place is seriously dope!  Place gets crazy packed, thus it gets really warm\/humid here (even at 1-2am), so dress accordingly. Most of the crowd was dressed nice, although I'm still trying to figure out how a lot of the dudes got in wearing t-shirts.  I thought it was pretty awesome that you could take your shoes off and dance in the water. Make sure to buy your tickets in advance, you'll get in really quick and avoid the nightmare of a line in front of the club.  Also, the taxi lines get CRAZY long at Wynn (like an hour wait) so bounce from the club around 230am otherwise you might have an extra long boring time in line were its even more hot then the club.  Definitely be back next Labor Day!",2,0,0

One bottle ($4-500) per three people and with generous tipping of the host. Another quoted the same ratio but added their own sixty per head personal fee. (WTF?!??) 

I found the best way is to get as many bids as possible and do the ol' fashion negotiating and try to bring that bottle count down. I found the larger the party, the more hosts were willing to work with you. One told me that they each usually could have about four groups each night, so of course they wanted the biggest damage possible.

My recommendation is to get a table inside during the summer or by the pool. . good luck with all the ghetto Asian girls.",5,2,3

-Stripper Poles
-Good music
-Italian Models
-pool

-Perverts

Wowsers, is it nice!  The breeze was hot, but just the location alone was cherry!  We were able to have a fantastic view of the crowd on the dance floor, but still far enough away to enjoy ourselves for a bit alone-time.

The venue is beautiful!!  It sits between 2 hotels and there's 2 sections to this club,  and indoor area with the bar,  seating , dance floor and the outside with the same as well as a nice pool.  I was so surprised\/excited because Diplo just so happened to be DJing that night. So that was awesome!

I as well as my female party guests did feel overdressed. We were all in tight dresses\/skirts and high heels. This club is definitely more chill. It's more of a bikini and high heels kinda place and for guys, you'll pass with a tank top and shorts. 

Overall the staff members were very friendly. The VIP area is set up nicely and the cake they gave me was delicious !! So why only 3 stars? Here it goes. 

As i mentioned, we ordered bottle service. Our reservations were from 11 pm to 4 am . We were suppose to recieve 2 bottles of grey goose vodka and a couple of juices, which we did but we didnt get it until 1 am!!! They were having problems processing the credit cards, which we dont understand. Our banks knew we were traveling and they worked literally everywhere else. after trying 5 different cards and 2 hours later we finally got the alcohol. This was a bummer because some of my guests were ready to leave before the party even started because of the long back and forth.  

Another problem we had was that the vip area was very tiny. We had a party of 10 and we received one small love couch that seated 4 people and 5 when we squeezed in and one small table. A lot of my guests had to stand, which really sucked for the girls in high heels. They could also do better about roping off or adding more security to the VIP area because there were numerous times random drunks started coming to our area and harassing my guests and i felt no support from the club to remove them from that area. 

Like I said, I'm not an expert of the club scene or how bottle service works but you would think that if we paid $1400 we would at least get some water being in the desert, but no. If you want water they will charge you a whopping $12 for the HALF size fiji waters.

The guy whose guest list we were on even actually showed us inside the club, and walked us to his table. That was really nice, as he knew the quickest way around the crowd. Which leads to the crowd- there was an insane amount of people. Couldn't even dance because I kept getting bumped into. Apparently the DJ was famous, as people were really excited about him. I have to say he did play the best music of all the Vegas clubs I've been to. The wall decorations are gold female torsos, which I read are molds of actual waitresses who worked there and the gold is real. I didn't appreciate being bombarded with boobs on the walls, but what else do you expect from Vegas.

XS is no different from the usual Vegas clubs: you got the party people jam packed in the middle of the dance floor leaving no room to move or dance, you got the high rollers on the tables INSIDE of XS and those that still wanted a table but couldn't really afford the $$$ on the outside tables of XS. 

I do wish that the Vegas clubs have some kind of maximum capacity because always at around 1-2am, it just gets impossible to maneuver through the dance floor and people just start pushing their way through.

DJs:  This summer alone there are so many amazing DJs lined up and I can't wait to see them all.  Avicii, Tiesto, Calvin Harris, Afrojack, Alesso, Steve Aoki... they can all be found at XS.  It is like EDC spread out over the entire summer.

Venue:  Large enough to let you kinda spread out and get some air.  I like that the outdoor section allows you stroll around the pool while still watching the DJ on the big screen.  You even get to dip your feet in the pool.  I know we have all seen the fb pics since 2009 of girls posing and looking cute in the pool ... but watch out it becomes a hot mess around the pool.  There are guys in dress socks and slacks in there too.  There were two girls that straight up fell in.  Don't get too sloppy!  Keep it classy.  Dance floor gets pretty crowded but don't leave the indoor section if you don't want to get stuck outside when your favorite DJ comes one to play.  They barracade the entry so that it doesn't get too crowded inside.

Crowd:  At least 50% Asian.  Everyone looks pretty decent.  Better looking crowd than some other clubs.  Still feels like everybody is trying to impress people but I don't get that mad douche vibe that I got from the Marquee crowd.  Not sure how easy it will be to actually talk to someone on the dance floor, but try outside haha.  It seriously gets to be a clusterf*ck of people around midnight.

Getting in:  For big events like Tiesto or Avicii it is the easiest to just buy the online presale tickets.  Mike from the Hard Rock Hotel can hook it up and walk your group but prices are variable.  With Mike guys will pay at most $100 but the regular XS line will cost you up to $200 at big events for guys if it is around 1am.  Hit him up or buy your tickets online.

Calvin Harris:  I came to XS last Saturday to see Calvin Harris and boy was it jam packed.  I was one of the unfortunate people who had to watch from outside because we were getting too frustrated with the dance floor and all the pushing.  I haven't been shoved\/spilled\/stepped on that much in a long time.  I am still giving XS a 5 stars because of the quality of DJs and the overall venue.

I feel a sense of exclusivity in being the first to enter a club that features 10,000 lights and a $100,000,000 price tag. The letters of the club--XS--are emblazoned in gold, but they are shaped with sensual curves of the human body that nearly make one sexually attracted to the alphabet. And, the form of the letters tells us something deeper that lies beyond signification and linguistic meaning: EXCESS. At the door, there are gold leaf statues that represent males and females emerging through the void. Some appear to be morphed as if a hybrid entity and many appear to be oscillating between an absolute ecstasy of expression and one of complete pain and agony. The rounded wall of the statues appears curvy like the letters of the club, and it leads onto the dance floor which is surrounded by rows and rows of exclusive tables and booths. A number of Vegas' elites begin to express their Dasein below the thousands of strobes and on top of the finest finished surface of the dance floor. 

A number of times I am kicked out from the high-limits tables whose menus include a $10,000 cocktail, known as the Ono (which comes with a gold necklace and Mont Blanc cuff links, complete with the XS logo) and a $50,000 bottle of Louis Roederer Cristal. I order a $14 Bud Lite at the bar. The one hundred or so workers all position themselves in full view of the dance floor. The workers, with their constant gaze on the dance floor, appear to be waiting for something entirely significant to take place. It is as if they all, collectively, mutter: ""Something will happen."" But, for all of the waiting, nothing ever did take place and, it is likely, nothing ever will at the club. 

The XS and its abysmal state is the highest order of achievement--a nihilistic materiality in which all social forms (dread, greed, joy, excess, excitement, intermingling, self-reflection, loss in the crowd) comingle. XS, besides its unwitting and unapologetic homage to Georges Bataille, signifies the rage that no doubt besets the many who come to Vegas. Any society, Bataille would tell us, is destined to outuse, outlive, and outexpend itself. Vegas, as synecdoche of the United States, is no different in this sense. When we take to the floor of the club and when we react to the pulsation of bass upon our body we have the sensation that we are moving, experiencing, going somewhere, but lest we not forget that we are a part of the foam. 

On the dance floor there is a similar sense of purpose that is shared among the crowd. There is the occasional sense of altruism--such as in a glance that someone makes at you, acknowledging the shared joy of the moment--but so often this sense of community is negated by other urges. The rage of sex comes in as men position to hit on women, competing with each other to assure the stability of their bloodline, and the rage of anger enters as people posture for the best possible view of the pole dancers or for the prime real estate on the dance floor. Like other moments on the Strip, here is combined the deep sense of passion, fulfillment and joy, along with the foreboding presence of dream, apprehension and ambivalence. Whether a dancer on the floor, a bouncer at the door, or a cocktail waitress at one of the tables, there is a shared moment of being at play, but it is not one of purpose and direction, rather one of pure ambivalence. There is no purpose behind the dance on the floor, the flash of lights above us, or the intoxication that enters our body throughout the evening, but we relinquish ourselves to what is put before us. We have the sense that the only reaction to the rage of the world as it pushes against us and our futile attempts to push back is to simply become one with the world, in whatever form it takes. 

At this point in the evening, after the staccato and syncopated beats, the spins, whirls and dives, and the flash, gleans and glows, the floor has become ominous and alien. I only desire to escape, and the bathroom seems to be the obvious place. Like the dance floor and the bars, the restroom is immaculately adorned, but what is most curious to me is the row of abundant hair care products that line the counter near the sink. As I near the counter to wash my hands, one of the two obsequious attendants approaches me, saying, ""Here, anything you like,"" pointing happily to the row of products before me. While washing my hands, I look the products over and glance back at him (still smiling), and just as I am about to get the paper towels from the dispenser, he grabs my hands and, together, we dry my hands. He then grabs the used paper towels from me and throws them into the garbage can. At that point, I determined that I needed to produce a tip from my wallet and while reaching for it, the attendant pulls out a lint duster and begins to wipe down my lint-free shirt, rather vigorously and with great purpose. He says, ""Welcome to XS!",0,0,2

Other trips had been impeded by drunk friends who didn't use the right promoter's name and didn't like to listen to the bouncers, exacerbated by a particular friend who likes to take on a fake British accent with a predilection for flicking people off...but I digress. Bottom line: it was worth the wait.

Steve Aoki was..magical. Waiting in the ridiculous line went by fast waiting videos of him rocking out. Just built up the anticipation. The memory of him rafting on the inflatable raft was...surreal. Confetti everywhere. My friends just as star struck by him as a musician and performer joked about how they would treasure the confetti stuck to the bottom of their heels (jokingly, I think). I dubbed him Asian Jesus and screamed it to anyone in earshot. His music are gospels I'd definitely follow because he converted me to house music (his anyways). Just looked him up on Wikipedia. He majored in Women's Study and Sociology. I don't know if he can get any cooler. Spied Guy Fieri right when we went in. He was funny and we got to take a picture with him.

Anyways, enough gushing. The DJ opening was alright. The music was mainly house, but it was enjoyable. The lines, although really oddly organized because there are Guestlist and General Admission grouped together, went by fast. It's misleadingly short because there is a whole chuck that wraps inside. Had a friend who had a group for table reservations (a shorter and separate line) but they let the guys in but made the girls go in the longer line. Whackiest thing I ever heard. Anyways. Lesson: Boys, get a table. Girls, get a promoter. Get there early but if you see a line, don't get discouraged. Especially if Steve Aoki is playing, which I heard he does on Mondays quite frequently.

From the free voucher (girls you get drink vouchers for guestlist-supposed to be 2, but I only got one, sad face). My drink, Tokyo Iced Tea was weak, but hey, it was free. Joined a separate group at table. Love being at tables because there is SO much space to dance. On the sofa, counter area, or table area. Dance floor- pretty crowded, but pretty manageable. Pretty diverse crowd and none too creepy. I tried a new trick of saying I was in a committed relationship with my girlfriend dance partner and I was the jealous type. Got boys to hug and claim they were in a relationship, too, but just too shy to dance together. Friendly and funny crowd. Everyone is just enjoying the music! :)",2,2,1

XS does an incredible job in hosting talent to draw club goers in Las Vegas.  So as you can expect, look out for long lines and a beautiful crowd.  In my opinion, the best looking crowd in Vegas.

Despite the crazy number of people that are here every night, XS' staff does a great job of organizing and serving the hoards of people.  As always, I recommend table reservations at any club to maximizing your overall experience for the night. 

My only gripe about XS (and the only reason it didn't get five-stars) is the music format.  It's exclusively EDM music.  Not that I don't love EDM, but I can only fist pump for so long.  I love hip-hop and would love to see an open-format on different nights.",2,0,1

That being said I had much higher expectations, and I have much higher standards. In short, the lighting, ambience, pool and barstaff would earn XS 7\/5 stars... but they lose 4 of those. What XS gains in notoriety and prestige, they lack in logistics, personality and judgment.

Upon arrival you find a confusing set of lines that took 30 minutes (Sober) to differentiate and walk from one to the other. Security is rude, not even allowing you to stand in the lobby for a minute before you are barked at. The staff inside the club is no better. 95 degree evening weather and drunken patrons warrant ice water poolside, as Drai's in Hollywood once offered me. What you find at XS  is $8 bottles of water. I'm pretty sure fire code requires a second exit in a club (expecially when booked past capacity). It took 20 minutes for us two ladies to reach the exit, and when we tried to take a short cut out security practically ripped our heads off!

This isn't Hollywood, the velvet rope doesn't part because you are beautiful or because of who you are. It's all about the Benjamins at XS. The girls wait in line and pay a cover too. But if you can't afford bottle service and you don't want to wait in line behind 100+ people at 1 a.m., use your brain and you will figure it out. Better yet if you want to check out a hot new Vegas Club on the Strip, go to Marquee.",2,2,2

First time we came here we had no problem finding it.  Second time, we had no clue where it was and asked for directions; there were no signs.  Just remember,  if you start seeing a lot of red furnishing, you are going the right way.

::Experience::
Who's the DJ?  The night we went, it was DJ Zedd.  We arrived a little before 11pm. Since we were on the guest list we got in quickly.  As we entered, I walked up the stairs and got an overview of the club ..... wow!! Music playing, lights flickering, and huge screens by the DJ stage.  Then we proceeded to the patio area. Amazing .... the pool was lightly lit, heat lamps almost everywhere, more huge screens, classy cabanas, and seating areas for the VIP tables.  In the middle of the pool is another bar and some Blackjack Tables.   Around 1am, it was crowded.  Moving around was a challenge but the staff did their best to direct the traffic.

::Customer Service::
Bartenders were quick and the drinks tasted good. The staff was not rude.  Excellent customer service from Joe who works in the front.  He was cordial and polite.  

::Highlight::
DJ Zedd's music coordinated with the lights.  As the beat bumped the lights flickered; it was like a light show. The Patio area is so stylish.  I enjoyed the music and the venue a lot!! I can't wait to come back again!! I'm totally in Love with this club!

Dance floor is a little small but that's what makes it so fun. Luckily, it opens to the pool area so it doesn't get too hot. Love being able to step outside when it gets too stuffy inside. The outside bar located near the blackjack tables is the easiest to get drinks at. 

XS isn't as strict as most places. When tables aren't reserved, you are free to sit where you want. My friends also danced on tables and didn't get yelled at. It's ALWAYS a good time a XS. So much space to roam with so many people to meet. This club has the best layout and it is really easy to navigate (no stairs, thank god).",4,1,0

The club is huge, the drinks are good, and it's the perfect photo opportunity every time I go because the pool area is so picturesque and awesome to take pictures by.  I am so glad that I go here almost every time I go to Vegas.  
The people are interesting and the crowd is more dressed up and  young and professional than the other Vegas clubs, in my opinion.  It definitely has a more classy vibe.  The dancefloor is huge and fun and they play really good music.

XS's biggest and best feature is its size.  Plus the entrance (as you approach the opening of the interior of the club) is really really impressive, especially since it opens out into the pool area and expands around it into a pennisula around the pool.  

However, I went during memorial day weekend and the place was PACKED. I've never seen it so busy there and was a bit of a turn off that it was so packed inside.  I went on sunday (not saturday, saturday was stupid crazy and the cover was ridiculous; plus we got in for free on sunday).  I think Keri Hilson was there singing her songs but she sounded so off I think the they told her to stop performing (?)

The restroom stalls here is encased from floor to near ceiling, so all you coke heads and sexual deviants out there, you can do whatever you like.

I really like the size and layout of this place. I want to compare it to Marquee's but their size and lay outs are nice in their own way. I like how the bar surrounds the pool and the ""dance floor"" and stage area are on the other end of the place. Also love the gogo dancers there! Minus their face, they're pretty hot. And they're super nice and friendly.

Great looking crowd as well! No shortage of hotties. But then again it was a Saturday evening. Everyone wanted to be here. The music was decent: I forgot who was playing but it was house music. 

Only thing I didn't like (which a lot of people would agree with me on) is the huge effing line up. We thought we were lined up for one of their long ass lines and it turned out to be the line up for VIP people or people with tables or something. When they told us where the regular line up was, it was at least 3x as long so we had to wait about an hour to get in, even with our G-List. Oh another thing I didn't like: the dance floor up at the front. I've been to some packed places in my life but that dance floor takes the bloody cake. It was so packed it was just hard to breathe. Couldn't stay there for more than 10 mins. We had to take breaks because it was quite unbearable. 

Didn't pay the full amount to get in though, so I guess the G-List had some sort of use.

Its setup is still the most desirable on the Strip, but the place just keeps getting more and more packed. It's like the club owners decided to forgo the whole exclusive club experience in favor of generating more revenue, which is a shame because the space is gorgeous and its potential is high.

I went last weekend and XS was packed to the brim with young partygoers excited (read: inebriated out of their minds) to see Zedd. Sadly, no one was really enjoying the music or dancing; they were shoving their way around crowded walkways and tables. 

Access to the outdoor patio was also restricted -- apparently, they are blocking off indoor-outdoor movement for some reason.

Based on my experiences and the many friends I have who do still live and party like tourists, it's almost unanimous that they would prefer XS over some of the newer and perhaps nicer nightclubs out there including Hakkasan, Omnia and Marquee. XS in Vegas standards, looks pretty old actually. The decor is starting to age and it's definitely far away from the video walk ways and big ol' spaceship light thingy from Omnia. Although it has an amazing lineup of DJs, you can make a case that Hakkasan (and Hakkasan Group) has the creme de la creme for superstar DJs. 

But the reason why my friends and I will continue to randomly text each other ""XS tonight?!"" every Sunday for Nightswim or Monday for Industry Night is just the ease of being able to get in touch with the promoters and their usually standard admission policies. A bunch of places change but consistency is key so we can prepare for the nights we can walk right in or night where we may have to pay a cover.

The only downside is the dance floor is super small...but luckily that's where the spacious outdoors come into play...because you can enjoy the music from every spot. The sound system is great.

Table service is great too..they have private cabanas if you don't wanna be invaded by drunk passer-bys.

To me, XS is more of a music venue than a dance club now.  Seems like every weekend they feature some house DJ, which is fine but it makes the dance floor more like a concert floor.  The bigger the DJ name, the more crowded the floor gets, making it a lot more difficult to dance.

""Sunday Night Swim"" - in the summer you can wear your bathing suit to the club and swim in the pool.  Expect house music and a smaller crowd.  During the summer, they close the inside dance floor, so everything is outdoors.  I would definitely recommend wearing a bathing suit under your club attire if you choose to go to XS for Sunday Night Swim.  They throw little inner tubes into the pool so you can float around - pretty fun.

Other nights, even without a big EDM headliner, XS is still mostly house music with maybe an hour max of hip-hop and top-40 later in the evening.  The atmosphere is definitely still fun and lively, but the homogeneity of the music just doesn't make me want to dance all night.  Marquee gets a lot of EDM headliners too, but at least they have multiple dance floors with different music.  XS is not so much a dance club for me anymore, but more of a place to hang out with friends, drink, gamble, and maybe splash around in the pool.  I used to be able to stay at XS past 4am in the morning, but lately I find myself leaving by 2am.  I still always have a good time, but it's just a different experience.

(Side note: I must say though, the music is poppin whenever they have celebrity guests, such as a rapper or hip-hop artist, visiting.)

Cons:
Drinks are pretty weak here ): I had several on my 21st and most of the buzz I felt was definitely from alcohol I had before coming in.
The Sunday resident DJ. We decided to pay a visit to XS again Sunday night, staying close to the room since we had a 6am flight Monday morning. The Sunday resident DJ was awful.

Along the perimeter of the stadium-like venue are well-staffed bars and gold-lamme sunken-relief sculptures of women's silhouettes giving the feel of a modern day colloseum where 'gladiators' battle each other not with swords & stones, but with which pole-dancing-guest can get the most attention & praise or which table's party can be most XS-ive...

The opulent gold-theme is well executed throughout the venue from the sculptures to the furnishings all the way down to the gold straws in your drink.

In the land of Vegas clubs, glitz and glam, XS is like a warm security blanket, that best friend who always has your back--loyal and consistently there, but never ceases to surprise and amaze you from time to time. 

The girls and I were in Vegas this past weekend. We went to XS on Friday night and had a blast as expected. Saturday, we decided to venture away from Wynn\/Encore to (re)try Marquee and it was regrettably the worse decision of the weekend.

Without detracting from this positive review of XS, I'll omit the grizzly details of Marquee that make me cringe & shake with disgust and irritation. 

All that needs to be known is that we came back to XS for the Sunday night swim and it was like an episode from a 90's teen sitcom where protagonist ditches bff to hang with the cool kids, only to realize that the cool kids were just a bunch of dbags.

This was our first time going out on a Sunday in Vegas and we didn't know what to expect. After Saturday at the Marquee however, we figured it couldn't get much worse. 

Bit the bullet and showed up around 11, easy peasy entry bc a promoter had approached us earlier. Best decision ever. XS Night Swim was just as incredible as any of the other nights, if not more. We come from the land of Seattle where everything closes by 1:30am on weekends, and Sundays are desolate, cold and empty. Though we were not expecting crickets, we didn't think we would be blown away either. Sunday was amazing--the beauty, spaciousness, great staff and incredible atmosphere was still there, but add water and probably slightly less people, and everything about it was perfect. 

XS redeemed a trip that could have ended on a really sour and ugly note for us. True, the interior of the club smelled of puke at first, but I'm sure that it was the remnants of an equally awesome Saturday night :P We always spend 100% of our time in the outdoor portion anyway.

In the end, I got back to the hotel at 6am, slept for 45 minutes, missed my shuttle to the airport, hopped a taxi, stumbled through airport security and the naked box, and proceeded to pass out on the plane until it landed in Seattle. 

Clearly an indication of an epic night!",2,3,2

Yes, it's the club that everyone wants to see and be seen at.

But I loved it for other reasons...
- It's gorgeous and huge, complete with an enormous dance floor, a beautiful outside area that has a pool with a bar in the center and yes, even stripper poles surrounding the VIP tables.
- Ladies, you can dip your tired tootsies into the pool but don't even think about jumping in.
- The music was pretty amenable to all, starting with classics earlier in the night (gotta love Journey when you're drunk), then standard hip-hop \/ pop fare (Lady Gaga rules all still), and finally house music at the end of the night.  The DJ even through in some Kings of Leon and Chili Peppers earlier on.
- Now, this may seem like a silly thing to note, but outside, there are ledges everywhere, which you can sit on!  I don't know about you, but after 3 hours in 4 inch stilettos, my feet feel like they're gonna fall off.  And the fact that you can sit down without having to be at a table is just lovely.

Some things to know before you go...
- There is a guest list, but it's only for parties with all girls and it's only for Sundays and Mondays.
- Cover is $30 for guys and $20 for gals.
- Get there early (like 10:00) because the line gets HUUUUGE.  But overall, the wait's not too bad.
- The line itself is pretty organized, with bottle service guests to the left of the club's entrance and general admission to the right.
- The drinks are mad expensive: $17 for an Adios.  So I'd recommend pregaming elsewhere.
- If you walk through Encore earlier in the night, you can happen upon a promoter who can give you passes for free admission.

I mean even going to the bathroom is a journey itself. We once had bottle service at the little bungalow at the second floor by the pool and I really liked it over there. It was FAR away from all the crowd and more intimate where you can just talk to friends. Bottle service is always crazy expensive, but when you know the right people it's not that bad. But drinks here are expensive. I remembered buying two cocktails and I paid like $35 for both. EEk! But typical Vegas prices. 

Dancing in the pool is really cool, well so you can rest you sore feet from your painful heels, but just don't jump in because you will get kicked out. Just go to the nights where they do let you swim in the pool. This place is definitely the spot to hang out when your in Vegas.",2,1,2

That is what happens when your bouncers attack my personality for being overly drunk. This is Vegas, baby. Everyone is drunk and that's how I act on a normal day. Just ask anyone who has ever met me. You asked me to sober up. I did. I came back, but this time I was turned away because I didn't look like my California State Identification. Even though I had my University student ID from UCSD and business cards with my photo on it. Even though I had two credit cards under that same special little name, Anni without an E. I even used one of those credit cards to buy 5 tickets to see Avicii. 3 of those tickets were for international students that I have never met before this Vegas trip just because I wanted to show them a great time in America. Instead you turned me away because I looked young. Gratefully, I can turn 25 this year. This means that I am actually no where under the legal age of drinking. And here is where I will pull that card: Racism. Honestly, this would not happen if I were someone you are used to looking at, a Caucasian 25 year old woman.

I pleaded for my new friends to leave me behind, but they didn't. At this pointed I was determine to get us in so that I could salvage the night. I took off all that beautiful make up. I watered down my hair to make it that darker shade. I took off my eyelashes (you know sh*t gets real when a girl has to take off her eyelashes. Probably not the best time to make a joke, but that's just who I am). I even considered taking off my prescription colored contact lenses to match those pure black eyes instead of dark brown. Worst thing of all, I had to put on someone else's glasses just to match the ones on my IDs. Yes. I Asianed-up for you. Your bouncers asked me to smile for them so I gave them the best smiles in the world. Finally after 3 hours, my friends and I were let in right when Avicii started to play. That was the point I didn't want to live anymore. I stood there in a sea of people thinking to myself, did I seriously just do that? Yes I did. I violated every part of myself just to get into a stupid club. Imagine an article that reads, ""Girl kills herself because she couldn't get in a club"", how funny would that be. No, I didn't want to die because I couldn't get in. I wanted to kill myself because I physically cannot stand that kind of injustices in our society. You broke me. You have made me feel tremendously helpless and furious. Here I am, a paying American citizen with legal documents and you refused me because I looked underage and you made up a BS reason for not letting me in.

Thank you for showing my new friends something only they can experience in America. Extreme racism. You are lucky because this could've been my suicide note if it wasn't for my friends who stopped me.

TLDR: I would kindly like a refund as your establishment do not deserve anything from me.

Edit: Someone asked me a funny question. He asked if I had stayed for Avicii. I guess I did leave that part open ended. I did not stay. Let me paint a word picture of how I felt. I was breaking down in the line as the security forced me to smile for them multiple times trying to prove my identity to some strange men. Then they passed my ID card back and forth between each other and whispering, ""no this isn't her"". I was pissed off and I wanted to defend myself. I'm not the kind of girl to shut up when I get attacked. But I understood the situation. These men had all the power. I had to be a quiet little Asian girl because that's what they expected of me. They thought I was drunk because they couldn't imagine me having this ability to speak up without being intoxicated. So I became submissive and stood there smiling while my male friends defended my honor. Yes. I got in eventually. But the cost was too high. The fee of admission was my identity as a woman, as an Asian, and as a general human being. That was when I decided to flee my group of friends to go die. I was actually pretty happy in those moments. I was finally able to be myself. I took off my 6 inch heels and ran off. For the first time that night I smiled for real. So, no Avicii for me.",10,0,1

There are tons of fans though so we never felt too hot (even though it was still 90 degrees).  We're cheap girls (no table service for us!!) but there are tons of places to sit outside.  

The clientele here is definitely a step above the other clubs in Vegas (we went to Chateau the night before).

We clubbed hopped and ended the night here. In order for us to get into XS we first had to go to Tryst to get a stamp because they weren't having a guest list at XS. We got here and waited in line. There were like 5 check points within the line and we had to get our IDs checked at every single one and get stamped, do they not trust one person to check IDs?

My friends definitely wanted to go to XS because Afrojack was playing. I wanted to go because my sister said it was a nice club. 

We got into the club and it was SUPER packed. It was so hard to move. I was so irritated because the people that were there that night were so fucken immature. my friends and I were standing in a crowd and then people rush on over to the section we were at and start jumping, screaming, and pushing to get to the front. While they're doing that, you got the security in front of the crowd pushing EVERYONE back. I'm stuck in the middle being pushed forward then being pushed back -______-

All the other clubs we went too gave us free drinks, XS didn't.

My buzz was killed from all those people who were pushing especially this little asian girl. I'm asian and the asians that act and look like her make me not want to be asian, they make me embarrassed. 

We didn't even get to go outside to check out the pool. I'm going to give this club another try when I am back in town. Hopefully it isn't as crowded and has classier people.",3,5,1

You know, being the first time, my friends told me glorified stories of the nightclubs in Vegas if you go VIP bottle service. ~$500 per person, get a table, get the bottles, they give you a wristband, and the girls come flocking to you. Well, it's true, to an extent, but after the night I felt I was ripped off outta my ass. So, where do we begin...

First of all, no wristband, just a stamp. And what the fuck, a pineapple? Well we're in for a nice ass fucking with this shit. 

So we went and ordered bottle vip service. Total cost of the drinks + tax + tips on the bill ITSELF totaled to almost... well you can imagine. Oh I loved this, the host never came to bring us to our table, and had the waitress do it instead. No, seriously, I do love this, because I don't have to tip her the $100 for showing us the table, unlike what we did during our stay at Marquee. 

Seriously, I cannot stress enough about never to trust the waitresses or the waiters in Vegas. The waitress will pour the shit out of the alcohol for you, then as soon as you put your cup down, the waiter will immediately swoop in and ""clean"" your cups. Each time they clean my shit, it costs us around $40 worth of alcohol that we didn't finish. Even if we put a napkin on top of it, they still take it. This ""cleaning service"" is more expensive than getting an Asian massage, I swear the god. So anyway, first time she offered, I was naive and said sure, give me some goose and sprite. Holy shit, she poured half the cup filled with goose. I took one sip, this shit was stronger than a AMF. So yeah, like I mentioned, I putted it down,  within 1 minute, the waiter came and took it away to give us the new cups. So when the waitress later returned, I said ""No, I'll pour it myself."" She gave me like an angry look or something, man, come on bitch, I'm starting to realize we're tipping these big titted sluts $400 so they would LEAVE US ALONE, not to come and pour us drinks. Get the FUCK outta here! Oh by the way, the shot cups they give us are double shots. And they refuse to give us that pouring tip thing that you can fit on bottles to prevent spills. More ways to eat up our money. 

The bouncers here were friendlier than the ones at Marquee. For one, my friend left to go Surrender and couldn't come back in. I went to the entrance to meet him, and the bouncer happened to recognize me, and after showing him my lovely pineapple pimp stamp, he let us back in. So much better than fucking Marquee.  

I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm going to have to give them dibs for putting some kinda weird shit in the urinal. Seriously, whatever this is, it ""absorbs"" the piss to prevent much noise (not that you can hear that shit in a club anyways) and prevents the splishy splashy. Man, it was like a silencer being fitted into my cock. I was blasting away without having to care less about anyone hearing it. Oh awkward moments - they have people in the room offering you cologne or to wipe your hands for hopes of tips. I politely turned them down and proceeded to wash my hands. This guy puts his hand in front of the sensor so the water would come down for me as a ""convenience."" Okay? No offense dumbass, but when I stick my hand under the facet to wash it, then sensor can still sense my god damn hands, I don't need you to stick your hands there so close to mine. You wanna hold it? I'm surprised you guys aren't offering to shake it clean for me then. 

What really brought my cum to a boil is when towards the end we had half a bottle of goose left, and the waiter came and took away our chasers and bucket of ice. Okay, what the fuck? We still have a fucking goose left, and if we ""price"" it towards your standard, that's equal to around $250 left of drinks on our table. But yes, I guess that means shit when each table costs at least $2.5k. It's okay though I guess, funnier to drink with the girls without the chaser haha. But still, it was a bitch thing to do. 

This place is smaller than Marquee. For one, it's only one floor. No need for some shittyass steel in case of emergency exit staircase. Once you get out, it's still the luxury of the hotel, which is nice I guess. But luxury comes with anal-ness - there were chairs in the hallway but the security guards wouldn't let us sit on the chairs. What the fuck? 

All in all, I had a better time at this place, but after sobering up, reality then bites me in the dick and tells me it is not worth it to spend $500+ per night on this shit. There's so many cheaper alternatives than this - a sexy massage, a sexy escort, even fucking rhino, but I guess if you want to piss with a silencer stuck on your unit, then this is the place to go.",1,10,2

Very diverse and mixed crowd. The dance floor does get super packed. But there's enough room to roam around outside. For the most part people here are pretty friendly. Music ranges from top-40, to Hip-Hop, and the rave UNCE UNCE UNCE UNCE music kicks in around midnight.

I wanted to check out this club with a group I was with for the weekend. I legitimately wanted to like this place and had a great time at Hakkasan the night before. I decided to go see Guetta on a Friday night.

The aesthetics of the club are great. The concept of having half of this nightclub outside is innovative and makes this stand apart from other nightclubs on the strip. I actually really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, this club is a step well below the likes of Hakkasan and Omnia-two clubs that I liked a TON more this particular weekend than XS for many reasons.

First, the cons. Dance floor inside the club is extremely small. It's a lot smaller than Hakkasan and Omnia. Once it gets packed, you're forced with a decision to leave and not be able to see the act up close and personal, or make a trek outside for fresh air if you don't have a table. That's how crowded it gets inside this place.

They have security barring traffic from entering inside and outside at all times which is annoying. There are also so many tables-too many in my opinion. They should rid the venue of a few tables to clear the way for a bigger dance floor. This club also can't pull the same quality DJ roster that EDM fans practically go to clubs for-I feel this place is marketed to people who hate Hakkasan and Omnia, yet this just wasn't for me. 

Now for a few pros: there is ample space surrounding the outside of the dance floor to hang out before 1, drinks are a little bit cheaper here compared to Omnia and Hakkasan. EBC looks like it would be amazing during the day. I would consider coming back, but ONLY if I had a table.",2,0,2

Considering it was a Sunday night, it was still pretty crowded.  They ended up having to open the doors to the pool to just let the air circulate.  We went from around midnight to 3am.  Around 2:30 the crowds were dying which was great cause then there was room to dance!

Cover charge:
We just completed the Las Vegas Rock 'N Roll Half Marathon (yes...I'm a finisher) and in our bags we got free passes for the club.  There were 3 runners in our group, but our party was a total of 9.  I think normally it's around $30 a person.  Our luck, those people on the street trying to give you club passes are actually legit.  We got 6 more passes for $15, so all of us got in for $15.

Interior:
When you enter through the revolving door, you have the coat check to the left and then a set of stairs which then lead you to the club.  The center of the club is the dance floor.  Pretty big if you ask me.  Around the floor are lounge seating areas.  When we got there, we couldn't find a place to sit since all of the areas were reserved.  *mental note* Reserver seats next time.  All around are Poles where girls and boys can go and dance around them.  There is a designated Pole area which you can go and be the stripper you always wanted to be.  The bars are located on the left and right of the dance floors.  Drinks are around $14 each so if you're going to plan on getting drinks at the club, make sure you bring your card or lots and lots of cash.  The dance floor was really crowded. I had to stop a few times just to get some oxygen and catch my breath.  Good thing they did open the doors.

Music:
It's like they raided my music collection.  The only thing they didn't play was Miley Cyrus and Iyaz, but heck all the other songs were awesome.  They played Black Eyed Peas, Lady Gaga, Jay Sean, David Guetta, etc.  So if you're into that type of music (pretty much top 40 dance), then you hit the right club.

Bathrooms:
The bathrooms are located on the right side (as you're entering the club).  Now these bathrooms...they were gorgeous and best thing was that after you wash your hands, someone hands you a towel.  They also have lotion available.

Ratio of girl to guy, I couldn't tell cause in our party we had 3 girls and 6 guys so that's already two guys to a girl.  I had to pay for 3 drinks (one for myself and two for my other two guy pals).  Then got two more due to winning a bet.  No one apparently hit on me which was something I was looking forward to, but my guy friends were saying how some guys were looking at me, but of course, I had like 2-3 guys already dancing with me so....yeah.  Overall an awesome clubbing experience.  I will definitely go next year after my half marathon again.",3,1,2

I went w\/ my boyfriend on a Saturday night and was a little worried about the line b\/c I'd heard this was the hottest club with the most outrageous lines and I typically go to Vegas w\/ my girlfriends and we always skip the lines. We got in line at 9:15pm (early, I know but so worth it) with drinks in hand and were in at 10pm. Not bad considering the line spilled into a nearby show theater. We hadn't even finished all the drinking we wanted to do. Everyone that works there was super nice - we were even allowed to party in a VIP cabana (that we had not booked and didn't pay for) for a good hour until the party that had reserved it showed up.

Drinks were pricey - a mini bottle of water was $8 and a well shot of Vodka was $12...but it's that way everywhere in Vegas.

If you're in Vegas don't go anywhere else and don't let line rumors keep you away. This place is HUGE, it's awesome, and it's worth an hour wait in line. Just go early and drink while you wait...the line will go much faster than you think.",0,0,0

There's still a lot of hype over this place and it is all well deserved. I applaud the designers and architects of this venue because it's a dream club come true.

I don't often go to Vegas but when I do, I visit XS. I've been here four times on 3 separate trips (twice on my most recent vacation). Each trip was with a different group of friends and each group raved about how great this place is!

With a winning combination of luxury and music, XS attracts a diversely hot and popular crowd. But the best part of this venue is the layout, which is extremely spacious. There's no walking up multiple stairwells to gain re-entry or losing your friends in a maze-like club with darkly lit areas. While some of the club is inside, most of it is outside under the starry night sky. Everything is on one level, except for the second floor cabanas which have a nice balcony view overlooking the party.

Even when XS is packed on Fridays and Saturdays, the club still has a lot of room for people to socialize, gamble, dance and move around. There's a shallow spot in the pool that reaches a little above your ankles. That's the popular area for the girls to dance at. I'm sure it's also soothing to their feet after walking in high heels so much.

Sunday nights are awesome because they open up the pool as well. The stage faces the pool and you can party while getting your nightly swim on. The nice thing is you don't have to go swimming, it's just an option. You can either show up in your bathing suit or your dressed up attire. Sunday nights are definitely more chill but they're still able to draw a nice crowd.

If you have to visit one club in Vegas, go with XS.",4,0,2

The lines are long and you have to be willing to wait. Especially when in a group of girls and guys. But it's well worth the time and money.

It's in Encore, the nicest hotel on the strip. So while we were waiting to get it, it was a nice environment with good backgrounds so great photo opportunities lol

HUGE nightclub with the outside patio\/pool area that doubles as another dancefloor. The dancefloor is really crowded and packed so our group stayed in the patio the entire time. We got a cabana outside so we had tons of room to sit and lay and take it ALL in. 

Danced in the pool for a bit. Loved that! 

We moved inside to the dancefloor when the outside closed at 4am. The inside stays open till 5am. It was nice and cold inside so dancing great!

Anyone who is going to Vegas for their first time needs to go to this club. I have only been to Vegas twice and though I have not been to a wide variety of clubs, I know what I like and agree with what everyone else has to say! Sad to say that they close off the pool area once fall hits and definitely hinders the experience. But since I came around spring break the cabanas were cracking and the pool was so pretty. I love how XS welcomes you to put your feet in and lounge around the pool. This was greatly appreciated after going to surrender last night, where they constantly yelled at you for even touching the water.

Inside: BEAUTIFUL decor, BEAUTIFUL lighting. I love the rich colors and gold.

It can definitely get a bit crowded in there, but it was fun to dance on the actual dance floor before heading outside. The bar was busy of course, but drinks were actually pretty strong for a club.

Outside: The best part of this club. My girls and I were feet first in the pool in our hot dresses, dancing together with no one bugging us or poking their wieners at us. Yay for no weiner poking! Literally inside one of my friends had an awkward encounter with a boner. Overeager much?

We came here on a Sunday night of Columbus Day weekend and this place knows how to the party! We received front of the line, no cover, VIP admission via our hotel's concierge. I honestly expected it not to pan out smoothly but it did. My gay bff, gal pal, and I approached the podium stated our guest list and my name, were given a piece a paper and ahead of the line and through the door we go in less than a minute total! I most certainly don't pay covers to go to straight establishments even if they are the ""hottest"" in Vegas, huh! :-)

Upon entrance, and it is quite a grand entrance, we got the lay of the land. Ample VIP table space with tables and couches (with tons of available tables-it was Sunday night) surrounding the sunken dance floor area which, as others have said, opens out onto a sic pool area. Female go-go dancers were doing their thing to the music on either side of the dancefloor. I must say I was a bit underwhelmed with the size of the dancefloor, was expecting it to be bigger but the music certainly made up for it. The DJ spun nicely mixed top 40, hip hop, and dance music and there was no shame on the dance floor. 

I give the bartenders an B+ for service only because it was so annoying to have to go to the same bartender to order a drink on my tab, don't think I'm used to that in DC. I paid $9 for a pretty decent Stoli Razz and tonic which I found totally acceptable and actually on par with DC nightclubs.

As for the clientele it was very mixed (mostly white 20's then some black, asian, gays, some middle-aged business type folks, and the women who accompany them, in the VIP areas) and everyone seemed to be pretty much accepted. Most importantly the douchebaggery quotient was surprisingly LOW everyone seemed to be having a great time and not giving a damn about anyone else.

So once the whole crowd in line is allowed in, good luck trying to find a spot to dance on the dance floor. Great DJ guests however. So I guess that makes up for it. 
Unfortunately, I lost my cell phone there. Worse part of it, it was stolen by an employee who refused to turn it into Lost & Found [then again, who'd turn in an iPhone 4, right?]. Had to make police report and internal report with hotel security who told me ""you waive your rights and liability once you leave the club so nothing can be done now."" [gee, thanks, XS.

So far, the idiot who stole my phone hasn't gotten the point that it has a tracking software on it. Went from being pinned during after hours at XS to a neighborhood in Las Vegas. Now Im waiting for next location to be pinned to report back to LVPD.

First off, the place is amazing.  Half indoor club, half outside dancefloor\/lounge area.  I was completely blown away by the decor.  We had no problem getting in via the VIP line and even got our cover comped (we're that special) by my smooth-talking companion.   There was an even mix of people - including some people my parents age who were tearing up the dance floor.

Tip:  If you are staying at Encore, purchase your tickets through the concierge.  Maximum 5 tickets.  You will go straight in with your tickets.  Others, you will be waiting in line.

I went there to see Afrojack last Saturday and it was simply amazing. The decor is beautiful, the layout makes sense, the acoustics are good...there is even an outdoor section, which was great even though the pool wasn't open yet. 

My few notes are this:
-If you are going with a group, I would recommend getting bottle service or getting there post-10PM. We went with a group of 16 (6 men, 10 women); the men bought bottle service so they bypassed the general admission line. The rest of us had to wait in line, but because there were 10 women, we were able to cut ahead of the line pretty quickly (which was great because the line was INTENSELY long). We still had to pay $40 per person, but the cost varies depending on who is playing.
-Another benefit to getting bottle service is that you are not stuck in the extremely crowded dance floor and you have a home plate. Otherwise, this club would have been a bit more difficult to manage, I think.
-The bathrooms are AMAZING! Seriously, I'm not kidding. Never had to wait in line, and there is a massive array of perfumes\/hairspray, etc. Totally awesome.

As for what type of bottle service to get, we had one of the cheapest tables inside and, in my opinion, had one of the best seats in the house. We were right next to the left-hand bar (there are bars on both side of the dance floor) which placed us in the back of the room, but there are ledges that you can stand on, which is great for when the DJ comes on! We debated getting a table outside, which was a bit more expensive. During the summer, that might have been an OK option, but it is also a bit far away from the dance floor. In fact, from what I could tell, they played different music entirely. However, for the summer when the pool is open, it might have been a fun place to party. 

Also, for being a Vegas club, drinks were pretty cheap around $12. I can't wait to go back!!",3,0,1

XS is a nice club but I had one of the worst experiences getting in. Dealing with security\/bouncers who were straight up rude and disrespectful. Killing the Vegas vibe. They need to get off their high horse quit being a**holes to patrons who are coming into the club that are PAYING THEM. YOU ARE NOT A PART OF THE TSA or the FBI. Mind you, I came here with a couple of girls who are all from PA and we were a bridal party. All my friends got through and I was the last one of the group to get my ID checked. I was friendly to the security and showed them my ID. He was investigating that thing for a long time and was squinting his eyes - like, seriously??? I get that he's doing his job but then he didn't have to be a d**k. He grabs 3 other guys to 'check' my ID. Asked me questions about my ID - which I ANSWERED ALL CORRECTLY but they still give me a hard time - mind you, the line was long and people behind me were waiting! It was embarrassing - the way they handled the situation. After I see them whispering in each others ears and scanning me and my ID for a couple of minutes. I FINALLY get a stamp on my hand from some girl. I muttered under my breath of how annoyed and disrespected I felt. This girl has the nerve to say crap to my face that they are just doing their job and that If I'm going to give an attitude I should leave... I was so furious at her attitude and wanted to slap her but obvs - that is not happening here. So I hold my anger and get through into this overpriced club. Killed my mood here in Vegas. YOU guys are doing a terrible job. Treat your guests with some respect. Get an ID scanner. In fact, get some eyewear cause it seems like you can't check ID's correctly and are just nasty.

They're supposedly under construction so the outdoor area wasn't open, but that just made the indoor area seem more lively.  I went with two buddies and we pre-purchased tickets online for ~$38, knowing about our gender disadvantage.  Arrived at about 10:45 and got in a little less than an hour later.  Definitely helps to have a promoter but it seemed that they were just letting groups with girls in as long as their ratios were 1:1 or better.  

The last time I went to XS they had only opened a small portion of the outdoor area, basically just some of the tables outside behind where the DJ was.  Even this area was closed off this time around.  I'm not sure how accurate I am about this, but it seemed even that Surrender is having larger crowds than XS nowadays.  I know one reason why sections of clubs are closed off is because they don't expect as much people but they still want to make the club seem crowded.  Whether or not this was the reason this past weekend I'm not sure.

Anyway I really like the vibe of XS.  The music was awesome after Sultan and Ned Shepard came on.  Before that at around 11:30-12:30 it was pretty good too, but you could kind of tell the DJ was asked either to withhold from playing certain songs or to lame it down a little before Sultan and Ned Shepard.  Either way when they came on at 1:00 AM everyone had a really good time.  

Drinks are more expensive here than at TAO, which I went to on Friday night.  Hennessy and OJ (which was my drink of the weekend) was running at $15 at TAO and $17 at XS.  Not that big of a difference, but it does start racking up.

There wasn't much of a line for the men's bathroom both times that I visited.  

XS will still remain on my list of recommendable clubs, even with new contenders like Hakkassan and Light.  In the end it's more important who's performing, what kind of music you like, and who you're with.  For me, XS on 11\/30 was all I could ask for.

tl;dr - yes.",1,0,1

It's too bad that the dance floor area is small and gets packed fairly quickly. At least it opens up to an outdoor patio and pool area where you can order drinks and hang out. The patio also gives you nice views of the Wynn hotel. The layout of the entire club as well as the interior design is very posh. I purchased a shot from a cocktail waitress, and it tastes great too. They also have chairs in the patio area where you can sit down. The indoor area is tiny, but at least the outdoor area is very spacious and you don't have to worry about it getting too crowded outdoors.

My first time was a drag, considering the guestlist I was on was only for the patio (I think most guestlists are like this for XS) which was crowded and no one really wanted to dance. I left shortly after I got my free watery vodka+soda.

Fast forward to Independence Day! I love Kaskade, and had missed him at EDC, so I bought tickets for his show on the 4th. We got there at 11, and the ticket line was really short. I only waited 10 minutes. This club would be 100x better if it were bigger. Kaskade put on an amazing show, and really got the crowd going, but you can't dance! The dancefloor is super small, and people really love squeezing into that 1 foot space in front of you. So if you go to clubs to dance, this probably won't be a good place unless you're dying to see any of their regular big name DJs.

I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.

This crowd was the best looking and youngest I've seen yet.  It seemed like the bouncers were selective when letting people in.  The layout makes sense, it's refreshing, it's beautiful.  It has an amazing presentation when you walk in.  The bathrooms were never crowded.  I guess the only downside was somewhere around midnight it got ridiculous crowded to move around.  But on the dance floor I was fine... it was just an adventure trying to relocate. 

But... I can see why it was crowded!  Gosh, the DJ knew how to mix.  It seemed to me that it was 50\/50, house and top 40.  Gotta love it.  It was such a good vibe in there... everyone was having a blast.  Everyone was so friendly... man, what a great night.

The line wrapped around buy my goodness, it was the shortest wait I've ever experienced. Honestly, probably 5 min, 10 minutes wait at the most. Also, unlike Tryst, the bouncers were cute AND friendly!! I flagged down the first guy I saw and he couldn't be nicer... ""Hi sweetheart, what can I do?"" LOL, I about melted!! Told him I was on the guestlist... and oh btw, 1 extra guy that wasn't on the list originally. He said ok, and gave me the pass, told us to have our ID's out and we ALL got in for free. Went down to the next bouncer where he checked our ID's and stamped our hands... also friendly and cute (not as cute as the first guy, but cute)... walked to the next bouncer and he checked our ID's again...he took my hand, gave me a weird look, and started laughing. ""Huh? Why do you have a stamp already?"" I was like that guy checked our ID's and stamped it. Oh he said, then you didn't need to come to me... but would like you another stamp anyways? Sure I said. LOL. So he laughed and stamped us all again and told us to have fun. I love the bouncers here. We were walked in by another bouncer, also hot and friendly.

Stepped into the club and the entrance is gold. Gold on the walls, on the ceilings, gold body statues... just beautiful. Keep walking up the stairs and down to the club... overlooking the pool!! We walked around to check out the rest of the club... there's cabanas on the lower and upper level. We go up to the upper level to see the whole place.

Ordering a drink here is not easy... image, this place is 40,000 sq ft, and the place was PACKED!!!! That is a lot of people!! There are also tables for gambling too... the limits are on the higher end, but from what I know, you get free drinks when you gamble... so it might be worth checking out. The dance floor I must say is very small compared to the rest of the club. Personally I loved staying by the pool. Lots of Asians at this club... but there are other ethnics too.

Anyways, a pool in a club where you can actually go into... BEST idea ever!! I have never seen so many good looking guys w their shirts off. Oh how I wanted to jump into the pool... but I didn't have a bathing suit on underneath. I should have anyways. It apparently didn't stop many guys who decided to just go ahead and jump in w their boxers or the boxer-briefs (HOT!!!) Also, soaking your feet into the pool after the 3rd night of clubbing in 5 inch heels feels incredible AMAZING!!! The drinks here are good too... didn't taste hard but sure packed a punch afterwards... or maybe bc it was the 3rd night in a row? LOL.

Anyways, 4th July at XS was soo much fun!! I bought novelty items for the trip, so we had 4th July headgear and leis... it got some fun attention, LOL. Lots of high-5's from people and drunk guys asking like 5 times, whose b-day it is. Another thing I liked was that the guys here were actually very nice and decent. They just wanted to have fun and didn't try to get you to ""hang out after"". Some of the guys in the pool were slightly shy, which I thought was adorable. There were beach balls to throw around and everyone was just friendly and having fun, no pressure!

This club most def deserved 5 stars!! If I could give more, I would!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this club and will be going here again on the next Vegas trip for sure!!
 
A+++ for this club: 
- cute and friendly bouncers
- pool you can actually go into
- friendly and fun crowd (goes for both the girls and guys)
- 40,000 sq ft of fun!!! Plus lots of FREE seating (poolside and all around the club) 
- my promoter getting both the girls and guys in for free!!

... next time, I'll have my bathing suit ready to go... and if not, I'll still going in the pool!!",4,1,4

We (5 girls in our group) had a host walk us in, but we still waited in line for a good 10 minutes.  Perhaps I'm spoiled (I don't usually do the wait in line for a club thing) but that wait seemed pretty long.

Dance floor was crowded, but I guess that's a good thing. I don't know.  I feel like mayyyyybe I'm over the club scene and prefer the lounge scene instead.

I don't consider myself an avid clubber but IMHO, this has got to be one of the best clubs in all of Clubbing Land. They have everything a good club needs - good-sized dance floor, plenty of bottle service booths, decent booze, music that will knock out your eardrums, go-go dancers, beautiful people, gorgeous posh interior design (I loved the gilded boob embellishments), and heated outdoor booths\/extra seating to cool off throughout the night. They even have free lotion, hairspray, deo, VS body mist, candies, and attendants near the sinks that HAND you towels in the ladies room. How fancy is that?? I think the cover is totally worth it.

As for music, it is namely Hip Hop\/Top 40 - which is the best kind of music to dance to 'cause everybody knows the words. And when everyone around you is singing along to the music, you feel good. At least I do.

The bar was a fire code hazard waiting to be realized. I didn't get the chance to find out how much drinks cost because I was busy warding off a particularly unrelenting sleaze bag in line whose persistence eventually forced me to ditch the bar area altogether. Unless you have ulterior motives, I suggest getting hammered before hitting the club, or bringing a buddy, preferably male (and sturdy), to wait with you in line so you don't have to deal with the potential hassle of eager beavers.

Stuff to remember for next time:
1) Bring a coat (now that I know they have a coat check!)
2) Dance around in the pool (it was closed when I went in December - probably too cold)
3) Utilize ""designated"" stripper poles ;)
4) Beware of street peddlers claiming they can get you on the guest list for a nominal fee - the girls in our group got duped by one of 'em bastards! ;(",2,0,1

We walked in and this place is HUGE and beautiful. Drinks are pretty standard for Vegas clubs, I think about $15 for a vodka soda. The dance floor was a little too cramped and busy for me so we moved outside and danced by the pool.

Not only will you wait in line for about 2 hours (remind you people, WE do not do lines here if you are semi hot!) and get to pay a cover charge that is your monthly electricity bill (remind you tourists yet again, your house may be big in California but there is  areason why this hotel is SO MUCH bigger!) you also get to experience the rudest service in the history of rudness ever :)

A few people who left reviews before me gave a number for a promoter they used named Rachel (702-557-4160), so I decided to text her as well.  SO glad I did.  Not only did she get us into XS for free with two drink vouchers each, but she also hooked me up with awesome promoters for all the other clubs we wanted to go to.

As for the club itself: there are two areas...the outdoor pool area and the indoor club and stage area.  You get admitted into the pool area first, and then there is a huge line to get in to the dance floor.  Fortunately, one of the security guards snuck us in with a little eye batting and some bribes from a couple guys who wanted us to come in to their table, but if that hadn't happened, we never would have made it inside.

The atmosphere is pretty cool though.  I can't vouch for the price of drinks because I didn't pay a dime for anything, but I imagine they run the typical $15-$20.

One thing I will say is: LADIES, KEEP YOUR PURSES ZIPPED AND VERY CLOSE TO YOUR CHEST!!! Several girls in the club got their phones and wallets stolen right off of their bodies.  It gets ridiculously crowded on the floor, to the point of literally being squished up against people, so protect your personal belongings.

And if you need a breather head off and chill by the pool. It's like alternating sweet and savory bites.

As Nico A. stated, XS is very ""San Jose"" which I am not a fan of.

I prefer a diverse party with people of all race and culture along with music from Rock to Hip Hop but everyone looked the same and all they played was mash-ups that you here DJ Scotty Boy play in SF.

Some things I want to add:

-Go on a Friday night, it's less crowded and you will be guaranteed in with no problem at 9:30pm. Either that, or grab a stamp first then come back and skip the line!

-Drinks can be a bee-yotch to get cause of how packed it is everywhere. I was in front of my bartender for 20 min and he skipped me 3 times, even for a dude who came after me! Rude, I say.

-All the tables for gambling are all BLACKJACK, or at least the night we were there, just as a note.

-Some ladies should NOT be up on those stripper poles. Some chick full on slid herself down the pole upside down with her asscheeks hanging out. Too explicit for me! plus security pulled her off after that.

-Do bottle service, you won't regret it. Waiting in line for drinks is a buzzkill alone! We would've sprung for it but they were sold out, of course. I hear the standard is $500 for a bottle for 4, plus gratuity. Not too bad. They also have cabanas and the second level cabanas if you're feeling it.

-Thank goodness for the attendants in the bathrooms, guiding the girls to the next available stalls.. makes the line move way faster!

-We spotted Victor Drai walking around. Hard to imagine that a team of 60 yr old entrepreneurs created this club. damn!

Next time I'm in Vegas, I am definitely reserving bottle service ahead of time! Until then..",7,7,8

the bouncers are quick to react--some jerk threw my girl's purse and that guy got bounced out of there asap!

my friend and i (two hot girls) got on some promoter's VIP list so there was zero wait for us when we arrived just before 1am. i don't remember there being much of a line at that time, either. we got three free drink tickets each. we ordered three lemon drops and after downing all three, found that they were extremely weak shots because both of us are lightweights! later when some guy bought us shots, i found out it was $48 for the three shots. so fellas, be warned! lol

i loved the music they played here and the vibe in the club. we actually danced until closing at 4. such a blast! the people were all friendly, i found.

the bathroom was my fav in vegas. a ton of mirrors and lots of bodysprays etc. i don't remember actually using the bathroom, just primping in front of the mirrors.

absolutely love it here and can't wait to come back!",0,0,0

Get there early as there was a long line already formed at around 9:45pm.  However, it only took about 20 minutes to get in. Cover was free for ladies with one of the line passes you get on the strip during the day and $30 cover for men.  When you walk in the club it is similar to Tryst but once you go outside there is not another club in Vegas that come close to how nice this place is. There is a huge shallow pool right outside with beds right on the edge of the water that you can actually lounge on for free and there is lots of reserved seating all around the pool that you can reserve for a hefty fee as well.  In addition to this there are 2 levels of VIP rooms all the way around the perimeter of the outside area as well that probably cost as much as a mortgage payment but looked very nice.  The music in the club was pretty good but the music at Tryst was better the night before.  Drinks prices are typical Vegas which are way overpriced.  A margarita for my wife was $16 without tip. On this trip we went to LAX, Tryst, XS and Studio 54 and XS was by far the best because it offers a little of bit of everything.  The huge outdoor area allows you to find somewhere to sit down and get some air when you no longer feel like being cramped on the dance floor which is not really an option at other clubs in Vegas unless you are in a VIP area and many of us can't afford that.  We also saw a man who appeared to be about 80 years old dancing his ass off for about 2 hours straight with any chick who would dance with him.  Only in Vegas.....",1,0,0

I will definitely go to this club again for two main reasons, love the layout and decor, and lots of places to sit even if you have no bottle service.

I came over the summer for a pool party on Sunday night and wow, they really know how to party here. Also the promoter I was in contact with hooked it up with free admission and didn't screw me over like some promoters did  in the past! A simple and professional exchange was all it took to get us in quickly, NO BS! A lot of promoters in Vegas do not understand this concept! 

The club was crackin. The whole place was huge and really nice and the crowd was a pretty good mix. However, I could do without the house music though. I'm more of a hip hop guy. Also the drinks and buy-ins at the card tables were expensive, but hey it's Vegas! Overall it was a lot of fun and the vibe was good. Also experienced a crazy drunk white guy dancing like he was having a seizure. Funny stuff.

Just like with the Encore, everything about XS is ultra-lavish, sexy,decadent and chic. 

Entrance to the club is generally $30 for gentleman and $20 for ladies. Just like all of the other clubs in Vegas it can be significantly higher on some nights depending on what's going on it in town. For the Beyonce concert weekend, I heard they were charging upwards of $50 for guys. Be sure to adhere to their strict dress code. Fella don't even think of wearing your Js to this club unless you are Michael Jordan himself. Ladies, show of dem tig ol bitties and you're sure to get in. Try to have a higher ratio for female than males in you group to increase your odds of being let in at a decent time, otherwise to avoid the long line and guaranteed entrance bottle\/VIP service is highly recommended.

Once you walk into XS you will be in awe as you are able to see all three areas of it: the lounge, the main room, and the pool area. The decor motif is gold, brown and beige. For me the main highlight of the club is the pool area with the cabanas, beds in the water, and blackjack tables that some even swim up to.

If you're feeling like you are baller status, try their signature drink ""The Ono"" which is highlighted by Dom Perignon Enotheque champagne and Louis XIII dey Remy Martin Black Pearl cognac.

XS is not only the hottest club in Vegas right now but one of the top and most exclusive in the world. They do not need to promote the club by publicizing celebrity guest because the elite tend to just flock their. One night I bumped into Christian Rolando and Paris Hilton at different parts of the club! For me the minor things that could tweak to make XS better areif they were to stop switching their music between hip hop and dance\/house every 15 minutes towards 2-4am and if they could recruit the hot asian chicks in the bathtubs at Tao! Other than that XS is definitely the biz-ness!!!",3,1,0

Do not be afraid of the ginormous line outside of the club as the line will move quickly and you'll be in the club in no time.  

It is beautiful inside.  If you can actually focus on the decor for a minute and ignore the sudden urge to dance and drink, then you can appreciate how intricate and pretty it really is inside.  There is an obvious trendy Asian theme going on, with huge butterfly-like fans littered cross the ceiling.  Super trippy.  The booths are really nice and large if you're into the bottle service gig.  The restrooms are awesome and huge, complete with tons of bathroom stalls and mirrors to check up on your makeup or check how your butt looks in that skank-ho dress--I know I did!  Be sure to check out the patio and the pool since I've heard raving reviews about it.  I, however, was too inebriated to saunter outside and squeeze through a dance floor of hot, gyrating people.  

The music is great.  The DJ really knows how to get the crowd pumped up and won't switch to new songs every fifteen seconds. The dance floor is large, if my memory serves me correctly, but it fills up quickly after midnight.  Don't fret, there is bound to be a space for you to get your groove on the dance floor. 

The bars are super packed with people barking out orders so it  can be a daunting task trying to purchase your libations (This is when bottle service comes in handy.  Unfortunately, not all of us are baller like that.  Sad face. Sigh!).

The crowd is sexy,  beautiful people everywhere and only here!

If you are looking to be tricked into paying double for this club I recommend not to go. We waited in line for two hours and decided to leave. 

The organizers of the club who ever they are just wants their commission and how do I know this? I personally asked. He told me they don't make money from inside of the club only the bar does so they have to get their commission somehow telling people to pay twice the amount to get in. I don't knock their game but I'm not the one that will be paying double for any club when they were closing in an hour. 

The line for people who was paying regular price didn't move at all only the line for people who payed over 100 to get in!! Due to the bad experience that I had I will not plan to go back there and attempt to get in I will stick to my usual spots.",12,0,0

It's a Vegas club, so you're going to get your typical EDM music played by DJs who just press play. But it's Vegas, and every club is like that, so just let it go and have a good time dancing to the kandi kid EDM. 

It's a fun time here every time I go. The club is beautiful and the drinks are strong. We always get in on a guest list. I recommend finding a promoter so you don't have to pay the cover fee, or get a discounted rate. So even with the free drink ticket from the guest list, the drinks are ALWAYS strong. If you're paying $10+ for a drink in Vegas it's always awesome to find a place that can make them strong. 

The club is indoor and outdoor. They are both very nice. The outdoor has a pool and in the summer they do a night swim club. The back wall that goes to the outside area is completely opened, so there's plenty of fresh air going into the club constantly. It's a comfortable temperature because of it. 

If you are coming in the winter time, they do keep it open then, which makes it kind of cold sometimes, actually. But they have a coat check for $10 and they give you a tag on a bracelet so you don't lose it! I thought that was perfect. 

I've heard that Drai's is even nicer, so I can't wait to try that one out next time I'm in Vegas. Either way, I'd really recommend checking this club out if you're here. It's a fun time!",4,0,0

They have an indoor-outdoor concept with a pool outside for night swim. I highly recommend this club for a glamorous feeling. Hakkasan is really amazing too but it's dark and smokey. XS feels fresh and clear bc of the fresh air from the outside coming in. The tables are the best but expensive obviously. The dance floor is tiny but perfect right in front of the DJ and VIP stage tables so you can see celebs there. I've seen Britney Spears and some athletes hanging out. David Guetta kills it here and the chainsmokers are really cool but feels more like a concert when they are on. Good luck getting to the bathroom. I saw a girl passed out in there on the floor and it was scary. They have 0 tolerance for drugs so don't even try it. It's not like Miami nyc and la. LIV Miami is the only club comparable to the party of XS. Still LIV is the sexiest but XS can bring a decent looking crowd. The waitresses expect 25%+ so bring your wallet and get wasted if you buy a table. Good luck!,1,0,0

You have to make sure you get there as early as possible, 930, if your like me and hate waiting in a long line. I waited for about 20-30 mins to get in.

But thats not the end, if you go to the back of the club, you will realize that you are outside and there is a HUUUUUUUGE pool with a dancing area. In the center there is a bar with gambling tables. Surrounding the pool is another lounge like area with a bar. Definitely a spot I will be returning to ASAP!!
