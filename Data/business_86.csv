Our group of 4 headed there Saturday night, and were immediately charmed by the atmosphere with the cute patio seating and white lights.  We arrived at 7ish and got a drink at the bar (a plus - Nimbus beer from Tucson!  And a $5 glass of Pinot Grigio!)  before being seated outside in about 20 minutes.  

Our waiter was super friendly and helpful, suggesting the indecisive BF order half Prosciutto Crudo and half Salsiccia.  The rest of us ordered the Margherita - I know, I know, original.  More points to the waiter, who didn't look at my friend like a weirdo when she ordered her Margherita sans the cheese. Also, there was one woman who seemed assigned to water distribution only, and was on top of refilling our glasses.  And for me, that was every 5 minutes.  

We started with the Caprese Salad, which was different but oh so delicious.  The cherry tomatoes were soaked in the pesto, oregano, and olive oil and were very flavorful - great with the mozzarella.  I could've used more basil leaves or arugula, but whatev.   The pizza's were mmmmm, mmmmm good but didn't blow me away.  Again, I could've used more basil leaves, but my fellow margherita eaters took theirs off, so again, personal preference.  

I would definitely return for the overall ambience and uniqueness of Cibo, as well as the friendly staff and owners.  Definitely a downtown treat!!",2,0,1

I am an absolute pizza lover and this place made me very happy.

I read up on Cibo in a recent Phoenix Magazine article and felt it was time to check it out and expand my pizza-horizons. My man and I drove down and were in love at first sight.

The atmosphere of this place is perfection. Right up my alley. The twinkly lights and warm patio was almost as cozy looking as the inside of the old home. A delicious pizza place in a quaint bungalow in downtown Phoenix? Yes please! 

I love my wine almost as much as I love my pizza. So when I asked my server for a recommendation, she provided a sweet, flavorful glass of an Italian white wine. The wine combined with the Caprese Salad and a fresh Margherita pizza...I was in heaven. This will be a favorite of ours for quite some time to come. Thank you, Cibo!",5,1,4

I visited there with a couple work buddies for their birthday party a couple months ago. The owners were there hobnobbing with the patrons as the passed out FREE Margherita pizza and two dollar beers. Good beer too! I got a Lagunita's Little Sumpin. 

Aside from their awesome basically free birthday bash I have been several times before.

The starters are delicious and usually change with the season's (I believe). The charcuterie plate is a great way to get your night going with some red wine. It's called Il Tagliere and it really gets me going. The other starters are great too (honestly the starters are better than the pizza)

The pizza is delicious but not my favorite in the valley. They do Neapolitan style with a nice sweet dough that is a little chewy. I really can't say much about the pizza besides the fact that it is really good but i prefer the  za's at POMO, Bianco, and strangely La Grande Orange. That being said I have only tried the margherita and the fresco...

ALSO! If you happen to be there when they are serving pasta, ditch the pizza and get the pasta you will not regret it.",1,1,0

There is seating and a small bar area inside, as well as outside patio seating in the front yard. The outdoor area has white lights strung up among the trees, very cute. This all makes for a wonderful atmosphere: charming during the day and romantic at night! 

The service is also great. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgable about the menu and made some solid recommendations for us.

On to the food: The pizza is AMAZING! I think Cibo is way better than Pizzeria Bianco. The crust is thin, but it's still doughy and a little chewy. We ordered the Salciccia (tomato sauce, sausage and cheese) and the De Notte (4 cheeses, spicy salame, no sauce). The sausage tastes like it has rosemary in it and the salame is indeed quite spicy.

We drove to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl on New Years Eve and after the game had no idea where to go for dinner. Once I saw all the fantastic reviews, I decided to call to see how crazy it would be to 'walk in' for dinner. Turns out, not crazy at all! We walked the 5ish blocks from where we were staying to a cute, converted house. It was cozy, warm and welcoming. We were seated immediately at a table which overlooked a fountain in a small area of grass with lawn chairs. Service was perfect - fast enough to keep your stomach from eating itself, but not too fast that you run out of space on the table. We split an order of the calamari, T&K Salad and the Genova pizza.

We had a table near the entry walk - as the crowd built up, some of the people waiting to be seated were kind of crowding our space (I had the seat closest to the walkway).  Other than that, nice environment.  (Be prepared to walk upon arrival - we had to park a couple of blocks away - nice evening, so no worries!)

We came because I was told Cibo had the best gluten-free pizza crust.  (I tasted it, and it tasted very much like the not-gluten-free crust - not at all cracker-like as most places seem to have).

This is one of those upscale wood-fired places that has pizzas with all kinds of things you may not associate with pizza toppings (e.g. prosciutto crudo, capers, artichokes).  That's great for some folks, but when you've got a teenager with coeliac, it would be great to have simple pepperoni as an option. 

I went with the aforementioned prosciutto crudo topping for my pie.  It's added after the pizza is cooked (makes perfect sense).  However, it's also added after the pizza is cut, so you have to cut\/tear the prosciutto to fit the slices (doesn't make perfect sense).  My pizza didn't have a terrific 'upskirt' and the gumline on the crust was pretty high - I think they rushed it a bit.  My wife's crust had better leopard-spotting.

It was nice that they had crepes available for dessert, and that gluten-free crepes were available!  The crepes were a nice finish.

My iced tea only got refilled once (turned out to be a blessing, as it's a longish drive home).

Also, great 'hipster watching', if that amuses you.

I'm going to lump Cibo into the same category as Pizzeria Bianco - if that floats your boat, this probably will too.  

As for me?  Not my thing... overrated\/overpriced.",4,2,3

The atmosphere is just perfect. Our part actually sat outside, which the patio is just beautiful on a AZ October night. I didn't even feel like I was sitting in Phoenix.

These are three GOOD sized pieces of bruschetta topped with a ton of toppings. I really enjoyed the Prosciutto one. Melt in your mouth good. Then we split the De Notte pizza. It was a white pizza with spicy salami, mozzarella and tomatoes. The top of the pizza was burnt just enough to give it that perfect flavor. I don't remember the last time, if ever I had a pizza THAT good. I was a little disappointed we didn't get to try a red pizza, but we were plenty full from the appetizer and main entree. Not too full to split a nutella crepe topped with vanilla ice cream..oh yeah baby, can't go wrong with a little nutella in your mouth. That's what she said.

Service was great. Our waiter was quick, despite how busy the place was. He was very friendly and very helpful, except for telling us the brushetta was small not that I'm complaining :).

First pick for pizza was the mushrooms and the second was one with sliced Italian bacon. The pear salad added some additional sweet flavor so we ended up not even choosing a dessert to try.

The ambiance was fantastic and it was the perfect date spot for the wife and I to sit back and relax. They even had a local musician playing live music to even better the mood for dinner. Service was fantastic and every part of our dinner made the wife and I happy about our dinner choice.

Let me start by saying everything I ordered was perfect.

The ostra salad was plenty as a starter for the wife and I and it was fresh with fantastic tasting ingredients.
The diavola spicy pizza with ricotta added was the best pizza I have ever had.
My wife's white pizza was fantastic as well it had mushrooms greens and pork I believe on it
The banana creepes with Nutella and ice cream was oh so yummy.
The fresh made iced tea was also unique and fantastic.

We left with a 3 course meal for around $60 which is not bad at all for the experience and food we received

I would most defiantly recommend this restaurant to anyone.",12,3,6

Has a very urban and rustic feel with the brick, vines, and tree lightings. Request to eat outside in the evening when it is much cooler as you enjoy the sunset and live music playing in the background.

We started off with the pesto salad, which was amazing. I'm a major carnivore and prefer having meat, but this salad was quite satiating even without. 

For pizzas, we had the Procida (mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, Asian pears, chopped arugula, goat cheese and black pepper) and Salsiccia (tomato sauce, sausage and mozzarella). Pizzas crust were thick for ""thin"" crust pizza. I enjoyed the Procida most, since I love goat cheese, but would probably opt out of the pears next time. I usually prefer a very crunchy crust, but it's a bit soft here.

The menu is mostly comprised of pizzas but it offers a wide selection of both red and white sauce varieties.  There is also a decent selection of salads to accompany your meal.  Tonight I shared a salad with goat cheese strawberries and cartelized walnuts. Very delicious combination.  For dinner I had a red sauce pizza with artichokes, prosciutto and olives(whole). Quite a scrumptious flavor explosion. I didn't sample the desert menu which is made up of crepes of various flavors, although most of them entail Nutella.

Yeah, I'm a Scottsdale girl, I admit it, but I  tend to think Scottsdale is a pretty beige place a lot of the time.  Not a lot of character see?  And that is what some restaurants in Phoenix have  - character.  And I think that is one of the things I like about Cibo.  First off, it is in this weird little neighborhood in downtown Phoenix and a little hard to get to if you don't figure out the one way street thing and wind up going down a street the wrong way.  Not too good an idea.  Then there is the fact that ya kinda wonder if your car will be up on blocks when you come out because of the neighborhood.  But Cibo is in a little 1920s bungalow and absolutely charming.  Another great date place!  Shrubs with those little white Xmas lights in them all around the old brick patio, cool old trees outside and the inside is pretty vintage-y too (I made that word up).. I have never eaten inside as the weather has been so darn great everytime I have been there that the patio is where I have wound up.  Anyhoo, on to the food- I think it is great.  I was suggested that I have their white pizza and add red sauce and it was amazing.  Lotsa cheese, gooey, and you could tell that the crust was made there, not prepacked and frozen or something like that. Seriously, that is the only kind I have had there so far and I have been there about 4 x.  Pretty sad...I should try other stuff but once I find something good... 'nuf said.  Their salad with fresh figs was great too.  Add a glass (ok, a bottle) of red wine and you are set.  Oh, and I think that it is the owner who hangs by the door outside and helps with the seating, which btw I think is a great touch.  Whenever an owner cares enough to be there and watch out for the place and assist, I think that is always a good sign.  Obviously the kitchen is doing good without her being back there! :)


Only one thing that I wish they would change\/add:  different desserts?  I like Nutella but in everything?  There has gotta be something else you can do?  Buy?  Import? Just a thought....

I just wish that they would move that little house up north so that I can actually enjoy the evening without worrying about the looonggg drive back to Scottsdale..but I guess that is my problem!",3,2,2

I must admit, Cibo impressed me more than I anticipated... even after reading the 100 reviews that came before mine!

I had plans to meet my friend and future yelper Leslie F for lunch on Monday, and when she suggested Cibo since it's near where she works, I jumped on it... after all, I'd never been and I'd been wanting to try it for ages!

Maybe lunchtime is the time to go, as we didn't have to wait for a table and our service was right on... Sara was our waitress and she was just the right amount of attentive; she gave us time to peruse the menu per our request but brought our iced teas out right away.  They stayed full too... thanks to the attentive rest of the staff.  I felt like I drank about 5 gallons of tea (it's really good by the way).

I opted for a vegetariano sandwich served hot with a house salad.  The saltimbocca bread is worth breaking the wedding diet for, and the grilled zucchini, roasted red bell peppers, grilled eggplant and mozzarella are just the right amount of flavor in between the fresh bread.  Each bite was uhhhmazing.  I love when restaurants choose not to skimp on the quality or the quantity.  The salad was the perfect compliment as well.

Leslie chose the Sicilia salad.  She is a Cibo regular but this was the first time she had this particular salad.  It comes with organic mixed greens, orange slices, goat cheese, and toasted almonds with Grand Marnier dressing and a side of fresh bread.  She seemed happy with her order as well.  The other salads and sandwiches looked appealing as well.

We skipped dessert although Leslie told me that the mini crepes they serve are fabulous... I'll have to return to try those as well as the pizzas one evening for dinner.  

I know Jared will also love the bungalow style house and laid back ambiance that Cibo offers in addition to the fabulous menu and service we received.  I can't wait to share my new find with him!",15,9,14

But the sandwiches we ordered were amazing! Went for lunch. So no pizza on the menu at this time. You will have to find parking, which can be a little tough. There is a lot behind the ""restaurant"", which is really a little bungalow type house and gives it the character. I had the Salsiccia sandwich which was fesh hot and amazing! The Italian Sausage was probably the best I've ever tasted and they feature fresh baked bread in a wood burning oven.

Next, the Asian waitress we had was very impatient with our menu questions.  I thought it was just me that noticed that, but then 2 other people in my party mentioned that she was quite rude. Also, no bread was served while we waited for our meal.  I guess they only serve bread for an additional $2?

First of all, there is complimentary valet (which we did not use), but the parking lot is TINY. We ended up parking a bit away at the Salvation Army establishment. Once we walked to the entrance, we signed in (they send you a text message once your table is ready), and we were lucky enough to sit at the two chairs outside the front door. But please be aware; the waitresses carelessly kick the door open as they walk outside, and after we watched this happen over and over again, we decided it to be a danger. So if you have little ones, DO NOT let them wander by the front door. Her initial reaction to the loudness inside the restaurant was shock. Beware; the sound levels on a busy night are near-deafening. Also, the tables are situated very, very close to each other, so this is definitely not a good idea for a romantic dinner. We both ordered the pulled-pork sandwich made with fresh charbroiled buns. The pulled-pork was delicious and the buns were tough, but was okay, because we ate our sandwiches with a fork and knife. After dessert, we ordered crépes! I had the Nutella and Banana, and she had the Nutella and Mascarpone (fancy cheese). My crépe was excellent, and cost $7.50, which is worth it in my opinion. Her's cost $8.00 and was great, but she complained of not being able to taste the cheese.

Once we got inside, it made me feel like I had stumbled into the kind of place I wanna be in. Nice and clean, but totally got that old converted house feeling (in a good way). Oh, and by 12:30 when we left- packed!

The food- Yum! At our table there were two PLT's (one of them mine), basically prosciutto, lettuce & tomato, a pastrami sandwich and another sammy that I cannot recall. What I can recall is that everyone liked them- me especially. It was great... perfectly toasted bread, great fillings and a nice little salad. And for desert since my lady companions insisted- a crepe suzette and a crepe with nutella. And of course- damn!

The price- Bout $60 for all 4 of us. I would have spent that easily at some place that I would not have been half as happy with.

Indoor seating is nice if you want that homey downtown vibe, as it is located in an old house with fun creaky floors and warm mood lighting. 

Outdoor seating is my personal favorite. I have always gone on weekend nights so there is sometimes live (but not overwhelming) music and quaint lights wrapped around the trees surrounding the tables. 

And as though the ambience wasn't enough, oh my god the food! My favorite pizza the is the diavla (spell?) which is a spicy salami pizza, and it tastes like what dreams are made of... The crust is crispy and the ingredients taste fresh! And the dessert! I HIGHLY recommend ANY crepes. They don't mess around. Fluffly and not to sweet, and always a perfect compliment to the nutella or fruit or vanilla ice cream. Honestly, they could probably put a pork chop in one of their crepes, and it would still be fantastic. Hahaha.

I recently visited Cibo while visiting my parents in Arizona. It was a recommendation by a colleague, and I had to share the experience with my lovely parents. Although there was a wait for sitting inside, we didn't mind, because we enjoyed a nice chilled glass of their House Chardonay. Although they said it would be a 20 minute wait, we were seated after 10 minutes. I loved the atmosphere, vibe and feel of Cibo. It's so cozy, and welcoming. 

On to the juicy stuff....the FOOD! We started with the Caprese Salad and Pesto Salad. They were both so amazingly delectable. The Caprese salad served it's purpose more than I imagined. The ginormous slices of fresh mozzarella were drizzled with a light olive oil, and accompanied by tomato slices and basil. It was served with some thinly sliced toast that the perfect compliment. On to the Pesto Salad! The Pesto dressing was phenomenal, and to be honst, I don't think I've had a pesto quite like this. It wasn't too thick, but complimented the bed of mixed greens, grape tomatoes, shaved parmigiano, pine nuts and roasted potatoes, perfectly!  For our entree's we ordered the Fughi Pizza, but added Spicy salame and Balsamic onions. I just went into dreamland thinking about how the pizza tasted when I took my first bite! Again, they had mounds of fresh mozzarella, mushrooms and a great tomato sauce. The addition of the balsamic onions and spicy salame took this pizza to a whole new level.  I love how thin the crust of the pizza was, which allowed you to enjoy the true beauty of their pizzas; the fresh cheese and sauce. 

I'm going to start a new paragraph just to describe how AMAZING the dessert was that we ordered. Since it was a belated Birthday dinner for my mother, we ordered a Crepe for dessert. It was filled with Mascarpone cheese, and my most favorite thing on earth, NUTELLA!! After all, life is much better with a spoonful of Nutella! It was dusted with powdered sugar, as well as melted chocolate sauce. We decided to forget all of our inhibitions, and added a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream. The warm crepe, accompanied by the ice cream, was delectably sinful! 

Before I give myself a heart attack describing the food any longer, I'm going to stop myself. Cibo is definitely a win\/win situation. Two thumbs up all around! I can't wait to go back!!",3,0,2

My Yelp buddy Kate and I had planned on coming down here a few weeks ago but it didn't pan out.  Tonight worked though and we met here for some dinner.  I found parking on the street (randomly, right behind their car lol..St. Louis Cardinal fans can smell each others cars I guess) and walked a block down.  The restaurant is really cool.  It's an old converted house which is funky and awesome in it's own way.  Kate and her husband got there before me and grabbed us a table inside. 

I sat down and ordered a Diet Coke to drink.  Kate and her husband had already ordered some appetizers for us (Polpette- Meatballs and Straccetti- Fried pieces of pizza dough topped with tomato sauce and parmigano and basil).  We then placed our order for our pizzas.  Me and Kate decided to split 2 pizzas so we could try out some different things.  We went with a basic Margherita and we also went with a white pizza called the Rustica which came with procsiutto and arugala.  Kates husband ordered the Calzone.  Here is how everything tasted...............

Appetizers:

Polpette-  They serve this dish with 3 meatballs which were topped with some grated cheese and a few slices of crusty bread.  These meatballs were very good!  They were tender and delicious.  The sauce these were in was very tasty too! 

Straccetti-  These come about 9 to a plate.  They are little strips of dough...think, funnel cake\/churro bites, but made out of regular dough.  They are topped with their delicious sauce and basil strips.  These were great too!  They seriously reminded me of little churro pieces but without the sugar on them.  Great fried dough and a definite repeat too.  

Pizza\/Calzones:

Margherita-  I usually order a plain pizza when I'm trying a new place out.  You can tell a lot about a pizza place just by their cheese pizza.  This rendition was pretty good.  Not as good as some other places in town, but still a tasty pizza.  I liked their sauce, cheese and crust.  I didn't like that they put too much basil on it plus it was cut really odd.  There were like 2 huge gigantic pieces and then 6 real small ones.   It was a tad thin in parts too.  Still, a good pizza but not a ""great"" pizza.

Rustica-  This was a white pizza (olive oil base) topped with prosciutto and arugala after it was cooked.  I didn't like this one nearly as much.  It sounded way better than it tasted.  It tasted like regular ham on pizza plus the arugala threw me off.  I don't need no stinking salad on my pizza!  I never had this kind of pizza before so I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't get it again.  This one was cut irregularly and a bit thin in spots too.

Calzone-  This may have been the best item ordered.  Louie chose well!  This calzone is a huge, football shaped pocket of goodness.  It had a great outer crust and it was stuffed with mozzarella, ricotta, some kind of spicy salame\/pepperoni and some other stuff too.  I only had a little sample of it, but I would definitely get it again if I come back.   It was tasty and better than the 2 pizzas we got.

Total bill was ?.  Louie grabbed the check before I could see it.  I threw in some money for a tip, we sat around and talked for a bit and then we were on our way.

Service was very friendly and attentive.  I liked the vibe of the place too.  I could see myself coming back for sure.  The food was like a 3, but the vibe, company I was with,  and the service bring it up to a 4 star joint!",15,9,11

I read the reviews about it before we went to I was super excited to go. We went for an early dinner arriving at 545pm and it was already pretty full. After sitting for a bit we noticed a bunch of ppl sitting outside waiting for a table. This place gets packed! We sat outside to the left beside the big tree with white lights- super nice! Underneath a heat lamp (my fav). The reviews are true, it was super yum! The only thing that was not the best was the service. Our waitress was a little out of it - she started off weird but after we order a bottle of wine and apps she warmed up. We started with a bottle of Scarpetta Pinot Grigio, Trentino Italy. The wine menu online is different. It was $30 and tasted good. We started with the Burrata - fresh mozzarella with a creamy heart topped with balsamic glaze served with black label prosciutto crucio and toasted bread ($14) I loveddddd the mozzarella - talk about quality mozzarella! I didn't eat the prosciutto b\/c im a vegetarian but my bf said it was tasty! There are 2 balls of mozzarella and they are big! We got another order of bread - warmed not toasted which tasted even better than the toasted. The waitress was very eager to bring us more bread and she warmed up and was helpful at this point. We both wanted pizza and salad so we decided to share Omero Salad ($12 - organic mixed greens topped w\/imported goat cheese, cucumbers, onions, caramelized walnuts and sliced strawberries, tossed with balsamic vinaigrette. We got the dressing on the side which was a good idea b\/c it was strong! It was a really really good salad  - moderate size nothing huge but nothing small. For the pizza we got La Noce off the PIzze Rosse (they have half Rosse pizza, with tomato sauce, and half Pizze Biache without tomato sauce). SUPER yummy and a big size! It had tomato sauce, mozzarella and ricotta, topped with arugula and walnuts after pizza is cooked. I loved it!

The ambiance is great. Very cozy indoors and garden dining outside. Best part of the visit was the atmosphere. Cheese and basil pizza came out to the table quick. I found lacking in flavor. No pepper, garlic, olive oil, or herbs in the sauce. Yet with the complete absence of seasoning, it was packed with salt. Also had the frittata which was had a nice texture and eggs were cooked perfectly. However, again, lacked seasoning.  I asked for ketchup and tabasco and mixed it together for a spicy ketchup that saved the dish. I was disappointed they didn't have a homemade ketchup or other homemade sauce for the eggs and potatoes.

Awkward, uncomfortable and RUDE is how our server made us feel with our party of only 4. We arrived during lunch time and we were the only ones at this restaurant. It was completely empty minus the employees.  We were seated immediately, but strangely our server obviously didn't want to be there at Cibo.  We informed it was our first time (at this OVERLY-hyped place) and was wondering what he would recommend? NO answer. We were interested in specials and asked if they offer anything with specials, he said NO not right now.  The server came and went numerously from our table and while we viewed the menu another party of 4 sat adjacent to us and a different server was cordial, polite and introduced himself by name, he relayed the specials of lunch and that dinner is approaching with happy hour specials.  My party and I were puzzled and said to one another, our server didn't relay any of this and why? He returned and we inquired about the specials, he said yes it's lunch still but we're approaching dinner soon. Can we still order off the lunch special menu? He said yes, but when my bf tried to order off the lunch menu our server then said ""I'm trying to PUSH the dinner"" and he said this Multiple times. I said, why? No response. Good for my bf when he stood firm on his decision and ordered off the lunch menu.  

Now the food: Although, the pizza was flavorful the pizzas are quiet small, more like a personal size and the dough is SUPER THIN and couldn't hold up my lightweight vegetarian ingredients. As soon as I picked up my slice the toppings immediately fell over and there was absolutely no structure support from the crust. This made it extremely challenging to eat. I folded it, rolled it and I mean this was Ridiculous.  3 of the 4 of us had the same complaints about the pizzas and quiet frankly it's not worth the price of what you get, they need to work on the portion size and their dough needs to be able to withstand light vegetables at least.  We also had the desert dough with Nutella, the dough seemed extremely stale.

Back to our server: He came and went, back and forth and every time he seemed to rush us with everything, but what's wrong with us enjoying what we have been served and enjoying our company? I finally got so irked at the server and straight up asked him ""are you in a hurry to get somewhere?"" He said no. I said, you sure have been acting like you do. Our server abruptly changed to someone else and without explanation. Our bill got messed up and took awhile to fix. Unsure if it was due to the change in servers.  Again, (AWKWARD).

I also wasn't sure if I should mention, yet I'm going to tell it. We sat at the corner of the restaurant where many flies were and yes we dined Indoors.  It was extremely annoying swatting them while at the dinner table.

We regret trying Cibo out. There pizza size and quality was more like an appetizer and thankfully we were asked by mutual friends to have dinner at the Federal and it was a 180 degrees a positive turn around that Cibo can take note of.  

Cibo is a cute place and I appreciate the restoration and flipping of a home into a business and their pizza is tasty, but they definitely need to improve on their customer service. Return factor: ZERO. Would I recommend it to anyone to give Cibo a shot? ABSOLUTELY NOT.",11,5,5

It's an old downtown house converted, like so many awesome places downtown, into a restaurant.  It's cozy and unpretentious.  A+ for atmosphere.
Just an fyi, during lunch, pizza is not served.  That just means I have to come back for dinner.  (Hopefully it won't take me another 5 years to do that).  At lunch, their delicious sandwiches and salads are available.  If you're not with your boss, you can also get a glass of pinot noir or chardonnay for $3.  I got a delicious lemonade and found a breakfast sandwich on the menu:  eggs, spinach, and ricotta on wood fired bread.  So good.

Component wise this pizza was top notch.  The crust was leopard spotted, perfect hydration for their oven, salted cornichone... Just perfect.

The sauce was excellent.  Not sweet, fresh, tangy, bomb.

Their mozzarella is milky goodness, and they throw the fresh bail on last after it's cooked. Magnifico!

People go around talking about their favorite pizza spots and it always boils down to some certain pizza configuration; however, a true pizza person must see through this fluff in order to see the true greatness.

Cibo has the right oven, the right temperature, the right wood, the right bakers ratios in use on their dough, fresh ingredients, and elegant flavors.  Don't get fooled into this pie or that.  Get into perfection.  Get into Cibo.",5,1,4

Like seemingly every other decent restaurant downtown, it too, is in a historic house.

This review is for lunch only - which means the menu is limited to sandwiches, salad and dessert.  It ain't cheap, so expect to throw down $30 for two for lunch.

Lunchtime draws in the crowd - your downtown business and government drones. Patio seating would have meant a 15 min. wait, but since we were in a hurry my downtown drone buddy and I opted for an inside table.  The feel inside is a warm urban rustic.

The food was very good.  The pizza\/panini bread used for the sandwiches is the standout here.  Freshly baked, warm and near perfect texture. I could have had a bread sandwich by itself and been just as satisfied.  I spotted an attractive fruit yogurt granola dish at a table next to me - turns out it's one of their side salads.  I highly recommend it.

Service was ok, but would have been better had I gotten my water when I asked for it upon ordering and not at the end of the meal after reminding the server.  An honest mistake.  No big deal.  Parking is lacking here.  With the exception of a tiny lot in the back, it's the streets, yo.  We ended up with a two block walk.  Not a big deal, but worth mentioning.

She didn't not even look at me or say Happy Birthday. Okay whatever. We ordered the Palline 2.0, the fried dough with a side of Nutella, and a pizza that had potatoes and sausage on it. 

The fried dough: I expected it to be soft and fluffy...but it was a lot harder than I thought. It was hard to chew.

Pizza: Meh...It was good? But it didn't really have a taste to it. I can taste the potatoes a little, but the cheese flavor was very mellow, and so was the sausage surprisingly. I did, however, taste the burnt crust very well. 

Free Nutella crepe: At least I got this for free for my birthday...but the crepe isn't as good as other ones I've tried.

I heard all the hype about Cibo and how great their pizzas are, we I'm not sure what everyone's talking about because both pizzas lacked quality and taste.
 First off the crust is very hard and chewy, your jaw becomes sore after half a slice. Not sure what they put in their dough but this is way too tough (maybe need a little more yeast?)  It's almost like eating a cold hard sourdough with tomato sauce on it. 
The toppings were non existent, a few little sprinkles of sausage, and pepperoni that's it!  The sauce bland, and the cheese just okay, We ordered the meat combo, I don't mind paying for good quality, but for this small little pizza, and for the little amount of topping this was unacceptable.
 I have been to good quality ""wood fired"" pizzerias and they were loaded with toppings and full of flavor and wonderful sauce and cheeses. Cibo pizza lacked in all areas, I will not come here again - the ambiance was quaint and nice however the pizza and salads and the rest of the fare is unacceptable.

We were greeted and shown to our table. After that, service was kind of lagging. Sure, we needed more time to peruse the wine menu and decide what to order, but when I told the server to give me a couple more minutes to pick my wine of choice, she never again asked me if I wanted a glass. In fact, she hardly came to our table at all. Didn't even ask how dinner was, if I remember correctly. Pity. 

I wanted so badly to like this place, and, in a way, I really did. I love the concept and the history of the bungalow. That gets an A+ from me. And the pizza we ordered was pretty amazing. I can't vouch for the wine. It seems like the menu is created for those who understand Italian or know alot about Italian food. Or, it's designed to be accompanied by an intelligent server who can walk you through the wine offerings and pizza choices. Even the specials sounded complicated. Maybe it's just me, but I don't want to feel less intelligent when I eat somewhere. A simple conversation about the restaurant and food would have been perfect, especially since neither Kym S or myself had ever been here before. 

As we dined, the place filled up quickly. And then I discovered that while this is a great little place to eat, don't expect to hold a conversation with your friend or date - it gets LOUD inside! If the weather permits, I recommend sitting outside. I'll take my own advice on that one.

The restaurant is located in an old vintage house - so those complaining about the atmosphere or grounds are way off the mark as the antique and rustic feeling is part of the vibe.

Is the Pizza as good as Bianco? No.

Is the pizza outstanding? Yes - no question.

Those comparing this to Bianco again again ad nauseum are missing the point. The pizza here has an extremely flavorful thin crust, and the pies are made by a real pizzailo chef straight from Italy. The pizza is generally perfectly charred, with a nice depth of flavors. This pizza is very similar to the pizza you might get in any good restaurant in Italy. 

So stop the whining and comparison to Bianco... sheesh! These are yummy pies any way you slice them, with some interesting twists like sweet aged Balsamic onions that my kids especially love. 

The salads here also rock - especially the Pesto salad with small crispy potato bits. Yum!

When you come to Cibo you will be treated like family. Sitting outside among the beautiful mature trees and the cool lights at night makes for a wonderful evening out, and few restaurants in Phoenix can match the consistently great food and ambiance. 

Desserts are outstanding, and the Nutella Crepe with vanilla ice cream is simply delicate and melts in your mouth - I like this one better than the Fresca (fresh fruit) crepe as it has a direct route to my sweet tooth.

So for the last few whiner Yelp reviwers...

I say go get yourself a pizza ""to go"" at Panne Bianco and pick up a Red Box movie... and just stay home!

They do not put Arugula on everything btw - goofy comments, what can you do lol.",4,0,3

Funny, sad, etc. But I thought I'd put a different twist on it since I'm not looking to leave anyone any time soon. I had a lunch meeting here instead (sorry Jason). 

We decided to eat outside on the patio and I was immediately reminded of that nuisance that is Phoenix restaurant misters in the summer. We had to move tables cause it would have been hard to have a lunch meeting, take notes, etc with our papers soaked! But really that shouldn't be a slam against Cibo per say because I know sooo many restaurants use those wasteful, ineffective, highly annoying devices.

Anyways...once we moved tables I really loved the ambience. The patio is gorgeous. I ate under a big tree that looked like you could climb in it, read a book, and be perfectly content. 

I had a salad (I can't remember the name now) with apples, candied walnuts, and gorgonzola cheese. It was delish!! The iced tea was amazing as well. Our server was really pleasant and not over attentive or too chatty, as she recognized that we were there to talk shop. 

I didn't get to poke around inside too much. But a restaurant in an old home seems to work well for Phoenix. 

We went at about 1:30pm and there was a small crowd. It seemed to be about the perfect time to hit them up. Enjoy!!",3,0,2

""It's amazing! The food is fantastic! The service is wonderful! They're so friendly there!"" they all cry with passion.

After my experience tonight, the only things I can think of are either (1) I somehow entered a parallel universe around that block and entered a different Cibo, kind of like that episode of ""Star Trek,"" or (2) every one of those sources from my first paragraph is full of beans.  Given that no one working in the restaurant had the necessary Evil Spock-esque goatee, I'm going to assume the latter.  Lest you think I'm being too negative about this place, let me say this: Cibo is definitely a place that serves food.

We (there were three of us) came in at 6:45 on a Friday and were able to get a seat within 5 minutes, even though the patio and inside were both packed - score!  It was a table tucked away in a corner, which we felt would be good for keeping ambient noise to a minimum,

After scoping out some of the food at the other tables, it was determined that a shared appetizer and two pizzas should have been enough for the three of us.  We chose the Schiacciata Maremma, which, besides being impossible for me to pronounce, was described as a roasted vegetable on focaccia-type sandwich, and the margherita (traditional) and funghi (mushroom) pizzas.

The sandwich came first, and we thought that the order may have been put in wrong.  While it was definitely two pieces of bread (that looked and tasted nothing like any focaccia that I've ever had, and not in the good way) with stuff in the middle, it seemed to be missing half of the ingredients.  Billed as being filled with ""mozzarella, roasted bell peppers, eggplant and zucchini,"" we discovered that there was neither eggplant or zucchini anywhere to be found.  Additionally, the whole sandwich was cold, depriving us of gooey, melted mozzarella-y goodness.  We would have complained to our waitress, but she had disappeared, deciding early on to abandon our table after taking our order, serving every other table in the section except for ours.

When the pizzas came (brought by a different waitress), things looked up.  THIS is what Cibo is known for, right?  Quality pizza with fresh ingredients!  Tasty, simple pizza.  Maybe it was a bit TOO simple.

The margherita pizza was a disaster.  The sauce was thin and runny, tasting like the tomato water left over from the can after the tomatoes were used to make the actual pizza sauce, with a lot of salt added in to attempt to cover for the lack of actual spices and seasoning.  The basil was haphazardly thrown on top, most of it still attached to one sprig.  I suppose that if Cibo was billed as an interactive cooking and eating experience, I might have appreciated that a bit more.  After the first slice was eaten, I figured that maybe I had grabbed a bad one (which can happen sometimes with pizzas), so I tried a different slice from the other side of the pie.  It was cold already, and quite soggy.  Since Cibo makes their pizzas with those ""brick oven blisters"" on 'em, this means that the remaining slices all had that watery charcoal flavor that tastes like the cooled-down grill you licked on a dare while drunk last Memorial Day.

The funghi pizza was passable.  The mushrooms did a good job of hiding a lot of the issues (mainly the sauce) that the margherita pizza had.  It too, however, decided that it should freeze up like the surface of Hoth (sans tauntaun innards) after the first slices were taken.

Fifteen minutes after we'd decided that we were done eating soggy pizza, our server decided to stop by our table again.  After all, the folks who were seated ten minutes after we were had completed their dessert, so she realized that she should probably see how our meal was going.  Drinks that had sat un-refilled since our appetizer was served were topped off without warning, and she walked away again, our napkin-covered plates still waiting to be picked up.  ""Do you want any dessert..."" she muttered in an almost muted tone after a different waitress cleared our table.  We said no and asked for the check.  Seven minutes later, she remembered to bring over the check.

We paid in cash and got the heck out of Dodge, wondering how so many people could have led us wrong, how the place stayed so busy, and if maybe, our taste buds had betrayed us.  After all, the denizens of the Arizona Republic, Yelp, and even ""Check Please! Arizona"" had vouched for this place, to say nothing of our friends and work acquaintances.  We decided that there's a massive conspiracy going on, and Cibo has either paid you all off, or laces their food with hypnotic suggestion drugs to which we are somehow impervious.

The food is bad. The service is awful. Stay away.",7,2,0

We chose to sit outside on a Saturday night. There was a bit of a wait, but I didn't expect to be seated right away on a weekend anyway. There was plenty of extra seating and live music, too, which made the wait more enjoyable. The patio ambiance was so nice and pretty. I'd like to check out the inside next time.

Our waitress recommended the burrata appetizer, which was awesome and filling, but light at the same time. We ordered the Diavola and Tartufata pizzas at other Yelpers' recommendations. Of course added ricotta to the Diavola- also after reading reviews. They were both amazing. The crusts were light and crispy, the toppings were flavorful... even leftovers the next day were great!

All of the pizzas I've had are super tasty, with local ingredients for toppings.  My favorite has to be the Diavolo with ricotta.  The salami has a nice spicy kick and the ricotta balances it out nicely.  Its a little warm during the summer, as most of the seating is outside.  But once the sun goes down and they turn on the decorative lighting, you forget you're in downtown Phoenix.  I'd recommend this place over Pizzeria Bianco anytime.

It was my first time and I was very curious since I hadn't realized it until we went there that this had been suggested by another friend a few weeks earlier.  Cibo is just west of Central Ave and very close to ASU Downtown and the Light Rail. 
Phoenix loves their ""Housetaurants"" Former houses turned restaurant. For this place, it works.  Walking up, the entire ""front yard"" is the patio seating.   Very cute setting lined with table umbrellas.  The lighting was enough to be comfortable in the setting and made it cozy.   It was charming.  If our friends had not been their before us, I would have suggested we sit outside.  It was super cute.  
We get in and we were seated in the back, a little pocket in the back of a long room.  I guess it was becuase of the size of our group.  
After looking over the menu, most of us decided to go with individual pizzas.  I got the Margarita pizza.  When i got it, it was delish!  It was pretty large for an individual so you might be taking some home.  We also got the Ostia Salad.  Wonderful flavors and the sharpness of the cheese shaved on it was a great start to the meal. 
One thing that was slightly off was the service.  When we got there, it was pretty empty and we were one of 2 tables in that section.  Our waitress, while knowledgeable of the items, always seemed like she was in a rush and really didn't give us the time.  My friend asked her a question and then when she took a second to make her decision she said ""Ok, well I'm going to have to come back to you, and went on to taking the rest of our orders.  It was kind of the tone and the fact she seemed rushed.  She also didn't visit the table as much as she should in my oppinon, especially since we were stuck in the back corner.  Then at the end of the meal, we saw why.  18% auto gratuity.  It never fails big group, poor service.  It wasn't bad enough to not go back, and like I said she was knowledgeable of the menu, but her overall attitude seemed like we were an inconvenience to her. Maybe she was missing the concert because she had to work? :)   Oh well, no big deal, we would definitely go back!",0,0,0

I also have a POI in my car that will give you names and locations or places close to where you are, between the two devices the place that both suggested was a place called ""Cibo"".

We live downtown and we thought, ""What the hell, it's close to the house and we haven't been there"". The only prerequisite that my girlfriend gave me was ""NO Pizza's"",as  she had just gotten back from Chicago and had pizza the night before.

By the way, she is Gluten Free, so I'm thinking were out of here and back to our search. Well the bartender comes up and we tell her our dilemma, she explains that they have the best ""Gluten Free Pizza in the World"". She just so happened to be ""Gluten Free"" also. So we decided let's go for it.

I am half Italian and was raised with Pizza, it was left overs on a pie crust., my grandfather put everything in the fridge on his Pizza. I'm not a big fan of Pizza for that reason, i still think of it as a way to get rid of leftovers.

Simply the best Pizza i have ever had in my life, ""Gluten Free"" or otherwise. This place is a gem and we will be spending a lot of time at this place moving forward. All weekend all we could think about was how good the Pizza was on Friday.

Go there if you haven't and you will love the atmosphere and especially the Pizza. If your ""Gluten Free"" it's a bonus because your in for a treat. I have found my only Pizza place from this moment forward. I will not go out to eat Pizza unless it is at Cibo's. I just can't even tell you how great it is, you will have to just try it yourself.

We ordered a  salad that was had pear's as the main ingredient and there weren't many pears and dabs of honey. Just thought it was a little cheap. 
Then the pizza, there wasn't much cheese on there and the ingredients seem to be again cheap. The dessert seemed to be the same way.
Finally when the waitress brought our check and came back with the change she said she didn't have time to get us the change so we could add that into the tip. So she shorted us .40 some cents.

Well, it's not a gourmet crust like Pizzeria Mozza in LA.  It's probably the closest thing I've had to pizza I've found in Rome.

***********************
Once again, another solid place in Phoenix!  I know this is going to sound really disloyal to my city, but I think that SF could learn a thing or two from good old Phoenix in terms of casual but upscale restaurants..... This is in addition to the lack of good patio options in SF - which of course is abundant in Phoenix , in addition to space heaters that are turned on if the temp is anything lower than 70 degrees (yes, Arizonans consider this to be chilly - sounds ridic. to us SFers).  Anyway, my co-workers and I had a great meal here the other night on the beautiful front patio.  The starters (pear and pecorino salad, antipasto platter) and pizzas were all yummy!  My favorite was the Rustica - yummy prosciutto with arugula, but I also really liked the Diavolo(sp?), with salami, sharp tomato sauce, and just the right amount of cheese.  And the dessert crepes were fab!  We got the Nutella + mascarpone, and the Nutella with  bananas - both very good.  All in all a great meal!  All served outside in the balmy Phoenix evening, on a quaint patio.... I was loving it!!  I want to come back again, and save time for some drinks before dinner - there are also cute little nooks on the other side of the patio, with couches \/ chairs and even a firepit!",3,1,2

Being in my third trimester, however, I wanted to avoid the hour long waits I was reading about all the pizza places in town, and decided to go during lunch time. Unfortunately, I didn't do my research enough and didn't realize that Cibo does NOT serve pizza during lunch, only sandwiches; pizza is only at dinner time. 

After the initial disappointment, and being too hungry to go somewhere else, we decided to go ahead and order. For a weekday lunch, it was still pretty busy. No wait, but only seats available were at the bar, and just 2 seats were available. However it looked like the turnover was quick. Service by the guy at the bar was relatively quick and very friendly, but he was running around like crazy taking care of both customers at the bar and at tables. 

All the sandwiches are made with the fresh baked focaccia made in the brick ovens. Very fresh and tasty. Not oily at all like a lot of other focaccia's I've had. Good texture, chewy without being tough. There's a choice of cold vs hot sandwiches, my husband and I both got hot ones...I got a mozzarella, tomato and pesto i think? Whatever it was, it was good. My husband got the pulled pork buffalo style...He enjoyed it...I'm not a big fan of buffalo style sauce so I can't really comment on it. You have a choice of side salad or fruit salad witht he sandwhiches, or chips, which we didn't get. The salad was fine, fresh, well dressed. The fruit salad was a bit of a surprise...more of a parfait w\/ some thick whipped cream and granola on top. It was good, but being lactose intolerant, it came as a bit of a surprise, so just a warning for those who can't tolerate dairy, or thought they were being healthy by ordering a fruit salad.

Service: Our waitress was nice. However, she didn't give us much in the way of promoting the food or guiding our decision. She didn't go over the specials or any of the dishes.

What We Liked:
-Atmosphere: elegant without being pretentious, nice outdoor and indoor, simple decor, charming home converted to restaurant
-Pizza: we enjoyed the pizza, thin crust with a nice wood-fire char. 

What We Disliked:
-The Gnocchi: although the texture was perfect to me (pillowy, soft, handmade), the flavor fell flat. I didn't feel it was special the way a good gnocchi dish is. It is also very small in portion. And although I do agree with the waitress that it was filling, part of enjoying a dish is the initial appearance, and the initial appearance was sad, served in a small cast iron skillet, and looked a bit ""cheap"" with a bread crumb crust. We confirmed it was actually the entree because first glance we thought it was an appetizer. 
-Opted out of desert because we were underwhelmed by the food.

Overall, the service and food fell flat. Which I think is challenging to do with a cream gnocchi dish. I appreciate simple flavor and although  it was certainly rich, the dish just lacked too much in flavor.The pizza was good, however it is comparable to many other pizzerias in the Valley. I want to like this charming place, and I would come back and give it another try if someone else suggested it and wanted to check it out.",0,0,0

Cibo pizza is best eaten soon after it comes out of the oven. Last night, we order two pizzas, a red and a white. For the red we got half Funghi and half Capricciosa. For the white we ordered Dolce Vita and Tartufata. I thought I would enjoy the red more, but it was the two white ones that were the winners. 

Both pizzas came out warm with burnt crust. The pizza is thin and a little soft in the center, which made for a soft, doughy crust. If I had to pick a favorite of the night, it would be the Dolce Vita. Creamy burrata cheese topped with spek, arugula, and a slightly sour\/sweet balsamic glaze was the perfect combination. The other three were old delicious and flavorful as well.

To go with our pizzas, we ordered the calamari and assortment of grilled mixed vegetables. Both were average but I was disappointed that the vegetables were cold and did not taste grilled. I would not order either again. 

Parking can be difficult in this residential neighborhood and the wait to get a table can get long as well. The outdoor seating area is beautiful with twinkle lights making the place sparkle  every night. Cibo is a great place for date night or just a casual get-together with friends. 

What I recommend:
- using the Yelp app to hold your place in line
- Dolce Vita (pizze bianche)",4,0,0

Then our waiter spent 15 minutes detailing every pizza on the menu...duh, like we couldn't read them for ourselves.  He fawned over the menu until we were sick of him and just wanted to order.  First came our salads, which he insisted we get.  All I can say is yuk.  They just were weird and not that good for the price.

Then he disappeared.  Two non-english speaking girls brought our pizzas, but wouldn't take our six dirty salad plates and utensils.  What fun it is to eat your main course with dirty dishes all over the table.  Our waiter had GUARANTEED us that the pizzas would be the best we had ever eaten.  Meh.  I've had better at NYPD Pizza.  

But what really ticked me off is that we could get no refills on beverages, no dirty dishes cleared, and nobody would get me a clean fork to eat my calzone.  For this price I think I'm entitled to a clean utensil.  Yes, the menu states that parties 6 or more will have gratuity automatically added.  I'm cool with that, except that at Cibo's that means ""after we take your order we don't have to offer you any more service, and we still get our 20%.""

I loved the decor and the feel of the place that puts you into a storybook or some other space and time.  I also thought I would see a ghost of some kind, but it all went well ( this is not Hollywood either).

The pizza is on par with Bianco.  I recommend getting a pie per person so you can try a variety.  Also, I usually prefer red pizzas, but the whites here at Cibo always end up being my favorite.

I will give them a 5 out of 5 on service and ambiance.  We sat out on the patio with twinkling lights and live music from the flute player. A very nice and romantic setting. 
We had the meatballs for a starter and they were really good and a very generous portion. We had to take some home in order to not spoil our appetite for the pizza. 

We got the capricciosa pizza that has mozzarella, prosciutto cotto, artichoke, black olives, and mushrooms. I guess it's  shame on me for not realizing that prosciutto cotto was not prosciutto as I know it but sliced deli meat ham, and the artichoke tasted like it came out of a jar. Over all the pizza lacked any distinguishing flavors, very bland and a lack of texture in the toppings.  The pizza crust was thin and crispy, maybe we just ordered the wrong thing?

Their salads with pine nut goodness, their sandwiches with the bread that holds up no matter the insides, the iced tea.  Oh good lord almighty that tea is great.  So yeah, after two lunches at Cibo with Jesse, I am definitely sold on the joint.  BUT that is not to say that Cibo is flawless.  Let us proceed...

Jesse was having a crazy busy day, and I was bored.  We decided to lunch early and headed over to Cibo, since Jesse had been craving it.  We arrive in the neighborhood north of Van Buren where the quaint little sandwich\/pizza house is located, and immediately I note the line of cars up and down one street, along with the line of tractors ripping up the intersecting one.  There at the corner lies her beloved eatery, with many chin-up suits and aging re-debutantes making their way towards it from all directions.  Jesse, sensing the parking challenge that was soon to present itself, slammed the brakes.  ""Go get us a table.""

I'm out of the car like a greased-up salamander out of a Mexican Coke bottle.   Scuttling across the street to get ahead of all the winners, I'm considering my seating preference.  It's a little warm out, but all the shade trees in Cibo's courtyard would fix that right up.  Then I remembered the close quarters the last time we sat outside, not to mention Jesse's disgust at being seated next to a table with *GASP* a child.

I didn't know what things were like inside, but it hardly mattered.  My mind was made up, and when the hostess showed me to our window table in the small dining room near the bar, I realized it didn't matter at all.  The whole place was close quarters, except now we were gonna be inside, which meant way better acoustics!  Full tables all around.  This place is way above the radar and has been for some time, so this was to be expected.  What I didn't expect was the high-haired doughy woman in the electric lime muumuu sitting directly in my line of vision.  She ultimately heightened my experience a great deal just by showing up, although I couldn't help wondering which tribal casino was calling all the hospitals, looking for their most loyal customer.

Jesse ended up ordering the caprese sandwich with added prosciutto (server was happy to oblige), and I had the BBQ pulled pork.  Jesse's sandwich was pretty good.  My sandwich was MAGNIFICENT.  The spice was a pleasant surprise, and also gave me a bit of good old-fashioned sweat-face.  I wasn't really feeling the couple of flies buzzing around us during our chewing time, but to be fair I didn't know who they belonged to, so I can't in good faith pin it completely on the establishment.  Also, the server seemed to forget we were there a couple of times, which is always fun.  But hey, I'm sure the Carries outside needed their lemon water refills real bad, having just played their freckle-tanned backs off in the breast cancer tennis match they just came from.

It may seem from my review that I didn't have the best time.  This absolutely IS NOT the case.  I don't think lunch at Cibo could have gone any better.  The cramped eating space, outspoken clientele, somewhat negligent wait staff, all these should be, well, kind of expected when partaking of a place like Cibo.  It's almost like dinner theater - get in, get settled and get ready for the show.  And whenever possible, watch for muumuus.",1,4,1

I like to sit outside on beautiful Phoenix nights and soak in the smell of the desert, but only nights when there isn't any live music.

The decor of Cibo is so cute and charming. The lights outside on the trees are a good addition to outside lighting. The environment is good for a date night, wine night with girlfriends, or family dinner. 

Since this was a large birthday dinner we were seated outside. When we first arrived there were no seats available for my sister and I. While they figured out how to add a few extra seats we decided to go inside to order a drink from the bar. While standing at the bar our waitress from outside came up to us (who we had not even seen yet) and ""barked"" at us that we can order drinks from outside. She then very RUDELY asked what can she get us. We order our drinks and my sister proceeded to ask her is we can start a tab, she again barked at us and said NO they don't do tabs. I could not believe how rude she was being. My sister casually said ""ok I will pay cash, I feel like I am starting to annoy you"" Her response was ""ok thanks""!!!! I was appalled!! 

Once we got seated outside the waitress' rude behavior continued. She just kept barking things at the guests, such as ""are you ready to order?"" in the rudest tone of voice! It was not just us, I witness her rudeness towards other guests at the table. My boyfriend ordered a beer and she brought the wrong one out. I corrected her and she says ""oh we were out of that one, but this beer is pretty much the same thing"". I am sorry but when is it EVER acceptable to do this. The correct thing would to come back tell the guest and recommend the similar beer or ask if there is anything else they would like. 

Through out the time she continue to reach over guests without saying excuse me. I witnessed her spilling water on a guest without apologizing. I realize we were a larger party but if you cannot handle it ask for help or trade tables with someone. I am sorry you got the largest table in the place and made a hefty tip (not from me however) 

The ONLY reason I rated Cibo a 4 instead of a 2 was because their food really was fantastic and my sister promises that she has never received anything less than great service from the waiters.

Can easily be a ""casual dress"" place but it's got a romantic aspect to it and many people dress up, too.

Really a neighborhood gem!",1,2,1

However, Karen graciously invited us back to make up for it, a gesture I really appreciate. Things were much different this time around. The food was wonderful and the atmosphere was lovely. We had the buratta, two soft scoops of mozzarella with proscuitto and bread. Yum! I guess it's not always on the menu so get it if you can. We also had the di note pizza and the nutella and mascarpone crepe. Everything was perfect and made with care. Thank you, mike and Karen for taking such good care of your customers! I will definitely be back. 

I've been sneaking bites of my leftovers and they are still just as delicious! I'll be thinking about the buratta until the next time I get to eat it.",3,1,2

Cibo is one of the few restaurants in Phoenix that is open until later, and we came in to try their thin crust pizza. It is in a bit of a strange location, and is the only restaurant\/store in that area. At first, we thought we entered the address incorrectly in the GPS, since Cibo doesn't have a lot of lighting in the front of the restaurant. It was close to 10:45pm on a Friday night, and the restaurant still had a good amount of tables, but we seated right away. We ordered:

-Funghi (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Mushrooms, $11.50, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/cibo-phoenix?select=4Tnb6awzTKGHJfdSdC1iJg#cYFU7ejhfB6tKUHWXCWvkw): Just ok for me. I thought the tomato sauce was a bit too tangy. However, this pizza is good for those who enjoy a classic and simple pizza. I wouldn't order this again though.
-La Dolce Vita (Burrata and Speck [Smoked Prosciutto] Topped w\/Arugula and Balsamic Glaze, $16.50, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/cibo-phoenix?select=4Tnb6awzTKGHJfdSdC1iJg#4Tnb6awzTKGHJfdSdC1iJg): Delicious! This was one of their specials that night. I've never had a pizza with burrata on it before, and I was glad we gave this a try. The burrata went really well with the speck, arugula, and balsamic glaze, but I think swapping the speck for guanciale would also be really tasty.

Their pizzas are split into red sauce and white sauce sections, and they have a good amount of variety for each type of sauce. We wanted to order more (the salads looked really good), but we had already snacked during the baseball game so weren't super hungry. I really appreciated that Cibo was still welcoming customers even though it was close to closing time- there's nothing worse than rushing to get to a restaurant before closing and the staff death staring you through the meal. Even though it was past closing when we left, there were still a good amount of customers still at the restaurant having a great time. The only slight complaint I have is that our server (I can't remember his name.. maybe Tom?) was really weird. He tried to crack a few really lame jokes, and become overly chummy with us. It was just a strange experience interacting with him, and none of us felt comfortable. I saw him drinking a glass of wine later on, so he probably got started a little too early. In any case, if you're looking for a good meal while out in Phoenix, and\/or love thin crust pizza, make sure to check out Cibo!",0,0,0

We had a bottle of wine on the waiter's suggestion, It was a cab, I don't remember the name, but it paired very well with our meal. We started with the burrata which was so fresh-- to die for.

The caprese was probably the best I'd had anywhere, with grape tomatoes rather than the usual romas, and just so much deliciousness. The pizza is good, as well. I wasn't hugely impressed by an omelette I had the first time I visited, nor the service that time, but I sometimes encounter that when I dine alone and the service has been good since.

YES, you read correctly. I'm a huge sucker for an awesome, crisp to perfection, deliciously stuffed, delightfully tasteful crepe & I will tell you this, they are HARD to find.

Before calling it a night last night, I didn't want to take the chances of missing the opportunity to enjoy one of these babies before our departure back home. So, I called in an order around 10pm (luckily they close at 11 on saturday nights). I ordered the banana & nutella crepe w\/strawberries added to it. I didn't want the 'a la mode' as I didn't want the ice cream melting on the drive home. 

O.M.G.......This was delicious! I HAD to open it up in the car to see what it looked like (wish I hadn't, it made me hungrier) it looked amazing! As soon as we got back to our rooms, I couldn't help but start indulging it. It was perfectly crispy on the outside with drizzled chocolate and powdered sugar on top, the inside was even more of a delight being completely stuffed!

I absolutely love going to Cibo for many reasons.  What is there not to love about this place.  Cibo is a restaurant set inside of an early 20th century bungalow with beautiful hardwood floors and exposed brick. When you walk through the main doors, you are greeted by the hostess stand and a small quaint bar... there are several dining ""areas"" throughout the restaurant, as this was a ""house"" that has been renovated in the historic Filmore area just off the main downtown area of Phoenix.  

The pizza here is fantastic.  People often compare this pizza to another popular pizza restaurant in Phoenix.  I don't think that there is a comparison.  Cibo is so much better.  I have tried several pizzas here, but my favorite, surprisingly, is the Genova.  I always order the pizza well done and the crust comes out nice and crisp.

I love the Pear Salad as well.  The salad is huge and can be share between 2 friends.

You must also try the lemoncello.  It is divine and the best in Phoenix that I've tried other than homemade.

Main entrance..11 o'clock 3 two tops..bam right there not 5 ft from the door. 12 o'clock kitchen, 1 o'clock bar, 3 o'clock  two 2 tops lining the wall. We were offered one of the 11'oclock tables but there was no way. There is nothing I hate more than sitting on top of another table. They were so close even Nicole Ritchie couldnt squeeze between them. This space would be better served by 3 small high bar tables, allow for more traffic space and you're not forced to dine with strangers. Needless to say I would rather wait for a table that avoids the potential of being bumped and or drinks\/food being spilled on me. We were seated in a side room and it was perfect, not too close to fellow diners yet still feeling a part of the energy. From the seating to departure was excellent. Service, was impeccable. Pizza's take a bit but they're made from scratch and worth waiting for. I ordered a white pizza (Salsiccia con Patate) and it was perfection.. My friend ordered a red pizza which I tried and you can taste the fresh tomatoes, no canned sauce here. Although extremely tasty Im still loyal to Spinatos on the red pizza. But white pizza they have my vote. Made sure I didnt gorge because I was dying to try their dessert. I am a HUGE fan of Nutella and they have 3 or 4 variations on Nutella crepes..I had the banana\/nutella concoction with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and Im salivating being reminded of it. Nice call on the dessert Cibo, if not the white pizza I will return for the dessert. Either way I will be back.

i've only gone their at lunchtime when they only serve sandwiches and salads. some of the best italian sandwiches i've ever had. they run about 9 dollars, but they are big and come with a salad.

you also have to split a strawberry nutella crepe for desert with somebody sometime. they are amazing.

only problem is trying to find parking and there is very little indoor seating, which makes it hard to eat at during the summer. but for the rest of the year, there is a great patio surrounded by greenery. great place to relax.

beware it also has some strange hours. no lunch on the weekends and there are some nights where they don't serve dinner.

the staff is also extremely friendly and helpful.

I have been dying to participate in the Cibo vs Bianco challenge but the long wait at Bianco rarely fit into my schedule. That is, until my friend and I were able to stop in for lunch on a weekday when there was no wait...

The verdict? CIBO WINS!

Better menu, much bigger selection of pizzas, salads, and antipasti. Better prices (Bianco's pizzas are either $13 or $16, Cibo has many more choices ranging from $10.50 to $16.50 but most of their option avg. $14). Cibo offers a fantastic variety of pizza toppings.

The food at Cibo has never let me down. I have tried a number of things on the menu and it makes ordering very difficult these days because EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!! But, if I had to create an All-Star Meal it would be as follows:

Pesto Salad (or Pear Salad; dammit, this is already tough)
Antipasto Speciale (meat, cheese, olives, roasted peppers...and I remember these balsamic onions that I can't get enough of)
Salsiccia (the BEST sausage pizza)
Nutella and banana crepe (enough said)

This meal would feed 3 people, EASY!! My husband and I typically order two pizzas and a salad and still have a couple of pieces to take home.

I should also mention that we got married at Cibo almost two years ago. The food and service was impeccable that day (as always). Prepare to be impressed.",4,0,5

You cant go wrong with any of their choices.  The wine list was very nice and the pinot noir we enjoyed was excellent.  The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and helped us with our selection quite a bit.

During our visit we had the ""privilege"" of eating at Pizzeria Bianco Tuesday night... after a 2+ hour wait. My father had suggested we go eat there after seeing this place mentioned on one of his Food Network shows. I must say the atmosphere is decent, the service so so, and the pizza just OK. 

So, the next night I took my wife to a place I had eaten at last summer named Cibo which is just a few blocks away. After the first taste of her Siena pizza she turned to me and said ""this place blows away Bianco""... she is right. 

When you are there you must try the Burrata appetizer. I had the pleasure of trying it last summer when it was just added to the menu and was glad to see it stuck around. I seriously doubt there is a pizza on the menu you will not like but that night we had the Diavola as well as the Siena mentioned above (both fabulous). Make sure to finish off the evening with some homemade Limoncello and you will gladly thank me later...

We got lucky enough to find a seat on the patio and were able to dine under a perfect Phoenix sky. Our server was named Melissa and she was great. She suggested the perfect wine for our meal and was very attentive the whole time we were there.

Cibo is the average answer to Pizzeria Bianco.  I can't believe they've even been compared  - the only similarity I can think of is geography.  The crusts are worlds apart - at least on the night we went. 

We chose to take some out of town guests to Cibo last night because of:
(1) all the praises we read on Yelp and other media
(2) the fact that it's one of the few well-regarded independent places open on a Monday night
(3) it looked cute from the outside

Apparently, other people thought the same.  All the tables for four were full inside so we took a table in the patio, which turned out to be a blessing because we got lots of privacy to talk.  

The downside though was getting the attention of the waiter.  Ice water was poured and menus were handed out as soon as we sat down but the waiter appeared over 15 min later.  When we ordered a refill on a glass of wine after the appetizer, he came with it almost at the end of our meal.

We order the antipasto speciale, large ($17) to share.  The plate was huge:  generous slices of prosciutto, 3 slices of bresaola with shaved pecorino on arugula, 4 slices of grilled zucchini,  mounds of balsamic pearl onions, giant olives, grilled red peppers with capers and parmesan, and cherry tomatoes with bocconcini and basil.

Pizzas are split between Rosse (red) and Bianche (white).  On the waiter's recommendation, we ordered these: 
- Red: Diavola (tomato sauce, mozz and spicy salame)  $13
- White: Siena (grilled zucchini, mozz, speck (smoked proscuitto) and pecorino)  $14

VERDICT: Cibo vs Pizzeria Bianco

The toppings were generous and tasty but the major complaint we had was the CRUST.  Pizza's all about the crust.  This was more like charred bread - it was not crusty in the least bit.  The dough had a nice chew to it but no crunch whatsoever.  

Chris Bianco's dough is so brilliant because there's an awesome contrast between the crusty exterior and the pillowy interior.  Chris' crust is so thin that you can inhale slice after slice but here we had trouble eating more than 2 slices.  

Even though this pizza was baked in a brick oven, there was no smokiness to it - almost as if it was flash-baked.  Pizzeria Bianco's crust not only has texture but a complex-flavored interior and smoky exterior.  Eating pizza will never be the same again...

WINNER:  Pizzeria Bianco",4,2,4

I like it better than Bianco and in some ways is comparable to a New York slice. But definitely a good decision to check out CIBO if you're in the mood for a good pizza in Phoenix! One key to good pizza is the dough and the crust is soft!

Great atmosphere, ambiance, quaint any time of the year. Love the outdoor seating on the patio with fire areas, live music and an assortment of lights. Service was okay, I had an empty water the whole meal. 

I would definitely come back here and try some other pizzas and maybe an entree. For dessert, we had the strawberry banana crepe with Nutella - I mean a crepe with chcoclate, yum. But they were out of their other chocolate dessert :( Let me rewind back to appetizer, caprese salad is enough for a handful of people. The mozzarella tossed with pesto, oregano, EVOO, chopped fresh basil and grape tomatoes is absolutely scrumptious.

We started with the Ostia Salad, which is huge.  More than enough for two to share. The chickpea dressing is different, but in a good way.  Think runnier hummus.  The fried parsnips were a unique touch and the croutons. wow.

The highlight was the Tartufata pizza.  White Truffle Oil. That's all I'm gonna say there. I detest mushrooms so I had my half without the fungus.  The prosciutto was crispy and the truffle oil made the pizza decadent and rich.

I'd been craving a good pizza to get the bad taste of The Parlor out of my mouth for a few weekends now, and Cibo is our favorite.  We've been here dozens of times, and it never disappoints.

We did our usual- our own salads (I have to always get the Caprese which is the best I've ever had with fresh tomatoes, delicious fresh mozzarella, and just enough pesto), and splitting a pizza- half diavolo for him, and half margherita for me.  He swears by the diavolo- being a pepperoni lover, he's obviously a fan of cured meats, but says this is way better than pepperoni.  Margherita is always so good with the sauce, just enough mozzarella, and whole basil leaves.  Then the usual desserts- the fresca for him which is a huge heaping crepe full of fresh fruit, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream, and the crepe Suzette for me, which comes flaming.  Crepe Suzette is my favorite dessert, and Cibo does it as well as any Parisian restaurant I've been to.

The only downside was that its very small inside and the sound of people talking crescendos to the point that I could barely hear myself think, let alone hear what my lunch colleagues were saying.

I took issue with service. The waitress was very short (not in length), not attentive, and fazed from her job. Water glasses came 2\/3 full, which was weird. I found the pizzas to be just overdone enough to have an off-putting bitterness. And I did not like the tiramisu. It was just thick heavy cream without the nice texture of freshly soaked ladyfingers.  

So I don't know if I'll be back..maybe with a smaller group on a not-so-busy night.",4,0,0

I am not a very patient person and 3 hours for a pizza is pushing it, even though I love pizza it is one of my favorite foods.  Back to Cibo it was a little hard to find at night because it is dimly lit.  Which is nice and romantic when you get inside, especially since it was my girlfriend and I.  It is a located in a re purposed bungalow house, which is great to help keep part of downtown's history.  

We ordered the Anitpasto Speciale which was really good although the roasted red peppers were overly done and mushy.  We had trouble picking a pizza and the waiter was very helpful.  He told us that they were individual sized pizzas but since we split the Antipasto platter we could share one.  We ordered the Salsicca pizza which came with tomato sauce, sausage and mozzarella. It was a really good thin crust pizza.  The crust was crispy and had a little char it actually tasted like a fresh baked tortilla (like mom used to make).  

We did have room for desert so we each ordered our own crepe, thinking they would be a single rolled crepe.  We should of shared one because they were as big as the pizza.  I ordered the Nutella and mascarpone crepe which was good.  My girlfriend ordered the Nutella and banana crepe which was delicious.

We definitely will be back again for another romantic dinner.  Oven fired pizzas, fresh and imported Italian ingredients and reasonably priced.  It can't be beat.",4,2,2

Our first meal was at Cibo, and it far exceeded our expectations.

First of all, dining al fresco in Phoenix is a ""thing."" A lot of restaurants have outdoor seating, and especially on nice, warm nights, it really adds to the overall dining experience. The ambiance at Cibo is amazing. There are lights strung in the patio, with the lowkey sounds of a live band in the background.  We were fortunate enough to be blessed with a nice, warm, May evening, so everything really worked in our favor.

The pizza at Cibo is amazing. Amazing. I can't emphasize that enough. We ordered the pizze rosse diavola (tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy salami and ricotta) and thepizze bianche tartufata (mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and a drizzle of white truffle oil). Both were delicious- savory, and packed full of flavor with every bite.

I'd come back to dreary Phoenix just to have another slice of one of these pizzas.",2,0,0

We came here at night which seems like the best time to come. The ambiance and decor was very romantic when we sat on their outside patio. However, the food was mediocre. The pizza we ordered was far from amazing...prosciutto crudo. The base of the pizza tasted plain with prosciutto just thrown on top. Our salad was good. And it also felt like we were forgotten for a while since they sat us outside. We hardly saw our server, but when we did, she was very kind and accomodating. I would recommend this place if I was going on a first date and food didn't matter to me.",0,0,0

It seems to me that this was a table that was just not going to be happy no matter what. Without exception, every time I've gone to Cibo I've been warmly welcomed by both the owners and the wait staff and the level of service they provide is laid back and exceptional. They're not hovering over your table waiting for you to take your last bite so they can whip the plate from under your nose but they are discreet and attentive at all times. There is a family atmosphere in this restaurant and just watching how much the wait staff love their bosses and what a good time they seem to have at work makes me jealous I don't have a boss like that!  I have brought countless friends and family to Cibo for all sorts of occasions and am made to feel like a VIP every time I walk throught the front door. As someone who eats out quite a lot and has been in the service industry, albeit many years ago, I find it amazing that a group of six would argue with a busy waiter about splitting a check six ways, how embarrassing. What is the problem with just putting in cash for your share when you know you're eating as a large group? Or even splitting it evenly between three couples on credit cards. And complaining about a 20% gratuity? Show me any good restaurant that doesn't charge an inclusive gratuity for parties of 6 or more. As for the comments about refills-always have my water and coffee refilled as soon as it gets low-and the portion sizes, well I've yet to bring anybody to Cibo who can finish a whole salad and pizza, the portions are more than generous. Overall I feel I'm a discerning diner who has high standards and I've found a real gem in Cibo, so excuse me if I'm a little overprotective but I feel that Tom H's review was completely unfair to the amazing ambience and fabulous staff at Cibo.",2,0,0

The delicious smells, the live music, the twinkly little lights draped all around the yard...I just knew it was going to be wonderful. 

We were quoted 20 min for a party of two for first available, but I read on yelp to expect that to be off -and it was...closer to 40 minutes- but it was a nice evening, and I was mentally exhausted from the long drive from Las Vegas, so I didn't mind that. 

We are seated and I was excited we wound up with a nice patio seat. Our server brought us some menus and when we ordered water she sort of rolled her eyes at us. I don't know how the serving situation works here - one young lady was handing water, wrapping silverware, and apparently picking up all the slack of the actual waitress. She brought us water, and about 15 min later, seeing we still had menus, kind of shook her head to herself and got the actual waitress. We ordered and she disappeared again, but the girl with water checked on us and brought us a little carafe. 

The people beside us had ordered dessert as we ordered our food, 1 dessert to share. The people from the kitchen ended up coming to ask what they had ordered. Our food showed up, and it was really good. We got a quattro formaggi and the pizza with speck, Asian pears and goat cheese. We finished and waited for the bill, and then waited to pay. Finally ready to leave, we realized we needed to break a $20 for the valet. I walked back inside, (where by the way wait staff runs past you each time you walk in the door and makes you feel tremendously in their way) and the host acted like I was really bothering him by asking such a menial question and said that he didn't have any change to give me and I should has asked my server, to which I almost replied ""I would, had I ever seen her for more than 2 seconds."" (Like I said, almost told him that, I try to be friendly and polite though.) 

I walked back out and saw my server, asked her to break a 20, she said the valet should have change, then threw her head back laughing? I don't know, it was very odd. The nicest person i encountered here was definitely the young lady (I'm 31, so the younger-than-me lady) handling water and silverware. I hope she is getting a cut of the tips, and had I been able to get change before walking out to the car, I definitely would have slipped her some of it. 

Those poor people beside us might still be waiting for their Fresca, whipped cream on the side.

Cibo serves Italian style pizza in a cozy classic downtown house with a darling yard. If avoid the busy night (Friday and Saturday) it is usually fairly easy to get a nice table outside. 
They have a good list of salads, I usually go for the pear salad but their burrata is also quite tasty. Their pizza use simple ingredients and are delicious - stay classic with a margarita or add a little fun they are all delectable. Can't speak for their other dishes as I go there for pizza... And desert, the ""fresca"" which is ice cream, crepe, whipped cream and berries is just a nice way to end your meal and probably your diet.

   When I called to make reservations 10 days before wishing to dine there, the man told me that they don't usually take reservations for parties of five, ""but that he'd see what he could do.""  He had a vaguely condescending tone.  Then when I had the nerve to ask him if we could be on the patio, he kind of laughed and said, ""the patio fills up quickly but again, I'll see what I can do.""  Seeing as though I made the reservation 10 days in advance, I'd think the patio wouldn't be booked up that far out....but maybe I'm mistaken.  

  When we got there the night we dined, it was a perfect night and the patio was beautiful with twinkly lights on all the trees.  When we gave our names for our 7:30 reservations, the owners,( I'm assuming they're the owners, they seemed to be a couple) seemed very stressed out and told us they would seat us as soon as possible.....and we waited....and we waited.  I was the designated driver so I ordered a club soda with lime, but this establishment only has $6 bottles of Italian sparkling water, which certainly added up throughout the evening.  We had cocktails as we stood on the ramp leading from the restaurant to the patio, being jostled about by waiters and patrons frequently.  My brother asked me if I knew what the word ""Cibo"" meant.  I said I did not.  Then he said with a sly grin, ""It means SLOW.""  Finally, after waiting about 40 mins., we were seated.

  We seemed to have 3 or 4 waiters.  It didn't really affect the experience too much except that we didn't know who to ask for what.  People kept coming up and asking us things we had already told the last waiter who'd visited us......strange.  The only other issue I have is the napkins are paper.  When you are eating pizza at a kinda fancy joint,  it is my belief you should have cloth napkins.  But again, maybe I'm being picky.

  The food, however, was absolutely wonderful.  We ordered an antipasto plate which was great,  a salad with chick pea dressing, awesome croutons, Pecorino Romano and parsnips.  Out of this world!  Our second salad had pears, honey, more romano cheese, and roasted almonds tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.
  My dad, the pasta freak, ordered a simple thick spaghetti-like pasta, fresh and not available every day.  It had browned butter and black pepper and herbs on it.  He was very happy.    The rest of us split 2 pizzas.  The simple Margherita, just sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil.  (They forgot to put the basil on the pizza however and had to bring us a cup full).  The other pizza was the Tartufata, a white pizza with prosciutto, mozzarella, mushrooms and drizzled with truffle oil.  We fought over the the last piece!  

  Seeing as it was my sister in law's birthday, they brought a crepe filled with chocolate which tasted like a big chocolate chip cookie.  I've never been that big of a fan of the crepe but everyone took a few bites.  There was also a jazz trio playing on the patio and even though they were a bit loud at times, we were not seated close to them and they did a version of a Radiohead song which I appreciated.

  So, a bit of a pain in the ass logistically and service wise.  (They do have valet parking)  But the food is absolutely awesome.  If they would just get some club soda and those cloth napkins.....",0,0,2

That's the word that popped into my head after a wonderful evening at Cibo. A motley group of friends met up for dinner and left very, very happy. 

We met around 7pm at Cibo. We were immediately seated at the front of the house next to the bar. The bartender was our waiter and he was super friendly and very helpful. We decided to each order a pizza so that plates could be passed around and pizzas shared! I'm glad that was what the decision was because I tried several different pizzas that night. 

The server was very helpful in selecting the wine that I chose to drink that night. He asked me what I liked to drink as far as American standards and suggested great Italian wines. He even came to suggest certain pizzas as well as aperitifs! 

I ordered the Bruschetta... it was delicious. The entire table enjoyed that appetizer. Once the main meals arrived, we realized that appetizers weren't needed. 

For my meal I ordered the Prosciutto Crudo. The dough was well cooked but not too hard that you could take a good chewy\/smoky bite out of it. There were plenty of toppings and everything was high quality. I was amazed! 

At the end of the meal we just HAD to indulge in the crepes. I chose the Nutella and chocolate crepe....heaven. Of course I shared and everyone agreed that the crepe was amazing. 

To finish our dining experience off, we indulged in aperitifs of Lemoncello and some kind of yummy chocolate liqueur. 

Of course from start to finish I was happy. Our service was spot on, the food was FANTASTIC, and the drinks were wonderful. It was fate that our crew hit that spot right then, right there... I honestly do not have one complaint, one criticism, one bad thing to say about Cibo.

These are just some of the awards that Cibo has won.
Well, this year, Cibo is being awarded its most prestigious award to date. 
And that is the Craig R's Favorite Dinner While Visiting Arizona Award 

Cibo, which is located in a residential neighborhood in Phoenix, is actually an old restored 1913 bungalow. The inside of Cibo has hardwood floors, beautiful stained glass paneling, an all wood bar and a fireplace. Since it was such a warm, beautiful Phoenix evening, my fiancé and I decided to dine in the front yard of Cibo, which is covered with tables, Christmas lights and a fire pit. Cibo also has local Jazz bands come in and play live music in the front yard, which gives Cibo a super relaxing and romantic vibe. In fact, this was one of the most romantic evenings my fiancé and I have shared in a long time. 

To start out the night we shared their famous Burrata appetizer, which tends to sell out every night. The Burrata consisted of fresh mozzarella topped with a balsamic glaze, black label prosciutto crudo and toasted bread. This app was extremely flavorful and fun to eat. I can see why it sells out almost every night. The mozzarella was really creamy and had an awesome sweet and tangy flavor because of the balsamic glaze. When you combine all the elements of this dish together you get this awesome little sandwich that is sweet, tangy and salty all at the same time.  

Cibo is known for their homemade wood fire pizza's that they prepare with only locally grown organic produce and imported Italian products. Every pizza on their menu sounded amazing so my fiancé and I each ordered a different one so we could share them. These are the pizza's we got: 

Diavola- Tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy salami, and Italian sausage 
Tartufata- Mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and truffle oil. I also added Italian sausage and ricotta cheese.  

Both of these pizzas were phenomenal. They were both huge and cooked perfectly so the crust was thin and crispy, with slightly burnt edges. The spicy salami on the Diavola was actually really, really spicy. The tomato sauce on this pie was extremely flavorful too. The Tartufata  was really cheesy since it contained both mozzarella and ricotta cheese. The truffle oil and the white mushrooms that were on this pizza gave it such an amazing taste. 

The service at Cibo was top notch. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive. Since we had never been there before she was very helpful in explaining their menu and giving us suggestions on what we should try and what some of their most popular dishes are. She also always made sure our drinks were always full and that we had everything we needed. 
The prices at Cibo were good too. Their pizzas range anywhere from $12 to $15 dollars a piece, which is great considering how big and delicious they were.

There is a small lot behind the restaurant. They were busy on a Sunday evening but service was great anyway. Our waitress helped us with our wine selection and we decided on the burrata and calamari appetizers.
- burrata app - delicious and recommended! Came with crunchy pieces of toast, burrata with balsamic vinegar, heirloom tomatoes with arugula and prosciutto.. can't go wrong with this one 
- calamari app -just ok.. not going to rave about this one
- calzone - the bread was soft and had char from the oven.. prosciutto coto, salame, mozzarella, ricotta filling was good too.. we also added mushrooms.. a solid choice

The staff were nice and fairly attentive. It's got a nice laid back vibe. 

We started off with a Caprese salad and I think that's why I rated this place just average. For me an Italian restaurant shouldn't ruin a caprese salad but this one was just not good. Something was seriously missing - maybe a little balsamic drizzle but it lacked all of the fresh flavors I was hoping for. The pizza I ordered on the other hand was so good. I was really bummed I couldn't bring the rest home (headed to a concert after dinner). It was the Di Norte and had a nice kick to it so you if you like a little spice in your life this is the thing to order.

Topping the list one has to mention, in no particular order; Grimandis, Humble Pie, Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco.
From home made mozzarella , to organic sourdough and the most expensive state of the art lava and wood burning ovens, eating pizza  here in Phoenix is a serious thing.
As a  full blooded Italian,, I have to say one thing; I do not like pizza.....I lOVE IT.
And with the company of my wife, I have made an effort to try and flavor every pizza establishment in the valley.The results have been outstanding and the experiences  worth writing in my pizza diaries.
But as in beauty and love (and pizza) I guess one has to deal with subjectivity. We all have different tastes and preferences,  so when it comes to choosing the best pizza, we try to stick with originality in flavor and  the consistency of its dough..  and while trying them all, I have found exquisite flavors and combinations, different dough textures created by each unique oven, and one particular pie that distinguishes itself from all of the others  because of its simplicity and originality.
And in my eternal quest to find the most original pizza, that is the one that most closely resembles the true pizza........the one that originated in the 1830s in Napoli, baked in an oven built with lava rocks from mount Vesubio,  I have to mention two contenders; CIBO and Pizzeria Bianco.
For 15 years, Pizzeria Bianco located at 623 E Adams  street in downtown Phoenix, has been a favorite amongst pizza aficionados for making pizzas that truly resemble  a pizzeria Napolitana.
Owner, Chris Bianco , decided that the only way to create an authentic pizza, was to travel to the place of its origin, Napoli, and learn the art of pizza making.  His internship paid well and today when one eats at his pizzeria, there is no doubt that his pizzas are a very close duplicate of what one would get in Napoli.
Not even a mile apart, one finds another jewel in the pizza arena; CIBO Pizzeria.  Cibo translate simply into"" the food"". If you are a true pizza aficionado, you must try this pizzeria in order to truly understand the art in the making of truly artisan pizza.
Karen and Tony Martingiglio are the owners of this small and charming old house located at 603 5th ave in downtown Phoenix. It resembles a true Italian osteria.( an Italian eatery where local wines are flavored and where people come to have a great time with friends and eat home made dishes) Friendly, charming, and warm, Cibo  makes you feel at home eating with your mamma.
Pizzas here are crafted by a true transplanted pizza maker from Napoli; artisan Guido Saccone.

Pizza Margherita is probably an exact copy of what one would expect to eat in Napoli.  From the chewy lightly burned dough relieved with bubbling volcanoes,  to the simple earthy  tomato sauce and fresh basil, this pizza is heavenly.
And if I was placed in the predicament of choosing my favorite, I  would undoubtedly pick Cibo; after all there is an authentic  artisan from Napoli crafting these wonderful pies.",1,0,0

Most of us shared pizzas & they were excellent! Real mozzarella, tasty red sauce & fresh ingredients. One of the girls had the wood board mixture of meats, cheeses, veggies & fruits. It was such a huge plate that it could have fed the entire table of 9 as a nice appetizer.

I really like the atmosphere at Cibo. I was gonna say it's a ""cute little place"" because that's how it feels, but I think it's a lot bigger than it actually appears (as I was leaving I noticed that the patio really does have a lot of seating). It seems like there's a lot of separate little rooms each with a few tables, which I kind of like because even though this place gets busy you still can carry on a conversation with your party without feeling like you have to shout over loud noise. 

As for food, I can honestly say the calzone I had was one of (if not THE) best I ever had. I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to calzones, but the one at Cibo isn't quite as ""heavy"" compared to most places (the crust surrounding the cheese & meats is thinner), but it's HUGE & very filling. The lighter crust (& cheese) doesn't make you feel like there's a huge rock in your gut when you're finished even thought you just finished something so mammoth (and yes, I did finish my calzone). The other people I was with all had pizzas & they all found them to be yummy. I should note (and I'm pointing out my own stupidity here), the calzone at Cibo is listed on the menu w\/the pizzas (they only have one calzone listed). The pizzas at Cibo all have special Italian sounding names. I actually thought I was ordering a pizza called the ""calzone"" and planned on sharing it w\/the others in my party who were all sharing pizzas. I was a little surprised when I got an ACTUAL calzone (I know, silly me). Anyway, my friends had more than enough pizza to share with each other and I ate the whole calzone myself!

My friends ordered a couple of desserts, which I didn't plan on trying, but decided when in Rome, why not! I had a couple of the donut ball things dipped in nutella (sorry, don't know what they're actually called), and they were heaven. A couple other friends split whatever the crepe w\/fresh fruit & whipped cream is called, and well, I probably ate at least half of it. So, yeah...

So yes, of course after 700+ reviews, you're going to know the product is amazing. It just IS. I've not yet subjected myself to the wait of Bianco but I can't imagine it's leaps and bounds better than Cibo. Cibo is dreamy.

First off: I want to plan a fantasy fairy wedding party in their front courtyard on a cool spring night. It's just so cute and perfect! The twinkle lights and the wrought iron and the fountains and everything is awesome. Too bad both times we've been there it was approx 48403 degrees out. Sometime soon.

Second off: The food is just sublime. What I've partaken in...

- Sardegna salad - ""baby spinach topped with goat cheese, carmelized walnuts, and sliced strawberries with prosecco dressing"" The salad was dressed lightly, the walnuts were plentiful, the strawberries were JUICEAAAAY! A perfect way to start a lunch (along with a glass of bubbly)

-Genova pizza - ""mozzarella, homemade basil pesto, roasted potatoes, white onions and grated parmigiano"" HELLO, YES, I LOVE YOU. I saw a few reviews wishing the potatoes were thinly sliced, rather than the small cubes, but it just seemed perfect to me. The gooey fresh mozz and pesto were the perfect blanket of taste under the potatoes and onion. The crust is wood-fired perfection

-Their take on the Margherita: Simple and classic. That's all there is to say. Mine had the perfect amount of basil and again, the charred underneath of the crust was on point.

So why 4 and not 5 stars if the food and ambiance seems so flawless? I just got the sense (on both visits) that the staff just didn't care to be there. I understand, late lunch is kind of annoying time to be working, especially on the weekends. But I mean...on our second trip our server came to our table chewing on a mouthful of food. What? Wait times just seem a LITTLE steep., especially with only one or two other tables occupied at both times. One time we got bread, one time we did not. I just wish things were a little more streamlined and a little more careful. I love places that let the staff be laid-back and casual...as long as their job is done. You know? 

In any case, it certainly won't stop us from visiting again. The food is too good to not! We'll make sure to make our next trip a dinner event in normal dinner times to see if things shape up just a few tiny notches in order to bump them up to 5 stars!",2,0,0

The pizza was good, though there were many spots the cheese didn't cover.  It was hardly a problem however, as the crust is extremely flavorful.  The vegetable toppings were cooked to perfection.

The bruschetta was good, though I'm not too sure about the beans.  It's a personal preference, but it was just too many beans.  The tomato was very good.

Ask them to add some cheesy mozzarella goodness if your a fan like me : -)  It is one of the best sammiches you'll find around the Metro.  For a lighter lunch but just as filling go for one of the awesome salads;  The Capri, or the Couscous salad or my fave the Mele ~ organic mixed greens topped with chopped chicken, walnuts, apples, blue cheese and an apple vinaigrette dressing = yum-fest!! 

For dinner, start with a either their grilled veggies or the antipasto special; meat and cheeses!  Both are wonderful!  Have fun choosing a pizza!! They are all too good for me to mention one over the others.  Seriously!! Just save some room for one of the Nutella crepes!!  They a couple of different ones to choose from ~ they are a super way to wrap up a wonderful meal!!

Restaurant~  This place is loads of fun yet it is somewhat romantic too! Sit outside and enjoy their terace - patio when the weather permits. It's a wonderful setting and a great place to have fun convo with a date or with friends.  Their indoor seating is also wonderful.  There's not a bad seat in this place.  The service is excellent!! They are very attentive, they know their menu items and help even the pickiest eater find something they would like!!

It's pretty close, though. And when you factor in wait times (15 minutes on a First Friday night at 7pm), parking (much better, being on the west side of downtown), and leftovers (the pizza crust holds up remarkably well under microwaving), it's really no question.

We started with the burrata, and I really can't recommend this enough: two mountains of creamy, fresh mozzarella, sliced prosciutto that melts in your mouth, and toasted bread that's just soft enough to keep from dicing the roof of your mouth. The only problem was, by the end of it (and we scraped every bit of cheese up) we were hardly hungry. Between the two pizzas we ordered between my wife, me, and our daughter, we finished less than half. From now on, we'll go with the burrata, and split a pie...though then we'd miss out on the leftovers. I'll have to rethink this.

A few minor quibbles: it'd be nice of the beers were on tap. My Lagunitas IPA wasn't quite cold enough. Also, the main entrance is a tight fit, but it's worth it for the ambiance, I think.

Beyond that, though, everything about Cibo, from the food to the charming owners, was exceptional. I only half-jested that I'd like to go back today.",4,2,3

I could eat their pizza everyday. The hot olive oil is definitely a wonderful add to the pizza, just ask for it. 
The atmosphere is quite refreshing. I very much prefer to sit outside, weather permitting. Especially having little children they can get a little rowdy inside and they echo. I also think the seating inside is a little tight. Especially with a larger group more than five. Which is why we really like the outside seating. Sometimes still a little close depending on where you are seated but less likely to notice the noise level on the group we always have.

Grab yourself a nice glass of wine, pair it with an assortment of exceptional cheeses, and have a seat for this glorious experience. 

We walked into Cibo, were immediately greeted by the hostess; she was very welcoming, a smile on her face, sat us within a few minutes of our arrival. Then, boys and girls came our waiter, Ross. He had a smile on his face, seemed welcoming, however, the freshly smoked cigarette odor lingering off of him was extremely unpleasant. Restaurant dining is meant to excite your senses; sight, smell, taste, touch. I mean, there is nothing like, here is your glass of iced tea, with my cigarette fingers all over it.

We were a table of 4, we all ordered our individual dinners, three ordered salads, as an appetizer, in addition to their dinner. Out came their salad AND my dinner. Wait, why is my dinner coming out with their salad you ask? Not quite sure kids. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen. I asked a different staff member to take back my meal, as the rest of the parties dinner had not arrived at the table, and that they were just served their salad. The look of bewildered confusion came upon her face. She took back my dinner, and out came our waiter, Ross telling me that ""it would be five minutes tops"" before the rest of my parties dinner came out if I can just leave my hot sandwich in front of me until their food came out. Well, fifteen minutes went by, their dinner never appeared. We asked Ross to take back my dinner, as it was now cold, also because the rest of the parties dinner has yet to come out. During this wait, the parties dinner came out, with mine in the abyss of the kitchen. Almost fifteen minutes went by, my dinner never made it out of the kitchen. I asked Ross for the manager. She came to the table, with a smirk on her face. I told her what is going on. Wait for this.... she did not even apologize, or offer to make it right. She stood there with her smirky face, saying something about the way the kitchen works. Not my problem. During all of this banter, my dinner finally made its way to the table. The manager never offered to make the situation right. 

Listen, I was not looking to have been offered anything for free, or have my meal comped. I just wanted my dinner at the same time the rest of my party was eating their dinner. I did not want to sit and eat my dinner, while they are eating their appetizer. A simple sincere apology would have made it better. 

Needless to say, we will never again step one foot into this establishment. As a paying customer, there are plenty of options for dining in this city. I get better customer service at my local grocery store then I did in this restaurant. We have rented the Carriage House for a company Christmas party, I promise you this, they have lost all future business. We work hard for our money, and it will never again be spent at Cibo. 

To the manager; not sure what your name is, you need to educate yourself on proper customer service etiquette. The way you treated me was horrendous and extremely unprofessional. You never made it right. You never even returned back to our table after our dinner was finally served, just to ask how everything was. Shame on you.

The pizza here is crisp and delicious, and I really enjoy their sandwich creations! They use very high quality meat (and yes, I'm a mostly vegetarian!), and the ciabatta bread is to die for! 

This place is great if you are looking to spend all night drinking wine and eating great food with friends, if you are celebrating something special, or if you just want a tasty lunch! Parking is fairly straightforward here. And also, big kudos to the staff who have always been very friendly and attentive!",4,1,1

When you approach the entrance, you get a good feeling, unlike the rest of the overly bright, pretentious, ubiquitous strip-mall restaurants around the valley. No, this is a house, surrounded by other houses in a real neighborhood - so the setting is beautiful.

Now the food:

We started with the bruschetta. Outstanding. I think while we were eating it our eyes were rolling back in our head! I had a Lagunitas IPA, it's nice to see they have a good IPA to complement their Fatta in Casa cuisine. 

We move along to the infamous pizza (though the pasta specials were tantalizing - but had to try the pizza since it's my first time here). We ordered the Diavola with ricotta cheese. This pizza took me back to Trastevere in Rome. Crust was tasty, browned with a slight char, but not too much. Sauce was fresh but not watery, and the cheese was delicious. And though we were both full after a couple of pieces, we could not stop eating it.

Of course we had to try the dessert ( Nutella desserts will always be a winner). We split the Nutella Crepe and each had a cappuccino - and no dirty looks from the waiter when ordering a cappuccino after dinner in America! Delicious, a great way to end the evening.

I will travel from Chandler to Cibo any night of the week because this is a place that does it right. I almost never give 5 stars on a first time visit, but this wasn't a ""lucky"" night. Everything was top quality with genuine care and love put into it and that was quite evident. Bravo!

Grazie mille per una bella notte! Ci vediamo presto!",3,0,2

Well good news and bad news. The good news is I had a class near this place so I went there for lunch finally. The bad news? It was just okay, talk about a big let down. 

First, the good is the excellent atmosphere. The place is just beautiful and the setting is in a nice and quiet neighborhood that you never thought is Phoenix. Luckily the weather is gorgeous at this time of year and the servers were very nice. You just can't beat the atmosphere, it is a great place to take out of town guest to impress just make sure they don't expect the same from the food. 

The food, Now to be fair, I do not know where all these wood buring or what I call rustic pizza craze is coming from. From grimaldis to lagrande orange to other places like these, their crust are just awful from my point of view. I use to live in Chicago and those were real crust that you can actually see and taste and feel the textures in your mouth from the buttery thick crust to the crispy and light thin crust. All I can ever feel are just the toppings, the crust is paper thin with no texture or taste. Please the outside crust don't count, who eats that with the ingredients huh? Well all I can say is that if it is thin crust, it should be nice and crispy, not barely able to hold up the pizza that you have to eat it with a fork. 

I have to say their ingredients is top notch and the salami was excellent on the Davoda pizza. Else everything was alright, the sauce was good, but not the best I have had by far. Beside that there is nothing to judge off really in a pizza, crust, toppings and sauce really is all. It was average, but again, next time that  I have outside visitors from out of state, definitely taking them here to enjoy the atmosphere.",0,0,0

As soon as we got there the excitement turned to disappointment.  My husband and I decided on a last minute date night when I get off work.  I had been looking at this on yelp and it was on my list.  We went last night, Sunday, and got there about 8 pm (they closed at 9 pm).

First we walked in, was not sure where to go since it was out first time.  Someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.  So we waited..and waited.  About 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.  We asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.  She was annoyed that the table she sat us at was directly against a bench which I kept hitting my elbow on.  We asked to move (there were a lot of tables) which annoyed her even more.  About 15 minutes later our server showed up (granted now the close in 30 minutes).  We asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...never saw those the whole meal.  She came to the table for our order and stated they only had 4 pizza's left so if we wanted pizza we needed to order immediately.  Since we had never been there, looking at the menu for 3-4 minutes was not enough time, but we wanted pizza.  We got a pepperoni like pizza and a sausage and potato white pizza.  We also ordered calamari as a appetizer.  

When the food came out, all of it came at once.  This is my biggest pet peeve of restaurants!!  Appetizers come before a meal...not with it!  The calamari was nothing to talk about...frozen and bland.  The best thing about it was that we got the lemons with is, so we used those in our water.  The pizzas came out at the same time...again nothing great.  The crust was actually delicious, but there was hardly any cheese on them at all.  We asked for parm cheese, never got that either.  On the potato pizza the potatoes were still hard (under cooked) so we peeled them all off.  The pepperoni was okay, just needed more cheese.  The crust was the best part of the pizza.  

The food was okay...the service was horrible (never got what we asked for, drinks empty whole meal, and rushed to get everything since it was close to closing).  I think with this experience we will not come back here.  We drove over 30 minutes to try this place and it was a disappointment.  I know there are a lot of good reviews, but this is my view, which is not great.",2,0,0

Every time I go, as I'm sitting, devouring what I have proclaimed ""might be my favorite pizza, ever."", I commit to reviewing Cibo, but somehow, in my post-pizza bliss, I forget.  Not this time!  Time to give credit where credit is due.

Cibo is 100% adorable... the repurposed old house, the charming patio, the live music in the evenings.... just adorable.  It's small(ish) but I think that's part of it's charm.  Somehow we've been lucky and never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated, even on Friday and Saturday evenings.  (By the way... this is one of the main reasons I prefer Cibo over the highly-touted Pizzaria Bianco).  

Antipasti-- I've had both the pear salad and the caprese salad and both are delicious.  Of the two, the pear salad is my favorite-- the honey adds an interesting element that compliments the rest of the salad nicely.  

Pizza- La Noce is what I'm referring to as ""might be my favorite pizza, ever."".  I love the flavor of the arugula, ricotta, and walnuts-- and the red sauce is perfect.-- an interesting blend of flavors that just works I've also tried the Pomodoro Fresco-- also delicious, but La Noce is still my favorite.  Others I've eaten with have ordered other pizzas as well and all have proclaimed them fabulous. The crust is perfectly done, thin without being soggy.  

Service- The service is reliably good-- not amazing or remarkable, but good.  No issues here.

For the pizza we ordered the Di Notte - fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola and mozzerella cheese topped with spicy salami. It was some of the best pizza that I have ever in my life had. The light char on the bottom of the pizza (which reminded me of the exterior of a marshmallow when you hold it over a campfire) just set it off.

From what I understand it is goats milk cheese that is flown in fresh daily and they have limited quantities. To say this is like butter is an understatement. It was delicious!!!!! Next I ordered the Rustica which is mozzarella, topped with prosciutto crudo and arugula after pizza is cooked. It took everything in me not to eat the entire damn pizza. Dottsy ordered the Prosciutto Crudo which is similar except hers has red sauce and no arugula. My goodness. I am still shaking my head and kicking myself for giving Dottsy all the leftovers.

In a nutshell - the most underwhelming and flavorless meal we've had in a very long time. We should have anticipated what kind of meal this was going to be, by the dirty side plates brought to our table.

We had the Ostia salad - ""Romaine hearts tossed with our homemade chick pea dressing, topped with oven roasted herbed croutons, shaved pecorino romano, crispy parsnips and black pepper."" Our romaine lettuce was spoiled, and rotting, the dressing had absolutely  ZERO flavor, and the salad overall just generally lacked any flavor at all. We then had the Procida pizza -""Mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, asian pears, chopped arugula, goat cheese and black pepper."" It wasn't bad, but it was just - eh. Again, lacked flavor. The goat cheese had no flavor whatsoever. 

Our service was fine, but the girl who cleared our plates was very unprofessional. We let her know (and showed her) our rotted salad leaves, and she just replied with - ""Oh...sorry."" That was it. Also, as she was clearing our plates, she put others' dirty plates on our table as she tried to stack ours. At that point, we knew our complaint was going to fall on deaf ears. 

We've been to just about every pizza joint in the valley, and this was subpar, to say the least. I have no idea what all the hullaballoo is all about. We will definitely not be going back, which is disappointing, because we truly had high hopes for Cibo's after all the amazing reviews.",2,1,0

I really enjoy introducing people to places they have never been, and I am happy to say Cibo recently gained two new fans of their charming outdoor patio and good food.

The three of us arrived just before the 5pm opening to ensure we could secure a table on the patio and enjoy the gorgeous first evening of Spring outside.  Everything we tried was fantastic, and I had the opportunity to sample two new-to-me dishes, the burrata appetizer (I have no words to describe how special and good this mozzarella is, especially when combined with the salty prosciutto, and a drizzle of aged basalmic) and dessert!       

After selecting a chianti and the burrata, we decided to share two pizzas among us - the margherita and the rustica.  Both were excellent, with that slightly doughy wood-fired crust I love so much.

Ah, the dessert.  I think the trick to getting dessert with any meal is dining with guys.  There is no dainty ""oh no, I just couldn't eat another bite"" but rather ""which one do you want?"".  I like that.  We chose the Nutella and Marscapone cheese crepe, which was topped with a light dusting of powdered sugar and chocolate sauce.  So good, so worth waiting for - like hot chocolate, but on a plate.  Manners and politeness went out the door as our three forks fought for position.  I believe insults were thrown.  It is all fun and games until you get between me and some warm Nutella.  Back away slowly and you won't get hurt...  ;)",9,8,9

I got the Lunch Di Notte Pizza and it was delicious. Buttery cheese, salty, and sweet. If you drizzle it with some olive oil it's perfection! The crust is charred wonderfully and there's just something about this place that makes you happy every time you take a bite. Great flavors. Simple and not overpowering.

You don't need to order anything else for lunch, it was the perfect portion to make me feel satisfied.

It is a small walk from downtoan but I would not recommend making the hike in the summer as I did last year.  Too long and too hot for the same quality pizza that you can get closer to downtown.

We normally get gluten free pizzas that have a thin cracker-like crust that is at best ""OK"" in my opinion.  I am a bread lover and I really appreciate a great brick oven fired pizza with a big crispy crust.  In my limited experience, all of the gluten free crusts don't even have this.  This is the exception everybody!!  This tasted just as good if not better than most pizzas that I have had.  We had a rendition of their vegetarian pizza with added olives and oh man, it was SO good.  The waitress told us that the gluten free flour was imported from Italy and the owner of Cibo (as I understood it) went the great lengths to ensure that the crust was just right before releasing it.

Perhaps the crowd had thinned out some, but we were seated inside in the right-hand side room. The ambiance was great. Our server was friendly, informative, and attentive. My friends and I got a great bottle of wine and some appetizers. The pizza I got was the special of the night: pesto with grape tomatoes, baked and then topped with slowly melting boccincini mozzarella balls and pine nuts. It was excellent. A huge fave. I left a big fan and raved about it to other friends of mine. 

A return trip was in order. But this time all went wrong. Really wrong. Our waitress was a complete space cadet who didn't once tell us what the specials were and would disppear at odd times, raising our tweak alert. We were seated at the same table as last time, but this time the side room was full and so damn loud that we were straining to hear ourselves talk. Everyone at the other tables decided to compensate for the noise by raising their voices and thus making things even worse. So, to say the least, we were stuck in an endless cyclone of noise, getting stronger and stronger by the minute - fueled by all the hot, loud earsplitting air being exhaled by 20 people. We were miserable. We ordered a margherita, a quattro fromaggi, a proscuitto, and a sausage pizza. Three of the four came back with the crusts completely charred. I don't mind a little burn here and there - I like the crust a little crunchy, but this was ridiculous. Not helped that the waitress was serving our pizzas by reaching over the table and putting her arms smack in front of our faces. Talk about disappointment, and a shot-down credibility on my part because I took three friends who expected great things.

So I've got two trips to Cibo's which ended up on the opposite ends of the spectrum, even though I sat at the exact same table. Thus the three stars is an average of the two. Don't know if it's worth another go around. Maybe on a slow weeknight when tweaker chick is off tweaking elsewhere. 

Too bad. The co-owner knew it, too, when she hesitatingly asked us how that second night went. I wish I could have said ""Great"" but I had to be honest. I could see the disappointment on her face, but hey, still not as disappointed as me.",3,3,2

We were looking to have lunch after going to the science museum with the kids and my handy dandy yelp app lead us here.   Loved the space! No pizza at lunch, just paninis with the same ingredients as on the pizzas. They don't have a kids menu but my kids are fine ordering from adult menus with some adaptations, of course, and our requests were honored with no problems. We all loved our sandwiches!

We are big fans of crepes so of course we had to have dessert.  The kids got the crepe with the vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce which they devoured.

I have to chalk it up to going both times during lunch, when they don't serve pizza, because people seem to be crazy for the pizza here, but everything I've had at this place just plain sucks. From a mushy ""meatball"" sandwich that played more like an Italian sloppy joe to the criminally dry, flavorless salad topped stingily with tiny, cold chunks of bland chicken. I don't have any good words for any of the entrees I have tried here and nothing my companions ordered looked especially appealing either.

Oh cool! They start you out with some bread on a cutting board. Ask them for butter though, and you'll be informed that they don't have any. No butter! A restaurant that is devoid of butter. Let me talk about this for a second. First of all, I don't believe it, so just right there, I think you're lying to me. Saying ""our policy is to not give our customers butter when they ask for it"" doesn't sound so good though, so I understand. The service was otherwise acceptable, if not terribly friendly.

If you ask me, and I know I'm only one small voice amid a chorus of four and five star reviews, this place is long on atmosphere and location and short on everything else. Expensive prices for the stingy portions of mediocre food. I don't even know if I'll go back for the pizza.",5,4,0

It was unseasonably cold, so we ate inside--if the weather is warm, I'd recommend eating outside under the lights.  There were plenty of people outside braving the 50 degree weather, as there are heat lamps there.  We were told the house that holds the restaurant is 100 years old!

We had three pizzas: Rustica, Vegetarina, and the Funghi.  Our six year old had the individual margarita pizza.  We also had two of the house garden salads; a large is good for two people.  Started with the risotto balls and the meatballs.  Everything was excellent, although the risotto balls were a bit bland.  Pizza crust was perfect--crunchy on the outside with a bit of char from the wood fired oven.

Just a nice setting, cool older building, busy hip crowd, and great pizza that comes super hot and fresh out of the oven. 

Only reason I am giving this a 4 star is that our service was slow.  I didn't mind too much since it was so busy and I was with great people, but it took about 20 minutes from when I asked for the check to when I was able to sign and walk away, despite me putting the credit card down immediately.

We were also happy to find that they carry Deschute's Fresh Squeezed IPA which is by far one of our favorite beers. For the food, we had lasagna, the meat & cheese board, a mixed salad, several types of pizza, and nutella crepes as a final treat! Basically, we were absolutely STUFFED by the time we left, but it was because the food was so good we wanted to keep eating it even after reaching the full point haha. I can't speak much to the cost of things, since again we were lucky enough to have all of our drinks & food taken care of by the hosts, but I can absolutely say that we will be giving Cibo another try for an upcoming date night!",0,0,0

Now, I've had pizza in Italy and Cibo isn't as good as that, however, it is some of the best I've had since Italy and was reminiscent of what I've had there. We came here on Wednesday night and the patio was packed and since we were pretty hungry we decided to not wait and just sit inside. I gotta say, it's a very cute place. I loved the decor, it felt very quaint and homey. The service wasn't the greatest, as our waiter was rather short with us and not too friendly.  The dessert did take a long time to get to us, but really we weren't too bothered by these things as the overall experience was a positive one.

Now, down to the good stuff... the food. My Husband and I shared a margherita pizza and a spicy salami white pizza. The margherita was to die for and the spicy salami was great with a nice kick. My favorite part of their pizza is the crust. It's is so flavorful and has great chewy and crispy texture. My sister had the special gnocchi, which was really good too. At the end we all shared the nutella and marscapone crepe, which was utter bliss. 

The prices were good, the food was awesome, the ambiance was delightful... we'll be back!",0,0,0

Located in a house with a spacious front patio, the interior encompassed a full bar area, breakout dining rooms, hardwood floors, and red brick walls. A friendly staff, constant foot traffic, and opportunities for people watching added to the festive, home-like atmosphere. I came here for dinner with a group of five that included fellow Yelpers Fia R, and Kurdy S, and decided to order antipasti and two pizzas to share. 

For antipasti, we went with the server's recommendation and ordered the Burrata ($14). The platter came with fresh mozzarella, balsamic drizzles, razor thin prosciutto, and toasted bread. I was impressed by the mozzarella, as it was light, airy, flavorful, and easy to spread across the warm crusty bread. The gentle flavors between the balsamic and prosciutto went hand in hand, as they complemented the mozzarella and bread without hindering it. This is a must get for those visiting for the first time. 

Next, we shared the half Diavola and half Magherita Pizza ($13). The Diavola was pleasantly spicy, as the pizza was inspired by the centrality of spicy salame embedded in mozzarella and tomato sauce. I also enjoyed the Margherita, as the light tasting tomato sauce, mozzarella, and fresh basil were spot on delicious. One noteworthy limitation regarding their pizza was the soft crust. It had a nice flavor but the texture was also flimsy and unexpected. 

Finally, we shared a half Procida and half Tartufata Pizza ($14). The Procida came with mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, Asian pears, chopped arugula, goat cheese and black pepper. The goat cheese flavor was very sharp, so I didn't particularly enjoy it as much as the other finesse tasting pizzas. The Tartufata arrived with mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and white truffle oil drizzles. I enjoyed the smoky flavor stemming from the pizza, but the combination of strong-flavored white truffle oil and cheese didn't go particularly well for me. 

3.5 stars. Overall, it was a delicious meal with plenty to rave about. I suggest interested diners to be aware of possible long waits, especially for those arriving later in the evening. Additionally, I also would not suggest this place to those who have a strong preference for thin, crispy crust pizzas. Their desserts were also limited to crepes, which we didn't care for on that particular evening. I must say, the place is great for dates, but the noise level can be pretty loud. Despite these limitations, our water was constantly refilled, and we were attended to frequently without much interruption. It was a great way to start a new journey in Phoenix. I hope to find the perfect crust in the area before coming back.",26,23,26

We were seated quickly on their lovely patio. It was a gorgeous night and the ambiance was absolutely perfect. Our server admited to being a bit overwhelmed but still managed to give us prompt, humorous, and personable service.

Took the hubster for his first time last night and was slightly worried it may not live up to how much I had hyped it up. Sometimes restaurants, over the years, stop paying attention to detail and loose their oomph. Omg. Not Cibo. Everything was so delicious. We had the pesto salad to start. A little bland for my taste, but very fresh tasting and the fried potatoes, while a little weird sounding in a salad, added a yum savoriness. Hubby loved it. We then ordered the Diavola pizza and the Tartufata. We are both big time red sauce believers. Very rarely will we order a pizza that doesn't have red sauce. The Diavola had a fresh delicious crushed tomato sauce that was just perfect. The spicy salami was perfect, not greasy or too fatty tasting (which I still love but maybe more on a charcuterie). The Tartufata was the white pizza. Mushrooms, procuitto, mozzarella... and... truffle oil. TRUFFLE.OIL. Omg. So good. Both pizzas' crust was perfect. To end the super healthy feast, we decided we would go out with a bang and get the mascarpone and Nutella crepe with ice cream (because obv). Life changing. The mascarpone smooths out the Nutella perfectly. Not too sweet, but still rich. Anyway, I want another crepe for breakfast and if Cibo was closer right now, I would order two.

There are too many different styles, preferences and expectations for comparing different pizza places. That being said, if you're looking for the ""artisanal"" style of pizza (small, relatively thin crust, simple but flavorful toppings, fired in a very hot wood oven), Cibo is a winner.

I love trying different pizza places (usually limiting myself to artisanal or new york style), and, for me the trinity of pizza perfection in Phoenix is Cibo, Bianco, and La Grande Orange (and NYPD if I need a lot of pizza). Bianco is great, but has long lines; La Grande Orange is a bit heavy on the toppings, but Cibo seems to get things just right for me.

Their crusts are flavorful, chewy around the outside, with just a slight bit of charring. However, the crust could stand to have a bit more structure toward the middle of the pizza (the crust will go limp if there are too many toppings). The toppings are fresh, flavorful, and of obviously high quality. If you want a pizza that is comparable to the legendary Bianco pizzas, Cibo is an excellent choice.

For dessert, try the strawberry (or banana) nutella crepes. The ambiance is great both inside and out, although the inside can get a bit loud. Also note that they allow you to order their pizza for pick-up.",1,0,1

My wife and I felt pretty bad, after hyping Cibo up to friends for the past couple weeks, only to be treated fairly strangely and shabbily by our waiter. We were the only two in our group who had been there before, and luckily the only ones embarrassed when things did not go as smoothly as we would've hoped.

Our large party would agree that the food and the atmosphere are still top notch, as are the wines and that delicious homemade limoncello... But the service just fell off, due to one person in particular. Read Nader A's review for the full story, but the gist of it is there was a (rude) miscommunication on the waiter's part, and he was so steadfast (attitude) about not admitting his mistake that it cost him any additional tip he might have received. He also chose to do this at peak volume coinciding with the entertainer's break, so not only did everyone at our table get an earful, but so did the surrounding patrons. it was like a scene in a movie when a bunch of people who do not belong walk into the wrong bar and the needle scratches right off the record. To Nader A's credit, he remained cool, but the damage was done. Later on we found out that our waiter also dissuaded others at the table from customizing their pizzas because ""they are perfect the way they are."" I don't know if he had something else going on and decided to take it out on us, but to snap at us the way he did was truly unacceptable.

We were planning on having the table sample some of Cibo's delicious crepes for dessert, and I'm positive we would have certainly drank a bit more as well, but instead we chose to leave early and take our business elsewhere. Will we be back? Eventually, but in all honesty not anytime soon, and definitely not in that guy's section.

I definitely enjoyed the pizza. It's a tasty thin crust and the sausage topping had a lot of flavor. However, I did not like the calzone very much. The inside did not seem cooked like it should be.

It really depends on the style of pizza you like.  I don't like pizza that is really more bread based than sauce based.  The sauce makes or breaks a pizza for me.  The pizza here doesn't use a lot of sauce or cheese.  If you are a fan of good crust you may love this place but it is not my cup of tea.  I am spoiled since I am from Chicago where there are great pizza places everywhere.  Phoenix has a lot of places people tell me the are really good but I find most of them to be average at best.  It is hard to compare Lou Malnattis or Giordano's in Chicago to anything here.,1,1,2

Of course the server did NOT have the courtesy to tell us. We added 20% and she still didn't say a thing, resulting in an almost 40% tip!!

If you're gonna serve $15 pizzas and NOT serve bread, there is something clearly not okay (even CPK does it for crying out loud). Maybe it was the fact that there were 15 of us that our server was never around. Maybe it was because it was my birthday they decided to give attitude whenever we requested more drinks. 

Pizzas were sub-par from what I had expected, don't throw a couple slices of bell pepper and bits of zucchini and call it a vegetarian pizza. Plain cheese pizza was on the very-salty side. Drinks were not getting refilled and not once was I checked up on after food was served.

I actually took the GF & my parents there for a joint dinner.  They had never met before, and I was really banking the success of their meeting on Cibo's food and ambiance.  I can honestly say, mission accomplished!

Not that the restaurant had anything to do with the weather, but we had an amazing table outside (the only way to go here), under a tree in what turned out to be a cool Saturday afternoon. That was only the beginning.

Our appetizer plate was amazing, and definitely enough for four people to share.  This plate had enough variety, that even the pickiest of parents found something he\/she enjoyed.  

We all order pizzas, because none of us really knew how big they'd be.  The crust, cheese and toppings were everything we could have wanted. Crisp, warm and delicious.  The pizzas are big enough for two, and I'd actually recommend sharing with someone else (unless you want leftovers) because dessert is the best here.

You won't find many places that serve Nutella, let alone in homemade crepes.  The crepe with Nutella and banana was unbelievable and is a destination dessert in itself.  I'll come back just for that.  We also split one limoncello drink, which was so strong.  The parental unit was flying high after just sipping that once!

Also, some of the pizza toppings were poorly distributed. One had 2 slices with huge chunks of prosciutto but none on any of the other slices. Kind of annoying when you're splitting. The pizzas were all mediocre. I also found it irritating that they don't use those little elevated pizza holders. Our table was PACKED. It was hard to eat.

We split a bunch of desserts. I thought the tiramisu was ok but a little dense. If you hate Nutella you're pretty screwed on dessert because 80% of the dessert was heavily Nutella based. The strawberry and Nutella crepe was good, but the banana and Nutella not so much. It had way too much Nutella (which is saying a lot because I can eat Nutella by the spoonful). We also had the doughnut spheres (which were actually more like triangles... who cares but I thought it was weird that they called them spheres).

The service was excellent and they were very laid back.  

However, the pizza was disappointing.  The crust was soggy and it could have been much crispier. It definitely did not taste baked and there was no substance to it.

After trying multiple different pizzas I have come to the conclusion they are amazing and when you can't decide which of two you want from the menu, they have no problem letting you do half and half which is great. They will even let you mix the sauce pizzas with the white pizzas.

However, it isn't just pizza that is outstanding here. They have some of the best menu items I have tried anywhere, generally speaking. One of the best being the most tasty cheese plate I've ever had.

I genuinely got the feeling that the management had taken the night off, and the inmates were running the asylum because despite the fact that the place was somewhat empty by the time we got there, late in the evening, the front-of-house staff was out-to-lunch so to speak.

The place was really noisy despite being half empty. The water they brought was warm as were the three glasses they brought. We also had to push pushes to the adjoining empty table because the staff wasn't removing them.

One thing they don't put on the menu is that if you opt to order a Coca-Cola vs. say some beer, etc., the soda comes in a can (which had a weird smell to it), and at $2 for a can and a warm glass, it's a pretty extreme 10x markup.

Food-wise, the pizza to get remains the tricolore.

We tried the arancini as an appetizer, and it lacked seasoning. The server brought a small tin of marina, which wasn't enough for the 4 balls, and when we asked for more, they failed to bring more. In the end, we didn't finish the appetizer because the balls got cold.

My father got the bolognese, which I didn't try, though he said mine had more flavor. 
I'd really like to try the other pasta dish sometime, as it looks quite good.

It would seem this restaurant has seen better days, but I'm not sure. If they make some small changes in the kitchen and retrain the wait staff, it might be worth visiting again.",2,0,0

Prosciutto and fresh mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and basil, and a savory bean topping. For pizzas we ordered the Rustica and another with prosciutto and Italian sausage. Crispy crust and fresh ingredients, what more could you ask for? The arugula on the Rustica was a nice green and great aroma.  Cheese was perfectly melted as well.

Apps:
Mixed Vegetables - really good, loved the pickled carrots!
Schiacciata Maremma - DELICIOUS!  Basically a toasty focaccia bread with mozz and veggies in the middle.  Prob my favorite part of the meal.
Pizza:
Vegetariana (red pizza) - good, but really felt like they skimped on the veggies.  Next time i'll ask for extra or just order the Margherita.
Genova - white pizza w\/ mozz, pesto, potatoes, onions, and parmesan.  This was a different pizza than I've ever had before but it was very tasty and flavorful.
Dessert (this is where Cibo really won me over):
Nutella and Banana crepe - kind of hard to mess this up, but they executed perfectly: no skimping on the nutella or bananas and the crepe was the ideal texture, thin and moist but without falling apart
Fresca crepe - packed with fresh fruit, ice cream, and whipped cream: yummy!!

Cibo is a house built about a hundred years ago near downtown Phoenix that was converted to a pizzeria. The inside is fairly small with dim lights and wood floors. The outside is a little bit bigger with lots of trees lit up with Christmas lights and filled with swamp coolers. The restaurant is both intimate and casual at the same time. It almost feels like you are in another city that people actually congregate together instead of stay spread out miles apart. 

The service is pretty good for how busy they can get. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night be prepared to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to over an hour. 

The price is fair to moderate depending on how much you want to taste. I recommend tasting as much as you can preferably with at least a group of 4. 

The food is really good. Two of the appetizers that are hits are the antipasto which comes with meat, olives, mozzarella, and roasted peppers spread out on a large plate. The other is the burrata, which comes with this awesome bread slightly burnt, two home made mozzarella balls with a soft center and balsamic vinegar drizzled on top, and some prosciutto on the side. Both are really great and enough to share for 4 or more. If you can only get one definitely go with the burrata. 

The pizza is what people really come here for but maybe a bit of a disappointment depending on what you are expecting. My favorite is the margherita with spicy salami added. The pizza is about a 12"" artisanal style. The toppings are good but honestly could be better. The sauce is a tasty but on the thick side. The dough is nicely charred but too chewy. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is delicious and blows away quite a few other options in AZ but it doesn't take the cake for me. 

For dessert Cibo offers a few different crepes with nutella and fruit that are popular. Tastes like crepes filled with chocolate and fruit. Tastes decent but nothing special. 

For two people with drinks, appetizer, pizza, and dessert you are looking right under a bill with tip. 

Here's how I round it out: 
Appetizer - 5 (burrata) 
Service - 4 
Price - 3.5 
Pizza - 3.5 
Dessert - 3

I finally became tired of waiting in the line at Bianco's Pizza for hours on end, and wound up at this amazing pizza joint. It's a restored 1913 bungalow on the corner of 5th Avenue and Fillmore with outdoor seating in the cozy front yard; it even has a fireplace to relax if there happens to be a short dinner rush. 

I have been coming here with friends for a few years now; it is consistently delectable artesian pizza. I believe the chef is from Naples. It is very close to most pizza joints in that region of Italy. Some of my favorites, in this order, are: the Rustica, Tricolore, and Capricciosa pizzas. The balsamic onions are great on some pizzas too for an additional charge. 

Hands down, the best thing and reason for coming here, is the Burrata appetizer. Average meal is around $17-25, add a $30 bottle of wine and split costs with friends.

My wife owns a local establishment - where we focus on . . . yep . . customer experience. We eat at all the local joints in Phoenix and eat all the amazing food we can find. The only issue . . . we always . . always . . get the worst customer experience. 

So my wife is 40 weeks pregnant and her birthday was Monday. She wanted - homemade pasta. So we went to Cibo. Everything started off well, greeted right away, service was up to speed - it was looking good. We ordered the house salad, Diavolo pizza and a homemade pasta. 

We got the salad first - it was perfect.

Then came the pizza - it was even more perfect than the salad. That's when it happened . . . AGAIN. The waitress came back and asked us if we were ready for dessert - she FORGOT our pasta. 

Normally, I would have said something. But this literally was the 5th consecutive time we have gone out to eat at a local joint in Phoenix where they completely forgot us, or something we ordered. 

We tipped the waitress well, even though she forgot to place the right order and left. Unfortunately for Cibo - I will once again be looking for the local Phoenix restaurant that is consistent, not only with their food, but with their service. I should NEVER have to ask for my food twice .  . . hopefully they will learn.",3,0,0

Here is how I rank the pizza of Arizona, and I've tasted a LOT of it.

1. Pizzeria Bianco 
2. Patsy Grimaldi's
3. Cibo
4. Pomo
5. Humble Pie

. We ended up at Cibo because we were craving Grimaldi's (didn't have a car to get to the location in Old Town), we didn't feel like waiting for Pizzeria Bianco, and the light rail had a convenient stop around .4 miles away from Cibo. Easy walk over.  

Cibo can best be likened to Pizzeria Bianco or Pomo in taste. The owners, both very kind people, were working as the hosts the night we came in. It was around a 45 minute wait at 8:00 on a Thursday, so I just talked with my two good friends while we waited. No big deal. The restaurant had a homely feel to it, as it is a renovated old house and it was family-ran. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant had an older feel to it. More of a place for 25 year olds instead of a bunch of college students, but whatever. I'd highly recommend the outside tables for a date, it has a ""romantic"" feel to it. It is also a good place for large parties, although I think Grimaldi's is a bit more convenient. 

Now, the food.

The bread. Wow. Great bread, only beat by Chris Bianco's bread or the Andreoli's bread. I loved it, definitely worth the $2! Had a great crunch to it and was very tasty. Europeans definitely put more emphasis on their bread than Americans!

The pizza came in a pretty timely manner considering how busy it was that night. I ordered my standard, Margarita with Spicy Salami (aka, pepperoni). No normal pepperoni here. :( They had a lot of other options as well, such as Salmon for your pizza and more! The pizza was excellent. The crust was great and all around it was delightful! 

We didn't order Crepes, Salad, or Bruschetta, but I definitely want to try the Bruschetta and Crepes next time I go there. Both looked great! The restauraunt seemed to have a lot of good options for wine as well!

All around, an awesome place to be. We'll be back once school kicks up again.

P.S: Keep in mind their hours! They are closed Sundays.",3,0,2

I prefer writing positive reviews, but I have to say, what is the big buzz about this place?  What am I missing?  

The place is pretty busy for a Wednesday evening.  We had reservations for 2.  We sat at 7.  We were greeted within 5 minutes and placed drink orders.  Our waters came 5 minutes later.... our one beer and one glass of prosecco came at 7:18pm.  We decided to place our dinner entrees, so not to get caught behind huge parties.  

So thankfully, I can pull teeth to make conversation, but dang the wait was long and I did not appreciate having to be dragged longer on an already not-so-great date. (haha, that's another story).  Our food arrived after 8:00pm.  It's one thing if it's extremely busy, but the server never came to check in on us or apologize for the hold up, or see if we wanted an appetizer 'til then.... ;-\/

The Capricciosa pizze rosse and bolognese were all we ordered.  You would think after the long wait that I would devour into this and think it tastes amazing..... I guess I was disappointed.  The food wasn't as hot as I'd like it, but felt like it might have been sitting under a heat lamp for too long.  The center of the pizza's crust was soggy.  And yes, I appreciate and know the differences between napolean and sicilian style pizzas.  My pizza's toppings seemed sparse, too.  

On a good note, the bolognese pasta was delicious.  Thin wide noodles cooked al dente paired with a good serving of meaty red sauce.  Love the chunky tomatoes.  Great herb seasoning and not too salty.  Very tasty, but again, semi-warm.  

And to not completely knock the service, our server asked if we wanted their spicy oil - I asked what that was, she gave a good description, which I tried.... that was a nice dipping sauce for my cold crusted pizza.  

By this point, I didn't want to stay around longer to dry the desserts... so hopefully, next time it'll be better!?",2,1,0

Our waitress told us that those were both incorrect & if we had checked their actual website, we would see that it is actually 3pm (as if we weren't thorough in our research and must triple check). We explained to our waitress Erika that we were from LA California & if they would be able to make an exception.

Friend and I sat in the patio for dinner but then it randomly started to rain so we moved inside. I guess this place used to be a house and you can tell by the layout and the inside is just as cute as their patio. Highly recommend this as a date spot.

We ordered the pear salad, which was surprisingly good...I don't usually like arugula. Very tasty indeed! I was disappointed by the pear in the salad. If you are going to have a pear salad you should try to ensure that the pear is ripe and that it actually tastes like a pear. We also shared the vegetarian pizza which was also good. Something about the crust or the sauce or the cheese it just had a distinct flavor. It was a bit weird that the pizza was separated by the veggies i.e. one slice of red pepper, one slice of zucchini. I would have preferred for the veggies to be cut into smaller pieces and sprinkled throughout the pizza. Random? The italian beer was refreshing and lite...perfect for a hot summer night. I would definitely come back to try other things on their menu.",1,0,1

The service is horrible and our waitress didn't seem to listen at all. We ordered some bruschetta. It was ok at best. We then said we were probably interested in trying the lasagna, but to come back in a few more minutes. We told her we changed our minds on the lasagna and wanted to share a four cheese pizza. About 5 minutes later, we get lasagna. She said sorry it came out so fast and the pizza would be out in 10 minutes. We decided it wasn't such a huge deal and we could take that home. However, it is totally rude for one person to get their food and not the other person. Who does that?? We then get our pizza. 
On to the awful food. Like I said, the bruschetta was ok. Postinos is 100 times better. The lasagna, we just boxed. My boyfriend ate it the next day and said it was horrible. I make much better at home, and this was some extra special dish they had. The pizza.......oh my. It SERIOUSLY tasted like I took a bunch of cheese and melted it in the microwave. It was some of the worst pizza I have ever had. 
I will never go back. Horrible service and horrible food. I don't get why they have such good reviews. Maybe because it is in downtown and its a cool place to go hang out. Go to Angels Trumpet.",2,2,0

This place pretends like it knows what's up but it is by far the worst pizza I have had in a long time. Crust was basically burnt (a couple burnt spots are OK but the whole thing was charred) which over powered any hint of other flavor the pizza may have had which it did not. The sauce, no flavor. The mozzarella, no flavor. NONE. Flavorless white stuff. The mushrooms, little to no flavor. There was nothing going on with this pizza at all but burnt flavor with a hint of flour. I was disappointed beyond belief but also not surprised as there is not many of any good pizza places in AZ. I only had two pieces and was done.  Not authentic at all, not even close.  This place is for the typical Arizonan who has not idea how food nor pizza is suppose to taste.  People just flock for the surroundings and pretend they know what they are doing.  Grazie's in Scottsdale is as close as it gets to real Neapolitan style pizza. 

I was also not impressed with the waitress. Let's just say she did not have a way with words.  Dumber than the pizza. 
My wife needed GF crust but the waitress told us they do not bake it on trays. So why the hell bother offer GF pizza? For the fakers? WTF? 

This place was so underwhelming it was subwhelming!! I  almost fell out of my chair with boredom. My tastebuds fell asleep on the first bit, put to sleep by the boring bland blah thing they call pizza.  

It was seriously disgusting and the texture of the pizza was on the slimy side. I have had Pizza all through Italy and there are not good ones there too but the not good ones were still good, the great ones were amazing. This place is a wannabe and a complete FAILURE! Just GROSS!!!

On a good note the salad was good and the hostess was great. Other than that I won't be spending my money here again despite the ""Atmosphere"" and apparent knowledge about pizza they claim to have by the looks of their menu. Blah. Honestly the owners and chefs need to visit Italy. You can't just make up this shit and pretend to know what you are doing. Have you guys ever tasted your pizza? Flavorless, no seasoning, no nothing with their pizza.  Just a complete borefest.  I believe pizza places including Biancos have no clue how pizza should taste. Ciao!

We started off with some apps, meat-cheese platter deal--pretty good.  Entrée--I had the Salsiccia Pizze, tomato sauce, sausage, and mozzarella.  I like to critique heavily on the crust which I thought was a nice, thin, but a little chewy with slight bubbly, char for the authentic, coal-brick oven touch.  The sauce was covered lightly but still had enough tomato flavor while the cheese was nice and soft.  The sausage was cooked nicely with porky, good flavors.  

Situated near downtown, you are limited to parking on the side of the road, so no real parking lot.  The decor is artsy and charming creating a friendly, warm mood when dining inside or out.  Once inside you are greeted by a friendly staff.  There is a bar, but it's a bit small.  Depending on where you are seated, you may find it difficult to move around in terms of the air space.

I have been a huge fan of this Keg for many years, so that's what inspired me to write this review. In our party of five I ordered the Classic Filet, medium. When it arrived the first few bites were OK, but on the 3rd or 4th bite I bit into some grizzle. I thought that was odd, being that this was a filet mignon, but I decided to ignore it and kept eating. The last 1\/8 of the steak however, turned out to be one big piece of grizzle. That's when I stopped eating and mentioned it to the waiter who in turn called over the manager (he did not offer his name, I did not ask). That's where the biggest disappointment came. I explained the problem to him, and tried to show him how tough the last piece was. He seemed uninterested in examining the offending piece of meat. As if reading from a prepared script for disgruntled diners, he admitted that once in a while a little ""silver skin"" may escape the notice of the chef (this remaining piece was easily 1\/2"" thick). And then he proceeded to lecture me TWICE about how I should have let them know early on so they could have corrected the problem, completely ignoring the fact that the problem piece was at the end of the meal. It felt as if he was implying that I was trying to scam a free meal.

To their credit, they took the meal off the bill, which was the right thing to do, and no else in our party had a bad meal. But grizzle in a filet? Really? I have never encountered grizzle in filet mignon. There are plenty of other steak places in our area to try out - DC Steakhouse comes to mind - but The Keg has slipped a notch, a BIG notch, in my book. It's a real shame.",0,0,0

Went to Cibo with a large group of 14 current and past co-workers to hear our co-worker and friend play guitar there. Everything was great at first. Nice  service, nice atmosphere, as allways, good food. There was another large party on the patio with us and it was still quiet and relaxing. My co-worker brought his dog and it was cool that they allow that. Then I looked down and realized it was 7:30, and I needed to go. Some people were going to stay and drink more, but I had to go. So I asked the server if she could put $20 of our bill on my card. Um, I guess not. Get this- they DONT SPLIT CHECKS, and only take 4 debit\/credit cards per bill. So not only could I not leave until everyone paid, but we were going to have a hard time paying the bill +20% added gratuity b\/c most of us ( being 40 and under) only carry credit\/debit cards. The. best part was when I asked her to put $20 on my card she looked at me and said ""What do you want me to do with the card?"" hmm, I want to pay for my food lady. GEEZ sorry. ALL of this on a Monday night. Apparently we were $2 short ( go figure with 10 different people) and she actually brought out a calculator and tossed it at us... treated us like we were bums.The servers attitude alone was rude and ruined for us.I will go back (if I'm allowed) as the food is good and the service, usually, is good too.( At another point she said she couldn't go inside and check on something b\/c ""its too busy in there"".

 We eat here at least once a week. We enjoy their pizza and brunch. Specific items only, as this place can be over priced.

Despite the many complaints he is still in the front of the house. So sad. His communication skills are more suited for the computer world.

Felt in the mood for some Cibo pizza on my home to SoPho from a downtown Phoenix client ... was guided by the awesome female bartender towards the Diavlo pizza with added ricotta (something different from my standby Margarita pizza ... she didn't steer me wrong).  As I tend to do ... stopped by on my way home with novel in hand, ordered a dry white and a pizza to go.  The serene hum of this sweet little place was broken up by a nice older, very clean, but obviously mentally challenged man.  He walked in and loudly asked what was on the menu ... wanted a loaded pizza and a beer in this upscale downtown restaurant.  The owner gave him his utmost attention and ordered him the pizza with his toppings of choice, and a beer. I'm sorry I didn't get the owner's name, but his attentiveness and kindness endeared me even more to this place.  This diverse downtown environment may scare some away ... but I just love the energy of people helping people.  Oh, and the pizza at this place is to die for!

Luckily I came here on a night when they were serving up handmade pasta and got to try the Orecchiette Bolognese which was delicious all around, perfectly sauced, and came with a small side salad. The portion was a bit small which was a tad disappointing for the $14ish price.

We rounded up the meal with the Banana Nutella Crepe with Ice Cream...the perfectly sweet way to end the meal! Cibo has a gorgeous patio space and live music on some nights. It was a bit chilly but there were ample heaters to keep us comfortable during our meal.

Cibo initially won me over with its great atmosphere, fantastic hosts and delicious appetizers, but it did not last. Be prepared for a lengthy review because I'd really like to describe my experience in full.

I wound up at Cibo with a decent-sized group (12 total, I believe), and everything started off great; the drinks began flowing and the appetizer was being passed around for all to share. The process for ordering was a little slow, but busy Friday night, large table...no biggie. I completely understood, and we kept ourselves busy with conversation. After a bit we got our entrée orders in and everyone went with pizzas, and not 10 minutes later, they began to arrive.

Now, being the first visit for me, I decided to ask for recommendations. That's just what I like to do because I like to hear a server get really excited about one of their favorite dishes. For the white pizzas, our server suggested the Di Notte. I was instantly sold, so much so that I asked for a suggestion on the red pizzas. He then mentioned the Capricciosa, and after a brief chat between him, my girlfriend and myself (Important Note: about the artichokes on the pizza), I told him that we'd take it.

Going back to the arrival of the pizzas...they came out staggered, which made sense since there is only one pizza oven. We all began sharing as each pie came out, and life was good. First we got our Di Notte (a delicious mix of cheese and spicy salami) which was cooked perfectly and tasted great! A little later, after other pie orders began filling the table, came a vegetarian. The runners are slammed, and they just call out the names of the pizzas and wait for a hand to be raised. Not really hearing the name correctly, I asked if that was the pizza with the artichokes. The runner said yes, and I took the pizza (Note: I was the only one at the table that had artichokes on my pizza). This all brings me to the most awkward moment at a restaurant for me in a very long time. 

We decided to wait on touching the vegetarian pizza because we thought the runner just delivered to the wrong table. It happens, and I was totally ready to hand that pie over unscathed. But when our server came back and I mentioned the potential mistake, he told me that was what I ordered and continued to repeat it over and over. This was an embarrassing situation mostly because I took HIS recommendation because it was my first visit, and we had never even mentioned the ""Vegetariana,"" and because during the conversation we were having the whole table fell silent (funny little extra - the musician just started his break as well...complete silence). He caused a scene even after I had told him it was alright and we'd just take the pizza because it was a mistake. I tried not to place any blame and talked to him with a ""this happens"" kind of demeanor, but he insisted that that's what we ordered...PLUS he said that he specifically remembered us ordering that because we weren't interested in artichokes. Guess what's on the Vegetariana, folks? Yep. Artichokes. A whole fourth of the pizza was covered in them (I love artichokes, by the way. This posed no problem.). Once that was pointed out, instead of any sort of apology, he decided to explain how the artichokes were only on one ""quadrant"" of the pizza. C'mon now...I can see a bullshitter, and that was just blatant. It's ridiculous to claim that we ordered a different pizza because of one particular ingredient only to order another with the SAME ingredient. I hope you, the reader, is understanding the uncomfortable situation that I was in because it was a weird one. I kind of couldn't wait to get out of there for the remainder of the dinner.

That all being said, the woman at the cash bar, Melissa, was great, and she really made an effort to make our table feel a little more comfortable after the whole incident. I hope the owner of Cibo can take note of that because it wasn't really her job, but she was sweet, personable and took it upon herself to feel embarrassed and responsible for our server.

My first trip to Cibo was a bust, and it's really hard to want to make a return visit, but in time I'm sure I will. I can't let one bad experience dictate how I completely feel about such a beloved local restaurant. Sorry for the length, but I hope this review can be of help to someone. The food and the atmosphere was good, but my experience with the service totally overshadowed them.",15,5,7

The pizzas are unique, but well-balanced. The toppings are well thought out...they're not throwing a bunch of strange stuff on a pizza just because they can; the flavors really meld well. The crust is chewy but not difficult to eat. My pizza was a tad overdone on the bottom, but it was easily overlooked.

(If traveling by public transportation), don't be discouraged by the slightly awkward walk from the light rail station (Van Buren) to the restaurant (5th and Fillmore).  Cibo sits right on the corner and is built into an old house.  Visually pleasing -- lowlight, original artwork -- I liked the ambience.  It was refreshing to get away from the contemporary desolation that is downtown Phoenix.  Granted, my friend and I dined on July 4th (a quiet night for many restaurants), but the service was wonderful.  Our server struck up conversation and seemed genuine in recommending her favorite antipasti, pizza and wine\/beer combinations.  The antipasto speciale was full of interesting flavors and the Prosciutto Crudo pizza was simple yet tasty.  Great dough and black label meat is always a plus.  I stand for beer with pizza so the server pointed me to a micro brew that's right out of Tuscon (forget the name, but second of the four).  Since it was a mellow night, we were allowed to lounge outside on the patio with the Nutella and strawberries.  I probably could have gone without dessert (considering I had a few slices to take home), but my sweet tooth said otherwise.  Overall a really pleasant and peaceful experience.  I also appreciated the server's comment that contrary to popular belief, Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco are not rivals.  Rather, they endorse each other in front of guests.",4,1,5

As far as Pizza goes, which is what we went for, I was not that impressed.  I must say I'm more of a NY style, by the slice pizza kind of guy.  So the pizza did not hit the spot.  Maybe a little too fancy for my palette. (You can take a boy out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of the boy, so for me simple food is always better.)  Obviously, there are enough people who like gourmet pizza as this place has amazing reviews, so I'm just one simple man.

The obnoxious fat chick sitting right behind me proclaimed to her friend, ""I'm no longer investing time in men who aren't available!""  Put down the pizza and grab a dry salad and shut up!!  That's not really the restaurants fault though but I did have to endure that convo through the duration of my meal.

Our server was very nice however seemed very rushed and at times we had to wait for refills on water and for the check.  The atmosphere is very romantic outside with light trees and live music.  They even turned on one of the heaters on the patio for the lil lady.  We has the Crepe with Nutella chocolate powdered sugar and ice cream and it was very very good.

The parking at Cibo is atrocious. Aside from the cutthroat street-side parking, there are something like six parking places in the back. 

That being said, the food here is amazing. Cibo has two distinct menus: a lunchtime and dinnertime selection. Sandwiches are during lunch and Pizzas are dinner. Pizzas are not served here during lunchtime since the wood oven requires different temperatures for sandwiches. If you NEED a pizza, arrive in the evening. 

This is not to say that the sandwiches are worth skipping. They are delicious. The bread is a perfect blend of crisp and soft. A lunchtime visit is definitely recommended. 

However, the star of the show here is the pizza; their pizzas are amazing. There is JUST enough char from the wood ovens to give the dough that brittle crispness that is a sign of a great thin-crust pizza. Their ingredients are fresh and each bite gives a discernible taste for each ingredient in the pizza. It is not a mish-mash of grease and spice like so many other pizzas are. 

For dessert, you must get their crepes. Their crepes make a perfect end to a wonderful meal.

The service here is extremely friendly and accommodating. 

To give an idea of how good this place is, here is an anecdote. We went to Cibo in the middle of summer late in the afternoon. It was about 113 degrees Fahrenheit outside. When we arrived we found out that their air-conditioning was out.

The reasons I'm giving it such a poor review is everything I experienced this evening - outside of the food - was awful. They don't accept reservations which I think is a quack. Usually when a restaurant doesn't accept reservations, they have a bar area or a patio where you can sit, relax, and wait to be seated. Cibo has a bar - a tiny one - inside the home. There is almost no place to sit and wait to be seated for dinner. We arrived at about 7:30 and were told there would be an hour wait...I think it was closer to 75-80 minutes. As I was the oldest in my group with some health issues, I was the one chosen to get to sit in the one and only (metal) chair by the front entrance. I was thankful for that.

There was no wait staff who came by to see if we wanted anything to drink, so my friends and I waited the entire time, badly in need of refreshment.

We finally were seated on the patio about ten feet from a fellow with an electric keyboard. Call me old and cranky, but when I come to dine in a restaurant, I want to be able to talk in a low voice with my dining companions. Granted, we didn't have to yell to be heard with the music right next to us, but it was definitely hard to hear each other. 

We did receive our menus after about five minutes, but I think it was another 30 minutes before we got our meals. The waitresses did keep our water glasses filled which was nice.

Our table was metal, sitting on a paver-type floor, and was uneven. My friend had to keep her foot on the bar of the table to keep it from wobbling. The table had cross bars on either side so you couldn't even sit dead-on to the table. I had to sit sideways and was very uncomfortable. The chairs were horrendous...plastic, skinny, and barely enough room to seat your behind. I think those chairs are there to encourage you to eat and run.

I loved our food...we had the Burrata, the Tricolore and the Tartufta (sp?) pizze which was extraordinary. We didn't get dessert as we were stuffed.

Unfortunately at 10pm on a Friday night, there was a wait to sit outside so we settled for sitting inside. Sit outside if you can, it's like a scene from a movie out there. 

Cibo pizzas are Pauline P. sized pizzas. I'm a girl with a pretty sizable appetite and these pizzas left me feeling full and satisfied. Ordered the magherita and added italian sausage to it. Everything was great, even the crust and I'm generally not a crust girl. Basil was fresh and the sausage tasted excellent. Our server was well-versed in the menu and knew exactly what she was talking about. She recommended to get half of the Di Notte and half of the Tartufata since my friend was wanting a pizza bianche but was unsure of what to get. She also hooked it up with this spicy oil to dip our pizza crusts in - yum!",2,1,2

This seems to be the trend in 2010+, find an old house or business and convert into a comfortable, home-style, eating experience.  The house concept was relaxing, in a old neighborhood of brick homes and full-grown shade trees and at the same time, seeing the downtown Phoenix landscape on the near horizon.

The Drinks: n\/a
Didn't feel like any drinks on this visit although the menu selection looked decent.

The Food: ****
We started with the Pear Salad, organic spinach, pear, pecorino cheese, honey and toasted almonds.  Very refreshing, and probably could have stopped here.

The bread basket was a little weak.  Didn't feel bad not getting seconds,   where normally I would.

I had the Calzone.  Much bigger than I expected.  Good pizza dough\/crust, smooth and not too spicy sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, prosciutto and salami.  I don't recall any other ingredients in the calzone like onions, bell peppers or mushrooms.  More of a creamy texture like folding up a slice of pizza and eating it.  Very good.

Kat had the bolognaise.  Again, good flavor in the meat sauce, homemade noodles and healthy portion.

The Dessert: *****
Mostly crepe menu items like Nutella and berries or moscapone and lemon zest with powered sugar.  Nice end to a good meal.

The Service: **
Our waitress was nice but the rest of the staff seemed a little ""tired"" and unexcited.  We intentionally left our water bottle on the edge of the table to see if they would offer to refill.  No such luck.  Super bowl week is just starting so they better step up their game.",1,1,1

The outside seating totally deserves 5 stars, but thats about the only 5 star I can give, if it weren't for the wonderful atmosphere I would've only given 2 stars.  

After being seated we had to wait a while for our server to come over to the table.  Not sure if he was new or just having an off night but I was not impressed with him.  I was actually jealous of the tables around us and their interactions with wonderful servers.  We explained to the server it was our first time eating there and he just started pointing to stuff and spouting off about all sorts of different pizzas, meats, cheeses, wines, etc...It was a little overwhelming and he lost me.  When we were  ready to order we had to first flag him down and interrupt his conversation with another employee.  He took our order and quickly walked away without even asking if we wanted  anything to drink.  We originally planned on getting a bottle of wine but after my boyfriend had to walk inside the building the get some service and a drink we decided against the bottle.  Very disappointing!   I'm also somewhat glad we didn't order the bottle of wine because while we were still sitting there enjoying our dinner and conversation they started clearing off our entire section and staring at us as if we were keeping the restaurant open.  Keep in mind the place was still open for 30 more minutes.  I honestly felt rushed and that I couldn't enjoy myself.  If we didn't have to wait so long, flag down our server or go in the restaurant ourselves to order a drink we may have actually finished our meal a lot sooner.  

We opted for the sausage pizza, which was good but not the best.  The mozzarella cheese was delicious and tasted very fresh, as was the crust.  But other than that I really wasn't all that impressed.

Cibo was lucky enough to set the stage for Andrea K's birthday on Saturday night and I was lucky enough to attend for the first time. The restaurant is a converted house in central phoenix that looks very cozy and warm. I say 'looks' because I had to eat outside in the freezing cold dressed inappropriately. Come on Phoenix, I didn't move here for culture, I moved here for a promise of HEAT! 

Um, anyway, our group was too large to fit in any of the rooms inside, so we were seated in the front yard with space heaters sporadically placed around us. Our server was very friendly, and though he seemed to be serving the ENTIRE clientele of the restaurant, made his way over to us frequently.  The ladies who delivered the meals weren't terribly effusive, whispering what the order was and trying to set it down in front of whoever was closest, instead of the right person, so I ended up shouting out everything and directing the traffic.  But at the end of the night Cibo was VERY cool about the various methods of payments we utilized for the bill and with such a large group that is generous.

I ordered the Smoked Salmon pizza with arugula and capers added. It was great, I ate almost the entire pizza myself. I did manage to take some home, and what I noticed the next day was that it was uber salty. I love salty food but this was way more than I remembered from the night before and off-putting.  I liked Cibo and I would go back there (in warmer weather) because I think the 'designer' pizzas are fairly reasonable in price and the ambiance is nice.",3,2,5

We ordered the following:
- burrata 
- Salsiccia pizza

Burrata was great! The mozzarella cheese was so delicious and paired perfectly with the prosciutto. However, as a personal preference, I probably would've preferred the waitress had told us that 1 order of burrata is enough for a meal.. for 2 people. 

When the two pizzas were served, my colleague and I were too full.  We managed to each eat one slice of the pizzas.. then I just picked out the toppings for the procida pizza.  Well, I guess that says how good that combination is.

After hearing SO much about it and working downtown for 10 years, it sure has taken me a long time to get there!  Even the deserted patio (at 5:30 on a Thursday in August) made me happy.  Walking inside, instantly greeted by a friendly host, followed by an equally friendly server.  Service was stellar, attentive, kind, informed, relaxed but not lazy, and suggesting menu items which I always appreciate.

We decided on the special pizza of the night.  Pizza Marechiaro : Fresh Bufala Mozzarella, San Marzano Dop, Chopped basil and Sea salt!  Like a ""super-margherita"" the server said.  How could we NOT get it?  We also go the Pesto Salad which came with roasted potatoes, a light pesto dressing, and delicious bread to go with.

The salad was delicious as was the pizza!  The ingredients were super fresh, the crust was the perfect amount of chewy, the prices were reasonable, and YES there was not a two hour wait to go with the food (even though, I still love the other place too!).  The only part that I didn't love was that the super fresh tomato-ey sauce made the crust a little droopy when I picked it up.  My favorite is a crispy crust that doesn't fall when you take a bite, but hey, small price to pay for perfection every where else.

Even the tiny little flowers in the tiny little bud vase on the table made my day!  I can't wait to go back again . . . and again . . . and again.  Lucky me I work about a mile away!  You (may or may not) know me, I hardly give five stars on just one visit, but trust me, this has five stars written all over it!!",3,1,2

This place sets the Neapolitan pizza standard in Phoenix (amidst quite a bit of competition).  Bianco, yeah yeah, it's good, if you've got the patience to wait and know well in advance that all the hype is more than just a wee overstated.  I've eaten at Cibo probably 50 times in the last 5 years and, without question, it is safe to say that it's better than Bianco.  Guido has established a standard of excellence and consistency with the pizzas that is beyond compare, really at any restaurant I've ever frequented.  And then you have ever-changing pastas and (in the winter) soups Tuesdays and Wednesdays?  Out of this world sandwiches, served only at lunch?  And have you HAD their breakfast?  It's all ridiculously excellent.  And stupid reasonably priced.

We started with an Antipasto Speciale - a mixed dish with prosciutto crudo,bresaola with arugula and parmigiano, roasted red peppers with black
olives and capers, Cipolle di Rosa, fresh mozzarella and grape tomatoes served with a fantasy of olives.  This was one of the best antipasto dishes, we fought over who got the last bite.

Next we ordered a pizza, my husband had done his homework and read the reviews, so we decided to try the Di Notte - fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola, mozzarella and spicy salame, thin crust, good texture, flavors were different, we ate it all.

And finally for desert we had to try the neutela crepes, we got two, a warm crepe filled with nutella and sprinkled with powdered sugar and chocolate sauce and the Nutella and Banana - a warm crepe filled with nutella and sliced banana, topped with powdered sugar and chocolate sauce.

She was impatient with us, when my friend asked for a clean plate, she investigated the plate before deeming it worthy of being replaced. I kept asking for more water, 4 times and on the 3rd time she just ignored me, physically looked around me, while getting my friends drinks. Finally, the same friend ordered water for us because she was pretending not to hear me. The food was mediocre at best, which was really disappointing. Then we ordered dessert and got a crepe with nutella and strawberries. While it was delicious, there were maybe 3 strawberries in the entire thing, which was a drag since the bites with strawberries were so good. When it came to the check, she split it by ""couple"" took our payments and then completely forgot about one of the couples and just brought it back with the card, not run.

The tables are terribly close together- but cozy. We had brought two kids with us- not really kid menu friendly. No highchairs, boosters or anything of that nature. I wished I had known that prior to going- perhaps a note on the website regarding their inability to accommodate small children. 
The waitress was not friendly at all- she seemed annoyed that there were kids with us and rolled her eyes at us a few times. 
The pizza was good- but enjoyed the antipasto plate more than the pizza. The patio was nice, but it was closed because it was ""only 64 degrees""-- shorts weather for us.

But since it was my birthday, my friend took me here for dinner...and when someone offers to take you out for your birthday, who says, ""hell no, I'm not eating that!""  So I went.

Let me start with the ambiance of the place. The restaurant is actually a house, it looked very homey. We opted to sit outside in front because it was late evening and we saw they had misters...plus, the decorations outside looked so romantic and sweet. Definitely a good choice for a first date! Or ...the 100th date. 

Now on to the food.  He ordered for us but I got to choose the dessert, and yes, I asked for it to come out FIRST.  It was a crepe filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit.  At first I said, ""damn, $12 for a crepe?"" Man, that was amazing.  And well worth more than $12.

We got two pizzas, they were about 8 inches around and it can probably feed a party of 2 (but since we had a huge crepe before, we had to take some pizza togo). My pizza had prosciutto topped with fresh, organic arugula. The crust was thin and very tasteful. I couldn't get enough of it. His pizza had salami, mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese. Also quite delectable.  Our waiter was very nice, he knew we were talkers so he left us alone to do so. After we were done eating, we wanted to get some coffee but it was 10:30pm on a Sunday night and no one was opened.  Again, our waiter came to the rescue and told us about a local coffee house down the street, about 5 minutes away.  We went there and it was amazing too!....but that's a different review.  :)

Now, the reason I won't give Cibo 4 or 5 stars has to do with service. 
(a) The ""small"" antipasto is for 2 people. When you order the ""large"" antipasto for 4 people everything comes divisible by 3. 3 pieces of bresaola, 3 pieces of prosciutto, etc. This does not make mathematical sense.
(b) You have to pace the servers. That means absolutely do not order your pizza until you are finished with appetizers. They just don't understand the issue with bringing out a pizza 60 seconds after giving you the anitpasto.
(c) The person clearing off the table after antipasto will ask you to hold on to your silverware instead of bringing you a fresh fork and knife. I hate this and never understand why restaurants do it. What rubs salt into the wound is that if you order one dessert to split between 4 people they will then bring you 4 fresh sets of silverware.
(d) On two occasions we split a bottle of prosecco to start. on both occasions the flutes had hard water stains and these are accentuated by the collection of bubbles from the liquid trying to breakdown the hard water calcium deposits. Just like removing acid from around a car battery but not what I need as a first impression at a restaurant.",1,0,0

FOOD:
Cibo has elevated my expectations of good pizza. The crust was crisp and the flavor combinations were expert! I had a half and half combination of Diavola and Genova. The Diavola is slightly spicy and though I don't like spice, the flavor was excellent! I highly recommend the Genova pizza! An entirely unique flavor experience! 

SERVICE:
We had a fantastic service team, Yasmin and Brittany were kind and welcoming and had such a genuine approachability. They wanted us to have a great experience and gave us passionate recommendations! They are great!

FOOD: 4 stars.
The food here was really good - better than I was expecting. The only thing I didn't like was the Bruschetta three ways. One piece comes with the traditional tomatoes, basil, and olive oil (really good), one piece had prosciutto (?) and cheese on it (second best, not great) and the third piece had something with olives on it. I didn't even try it because I absolutely hate olives. It would be a lot better if they stuck to the traditional tomato, basil, olive oil one. The Caprese Salad was also really good and it came as a pretty large portion. we ordered the pizza due to the recommendation by our server. The pizza was really good, especially for having no pizza sauce. It was light and didn't give us a food coma feeling. The only drawback was that their lunch menu didn't offer any pasta, which was a little disappointing. Apparently they make their own pasta in house for dinner only, which I really wanted to try but didn't get to. Everything we ordered was really good and I would order it again! 

SERVICE: 4 stars.
Service was really good and really patient. I appreciated our sever's patience while we had a lot of questions and a lot of requests. Everything came out quickly and was really good!

LOCATION: 4 stars.
Cute restaurant but I was so confused walking up to it. I thought it was someone's house, honestly. It was hard to find the actual front door for the main restaurant, because there is a smaller side of the place adjacent to it.

We decided to order the Sunday dinner special - lasagna, and the Diavola pizza - red sauce, mozz, spicy salami and definitely add the ricotta cheese for an extra $2. 

I didn't care for the lasagna much since the insides had a lot of veggies (carrots and celery). Yes it is different but I live my meats! 

I did enjoy the pizza very much. I added more chili flakes for an added spice. The spicy salami had a good kick and the added cheese made the pizza really creamy. Delicious. Unfortunately, the crust was soggy with all our toppings. I would have preferred a crunchier crust.

The bread delivered with the salad was a white chewy bread.  My friend wanted meat on his pizza, and I didn't. They allowed us to get half and half; I got my veggie pizza on one side, and his sausage was on the other. Perfect!   The dessert we ordered was kind of like a delicious deconstructed funnel cake with Nutella for dipping sauce - delicious!  

Service: The servers were efficient and brought us water throughout and were helpful and quick.  I wouldn't say the employees were overly friendly, though. While walking in, a female employee opened the door but just kind of stood there, not saying anything. No, ""welcome"" or ""hello"" - nothing.  Strange to me, but that's my Texan roots craving some more friendliness! 

For reservations, one must have a group of six or more to make reservations.  We just had two but easily found a table on a Saturday evening at 5:30pm.",0,0,0

The wait staff has always been gracious as well (which is necessary when dining with a 3 and 1 year old!) Love this place!

Update 7\/28\/17: continues to be one of the TOP restaurants in the valley. Celebrated my husband's birthday there last night and Megan provided exceptional service for our special date night. The food, as always, was an amazing experience. The fresh pasta with black truffle special was on point. Also the dolce vita white pizza will now be my new go-to entree. Exceptional.

Worth the dampness from head to toe.  The BONUS is sitting under the African tree with the lights and grapes with the FULL moon shining on us  ~

Our red haired waiter sporting 1950's style glasses was fun, fun, fun and pleasingly attentive.   We had white wine;  superb choice thanks to the 4 different wine tastes I received while choosing it.  

The strawberry\/walnut salad was a bit dry, yet the feta was marvelous!  Great soft texture to melt in your mouth.  

The pizza was the sausage and it was wood fired, nice and perfect.  Just enough food for the 3 of us ~

So much food, just the right amount for our bellies.  For the 3 of us, the bill was only $43.00.  Not too bad on a Saturday night to go in 1\/3's.

Focaccia appetizer was just okay. Bland even with the side of balsamic vinegar. 

Pizza...  Excellent crust!  But again, bland. Mine had potatoes which I like on pizza but usually they are applied in thin slices. These were big chunks which made for a pasty, starchy texture. 

Nutella crepe dessert was slimy. I felt the problem was an undercooked crepe. Maybe the kitchen is also too dark.

I took my two small children (2 and 4) and while there wasn't anything about the restaurant that was overtly bad for kids, a lot of people go to have a nice talk over dinner and relax, and, well, my kids (like most their age) are beyond boisterous so I probably won't take them again just to spare the other guests. 

The two things that made me a little uncomfortable were the mosquitoes outside and the lack of lighting outside. I went when the sun was setting and it was a bit hard to read the menu, but I asked our server to turn some lights on and when she did all was well :)

Cibo is, on the most part, a pizza place. The parking lot is full of very nice BMWs and Audis. So it must have done something right.

The pizzas at Cibo remind me a lot of those at La Grande Orange: gourmet toppings, thin sourdough crust, and fragrant cheese. We ordered three pizzas for the table, all tasted great, except that... they were awfully similar. 

Granted, I probably shouldn't expect too much of a variety when we were having pizzas (for a birthday celebration), but I was hoping for something life-changing, like the slice of pizza I had in Rome.

Now upon our journey to Italy we ended up in Naples (birthplace of Pizza), and couldn't believe how identical the pizza there (Naples) was to Cibo, delicious may I add!

and a drizzle of white truffle oil after the pizza is cooked. I do appreciate the uniqueness of the pizza. HOWEVER, I do think that the crust was too dry. There is thin crust pizza and there is doughy pizza -- but this pizza seemed a little burnt? I did only try one pizza, so perhaps there are more tasty pizzas than this one. 

I was a fan of the Nutella and Strawberries Crepe! Added a spoonful of vanilla ice cream on top! Yum!

Overall, I love the feel of this place when eating here at night. They've got pretty lights that sets the mood! Great alternative to Pizzeria Bianco's long wait lines!",1,1,3

My friends were raving about this place while we sat at Gino's East in Chicago dining on what I like to think as some of the finest pizza around.  So for someone to suggest there was good pizza, in Arizona, I had to see it to believe it.  

The inside is literally the front of a house with a bar area immediately to your right, a table for a large group set front and center, with the kitchen behind it, and bathrooms that in any other setting someone would have viewed the cracked toilet seat and floor tiles as grotesque, but here, the added bouquet of flowers and wall mirror made for a rustic, inside-someone's-personal-house, geriatric feel.  

We sat outside, as the temperature had cooled down to a manageable, sunless 90 degrees and my friend's fiance was meeting up with us with her puppy (yes it's dog friendly). The outside patio was separated into two areas with the main walkway down the middle.  The floor was made up of mismatched bricks, some jutting up, with small two to four seat, wrought iron tables strategically placed around the center where a tree was unruly growing out of the brick and mud.  They had decorated it with a string of white lights which gave the atmosphere of the perfect place for a date. 

Everything at Cibo is cooked in their fire-grill oven, and they mostly have wine with a few specialty beers brought to you by a rather odd waiter.  We first ordered an appetizer of Schiacciata Maremma, half without eggplant and our little sandwiches came with just enough time to gobble them up before my friend's fiance arrived and even knew we ordered.  The crunch of the bread from the wood-fired oven with the melted cheese holding the vegetables in was the perfect start to a fantastic meal.  We then ordered pizzas, the Pizza Rosse Vegetariana and I believe my friend had the Di Notte pizza, adding potatoes.  The crust was thin and had just the right amount of crisp, but still strong enough to hold the massive amount of toppings.  I wouldn't compare it to Gino's East, but overall, it was a pretty good, healthy pizza.  It felt almost homemade.  

We finished the meal off with a nutella and strawberry crepe which was to DIE for.  There are few restaurant chef's that seem to make a crepe the correct way, thin, less like a pancake, and still strong enough to hold together your ingredients. They managed to get the crepe and ingredients just right and we walked away extremely full and satisfied.  Not before her 3 month old puppy went to sit on the neighboring tables lap after they picked her up.  An extremely chill, relaxing atmosphere.  I highly recommend finding this Phoenix gem while you are in town.",2,0,1

THIS IS SO NOT THE CASE. Cibo was a start for our fabulous evening downtown on my farewelll Phoenix tour (LOL!). We had dinner here before the Madonna concert and it was Fanfreakintastic! 

The place was humming with regulars and plenty of Madonna fans. Weather was perfect for al fresco dining. We sat comfortably at a table in back with impeccable service by a new server named Kim. She rocked our meats and cheeses. 

Literally. We ordered the appetizer of meat, cheeses, nuts and fruit. For $19 it was really a steal and fed us four Madonna fans well. The homemade mozzeralla was TDF...the proscuitto, bread, olives, goat cheese, grilled veggies...MOUTHGASM!

Of course we had to have a pizza and the Margherita pizza sang to us!!! Crust was perfection, pillowy and crunchy with the soft cheese, tangy sauce and fresh basil. 

We were indeed doing the happy food dance. Which was a great excercise as we danced our tails off several hours later. So the food was much needed fuel. 

Ambience was as charming as everyone has mentioned.

Bianco is about a 3 hour wait, and while I'm not saying that it would have been wonderful, I was able to come to Cibo at around 5:30 and get in with my party of 4 no problem.  Walking in, your greeted by your host, right behind her, a bar, and then a glimpse of their coal burning pizza oven.  When I saw the pizza burning right next to the coal, I knew I was in the right place.  After a couple of cold Peroni's we ordered the buffalo mottzerlla with prosciutto and baguette.  It was wonderful.  The cheese is sourced from Italy, and I have to say it was the best I have ever had.  Stringy, soft, lightly salty goodness.  For our main courses, we shared the spicy pepperoni pie, while my in laws opted for a Greek pizza with artichoke hearts, feta, ham, and olives.  Both were good, but the pepperoni was a must have.  The crusts were really something special, with a nice crisp and a slight burn from the oven.  For dessert, we had some creaps.  Don't leave here with out having the nutella and bananna one, it was to die for and went really well with my last few sips of wine.

That being said I did enjoy some of the aspects of my dinner at Cibo.  The atmosphere and the service were fantastic.  The antipasto appetizer was great and puts the antipasto at Caffe Boa to shame.  (Although I did find the mozzarella in the antipasto to be rather flavorless which is bad because its my favorite type of cheese) The nutella crepe with bananas was heavenly, but then again anything with nutella is.

However, there are some pretty major drawbacks here for me.  The wine I had was pretty awful, which could have been my own fault.  I swear it was Franzia, or else came out of a box. Then there is the pizza.  We ordered the vegetarian pizza minus the mushrooms and were slightly shocked to discover when it came out that the toppings were spread individually on the slices.  So you have two slices with a single slice of roast zucchini, two slices with a single piece of artichoke, and two slices with a meager portion of red peppers.  For $11 for a 12"" pizza, it should be covered with toppings. I have never in my life seen a pizza constructed in such a fashion.  I like my toppings to be mixed together so you get all the flavors coming together at once on every slice.  With the size of the antipasto I was surprised to see that there were so little toppings on the pizza itself. We also ordered a calzone which was constructed in a similar fashion- a lot of meat on one side and cheese on the other.  And I have to say that there was a lot more dough than I would have liked there to be with the calzone.  

I would be willing to go back to try some of their lunch sandwiches but as far as pizza goes its not going to work out between us.

Update:  I suggested Cibo to a friend over the weekend....only to find out they don't serve lunch on Saturday?  What?  If its so ""urban"" they should be serving lunch on the weekends!!!

Update:  I recently went to Cibo for lunch with Melissa H.  I have to say that I was completely underwhelmed by my sandwich.  The prosciutto was flavorless.  The mozzarella was almost non existent.  The tomato slice was huge.  I basically had a pressed tomato sandwich.  I didn't think it was possible for a sandwich to lack flavor that way but apparently it is.  

People need to start eating better sandwiches if you think these are great.  They are mediocre at best.  

Meh.  I'm so not impressed with this place. I'm sitting betwee a 2 and 3 right now but I'll give them the 3 since the service is always friendly and they have Miss Vicky's chips.",6,2,4

I was charged extra (despite removing 3 kinds of cheese from the original order), and with the automatic gratuity (parties of 6+) I ended up spending $30 for a cheese-less pizza, a side house salad, and only drank water.
The service was pretty bad.  Maybe because our waitress knew she was getting auto gratuity she just didn't give a crap but she always seemed annoyed whenever near us, and one of our orders came out 15 min after the rest of the table (but they comped it).

Dear Ted, thanks for giving us a couple of tries, everyone has their opinion about what they like in a pizza, in Italy they use a knife and fork, we make our crust more soft and chewy more Italian style, and that does not appeal to everyone, however to imply that our other reviewers are just coming to us because the wait is shorter, or that we take less pride in our product then others is somewhat mean spirited, I m sure you didn t intend to insult our dedicated chef or our restaurant but unfortunately it could be misinterpeted by other Yelpers, you are intitled to your opinion and so are our fans on Yelp, thanks again for your imput, Karen Martingilio

I took my man here for ""mystery date night"" as a surprise since he had never been.  No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!  

I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.  You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date - hell, maybe even a mystery one :)",0,0,0

Went with a friend and sat at the bar (my preferred location in most restaurants).  Did get good wine bottle recommendation.  Bartender recommended we each get a pizza as one was too small.  My friend is a social butterfly and makes friends with everyone else at the bar (fortunately) and we kinda decide we'll share each other's pizzas.  We each order a pizza.  Here's where things start going badly.
1. The pizzas are large enough to share between 2.
2. My friend's pizza (white pizza with some stuff and truffle oil).  WAY too much truffle oil as we can't taste anything else.
3. My pizza doesn't arrive.  A few minutes later I ask the bartender where my pizza is.  ""Should be out any minute""
4. 10 minutes later - ""Should be out any minute""
5. 15 minutes later - ""Uh, we are making it now"" - Note that all of these were at my request for an update, not proactive by the bartender.

Since we shared pizza amongst the bar, I don't want it anymore.  I tell the bartender to stop the order.  ""uh, ok, we won't charge you for it"".  No kidding!!

Believe me this place is worth the wait. By far my favorite pizza place thus far. I am eagerly anticipating my next travel there. Not soon enough...",2,1,3

Being compared to a place that was I believe voted the best Pizza in the USA by USA today (I think) should right away tell you something about this place.  I am not going to compare the two as both are fantastic places with excellent food.  If I had a last meal and one of these two were served I would not die unsatisfied!

So after about a year of trying to find the right time to go there my wife, 9 year old daughter and myself along with a few friends, we made it to Cibo last eve for dinner.  We goti there at 5:45 pm on a Saturday night, thankfully had reservations and sat right down.  First impressions, am I back east at a great eatery.  The ambiance being downtown outside was just fantastic, something I have not experienced here in Phoenix since moving here in the mid 90's.  Very old world, loved it!

We started with two appetizers, the meat plate with cheese, some grilled veggies and some fruit and the eve's special the fried rice and cheese balls with marinara sauce.  Both were spot on, delicious and loved by all at the table.

Onto the pizza's, what more can you say than spectacular.  My daughter and her friend had the margarita pizza with no basil, my wife the spicy salami red pizza, they all raved and devoured theirs quickly.  Myself I wanted to try two pizzas and was amazed that at a place with individual pizza's like this you can get 1\/2 and 1\/2.  What a treat and beyond what I expected at a artisan pizza place like this.  So I LOVE white pizza and went  with one half of the potato and sausage pie and 1\/2 of the 4 cheese and spicy salami pie.  WOW is all I can say.  Now the sausage and potato half was very good, but it did not even compare to the 4 cheese and spicy salami.  The cheese on that side had great flavor, salt and spice, I sadly shared one (yes only 1) slice of the pie with the rest of the table and the reaction was the same.  Why didn't I order that?  If you like cheese, salt and spice, this is the pie for you!

All that food and yep we still had to try dessert.  My daughter LOVES nutella and they have about 4 or 5 crepes with nutella in them.  She and her friend went with the nutella, strawberry, banana and chocolate crepe with vanilla ice cream on top.  DELISH.  Glad they were kind of full after 1\/2 way thru it as the rest of the adults at the table gladly finished it off.  

The adults went with the Fresco dessert, crepes with fresh fruit and whipped cream on top.  It was also fantastic (but next time I would go Nutella), very light and a perfect ending to a great dinner.

Its quite a drive from my house in S.E. Chandler to this place, thankfully we had an event downtown.  Would I make this trip for dinner with the wife on a weekend eve, without a doubt worth it.  Would I make sure to go there next time I am downtown for anything.  Heck yes!  This is just the kind of place that I love.  Great food, great atmosphere.

Ok so the place and atmosphere was probably my favorite thing about the experience... I just like being in old buildings... this one was built in 1913... so I personally enjoyed just looking around. Plenty of seating inside or out... so thats all good...

The food was pretty good, I would not go back to order the Margharita pizza again, but I'll definitely go back to check out the rest of the menu... just to throw this out there... there is another very well known pizza spot down the road in which I WOULD go back just to get some more of that Margharita pizza... this one is good, but not as good as the place down the road! The Genova was freakin great... pesto, mozzarella, onion, potato... kind of like we had in italy... No regrets about the food, it was good, the salad was $14 which was good, but not 14 bucks good! The pizza is worth the trip and the money. If you read my reviews i base my rating on my desire to return... i give it 4 stars because the food was good enough that I'll definitely go back to taste the rest of that good sized menu, but not 5 because it wasn't upto par with other pizza ive had around the area!

With so many reviews, I find it hard to bring anything else to the table with mine, but Cibo is so adorable I had to write a review anyway. I visited Cibo for dinner and fell like I was swept away to an adorable village in Naples. It was dark when we arrived and upon seeing the outdoor lights sparking on the courtyard patio, I immediately felt welcomed with open arms. When walking inside, the house was singing with visitors and staff alike. It felt like a home rather than a restaurant and what a good feeling that was. Although still a bit on the warm side, we sat outside underneath a grandfather tree and between the patio decor, glistening lights and secret garden-like atmosphere, it was already a positive experience without even tasting the food. The other visitors eating outside were regulars and immediately greeted us and began offering their suggestions when they realized they were talking to first timers. During the course of the dinner we started with Bresola and wine and contemplated about the pizza. But the regulars insisted that all first timers needed to try the Genova so we went with it and they were more than right. The Genova has mozzarella, homemade basil pesto, roasted potatoes white onions and grated Parmesan. All I can say is Grazia to the regulars because they know how to point newbies in the right direction! 

Prior to visiting, I was told that Cibo beats most other pizza restaurants in Phoenix and all it took was one taste to agree. I'm adding this to resident and visitor must lists alike because I'm deeming Cibo a staple Phoenix restaurant for anyone who enters our desert oasis!",15,1,9

First off the place is pretty small inside. We were a table of 4 put in the corner of this really small room with a ceiling fan. But there were so many people in this little room that it was warm so it made it uncomfortable. 
Our waitress was polite. A little timid which sometimes made her unhelpful but all in all she was ok. 
We got a appetizer which was this fried rice ball with cheese. Nothing special. Pretty bland.
And we got two different pizzas the margarita and the pesto potato one. 
The margarita pizza was awful!!!! It had so much sauce that was the wrong consistency on it that it made the pizza a instant droopy mess and totally soggy. It was gross. The pesto potato pizza was actually very good and it is what we ended up eating. The rest of everything else we just left there and was a total waste.

Is it my favorite pizza? No. But not having my favorite pizza doesn't disqualify them from a 5 star rating from me.

I love the quaint atmosphere, and the fact that the owners are there working, and interacting with the guests. I ventured out of the norm and had their calzone (I added sausage) on Friday, and I loved it.

I actually prefer their lunch menu, and wish I could get one of their wonderful sandwiches with a nice light salad for dinner. If I have one complaint it's that I can't get their sandwiches from the dinner menu.

Cibo gets repeat business from me, and that says a lot.

***ENTERTAINMENT VALUE****
It's often fun to sit outside (when it's not super hot) so that you can see people trying to head North on 5th Ave (a one-way South street at that part of town).

My last time at Cibo, I witnessed a woman with her boyfriend in the passenger seat heading West on Filmore and attempting to make a right onto 5th Ave (i.e. trying to go North). The driver behind the woman laid on his horn to get her attention. The woman was completely baffled, and her passenger contorted his body around so that he could look back that the driver behind his girlfriend and give him the finger. Heading North on Filmore, driving head-on into oncoming traffic, the woman got several more honks from cars going the right way on the one-way street. She finally took the hint, pulled into a driveway, and turned around. 5 minutes later, they took a seat with their friends, seated at the table next to mine, and sheepishly admitted to their friend that they were the ones who caused all the disturbance.

Calzone with Sausage: $15. Iced Tea: $2. Witnessing a guy defend his girlfriend's honor by flipping off some guy trying to help her only to later be almost killed by on-coming traffic: Priceless.

Cibo is the only restaurant I know that provides this type of live entertainment.

NOTE: If you are looking for a quiet spot to eat, Cibo is probably not it. If you are seated in certain parts of the house, it is often hard to hear what other people at your table are saying, and the reverberations make it possible to overhear other tables' conversations. I don't view this as something that takes away from the rating... just something the diner should be aware of about the ambiance.

Also, parking is a bit of an issue. If you don't like dealing with street parking, Cibo might not be for you. I don't like dealing with street parking, but I will for Cibo.",4,3,4

On any given night at one of the valley's upscale venues, witnesses have already caught me spending 300$ for a la carte dinner. So what's the biggie about going to Cibo to drop 20$ on lunch? 

I ordered two hot vegetarian sandwiches ($9.50 ea) on saltimbocca bread and chose salad for sides. The topside of the bread was a beautiful golden brown, the bottomside was overdone. But I knew what to expect from the pictures on Yelp reviews. Still though, burnt bread is bread burnt. 

What I didn't expect is the first bite. I went in with an open mind. Hmmm. What's that familiar taste? Bread. So I took another bite towards the middle of the sandwich. A little better, I got a faint flavor of grilled veggies. But the overpowering component - bread.

SMH. Cibo, ccibo, chibo. I know y'all are all 'bout it 'bout it when it comes to your wood oven baked saltimbocca bread, but can a customer get some filling up in here? Where's the filling?! Veggies sliced thin and not generously applied across either sandwich. Sauce spread so thin that I couldn't taste it. Spread so thin, I could barely see it - the inside of the bread was still white. 

But hold on, I was sensing something. Feeling. I was feeling like you robbed me, Chibo. Come on! Forget ch'you! I'll make myself a real sandwich!

In order to even enjoy the amazing flavor of grilled veggies, I had to combine the two. But here's the sinker. When I was done combining them into one, you couldn't tell that I ever had two sandwiches. The one sammie now looked normal.

For taste, Cibo gets a 4.
For presentation, I'll give 3.
For value, the restaurant only gets a 2.

It's a little nondescript as the street holds no other restaurants, but it adds to the homey vibe. We went for simple and grabbed the cacio e pepe (a dish of noodles with pepper and parmesan that allows the homemade pasta to shine) and the Tartufata pizza. The pizza was amazing with a woodfired crust, crispy prosciutto, and the light taste of truffle oil. Definitely get it if you're a fan of white pizzas. Altogether, I loved how classic the dishes were.

As for service, it was solid. Our water was always kept filled and they were really patient when we were struggling over what to order.

This is definitely a place with a really intimate feel and is a popular date spot, as we were surrounded by parties of two. However, don't let that deter you from grabbing a bite with old friends.

The setting:  

It is on the corner of the street on 5th ave near downtown Phoenix.  It is in a house, that's right, someone's house turned into a charming little restaurant where the front yard has tons of little tables weaved around trees and patio heaters in the winter.  They also have a beautiful set up with the lights hung from the trees that gives you that intimate feel as soon as the sun hides out for the night.  On weekends you'll get some live music, calm accoustic music from nothing but reguar joe's outside on a picnic table entertaining the old fashion way, with guitars and other instruments to soothe you into the delicious food that awaits.  Inside, as soon as you walk in you notice the Chef, through a small opening, a glimpse into where the magic happens.  He is there on weekends for sure.  And yes you want to eat there while he is present. 

The food:

It was a busy friday night for us and it was FAST.  Not too fast, we did not feel rushed out of there.  The pizza's had that wood fire smell I grew up with, it reminded me of the pies this Italian man used to serve out of his van (which had a wood fire oven in it), when I was a child.  The best pizza in the world, somehow Cibo duplicated that taste and brought back some childhood memories just like Remy's ratatouille did for Igor. 

Don't miss the Buratta appertizer, big enough to share with 3 or 4 people at $14.  The cheese was simply bliss, if you love good fresh mozzarella you've had nothing yet, this buffalo moz is outstanding... creamy and perfectly balanced with grilled bread and prosciutto.  You will not be sorry.

The Burschetta Trio is also a very nice size portion, it does come in six pieces for only $10.  That's a bargain.  If you have the buratta and then taste the mozzerella on the bruschetta you will find it bland and the mozerella will taste like a cheaper cheese  so eat the bruschetta first. 
 
now to the ""Pizze""...   Just triumphant.  Don't look any further this has what you need, just keep your order simple and you will not dissapointed.

The Service: 

Folks there sound Italian, from the greetings to pronouncing things the correct way to us butcher the beautiful language.  Everything sounds and taste better when you know how it is meant to be pronouced.  They were friendly and efficient.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Italians know that if you want to sit there for a while while you eat... go for it.

Don't miss:

The burarta app and of course the pizzas.  Sit outside and enjoy the neighborhood feeling of dining in your front lawn.

REMEMBER:  If you want to try some of the best Mozzerella you've ever tasted, call in advance to see if they have Burrata in that week... They can run out of this little piece of heaven...

Cibo, you are a strong restaurant, a gem.  Keep up the good food and the tradition that flows in your menu.",3,0,3

But that was ok with us. The food is not great but probably ok for Az standards. I am a picky ex Nyer so I did not think the pizza was all that great. I could not put my finger on it. I just found it to be bland and flavorless.  The crust was doughy in some places and burnt in others.The sauce was thin. However,  I liked the fennell sausage topping. Also the calzones are huge! The crepes are a different dessert choice from your standard dessert menu served at most restaurants. They are not out of this word though. I have had better. Caprese salad, again ok but I have had better.  So in a nutshell try it. We had fun, the service was excellent, everyone was having fun. In our room most of the customers were regulars, so that is a good sign. I just did not think the food was that great. Ok for the price. Dinner was 45 bucks for dinner, apps, dessert, and coffee- not bad!Oh here is a tip- get there at 4:50pm no wait. At 6:30 there were a lot of people waiting to sit down.

There are SO many reviews, I will just give you a few tidbits that stood out to me:
- there is no chicken on the menu, so if you're going to order a salad, forget chicken.. you'll get prosciutto or sausage but no chicken... but their Omero Salad was *outstanding*.. delicious and so flavorful and great mix of textures and flavors
- place is adorable, small and intimate.. and at a 100 years old, there's no sound absorption.. my cackles were resounding... I had to purposely laugh softly (very hard for me!)... FYI
- you can do half-half pizza orders...  I tried a slice of all the 5 pizzas at our table and found them all unique, flavorful, and definitely delicious
- their Il Tagliere meat and cheese board is a fantastic appetizer idea.. burrata was outstanding and loved by all

Shared half of the hot Vegetariano (grilled red bell pepper, eggplant, zucchini and mozzarella) and the  porcellino (pulled BBQ pork and mozzarella).

""As good as Bianco!"" everybody says.  My first impression upon seeing the place was very good; for as busy as it was, it still felt small and intimate.  The 30 minute wait wasn't terrible considering the crowd, and after that, we were seated in a small corner of the house with only a few other tables in view.

When we arrived, the table on one side of us was empty, and the table on the other side had a family with a screaming baby just finishing up their meal.

When the waitress arrived, she took our orders.  I went with the marinara and a bottle of root beer.  The root beer came back barely chilled with a glass of ice.  First mistake.  Bottled soda should be served cold.  Pouring warm soda into ice leaves you with watered down soda.

At some point, someone at the table noted that we should have ordered appetizers because our food was taking so long.  Both of the other tables had received new parties, and their pizzas.  The waitress returned to apologize for our pizzas taking so long, but we must understand, there is a very large party they are serving outside.  Now, I don't like to get too philosophical when reviewing restaurants, but if the reason for the delay is a large party, why do the two tables, who were seated 5-10 minutes after us, already have their pizzas?

Eventually, of course, we received pizzas.   I noticed right away that all of the toppings could be found in a small region near one side of the pie, while entire slices contained nothing but sauce.  Clearly this was hastily assembled; no problem, I just took a few seconds to spread out the toppings.  Certainly the kitchen could have taken a little more care with my pizza.

As it turned out, the pizza was underwhelming.  It was a fine pie to be sure, but there are much better artisan pies in the valley.  If you are going to wait, you might as well go to Bianco.  If you want a crowded environment, go to Pomo.  Those places also have their issues, but they have better pizza.

Unfortunately, despite all the hype this place gets, I left with the realization that there's really no reason to come back.",1,0,0

The next time we take friends for the first time, the service is lousy, the food is average and the wine doesn't make up for it.

I feel in general it's a cool spot to hang out but for the service and food quality it is overpriced. Some time ago we happened to be there on pasta night. Apparently the chef makes all of the pasta from scratch which is cool but because it is labor intensive, they rarely have it as a special.

We started with the Antipasto Speciale (large), which was the perfect amount for four of us. 

For pizza, they'll let you do half and half, so each of the four of us picked out a pizza and then got to try one slice of each kind that we ordered. Super yummy. My fav was the Capricciosa while boyfriend was obsessed with the Salsiccia Con Patate.

We couldn't resist the dessert crepes and split two orders between the four of us. They're pretty large, so we didn't have to fight over the last bite. :) Nutella and mascarpone tasted like hot chocolate crepes (holy moly), and the fruit and mascarpone were yummy as well.

They need to invest in better quality ingredients and less in superficial ambiance and $300 painting. Not only is it low quality for the price, they forgot to season it! So bland and just really bad.

The service is great. People are nice \/ pleasant people. The ambiance of both inside and outside is excellent & so is the food. At night Cibo serves pizza (and gnocchi pasta on most Tuesday nights, call first though to ask).  On weekdays they are open for lunch and serve amazing sandwiches, the bread is based off the pizza dough. But no pizza during the day.

We love the pizza! Our favorite is the sausage \/ ""Salsiccia"". The sausage itself is exceptional. It's a thinner pizza, but not a hard crispy bottom. The sauce is not one of those over-spiced sauces, it is mellow and very fresh. They have an excellent wine selection. My favorite right now is the Barbera (spelling?) that they carry.  Just like most places, if you are there with a few people, it's a better deal to just get a bottle.

Favorite salad, the Pear Salad.  Spinach leaves, light balsamic dressing, pears and pecorino cheese (kind of like a hard parmesan cheese). It's so good!  Also anitpasto plate is also great, but getting two appetizers might be much here.

They serve crepes for desert. If you have room, go for it. If you like desert crepes, and who doesn't, you won't be disappointed. The nutella \/ banana is our fav.

I'm glad we stopped. The place is located at the end of a neighborhood. It was so odd going through residential (or maybe those businesses that look like little houses) streets and arriving at the restaurant. 

Cibo's a really cute place and it is probably super popular. The patio, at night, I can imagine is hopping and it is set up to accommodate a good amount of people (from what I remember, this was after driving 10 hours from Austin to Santa Fe and then another 8 from Santa Fe to Mesa). 

We went in the dead of the afternoon, way past lunch, and the staff was hanging out in one room and we were by ourselves in the other room. Cute place. Repetitive but it is legitimately an intriguing atmosphere because it teeters between cute and cool. I had some thin margarita pizza and I remember being a little disappointed in that the pizza itself was a little on the soggy doughy side. 

Girlfriend had... I don't remember what but she did order a huge chocolate crepe for dessert. That monster was super rich and sweet and I think at least 3 people can share it. If I wasn't staring at another 10 hour drive, I think it would have gone really well with a nice espresso.

Yelp brought me to this place and I found a little peace of heaven. 

I REALLY wish Yelp had 1\/2 stars because this place REALLY deserves 4.5 rather than 4 stars, but not quite 5, and only by the slightest of margins. Here's why: 

Jessica was our server. She was FANTASTIC! It's a rare server these days that can identify a customer's pace, adjust on the fly, and not make you feel rushed in any way on a busy weekend night - Valentines day no less. Expertly done, Jessica! 

We were unable to get a reservation, so we put our name on the waitlist. They are very technologically forward and sent a text message when out table was ready. The allowed us to wait in areas other than the benches, the tiny house's foyer or the cramped bar. As we were waiting a musician began to play by the fire pit and we migrated there to listen. He was a wonderful choice, and it was quite an enjoyable wait time as much as wait times can be enjoyable. 

Once we were seated at our lovely table and someone brought us water (she wasn't the friendliest), Jessica then arrived, introduced herself and explained the menu. 

We started with the charcuterie board. It wasn't the best I'd ever had, but it was wonderful nonetheless and a good way to begin a lovely dinner. 

As I mentioned, my intent on visiting Cibo was to replace a horrible experience with another pizza place that will not be named. Therefore, I originally had come for the pizza, but I wound up with the pasta. I was not disappointed! The pasta itself was fresh and made in house, the sauce was subtle and amazing. The hubby got the pizza so I was still able to taste the pizza. It was very good and we had no leftovers. Which meant we were either famished or gluttonous as the servings are quite generous. Either way, we enjoyed our meals immensely. 

My 1\/2 point deduction is really because of the bar and alcohol choices. To some this might sound nit picky, I agree, but it really bothered me. Their wine list and liquor list was surprisingly small and limited. I understand the difficulties in keeping a fully stocked bar and an extensive selection of wines - I'm not suggesting that. However, the selections they did have could have been chosen much better - better Italian wines, both red and white, and amoretto is a must. They do redeem themselves slightly with a HOMEMADE lemoncello. 

The ambiance, the music, the food, the service, were all superb. Making a very minor adjustment and choosing better selections in the wine and liquor department will make an enormous difference. 

Regardless, we will be back. If you haven't been, it's time to check them out!",0,0,0

tried a salad, too, which was fresh though heavy on the vinegar in the dressing. also tried the bruschetta. the bread was good, but not as good as that of lamp pizzeria in north scottsdale, or second runner up ( bread-wise), pizzeria bianco. the bruschetta comes in a gigantic portion. three large, thick slices of bread split in half. one with buffalo mozzarella and a meat that looked like proscuitto (didn't try that one), one slice with grape tomatoes and basil (awkward to eat because the halved grape tomatoes are small and kept falling off), one with a cannellini bean and eggplant spread. this antipasti alone is very filling and i regret eating so much of it (especially the savory cannellini bruschetta) before the perfect pizzas arrived.

First of all, though;

If you are on a gluten free diet and want pizza YOU HAVE TO GO HERE!

And now:

The staff was brilliant, up to and including making sure our water never ran out.

The atmosphere outside was festive without being overwhelming. The inside was cramped and too loud... but if you line the party atmosphere it's 199-% you.

The food was perfectly done and arrived at the table right on time. The beer was wonderful (I had an oatmeal around from a brewery in Tucson). At one point Ton thought he had served me the wrong beer, so he was going to buy me what I had ordered. I checked and it was what I had ordered... but he bought me another round anyway.

My girl ordered the calzone - which was huge, fillings in a perfect balance and perfectly done.

I ordered the Diavolo, I believe - gluten free.

If you are on a gluten free diet and want pizza YOU HAVE TO GO HERE! I would t have known it was GF. It was incredible. Damn near miraculous.

Not cheap, but worth every penny. 2 people with all the trimmings will hit you for a Benjamin... but when the prosciutto and tomatoes are imported from Italy you know it's an awesome value.

EASY 5 stars. Good job, Tom! :)",0,0,0

The pizzas were good but not what i expected when i hear thin crust.  The ingredients were definately quality but the crust was a little fluffy and chewy for my taste.

Cibo came to mind, and we discovered their wonderful, private carriage house. 

It's located right behind the restaurant, and it's perfect for groups of 30 or less. It's everything you love about Cibo--delicious food, attentive service and cute ambiance. Inside, the Carriage House features exposed brick walls, wine racks, a cool bar and art created by local artists. Outside, there's a private patio with string lighting, cozy seating and a fire pit. Oh, and there's a private bathroom, too. 

Michelle at Cibo helped us coordinate the evening, and she was super helpful. We chose a menu that featured an antipasti, a couple of delicious pizzas of our choice, and a sweet nutella crepe for desert. The food, of course, was amazing, and the service was even better. We had a dedicated bartender\/server for our group of 20. She was awesome, and made sure our wine glasses were never empty, which was critical for our group of lushes. 

The cost was also really reasonable. There was a fee of $50 to reserve the private carriage house, and the cost per person was a steal. The in-laws were hosting the dinner, so I don't know the exact price, but I think the food was around $25-30\/pp, excluding beer and wine. 

If you're looking for a casual place to hold your next private event, I highly encourage you to check out Cibo's carriage house. So, so awesome.",1,0,0

At first they were very accommodating, they let us see the room and discuss how we were going to set it up for our party and went over the menu's with us. It came as a big surprise to me when we showed up and had to wait over an hour and a half for our first course to come out! Everything just went downhill from there. We complained to our server multiple times (we had 1 server for a party of 40) that the room was extra hot and there was nothing done about it. I had about 10 guests having to get up to try and cool down outside, fanning themselves and sweating throughout the dinner. Then when half of our guests left I realized they never sent out dessert and we had to ask for it! I was then told we should have requested dessert to come out, what kind of restaurant waits 45 minutes to bring dessert after a meal is finished?

My BIGGEST disappointment was how the catering manager, Michelle, handled everything after I sent her an email. I understand that she is the owner's wife but I've had teenagers talk to me nicer than she did. She was brash and offensive. Not only did she not take blame for anything she blamed our party for all of the issues. You can count on the fact that I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone and will have negative things to say when asked; which is unfortunate because I work downtown and a lot of people always ask me for recommendations.

I came during happy hour (ends at 6PM) where they had house wine for $4\/glass and many affordable appetizers. The happy hour menu is also really cute - the original is hand drawn and quite colorful.

I started with the Arancini appetizer ($4\/4 arancini) - Arancini are rice balls stuffed with some mozzarella and then deep fried. When it got brought out I was surprised by how large they were, they were each about 2 inches in diameter! The mozzarella was nice and gooey on the inside and the marinara sauce completes it.

Gnocchi alla Sorrentina ($6) - the gnocchi could have been slightly fluffier but overall the flavor was good. The basil and the tomato sauce were nicely balanced. There was a decent amount of cheese which melted and made the dish an interesting mix of textures of flavors.

Linguine Puttanesca ($16) - You can order their hand made pasta starting from 5PM. It was highly recommended by the waitress so I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed! The pasta was perfectly al dente, it had just enough of a bite. The black olives are not your usual olives, they were the perfect complement to a mouthful of handmade pasta. The fresh ground black pepper and large grain salt also helps to elevate the flavor.",0,0,0

Everything I've tried on the menu is excellent, they offer such a generous happy hour, and service is professional. There are quite a few lauded Italian restaurants in the vicinity, but none come close to Cibo in my opinion. 

The interior feels like a renovated cottage, complete with cute doorways and cozy tables. Space is a little cramped, but nothing compared to San Francisco restaurants, and I think the strategically-placed stained glass and doorways really help to increase the feeling of privacy between tables. It gets packed here very quickly during dinnertimes, but parking usually isn't too bad since there's plenty of street parking on the side streets. 

Meatballs (happy hour menu):
I've never found an Italian meatball dish that I've enjoyed until Cibo's version. There is such an amazing balance of meatiness and flavor so that the meatballs don't feel heavy. They're cooked to perfection, so no overcooked ground meat leaving that sort of dry, powdery taste after some chewing. The red sauce ladled on top is savory and complex, and it's a delight to fork off a little bit of the meatball, place it on top of the nicely toasted bread, and top it off with an additional spoonful of the red sauce. This dish is so good I ordered a second after we had polished off the first one, and I bet that it won't be the last time I do that. 

Gnocchi (happy hour menu):
When I took my first bite of this gnocchi dish, I don't think I knew how to react for a few seconds. I could taste the freshness of the potato, the softness of the gnocchi, the complexity in flavor of the tomato cream sauce that was made with fresh ingredients, and the creaminess of cheese. It was the first time that I'd understood why gnocchi is often described as ""little potato pillows,"" and all the components of this dish elevated it to something I would expect at a fancy Italian restaurant, not on a happy hour menu. I was not only impressed with the preparation of this dish, but also the fact that such care was taken to make a happy hour menu dish. 

Fried dough spheres with nutella (happy hour menu):
These mini-donut holes are freshly fried and dusted with sugar. Dunking them in the nutella yields a decadently-chocolatey churro bite. They are a bit heavy, but that's to be expected considering they are.. fried balls of dough. 

Di Notte (white sauce):
The spicy salame is pretty darn spicy in my opinion, but it complimented the creaminess of the white sauce and flavor of the cheese very well. I liked that the dough was chewy in the center and wood-fired crunchy towards the ends. The dough was definitely fresh, as I could detect the fragrance of fresh flour. 

Da Vinci (red sauce):
I personally prefer the red sauce pizzas, as they boast of a well-balanced red sauce that has both notes of saltiness and tanginess. This cuts the heaviness of the cheese on top nicely, and wish a fresh sprinkling of basil, I felt like I could continue eating this pizza even after I was full. 

Berry crepe with marscapone: 
Warm, decadent, and well-balanced with the acidity of the berries and creaminess of the marscapone. The crepe itself is thin and elastic as opposed to cakey and airy, but I think it goes extremely well with the fresh berries and marscapone. This is hands down the perfect palate cleansing dessert after a flavorful meal, and I'd order it again and again.

I haven't had a chance to try the special pasta dishes offered each day of the week, but if they're anything like the rest of the menu, I'm sure they'll be delightful.",18,7,14

We got there a little early to get a table and right away I was taken with how the restaurant looks as we walked up to it.  With all the white lights, outdoor seating, and the pretty bungalow, it felt very welcoming and a much appreciated respite from the typical strip mall setting.  

We were greeted and seated right away by the host, and our server, Jessica, was there right away to take our drink and app orders.  Since it was still happy hour I took advantage of those great deals and ordered the Straccetti ($4) and the Polpette ($6).  We also ordered a glass of house red, which I think is a montepulciano, or maybe a sangiovese...I don't know.  Both are fun to say and it was only four bucks.

Those apps are both 5 star!  I aspire to make a meatball that good.  Flavorful, moist, and accompanied by a nice red sauce and some crusty bread.  The Straccetti are completely addictive and I highly recommend those as well.  The little touches of fresh basil ribbons and slivers of fresh parmigiano just made that one even more perfect.  I would order both of those again anytime.  Delicious!

My husband ordered the calzone and I thought, for almost 15 bucks, that better be one damn good calzone, and it was!  Absolutely excellent blending of flavors and it's huge.  It made for some great leftovers the next day.  The best item we ordered.  

Tim and I decided to order 2 pizzas to share and the pizza margherita disappeared in a hurry.  Simple, and perfectly done.  Now, the pizza rustica on the other hand was better as leftovers because it was underdone when it was brought to us.  I am familiar with the fork and knife style of pizza, but as I tried to take a slice of this one, the crust just kind of smeared across the pan and was almost gooey even though it was very thin.  The prosciutto was good quality, but because it was underdone as well, its flavors really didn't come alive.  An edge of crust was burnt, which is fine if the rest of the pizza is done, but the middle and the overall pizza was not completely finished.  

I warmed it up the next day in a hot oven on a stone, and then it still had that chewy crust consistency, but the great flavor of the prosciutto was there.  The arugula was wonderful.  Fresh and peppery as it should be.  They were extremely busy, which was expected, and I think they took that one out of the oven just a minute or two too soon.  No complaints, but it was noticeable that it was undercooked.  I am a big fan of leftovers so it was not a big deal.  

Jessica took good care of us and we had a great time.  I would most definitely make a return trip to Cibo.",5,3,4

Every member of staff was dressed in raggedy clothes and they didn't look very happy at all either. The majority of them were frowning... our waitress was nice and smiled a lot but looked stoned and reeked of bad b.o. (yes it's hot in AZ but try to prudently refresh yourself every hour or so if you know you're getting sweaty). We waited 10+ minutes to be greeted by her despite her coming to check on the tables right next to us. Her service through the night was very erratic and left a lot to be desired.

We ordered the lasagna as an appetizer and a Salsiccia pizza for dinner but the pizza came out first! Needless to say I was very irritated that a pre-made lasagna failed to make its way out of the kitchen before a pizza.

The pizza was barely above average. The fennel sausage and the mozzarella were good but the crust and sauce didn't prove to be anything memorable. There are far superior places in the valley including one just blocks away and even a nationwide brand of pizzerias so to not even beat out a large chain was very disappointing.

The lasagna offered nothing special and was quite worthless being ordered as an appetizer but arriving after the entree.

Bland food, low staff morale, and terrible service just made for a bad experience and with these many problems in one night I didn't even want to waste my time giving a manager feedback. I just wanted to run out as fast as possible.",6,4,2

I really enjoy a good pie, as most of us do.  Lately, I've been finding myself at Cibo.  I use to fequent another spot in the Phoenix area for my pizza cravings however, that has all changed. 

So if your searching for  authentic Italian food, at  a reasonable price.  Look no further Cibo is the place for you. 

Every pizza on the menu at Cibo looks amazing. I cant wait to try them all.  So far my favorotes are the Salsiccia and and Diavola.  However, I would be neglectful if I  didn't' mention the calzones which are absolutely delicious, the best I ever had.

You have to start your meal with one  of Cibo's aperterisers.  Try the Arancini or Burrata, its more than enough for two people.  Cibo offers a modest  wine list at prices that  won't make you cringe  when you see them.  

The serving sizes at Cibo are very generous, however that didn't stop us from ending the night with a fruit crepe which was more than enough for two people.


The service at Cibo is second to none. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating. If your looking for amazing food and service, stop by you won't be disappointed.",7,2,4

I am not a huge Italian food fan but I was VERY impressed with the quality of this restaurant.   I tried my son's homemade pasta and it was unbelievable.  I've never had homemade pasta but once I tried it I knew it was homemade.  I love that the portions weren't HUGE (which is one of the reasons why I don't like going to Italian restaurants--they put way too much food on the plate including something as filling as pasta).  It was just the right amount for an adult.  The pizza was delicious.  Again, even on the pizza, everything tasted super fresh and homemade.  The only thing that I didn't love was the marinated veggies.  It was a bit too tart.  I'm not knocking the restaurant because I figured that it was just my own issue with a dish that is a traditional starter.  

The other thing that I didn't care for (which has nothing to do with the food at the restaurant) was the route that my family (hubby and two boys) took to get there.  We walked there from our hotel in downtown Phoenix.  Not sure that was a great idea, looking back.  Lots of homeless people wandering the streets and the main street that the restaurant sits on has some low-income housing that was a little scary looking.  Also, having that fraternity house right across the restaurant with these rowdy frat boys screaming things at the patrons as they walked into the restaurant wasn't ideal.  But the food was yummy.  I'd go back.  But I'd take a cab next time.  :)  

Absolutely worth it to check it out.",2,1,2

I'd probably get a lighter one to go with it next time. Their pizza with arugula and walnuts perhaps (La Noce maybe? I can't remember all the actual pizza names).

I work in a restaurant and am very patient as I understand that sometimes shit happens. We order a bottle of wine and a salad and 2 pizzas. He says he'll be back with the beer and the wine and we are totally patient at this point. After about 15 minutes we are still sitting there waiting for our drinks. I can see the bar from where I'm sitting and there is no beer or wine in the service well so it's not like he is too busy to grab it he just never rang any of it in.

It is *not* a place that tries to do deep dish or thick(er) crusts like they do back in Chicago. Lou Malnati's will always rule the day in that department, with Gino's East running a close second (and Giordano's a close third!) 

But as far as straight-up Italian pizza is concerned, Cibo is as close as I've had since coming back from Naples.

First, their pesto salad: Excellent. Fresh greens, intensely flavored tomatoes, and sheets upon sheets of parmaggiano reggiano, which one can never have too much of. The basil tasted fresh, the olive oil had character, and they didn't spare on the pine nuts.

The pizza came soon after. We had the salsiccia con patate, a pizze bianche with potatoes, mozzarella and spicy sausage. Once again the ingredients were top notch and melded nicely, the sausage in particular having a great, complex flavor. The mozzarella melted perfectly and wasn't rubbery or greasy.

Ah, but the crust. It was thin and slightly charred on the bottom, like it should be. The dough had some ""give"", and chewing through the toppings brought an interior that was soft and had excellent texture. It should take two hands to eat this pizza. Very well done.

The interior of the restaurant can be loud, (very loud, depending on the intoxication of present company) and they're usually very busy. We had to wait 45 minutes for our table, and the weather outside was certainly threatening to pour at any moment (although it didn't). ""Urban"" also seems to have a different connotation, since the restaurant sure seems like it's in a low-density, suburban part of town (that happens to be a mile away from downtown Phoenix).

The BF and I went here before seeing Louis CK for our anniversary. We were seated right away, so that was nice, but it was like 5:45 so that isn't too shocking. We sat outside, which was nice and had pretty christmas lights on all of the trees. The waiter comes by after about 5 minutes and asks us for drinks or apps and we ordered the burrata as an app. The menu said it was topped with a balsamic glaze, which sounded wonderful. We were also ready to order our pizza but the waiter disappeared immediately after taking our app order. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And I swear it felt like it was a half hour, but it was probably more like 10-15 minutes later (we were super hungry) the waiter came back to take our pizza order. We ordered the La Noce and he left. Well.... we waited some more. Finally got our burrata and it was a mess. Two giant globs of cheese with the lightest drizzle of balsamic dressing (not vinegar, because there is no way this weak stuff was straight up vinegar) surrounded by bread and prosciutto. It was large, so I'll give them that.... but too large in my opinion, because there isn't enough bread for the toppings. The burrata was good, creamy.... but it didn't taste like balsamic at all, which was the most appealing part of the app. The prosciutto was alright... it didn't have a ton of flavor, but it was fine. The bread had a burnt flavor... not my fave. Then we wait about 20 minutes.... waiter did not check on us.... Finally get the pizza. The pizza was good. That was the redeeming item of the night. It had arugula, walnut, ricotta, and mozz. It was a tasty combination.

 Now, the whole time we were there, there was a table of about 6-8 extremely loud, drunk, possibly old sorority girls sitting near us. All we could hear is their conversation, so much so, that we knew one girl was named rochelle and one was Tina and one had been divorced for 4 years and they had a friend named Lori who was just sooo crazy among many other details that we should not have gathered from sitting in their proximity, which obviously puts a damper on the experience. The waiter was so occupied with them, that we felt forgotten about all night. He was not attentive, he did not ask how things were, and he disappeared for long periods of time to go do who knows what for this other table (they had a bunch of ridiculous requests like splitting the bill 6-8 ways when the menu says they don't do that... hmmm). We sat down at 5:45 and barely got out of there around 7 to make it to our show (we were walking). So the experience wasn't a good one, BUT I would be willing to try it again, as I did have a very nice lunch there a few years ago.",2,2,1

After trying a few pizzas, I can't pick a favorite. Each one is made so well, with such delicious and fresh ingredients, that it's hard to go wrong. I guess if you pick a pizza with ingredients you hate, it won't be good, but probably not any fault of Cibo.

Happy hour is really nice. Cheap house wine and Italian beer, plus a sample of food items. The gnocchi is fantastic - really wonderful and great to split with a couple people. In terms of appetizers, it's so hard to beat the caprese. The seasoning on the tomatoes is out of this world. It's my favorite caprese in Phoenix.

Again, if you aren't huge on Nutella, dessert might be a bit challenging. That being said, I love sharing a strawberry and Nutella crepe with my husband at the end of a meal at Cibo. It's so good... so good.  Can't really describe it any other way.",2,0,2

I have recently been to Cibo during a business trip in Phoenix, actually thanks to Madonna. Yes, that night a Madonna concert made all places busy in downtown, so, thanks to my colleague who yelped Cibo, we went there. The staff was very friendly, and our waitress was sweet. 

My colleagues ordered some pasta that looked great, but those were somewhat small portions. 

I ordered my favorite pizza: aragula, shaved parmesan, and prosciutto crudo. Maybe this is not a popular combination here in the US, but...did I mention I am Italian? I guess I did...

So, to be concise... my pizza was a 5 star Pizza. I thought I was in Rome or something! But no, no, I was in Phoenix Arizona, USA. 

Are you still reading my review???? GO GO GO...Cibo is awesome!

OK since you are not that hungry, I want to talk about their patio. Actually, calling it patio reduces its awesomeness. It is a true Italian ""giardino,"" it reminded me of my summer vacations in Italy.

The only downside is that in their menu there is a typo on an Italian word... LOL...

When I travelled to Phoenix on business and asked the Phoenix yelpers where to go, I was a little surprised so many people said Cibo. I was even more surprised when I saw how many reviews it had. Well, Phoenix, I understand now. I have seen the light. You have converted me to Ciboism.

It's. Phenomenal.

The location is in a neighborhood and it's obviously a converted house where the outdoor seating is actually on the front lawn with some nice lights in the trees. Very cool to sit outside on a cool night in Phoenix and enjoy great company and delicious food!

When I was looking at the menu I was so excited to see so many options for Pizza Biancha (white pizza!). I can't eat tomatoes so it was like a kid in a candy store for me. Once I saw the Di Notte I knew it had to be mine. A huge portion, wood fired pizza with fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola and mozzarella cheeses along with spicy salami. It was to die for. I enjoyed it at the table AND I enjoyed the leftovers. My co-workers even stole a slice each and couldn't stop ooo'ing and aah'ing over it.

One of my co-workers got a meatball sub which he swore up and down was as good as his authentic-from-Italy grandmother's. He said it might be sacriledge to say it, but it was true. My other co-worker had a half vegetarian and half ham and she said the whole thing was delicious.

For dessert, even though we were full, we couldn't pass up the opportunity to try the Nutella & Marscapone crepe. It was a warm crepe filled with nutella and marscapone cheese, covered in powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate sauce, with a dollop of ice cream. It was sinfully delicious.

Try the calzone and one of their great salads (i'm partial to the Omero but the Pear Salad is wonderful as well).

I live in Scottsdale\/PV so never thought there was a reason to go ""downtown"".  Boy was I wrong.   

While vetting out a location for our rehearsal dinner we dined at a few cool spots downtown, one of which was Cibo. Coming from Chicago I consider myself a pizza snob\/aficionado so it takes a little bit to impress me.  I was drooling over Cibo's menu before we even arrived, and they did not disappoint.  First of all, the restaurant and patio are just freaking adorable. I had no idea Phoenix offered neighborhoods such as the one Cibo is located in. Rows of cute bungalow homes just like back home! And located in one on the corner, there is Cibo!  What a romantic, special setting.  

On my first visit, the server was knowledgeable about the menu, ingredients, as well as the vino.  I like that they use local and organic ingredients mixed with authentic Italian items that are imported and impossible to duplicate.  We started with the Ostia salad which I am now obsessed with and have tried unsuccessfully to duplicate at home.  The chickpea dressing was so well balanced, and the crispy parsnips on top were such a creative was to add crunch.  We ordered both a red and a white pizza, because we just couldnt decide. The pizza crust was just the right mix of crunch and chew, and the toppings and cheese were fresh and flavorful.

Ahhhhh and the Nutella Crepes. So simple yet so divine. Warm crepes stuffed with Nutella with a scoop of ice cream. Hard to find anything wrong with that.

So midway through my 3rd glass of vino the decision was made - we were going to host our wedding rehearsal dinner here.  We asked them to show us the location, which could not have been more perfect. Private parties can be hosted in what is basically a guest house converted into a party room. It was just too cute for words, needed little decoration, and has a bar, private bathroom, and a great patio. They told us they were planning to host small weddings in the space as well.

The service that I received with regard to our rehearsal was great. Michelle was quick to respond to my questions and I really appreciated her guidance on the menu as we had a few vegan\/vegetarians in our party. 

The value of hosting our dinner there was fantastic.  Our $20\/pp package included house salads, a trio of bruschetta choices, a variety of pizzas, and those Nutella crepes I had been dreaming about.   To keep costs in check we decided to serve soft drinks and a selection of a couple of beers and wines for our guests to chose from . All in all, with gratuity and drinks included the bill was around $1000 for about 30 people, which I felt was a great value. The bartender and wait staff made sure everyones waters and drinks were full, and the timing of the service was great. 

Our friends and family raved about the location and food, and had a blast enjoying the beautiful evening weather on the private patio.

Cibo will always hold great memories of a fantastic night with friends and family, and I look forward to my next visit to this little treasure. I have yet to go to Bianco despite all I have read, but honestly would have a hard time justifying waiting in line and dealing with all the hoopla involved with dining there when I know Cibo is around the corner and well deserving of my business.",10,2,5

From the Pizza Bianche: Siena - mozzarella and zucchini, topped with spek and
pecorino cheese.    ahhh!  the cheese, the crunch of the zucchini.  Spek (or hold this if you aren't a fan of spek, i like it both ways).    Course 3 =  Ding Ding! 

From the Pizza Rosse: Diavola - tomato sauce, mozzarella and
spicy salame.   You simply can't go wrong here.

Crepe -  I suggest the Fresca, but you really can't go wrong with any crepe on the menu.   Course 4 = Heavenly

Myself and 2 firends. 3x's ive been here and its always busy. the other two x's we attempted to eat here. We didnt want to wait, so we went some where eles to eat. Last nite we waited for about 30minutes.  We were seated inside. and quickly ordered. I had the omero salad, one firend had sausage pizza and a glase of wine, and the other had pear salad. 
Ok food arrived promptly. my salad was good a bit on the small side for 11 dollars, but had lots of greens and onions, strawberries, and walnuts. it was good. my only complaint would be the candied walnuts........... couldnt even taste the walnuts too much sugar. When mentioned this too the waittress; She informed me that i could of requested plain raw walnuts and without any problem they could replace the candied walnuts with raw ones. That was nice to know. for the next time. My two firends both loved their food. I just thought mine and my firends salad were on the small side for 11 and 12 dollars. Other then that. Every thing at Cibo was very good. i recommend giving this establishment a try. I will be back. Just be prepared to spend 20 dollars or more. per person. Also depending on what time of day you go, be prepared to wait for a seat very popular with the  local folk. Lots of parties and groups coming and going. They serve wine and beer. not a full bar.  good place for eye candy of the both sexes. All ages here young and old.  Very nice atmosphere.

Our waiter was on top of things, from taking drink and food orders, to bringing the cake out (we were there for a birthday).  He even said the menu items in a very distinct Italian accent, which always makes me giggle a little bit on the inside.  Tell me you've never said ""It's a me, Mario!"" in your best Italian accent.  When I went to the bathroom to wash up (the men and women bathrooms are single occupancy), one of the waitresses told me to just hop in the women's if it was empty.  Little things like this really help to give this place a cozy, inviting feeling.

On to the food.  The pizza was pretty good (though I found the crust to be a bit on the salty side), and the appetizers were excellent.  I had the geneva, which consists of basil pesto, potatoes, white onions, parmigiano and probably some other stuff that I don't remember.  But it was good.

Table of 2.
You will never run short on water as they give you a bottle on your table and promptly replace it when its out.

I got banana nutella crepes.
Additional: Vanilla ice cream ($2) and whipped cream ($2).
I wasn't told about the additional charges till the bill was presented. Surprised bunny.
$7 for the crepe, $2 for ice cream, and $2 more for whipped cream. Total 11 USD before tax and tip.

Food came out kind of slow, but it was a busy friday night.


The pizza ""Latina"" was okay,... I had better. All the toppings fell right off, including the cheese.
The crust was puffy and airy, and the center was extremely thin.

The server was tall handsome lanky and friendly.

The venue was loud alive, lots of ppl, had a lot of flies too, even indoors.

I liked how the windows opened to let outside air in.

It looks like a house was converted into a restaurant. The red bricks are charming.
The lawn\/garden \/patio is welcoming.

I had heard good things about Cibo in the past so I was a bit confused by the less-than-stellar reviews showing up lately but decided to give it a chance anyway and I couldn't be happier I did. The evening's weather was beautiful so my date and I sat out on the patio. Twinkling string lights and lush plant life complimented by the trickling of a few water features really helped set the mood. Giving the patio almost a Naples feel to it. 

We decided to order the caprese salad to split and a couple pizzas (one veggie, one mushroom) to share. First out came the salad and I was already impressed after the first bite. The tomatoes were sweet and juicy and the mozzarella tasted so fresh I swear I heard it moo. Next came the pizza. Now, understand, I consider myself a bit of a pizza snob so It takes a pretty good pie to impress me. That being said, Cibo impressed the hell out of me! The crust was airy and elastic with that perfect rustic baking taste. Again, the fresh mozzarella and ripe tomatoes made an appearance and with the addition of our toppings I was a happy man. I only wish I wasn't such a hog so I could have saved some for lunch the next day. 

The only reason I couldn't give Cibo a five star rating was the service. Although our server was as nice and the food came out timely, there was a definite lack of attention. We were in a bit of A time crunch and I had to end up tracking her down to ask for the tab, then again to actually pay it.

We weren't expecting it to be in a home, but it added to the charm. We ordered the burrata appetizer which had a ton of the cheese but not enough bread so ordered extra bread. Last time I had burrata at a restaurant the cheese was warm which I enjoyed... it was cold here but that is fine. I'm not sure what the norm is for serving it. 

Sadly, we didn't enjoy the pizza very much. We ordered it half ""Tricolore"" and half ""Tartufata"" -- the tartufata side was heavy on the truffle oil and a bit too strong\/oily for me. The tricolore was okay.  If I were to come again (if I ever visit Arizona again) I think I would try the pizza Rosses over the Bianches. The bianches just sounded fantastic (these had no sauces).

Our waiter was nice. I felt bad for him trying to explain the special as it took well over a minute to describe just the soup.

It's interesting, and HIDDEN to say the least, I must have driven up and down 3 streets before finding the little place.

The patio was packed for lunch so I opted to sit inside and catch up on some news while sipping on a Palagrino, the server recommended the hot Italian sausage sandwich with the house salad, being that I had never been to Cibo, I followed it and was soon in love with the aroma, tangy spices and uniqueness which danced on my palate.

Outdoor seating - 5 star
I'm not gonna lie, the outdoor seating is so romantic and beautiful with the trees and lights around!

Caprese Salad - 2.5 star
Not a good experience, the mozzarella was not soft, can't taste the freshness at all...$10 for four big piece of white yet no flavored cheese,,such a mistake.the tomato tasted much better on the other hand...and hello, are you running out of olive oil? I can barely see a few drops on the bottom of the plate...

Salsicca con Patate - 3 star
Pizza with mozzarella, sausage and roasted potatoes. It was surprisingly good for the first slice, the potatoes were soft, cheese was melting, and sausage was pretty tasty...but that's because I never had it before, starting my 2nd slice, I realized that no sauce pizza can mean tasteless, the flavor started losing...err, can I have some chili pepper?

Fresca (crepe) - 5 star!!!!
This would be my only reason to go back if I did..thin crepes with fresh kiwi, strawberries, peach, vanilla ice cream and whip cream! Yum!!! It was heaven for any crepe lover! Must try!!
 
Service - 2 star
The place seemed to be very busy yet I only see one real waitress that was running around to take orders, the rest were just servers who don't talk to you....we spent so much time to wait for her to come, to bring us a menu, or just deliver the check....

Wait - 4 star
Compare to Bianco, the wait is short. We arrived around 7:30pm on a Saturday, the wait was only about 15min,,sweet! But the indoor seating was kinda squeezed in...

So it comes to a 3.58 average..I had a much higher expectation when read the previous reviews, meh, I hate to admit, but I definitely love Bianco and LGO a lot more..",3,2,2

This is a great place for sharing. My favorite night at Cibo goes like this...
The delicious pesto salad. ( I am not usually a big salad person but this one is quite interesting.)
Then on to the pizza. I generally get the margherita pizza but had the diavola the other day and now I am hooked.
For desert all of the crepes are amazing.
And if you've never had limoncello I highly recommend you try it!

The pictures make the place look more luxurious than what I saw in person (see pic 3 of 83). The second we started to enter 5th Ave (the street it's on), the entire surroundings was seedy. 

When we were driving we saw a restaurant that we thought MIGHT have been Cibo, but it had gang signs written all on the front cement walls of the building and the side back walls were starting to peel. 

We thought ""this couldn't be it"". Sure enough, it was. They may have excellent food and great service, but I was hoping some of the ratings or reviews might've hinted towards the unsettling feeling of the area. My girlfriend and I felt unsafe leaving our nicer car in the area to enjoy a meal.

Its OK. The pizza that has pears and arugula on it was good the very first time we went but this time was just LOADED with arugula and they put it on right before bringing it out vs right after it came out of the oven. So it never wilted. The pizza just didn't seem very fresh and was fairly dry.

We also had the antipasto and it was fairly lackluster with unripened olives all over. Huge ratio of olives to everything else. A bit stingy with the meat.

Service was sterile. Still not sure who our server was. We probably had 3-4 diff people come by from time to time. Had to get up and find someone to ask for a check. Being seated outside here you really feel like you're fairly forgotten about.

It's always been one of my favorite spots. The patio is incredibly cool, and a great place for a date, inside is no less cool and is awesome in decor. All the old bedrooms making the dining rooms is awesome. Antipasta is great, and pizza has always been great. I do take out here a lot and never mind eating inside either. 

Last night though, was my first visit in months, and it is just not the same. The pizza was overly doughy, and lacked that crisp wood fired taste and texture. The sauce wasn't the same, as it tasted very bitter in comparison to prior visits. I ordered the Salsicca and what used to seem like a high quality pizza, no longer did. The sausage was some sort of ground meat like substance, compared to what I remember being a high quality sliced sausage. Their wine list has changed since my last visit, and now only has one Cabernet... a rather shitty one at that. My friend had a white pizza that she enjoyed, though my observations about it were mostly the same as though it had gone downhill. 

I can't tear into the place though, as the atmosphere is too perfect. Service is spectacular as well, and though I'm bitching about the pizza, it's still great pizza. It's just not what I remember... maybe I've been eating Metro and Bianco too much lately.",2,2,2

Starting with the place itself: it's home-y, well-lit, well-decorated, and just all-around cozy. It used to be an old house, and it definitely shows. Great patio seating, as well.

The food is next, and holy mackerel was it good. We got polenta fries and salads to start with. The salads had delicious and fresh ingredients, as well as gorgeous displays. I got the pesto salad, and would highly recommend it.
For entrees, my parents got a white pizza, and I split the pulled pork sandwich. Both were delectable, and we all had food left over to bring home.

The kicker is that they comped our desserts (about $15 worth). They said it was because they made us wait too long in between appetizers and entrees. It was a bit of a wait, but nothing crazy! The desserts were so good, too. The 'fresca' is a crepe with ice cream in the  middle, topped with fruit and whipped cream.

I'm glad I went with my instinct, the pie was perfectly cooked and the flavors were out of sight.  

Add to this an ice cold bottle of Peroni - and I was quite pleased with my decision.  Between this and Pomo, I'm convinced that it's the best couple of pies within a half mile anywhere in AZ.  COME EAT HERE!  You won't regret it.

Tucked away in what seems to be a residential neighborhood, Cibo transforms its early 1900's bungalow into a legitimate contender for the best pizzeria in town. If you're looking for great pizza and a great ambience for date night, your search ends here.

The pizza itself is heavily Neapolitan styled, but has a few small twists on the classic VPN formula. It's most distinguishing feature is its tomato sauce, which features a slightly muted tomato flavor. Cutting down on the bright acidity typically found in Neapolitan pizza, the sauce allows other elements of the pizza to come forward. I don't know if ""sweeter"" is the right word, but there seems to be a something that takes out the highest end of the tomato bite. It'll be a hit with every type of pizza fan. 

The other elements of the pizza do come forward and do not disappoint. I tasted the fresh mozzarella more on this pizza than on other local places. Cibo finds a good balance where the sauce is not overtaking the milder flavor of the cheese, which is perfectly melted without starting to brown. The basil on the pizza works just slightly better when the cheese is brought to the front of the flavor too. It's just a really tasty combination that just works on this pizza to slightly different level than on similar pies. 

The crust was probably the weakest point of my visit. Of the two pizzas I tried, one was overcooked and one was undercooked, which was strange. I like a good amount of char, but one half of the pie was dark brown\/black. The undercooked pizza had the beginnings of leopard spotting but was too soft on the bottom. Looking around the room, I saw plenty of well-done pizzas, so the oven was working well that night, I just got a couple of duds. The flavor of the crust was pretty average, and I felt like there was a chance for more flavor development. Maybe better texture would have been enough to satisfy me though. I will note that I've been here many times and this is the first time I've had this issue, so I won't ding the star count (though this visit would have been a 4\/5). I'm also not personally a fan of pizzas where the center of the pizza is wetter and soggier- I prefer a crispier crust throughout. The pizzas at Cibo trend closer to soggy than crispy in the very middle. 

I tried the Margherita on this visit, and I've had other offerings with different cured meats on top. All of them excel, but the Margherita is my favorite; it's possibly my favorite Margherita downtown. The antipasto board is also fantastic, as was the house bread and Nutella crepe dessert. Service was average but the ambience is wonderful, especially if you sit outside where there is frequently a live musician. 

Cibo might not be VPN certified, but their style of Neapolitan pizza is a must-try for Phoenix pizza lovers. I've yet to be disappointed by anything I ordered off their menu.

I love everything about it: the phenomenal pizza, the beautiful decor, the on-top-of-things servers and the charming neighborhood location -- it's a must-try, for sure!

Cibo is in a historic home-turned-restaurant, with the most gorgeous twinkly light-lit patio (there are misters, so you can even sit here during the summer.) The interior is just as cute, with a small bar overlooking the open kitchen churning out perfect wood-fired pizzas. There's also an area that overlooks the backyard garden, and the rest of the inside seating is quaint and cozy -- you'll most likely be sat close to another table, so prepare to get intimate.

The obvious menu draw here is the pizza, and they're pretty close to perfect. You can get pizzas for dinner (their lunch menu consists mostly of sandwiches and salads.) 

A single pizza alone is a huge meal for one (though I can happily finish one myself and still manage to gobble up some dessert), so consider splitting an appetizer and sharing a pie. My favorite kind to get is a simple Margherita pizza with olives added ($12.50). The dough is always my favorite consistency -- thin and soft and with crispy edges. The fresh basil is amazing -- I love it!

Plan on having a crepe -- they're definitely a must-have if you go to Cibo. I love getting the Nutella and banana one and adding mascarpone and whipped cream to it, too ($10.50). Every bite is incredible, and it will have you coming back for more.

The atmosphere combined with the mouthwatering food solidifies Cibo as one of my go-to restaurants. It's truly a Valley gem, and I hope it stays open forever!",10,3,5

Pear salad - an arugula salad with balsamic, pears, honey, cheese, and toasted almonds - Very good, would definitely recommend! 

Burrata - creamy mozzarella with a balsamic glaze served with prosciutto and toast  - so good but not enough toast in the cheese-to-bread ratio! 

Vegetariana pizza - a pizza with mozzarella, artichokes, zucchini, roasted red peppers - comes with mushrooms but we asked for it without. This was good but the veggies are separated by section - so you only get one type of veggie on a slice of pizza, rather than having it mixed. 

Prosciutto Crudo pizza - sauce, mozzarella, topped with prosciutto. Very tasty but the pizza is cut before the prosciutto is added to the pizza, so you have to recut it to avoid ending up with all the prosciutto on one piece. 

Pizza is good - very thin crust and all the ingredients seem very fresh.

Cibo has excellent pizza in a charming atmosphere - it's a great date restaurant, Girls-Night-Out restaurant, or ""Place to take your hip Mom"" restaurant.  Not a ton of testosterone here.  Which is fine, we're secure enough to come here and sit on the spindly little patio chairs and sip wine and munch on pizza and idly agree with the dining companion du jour about how cute everything is.  

I lied in the previous sentence.  I never munch on pizza.  Perhaps I shouldn't be hungry as I write this, but I tend to devour my pizza in such a way that embarrasses anyone with a good view.  I imagine it must be like a train wreck.  

The service here has some issues.  They always take care of me, per se, and they do it with a degree of aplomb, but I have gotten some attitude here previously.  Maybe they have elephantine memories and remember that time I brought my plastic cup of iced mocha from Fair Trade and refused to let them take it until halfway through my meal (I wasn't done with it!!!!) or the one time my friend asked if she could get a side of Ranch Dressing (not kidding, seriously you should know by now I honestly couldn't make this stuff up [to which request the waiter replied with a terse ""Umm, no.""])  

I have yet to find the perfect pizza ingredients here - Diavolo is too spicy, other things I've tried are too sweet, not enough flavor, or have other drawbacks (vegetables, for instance) which prevent them from being favorites.

Although the ultra-trendy bungalow setup has now become somewhat of a hipster cliché in downtown Phoenix, I'm pretty sure Cibo was there long before the downtown scene started picking up. Locals seem to flock here for their pizza and wine fixes. Based on the conversations I've overheard while eating, it's clear that Cibo not only serves as an ideal first-date place, but a somewhat secretive hideaway for middle-aged couples having mid-life marital affairs (I've witnessed both first-hand at nearby tables).

Cibo offers up a fairly decent pizza. One thing I do like, is that they'll gladly let you do half-and-half pies. Most of these Neapolitan places arrogantly scoff at the mere mention of the idea. In fact, they even let you combine a white pizza with a red one, which is very rare, but incredibly convenient given all of their different choices.

While I give Cibo credit for offering some interesting creations, is it really necessary to have 22 different pizzas (sans the calzones) on the menu? Oddly enough, despite all of these ridiculous options that give me anxiety at first glance, their best pizza is a traditional margherita. Their calzone, which is rather alarming at first, due to its massive size, is also good. Although I hate admitting that I am partial to the ones served elsewhere.

Their burrata appetizer was all right, but not something I'd probably order again. We've also tried their linguine pasta, which I liked, but for all the wrong reasons. It reminded me of Kraft mac and cheese (one of my guilty pleasures), which I'm pretty sure was not their intention.  

The banana and nutella crepe with a scoop of ice cream has never disappointed and is one of the few things that I feel they've got down to a science.  

Their canned sodas seems like kind of an odd choice, especially considering most pizzerias opt for the glass bottle selection. It seems rather ghetto in comparison to everything else on the menu. Not everyone drinks wine, you know?  

I feel that it's worth an occasional visit, but will probably never be at the top of my list of places to regularly frequent. I guess that just makes me tragically unhip, but I'd much rather enjoy the limited, but yet exceptional pie options from Bianco or Il Bosco,

One of the first things about Cibo that draws you in is the expansive patio with benches, fire pit, and tables for service. I imagine that the fire pit and benches come in handy on a busy Friday night while you swill some wine waiting for your table. My man-date and i had stopped by the vintage craftsman home that is Cibo for a Friday lunch anticipating pizza-y goodness... nope, sandwiches and salads only for lunch.  Alright, we are big boys, no crying, suck it up, roll with the punches.  Sadly to say after perusing the sandwiches and salads i wasn't overly excited about anything, it was all a pretty much boring standards.  That isn't to say it didn't sound edible but i honestly expected a little more than the standard Prosciutto and Motz sandwiches of any Italian deli. I settle the PLT but with added Motz (BLT but Prosciutto instead of bacon) and my buddy got the Pastrami. If nothing else Cibo has amazing bread, everything else was a little boring.  The bell pepper aioli vaguely smelled like anchovies which freaked me out but i decided to eat it anyways, i am still feeling okay hours later as i write this, don't worry. The salad that came with was tasty but i could have done with less pine nuts\/garnish and more attention to the sandwiches.  Nothing was terrible but i don't think i would ever rush back to eat lunch, i think i am going to try and do dinner later this week before i head back to CA but it might get passed over for Spinatos or Bianco.

During one visit, I went for dinner and had the most delicious pizza! The charm of this place makes you feel like you are distant from reality. The dessert wine I ordered at the end was the icing on the cake! 

However, on my next visit, I sat outside on the patio for brunch and it was not quite as great of an experience. The weather was great, but the sun was shining pretty bright so I am guessing that is why our server only came by to get our order, drop it off, and bring our tab. No refills, no feedback requested on the meal, nothing. She was a very sweet lady, she just didn't seem to want to serve our table. The food was just ok. Nothing exciting. And probably more disappointing since I had already been there once and had such an awesome experience.

I've been to Cibo 3 times in the past few months and wouldn't have it any other way.

The service has always been spectacular.  There's a good selection of beer and wine, and an almost impossible-to-choose-from selection of pizzas.  We're not talking New York thin-slice sauce-and-cheese, we're talking locally sourced ingredients and artful combination.  Perfect crust topped with the perfect combination of delicious meats, cheeses, and veggies galore.

Your least favorite part of the meal will definitely be trying to pronounce the names of the pizzas.

went at 6pm on a friday night and the wait wasn't bad - maybe 15-20 minutes. it wasn't too crowded in there so we managed to huddle around the bar and have a drink and chat for a bit before we were seating. i had almost forgotten how absolutely charming this place was - you feel very at home inside, and it makes for a comfortable meal and dining experience.

although the service wasn't as good as i expected it to be - our waiter disappeared for long periods of time and didn't check on us very often - it wasn't bad enough to the point of knocking the place down a star. 

first up came the bread and olive oil, and when we asked for butter, we were denied because they didn't have any. what restaurant doesn't have butter? we ordered two salads to share - the house salad and the pear salad. both were superb. the large chunks of parmigiano  on the house salad were tasty as was the balsamic dressing - not too much and not too little - just right. we went with two pizzas, a red and a white. the capriciossa and the other one i forgot the name (it had fontina cheese and pepperoni, and it's not on the online menu). the white pizza was definitely  my favorite, as i am not a fan of pizza with a lot of toppings. i just can't get over how delicious these pizzas are - the crispy wood-fired crust and the cheesiest of cheeses - cooked to perfect. we couldn't leave without desert, and settled on the nutella and fresca. both were to die for; i prefered the fruitiness of the fresca to the somewhat overly sweet nutella.

The only gripe would be that after a bottle of wine and splitting a pizza, we were asked twice if we wanted another pizza. Really? 2 pizzas in one night for 2 people? Granted they are not that big, but it's 4 pieces each. 

I didn't comment on the absurdity of the suggested portions, but as we got the check the girl said something like, ""guess we're eating light tonight"". I really felt like saying- ""no, we're not stuffing our faces tonight and instead eating appropriate portions. Though obesity is an epidemic there is an easy preventative measure that can be taken.""

The appetizer was not that impressive to be honest. It was steaks of calamari about 2 fingers width fried up. The batter itself was good but I think if you're an Italian place you should have calamari that's rings and tentacles. 

Their pizza here is incredible. It's about a 12 inch serving good for and appetizer or splitting along with another entree. The pizza is thin crust that's dough while also maintaining a thin and crispy feeling. Pretty much perfect brick oven pizza. 

Their pastas are extremely well done and the server said their pasta is all made in house which you can truly taste.

The Magueritta was oily, with few basil on top. The sauce tasted as if it were from a can. The Salsiccia was a different story, it was saucy, tangy from the tomatoes and a bit of smokiness from the sausage and the crust. Overall our favorite.

This Italian restaurant is that but much more. On the corner of North 5th Avenue and West Filmore. At night, you will see a house lit up with strings of white lights and the sound of a guitar playing sweet melodies. 
Getting there was a small challenge for me. Not being from Phoenix and not being familiar with side streets. My main route was using the freeway. Which I am not a particular fan of. 
This night, Friday, was filled with a lot of ambulances, cop cars and fire trucks with lights and sirens blazing. One incident, my wife counted around 12 of these emergency vehicles going the other way on the freeway at the same time. I just pray that they all got there on time to help the people who were in need.
Getting closer to the restaurant. You can see the tall buildings of downtown. We were following the maps app but a lot of the streets are not well lit. So we missed a street or two. Luckily we did find the restaurant. Again the strings of white lights and the guitar music were a good indicator that we were here. Plenty of parking on West Filmore street.
Besides the front patio dining. They have a small bar once your inside. The bar itself holds, at most, 9 individuals. A good selection of bottled beers, wine and shots of different cocktails. My wife tried a limoncello drink that she thought was real good. Too bad she got the last one so she couldn't order another.
What makes this restaurant cozy but large is the inside of the restaurant is broken up into smaller rooms. So you never see everyone who is dining there. You can just focus on your present company and the meal you are sharing. This also explains the being romantic and busy part. Waiting for your table you see servers and patrons going back and forth. It's not until you get seated into one of those smaller rooms that everything starts to slow down.
The crowd that eats there is a very diverse crowd. From hipster guys and gals to men in suit and ties and women in dresses. Young and old come here.
And they come for the atmosphere but mainly for the food. Great Italian fare. Pizzas, pasta dishes, colorful salads. The food is amazing. House chop salad is great, 3 pairs of different prepared bruschetta is great and the bolognese sausage dish that I had was so good. It was all delicious. If you come here.

Most recently wife and I went with our 13 month old son after work on Friday.  Not only are they a nice date place to go before a night out, but they also can accommodate our toddler with finger foods and friendly service.  

Baby B loved his meatballs and chewy pizza crust, while momma had the Di Notti, and I had the Rustica because it has arugula on top which makes me feel I'm eating healthy.  The sparrows got a healthy dose of pizza crust too because B is a bit of a messy eater. 

We always do the patio, and love sitting outside in this nice old Phoenix neighborhood.  Let the tourists go to Bianco; locals know Cibo is better, and you don't have to wait four hours for a table.",2,1,1

Excellent food (pizza), good prices, great vibe and scene.  I have been here several times, but we last visited Cibo the other day so it refreshed my memory.  Plus, I realized that I never reviewed it before!

Anyways, we came on a Tuesday afternoon during happy hour.  It was such a nice spring Phoenix afternoon that we sat outside in their patio.  Actually, this is all we have ever sat at on our prior visits.  It's because I absolutely love their patio.  It really feels like I'm eating in a outdoor garden.  Such a cool and great feel, one of the main reasons why we keep coming back.  The inside is also very nice, Cibo is a converted home into a restaurant, but we just prefer to sit on the patio.

For the happy hour menu they have several appetizers from $4-$6 dollars, plus $4 house wines and $2.5 Peronis.  We ordered the Polpette (meatballs with bread).  It was great, Cibo's sauce was amazing and a great compliment to the meatballs.  

We also ordered from the pizza menu, the Diavola with added ricotta cheese.  It was a tomato based sauce pizza with spicy salame.  Our server recommend that  we add ricotta cheese.  I'm glad that we did, this was a great pizza.  it was perfectly cooked.  Crust was flakey, yet soft.  The ricotta added a nice creamy texture.  We really enjoyed our pizza, and with the appetizer it was a good amount of food for my wife and i to split.

We ended up passing on dessert, but have had their crepes before and they were excellent.

I really can't say much more about Cibo.  Again it is one of our go to places to eat while we are in downtown Phoenix.  This is a perfect place to enjoy a nice romantic meal at decent prices.  Can't really beat the value here, nor the food.   We look forward to coming back sometime soon!",2,2,1

Phoenix weather is starting to get manageable so it's very nice to eat outside. We came after dusk so the lights were very pretty. We were seated in the more exposed outside area... There's another side right nearby that's more enclosed and looks much cozier. 

We had a 1\/2 Tartufata and Capricciosa. I wanted something familiar and tasty and that was hard to find. I chose tartufata because I like mushrooms and the prosciutto. 

Um, the pizzas were barely ok. They weren't terrible, but nothing like the reviews suggested. It's thin crust, but was floppy. The only thing telling me the two diff pizzas apart was that one had olives. I THINK there was mushrooms but I didn't taste it. The pizzas, sauce and toppings, were one homogenous thing. I HATE that when it comes to pizza. It didn't come out cheese-bubbly and charred. 

It's an expensive small pizza. It should taste better than Dominoes. I'm hoping it's a bad day because it tastes like soggy leftover pizza. No cheese stringing away after you bite it or anything. It was an even layer of firm sauce  and toppings. 

The dessert was good. We had the fresca. The sliced peaches tasted it came from a can but the rest of the fruit was fresh and the ice cream and whipped cream was good. 

One last note. It seems the server dresses in whatever they want and there are a lot of them so it's just a flurry of people walking around, all wearing regular clothing. Sometimes we didn't know if they worked there to flag them down. I went to Clever Koi recently and the staff there was so friendly and really knew their menu. The servers here were curt and disinterested. However the people cleaning up our plates after each course were prompt.

Some may say cliché; I say it's down right charming! 
Our party was seated pretty quickly (especially considering there were seven of us that showed up around 7:30 on a busy Friday night). Our waitress was awesome; answering our questions and giving us plenty of time to peruse the wine list and menu. Since pretty much everything looked tasty, we decided to order a variety and share. Most of us ended up splitting the Capricciosa, Salsicca, Pomodoro Fresco, and Salame pizzas, while one of our group opted for the Antipasto Speciale (because who can resist a dish that boasts a ""fantasy of olives""). All were yummy, but the spicy salame had to be my favorite - they aren't kidding when they say ""spicy"". The Capricciosa was a close second, but, alas, had too many toppings to eat without a fork. The four pizzas, along with a generous quantity of vino, were plenty for six to share as a main dish, leaving just enough room for dessert. The Nutella crepe can't be beat, especially when embellished with a scoop of ice cream and the obligatory birthday candle (happy birthday Lisa!).",1,0,0

After posting my last update, I received a bit of a nasty email from someone affiliated with the restaurant, scolding me for not notifying them of the burnt pizza and saying they *probably* would have given a free dessert if I had (""probably""?! Wth?). So, whoever you are who wrote to me - first of all, it's not my job to do YOUR job. There were enough people involved in the making of my burnt pizza that it should have been noticed before making it to me. Second off, the waiter initially forgot to put the pizza order in, so he had to come back and ask me what I had ordered. So I wasn't too keen on complaining considering it was difficult to get the d*mn pizza to begin with. Thirdly, my toddler was eating it and I certainly would not have ever considered taking it away from her. Anyone who has ever eaten with toddlers would know this. Which leads me to my last point. Eating with a toddler at a restaurant is not easy to do. The last thing I would ever do is make the experience longer than I needed it to be. WTF. 

So, thanks for your nasty email. And here's some advice to you: the next time you receive a less than stellar review from someone whose hard-earned money pays your salary, respond like this: ""Dear customer, we are so sorry your experience was below our standards. Please see the manager the next time you visit so we can take care of you.""

My boyfriend and I happened to be in the area, and turned to our trusty pal Yelp for some assistance. With four and a half stars and over 500 reviews, this place definitely caught our attention. 

Located just minutes away from Downtown Phoenix, we were almost deterred away when we found Cibo located next to residential properties. But when we walked in, we were definitely down. It looks like a little tucked away cottage, something you wouldn't find next to the city. 

The place is literally built in a refurbished little home. We walked in and were seated immediately. The menu was a tad difficult to understand, but wasn't that much of a deterrent, as we used yelp photos as our guide. 

My only complaint is that they don't serve pizza until 5 p.m., but that wasn't really a big deal, as we made choices on the menu regardless. 

I got the cous cous salad and the boyfriend got the meatball sandwich with chips. 
Cous Cous salad came with fresh spring mix lettuce, diced grape tomatoes, pine nuts, cous cous, onions, and some other ingredients, and was dressed in a light lemon dressing. The dressing really was refreshing and light, but the salad itself was super filling and extremely flavorful! I would recommend it! 

The meatball sandwich was really delicious as well. The meatballs seemed authentic and fresh, and it came with melted cheese and warm marinara sauce in between the crispy, yummy bread. 

The bread that they served on the side of the entrees wasn't bad at all-- but it was served cold, which wasn't very appetizing, so I only ate one piece. 

Service is friendly and helpful, and unique. I like places that allow their employees to dress how they wish. It adds a homey flare to the restaurant. 

We definitely need to return for dinner on their cozy little patio! When I'm in the Downtown area again, I'll make sure to stop by at Cibo",1,1,0

We had the Saltimbocca Freddi and Fritatta Melfitana for the main course. Very fresh ingrediants prepared to perfection.  Plus #2

The BIG Plus #3 was the dessert.  Dessert for breakfast...YES!!  We decided to try both sweet crepes and share. This is a great option because both were so good that I couldn't have picked just one.  Nuttella and Mascarpone was warm. The waitress mentioned topping it with ice cream which was a perfect recommendation.  Frutti di Bosco was topped with mixed berries that were so perfect that you wanted to pick them off the crepe with your hands and just pop them in your mouth.

One of the friends has Celiac's Disease and therefore must eat a gluton-free diet, which I inquired about the previous night I was there.  I called ahead to confirm their gluton-free menu and a very snotty girl informed me they ""could make anything on their menu gluton-free"" and they ""did not take reservations.""  We arrived at 7PM and were told of a 30 min. wait; 1 hr. later we were seated.  Another 10 mins. and a waitress asked about drinks and we ordered a bottle of wine and menus.  Another 15 mins. later our wine was brought and immediately opened, and when we asked about the gluton-free menu again, the waitress told us ""Oh, unfortunately we're all out of our gluton-free dough.  In fact two people before you just asked and couldn't get any.""  She stared at us expecting to order something else, to which my friend said ""it's not like it's a diet I'm on, it's a lifestyle.  I can't eat anything then.""  So after all that we walked out, drove to La Grande Orange on 40th St. & Camelback (known for it's fantastic gluton-free pizzas) and had a wonderful time.

Cibo, however, does indeed take the lead by a very significant stretch over Bianco.  

First and very much FOREMOST, the owners are absolute treasures.  They have never been anything less than engaging, charming, and overtly polite.  Whether my gf and I eat there or take out, they always greets us as friends and seem to be genuinely appreciative of our business.  On one visit when i was with a large party of about 10-12 people we kinda had to squeeze into a small area in the front room, which was still quaint and comfortable, but i made an offhand joke after the owner looked concerned about my smallish seat, that she could ""make it up to me with a beer"".  I was completely embarrassed as she REALLY DID bring me a Celebration Ale on the house.  She's just an awesome lady.

Their building itself is enamoring with a large patio for the pleasant autumn nights of Phoenix and their interior is very cozy for a more subtle dinner.  The restaurant can be both romantic or merry.  

Their tiny bar is perfect for a short wait (never waited longer than 5-10 mins at most), especially during take out where we like to enjoy their Sangiovese Chianti blend. 

Their pizza itself is delicious.  The Rustica is my go-to and they tend to use generous amounts of meat and cheese (the prosciutto being my favorite).  Their portions are perfect for two people and are well-informed on how many pizzas will be 'just enough' for your party.  Also, their marscapone\/Nutella crepes are insanely good.

If you ever have a chance to host an event, see if they will let you use their carriage house in the back, where, come to find out after we used it for our own holiday party, had a ""recent tenant"".  Lucky dude to have Cibo as a neighbor.  

The back carriage house has a wine bar and a private server as well as a small patio for outside drinking\/smoking.  Cibo is a perfect little neighborhood pizzeria.",3,2,5

I called ahead to see if we could make a reservation for our party of 3 as we had show tickets and was informed that they do not take reservations for parties smaller than 8. I was assured however that we should have NO PROBLEM being seated promptly at 6PM on a Saturday evening. Our show was at 8PM so I figured a 2 hour window should have been ample. It's just pizza--how hard can it be? Boy was I wrong.

Well guess what? The restaurant was P.A.C.K.E.D. We waited 20 minutes to be seated which wasn't too bad for a Saturday evening at a popular spot but when the expectation was already set that it ""wouldn't be a problem"" to get seated, it was annoying.  The hostesses were friendly and pleasant tho so it was hard to be outwardly annoyed. 

We were finally seated inside and proceeded to wait some more for a server to come by and take our drink order. 10 minutes passed when I flagged down a busser to ask if we could get someone to take our drink order. A few short minutes later, our server arrived and so it began...the glare. The ""can't you see I'm very busy and you'll just have to wait"" glare. Sigh. Because we were seated in a smaller room, it was very noisy and our server REFUSED to speak louder to share with us the beers they had available. We aren't deaf...it was just loud. She wouldn't move closer to the person asking, she wouldn't speak louder, nothing. And then she walked away...and 10 minutes later, she passed by to inform us that the bartender was backed up and it would be a few more minutes but didn't stop long enough to take our appetizer or dinner order. Fortunately, the busser was VERY on top of keeping our water filled so at least we had SOMETHING to drink. Drinks finally came out and we had to ask her to take our appetizer order. Again the ""can't you see I'm busy"" glare. It was 30 minutes after seating that our appetizer finally came. We ordered the Burrata which is fresh mozzarella with proscuitto and toast. Although the mozzarella and proscuitto were delicious, the toast was burnt...visibly burnt. I'm not even sure why she put it in front of us that's how burnt it was. But, we couldn't send it back because no one ever came by to check on us. 

More time passes and everyone in the room has received their appetizers, entrees, and have moved on to dessert except for us. We are still waiting for our entrees and are watching the clock. At 7:20, I flagged down our server who gave me the glare again to ask her if our pizzas were coming out soon as we had show tickets. Instead of ""I'm so sorry for the wait, let me check on that for you"" I received the ""I'd call you a bitch if I wouldn't get fired for it"" glare and this time the glare was accompanied by a lecture that there was a party in the Carriage House. I had NO idea what the Carriage House was or why a party there had any effect on our meals but our server had already huffed off before I could ask. So we googled. Turns out Carriage House is part of Cibo where they serve large parties. Good to know...would have been better to know back when we were getting seated about these delays but so be it. Our pizzas arrived at the table at 7:30 PM. We have now been at Cibo for 90 minutes. Our show was at Comerica and was starting at 8PM. We scarfed down that pizza as fast as we could and Ms. Glare left us the check at least when she dropped our pizzas. 

After all that waiting, rudeness, and more waiting, honestly? I've had better pizza at Picazzos. This pizza was thin looking but was doughy. The sausage on the Salsiccia was sparse at best. The Rustica wasn't cut properly so we were fighting with the proscuttio. Both were just ok. It was really very anti-climatic. 

Cibo was a major disappointment. Considering all the rave reviews here on Yelp, I am that much more disappointed that our experience was so dismal. I wish I could tell you our server's name. If she said it, we sure didn't hear her and I'm pretty sure she didn't say it. There are lots of other options downtown. You might consider not going to Cibo unless you go with a larger party because apparently that's the only way to get good service and properly prepared food.",6,2,1

We wanted to eat outside today given the weather but no shade tables were available. No worries -- we had a wonderful meal inside. We are a party of 4 that loves pizza and hungry. We had the DiNotte, Salsiccia and the Genova pizzas. They all were excellent-- fresh crust not too thick and the dough had been allowed to rise properly. Toppings were all fresh and there are multiple non tomatoe sauce options which is to my liking. The Gorgonzola on the DiNotte pizza gave it a unique distinctive flavor(good). We also had 2 salads -- the house salad was very fresh. In my opinion the biggest distinction was the freshly grated Parmesan flakes. My wife had the only other salad offered prior to 3 on Sat which had strawberries, goat cheese, and candies walnuts over spinach. My wife added grilled chicken and enjoyed it all.

We had driven by about a year before while we were kind of lost downtown, and said ""that place is really busy, we'll have to try it some time."" I am SO happy that we did tonight. We were seated promptly outside tucked in the corner. It's December, so you would think we would be chilly, we kept our jackets on during dinner but there are plenty of heaters surrounding the outside tables, so we were kept warm. The ambiance is beautiful, the outside tables are lit how you wish every restaurant you visit would be.   

I had the green tea, real tea, nothing that they bring you in a bag, but they actually pour the hot water over the real tea leaves, it was very good. My husband said the coffee was rather good as well. 

As an appetizer we split the pear salad: Spinach, vinaigrette, almonds, cheese, pears and honey. I'm not horribly adventurous when it comes to mealtime so I was nervous, but it was so good. 

I'd say 1 pizza can heartily feed 2 people, but we opted for separate ones to try anyway. I had the Salsiccia (sausage, mozzarella, and red sauce), while my husband opted for the Salsiccia con Patate (sausage, roasted potatoes). The crust is soft and chewy, not overdone like so many places. His was a bit drier than mine, no sauce, but both were still good and we walked away with a whole pizza left over between the two of us, yummy yummy left overs! 

The Dessert: All we could say was ""Oh My!"" We had the Fresca Crepe. A delicious crepe filled with vanilla ice cream and fruit, topped with whipped cream and more fruit. Fresh peaches, kiwi, and strawberries. We had the Nutella on the side but it was quite good drizzled on top. I'd go back for the dessert alone!

Our server, James, was very polite and there was one girl going around always asking people if they needed more water. I never felt neglected by the waitstaff and it is Friday night after all.

We were seated behind some obnoxiously loud lady who was over-explaining to her friend how poorly her coworker taught K-12 chemistry...and was getting almost everything wrong herself (I have a PhD in molecular genetics, so the convo was like listening to nails scraping a chalkboard). That's neither here nor there. Our bad experience was enhanced by this.

So barely being able to hear myself think, I try to order a drink. The cocktail selection stinks for a place that appears to have an open bar. Plus, the waitress wasn't very helpful at all. She offered the peach bellini and then quickly retracted when she noted that they were out of the peach ingredient. Really?

Then trying my best to speak over Loud-Talker explaining that all you needed to demonstrate ""splitting atoms"" is two styrofoam balls and a toothpick...nuclear fission with toothpicks...I asked the waitress if they had anything akin to an Italian soda, or maybe a soda\/ seltzer with a splash of vodka and some flavor. What I figured was a simple request was impossible at Cibo.

We left as Loud-Talker proclaimed that grade school kids don't need to learn chemistry, just general science...and we wonder why AZ's 8th graders rank #45 in the nation in STEM topics.

All in all, our waitress was aloof from the moment we sat down. She was either spaced out or just had no people skills. Having the atmosphere ruined by Ms. Loud-Talker was our own bad luck, but I still give this place one star for the poor service.

Yelped nearby restaurants and this one caught my eye. I love wood oven pizzas and dessert crepes and having both in one place was a dream come true. Went with my neice, who lives nearby and had never been here. The restaurant is in a great space though the location is a bit odd. This combination, for me, adds to it's appeal. The place was packed but we had a very short wait. By the time we left, there was quite a crowd gathered outside.

We started with caprese salad with homemade mozzarella. The texture of the cheese was spectacular and the tomatoes were good but not great. Perhaps that's because I'm from California, home of the sweetest tomatoes around. We decided to order two pizzas, one with red sauce and one with white because it all sounded and looked so good. We ordered the capprioso and the white pizza with pear (can't remember the actual name) The crust was the key. I'm giving Cibo 4 stars because the actual flavors of the toppings and sauce on the pizza are not as flavorful as I expected and not as bold as I like. Everything was very mellow. But man, the crust rocked my world. I might try some other toppings that have a stronger taste to see if they are better but what we picked was on the border of bland. The true highlight of the mean was the dessert crepe we ordered. We ordered two pizzas and one crepe but we should have ordered one pizza and two crepes. True, we got nutella in the crepe which is a gimme in terms of tastiness but we added strawberries and whipped cream which took it over the top. The crepe itself was light, airy and just melt in your mouth good. 

I thought about giving Cibo 4 stars but I just couldn't do it. I wanted to love everything about this place but I just didn't. When the best flavor I had was nutella, you know there's a slight the problem. I honeslty wasn't impressed with the toppings and the flavor and the quality of the pizza sauce but the crust won me over. I would definitely come back for both the atmosphere and the food and perhaps a different pizza would be better. The servers ran around and seemed to work hard though the food came out slower than I expected and the wait staff, while flying around and by often, wasn't actually attentive. If ever in Phoneix again, I look forward to trying more things on this menu but until then, I can only say it's good but not great and certainly did not blow my socks off.",1,0,0

Basically, they ran out of some of their specials, didn't tell us in a timely manner, and then annoyed us further with some schtick about their chef not liking substitutions for an alternative entree we ordered. 

In response to my review, the owner wrote me a personal message acknowledging what happened and offering a heart-felt apology. She also graciously offered to comp my meal, which I told her she didn't have to do. I have to say, with that kind of attitude by a business owner, no one can argue that she doesn't care about the place or its customers. And so, I can only conclude that I've been struck by lightning (""random crap going on with a manager or servers on a busy night"" lightning) 3 consecutive times. So, I will shift my review back up to 3 stars for now (2.5 from my original review, plus a half star for sending me such a nice email), and reserve judgment for my next visit.

This past time I was in, I sat inside, but still thoroughly enjoyed my surrounding environment! Our server was very friendly, patient, and helped make my friend's birthday so awesome. At the end of our meal, she brought us a Nutella crepe with a candle on top! The crepe was so delicious that we decided to try one more dessert... Because what the heck! We got the Frutti Di Bosco crepe with mascarpone filling. The flavor was simply intriguing and all I have to say is YOU HAVE TO TRY IT. 

Thank you Cibo for a memorable evening. Everything was amazing, and I will continue to come here for years to come!",1,0,1

If you like real Italian\/Naples style pizza, this is your place. While they also do a specialty pasta dish a couple days during the week, pizza is really the heart and soul of the place.

I like to dine here when the weather is nice and we can eat outside. On Friday and Saturday nights, they have a live jazz band outside. This can be a very romantic place to go and I highly recommend it for a date. 

All the deserts (except one) are using Nutella as an ingredient. I am not a fan of Nutella, but I must say the Pellani 2.0 is most excellent and only about $6. What is it? Imagine donut holes being served in a little metal basket with four wooden spears. You spear the donut hole with the little stick, then dip it in the ramekin of Nutella to your taste and enjoy! or, feed each other - very romantic.

The prices for what you get are very reasonable. Parking can be a challenge or you can use their complimentary valet.

Lot's of stuff to do downtown very close to this place (Film Bar, Angel's Trumpet, Crescent Ballroom, Breadfruit bar...too many things to do in this area that I can list here).

Highly recommended, but very limited menu. If you like REAL pizza, in a unique and romantic atmosphere and very affordable. I only wish I knew about this place sooner.",0,0,0

It's my go to for celebrations, a place to take visiting guest, date night, night with the girls, all occasions! Prepare to indulge and do not count count calories.  You're eating quality ingredients with remarkable flavors.  The Barrata is superb! Smooth creamy Barrata with aged sweet balsamic vinegar and thin cuts of prosciutto on toasted bread is a must! Pizzas, oh the pizzas...are made in a wood fired oven and offer the perfect toasted yet chewy crusts. I highly recommend the Diavola if you like spice.  You can always add a touch of coolness by adding ricotta cheese. Secondly I recommend their Salsiccia con Potate. Baked chunks of seasoned potatoes with sausage and mozzarella. 

All desserts are wonderful, great coffees and homemade creamy lemoncello.  

Notes: Sunday brunch is offered with a slightly different menu. They also serve chorizo that is remarkable! They serve a pizza much like the Salsiccia con potate with pesto & onions.  Sounds strange but it's delicious! 

Homemade pastas served only 2 nights a week. Check their website. Currently it's Wed & Thurs. 

Only beer & wine; except at brunch where they offer Bloody Mary's.

With a range of vegetarian options that taste just fine, CIBO is a go-to spot in downtown Phoenix if you're looking to get out of the hotel but not venture too far into the desert.

CIBO feels like one big home. Well, that might be because the restaurant exterior looks like a home. My server was a bit quirky: he had jokes, but also had a knack for stopping by our table at the most inopportune times. He reminded me of the mom calling about the squirrels in the GEICO commercial. 

The food at CIBO is affordable: I paid $14 for a plate of pasta (linguine cacao e pepe) and $11 for a margherita pizza. I wouldn't recommend the pasta - it was as plain as a white t-shirt. The microgreens on top were a nice touch, but out of place. The pizza was tasty, but I avoided eating the crust.

I wish it hadn't taken me so long to get back to Cibo (life tends to get in the way!!) and believe me, it won't be long before my next visit.

We returned for lunch today and were seated right away. The place wasn't near as busy as the last visit because many had Columbus Day off work. Our server welcomed us promptly and took our drink orders. We decided on hot sandwiches: Sicilian sausage and pulled pork. OMG - they were soooo delicious!!! The pork was lean, tender and in a wonderful spicy (but not overly) sauce. The Fontina cheese was a great touch and tasteful. The bread...ummmmm good. I'm tired of getting sandwiches on so much bread that you can't open your mouth wide enough to bite - the grilled saltimbocca bread was so good! The sausage sandwich was super flavorful with the perfect amount of peppers and onions. Again, the bread complimented the sandwich.

The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it took a while to get our bill. While we weren't in a hurry, the server walked by our table a couple of times and didn't check in on us. As I mentioned the place wasn't overly busy at all so I would have expected a tad more attentiveness.

Apparently this is norm because there were other cars double parked. RIDICULOUSNESS! I won't write Cibo off today just because a staff had a bad night or because I didn't know that double parking was expected in the lot.

Inside small two or four seat tables nestled into every nook and cranny of the adorable former house provide the same feeling as the outside but with a few dashes of warmth and cozy.

Now comes the food.  I feel in love with prosciutto at Cibo.  I rediscovered why I loved pepperoni here.  I remember each time I come just how perfect pizza can be.  I have had about 7 different pizzas here.  The one with arugula on top is delicious.  The one with just cheese (4 delectable kinds) and spicy salami is delicious.  The one with walnuts is delicious.

I was soooo excited that I finally made it here seeing that I have had a few friends continuously recommending this place. This could be a great date day\/night place or a place you meet up with a group of friends. They offer both in and outdoor seating. I highly recommend outdoor seating:) Beautiful weather during the day and beautiful weather at night plus romantically lit up with small lights around the patio. We were seated on the patio right away around 1pm on Saturday afternoon. We had a party of 10 and had more than enough space.  There was a young boy singing and playing music on the patio, which made the overall ambiance and atmosphere even better especially on any day in Arizona:) The waitress filled our glasses with water and lemon right away. I thought it was a bit strange that the water came with a lemon already in the water because typically they don't and I also happen to be someone who does not like knowing that someone probably used there bare hands to put it there. We waited about 10 minutes until the rest of our party arrived and began ordering our food. 

About 10min after we order, the majority of us ran out of water and additional drinks people had ordered. So we waited, waited, and waited some more until finally we were able to waive down a different waiter to refill our drinks. Our food began to arrive about 30min after it was ordered. I ordered the Rustica Pizza, which was highly recommended to me by multiple friends and boy was I pleased! The crust was by far the best part! It was semi thin with a crisp bottom crust. The prosciutto was very tender and melts in your mouth and the cheese was just he right amount. This pizza was AWESOME! I also tried some of the entrees around the table including the side salad, which was huge with a variety of organic veggies, fresh parm cheese and balsamic vinaigrette to top, the Caprese sandwich, and the Margherita Pizza, which were all great! 

Half way through our meal we again waited without drinks for about 15min. We were at Cibo for a total of 2.5hrs and our waitress came by our table 4 times. With that being said we waited around for refills, waited about 30min for our table to be cleared of the finished plates and had to physically get up to get our waitress twice because we couldn't waive someone over to us. My gf had to wait a long time to open her gifts because it took the staff a ton of time to clear a table that should only take 2min to  clean. While we were waiting I decided to use their restroom. On my way there I noticed that the location of the restroom was hard to find and was shoved into a back corner where they also had shoved 8 sets of chairs. It order to get to the restroom I had to walk sideways about 10ft (and I'm tiny!) to the restroom to handle my business. The average size woman would not have been able to fit through such a small space, which to me raises a HUGE red flag. I went to wash my hands and to my surprise the paper towel dispenser was not working so I had to use me pants...lovely! When I got back to the table we finished unwrapping gifts and called it a day. Overall, I loved the food and ambiance and feel that the service we recieved was extremely poor considering that it was not busy at all and there was no excuse for it. I would not recommend this place to groups larger than 6 people and I would also advise anyone who goes here to be ready to test their patience when it comes to service:)",0,0,0

Amanda M is one of my favorite Austin Yelpers, who has since transplanted to London. A couple of weeks ago she sent me a totally random text: ""I accidentally deleted all my pictures of a wonderful restaurant Andi & I went to in Phoenix, and I just want you to sympathize with me."" Well okay then, I can do that. I feel your loss, been there, done that. Incidentally, Andi is Amanda's fiancé and a cool guy. 

So here's how Karma works: Two weeks later I find myself in Phoenix, I have to eat somewhere, and I start thinking just because I'm a cool & sensitive guy, wouldn't it be fitting if I went to that restaurant and made a surprise photo montage for Amanda? Of course it would. That's what makes me a cool & sensitive guy. 

But what caught me by surprise is Cibo really is a remarkable place. It appears to be a converted house, and the outside patio\/garden\/dining area strewn with tiny lights is truly a wonderful place to be. On any given evening, it's easy to see why Cibo is a popular Phoenix destination. 

And it's also the best pizza I've ever had in a restaurant. I got a half Vegetariana and half Diavola, because Amanda said their spicy salami was really, really good. And she's correct. Perfect crust, perfect toppings. I'm pretty sure their cheese isn't coming from a can. The house salad and Nutella & strawberry crepe were just bonuses, and superb ones at that.

I wish I could be a little more specific on what made Cibo - and everything about the place - a wonderful and memorable experience for me. The quality of ingredients? The magical ambiance? The precise yet transparent service? Maybe it's as simple as completing my mission - I knew what Amanda's montage would look like before I even pieced the pictures together. And I posted it for you here. 

You know that classic storybook rhetoric about the planets lining up correctly, and then everything falls into place in perfect harmony? Well, that's pretty much how I felt walking into Cibo, and that's exactly how I felt walking out. I'm not sure it gets much better than that. In proper Yelpspeak, that makes Cibo as good as it gets.",16,14,19

The food was insane-very tasty!! The pizza combined typical Flavors of fresh sauce and cheese with pepperoni with less used ingredients of blue cheese and raw garlic. Crust had a perfect chewiness. Very good.

Cibo is located in a residential area so parking is limited around the neighborhood. As walked up to the restaurant I became very impressed with outside seating setup. Very intimate with a romantic feel. 

When I walked in to be seated I was greeted right away. This is always a plus for me. The setup inside is nice. There are dinning areas in each room of the house with awesome art work hanging from the walls.

Now for the main attraction! The PIZZA WAS THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD!!. He waitress was very kind and helpful. She made great recommendations and I was also impressed with the cheese ball appetizers.

Wood fired, thin crusted and a chewy crumb all combine to produce a pizza that will rival any of the famous New York eateries, including Rays. Their pies in a word are simply delectable.

Situated in a 1913 ranch house, your seating options are limited to:

* Small bedrooms, appointed similarly to a 1913 small bedroom; about a half dozen 
   tables with about 15-20 people to a room. If you want an intimate experience, these
   rooms aren't the place. Despite their talking softly, I still overheard the next table's
   plans for In Vitro, and since my wife was absent any form of communication, I 
   can proudly say I know just about all there is to know about In Vitro fertilization.
   Thanks bunches to you two for speckling my lunch with all your sperm speak.

* The bar area is also small but quaint and nicely appointed. I'm guessing you need 
   to time your arrival with the exact moment they unlock their doors if you have
   any designs on bar-flying it. 

* The patio area, where no misters abound, is certain to transform your date into 
   a sweaty Betty just moments after being seated. Perfect for old hippie chicks who 
   still sport patchouli as their primary cleansing function.

Cibo's parking is limited. Your choices are street parking or street parking. And remember, you're in downtown Phoenix...the same streets playing host to every ass-wart of societal humanity, so be sure to lock your car, set your alarm, and put your valuables in the trunk.

Food stuff:  I've been twice and both times I liked it, but it wasn't love.  We got the bruscetta plate and I wasn't really thrilled.  The traditional tomato one was the most solid choice, the bean one was strange and soggy and I don't eat pig so I can't comment on the third one (though everyone else seemed to enjoy it). The pizzas are pretty decent except that they lay out the toppings in a weird way, for example, if you order the vegetarian rosa pizza, if you like zucchini, it is all chopped up on two slices and so on.  It doesn't really make sense to top a pizza in such a way, to me.  I prefer draft beer over bottled beer, and all they offer is bottled.  I did enjoy a couple glasses of the Rossi Cabernet Sauvignon which was a solid wine choice.

Service:  The host\/ess was a pleasant person, and the time quoted was less than we actually had to wait so that rocked.  While waiting, we attempted to get a drink.  The bartender was cool about getting our drinks in a timely manner despite the fact that it was busy.  Our actual server was super attentive at first and then lost for a good chunk of time as well.

I have a couple server pet peeves and one those peeves popped up at Cibo;  throughout the dining experience (and no matter where you are, whether it be In-N-Out or Le Cirque, it should be a dining experience) the server takes no interest in your table other than to take your order and deliver - then suddenly out of no where, 5 minutes before he\/she is about to present the check, this new person emerges.

Probably.  

We decided to book a reservation at Cibo to celebrate a birthday since we couldn't get a reservation at Pizzeria Bianco and my parents are not fond of a wait.

The restaurant is cute and welcoming.  The neighborhood it is in is just a little sketchy, with a lot of vagabonds roaming around and a halfway house nearby.

We were not shy in ordering several appetizers and a few pizzas plus dessert for our party of six.  

Here's what we ordered and our impressions:

Appetizers: 
Il Tagliere (an assortment of Italian Meats and Cheeses) - 4*, this is absolutely the best thing on the menu for a group

Bresaola - 3*, the table seemed to devour this one

Caprese Salad - 3*, standard deal, the pesto was a nice touch

Entrees:
La Noce - 3*, the arugula did not seem that fresh, the crust was very plain and flavorless, the sauce was a little sweet

Prosciutto Crudo - 3*, my parents asked them to add some pecorino on top.  They liked this pizza, but it was a little bland to their liking

Siena - 3*, the table seemed to like this pizza the best, the spek was an interesting addition (though I don't eat pork) and DH liked it

Desserts:
Fresca crepe - 5*, this was absolutely delicious and we ordered a second one for the table!

The service was okay, but we were left many times wanting drink refills.

The salad was the pesto dressing house salad which had mixed greens, shaved parmesan cheese, nuts, and lord if I can't remember the rest. It was very good though. It was too bland for my husband but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The pizza was Di Napoli and the Crudo. The white pizza was super greasy and too heavy for me. The crudo was good but be warned that the salami was very spicy. I had a glass of rose which was okay. I tried to get the Cioccolotini but they were out so we split a Limoncello instead.

We went last night after seeing Kathy Griffin so we were both in dazzeling moods having laughed all night.. well leave to someone to suck the good out of your mood right quick.

We arrived at Cibo right at 10, they close at 11. The usual host and hostess sat next to the door chatting with some friends. The waiters were sitting at the large table in the front wrapping silverware and the bartender well he just ignored us completely. Finally one of the waiters asked if wanted a table.. no we would like to stand their and smell the pizza! Duh! So we asked him to hold one moment as we used the restroom real quick. Then when we came back he was gone and we were standing there once again being ignored. Finally the bartender made a huge sigh and asked of there were only 2 of us.. so he takes us to the left dining room and there are only 2 tables in there.. guess where he sat us.. right next to a couple that looked like they getting VERY romantic.. so they gave us crusty looks.. I then asked the bartender if we could just sit at the bar (I can appreciate someone wanting space, I didn't want to sit next to them either).. so he turns and looks to me, sighed again and said ""if you want"".. like those words were somehow causing his hair to fall out. So I said ""Oh wait, I wouldn't want to put you out!"".. he then just turned and stormed towards the bar.. the Mr stopped him and said never mind.. (he didn't want him waiting on us after that little episode) so we sat next to the couple.. they looked at us like we had just interrupted a marriage proposal and she hadn't quite answered yet.

So Im mad as all heck.. Ive been treated badly before but I gotta know you before you can walk all over me! Im SO over Cibo at this point and ready to leave but the Mr talked me into staying.. he has this special talent of calming the beast, not that I turn green and tear my clothes off or anything but my tongue has been known to be very sharp! 

Waiter arrives takes our drink order.. nice wine list though very small.. he returns with the drinks and takes our dinner order.. antipasti, a rustica and a tricolore.. I asked if I could have prosciutto put on top.. you know what he says.. ""Ill ask the chef if you can have that.. he doesn't like changing HIS pizza's"".. I cocked my head at him (I think the vein in my forehead was ready explode) ""he doesn't like to change his pizza's"".. if you offer toppings on the menu for an up-charge, wouldn't you think they would actually give them to you? Talk about the dang pizza nazi! The waiter returns a few moments later or the 'chefs messenger'  (I think he was sweating) tells me that the chef has agreed to let me have the proccutio but only on a plate. Oh thank you thank you oh lord oh messiah! 

Can you believe this place?

While the food was good the attitudes here has really put me off.. so the 2 stars are for food only.. the Mr and I will never come to this place again.. Cibo has officially been scratched from our minds. Oh, I will be sending this review to them as well.. that way if they even care, which I doubt, they will address not only the bartenders attitude (little scruffy guy) but the idea that the customer pays their light bill and tells all of their friends about the place!",12,8,2

You can't go wrong here...their caprese, spek and pulled pork sandwiches are among my faves (served with a nice, lightly dressed house salad or fresh fruit, yogurt and crunchy granola - skip the chips because they're just store bought in a bag), and if you are lucky enough to go on a day when they have their meatball sandwich special, don't even hesitate - it's so delicious.

Also, consider having a private party at their adorable carriage house, it's separate from the main restaurant and used for parties of 10+. I went to lunch with 10 or so coworkers and we reserved it; the service was awesome and we had the place all to ourselves! 

My only small gripe with Cibo is their refusal to split checks; I just think it's really annoying when restaurants refuse to recognize the reality of modern dining that more often than not, people in a group are not going to all be paying as one. They're nice enough when you ask them to split it evenly between credit cards, though, so as I said, it's only a minor complaint.",2,0,1

My boyfriend ordered the Parmesan sandwich and it looked quite tasty. We both had the house salad which was good. The house chips are Miss Vicky's and brought to you sealed in their original bag.

We tried the T&K salad and the Salsiccia Con Patate (sausage and roasted potato) pizza.  Liked the ingredients of the salad made of spinach, oranges, cranberries, pumpkin seeds and goat cheese.  The dressing was not as flavorful as I expected.  Maybe it was the bowl it was served in.  Dressing was at the bottom and was not tossed well with the salad which made the spinach very bland.

Pizza and the dough was delicious.  My one criticism I have as with all other sausage pizzas from other establishments is how much they skimp on the sausage.  Definitely should be more when you are paying $14.5 for a pizza.  I would also slice the potatoes on the pizza instead of diced.

Will definitely return to try the other pizzas.",0,0,0

Being a pizza snob, I take my pizza seriously!

I had been to Cibo long ago but was discouraged by the fact that this place, which labels itself as a ""pizzeria"" did not serve any pizza during lunch.  A fact that was never mentioned over the years by all the rave reviews, in advertisements, or even on their own website.  I'm sure many others experienced the disappointment of finding this out on their first visit.  

The news that they had recently started to serve pizza options for lunch prompted me to finally return.  Though I should note that (at this point) your pizza choices are limited to only four selections, nothing like the nearly two dozen options available at dinner.

Cibo's pizza harkens back to the traditional pizza from Napoli, however it falls short of accomplishing this feat, and for those who have experienced ""authentic"" pizza, this comes across as a failed attempt.  However, it is definitely a step up from average pizza place.

I ordered the Salsiccia Pizza, which has tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and sausage. The crust is made from ""00"" flour, cooked in a fired oven and is soft and appealing, however it fails at the trademark chewiness, and is lacking any type of character development.  In other words...bland.

I was very happy with the fresh mozzarella and more so with the real fennel sausage, however the tomatoes lacked any brightness, and were lost under the other, more aggressive flavors.

My pizza was barely seven inches, and was cut in eight pieces, which made the slices too narrow to handle the toppings, so attempting to eat this by hand resulted in more toppings returning to the plate, than were entering my mouth.

Cibo resides in a rehabilitated home on 5th Avenue, which is small, but inviting.  They have a small lot, and on street parking is shared with other businesses and residences, so parking can be an issue.

Overall the pizza is decent, however, why would I bother to return here when I can get much better (and larger) pizza at either of the two ""Certified"" authentic pizzerias that are just blocks away?",1,0,0

What's that you say? Pizza? Wait, you want the best pizza in Arizona? But with class? With taste? With, what? ATMOSPHERE? Oh damn. Have I got the place for you. Not only is their wine selection to die for, but if you have never had the pleasure of tasting a fine Limoncello, than saddle up partner: because Cibo is your destination of choice! Their Limoncello and Chococello are like nothing on this continent. I would say that they give Naples a run for their money. Shit, they give your Italian Grandmother a run for her money!

When you go here, try the 4 cheese pizza. If you love cheese, this is for you. There is a kick there, that will have your mouth watering for more! And their crepes, please. No comparison anywhere in town. 

I heart Cibo. This is my restaurant of choice in Arizona. When friends or family come to visit I bring them here. Hot date with my man? Cibo! My birthday? Cibo! My dog died? Cibo! .... you get the idea.

Romantic, fun, girls night out, boys night out, family night out, work night, school night, hot night, cool night. It's raining men night and so on. Cibo!",4,4,2

The lunch menu consists entirely of sandwiches and salads. I was in the mood for some hot food, this along with my love affair of cheese lead me to try the hot multi cheese sandwich. I did not know what to expect as on the menu it sounded like a grilled cheese sandwich.  My arrived on a plate with a small side of Cesar like salad.  The salad had a nice topping of shaved Parmesan, and the sandwich had a generous amount of micro greens in addition to the cheese. The micro greens gave the sandwich a nice bitterness to contrast the fattiness of the cheese. The crunch and slight char taste of the brick oven chibata style bread tied the entire thing together.

My bosses meal came on a old chipped plate, as if the kitchen had run out of the nice contemporary plates. This was troublesome as it was against health code. His meal of a cold meat sandwich and fruit salads looked appetizing as well.

I have been wanting to check out this place for a while now and finally got the opportunity. We called ahead and made reservations for our group of 7 and were seated right away when we arrived. Unfortunately their parking lot was full, but we were able to find street parking not too far away. First off, it was way way too hot and stuffy in there. They really need to work on their air conditioning, or at least get some fans in there to circulate some air. Second, the finishing on their tables makes them appear dirty. It was so sticky and uncomfortable. We tried cleaning it, but it is just the table finish. Even the napkins stuck to the table. Third, I had my one year old son with me and no one ever offered a high chair. We eventually found one on our own. Fourth, it took forever for the waitress to come see us and get our drink orders. 

In regards to the food, I had the pizza and it was decent. Nothing too amazing, but it was good and it was gone before we left.

My opinion has not changed. The food was edible, some fresh-ish such as the mozzarella on the margarita pizza but it was not explosively so and frankly lacked any flavor at all (as compared to other fresh mozzarellas which can be incredibly delicious despite lacking much ""flavor"".... ) The prosciutto my four year old ordered as a side to his kids' pizza (hey, he's a foodie!) was sub par quality but he gobbled it! The sauces on the pizza and pasta were ""spaghetti'o"" tasting per my husband and I kind of agree. No fresh Parmesan... disappointing. 

And overall, while it's a kid friendly setting, my husband an I both felt like our server was merely tolerating the existence of our two kids who were at her table. She was pleasant enough and was in no way rude or sub-par as far as her duties, but really didn't seem to be into having kids in her section. I get it, we're a pain, we're messy, we know it ... but we tip well and would prefer to feel like we didn't have to leave asap.

During my recent visit, I split the pesto salad and funghi pizza with my cousin. The bread brought out was ok, crusty but a little too chewy and cold. I appreciate having oil on the table to dip. The salad was good. I absolutely loved the roasted potatoes on top. Way better than traditional croutons. The dressing was ok; I thought it could use more of a garlic kick.

Overall, the pizza was just good. I remember it being excellent. The sauce was bad. Bland and a bit too bitter. Good quality cheese. Again, I needed more of a ""kick"" from the toppings. No strong earthy flavors from the mushrooms. Crust was by far the best part.

Service was slow and inattentive but friendly. Value was good since we only spent $22 for our items. I was very full the rest of the night and even had leftover pizza for my husband to sample.

We had an excellent time.  The food was fantastic, the staff friendly and efficient, and the environment (a bungalow-style house) was charming.  
We had another engagement so we ate early and were able to be seated immediately.  I'm told the restaurant is very busy at a later time.  We ate indoors, although the patio looked inviting as it was quiet and had misters.  
My party shared the bruschetta appetizer (two each of three different kinds, one better than the next), a pizza, and the house salad.  All were delicious.  My niece opted for dessert and chose the Nutella and marscapone crepe with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  (She can do that ... she's still young.)  Mom and I each had a bite and pronounced it heavenly.  I can't speak to the beverages as we just had water (which needed to be filtered).  
The meal wasn't inexpensive but most restaurants in that area are pricey (if they even serve dinner, as that is an office neighborhood with many places serving breakfast & lunch only). 
I will definitely return as my sole complaint was with the complimentary H2O.  The next time I'll pay for bottled water.",0,0,0

Or maybe the Quattro Formaggi and La Noce.
We ALWAYS begin with the Burrata starter. More than enough for two people. In fact, I'm tempted to ask if we can get a 1\/2 order. The wine list is modest and won't make you wince when you see the prices. If you're still hungry, the Fresca from the Dolci menu is simply amazing. The fruit crepe is MORE than enough for two people.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Chef Guido make 3 homemade pasta dishes, usually around $13-15 per plate. Amazing stuff.

Cibo is one of them.  We went there for lunch and service was prompt and friendly.  Pomo Pizzeria (the VPN certified pizzeria in Scottsdale & Phoenix) used to be my number one pizza place, but Cibo has won me over!  You can taste the quality ingredients and everything is absolutely delicious!  

What we ordered:
Salmone Sandwich
Cold sandwich consisting of smoked salmon, cream cheese, sprouts, arugula, and capers. Served on an amazing saltimbocca bread that's baked fresh with every order in their wood burning oven!  Comes with delicious garden salad sprinkled with pine nuts.  Absolutely fabulous sandwich!  Healthy too!

Polpette Sandwich
Homemade meatballs in tomato sauce with melted mozzarella.  Served on an amazing saltimbocca bread that's baked fresh with every order in their wood burning oven! Perfect sandwich with oozing cheese!  Yum!

Diavola Pizza
Lunch size pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella and spicy salame.  Very good!

Di Notte Pizza
Fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola, mozzarella and spicy salame.  Their crust is perfectly thin, chewy, and crispy.  Puffed up on the side like they should be, and absolute delight to eat!",2,2,3

As you can tell by now from the sheer amount of 4 and 5 star reviews, this place has got it going on like Donkey Kong (sorry). 

In no particular order, here are some of my favorite things about Cibo: 

1. It's right next door to Tammie Coe! We love us some red velvet cupcakes that Ms. Coe bakes up, so it's almost a little too perfect that two of our most favorite things in Phoenix are right across the street from each other!! 

2. The pizza of course silly! Last time we tried three of their pizza's and they were all phenomenal. You could order cow dung and bird feathers on pizza and they would make it taste moist and delicious, that's how good they are! This pizza reminds me a lot of the pizza they serve at the almighty Pizzeria Bianco....and that's saying something. 

3. Simon Crown! Who is Simon Crown you ask? Why, he's only the greatest keyboard player west of the Mississippi! Well, that might be a slight stretch, but he is a really cool black dude who plays catchy and happy melodies on weekends while you eat in the outdoor patio and wait to be seated. He even sells his CD there for $15, but he only accepts cash so make sure to bring some extra spending money next time you go to Cibo so you can support a unique local artist! 


4. Great for people watching. Cibo was voted one of the best places to go on a first date in Phoenix, so you'll be sure to see lot's of awkwardness between couples of all ages. It could even turn into a fun game while you wait to be seated....like, who can be the first person to spot the couple on their first date? 

Well, even if none of the aforementioned reasons for visiting Cibo strikes your fancy, you've just got to bite the bullet and try this place already! I promise you won't go home disappointed (unless you're a real jerk).",8,8,6

Our server, Matt appeared immediately gleaming in his RUN-DMC t-shirt and I was ready to rap myself in great food from the beginning. The mozarella appetizer was delightful as was the antipasto. My mushroom pizza was thin crusted and delicious, and our guests from North Carolina were impressed.

I LOVE Cibo for dinner, it is one of my favorites downtown. I assumed their brunch would be just as good. 
We decided to sit inside as it was a rather warm morning and we walked (trying to burn some of the calories we were about to consume). We sat at a table right buy the window over looking the patio (which is dog friendly). As we perused the menu a fly kept buzzing around the table. I understand flies get in and I'm OK with that, BUT this one fly turned into about 8 full sized flies and a million little gnats. I was actually killing the bugs as they flew around our table there were SO MANY! We even had some fall in our drinks. Ugh!
The food was good. we ordered the Uova Arizona and Fritatta Melfitana. They were both good but the Uova Arizona was the best. 
I am so sad that the flies ruined an otherwise wonderful breakfast. I guess we should have sat outside...there would have been fewer bugs.",2,2,2

Great eggplant parm sandwich (recommended by the waitress) on that saltimbocca bread.  One friend had a sausage sandwich and another friend (vegetarian) had his usual, caprese sandwich; both raved about their food.  Price is right at about $9 per sandwich.  Too bad they don't serve pizza for lunch; I'll have to come back some time for dinner.

My husband lived in Italy for a while and I'm from Brazil. We like fresh authentic food. This place is cute, nice atmosphere. Service was ok, we waited a while to be seated even though they were not busy. Took several minutes to get us menus. We ordered a white pizza and a margherita pizza. Both were OK only. I found the crust hard and dry. The desert menu had only nutella products... 

The taste was blend for the most part. You could not taste quality or freshness out of the pizzas and appetizers we had. The taste was Americanized for sure. 

The menu had a huge selection, kind of overwhelming. Nothing special about the food or the place, over priced actually. The pizza sauce tasted like a can product. We will not be coming back. We will keep POMO Pizzeria as our place for good pizza. To add, the place is a bit too dark. The live music outside was nice but we wish the guy had a better sound\/voice so we could try to enjoy being there. The kids liked though.

It came out with 4 meats (which was nice) but only 2 cheeses (1 which was a caprese salad with no basil), 2nd was the goat cheese like on the menu, and for the 3d cheese...they threw on the pear salad...but with no pears. Then the fruits! I got 3 slices of apple. Instead of 3 separate fruits, it was 3 apple slices. Instead of fruit, they sent out grilled veggies??? No. Not cool. I asked the lady for some fruit she came out with the kids fruit plate.  ok thats fine. I like my fruit cut up for that anyway .my kids didn't like the pasta (red sauce and plain) not sure how that got messed up but it was really bland.  Anyways...then when I got the check I got charged for the fruit plate. Ok out of an $80 check, what's $3? But still...I don't feel like I should pay $3 for something that should've been on the $20 plate. When I asked the waiter, instead of apologizing he got super pissy and turned around (like a diva) and said ""ok I'll take it off"" like not even being I'm any way caring that he gets tips. So then him and some other girl were talking about what shouldve been on the plate (I was proven right) then be rudely came back with the check and kind of tossed it in front of me and said ""thanks"".
