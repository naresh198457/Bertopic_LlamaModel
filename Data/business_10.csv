Luckily there was not much of a wait at 6:30pm and we were able to justify the price since they served king crab legs. It is served cold but you can ask them to heat it up. Also, when there is no line up, you can ask the servers to give you a plate full instead of grabbing it at the counter. They also served snow crab legs, mussels, and shrimps as other seafood choices.

For five bucks extra you can indulge in the unlimited champagne during Brunch. Last memorial day me and about 30 of my old college friends decided to reserve three tables and let the champagne makes us even more ridiculous.

Champagne aside they serve fillet Mignon for breakfast! I find it very difficult to find Eggs Benedict at a regular breakfast joint but the Bellagio Brunch will make you cry tears of joy. They have crab legs and buckets upon buckets of shrimp. The desserts are rich and plentiful as well as the exotic fruit .The service was great and we stayed until they served sushi for Lunch.

It's been nearly a year since I've eaten here (What can I say? I procrastinate.), but I was pleased with everything I put on my plate. We arrived just after they had put their sushi station up, so I was a little disappointed that I couldn't try it, but like I said, everything that I tried was delicious. Their mini sliders were probably my favorite, but who can go wrong with mini cheeseburgers? I definitely kept the cute little plastic emblem sticks they put in each one. 
The desserts were lovely, and mightly delicious as well. Not to mention, the display of beautifully decorated cakes on top of the dessert cases. Absolutely stunning. But, the desserts were also tiny. Not kidding, I could have eaten about 8 of those little squares of sweet delectable goodness. But I was already full to the brim with sliders, roasted potatoes and prime rib.

i went on a tuesday, no wait.  went in at 3pm for the lunch price like what the other yelpers suggested to do, and ate lunch and dinner food.  The only difference between lunch and dinner was that they offered sashimi and instead of flank steak, they had prime ribs.  Big whoop.  

Most of the yelpers said it's one of the best buffets in Vegas.  After I started eating for a while, I wondered if I actually went into the right hotel....  To think that Bellagio is one of the bigger and nicer hotels and yet they fail to even make sushi, wow that sucks.  Their super generic sushi is even worse than ones at Safeway.  Heck, even my friends can make better sushi than that!! 

The flank steak was chewy as heck.  the leg of lamb tasted more like duck.  I only went to this buffet a few days ago, and I can't even remember what I ate because nothing stood out!!!

after a weekend of drinking and general debauchery in vegas with friends, we decided that we had to see what the fuck the hype was about with this buffet.  it is worth every moment you spend standing in line and every penny. we went for late breakfast, and caught some of the lunch as it was getting set up (hell yeah we stayed for two meals, dont judge us!) the options are amazing, tons of veggie creations, sushi, soup and some of the best bbq salmon i've ever had. none of that shitty greasy, hate yourself in the morning (well maybe a little of that) factor you find at most buffets. you absolutely have to get down with your inner fat kid here when you're in town. you have failed at vegas if you don't.",1,1,0

I must say that it was a huge disappointment.  I used to be a fan of the Rio seafood buffet, but it has gone way down in quality over the years so I was really looking forward to getting some King Crab legs at the Bellagio, even though it is chilled and not steamed.  

To my dismay, the crab was not good.  Both the King & Snow crab had no flavor and some of it actually smelled like it was bad.  But I am not basing my review on the dismal crab.

I had read many posts about how good the Kobe beef, and the Beef Wellington were, and numerous other items that were great, and they just weren't all that good.  

The ""Kobe"" beef tasted like dry roast beef.  The Beef Wellington was ok(never had it before), but it didn't knock my socks off.  The Lamb chops were a bit gamey, and I've had lots of Lamb.  One of the best things I've ever tasted was a  Lamb Chop on the Oregon Coast, and this wasnt' even close.

The sushi smelled foul and I only could muster up the courage to try the tuna, which was about what I would expect at a low dollar buffet. 

The only high point was the Prime Rib and the very large & tasty Peel & Eat shrimp.  The Prime Rib was very good & the au jus was also really good.  The Prime Rib isn't as good as Lowry's Prime Rib, but it is top notch for Buffet Prime Rib.  I've had many disappointments with buffet Prime Rib, and the Bellagio isn't one of them.  

There were also a couple of vegitable dishes & other sides that were good, but for the price, I expected way more.  The buffet at Green Valley Ranch is a third of the cost, and the quality of the food is much better.  Not as much selection of high end stuff, but when the crab, Kobe Beef, & Sushi all suck really bad, the point becomes moot.

I gave it two stars because between the peel & eat shrimp & the good Prime Rib, I think I got my $$ worth.",2,1,1

the variety was simply lacking. and worst of all, the quality was abysmal. there was nothing that i wanted to eat, and everything that i did eat was sub-par at best. i was stunned at the fact that the carving station only offers medium or well-done prime rib. it was far too overcooked for my taste, and the carver was rude and unskilled. after asking multiple times to slice the prime rib thinly, he continued to carve 2 inch thick slices to patrons. everyone was frustrated with the carver, his rudeness, and just the appalling waste of food because he was incapable of slicing anything less than a size of a brick.

another shocking discovery was the installation of soft serve machines and the disappearance of hand scooped gelato. this utterly disgusted me and was the final nail in the coffin. who the hell wants drippy icy ooze that melts the minute it hits the bowl? it was worse than the local sizzler.

Had to ask the waiter twice before we finally got them filled up but by then we were pretty much done eating. My first piece of prime rib was very good and juicy, went back but second piece was dry.

I have to reveal the fact that they on purpose, in my opinion, put EXTREME salt into the crab legs making guests take less. On the day we were there, the first plate of crab legs were like normal and quickly taken away by the line of guests. Then there came the really salty ones dispelled the whole line as well as our appetite. Shame on such buffet restaurant! The breakfast, however, is on average so deserves another star.",0,0,0

The food was really good-- just what I expected from a Vegas buffet! The prime rib was excellent. The ""Kobe"" beef was a little off in flavor (I've had it in Kobe, and this didn't taste like that), but still delicious. The sushi, despite so many warnings against sushi on Vegas buffets, was delicious. The desserts were absolutely amazing. I couldn't choose and just ended up getting one of almost every kind! The crab was tasty but I missed having a butter dipping sauce for sure.

It was more like a over priced Home Town Buffet than a 5 star buffet. The made to order omelets were that same as the omelets you get at El Torito Sunday buffet, which are good. The prim rib was very disappointing, it tasted like boiled meat. This was the first time I had ever tried eggs Benedict and they were disgusting. I hate to throw away food, but I had to push my plate to the side and let our waitress take it. The rest of my party assured me that eggs Benedict tastes a lot better than what was being served at this buffet, I guess I will give them one more try at a different restaurant. Just about every item that I tried reminded me of cafeteria food and if I didn't try it it was because it wasn't very appealing. I would rate the dessert bar 4 stars, the dining area was extremely outdated and helped support my thinking of this place as a cafeteria. Not that there is anything wrong with cafeterias but for $32 a person I was expecting a lot better all around. The night before, we dined at Tao in the Venetian and the average was $30 a plate and I will rate them 5 stars as soon as I am done with this. I would definitely NOT recommend this buffet.

Disappointment.. I ate at Bellagio probably at least 3 times before this time... I have to said.. I'm disappointed with the food choice.

I almost never I try a buffet that is even remotely passable in terms of quality, taste and preparation. The Buffet at the Bellagio is one of those exceptions; in fact it by far surpasses any buffet I have ever found. 

Here you will find a huge selection of food, anything from beef, pork, lamb, seafood and even vegetarian. Everything I sampled would rival entrees from most any sit down restaurant you will find. For me the highlight was the Alaskan King Crab legs, they were perfectly cooked, large, meaty and pre-split. It's rare that I find crab of this quality. I find the prime rib equally prepared, cooked to a perfectly medium rare. The various pork and chicken dishes were excellent. Of the vegetable sides I sampled the mashed potatoes (real potatoes), green beans, corn, salad, etc., all were delicious. Of the few breads I sampled were also very good. In short this was a buffet that really was one of the best meals I had had in quite a while, I left satisfied and overstuffed. 

Now the bad, at just under $40 it's quite expensive. It's also a good idea to try and arrive just about opening, the lines can get quite long.

Being a Las Vegas Local I expect much more for the amount of money we spent to eat here. My wife and I decided to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary and  treat ourselves to ""something a bit fancier"" than the local casinos have to offer.  I read the reviews prior to going and still made a conscious decision to take my wife here. Shame on me as I was forewarned. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by a Hispanic host who was just shuffling people. No greeting, no ""welcome""..no nothing. Just a ""how many?"".  After paying approx $78 for 2 of us, we were seated in a back corner by a lady who appeared to be from the African continent based by her accent.  This seating area ad a really bad stench in the area. I immediately asked if we could move to another area and pointed to much better lit and cleaner area. She was very blasé and stated ""that area is closed!"".  She didn't offer to seat us elsewhere..she just continued on to the next group of people. 

After being seated we headed to the food counters and found a delightful assortment of food. With my mouth watering, I began to pile on the food to take back to our unacceptable booth. The food was lacking with that ""POP"" of flavor that one would expect when paying this much for dinner! The food was bland, merely warm, and after 20-30 having dinner I felt nauseous for a couple hours. I want to make it clear this was not from over eating!!  To sum it up, the executive chefs at this buffet who over see the quality of the food are not worth a damn. Shame on them for letting crap be served to tourists and visitors that come to our beautiful city and then leave with an experience as my wife and I experienced. We will not be going back.  By far, this buffet should NOT be on the top 10 list to try. I understand that the next persons experience may be different due to different people working different shifts...but the lack of quality to the food...there is just no excuse.

It was awesome to be able to come down from our room, in desperate need of coffee and not have to walk a long ways or take a taxi to get it! That requires too much effort in the morning!

There is an omelet station that has a large variety of toppings, including crab and shrimp!  Yum!  Other hot choices include eggs benedict, lovely bacon, sausages, several potato dishes, waffles, pancakes, french toast, breakfast burrito bar, and many other options.  There was a large variety of fruits, cereals, salads, yogurts, pastries, etc.  Many lovely desserts.  The quality of all the  food we had was quite good.

Service was great the first morning--the server kept our orange juice and coffee filled without our having to ask.  Service the second time was not quite as good, just mediocre.  There was a large selection of juices and other drinks to choose from, all included in the price.  They were continually replenishing the food items, so I was not worried about anything sitting out for too long.

This place is mobbed, but the second day we were seated in a side dining room, which was much more quiet and less chaotic.  

The line was out to the lobby both times, we waited no longer than 10-15 minutes either time.  The line moved fast.   I would recommend going for a late breakfast (around 10:30) if you want a variety of breakfast and lunch items.

She kept saying ""4 at one table, 4 at another"" she didn't speak very good English so trying to explain that her math included only 8 when our party was 10 was another ordeal. She was very concerned about the 18% gratuity for larger groups when we already said that wasn't an issue. We had already been waiting about 40 minutes while she ran around confused and inspected our tickets to get in. She left our 10th party member behind the rope because she clearly couldn't count to ten for most of this time. When we finally got in and seated our server was very nice and attentive.
The food was good but not as delicious as their breakfast. I probably wouldn't go for brunch again. Or with a party larger than 4 but there are a lot of buffet choices on the strip so I probably wouldn't go here again at all.",0,0,0

Aside from the prime rib (it was good but small) they were serving up Kobe beef the night I went.

The sushi sucked, but then again I've never had good sushi at a buffet anywhere... i think you need to actually go to a sushi restaurant for good sushi.

Sadly, at least during lunch on weekdays, there were no crab legs. Just shrimp. Boo. In their defense, though, it seemed like most of the strip buffets we went to for lunch were no longer doing crab legs. Maybe there is a shortage? Maybe it is just a dinner thing now?

Also I had the turkey at the carving station and this time it was cooked gorgeously. That with the mashed potatoes, gravy and cranberries was like Thanksgiving in May. Yum yummy.

I would enjoy a bit more selection in the sushi roll department and I am still missing the caprese salad at the salad bar but everything I had this trip was delicious. However, I recommended the pesto shrimp pizza to my friend and when we went to go get her a slice they had just put out a whole one right from the oven...and it was incredibly undercooked. The crust wasn't even slightly brown so she skipped it.

Pros
Clean and beautiful surrounding
Prime rib, almost as good as House of Prime Rib
Pastas, delicious, better than North Beach
Shrimp cocktail and crab legs, nice and fresh
Desserts and fruit were for repeat offenders, especially the napolean
Service was okay, 15% tipping

Cons
Sushi Bar, I don't think so, didn't even try it
Venison, lamb chopsand  beef wellington, way too done

Now, it just feels like a zoo, feeding troughs and all. Compared to The Buffet at Bellagio of the past, the current buffet is just bad.

Beyond the decline in the quality of the food, it's hard for me to identify exactly what's contributing to the overall negative experience: Are there more tables crammed into the dining areas? Is there more foot traffic because diners have to fetch their own drinks? Did someone remove acoustic tiles in the ceiling?

I'm guessing All of the Above and more.

查理在感恩節時造訪並無遇上任何排隊人潮，看來在眾多新穎的飯店和所屬自助餐開設後，這個老牌的自助餐餐廳是受到不少影響。在特殊節日時提供的用餐內容比起一般時段豐富，當然價格也比較高。

這裡的用餐內容並不包括無限制點用的酒精性飲料，如果想點酒來配餐的話，這個位於用餐區中央的吧台就是一個獨特的設計，近期也可以在用餐外加額點用把啤酒、紅酒等酒精性飲料也可以無限暢飲。

以溫暖的黃色燈光為主，室內的採光是有些許昏暗，但也營造出典雅富麗的用餐環境。每個區餐區與整體用餐環境的佈置都可以看得出來經營團隊的心思，走走逛逛心情也跟著愉悅起來。坐定位後直奔造訪自助餐時首要的「攻擊目標」，看到數量眾多的蟹腳交疊而成的小山，瞬間讓人心底的期待獲得解放。

同時能夠吃到帝王蟹與雪蟹蟹腳，應該是在特殊的節日才有的福利，而當晚提供的是鮭魚魚子醬，當然也有各種壽司類的餐點。壽司類的餐點雖然採用的魚料都算新鮮，但是預先採用機器捏製的飯糰，乾硬的口感讓人有些難以入口。

雪蟹是一般是在自助餐中最常出現的主力食材，這裡的雪蟹蟹腳不愧是招牌的食材，肉質纖細多汁每一口都是吃到滿滿的甜味，滴一些檸檬汁提鮮保證是會讓人吃著一盤接著一盤的美味。帝王蟹確實是會讓人暫時失去理智大量拿取的食材，帶有更豐滿的肉質造裡說風味也更出色，但意外的是這次吃到的帝王蟹在肉質本身的甜味還不如雪蟹，吃了一盤就回到雪蟹的擁抱了。

火烤肉食區通常都是在蟹腳之外另外一個在自助餐中會吸引人大排長龍的區域。遺憾的是不知道是不是當天的廚師閃神失誤，幾種肉品吃起來都有烤得過熟過老的問題，靠著出色的醬料調味勉強吃完。

肉質厚實飽滿的智利圓鱈Chilean Sea Bas，以中式的醬汁來調味，也是一道用料相當實在、不可錯過的佳餚。對喜歡美國南方風味小龍蝦風味的顧客來說，看到這一盤的內容相信是會讓人興奮的，實際上的口味也挺道地的。整體的熟食風味算是在海鮮之外讓人印象最為深刻的，各種食物的口味都還不差，每種都夾一些來試試來滿足好奇心。

雖然整體的內容到說不上讓人驚艷的部份，但是各種食物的都算是帶有一定的水準，尤其是雪蟹蟹腳的甜度更是讓人帶有甚客印象。近期在週末晚餐時段的 Gourmet Dinner，自助餐內容還囊括了吃到飽魚子醬等帶給顧客更豐富的餐點內容、且在平時也可以用合理的價格來點用喝到飽的酒精性影料、週末也有提供可以加價喝到飽的香檳自助餐，有機會再來回味這間作為查理對於賭城自助餐美食的啟發的知名自助餐。",0,0,0

Lots of times you go to a buffet and it's snow crab, but this one was Alaskan king crab.  The great thing was that it was already sliced in half.

Of course the crab is cold since it's was on ice, but our waiter told us to take it to one of the chefs and he would gladly steam it for us.

So my friend''s hubby took our big plate of crab and got it steamed to perfection.  So while the others were eating dessert, I was eating my fill of crab and my friend's hubby was eating his fill of poke.

The line was really long, but like everything else in Vegas, the dining area is huge and since it's a buffet the line moves pretty fast.

Food: Why are the crab legs always cold?  Can't they serve them hot for once?  I don't like to eat any seafood cold.  The desserts were probably the best but like any other mass produced food, the best was the creme brulee and the strawberry tart with vanilla pudding on the bottom.  The sushi was mediocre being laid out and people taking mass quantity at one time.  This is a buffet, leave some for the people in line won't ya?  The meats were okay but with all the people hoarding the food, the presentation lacked its luster.

Service:  We were fortunate to get chosen from the line with the number of people in our party (so avoided a 2 hour wait so we heard).  We ended up sitting at the bar area and the staff was very pleasant and nice.  

Layout: Like most buffets, they try to separate things however with the seafood and meats compacted in the same area, better to spread out the lines instead of cramming them through the sitting area.  I did not want to do any of those lines, so mostly salads, desserts, and italian for me.  There was not a lot of varied selection which I found surprising.

The wait was nonexistent and depends what time and day you go. Although you would think 5 pm Sat would be a wait. It wasn't due to what I observed
hard working individuals from the cashier to the hostess and shift manager who visibly were on task, not distracted with other things and making it their priority to maintain a rhythmic flow of happy guests. My waiter Alfonso was very busy but you can see how hard they work day in and day out to serve thousands of people from all over the world to survive. They will gladly bring you more beverages or coffee if you request.
There's an overabundance of food choices and chefs are readily available to suggest and inform what they like best for example between prime rib and beef roast. You will also find crab legs sliced lengthwise so you don't worry about cracking them. If you have kids, there's pizza, and the cheesiest Mac n cheese on cute white ceramic miniature bowls. Greek foods, salads and not to mention the desserts galore that include sugar free. Sushi, Italian,list goes on.

The sea bass I had was average, definitely not as good as when we make it at home, and the piece of bluenose I had was completely dry. The veal was not bad, fell off the bone easily enough.  The one thing that really killed this whole meal for me was the kobe beef. I saw my bf get a piece and thought I would give it a try, but the piece I got was sooo rare in the center that it was still bleeding.  My bf assured me it was still edible and so I did give it several bites, but the taste pretty much killed my appetite for any other kinds of meat for the night.  So I ate two more plates of dessert since I figure they should be harmless.  The creme brulee and chocolate covered strawberries were my favorites. To top it all off, within 5min of leaving the buffet I had to immediately look for a bathroom.

Many of us have eaten at the Bellagio buffet in the past and before the trip I think I would have called it my favorite buffet on the strip.  The selections on this buffet were the normal good stuff with peppercorn crusted steak, king crab legs, crab claws, whole roasted pig and others.  Sadly they didn't have any beef Wellington on this evening which was one of my favorite things here in the past.  My first trip up consisted mostly of steak and other meats and I really enjoyed it.  Then my second trip up I went for both the crab legs and crab claws.  Upon getting back to my seat i found the king crab legs to be somewhat frozen (aka you would get some ice in the bites but they were edible) and the crab claws were completely frozen.  So I asked to speak to a manager and told him my concerns.  I was polite and wasn't asking for a handout and he told me that sometimes the claws on the other side of the buffet were better and he would get me some.  Fair enough.  So I headed back to my seat and a minute of two later he came back with some claws.  I touched one and felt the iciness of it and told him they were frozen.  He proceeded to crack a claw, water going everywhere including on his suit, and told me they weren't frozen.  I looked into the claw to see a slushy mixture that was clearly still half frozen.  What could I do though - get in a pissing match with the manager?  So he ended up leaving without a resolution and the crab claws would all get taken away without any being eaten.

The bottom line for me is that I don't think I will be heading back to this buffet.  While our server was good, the buffet seems to have lost some of its luster and I wasn't a fan of the manager.",3,0,0

Yes those were the words used to describe buffets. Furthermore, brunch is extremely popular on the weekends. So, in light of all the hype, my group and I went here for a Saturday brunch. 

My father was the one who recommended the Bellagio to me. For brunch, they offer a champagne breakfast. Unlimited mimosas and champagne with your brunch for $12. Naturally, I was curious and decided to try.

Just to be clear, buffet here, even without the champagne add-on, is expensive. This place is NOT for those on a budget. That said, I find with buffets, all you need is to eat at one and you are good for the rest of the day (with snacks here & there).  So we go to buy our meal ""tickets"" and I agree with other yelpers that the service here SUCKS. The lady was rude to us. And the couple beside us buying tickets received even worse service. They didn't speak much english and the lady serving them was getting annoyed at their questions. 

Despite that situation, we were excited to try out the buffet. Once seated, we got our drinks and our server was amazing. He was serving so many people yet we never had empty drinks and he was constantly on the prowl to pour us more water, champagne and juice. 

As for the fun part... THE BUFFET :D

loved it. I can't say it any other way. Oodles of selection and the food was GOOD. I find some buffets just offer stuff without much flavour but hey! At least you leave full. At Bellagio, you leave satisfied, full and happy after eating all the good food!

Fruits, veggies, sushi, meats, cheese, pizza... and that's just the tip of the iceberg. There's everything and you HAVE to go to the dessert area. ooooooomagosh. Everything and anything is three different flavours.

I did enjoy the prime rib, which I was excited about. The turkey and mashed potatoes were pretty good too. The Asian and Italian dishes were all awful, and I tried multiple ones. The pizza did not look appealing at all. 

The saving grace was the taco bar and the dessert options. I especially enjoyed the chocolate eclairs and tiramisu. 

Also, despite the location at Bellagio, I felt that the Buffet decor was a bit dated and I was not impressed with it. 

Service was good though, and the price was reasonable. All in all though, I wouldn't go back. If you are a fan of seafood though, I would suggest checking it out.",7,6,5

Let's just start there and acknowledge that the price is NOT worth it. 

The selection was a lot less than I expected. Our original choice was caeser's palace's buffet but their wait was too long so we came here. There was a line but we got in about 15 minutes of waiting which wasn't horrible. Coming to the register I was shocked at the prices, but had no choice but to pay it at that point as all buffets in LV are supposedly expensive, and also my stomach was grumbling at this point. 

After a sad relcutant swipe, I had high expectations for the food at the buffet and that led to a bitter dissapointment. Their was only one small row of food, with 2\/3 dishes per cultural category. The asian section consisted of one plate of noodles and rice, very boring when there's other buffets that serve dim sum...

The beef at the amercian grill was undercooked, red with blood and not worth being the highlight of the group. Their mash potatos and the roasted turkey were good but beyond that, everything was really bad, I kept just grabbing sweet mash and mash with gravy till I got fill. There really wasn't any variety or quality happening :(

At least not these days. Maybe back when it was new and all that, but like fish sitting out, the moment it gets old it's not worth eating and should be tossed out. 

So it's really confusing as to why there's so many people lining up to this thing daily. And while I'm a huge fan of seafood, especially when you have it in Vegas where they ship in thousands upon thousands of tons of fresh fish daily, you would expect to actually find something good here. 

What you end up with is just over hyped buffet food that isn't worth the lines you're waiting in, nor the coin you're dropping to get in. 

Maybe it's just that I'm over the buffet scene. The younger me would have been all over this. In fact, I was. Back in my early 20's I would come here a lot when I came to Vegas and stuff myself with all this seafood and feel incredibility sick for the rest of the day. 

But in the many years since I've come to realize that while I'm paying for quantity, the quality sure has suffered. And really, for the amount you're paying to get in here, you're just losing yourself in the moment of trying to make the plates add up to the amount. 

You're better off just going to a nice sit down restaurant that is highly rated and has a specialty you like and enjoy the meal without feeling like you're in the rush to make your dollar count.

- Excellent array and choices of food...so much in fact that your head will spin at the endless display of food, food and more food. Almost every theme and every ethic dish is represented; from American to Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Mexican, etc

- Nice vegetable\/vegetarian dish selections from mushroom cheese raviolis with essece of truflles to the most delectable of salads. They even had Tofu dishes that I found pleasantly surprising, considering most buffets do not cater to non-meat eaters. 

- the best service we've gotten at a buffet. Our server was a more older, experienced lady. She didn't rush us out when we were the last ones at the table sucking on crab legs. She got a nice hefty tip.

- Alaskan King Crab legs, split in half for you, as were the other non-Alaskan crabs. Crab legs were on ice, cold, so I wasn't too thrilled about that. Non Alaskan crab legs were too salty to eat. The AKCLs were not as salty, meaty, but a bit watery.

- I don't eat meat but my friend had a choice of veal, rack of lamb and venison that we didn't encounter at any of the other buffets.

- desserts were not as good as the ones at the Aria. Disappointing was the fact that there were so many cookies for such a fancy hotel with such a fancy selection! Most people I suspect do not go for desserts anyway, but if you are looking for desserts, go to the Aria buffet.

What they do well, they do very very well. While the current $27.95 dinner price is higher than some, it's still not the most expensive (Wynn and Rio Seafood Buffet are more). Within a deceptively large (600 seat) series of rooms with an Italian seaside motif, Bellagio's is one of the more pleasant atmospheres for a buffet, with linen napkins and heavy silverware--but they also still have Keno. 

Strong points: 

Sushi bar, with two dedicated chefs making cut rolls, sashimi, hand rolls, dumplings, steak tartar, seaweed salad, two kinds of poke (ahi and salmon) and more... Fish quality is far above that of most other buffets.

Salad bar has a very large range of choices which according to management get changed often--including marinated tofu, quinoa salad, smoked salmon, spinach frisee, --they also do salads tossed to order.

A large selection of seafood, most of which is good quality. they do bluenose sea bass 3 different ways--because it's sustainable (it's not as tender as Chilean, but it's a nice, light fish). Also vol-au-vents to order 3-4 different ways, which aren't bad. 

Strong selection of soups, including nice red pepper bisque and mushroom-laden miso

Six kinds of brick oven pizzas, which were actually good (usually buffet pizza is wretched)

very good, properly made creamed spinach

They grill veal piccata and marsala live... but I didn't try it.

Weak points: 
Mediocre selection of Italian pasta
Authentic but small selection of Chinese
Paella was underwhelming

Broad selection of carved meats (chicken wellington?), but most aren't that impressive--I think Buffalo sirloin doesn't really lend itself to buffet service...BUT they did have PERFECT TURKEY (not overly brined), which as you probably know, isn't easy.

But of course, most people still pile on the crab legs, which are served at two stations

Desserts were underwhelming (Wynn, Cravings, Studio B all do better) but they had these little apple pie rolls that were nice...

Weekend dinners, price goes up to $35, but you get kobe beef, rack of lamb, venison and more variety...

I've been to a lot of buffets both in Las Vegas and other states. I am rather fond of buffets as I'm a big eater. The food choice is excellent and some of the food is great even as a stand alone dish. I agree with some of the other reviews that there has been somewhat of a decline over the last 10 years, but again as far as buffets go, it's still the best. I've tried the Wynn, Bacchanal at Caesar's and pretty much every other buffet on and off the strip and the quality\/taste of the Bellagio buffet is still the best. The Bacchanal has Bellagio beat as far as the sheer number of choices and the Wynn is comparable, but I still give the nod to the Bellagio. I'm actually not a big fan of the crab legs, but I found that the taste\/quality of crab legs are pretty much the same at all the top $ buffets. Bacchanal's crab legs were the mostly frozen, although the quality was fine, with the Bellagio and the Wynn pretty much the identical. I enjoyed the meat station at the Bellagio the best with Bacchanal meat station having the most choices, but lacking the quality. If I had to rate the Bellagio compared to other stand-alone restaurants, obviously it would not be 5 stars, but I think it's only fair to keep restaurants in categories. The price is around $40.00 so it's expensive for a buffet but not unreasonable compared to other high-end buffets and certainly not that expensive compared to other restaurants, where you could easily spend that much per person at the Cheesecake factory with apps, entrees and desserts.",0,0,0

I had high hopes since Bellagio is a very reputable hotel and being so I thought the buffet there would hold up to it's reputation...  After 2 plates of not so memorable food I couldn't eat anymore. 

If you want a good buffet, I suggest Bacchanal in Caesars or The Buffet at Wynn. You'll be paying a bit more but its def more worth it. Bacchanal is now offering $30 brunch before 10am.

I think it was also a little more expensive since we ordered bottomless mimosas. There's an assortment of food. The standard scrambled eggs, potatoes (both mashed and just by itself), bacon, sausage, eggs benedict, different kinds of toasts, a random Chinese food table with chow mein, fried rice, and other stuff that I chose not to get, a seafood table (I'm pregnant so I couldn't get any of the seafood), a table for steak, a dessert table with little tarts, and a fruit\/salad table. I had the eggs benedict, scrambled eggs, creamy mashed potatoes with gravy, some of the Chinese food, sausage, and obviously dessert. I wasn't a huge fan of the Chinese food or the sausage, but the scrambled eggs were perfect - they weren't dry! And the eggs benedict was awesome, even for a buffet. The hollandaise sauce was perfect! I also loved the key lime pie tart and cheesecake. They also had soft serve- chocolate, vanilla, raspberry sorbet and something else.

To avoid any disappointment, I would make sure to be cautious of what your expectations for the food will be. Reading Yelp reviews made me expect delicious crab legs, lobster, macarons, and creme brulee. When I finally went, none of these existed, except for crab legs that were ""okay"" tasting, and served very very cold. After reading more reviews and using deduction, I believe the buffet price will fluctuate (up or down) depending on what specials they might serve at the buffet, and that it won't always have the same foods. Which is a bit disappointing, since you get excited over reading reviews or hearing about it from friends, and then if you happen to go during a different day or season, you might end up having different food served. That's my biggest disappointment with this place. It'd be great if they could straight up list the highlights of food served to justify the differences in prices.

As for the buffet itself, make sure you know how to pace yourself and make sure to go only if you like variety. There is a good amount of food to try, but if you are picky and\/or don't like some of the selection, you're not going to get your money's worth unless you find the dishes you really like and stock up on those. I personally give this place 4 stars because I ate here for at least 4 hours and went out with such a happy belly.

My favorite food choices were, of course, the crab legs. At about 3:15pm, they arrive on the buffet line cold and sliced in half lengthwise. You may ask for yours to be warmed up. I also liked the Herb Crusted Rack of Lamb, the Kale with Pine Nut Salad, the Watermelon Tomato salad with watercress & Goat cheese, Coconut Mango Panna Cotta, Creme Brulee and Fresh Strawberry tarts!

First off, I expected better.  At Rio, i can usually eat something like 2-3 big plates of shrimp cocktail.  I ate 1 plate at bellagio.  It's not because I was watching my diet or trying to fit into a sexy dress at night or saving room for something else.  It was because there was something wrong.  It just didn't taste good.  How do you screw up shrimp cocktail?  

Next, the crab wasn't that good.  Usually I can eat at least 5 plates of stacked crab legs.  I mean, 5 points for cutting the king crab legs in half so you don't have to work on cracking them and getting angry and cutting your fingers trying to eat faster.  But the quality just wasn't there.  I'd rather have to crack my crab so that I could eat something tastier.  It was dry, and a hit or miss.  Probably frozen for too long.  Not fresh.  

Third, the sashimi was disgusting.  Is this what Americans think sashimi is like?  NOT fresh at all.  I couldn't eat the plate I got because I had this fear of eating bad fish.  And having eaten bad fish at one point in my life, it definitely was NOT worth the risk.  I had some spicy tuna, but come on, SPICY TUNA??? 

Next, the kobe beef wasn't kobe at all.  Why call it kobe??? Just call it beef jerky.  

The chilean bass was pretty good.  I can't believe i had something to eat.  Oh, the pesto mashed potatoes were pretty good, but come on, I'm here for seafood.  Not potatoes.  

There were no king crab claws like at rio. 

Skipped the carb dishes like bread, pastas, etc.  Not coming back.

The Bellagio buffet is half the reason I come to Vegas (okay, so maybe like 10%, but that's only because booze takes the majority).  It's not *too* expensive (about $35 for the champagne brunch) and TOTALLY WORTH IT.  Mr. Bellagio has no qualms with keeping your mimosa filled to the brim.  In fact, you might have a hard time convincing them to put in more OJ, or cranberry juice, or whatever diluent of your choice.

So that is great.  The bubbly doesn't stop, and they don't even grumble when you're falling out of your chair and hollering about how awesome our waitress is and seeing if we can take her home with us.  The vast majority of the food is pretty damn delicious, considering it's a buffet.  They have this RIDICULOUS bacon that's sliced off in 1\/4"" pieces and placed lovingly on your plate.  Next to that goes the all you can eat shrimp, which I failingly try to separate from the mass amounts of syrup covering my french toast.  The eggs benedict gets its own plate.  And every once in awhile, I'll throw on some fruit for good measure.

Oh, and the coffee is delicious.

I acquiesced, and it took another 30 minutes before we arrived at the buffet, to see a MASSIVE line.  En route, I had received a text that we were already paid for, so just go to the entrance and call them.  I felt pretty VIP status walking past probably 140 people, and having my friend greet me to walk us to our corner booth.

On to the food.  I got a few slices of duck, which was meh.  But the prime rib.  Oh my god, the prime rib was good.  I could've eaten a few more slices of that, finishing with dessert, and still felt the $40 buffet dinner was worth it.  I didn't feel any of the veggies I got were especially flavorful.

My second plate was my ""fish plate.""  Although as soon as I started eating, I realized I should've started with a soup, followed by fish, and then onto the red meats... but oh well, it's a buffet.

I was surprised with the selection of fish -- I had 4 kinds.  The first was seabass, and it was ok.  It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't get a second serving.  The 2nd was swordfish, which had a more solid texture, but the flavor left something to be desired.  The 3rd fish, I forget the name of, but the casino corn sauce or whatever its called was a surprising delight.  The last was halibut, which proved to be a major disappointment.  There was a gritty texture, and the flavor was non-existent.

I also had the mint sweet pea soup, but... well, it was ""interesting.""  One small spoonful was enough for me (well, plus a second just to reflect on the flavor).

My third plate (yea, I was weaksauce that day) was my dessert plate.  Everyone at the table exclaimed that I was a fatty, and that I better finish all that dessert.  Oh man, the dessert was what I was excited about as soon as I saw what was offered here.

The apricot mousse was flavorful.  A bit tart for my taste, but a lovely smooth texture.  They had chocolate covered strawberries too, but my friend jacked mine.  I liked the cream puff, which had a strawberry in it, but my friend thought the cream sucked.  The carrot cake was awesome.  Now, to be honest, I only got the carrot cake because this white dude swooped in to grab 3 plates of carrot cake as soon as they were put out.  And I was like ""OH SHIT, THESE MUST BE GOOD!"" to which he replied ""YEA they are! they finally made some more!""

And it was indeed GOOD.  It was moist... had a cream cheese top layer... minced carrot... ah, I don't feel like reminiscing the experience because its making me hungry.

The fruit tart was also a ""hit"" for me.  The key lime tart was my final dessert, and i was pretty stuffed, so I couldn't finish it.  But it was tangy and good.  My second biggest disappointment was not scoring a creme brulee which my brother and cousin raved about (the pastry section was out at the time).  And my biggest was being c-blocked by my friendgirl.

I was on my way to get that 2nd fish plate, when this cute girl looked my way.  But she glanced past my shoulder to see my friendgirl, so she quickly averted her eyes and moved on.  I thought about approaching her after, but she was sitting at a table with a guy that may or may not have been her bf.  I pussied out, and focused my attention on the pitting stomach pain.

4 stars became 5 stars because I didn't have a bad experience in the toilet after.  And did I mention that prime rib was fatty and delicious?",0,2,1

We were very excited to have the full Vegas experience, including a Las Vegas Buffet. After researching the buffets in the areas, we settled on the buffet at the Bellagio. 
The line was around the corner and crazy but it was Christmas so I was willing to wait for a good Christmas Dinner. 

We waited in line for three hours and paid $40 a person. The food was ok. There were crab legs and prime ribs, both of which we pretty mediocre. I wasn't impressed overall, especially after the wait. 

The reason I give this buffet only one star is based on their level of customer service. I waited in the line for beef, prime rib or turkey. When I got up to the server, I was trying to decide and turned to ask my boyfriend what he thought I should get. The server started yelling at me. He said, ""Hello. What do you want? Hello!"" He spoke to me like I was taking forever and the conversation maybe took 10 seconds and there was no one in line behind me and my boyfriend. I was so shocked by what happened. I'm pretty quiet and not used to being treated that way. I chose quickly because I was confused. When I chose, he served me and rolled his eyes. Sheesh! So much for the Christmas Spirit! 

This was ridiculous! I had waited for 3 hours in line on Christmas and paid $80. As a paying customer, I have never had anyone treat me this way.

 I asked to speak to the manager who was very receptive but distracted. He heard my complaint and went to the back of the restaurant (to talk to the employee?). He came back about 20 minutes later and apologized. He blamed the problem on the employees being ""union workers"" and offered to comp our meal. I appreciated that he dealt with the situation but I did not want a free meal. I really just wanted an apology from the person who yelled at me. I wanted to know that he was aware that his customer service skills were not acceptable. I wanted him to realize that with the state of our economy, he was lucky to be working in one of the top hotels in Vegas. I just wanted him to think about the incident and not brush it off as an unreasonable customer. The manager assured me that the situation was being ""handled"". In talking to our waiter, he mentioned that this was a common problem. 

Overall, besides this incident, I would say that the food was very mediocre at best. It was definitely not worth the 3 hour wait and if a friend asked me for a recommendation, I would promote another place.",1,0,0

While I still enjoy their caving station and seafood selection, the weekend\/holiday gourmet dinners are hardly worth the price. The prime rib is good and crab legs are enjoyable for buffet standard. Other than that, nothing really stood out. The cooked food selection had remained pretty much the same over the years and offered very little excitement for repeat customers. Quality is average and definitely does not compare to newer buffets like Wynn or Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon. 

Is it my imagination or their desserts really aren't as good anymore? Dessert used to be the only reason I still go back to Bellagio buffet. This time around a lot of the desserts I tried seemed to have sat out for a while. Creme brulee was no longer chilled and turned slightly watery. Chocolate eclair was not crispy. Many of the tart shells were soggy. The only dessert that was still good was the bread pudding, which was kept warm.

I believe the usual dinner price is $32.  What was really outrageous is that it was a 2 hour, 10 minute wait to get a table and that line moved extremely slowly!  If I had known that the wait was that long, I wouldn't have done it.  I've never in my life waited that long to eat a meal!  It was rather miserable & I hadn't eaten all day.  They actually gave people the option of paying $20 to go in the front of the line, like how they have the flash passes for the rides at amusement parks.  It was probably worth paying, but I didn't do it.

As far as the food itself, the selection was pretty good.  There's several things I'd never eat & I didn't really try them now.  But there were almost as many foods I did like, such as the pesto mashed potatoes (very tasty!), the gnocchi, shrimp cocktail, cold calamari salad, sushi, turkey, and cornbread stuffing.  Overall, I think the quality of the food is great!  This is the buffet with the crab legs that are split in half.  I didn't try them, but my boyfriend did.  He thought they were OK.  He didn't know they were chilled and they weren't as large as he thought.  There was hot melted butter to go with them, but combined with the chilled legs, it gave them a lukewarm\/funny temperature.  Many people were eating piles of them.

The dessert station here is pretty small and pathetic as well, especially compared to the buffets at the Wynn and Paris. At least the tiramisu and apple cobbler I tried were good, since many of the other desserts fell flat.

As I was trying to decide on salad selections, the server at the station praised the Thai salad, and declared it her favorite.  I have no idea why it was considered Thai-there was almost no flavor, let alone spiciness that I usually associate with Thai food.  The king crab legs were served halved lengthwise and ice cold.

 I am a foodie. I love food and am willing to spend on food. I know good food when I have it. This was just not it.  I come to vegas roughly 7-8 times a year, with at least week long visits. I love trying new food, and slowly i am getting to try all the restaurants found on the strip. 

Food 1\/5: The food here is mediocre at best. For the Bellagio being a luxury hotel the food offered at the buffet is extremely underwhelming. This buffet does not have much of a selection, and most of the food looked unappetizing. The best things were the roasted chicken, crab, tacos, and the mashed potatoes. Out of the 20 or some deserts they serve- the bread pudding was the best ( I tried each one of them). The food was just boring. 

Cost 1\/5:  On a week night ( M-TH) with tax roughly $37. We were expecting it since we are in Vegas and the buffets are infamous; so we didn't mind. But, with that cost we were expecting more of deliciousness and less of blah. With what I ate I could have went to any other place and spent a quarter of the price. Overall the cost was not worth the food at all. 

Wait time 1\/5: We went on a Monday night and we spend nearly 1 hour and 15 minutes in line. We got there around 7:15 pm and didn't enter the buffet until 8:30 or so. What was more upsetting was when we entered the buffet there were empty tables left and right. WTH?!? I was so hungry that I didn't even have the energy to complain about the poor managerial skills. After I ate, there was no sign of the manager to speak to :(. 

Service 5\/5: Once we sat down, the service was impeccable. Our waiters were so diligent, kind, and helpful. The best part of our experience. I gave the buffet 2 stars instead of 1 because of the service. 

Overall, I would not come back nor would I recommend it. There are many more buffets and\/or restaurants on the strip that I would rather eat at. I am glad I tried it just to say I tried it. Part of trying something or somewhere new is sometimes you hit it and other times you miss it. This my friends was a big fat miss.",1,1,1

ALASKAN KING CRAB

I could barely contain myself. There were a few people in front of me who were taking their sweet time picking up those deliciously huge crab legs and I gave them my evilest eye. Finally, I had made it to the front and started to pile my plate with crab legs. 

It was glorious. The crab legs were already cracked in half for you, so you didn't have to work to get your crab meat. It was instant gratification that I had never felt while eating crab. I really liked it. The huge downside were that the legs were cold, but you can't always win.

I calculated that around my 3rd plate of crabs, that I was near getting my money's worth. So, I decided to venture off and try some of the other items. The prime rib was dry and the chicken wellington really didn't impress me. I went back to the crab legs.

I've had all meals here before - breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. And I love it all. For the quality, price and selection, you really can't beat Bellagio. Highlights for me include:

- The best creamy just slightly runny scrambled eggs
- Cute petite jars of marmalade 
- Alaskan king crab legs (yes yes, most places do have this, but still good)
- Chilean Sea Bass (endangered but delicious)
- Sushi bar, made to order
- Steak tar tar, again made fresh to order
- Dessert Bar
- Bread Bar

This latest trip I got to try some Ostrich and Buffalo meat too. While not something I would particularly crave again, it was nice to be able to try.

Bellagio is always my go-to buffet. It's my one meal a day in sin city. 

Tip: Come around 3:30p so you can enjoy ""Linner"" at lunch prices. And skip the lines if you stay at the hotel as a guest. Otherwise, come early or else be prepared to wait in an hour + line.",3,0,1

True, this place isn't as fancy as Wicked Spoon, but I'd say the food at the Bellagio is superior. There were so many different things to choose from, and almost everything I tried was tasty rather than just a few things. Some of the things I enjoyed included the prime rib, all of the pasta dishes, the super yummy mashed potatoes, the even yummier pesto mashed potatoes, and the creme brûlée.

It had been about fifteen years since I'd visited the Bellagio buffet, and I read the reviews saying it has gone downhill. My last two visits to a more expensive buffet were to Bacchanal and I was so underwhelmed with the grumpy service and lukewarm, mediocre food that Bellagio was top of the list this visit.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the employees either like their jobs or tolerate them enough to be pleasant.  That's a huge plus in my book because so many service workers in and around Vegas HATE their jobs and it shows. Our waiter was engaging and even acknowledged our daughter.  Drinks were always full. The food was hit and miss in terms of greatness (but all of it was at least good), my favorite being the Kobe beef with au jus and sautéed button mushrooms (YUMMO).  The pastas were pleasant and the selection was unique.  I had a nice, crisp salad to start the meal.  My husband had some glazed carrots that we both thought were delicious. The fruit selection was nice, too. Husband says the crab legs were good and the shrimp very tasty. Prime rib was wonderful as well. Standard fare like turkey and mashed potatoes were tasty, and I appreciate that the mashed potatoes weren't watered down.  We brought our four year old daughter and she found plenty to eat (salami, cheese, fruit, etc...and even some of my Kobe beef) so it's definitely a place you can bring most kids.  The dessert bar, while not as magnificent as the *other* place, is better.  We tried an array of things from the little fruit tarts to the chocolate mousse and even the tiny donuts and everything was better than I expected.

They offered 3 types of caviar with an array of toppings; I had mine with a little chopped egg; again I was not disappointed.

My final venture was the desserts. I tried the pumpkin pie tart and the lemon merengue tart. They were the perfect end to a very satisfying meal.

I didn't eat any bread product (other than bread pudding which was yum) or rice bc I wanted to eat the out of ordinary stuff lol

My DB wanted our last hit of our Vegas trip to be the Bellagio Buffet for brunch. I was prepared to pay something like $16.99, but I guess it was a Labor Day special and it was also Saturday, so the per head cost was $29.99 without the champagne.  So we were a little sticker shocked.  We were in line quarter to 11A and there was a hardly a wait - thank god! 

While we were being seated, I remember thinking ""How the hell am I going to eat $29.99 worth of breakfast items?!""  Well thank god for their prime rib, cuz it was SO DARN DELICIOUS! I really don't expect a prime rib to be that yummilicious from a buffet, but I was really really impressed!! The portion they cut out  were very generous, that I looked a little surprised when the carver said ""Is that enough?""  Let's just say, I went back for seconds.  If there was room in my belly, I would've gone back for more.   I thought the sushi was good and fresh, nothing special about it was they were just the california roll types.

I did notice there weren't that many vegetable options....wish they had more veggie, like roasted veggies to go with my prime rib.  So less half a star for that.  

I would've given Bellagio Brunch Buffet  5 stars, but I was a little disappointed with their desserts and believe me, I took a plate of each one except for the chocolate cake!   The cheesecake and the key lime pie were too soft for me, as if they were sitting out too long. I like them a little solid, but not rock hard and definitely not mushy.  Not to mention, I was sad they didn't have any chocolate chip cookies without nuts.  boooo I could've used one too! There was only one dessert I liked and it was some puff pastry\/wafer  thingy with creme.  

So that's why I'd give them 3.5 stars. 1 star for the desserts and less 1\/2 for the lack of yummy grilled  veggies. (Did I just miss them? I wonder)

Moving on... My boyfriend is not a fan of buffets, but hearing that their Gourmet Dinner has Kobe beef, he was willing to try. The steak was very good for buffet standards (although for $40 you'd expect them to be good), you can choose medium rare or well-done, we had the medium rare and it was tender and juicy. The lamb was good too, but the taste is very strong, I was overwhelmed by the second slice. They also serve regular steaks and wellingtons.

The Mac & Cheese is AWFUL, totally tasteless. I tried a few pieces of each of their pastas and none of them tasted memorable. I went around a whole circle of the place and took a spoonful of most of the dishes they were serving and nothing really stood out to me (other than the various steaks).

Now, we must talk about desserts. Why? Because I love them, if you don't, you can skip ahead.
Cheesecake - oh so very good. It melts in your mouth and the flavor is so rich but at the same time it isn't overwhelming at all. Must try!
Carrot cake - standard, flavorful and not too much icing.
Tarts - there are various different tarts but I didn't quite like them. The Lime Tart is super sour.
Tiramisu - it tasted more like coffee mousse to me, but it's not bad.
Chocolate cake - very good! The chocolate flavor is very rich.
Caramel Pudding - the pudding was lacking taste, the caramel sauce couldn't really save it either.

All in all, I'm not sure we'd go back when we visit Vegas again (mainly due to the unimaginably long lines), but if you're a steak and dessert lover, this is a good place to go!",0,0,0

I don't want to look at Tile that looks like it belongs in some Metro Station or upscale Basement.  I want Wow, and it shouldn't be too much to ask to make the atmosphere in the Buffet ""match"" the Lobby or the Conservatory.  To me, it feels out of place. 2)  Come on Food and Beverage, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out how to make eggs out of a carton.  I think you just pour in the mix with some liquid and stir.  I didn't feel like standing in line for ""made to order"" eggs, so I just scooped out some ""Scrambled"" eggs.  You know, I didn't pay over $68 for breakfast to drink my eggs.  Ugh.

The place is rammed with Americans who are ramming their faces with cheap fizz and ""International"" cuisine. It's OK. Just about. Wide selection. Free for all. Some things are good, some things are not so good. Presentation leaves a lot to be desired.

I purchased one lunch pass and used a comp through myvegas card for the second pass. The cashier rang it up as two transactions. The first through the myvegas pass and the second on my credit card.

Once seated, our server took our drink order and looked at my receipts. She then claimed that I had only paid for one person and needed to buy another pass. I pointed out that I used a comp for one person and paid using my credit card for the second, hence the reason why I received two receipts.  She then instructed us to stay seated until she got someone else to look at it.

A few minutes later, our server brought who I assume was a supervisor that said the same thing. I repeated the same story and pointed out our cashier and told them to ask her. The supervisor then asked if she could see our comp ticket to prove my story. At this point, I was getting visibly frustrated since it could've been easily solved if they walked 30ft to ask the cashier. I told them my comp ticket was taken by the cashier but I had two receipts each showing a pass for each person.

Eventually, they brought over the manager to the table. He asked what the problem was and the server told him that I only bought one pass. Before, I could get a word in, he told the server that he saw me use a comp and buy another pass for my girlfriend.  He then showed the waiter how on one receipt it showed comp and other where I paid.   Without apologizing, the waiter finally said we could get our food while she got us waters.  Later on, the supervisor came back and asked if we had bought another pass. Luckily, the manager was within earshot and told her everything was fine with our table.

At that point, we had completely lost our appetites.  A small error made by the server could've been really resolved if she read our receipts properly or checked with the cashier. Instead, neither the waiter or supervisor did this and we were accused twice of only paying for one person.  Our dining service was fine after that. She attempted to overcompensate by asking us if our table was too wobbly or if she could bring us additional silverware.  Not much would've to made up the experience to us at that point.

We didn't seem to be the only table to be having issues as another table a few rows over was accused of the same thing by a different waiter.  The same supervisor came over and told them that they had to vacate their seats. This table had already gotten their food and are forced to get up holding their plates and try to resolve the situation.  The entire group was visibly upset as a couple of them went back to their cashier to get her to resolve the problem. The same manager resolved the situation quickly but at this point their table was given to another party.  So a group of four people stood at the front of the buffet, each carrying a full plate of food, waited until another table opened up.

How was the food? I don't know. You could've feed me gruel and I wouldn't have been able to tell a difference.

My family and I came on a Sunday night for dinner ($29.95 pp)...not bad considering the prices on a Friday and Saturday night. I had been researching different buffets on the strip on a Sunday and this one was about $5 more then others. There was a line, and we were thinking of skipping the buffet because we needed to catch a show, but the line actually moved relatively fast and we were seated maybe less than 30 minutes later (there was 12 of us so we had to wait while the tables were set up).

The food: Tasty! Good array of meats (prime rib!) pasta, pizzas, sushi, seafood, salads and of course...dessert! Everything was fresh too. I can't remember all the details about every single dish that I ate, but most of it was pretty good. Although the one thing I noted was that the Kobe beef was cooked way too rare. It was just too bloody so I couldn't finish it all. The crab legs were abundant but served cold. You can have the kitchen staff warm them up for you. You just need to ask them. 

I didn't find the dessert section that impressive though. There were the usual cakes. I saw bread pudding, flan and creme brulee. I think there was also a machine for soft serve ice cream? The creme brulee was delicious. We got it nice and hot. Love!

Also, the food was constantly being refilled. The staff is totally on top of their game! I never saw anything empty. As for our waiter, he was ok. I don't think he was too attentive and we had to ask for a lot of things. Gratuity was already tacked onto our bill because we had such a large party.

The food.  The glorious glorious food is basically a myriad of carbohydrates and starch and protein matching in complexity the taste of just about every carnal adventures you've experienced in your mouth. Hands down nothing beats the Bellagio in quality except maybe the Wynn. Between the Wynn and Bellagio are a close give and take in competition.

No, not DAYdreams about buffets like every other Asian girl. I mean dreams, in my sleep, about buffets. My good dreams consist of me actually getting to eat the food I picked out. The nightmares mean I dream about being stressed out because I don't know what else to put on my plate, it just gets filled up more and more until BOOM!! I wake up. Forreals.

I don't know if my taste has become more refined (doubtful) but I wasn't in love with the Vegas buffets this time around. I remember them as being so much better 2 years ago.. but they were mediocre. At least the Bellagio redeemed my Vegas buffet expectations I'd become used to fulfilling.

We waited in line for over half an hour for the dinner buffet on a Saturday night. It zig zagged up, down, and around until we finally got to the front. You've got to keep your eye on the prize here! Stay hydrated, keep good company, and make sure your phone's battery is charged for playing some time-wasting games.

So there were a few things that were just meh like the sushi and some of the chicken stuff. And I kind of expected more from the dessert spread. They looked pretty but I was expecting more.. bigger.. sparklier! With more chocolate! 

Now, the three things I could've filled my plate with, endless times over, were the short ribs, asparagus, and Yorkshire pudding. The short ribs were so creamy and succulent, the asparagus.. well I love asparagus. And who doesn't love Yorkshire pudding?! A savory pastry shell?! 

The inside of the Bellagio buffet is pretty refined, given it's a buffet. We saw plenty of families and groups of bachelor \/ bachelorette parties dining. One note to the girls: don't dress up to the buffet. It is Bellagio, yes, but it's still a buffet, not a fancy restaurant. Besides, how can you expand your tummy if you're wearing a non-expandable dress?! I saw some girls that looked like they were going out for the night and it looked silly, out of place.

Mmmm just thinking about that buffet makes me believe wasting all that money on those crap buffets was worth it. Worth the hefty price tag (do you know what $30 something could get you in NY?! A pizza and bottle of water), worth the 30 minute wait, and worth walking all the way down the strip from the Palazzo (it's far, seriously!) and back. WORTH IT.",7,5,8

So that means its either the Wynn or the Bellagio. The past few times this situation presented itself, my friends all decided on the Wynn. This time around, this particular group of friends let me decide. ""Well, the past few times its been the Wynn, so lets mix it up and try the Bellagio."", I suggested. ""I mean how bad can it be?""

We stroll up to the buffet on a Monday at around 7:30 and was pleasantly surprised not to see a line. Now in hindsight, is that a good thing or bad thing? Anyways, my friends bought my dinner so I didn't catch the price. I figure it was close to about $30. The nice hostess leads our party of five to a table that normally seats 4. She pulls an extra chair and puts it at the head of the table. Seriously? I can understand if we had a kid in the party, but we are all adults. Cant we all have our own little space?

""Excuse me miss, can we get another table?""
""Sure, this way please.""

So I was expecting they would bring us to a table that seats 6 and have an extra chair open. I guess thats what I get for assuming. She leads us to another table that seats four and pulls up an extra chair. Wow. This must be the five diamond\/5 star service I was expecting. I can understand if the place was packed but it seemed like 1\/3 of the tables were empty. Whatever. We deal with it and head for the food.

We grab a plate and walk the selections to see what delicious offerings they have. Dish after dish I didnt see anything I was too excited about. Everything just seemed normal. If they blindfolded me and brought me here, I would of guessed we were at a $12.99 buffet somewhere. I think I would of been happier eating at the Planet Hollywood buffet and saving a few bucks for gambling or drinks afterwards.

So for our first round, I start out with crab legs, peeled shrimp, cold smoked salmon, salmon sashimi, and some spicy tuna sashimi. Maybe it was my high expectations, but I didnt enjoy the food as much as I thought I would. The crab legs dipped in the warm butter was fine. Not spectacular. The peeled jumbo shrimp tasted like the ones I bought from the Albertsons seafood counter. Normal. The smoked salmon tasted fine. The salmon sashimi was decent. Now here's my gripe about the 1st plate. Spicy tuna sashimi... I couldnt even get past two bites. It was soooooo spicy. Are they trying to cover up the lack of taste? Seriously?

For the 2nd plate, I chose a slice of shrimp pesto pizza, rare prime rib, duck leg in peanut sauce, calamari salad, and scallop ceviche. I love duck. So the duck leg was yummy. The prime rib was good because I asked for a rare slice and the carving station guy pulled a whole prime rib slab and cut me a piece straight from the middle. It was worth it.  The pizza was ok as well as the calamari salad and scallop ceviche.

So far I enjoyed 3 out of 10 dishes. I take another lap and didnt really see anything else I wanted to eat. So I head for the massive dessert area to fill the void I was feeling. I select the carrot cake, flan, creme brulee, and a chocolate covered brownie. The best one was the carrot cake. Wow. That was very tasty. Possibly the best thing I tasted all night. The flan and creme brulee were delicious as well. the chocolate covered brownie I could have done without.

Here's another thing that bothered me. I ordered some tea. They had a great selection of about 5 or 6 teas. That's a good sign. I ordered some Green Tea and my friend orders some Earl Grey. While we wait for our beverages, she mentions that she should of asked for some lemon and honey for her tea. ""Those always come with the tea."", I confidently stated. Boy was I wrong again. I'm not doing well on assumptions tonight. They bring the tea and of course there's NO lemon or honey. Cmon now. Even at a lowly 24 hour cafe\/diner they bring you lemon and honey with an order of tea. Seriously.... SERIOUSLY?

Throughout this whole evening, the only thing that kept running through my mind was... How come I didn't choose the Wynn buffet? What else could go wrong? I had one too many drinks so I had to use the little boys room. When I walk in, there were about 5 guys in line waiting to use the urinals. Seriously.... There are two urinals and one regular toilet stall IN A BUFFET? SERIOUSLY? Now I know how the ladies feel.... Waiting.... Waiting....

Would I go back? Not anytime soon. Wynn or Bellagio Buffet? WYNN. Hands down. The food just tastes better there. You can truly taste the quality there. Do you have any pictures Leo? SURE DO! Check them out!

Less then $40 (including tax and tip!) per person gets you a high quality meal with endless options.

Favourites:
*KOBE BEEF!
*house-made sausage
*French macarons for dessert.

The Kobe beef alone is worth the price of admission.  It is listed as Kobe but even if it is actually American-bred Wagyu beef (a common trick) it is still a value as even Wagyu is high priced at most restaurants.  No fussy sauces or spices, just salt and pepper on the roasted meat, let the flavour of the beef shine.

The house-made sausages are grilled with peppers and onions to enhance their flavour but I like them alone.  They offered sweet and spicy versions on the night I went and both were delicious.

French macarons are one of those simple-looking pastries that are actually quite difficult to execute perfectly.  All the desserts were high quality but the macarons stood out to me.  These was pâtisserie quality macarons with the perfect amount of slight chewiness to the bite and no crumbling whatsoever.  Only strawberry was offered but they were perfect and would have been at least $2-$2.50 EACH at a French cafe.

This is a must stop for those Vegas buffet-lovers out there.  The only other buffet at this level is at the Wynn but theirs is slightly more expensive.",1,0,0

apparently i still have to try the buffet at the wynn...

i waited in line for about forty five minutes which isnt bad considering how long i wouldve had to wait for the wynn champagne brunch buffet...

our waitress was very nice...we're given two forks, two knives and a spoon each...

alaskan king crab, smoked salmon, beef wellington, pesto mashed potatoes, pesto spaetzle, shrimp, all different kinds of sushi (but they give too much rice. and i saw that a machine prepares the rice), shrimp pesto pizza, salmon roulade tarts, ribs, rack of lamb, lobster ravioli, creme brule, lobster dumplings, baked macaroni and cheese and beef tartar...thats just a summary of what i could remember...but they have twice as much and more to go with that...i had steak the night before so i didnt go near that...

so yeah...worth the money...their dessert display is pretty crazy...for my first buffet in vegas, this was great...im not giving it a five because i just dont like buffets in general...except for a few special gems that i know about...but despite all the losing of your money vegas, this one is a winner every time...that is, every time you decide to wait in line for God only knows how long and then dish out $40 over and over again...

The French toast with hazelnut chocolate and bananas is pretty bomb.  Got it in my first round, came back for seconds and got the very last one (they weren't making anymore).  I'm in love with it.  

I'm also a fan of their spicy tuna hand rolls and the fruit tart for dessert.

I was honestly a bit disappointed!  We visited for a late lunch\/early dinner on a Friday.

The service was fine, but not overly fantastic.  The dining room was nice, but lacked real atmosphere or character.

Granted, I am allergic to seafood and therefore didn't enjoy the plentiful crab.  But, my husband and his family felt they had better crab legs at other buffets.  The Kobi Steak was a big disappointment as it was chewy and lacked flavor.  Overall, the food was ok, but there weren't any dishes to write home about.  I found other buffets for the price that I enjoyed a lot more!  One highlight was the banana and nutella stuffed french toast!  It was the perfect sweet entree and one I've since replicated at home because my husband and I loved it so much.

A side note:  The best game plan to get the best food at the best prices is to go near the end of the lunch shift (which is usually between 3:00 & 4:00).  They don't clear out the restaurant between lunch and dinner shifts and the prices are usually significantly cheaper for lunch (like $12 less a person!)  For example, we went to the Bellagio at 3:30, paid the lunch price, but then they bring out the dinner entrees starting at 4:00.

UPDATE 10-10-11 :  I'll rewrite this when I have time but since the Wynn Buffet quit serving King Crab Legs I switched back to the Bellagio.  I have to say it has been excellent again.  The big thing before was they were so slow in changeover from lunch to dinner and now management gets it right out on time.  I was very impressed.  They must have got new management as it is now back to the quality I was used to.

OLD REVIEW:

I am a veteran at eating at the Bellagio Buffet and used to feel it was the best buffet in Vegas.  I have been eating there about 30 times a year since the Bellagio opened.   I felt it was the best back when Steve Wynn opened the joint.  The crab legs used to be giantic and everyhting was super high end.  It declined some over the years but was still great.  I went there yesterday to celebrate a friends birthday and have to say it was a huge disappointment.  Even a great restaurant can sometimes serve a bad meal, a steak too tough, or a dish just not prepared the way it should have been.  That was not the case on this night..  The buffet has just cut way back on the variety and the quality of what it offers.  The reason I have enjoyed this buffet so much in the past is that they always served my favorite items with high quality.  I go there on Friday night which is supposed to be their extra special gourmet buffet..which they charge additional $$$$$ for over other nights.  So I had to pay additional to eat on this night but actually found they weren't even serving most of my favorite dishes.  I am a King Crab junkie.  Although they did have some king crab leg scraps they were serving this day, they had to be the the smallest, most disappointing, dried out, tastless crab legs ever served up in Las Vegas.  My buddy kept saying they had to be some sort of illegal catch because the size was so small.  My other favorite item is the lamb chops.  Last time I ate at the buffet during the week..and they weren't serving the lamb chops..I inquired and the chef told me they have them on the Friday Gourmet nights.  So I was excited for that but on this day they skipped serving them.  Big disappointment.  My third favorite item is the sea bass and they weren't serving that this night either.  My buddy really enjoys unique meats like ostrich, buffalo, etc. and none of those meats were in the mix tonight either.  So not only were they missing all of my favorites..they didn't even serve anything special as alternatives.  To top things off my favorite dessert is the napoleons and they ran out before I was able get any.  It seems like the bufett was a winner every time until the past 6 months or so and it has steadily declined.",1,0,1

I have to admit, I did enjoy the Bellagio Breakfast Buffet. We came for a late breakfast\/brunch (around 10:45), so we got to try the breakfast & lunch foods! They had pretty much every breakfast food you could think of & you could get omelets made for you. The fruit was extremely fresh & they even had watermelon aqua fresca. I loved the desserts that they started putting out around noon, they had carrot cake, lemon meringue, brownies, chocolate cake, éclairs & many other delicious looking desserts.

They should've had two chefs there instead of one doing both. 

We ended up feeling rushed and stressed, which is disappointing after paying $55 apiece for a meal. (And we didn't have time to change before our show, which put a damper on the evening.)

One thing people seem impressed by though are the crab legs, and I found that those were too frozen and difficult to eat.  But other than that, no complaints.  And the desserts!  Oh...

But like I said, be careful!  You may feel like there are so many things to eat and goddamnit if you're not going to get your money's worth, but the crippling fullness can hurt.  I will never forget sitting curled up and moaning on the seat of a slot machine, on the point of bursting and unable to move.  Curse you Bellagio!",2,2,3

Here are my takeaways. 

-The Bellagio offers really great service for a buffet. I was part of a rambunctious party of 16, and we constantly had waitresses stopping by, refilling our drinks (when they say bottomless champagne\/mimosas, they really mean it), chatting amiably with us, and taking away finished plates. 

-The buffet has the most ripe, delectable fruit ever! Juicy white peaches, perfectly shaped pears... The Bellagio's attention to detail and fruit-ripeness is noteworthy. 

-I don't remember everything I ate (it was a long weekend) but I do recall eating tons of bacon. And let me tell you, it was good. Definitely get the bacon. 

-Most items are cooked surprisingly well for being produced en masse. There is a lot of fresh seafood- I had well-prepared sushi, a variety of smoked fish, shrimp cocktail by the pounds, and squid & octopus ceviche. The pastries were not a crowning point (in fact, existed only a notch above severely underwhelming... pallid tart & pie crusts are not my thing), but the fresh bread was killer.

-Everyone keeps taking & posting pictures of macarons. I saw none on my visit :( and thus had to buy some separately at Jean-Phillipe. HUGE BUMMER. MINUS ONE STAR. (Kidding. But honestly, only slightly.) 

In the end, buffets are buffets. When gauging your own hedonistic binging experience, the only two questions you should ask yourself are ""Was this good for buffet food or bad for buffet food?"" and ""Did I recover at least half my money through my mouth?""

If the answers are ""good"" and ""yes"", then you've won the buffet. And that is exactly how I felt dining at the Bellagio.",5,6,4

For the food - average at best. Meat selections were overloaded with sauce and dry. Pasta selections were overloaded with sauce. Stayed away from the shrimp (looked loaded with iodine) and crab. The pizza was the only good item. 

The desserts were generally tasteless. I tried almost all of them as the 4 people at my table each got an assortment. 

Odd thing about seating.... as we were leaving Mariana was happy to seat a group of 10 at a table... she seemed to know them well.

Sounds very vegas right?

Bellagio buffet is that way.

We went to this place during my friend's bachelor party for dinner at 8pm

We were greeted by a line of over 200 people.   The wait was probably 45 minutes.  It gave me time to catch up w\/a lot of my friends from High School while in line.   

I was ALSO reminded why I don't talk to many of them as much anymore.

They would only talk about iphones, anime, and video games...
hmmm...by the 2nd row of the line..it got old REALLY fast.

I ended up talking to other people in line and had a better time!

We finally were seated to this spacious table for 10 and took off to the buffett.

Steaks, sirloin, crablegs, salds of all kinds, korean\/chinese\/japanese food etc.  

For a person who's kind of a hoarder(me)..this place is dangerous.

I wanted to try EVERYTHING.  But I knew that I would pay the price if I did.  Oh well..I was only here two days.  Might as well do it.

I had a piece of every food..and then some.
So did all of my anime friends.

*sigh*

Have you ever experienced...Meat OVERKILL?

We did..right around the 3rd or 4th plate.

I dunno HOW those competitive eaters get through these buffet sessions..it probably doesn't phase them!

The quality of the food was better than average and that's all you can really expect at a no holds barred cafe.   YOu cannot expect 4-5 star food at a buffet.  NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

But if you like pretty decent food and lots of it...Bellagio Buffet is the best of vegas.   Although some would argue that Wynn and the Venetian are better.  I'll have to see.

For the meat\/and entrees..it's 4-5 stars.   I gave it 3 stars because the desserts were not up to par for me.   Most had very little or no flavor and were over sugared.   

IF they can step up their dessert game then I think they have the best in vegas hands down.

I don't have much commentary on the patrons..except..most looked overgambled, very heavy and the girls that were hot looked very worn down and overdyed(hair).   

So typical vegas crowd.

Indulge till you get sick!

btw..I didn't eat meat for 3 weeks after this",1,2,3

Sweet potatoes : AWESOME. Sushi: Rice was horrible, shrimp tempura was OLD and way too salty. Char sui: BLAND , tasteless and I spit it out. Salads: Fresh and very good. Cous cous: too salty and blah. Shrimp cocktail: Hard to screw up defrosting shrimp so ,not bad. Roast: Overcooked and tasteless.cucumber salad at sushi bar: Tasty but OLD.Beef bourguignon: carrots undercooked, and HEAVY oregano taste. Yuck. Smoked trout: Good. Salmon: Absolutely tasteless.....! Manicotti: NO flavor... bland pasty with NO flavor in tomato sauce.... again I threw it all out. I tried teh butternut squash with cinnamon: It tasted like someone microwaved it and didn't even finish the job: TASTELESS and undercooked... anyway, on top of all of this, the smoke from the Casino,  gets sucked into the entire buffet area. I have asthma so this was awful. I asked the manager how it could smell like smoke. She explained the place acted like a vacuum. It pulled all the smoke into the buffet... OMG.. anyway, the line was also 30 minutes. We will NEVER go back. I asked for a refund from my hotel it was so bad. I have never done that before. My husband is sick and laying next to me  because of the food. guess it was good I barely ate. Plus it was more expensive than MGM. My advice: If you want a decent buffet, go to the MGM.",1,0,0

Sad to report that they'll be kept as memories as their current menu is disappointing. I came here during Monday, Memorial Day, and the menu was brunch themed, $35.99 or $53.99 for unlimited champagne.  I didn't mind,  who doesn't love a good brunch with bottomless mimosa? 

Let's start with the quality of food, it had depreciated. Their prime rib fried rice had little to none meat.  The craving station had a selection of prime rib (loved that we can cook it medium vs medium rare), honey glazed ham, and home made sausages. All basic meats.  As for their seafood, thawed snow crab legs, smoked salmon, and cocktail shrimps. They did have a sushi making station so I suppose you can accredit it as part of the seafood selection but it was lack luster. 

Being a bruch themed,  they had the typical pancakes,  mini waffles,  oatmeal, grits, etc. These all fall short of standards as well as the hollandaise sauce on the egg Benedict was flavorless.  

I will not revisit Bellagio's buffet again as the quality of the food does not match up to their price.",5,0,2

No! The line is extremely long and the staff is rude as hell.  We were in line maybe 830 and didnt get in until around 930. The person yelled out that the place will close at 1030 and food be taken away. No refunds! Wow....

So when we got into eat finally, I expect this place to look beautiful. Nope. It really look like your average buffet in your hometown.  We sat down and our waiter is an old Asian man who really shouldnt be working in a fast pace enviornment like that. We are Asian too sonof course we tried to be nice....but he wasnt having it. Our plates were piling up and our drinks were not filled.  I felt bad for this other young waiter who had to wait for our table because this man did not want to help us.  

Our waiter was so bad, I saw the manager come over to him and yell at him to clean our table and get our drinks.  When he finally came over and forced to ask us if we are doing okay!   We said fine ( not really) and told him what drinks we wanted.  He never came back and the young waiter did it for us.  I saw him yell at our older waiter later...

So...that isnt all! My friend was getting some food and thia time their cook staff was hastily throwing food away even though a lot of people were there eating.  One guy dumped a whole tray of old food into the trash right in front of my friend and she was splashed with the dirty food! We all complained to the manager.  She didnt seem to care.  She said she only can talk to the waiters\/ people in her department.  The cooks are separate.  Well we said if she can talk to their manager.  She said she would...and that was it.  She didnt seem like she cared and I am sure the issue was not addressed.

I really enjoyed going to the Ballagio but after eating here I feel like Ballagio isnt that reat anymore.  This Buffet really need to have a lesson in customer service and find our ways to treat their pyayimg customers better",3,1,0

The scrambled eggs in the buffet were very runny but the omelet man was able to cook up some fresh ones that were well done.  The server was busy of course but pretty attentive and easy to get a hold of for more drinks and champagne. Can't go wrong with a champagne brunch!

Overall, it's decently good.  The selection of food is very good.  There are also a plethora of fancy stuff, like tuna pokes and caviar.  We tried the Kobe beef but it didn't feel special, but it was fancy stuff nonetheless.  The crab legs were good and large and they always resupplied it quickly.  There weren't as many different desserts as there were in Wicked Spoon but the quality is higher at Bellagio.

The restaurant is very cafeteria like which was a bit of a turn off but let me move on to the food.

Great selection. If I was craving for anything they would have definitely had it at the buffet. Seafood, sushi, Italian, Greek, meat, bread, Chinese, sweets, cheeses, eggs, the list goes on and on.

While there are certain items that are better at other buffets (Like the Wynn's Gelato station and salads or the Paris' massive dessert section...macaroons, creme brulee... wow), I would still pick the Bellagio buffet because of its entrees.  After all, the entrees are usually what I look forward to the most, rather than the appetizers & desserts.

We got there at 4:00, which was a shame because we could've come 30 min earlier to get the lunch price -- Oh well!  We definitely ate over $36 of food anyway, so it was well worth it.  We waited in line on Saturday evening for only 20-30 minutes around that time because we were tired \/ starving from Tao Beach.  We just wanted to veg out!  We got seated quickly and had our orders taken for drinks in a jiffy!  

Swordfish, Quail, King Crab, Snow Crab, TUNA POKE... oh my god.  Is this real life?  I heard the Beef Wellington was quite good, but I'm not really a red meat \/ beef \/ pork kind of person, so I didn't try it as I did not want to waste any precious space in my stomach!  

My point is -- you have to try it.  Of course it's expensive, but it's up to you to make it worth it!  The first two times I came to Vegas, I either went to a shitty buffet (Imperial Palace, which is worse than Fresh Choice \/ Souplantation), or I did not go to any buffet at all, which I greatly regret!  Normal food in Vegas (not fast food) is expensive anyway, so I'd rather indulge a bit for a REAL meal.

We were in Vegas last week and one of the stops we HAD to make was the buffet. Bellagio or Wynn? We decided to eat the buffet at Bellagio since we were at the hotel. We came in at 2:30pm and did not leave until after 5pm. Paid for lunch ($21something with tax) and stayed for dinner. It was awesome!!!!!!!! I love it! So many good food, so little stomach. 

Their bread pudding was the bomb!!! It was HELLA good esp when you eat it with ice cream. My friend told me not to eat it because it's a filler (carb) but I couldn't stop...it was really really really good! Their prime rib and crab leg and baked salmon sashimi and tuna roll and roasted chicken (i asked for a slice and the guy cut me HALF a chicken. DAMN) and the cocktail shrimps (super fresh) and all the pasta and gourmet desserts...OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG DROOL!!! I want to go back now! YUMM!

Some tips: come in around 3pm (2:30 was too early...we were full before dinner menu came out and had to stuff our faces for the prime rib and crab leg). If you come around 3pm-ish, then you can pace yourself before dinner menu comes out. Dinner starts at 4pm. skip all the ""sugar-free"" desserts.

It's definitely a splurge for us as they never have 2:1 coupons which we like to use at other casino buffet's.  We were able to apply from mLife credit which helped a little.

With that, this last time we were there on 12\/28 for brunch, we had the best server!  She gave us tips on how to get the crab legs steamed (take them to the pizza counter and ask them) so they are nice and hot.  When I couldn't decide on a drink, she offered to just bring both!  

The food here is always top notch.  One thing I missed this time was gelato!  They replaced it with soft serve.  They get points for having raspberry and peach sorbet as well as well chocolate and vanilla.  But honestly, since you can get soft serve at any other buffet, that dings it one star.

The other plus from the meal was the omelet station. We went for an egg white only omelet that was exceptionally good; I regret not getting a second. Other than that, nothing particularly stood out.

I came to the Bellagio to try the buffet many years ago (I think around 1998 or 1999), and haven't gone back since. 
I don't know why it took so long for me to come back here, as I remembered when I did try it back in the late 90's, it was a pretty darn good buffet, with the exception of remembering that they served very small servings of food. 
Now don't worry gang.............it's a buffet, so you can keep coming back for more! I guess the small servings are a great idea, that way you get to try the various items that the buffet would offer.

It's year 2016, and all I can say is - ""I'm Baaaaaaaaaack!!!!"" 

I took my pops & cousin to the Bellagio so they could enjoy the wonderful buffet at the Bellagio! The quality of food is top notch, and the offerings & selections is huge!

Some of my favorites at this buffet is the Prime Rib & Mussels. 

They also had Kobe Beef, Turkey, & Ham too at the carving station. If you like pasta & pizza........they had that too. They also had a station where they served Asian themed food, like won ton soup, & Char Shu. 
Then there was seafood, like the cold crab, as well as fish, & mussels.

The desserts were to die for...........if you have a sweet tooth like me, you can kill your sweet addiction by visiting this dessert buffet! There are just too many things to mention here!

Service by the waiter, as well as the chef at the carving station was not the friendliest, but I'm not here to experience top notch service. I was here to throw down & EAT! 

But if you need to know about my service experience...........when I was seated, the table they placed us on was still dirty, as when I had put my cellular phone down on the table, there was some kind of sticky substance on the table, making my phone dirty. 
I told the waiter when he had time, if he could kindly clean up the table again........and I'm not sure if he got irritated about that? After that, while were were dining, not once did the waiter come by to check on us. When I ran out of hot tea, I had to flag down our waiter to get a refill.

On the bright side, at least the busboy was very quick to remove the dirty plates once we finished our meals, so at no time was the table left with stacked plates.

For $35.99 per person, the Buffet at the Bellagio is still a great bargain for the type of food they offer! Check 'em out gang! No can go wrong!!!",20,13,20

It used to be the best buffet in Vegas, but tonight we had dry salmon, hard-to-chew ""Kobe"" beef, overcooked prime rib, and sushi on undercooked balls of hard, unseasoned rice that came out of a machine. The sea bass was good (flavorful and tender) but you have to get the ones that are super-fresh right when they put out the pan - my husband got his piece when it had been sitting for a while, and mine was much better.

On weekend dinners they have a caviar bar and some kind of upgraded sushi offering, but neither of these were that good - I suppose it's a buffet so you don't expect it to be truly gourmet, but at least serve these items with the proper accoutrements. To be fair, the sushi fish was decent, and I asked for a plate of just the sashimi, but they said I had to take the lumpy, sloppily crafted nigiri off the serving plates and then I felt bad leaving the rice balls uneaten to be thrown away so I just moved on to something else. I mean, the rice had hard, crunchy grains in it. Yuck.

The best offerings (and the reason this isn't a one-star review) were the pesto shrimp pizza, beef ravioli in mushroom cream sauce, pesto tortellini, and the desserts. There was a delicious chocolate dome and yummy mango\/coconut panna cotta that was the perfect firmness and sweetness.

The one thing I'll say about the desserts is that it would have been great to have a more sophisticated ice cream and cookie offering. Other buffets have a large selection of hand-scooped gelato or sorbet in yummy flavours and things like macaroons. I can get choc\/vanilla soft serve and chocolate chip cookies at Soup Plantation, sorry.

Overall, it was convenient because we're staying at the Bellagio, and we were able to skip the humongous line because of our MLife card (if you don't have one, get one just for the VIP perks), but even with the less-than-$40 price, the value wasn't there.",1,1,2

It ended up being $48 total - $32 for the food and $15ish for AYCD. One of the things I really like about this buffet is they don't ""put the clock"" on you, so to speak. Lots of other places either enforce a hard 2-hour time limit on drinking or start not-so-subtly shoving you out the door around that time. I like to take my time, eat at least 3-4 plates, and enjoy my alcohol instead of just slamming stuff down. On my most recent visit this past Saturday, we were here for 3.5 hours. I was able to enjoy my food and mimosas so much more this way, and it felt much more relaxed for my admittedly hungover and slightly lethargic brain.

Wait time can get really, really bad, but at 11 am this past Saturday am, it was only a 20 minute wait. Admittedly, it is wintertime and therefore off season, so I'm sure this isn't always the case.

While their food isn't necessarily over-the-moon incredible like some of the other buffets, they have plenty of delicious if basic offerings. The omelette station was fun and line wasn't too long, the peppercorn-crusted meat offering was delicious although a little too rare for my taste, and the veggie covered pizza was awesome. They had a cheese ravioli in some sort of insane vodka sauce, which was my favorite I think, and their mountains of crab legs were a fun group bonding activity. Sorry to the gentleman I hit with part of a leg shell while cracking a particularly difficult leg. They also have a good amount of Asian-inspired offerings, including decent sushi and pork buns. Their desserts left a little to be desired; the macaroons were pretty but lacked much flavor; their cheesecake was underwhelming, and the pumpkin tart was also not the best. 

Our waitress was adorable, and in my experience the waitstaff here is always awesome. The coffee is delicious, and service was prompt to fill up the water, coffee, and mimosas. They also set down the OJ on your table and pour the champagne for you, letting you choose how much\/how little OJ you want in your drink. As someone who mostly just likes OJ ""for color"", I really like this perk.

Overall, recommend as the number-one buffet for a more chill, relaxed vibe for a leisurely brunch; if you want the wow-factor type food, I would recommend going elsewhere. Depends what you're looking for.",4,2,1

When I went last time, the fruits served were exotic ones like lychee and star fruit from overseas.  Now they serve oranges, watermelon, Melons.  okay.

We went back for another go round for Sunday Brunch last weekend. I must say the Bellagio Buffet redeemed themselves. The food was outstanding and I feel they must have made a few changes with regards to the buffet since the last time.

From the waffles, pancakes, bacon, sausage, eggs, potato hash (must try), to the prime rib, I felt that everything was delicious and gets my signature of approval. The dessert & pastries were no joke either.

For dinner, prime rib is awesome. I had to have 3 servings. The lamb is not as good but still worth trying. Most of their meats are always cooked well and the carvers serve generous portions.

Cocktail shrimp and salmon sushi are good. Sometimes, you have to watch when the fresh sushi comes out because it can sit there and become room temperature.

The chicken noodle soup is average. Probably one of the only negatives items.

On the breakfast side, bacon, eggs, and eggs benedict are great. The sausage is pretty good but I still prefer the bacon. Waffles are hard but they have a great variety of them that it offered good samples. Got there late during brunch as some breakfast was removed so can't say much more about breakfast.

Too many desserts to try - flan (if you like sweet caramel), ice cream. (Bread) pudding with some ice cream does the trick quite well. Grab some fresh fruit - strawberries, bananas, etc etc

Orange juice and lemonade tastes fresh and possibly home made and\/or freshly squeezed.

Service is better than normal buffet service as they are quick to clear off plates. 1st 2-3 rounds of beverages are fast but then things slow a bit.

After getting seated at a table and paying, you are greeted by a waiter that gives you drinks of all sorts.  Afterwards, the variety of food is wonderful.  From seafood to breakfast items to noodles to meat, nearly every item at the buffet seemed to have a great taste in mind behind it and was just a joy to eat.  The unlimited succulent shrimp was delicious and the bowtie noodles with fettuccine sauce and chicken were superb.  Add to that the banana hazelnut french toast and the great desserts (sugar-less cheescake was wonderful), I had a hard time leaving. 

Admittedly, the Asian cuisine was not up to par at all whether it was the oddly flavored shrimp spring rolls or the bland sushi and there was some other bland dishes, but the variety and the taste were great.

We ate there last night, 12\/19\/15, and were seated at 9pm and they close at 10pm.  While waiting in line I asked one of the host what time they stop cooking and he said 10:30pm so figured worth it since we'd have at least 1.5 hr to eat. Since it was 12\/19, they charged more, like $49.99\/pp and no child pricing even though we brought our son.

- unfriendly service from their food staff (except for our waitress) 
- the cioppino station says ""made to order"" so when I walked up I asked for made to order but the woman just served me a bowl from the already cooked pot, when I asked about it, she just replied, ""too busy, no time"" -- wtf, this is bellagio service?!!

- their holiday menu posted ""grilled lobster tails"" but no didn't see any, closest thing was crawfish
- like I said earlier, the host told me they stop cooking at 10:30pm but at 10pm the caviar station was already closed.  Tried to get some frozen yogurt from their machine but they already started draining the machine at 10pm

That being said that food is not much different than many other high end buffets offered on the strip for the exact same price, and certainly not more delicious or different enough to go back and undergo the same treatment. 

A group of 5 of us decided to have brunch there on Sunday. The line was incredibly long but we were not in a hurry and waited patiently for about 30-40 minutes. We were all on vacation, staying at the hotel, and this was our last opportunity to spend time together before we all left (to various cities\/states) later that evening. Each of us ordered the ""unlimited"" champagne option with the intention of eating, drinking, and hanging out for quite some time. 

At first our server was very helpful. He was friendly and was prompt to refill our waters, juice, and champagne. After we were there for a couple of hours he asked us if we needed anything else because he was getting ready to leave. This was obviously his cue that he wanted a tip but that was fine, most of us have worked in the service industry and he was polite about it. Two of us had tipped him on our credit card and another one of us at the table gave him $20 upon this cue. 

30 minutes or so passed and we were all running low on drinks and a new server had not been by to greet us. We spotted him walking by and asked him if he could refill our drinks or send whichever coworker was going to be taking over our table. At this point his personality had taken a complete 180 and he rudely explained that we drank too much and he wasn't going to provide anymore refills on the ""unlimited"" champagne. This was entirely untruthful and ridiculous for all of the following reasons:

1) We had been there for 3 hours at this point, yes we had been drinking semi-continuously during this time but we were also continuously eating. 
2) there were FIVE of us, obviously the amount of champagne the entire table consumed was going to be elevated vs. most tables of 2 or 3
3) Not once did anybody at the table show any signs of intoxication of the slightest bit. There was nothing spilled, dropped, no falling down, no impaired walking, no harsh words, absolutely no indication that a single person should not continue to be served. 
4) Just because you have already received your tip from a table that you may or may not have found to be adequate for the amount of time they were taking up space in your section is NEVER a valid reason to begin acting rude and uncooperative. 

We then asked to speak with the manager to demonstrate that everybody at the table was in a clear state of mind and express how unfair and unhappy we were with the treatment. She was of absolutely no help and then explained she could give us ""one more round, but that was it"" SO if the argument is that a table has drank far too much and can not be served anymore for ""legal purposes"" as we were told doesn't it seem a bit counter intuitive and just plain wrong to provide with them ""just one more drink"" Exactly. 

After all of this one of the girls at our table decided to go up to the bar to purchase her own drink and of course, they took her money and served her one. 

Yes there are probably people that take advantage of the ""unlimitedness"" of the buffet but isn't that the POINT?? We are not there every weekend doing this we were simply trying to get the most out of our last day there.  We were tipping well, spending money on Keno, and being extremely decent and respectful to everyone that worked there.

After hearing so much about the Bellagio Buffet, we added it to the list of our ""must-dos"" in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, it fell grossly short of our expectations. 

First of all, the buffet is overpriced. I mean paying $25 for lunch without alcoholic beverages is a lot. The buffet surely has variety, but the menu options are poorly thought out and executed haphazardly. The pastas that we tried had a pronounced garlic taste, which I hate. The pizzas were nothing extrordinary.. There were not many Asian options other than sushi.. The shrimp had no flavor to it. I tried a duck dish, where the meat was undercooked.. Similarly, it had very few non-red meat options. 

The service was average.. not too good not too bad.. 

To add to all this, the hour-long wait to actually get to the buffet was definitely not worth it... By the end, my husband and I started feeling that our bucks would have been better spent in some fine dining restaurant, wven if it meant that we pay a little more..

We did the old ""come for breakfast, stay for lunch trick"", so we only paid a fairly reasonable $16 (the weekday breakfast price), but even at this price we were quite disappointed.

BREAKFAST
The breakfast buffet was pretty standard breakfast food, nothing really unique.   There was a make-your-own-omelet station that we didn't try and the usual breakfast offerings of eggs, bacon, sausage, several kinds of potatoes, french toast, pancakes, waffles.   The pastry selection was miserable, and had just some extremely mediocre croissants and some passable but not outstanding muffins.    The french toast was probably the best thing I had, as it had some nice apple flling, but everything else was on the poor side of average, and there was just nothing unique or enticing at all.     They did start putting up some lunch stuff at 10:30 or so, even though it didn't officially start until 11, and some breakfast stuff even started disappearing around then, so if having breakfast is important to you, get there before 10 am.

LUNCH
We didn't stay until noon, when apparently the sushi comes out, but we weren't really in the mood for that anyone.   The lunch entrees were very limited in number, and I think I tried just about all of them.  There was some disgusting, oily pizza, some Chinese food that my boyfriend had, several fish entrees with the grossest, fishiest tasting fish I've had in a long time (clearly frozen), chicken coq au vin that I didn't try because it was made with pork (and props to them for making that clear), and a carving station with turkey, chicken, and lamb.  The turkey I had from there was extremely dry and tough.   There was also a nice-looking salad bar, with a make your own option, as well as a number of pre-made salads to choose from.  

DESSERT
The dessert selection was absolutely, hands-down the most disappointing part of the buffet.  The selection was so limited (chocolate brownies, a couple different kinds of cake, cheesecake, some fruit tarts, and tiramisu), but more than that the desserts were just GROSS - the kind you would find on a college cafeteria line, not an elegant buffet.   Everything was stale, congealed, and just plain unappetizing.   The best thing I had was probably a chocolate eclair that was filled with runny chocolate sauce.  It wasn't good, just edible to me because I love chocolate so much that anything with that much chocolate is edible.
Furthermore, the one dessert I was really looking forward to trying (chocolate covered strawberries) disappeared before I could get one.   They started putting desserts out around 10:30.  I saw a girl with a chocolate strawberry at 10:45, and immediately got up to grab one.  I saw the empty plate where they had been on, so I figured they would be replaced soon.   Nope.  I wanted for awhile and then finally gave up.  THen my boyfriend waited awhile, and then finally I asked the chef putting out the desserts and she said ""No more strawberries.""  WHAT?  For the day?   How can put out one plate of something and then no more of them, at a buffet.  Ridiculous.  All I wanted was one damn strawberry!!!!

Naturally, when we came back to Las Vegas this year we had to stop here for brunch.  What stood out most to us before was the large array of seafood they had.  When we arrived this time we came much earlier in the day and learned that those items were usually only served on holidays, but that there would be some available after 11am.  We spoke with Randy, the manager that morning, and he agreed to let us come back after 11 since we had just sat down.  It honestly made our day and left us knowing how devoted to good service the staff at the Bellagio are.  The food was delicious as always.  Our waitress this time was very polite and good, but our waiter last time, Humberto, was amazing.  He has a contagious smile, never let a mimosa glass go empty and just left you feeling happy.  Good food stands out, but for me, good service is really what you remember and you will definitely find both here.  Thank you Humberto and Randy.  You both rock!",0,0,0

My friends and I came for lunch around 2pm and stayed for dinner which started at 3pm. Basically, two meals for the price of one! Yes!  The total came out to be about $27 for lunch. We didn't even have to wait since we came for a late lunch on Monday. However, when we were leaving around 4pm, there was quite a long line for dinner. 

Once we got in, we were seated quite far from the all the food selections. But I guess it was a blessing in disguise since we needed exercise for all the food we were about to devour. 

We stayed for about 2-3 hours and sampled the majority of the items at the buffet. I skipped the bread and pasta selection since they were not worth it to me to try.  Some of my favorites from lunch\/dinner was the salmon and tuna poke, tuna hand roll, seared salmon, salmon nigiri, steak flank, bbq ribs, prime rib, ratatouille, and the various dessert options. I couldn't stop going back for seconds on the salmon and tuna poke. The fish was fresh and tasted amazing with the spicy mayo sauce that they had. The sushi selection was small and I didn't bother to try any besides the salmon\/tuna nigiri. Wish they had more selection of sushi. 

The choice of meat that they had were all delicious and I should have asked for smaller slices beforehand because the meat fills you up! They even made the bacon just how I like it- crispy but not burnt crispy.  

I was also loving the dessert section. You can choose from white chocolate nutella cone, mango coconut panna cotta, cheesecake, cannolis, frozen custard, flan, etc. 

For me, the only disappointment from the buffet was the crab legs. They were cold and definitely lacking in flavor.  I was expecting better crabs legs from this buffet. I did see families with piles of crab legs on their table, so I guess there were some people who did enjoy it.


Tip: Go towards the end of lunch around 2pm and stay for dinner! ;)",3,1,1

In my opinion, it's totally up to what your food preference is.

When I go to a buffet, I want a good variety of high quality tasty meats to choose from, a solid array of sides that compliment the meat, and my personal favorite dessert.  Bellagio fits the bill for me.

It does so with the juicy prime rib, perfectly cooked rack of lamb, subtle sweet crab legs, glutinous number of potato side dishes, a decent cheese assortment, and sweet caramel flan.  There's a good assortment of other foods for people who want more than this (i.e. the pastas, asian food, sushi, fish dishes, salad station, etc.), but i stick to what I like.

The service I received tonight was ""okay.""  I got my drinks refilled in a timely fashion, but plates were piling up and not being taken away too quickly.

But I don't come to buffets for the service, I come for the food.

Edit:
Editing this down to 4 stars because I went again on a non-weekend day, and the lack of rack of lamb, and less than stellar meat selections this time around made me leave a little disappointed.  I also called in advance to ask if they had ""rack of lamb"" and they said YES, but turns out it was leg of lamb!",0,0,0

On this trip we tried the one at Bellagio which has so often been compared to the one at The Wynn.  The buffet at Bellagio is pretty good, but The Wynn wins in my book.

They draw even in the PRIME RIB, SHRIMP and CRAB LEG categories, all of which were great...particularly the shrimp!  But if you refer back to my review of The Wynn, you'll note that I raved about the COOKED FISH being delicate and delicious.  I was not impressed at all with the fish at the Bellagio, which was overcooked and less flavorful overall.

Of the other items I tried, there were two kinds of MUSSELS -- one hot and cold.  Both were decent.  There were four different soups...you have to really look for them.  I tried the MISO, which I liked.  As usual I stayed away from the sushi, but decided to try the SALMON and AHI POKE because it looked surprisingly good and it was.

Dessert was mixed.  They offer some pretty-looking bites, but fall short of the dessert offerings at The Wynn.  I tried a couple of chocolate raspberry items.  The square-shaped layered mousse cake bite was mediocre.  The one in the cone was better.  I also tried their apple pie which was okay too.  But no waffle or crepe station like The Wynn.  Most disappointing is the ice cream which comes out of a machine here.  So far, the gelato at Cravings (Mirage) is the best in this department.

I liked my cranberry juice and my friend liked her iced tea and we both liked the coffee.  It was actually strong.

The elderly Asian lady working in our area was hustling the whole time we were there.  She rushed to bus the tables, bring out drinks, etc.  We were seated by the door that the workers kept going in and out of, and you know, they were all hustling.

Well, since I was in Vegas for CES for the week, my friends and I decided to try out a posh upscale buffet in one of the fancier hotels on the strip. Luckily we didn't wait long for our table, maybe about 15 minutes. We paid, made our way to our table, ordered drinks and then I entered nirvana. The quality of food, the quantity of food was mind boggling. I made an effort to try all the entrees but being a newb in buffets I failed. I didn't get to try all but what I had was excellent for a buffet. The prime rib, Top New York Sirloin, roast chicken, hot sausages were amazing. They had sea bass, smoked trout, king crab legs and snow crabs which were excellent as well. 

Their sushi bar was always stocked with typical rolls of tuna and salmon. Those less adventurous, the California rolls did not disappoint. I had steak tartar for the first time and it was heavenly. Or could have been hell if they didn't prepare it well. But safe to say it is still heaven. 

My failure is that I didn't even have room to taste their dessert...It looked amazing and professionally prepared. Cheesecakes, tarts, cakes all personal sized and ready to be savored. But alas, not I.

The food was so good - totally amazing for a buffet!  While we have been back to Vegas many times since then, and have eaten at various buffets, we never had the chance to try this one again until our recent trip, where we stayed at the Bellagio.

We arrived on a Friday night, and once we got settled into our room and made it downstairs, it was around 7:30.  We were happy that there was not too much of a wait.  We were seated within 20 minutes.  One member of our party was in a wheel chair, and the table we were seated at was kind of in the middle of everything. 

The food was good, but nothing spectacular like I remembered.  Some of the variety was different than some other buffets, like beef stroganoff with super tender beef.  Other than that, nothing really stood out.  I will note that the cost was not exorbitant, something like $40pp.  My hubby liked the crab legs, and for that price, it was a bargain.

I asked my hubby about the difference between the last time we came and now.  Maybe I thought it was grander than it really was back then.  Or maybe I've had so many nice meals in the past 6 years, buffet and not, that it takes more to impress me?

Dessert station is really nice with so many options.
Staff are friendly but they're busy and it could take them sometimes to check up on you.
One advice is going to buffet toward the end of lunch time, this way you'd pay for the lunch which is normally cheaper and you can sit through the dinner and enjoy the added items for dinner as well.",0,0,0

When we arrived it was NO LINE! Yes... NO LINE! On Mother's Day?! WOW! I was in complete shock I had to ask one of the employee's is this place even open! Lucked out completely because we had no wait! The price was I believe close to $60 per person from what I can remember but on Mother's Day that's standard for most of the hotels to charge at the buffet! 
The selection of food items, yes were a bit smaller compared to other buffet's but I had no complaints because it got the job done and my Mom loved it! My favorite part about all of it was the fact that they offered both KING CRAB legs and Snow! The option to have them heated was pretty neat because all you needed to do was pile your plate up as much as you wanted and the chef would heat them up for you! 
The ""All You Can Drink"" option can be added on for an additional $12-15 and when I called I was told it was $12, when we actually got there the waitress said $15! Whatever she wanted to argue and I didn't care I was only concerned with drinking! I did explain to her what I was quoted on the phone and she didn't care at all!

+ SHRIMP COCKTAIL -- these shrimps were on steroids or something, cus they be fat as FFFFF!

+ good ol' plain salmon or tuna sashami -- can't go wrong if they always be fresh!

+ good ol' caesar salad

and last but not least....

+ grab about 5 plates of their itty bitty pieces of cheesecake. here i go with a FRIENDS reference -- you'd want to still pick at this cheesecake even after it's fallen on the ground. ""mama's little bakery from chicago, illinois?"" no one gets my references :(

I've eaten at many Vegas buffets over the years and the only ones that have ever blown my mind is Aria Buffet, Wicked Spoon @ Cosmo, MGM Grand, and Luxor (the latter two particularly because of value for their brunch buffets).

I originally planned to go to the Caesar's buffet (Bacchanal-something) but the line for that was at least 45 minutes or more.  I was really craving a buffet with some asian selections, which you'll typically find in the more pricier buffets.  Since Bellagio was close, I took a chance and made my way over there, where the wait was only about 20 minutes.  

Like most night time buffets, there was piles of crab legs.  What I like at the pricier places is that they precut the legs so you don't have to spend half the night cracking open legs, pulling out the meat, and praying that you didn't screw up the pull to where half the meat gets stuck in the shell.

There's a salad bar, dessert bar, bread bar, soup bar, yadda yadda.  They also had a sushi bar and italian, american, spanish, and chinese choices.  Unfortunately, no shao mai or har gow but they had gai lan, chicken in black bean sauce with pea pods, char siu bao, fried rice, and something else I can't remember.  It was all delicious but little did I know that was the ""worst"" part of the meal.

I had their pasta and O M G it was delicious!  Cheese tortellini in walnut pesto sauce, beef ravioli in cream sauce, and chicken and sundried tomato bowtie pasts....all of these were incredible!  

Then it got even better when I went to the sushi bar because they had salmon poke and ahi poke.  For those of you that know me, I am a salmon fiend.  I LOVE SALMON.  Smoked, grilled, sushi grade raw, broiled, I'll eat it.  Even the crappy salmon they serve at cheaper buffets, I'll eat it.

That salmon poke was AMAZING.  They used quality sushi grade salmon to make it.  That salmon was so delicious, I feel like I definitely got my money's worth. 

The desserts were delicious as well...I had their tiramisu and cheesecakes.  I was shocked to see ice cream machines instead of gelato stations like other contemporary buffets.  Negative points to that.

Also, this buffet wasn't very vegan friendly....unfortunately I can't take the Vegan GF here because all she could eat is the build your own salad, lentil soup, the chinese broccoli, and maybe some sushi rolls.  Wicked Spoon was far vegan friendlier.  However, the italian food and the salmon poke just made this place amazing for me.

First off, there is no shortage of buffets in Vegas, if you have some cash you'll find somewhere to stuff your face until you need to be rolled out in a wheelbarrow. That said, the hard part is finding a good buffet. Sure you can find $5 all-you-can-eat burgers, but if you want quality along with quantity you have to be prepared to spend some more. 

At $30 a person for dinner ($37 Fri. and Sat.), The Buffet at Bellagio is not cheap, but oh is it worth every penny. More often than not, quality falls rapidly as quantity goes up (Looking at you, Luxor) but Bellagio has proven that very good food served buffet style is possible. There is often a long line of people trying to drown their sorrows of losing their last hand of poker in infinite food (just kidding, not really), so be prepared to budget about 30-45 minutes of wait time. When you get inside the space is very well laid out with tables arranged around the central food extravaganza. There is a large staff busily making sure you find a table, that plates are cleared out of the way and drinks are constantly being refilled, and all of them are very professional acting and dressed (props, Bellagio). 

When you do get your food you'll probably be unsure of where to start due to the amazing array present. In short, if you crave it, they will likely have it. Juicy roasts? yup. Stir fry? That too, as are made to order sushi, salads, and Asian, Mexican, Italian, and American comfort cuisine on top of many more. In addition, the requisite unlimited shrimp cocktail and massive split king crab legs are present. The dessert selection is equally as impressive, with gelato, fresh fruit, crepes and pastries as far as the eye can see. 

So what makes Bellagio so different that they can offer high quality food in such a plebeian style? Well, here is where the clients come in. There is a constant stream of people who are willing to spend a few extra bucks for the promise of good food; as a result, food turnover is very high. Fresh food can be seen being cooked right behind the counters and are constantly being brought out. No food is left to sit for hours under heating lamps slowly withering away; it's always fresh and made with care. 

By the end of the meal, me and my entire family were more than happy with what we got. The food was very good, the service quick, attentive and personable with multiple servers stopping by to check on us and even engaging us in conversation. It's obvious Bellagio put effort into making their buffet stand above the rest and it shows. 

If you want to keep eating your unlimited $5 burgers go right ahead, but I know where I will be returning if a major case of the hungry ever hits in Vegas. Shell out the $30 for dinner and you won't regret it, anyways, you can always win it back later in one last round of blackjack.",3,2,2

Service - excellent ... drinks always full and waiter responsive to our requests.
Cleanliness - very clean
Price - $25.00 per person
Seafood - shrimp, salmon, tilapia, tuna, etc.
Meats - prime rib, turkey, chicken, etc
Dessert - enough to become obese
Fruits - yes
Other - has some sushi and breakfast food items @ lunch as well

It's a buffet so here are the list of things I got the most of:

Shrimp - 1.3 plates - served good size shrimp--not wimpy shrimps you see at most buffets.  Damn, I'm already at home and wishing that I got another plate.  The cocktail sauce was excellent--I hate cocktail sauce that is too overpowering, but this one was perfect.

Prime rib - 1 serving - Excellent!!  It was prepared perfectly in my opinion--really tasty, moist, and tender.  Only got 1 serving b\/c I wanted to try the other cuisines\/entres.

Bacon - 2 servings - come on now ... who doesn't love bacon?  The bacon was cooked border-line between crispy yet still tender--that's perfect for me.  My dream is to consume a plate load of bacon, but in order save some prime stomach real estate ... I didn't.

Turkey - 1 serving - was really delicious ... tasty, moist, and tender.  I hate turkey that is dry.  Put some raspberry jam on both slices and I was in heaven.  

Breakfast sausages - 1 serving (2 sausages) - Oooohh ooohhh ... can you see my O-face?  Yes, it was delicious.  Plus, like bacon, who doesn't love a good sausage for breakfast ... or lunch ... or even dinner.

Chicken - 1 serving - I think I can eat chicken for the rest of my life ... and I definately can eat Bellagio chicken for the rest of my life.  Sucked the delicious, tasty meat straight off the bone ... used the bone as a toothpick.

I didn't get a chance to eat as much as I would of liked since our group had a reservation @ Smith and Wollensky @ 6pm--we ate @ 1ish.

Be prepared for a super, super long line - I think we waited for a whole hour as our stomachs growled.  On the bright side, I was surrounded by slot machines which gave me something to do.  On the down side again....I was robbed of $15 to the slot machines.

After an eternal hungry long hour, we finally made it to the cashier line.  $25ish bucks for Sunday brunch and unlimited champagne is an additional $5.  I opted for the champagne as drinking mimosas while stuffing ones face sounded like a pretty good plan.  

We were quite relieved to finally get inside and be seated.  From a visual standpoint, I somewhat expected a fancier buffet being that it was the Bellagio, but everything was pretty standard.  I cruised through - checking to see what goodies were up for grabs.  

I saw:  prime rib, pizza, pasta, cocktail shrimp, around 4 selections of sushi, different variety of potatoes,  fish (no idea what kind since I don't fancy fish), spring rolls, miso soup, ham, turkey, Belgium waffles, scrambled eggs, cereal, oatmeal, etc.  Desserts included chocolate eclairs, flan, cheesecake, tarts, cookies, etc.    Overall the food quality was good+.  However; I had a hard time finding stuff that I actually wanted to eat.

The sushi selection was really boring and quality was OK.  If you're a sushi lover, you'll probably be disappointed with their brunch selection.  

We got in around 2 and ended up still being there by the time dinner rolled around (4pm).  Since we were too full, we couldn't take advantage of the dinner items.  It's probably a good strategy to come in late to pay the lunch rate to get the dinner selection.

To me, that meant fish of all kinds from amaaazing sushi and sashimi salads, to the best sea bass I've had, to soft, baked salmon to 3 different kinds of crab legs. I honestly don't even remember what the other meats were because I was so busy stuffing my face with the seafood. I do remember the dessert station though because I had an amazing dark chocolate mouse and nutella cup. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm eating all my meals here.",0,0,0

The weekend dinner selection is the best but it is also reflected in the price.  There's always a good selection of food and desserts here.  I was bummed they didn't have any chocolate covered strawberries this past weekend (maybe they're out of season now? I don't know anything about fruits.).

Got to the hotel at 3pm to make the lunch hour, and ended up waiting on line for over an hour! Did I leave the line and go find another venue, no, did I listen to my inner voice that this wait is longer than Pirates at Disney, noooo, did I end up paying the dinner rate, in stead of the lunch rate? YES! I know right? I should have left, but since I spent that much time on the line I felt I was committed to the task.

That said, the food is meh at best. They are very cautious with seasonings, and the selection is OK, but when you expect one taste and get another, it is unfortunate.

Now I know that one should lower expectations when going to a buffet, but then again, why should one?

Overall, this skarf and barf is not worth the effort, nor the credit it gets.

You would be better off on a prix fix menu at one of the better places in the hotel.",0,0,0

the best part for me was the desserts.. i loaded my plate up and everything was fantastic. the creme brulee was very thick and creamy... yum. the peach pana cota was rich and fruity and also very good. the chocolate covered strawberries were great (although those would be hard to mess up) the rocky road mousse was perfection in a cup and the chocolate rasberry mousse in a mini chocolate waffle cone was delicious

We read online about the caviar bar on the weekends and the all you can drink margaritas, sparkling wine, bloody Mary and beer for an additional $11.99. We were looking forward to a nice dinner at a reasonable price for four teachers. 

We were ushered to the cashier. We told the cashier lady that we would like to add the $11.99 alcohol option and she responded roughly saying ""YOUR server takes care of that."" My wife and our friends just looked at each other as if we said something to offend her. It's not our problem if the cashier has to clarify the details to customers. It's part of her job to make every customer understand any questions they might ask about her place of employment. Not a good first impression, GRADE: F

We paid, we're seated, then our waiter (Alfredo) came and ask what we would like to drink. We told him all of us would like the alcohol option and started to order margaritas and ask if he could bring us wine after the margaritas. Then he pointed out that we can only make one choice between the four alcohol options. Alfredo was apologitic and made other beverage suggestions which was nice of him. He is a good employee who tried to protect the company. But to me, my wife and our two friends, this is deceptive marketing. I don't think we were the first to be fooled and definitely won't be the last. All four of us canceled the alcohol option and ordered ice teas. Alfredo then let us know that he was going home and Richard was going to take care of us. Our new waiter Richard was attentive and made sure our drinks were always full. Not a good second impression because of the misleading advertisement but Alfredo and Richard made up for it. GRADE: B

Then all four of us went to get some appetizers. We searched for the caviar bar but we're unable to find it. I asked a person next to me if she knew where the caviar is and she said she's also looking for it. We both approached a lady who was working in the sushi section and asked where the caviar bar is. She said it's only on Friday and Saturday.  So we both said that we thought it's served on the weekends and Sunday is a weekend.  The lady in the sushi section replied to us, ""yes, the weekends but not on Sunday."" More misleading information. Not a good third impression, GRADE: F

I told my wife and our two friends that not only were we mislead about the alcohol option but also the caviar bar on weekends. All four of us quickly finished our meals, gave a 20% tip and left.

Price = average for a strip resort.
Cashier = not acceptable, poor front line customer service.
Our waiters Alfredo and Richard = above average.
Food = average, nothing stood out.
Advertisment = not acceptable, misleading tactics.

Just got out of lunch buffet today, very disappointed. I felt totally ripped off at $38 per person with the selection and quality of food they have now. First, the prime rib is half the size of what it used to be, plus it's over cooked and super tough. King crab, snow crab, caviar, salmon\/tuna sushi all no where to be found today. The pork ribs and fish are all dryer out and under seasoned. The remaining selection is all breakfast stuff like pancakes, waffle, bacon and eggs. That's what you call holiday gourmet lunch buffet?

Food was tasteless. Most over cooked And the crab legs were no bigger than a pencil and COLD who serves steamed crab legs cold? 

The sweet section was nothing more than frozen petit fours that you could buy at a Sams club thaw and serve. Was told they were made fresh in house daily. Not true. Maybe unfrozen daily. 

116.00 for 3 people and honestly I would have enjoyed Panda Express more than here. Waited about 45 minutes to get seated and probably only ate for 20 minutes and that's walking through the lines included

At the end, it failed my expectation in every single way that left me the taste of unsavoriness after I left this restaurant.
The Buffet begins with a ridiculously long waiting line, which until now, I don't understand the hype behind it. Lucky for us, we didn't have to wait long since ""the customers left quickly after they came"", according to the cashier. But sadly, my joke ""hopefully it's not because of the food"" actually became true!!
Before you can pick up a plate and get whatever you want to gorge, you were seated in a place that instantly reminds you that maybe a ""restaurant"" like Denny's offers you better place, somehow it looks amazingly familiar to any Chinese buffet that you happen to visit in your life: Full of people, loud, messy, horrible decor.. Not exactly quite an enjoyable feeling to start your dishes.
Now, let's talk about the main ""spotlight"": the food, the reason that immediately disappointed me after I finish my first plate. My impression with The buffet at Bellagio is that half of the Buffet is Chinese food (which I recommend you should go to PF. Chang for better quality) and the rest of the buffet is a combination of a hell lot of things that left you no remark in your mind no matter how hard you try to remember. Oh my mistake, the Kobe Beef is okay but the rest is...""Cliché"". The lamb is not that special, it's dry and has nothing to remember about the taste. The turkey, the Alaska crab and King Crab made you regret that you got too much on your plate of it and the amount of time you have to line up for that (take note: the line is bizarrely long). Even you asked the chef to heat up the seafood for you, it's still cold and you curse your life that now you have to eat those. The seafood definitely doesn't meet up your expectation. I would give the seafood 2* out of 5.
Next, you move quickly to the main reason what got you here tonight: The Caviar. You have to stay in a line, but fortunately, it's not too long since maybe people are not aware of the fact that Bellagio also offers Caviar, maybe it's too small to notice. The Chef will handle you 3 small pieces of some bread that have caviar on top of that. The truth is those bread are the murderers of the taste of the caviar which are supposed to deliver. Normally, they go with cracker or at least some crispy bread, but this one is soft and kinda sweet. They viciously deconstructed and ruined the whole flavor of the caviar which made you question yourself: Did you just have caviar since you don't even feel a thing???? Next round, I decided to leave the bread out and had the caviar by itself, it's better but I really don't want to go all the way there and get 3 tiny bites of caviar again since they don't give you more than that each round. I wish I wouldn't pay $50 (included tip and tax) for this Gourmet meal, you have way better selection out there, folks, way better!!
And another sad news for sushi and sashimi lovers, Bellagio has a poor selection of sushi and really boring sashimi. Their sushi and sashimi made you think that any sushi restaurants that you've been to could gives a better offer than this one.
Not only the lame sushi section, their dessert is not remarkable either. I don't remember much except the feeling, even the Wicked Spoon buffet, aka an extended version of Panda Express gives you more satisfactory than the dessert at the Bellagio. Gosh, the whole meal is like an endless torturing and regretful feeling that you want to get out as soon as possible after you tried to gorge to make up for $50 you paid for that.
And did I mention about the attitude of the chefs working there? Oh gosh, it's not nice, in my personal experience. They made you feel like you still are in high school cafeteria begging the lunch lady to give you better food. 
I tried to hard to find one reason to come back to The Buffet at Bellagio but couldn't come up with any... Oh well, now at least I can say ""The gourmet buffet at the Bellagio??? Urghh, I pass!!"" with confidence.",0,0,0

First off, we get there and get seated, and I place my carry-on bag (we had just flown in and it was too soon to check in, and I needed stuff in my bag) in my chair so I can go get my breakfast. I come back and take the bag out of my seat and find that the bottom of my bag is now stained with raspberries! The stain is still there, it won't come out, and this was October '07. So if my bag had not been stained my pants would have been, since the raspberries were in my chair. So minus a point for not being clean - the floor was also covered in crumbs and small bits of trash (messy eaters or kids). Anyway, the lines for the food were insane, so my husband and I thought the food must be really good. I will say the waffles were amazing, but the eggs were runny, the biscuits were ok, and my husband said that the bacon and coffee were not good. Speaking of coffee, it took forever to get a waitress to take our drink order. Our waitress disappeared for most of our meal after we got our drinks, so we didn't get one refill. I think I ended up eating a bowl of cereal, a waffle, and half a biscuit - definitely not worth what we paid. Maybe dinner is better, I don't know.

I can't even make Campbell's soup out of the can, but even I can make scrambled eggs that are m-m-m . . . better than those at the Bellagio Buffet.

Dinner is a different story, and not just because it costs $36.95.  In the evening, the Buffet at Bellagio transforms into a veritable gastronomical utopia, inviting you to partake in a feast of gargantuan proportions. 

I don't eat shellfish, but I hear great things about their crab legs and other delicacies I can't look at.  I can't vouch for the shellfish though.  I usually start with some sashimi and Hawaiian poke.  Both are excellent here, by the way.  Then, once I've warmed up (it's a marathon, not a sprint), I move on to the meats.  You can find carving stations serving such buffet staples as prime rib and turkey breast, both of which are better than prime rib and turkey breast at other places.  

What truly separates Bellagio Buffet from all the others is the variety and the exotic nature of their buffet.  They constantly offer tender Kobe beef (American fed, but still), pretentious Beef Wellington, venison, which is as good or better than you would find in nearby restaurants, and perfectly prepared lamb chops.  Y-U-MMMM!  Last time, they offered steak tartare (not recommended for rookie and amateur carnivores) and seafood vol-au-vent, made to order (not recommended for me).

The desserts here are good, but not extraordinary.  You could probably find similar offering at any buffet in Vegas.

The lines are really long, but if you play table games, you might be able to ask the pit boss for a line pass or a voucher.  $36.95 is a lot to pay, unless you can eat that much seafood and\/or meat.  Are you up to the challenge?",4,3,4

Disappointments: The desserts. Anytime you give me unlimited bread pudding (with toppings), I will be a fan, but I was unhappy with the overall selection of desserts. Needs to be more variety, not just rich cake-like treats that are heavily frosted.

They have the basics covered - eggs, sausage, bacon, ham, potatoes, french toast, pancakes, omelette station, fruit, yogurt, cereal, bagels, etc. Then a salad area, a few cold seafood salads, and a seemingly random area with I guess  ""Asian"" options, like miso soup and noodles and that type of thing.

Needless to say, this will be the last and final time I will ever eat here and to anyone who reads this, take heed! The price hasn't gone down but the quality of the food is worth the 2 stars I gave. 
There are tons of other buffets in Vegas  (although pricier) that I would rather go to just because I know I can get the crab I want.
Well, that's my story. I'm actually saddened that I will never step foot into this casino and this buffet ever again. (Unless the parking is free and the crab is changed!)",1,1,0

We got seated rather quickly because it was kinda early for dinner time.

There was nothing special about the food. very mediocre. Sushi was mediocre-it didn't taste as fresh as I had hoped.

Dessert was NOT good. It looks really good & pretty though. To get my money's worth, I tried a bite of every single dessert they had. haha, yes my taste buds got a little confused here and there. Hands down, the creme brulee was the best! That one is the only one worth trying in my opinion :) Cheesecake was alright but like I said, nothing special.

A random note: They have ostrich there..
I'm a pescetarian so I don't eat that stuff but my friends all tried it and had to spit it out and chase it down with soda..I guess you can try if you want. Maybe it's an acquired taste but just a slight warning..it smells & looks pretty gross.

The only reason I didn't give this 2 stars instead of 3 is because our waiter was super friendly. He kept coming back to take away our plates & refill our drinks.

Carnival World Buffet at the Rio used to be my fave but this one has usurped it, lol.

Many, many stations with a large variety of foods. The crap legs seemed to be a favorite of diners but I myself, didn't try them. While I love crab meat, these, as is the case with most, are just too much work for too little reward, at least for me...

What really surprised me was the pizza. I tried two varieties, (Hawaiian and Veggie), and both were out of this world! And they had these little ""hash"" type filled little fritter thangs that were out of this world!!!

My only real disappointment was with the Prime Rib. While I'd really prefer a rib eye steak over prime rib any day, I'll invest in the occasional slice when the opportunity presents itself. But this slice fell short. Lackluster marbling, dry and little to no flavor, even with a really pink center. And I had the first cut!!!

When you goto Vegas for a nice buffet, you go for the one with brand names. Pairs, Bellagio, Wynn. That's why we choose Bellagio, and the result? Very disappointed comparing with its reputation.

We arrived in Vegas earlier than expected, which means the dinner plan changed to a late lunch. Good news is no waiting line and price is cheaper, bad news is that the choices of the food is quite limited.

First of all, where does all the seafood go? There is a section for cocktail shrimp, a section for seafood salad, a couple of hot dishes for salmon and cod. Then that's pretty much it. Lobster? Crab? Oyster? Clams? None exist. Seriously it got less seafood choices than any decent buffet in any American city.

And, don't get me started in the salad section. I didn't plan to feed on salad, but the choice is way too less. When I look at the few options of lettuce leaves, croutons, and dressing, I feel I was in old country buffet.

Maybe because there are more and more Asian people coming to visit, they added sushi session and some Chinese dishes. The quality and choices of those dishes are not impressive though.

OK, they got lots of choices for pizza and pasta. Unfortunately I seldom eat carbs expect during buffet time, so it's not attractive to me. It's common sense. Who feeds on pasta in buffet? Unless it comes with black truffle sauce, I won't eat one bite of pasta in buffet time.

And the ice cream machine...seriously? Not gelato, just a pull handle ice cream machine like old country buffet? We're in Bellagio, one of the most expensive hotel in Vegas and I definitely didn't expected to see that ice cream machine here.

I'll stop the whining and change to some positive feedbacks.

Beef dishes are good. I tried both steak and beef brisket, both are very juicy and tender. Make sure to ask the chef to cut you thin slice though otherwise it's too thick. Talking about chef, can they smile a little bit?

Dessert section is impressive, I must admit. Tons of choices and they kept changing them. Half of my lunch I was feeding on dessert. Very colorful and beautiful, unfortunately quite rich at the same time.

Here is something interesting, at around 4pm when we finished and about to leave, half of the guests in the eating area rushing to the seafood section and line up. It turned out that the crab legs are out and they looks pretty fresh. Too bad we're very stuffed and couldn't take another bite. We didn't even bother to get into the line.

We sneaked in at 2,45, payed lunch price (27usd each) and got the Dinner Buffet. I had 8 plates, there were things i didn't like, or didn't find Specials, and there were things that I would have begged for, i could bath in. The Prime rib, the mushroom Ravioli, the canneloni, the Indian Curry, the yam Mash, the turkey (!), And the blue cheese Dressing, the Olive bread, the nutella- White chocolate Creme tard,...... I found the meats, the pastas and the Desserts in generell really good. Dissapointing was the seafood, don't know why all those asians eat Tons and Tons of those crablegs.. it's just a hint of salt and a Kind of fishy taste.. i was so incredibly Full, wished i had another 3 stomachs to eat more. So Worth it 27 Bucks.",0,1,0

ENTREE
- kobe sirloin is a bit dry even though it was cooked to medium
- leg of lamb was pretty good and juicy, except the mint jelly was on the counter by the heat lamp so it was more like mint soup
- prime rib (got 2 servings cuz the first cut was rare and the second cut was medium well) -- where is the medium rare cut?
- crab legs - had both king crab and snow crab, nicely cut but a little bit on the salty side - can't complain about crab legs (and it's hard to mess up crab legs sitting on ice)
- had two different fish (one was sea bass) - it was decent
- ahi and salmon poke had good flavor but the fish tasted a bit mushy
- sauteed bakchoy was delicious (i actually ate about 6 or 7 stalks of it) - cooked just right, not too raw and not over cooked, salted just right

sad to say the rest of the entrees didn't really interest me and I skipped the salads

DESSERT
one thing i enjoy most about buffets are their dessert because they come in bite-size portions and a wide variety of selection but nothing I had today was 'to-die-for' - meaning I wouldn't care for seconds.  Don't get me wrong, the stuff was good: creme brulee, flan, little creamed filled waffle cones, mille feuille, ice cream, cookies, fruit tart.  I had them all :)

The last time I came to Bellagio's buffet was back in 2003 on a weekend and it left a lasting memory.  So maybe it was my mind playing tricks on me after 8 years, but it wasn't as good as I had remembered.",0,0,0

I feel as if I am taking this experience as positively as I can and present you with the postulation that I have been more bestowed with the  responsibility of giving you the knowledge I so desperately needed 24 hours ago. 

This buffet has its nerve calling what tasteless slop they are passing off as food edible. I have to say, I was so hungry I probably could have eaten anything but there was not one dish served here that I tried that even remotely had any pleasant taste to it. It was either weird tasting (the tacos... Wtf was in that guac? How do you screw up guac?), had a disgusting texture (pretty sure mashed potatoes shouldn't all pick up on one fork when you take a bite but good news is you could lay bricks with it), or was just outright tasteless (I *think* it was corn chowder?). 

And come on. How you gonna mess up a cake?  It's flour and sugar. Children make cakes. There's just no excuse for serving some nasty stale tasteless crud. 

I would be ashamed to feed people that food let alone charge for it. 

Now for the dirty details...

I asked for a regular coke. Got a diet. No big deal. I'm a flexible girl and I'm pretty easy going. But when I ask a dude for a regular coke and he's gone for twenty minutes and I reduce myself to actually drinking a diet coke you know it just got real. I had to bus my own table by moving my dirty dishes to a table people had already left with Brie dirty dishes. I started making what I referred to as the leaning tower of shame. So I thought, hey. The manager probs should know about this so I said listen up, bro. Here's what's wrong with your establishment and from my lips to Gods ears, changes need to happen starting ground up my friend. Ground. Up. 

My compensation? I got offered a bottle of wine. I don't drink. And 20% of my bill. I didn't eat anything. 

However. This wholeeeeee experience makes me wanna start drinking. So there's that in my life now. 

Long story short this place will be getting my bill for Betty ford. And Burger King. 

Deuces, Bellag. You won't be blessed with the grace of my awesome company again and that, I feel, is the ultimate punishment.",5,10,1

Usually when I go to buffets, I'm starving so no surprise...when we got there I was HUNGRY! So I decided to circle around the area to see what they have. For Vegas buffet, I felt the the selections were very limited and there was much things that appealed to me. But, I was still manged to get a little of everything.

Because of my body's revolt, I was unable to eat as much as I wish I did. I managed to eat a few bites at a time, because my stomach was feeling queasy since the morning. At the time, I thought I'd give the place 3 stars, but now that I am more clear headed, i think the Bellagio is well worth 4 stars.

If you come here during lunch time during the weekday, you can get in for $20.99 and stay till dinner! Are you kidding me? That's a freaking good deal! It's nothing phenomenal, but for $20.99 the food is pretty damn good! If you come during lunch, they even have some breakfast foods out. I had some eggs benedict, and it was pretty good!

The pastas are also delicious and so are the meats. Had my stupid stomach been feeling better, I would have totally gone after some prime rib, crab legs, and all that deliciousness. They even have jus to put over your roast\/meat, and it's delicious! They have a pretty good selection of food. It's not individually portioned out. 

One thing that bothered me was the soup station. the ladle was too damn long! It was so hard to ladle soup into my bowl. I burned myself. Shorten that ladle, dude. 

Seating for me took about 30-40 minutes, kind of what you would expect from a buffet. But I would say it was well worth it. To get the biggest bang for the buck, come during the weekday during lunch (like around 2:30) and stay til dinner. =) cheers!",4,3,4

Yes, they have the crab legs. Yes, they have the melted butter that goes with it too! Yes, they have creme brulee! And if it's out on the floor, yes, they will also have Kobe beef :9'' Yum!

Tips to survive the Buffet at Bellagio

Tip#1: DO NOT GET TOO MUCH OF ONE THING

If any person knows the best way to eat at a buffet, it's ME! You take a little of everything here and there for a little taste.  Think of the buffet as uncharted territory and Capt. Stomach has sent you on a mission to find the best eatery and bring it back to base.  You're sent on a recon out and you're faced with an amalgam of tastes and smells EVERYWHERE! If it looks good and smells good, take a little to see if it tastes good; especially if it's your first time trying it. Do not grab a pound of the mediterranean salad, take a bite, and dump it. Please. And if it tastes good, don't get too much because there's a million other things to try here also!

Tip #2: Create a plan!
Make a map even! Walk around the buffet first to see what you're working with a keep a mental of what's where, what everyone is going for, what seems to be the most popular item on the buffet line. Do all of this so you know where to start. Don't just start picking and grabbing here because unlike the other buffets, I've noticed this to be the most cultured of cuisines. I'm not talking about tacos and orange chicken-culture. I'm talking about bistro-worthy eats that you won't find at a Taco  Bell or a Panda Express!


Tip#3: Start light and work your way up!

So you're out on the buffet line, empty plate in hand, and you're a hunter with a hunger. Start light with their salad. It's on it's own island so you're won't have too much trouble finding it. Sounds epic doesn't it? Haha! There's also a little sushi bar. Sometimes they'll even have beef tartare! Mmmm. Then after you've warmed your insides, take a tour of the seafood: crab legs THAT ARE ALREADY CUT (awesome!), the sea bass is GREAT as also. If you're lucky to come at a time when they have Kobe beef, get some! It's absolutely scrumptous! It is extremely tender and melts like butter in your mouth!

If you're a local, take your friends here if they really want a taste of what Las Vegas buffets and food is all about! Enjoy and happy eating! :)",4,5,8

Came here on a Tuesday night at 6pm and there was already a long line. Luckily the Mlife line only had 5 people in it so we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. The dining area is ginormous with tons of tables and constant movement. The food area is disorganized in my opinion, with ropes trying to section off certain stations, but all this does is cause confusion. This is the only buffet I was at that did not flow at all (to clarify I went to 3 other ones during my stay and they were just as large and busy but they were easy to navigate). I ended up refusing to walk back up after my second not very full plate because I was annoyed with people walking in all directions bumping into you.

My mother and I agreed this was our least favorite buffet we went to. Too chaotic and so many ill mannered people here. Glad we only spent $35 for the 2 of us since we used a myvegas bogo. If it's this busy on a Tuesday it must be a complete stand still on the weekend!",1,0,1

No shame when we get to the buffet and stuff our faces.

We came here on Saturday for brunch and it could have just been the high expectations, but I must say that it did not quite knock me off my feet. To start with the good, the cold seafood appetizer section was delectable enough, ranging from New Zealand mussels to a calamari and sausage salad. The standout here was the scallop ceviche. It was clearly fresh and the pairing with mango was a nice touch - scallops themselves were tender and not overpowered with lime. The smoked salmon was a pleasant surprise as well. Now with the standout items discussed, let's move on to the more average fare. Quite simply put, the Bellagio (during brunch at least) is lacking in variety and innovation. The oysters and littlenecks were not present, instead diners only had access to cocktail shrimp. The meat section consisted of only prime rib-which was a bit too overdone for my liking. The ""sushi"" section was disappointing too (as is the case for most buffets). The maki rolls had way too much rice and only two types were present-neither of which had real fish or seafood. Aside from the decor and the aforementioned appetizer items, nothing really differentiated the Buffet at the Bellagio from other establishments.

I had an opportunity of dining at Bellagio buffet for the second time. We ate for dinner during the holidays rush, so we had to pay close to $55 per person.

 This time was actually pretty good and had a lot of varieties of food to choose from. 

I have never had beef wellington before, I've only heard and seen it on Hell Kitchen, but man it was moist and good. 

They even had Pho. It was blend, but eatable. 

They even had Alaskan King Crab Legs, which is the most expensive crab legs out there. I spent most of my time, eating the King Crab legs and not the Snow crab legs since you can find snow crab legs for dinner at every buffet in Vegas.

I didn't get any sushi, but man, the lines were looong to get some made to order sushi roll.

Deserts were abundant. They even have Macarons. I saw one diner got a whole plateful of Macarons, I'm assuming they going to stuff that into their purse to take home.

Service was good. Server kept clearing the plates quick.

Overall, it was a pretty good dining experience.

We went right at 330pm which is the best time to go before 4pm and pay the lunch price of $17.99 and be able to try thier lunch at dinner courses.  Dinner is $29.99  Unfortunately we didnt get to try lunch because we waited in line for 30 mins but thats the case at any buffet in Vegas.  When our turn was up and we were led to a table I looked around and I felt the place was a little tight in space.  The atmoshpere felt old and out dated and the lights were very dim as if it was meant to be romantic but i guess thats ok for some people.  The buffet line up did not move me off my feet like the Sutdio B buffet at the M Resort and Casino but none the less it held its own.  I was a little disappointed by the options because i had high expectations because of my fellow yelpers.  Dont get me wrong the Bellagio buffet is good just not as good as Studio B but it is conveniant for being on the strip.
     The buffet is like a big letter ""C' with the beverage bar and dessert station in the center of it all.  I dont know why but one side of the whole place was completely empty while everyone was jam packed on the other side.  Anyways, of course being a carnivore i started with the carving station which had prime rib (my all time favorite), roast of lamb, turkey breast and Kobe beef tri tip.  I know my steaks and the Kobe beef tri tip was really dry and i could tell it was Kobe beef because of the high fat content but for some reason is was very disappointing.  All these meats were accompanied by the usual sauses such as horseradish cream, au jus and gravy but thats all they were, usuals.  At the beginning of the buffet is the salad bar and i made it a mission to try and make me a plate of salad, but i failed lol.  Im a carnivore!  Next was the soup station but i didnt have any of that either and then the carving station followed by the seafood station.  I had some crab but it wasnt anything special and it was snow crab not the jumbo kind.  At the end of the line is a sushi station which had real sushi chefs( at least thats what they appered to be) making sushi.  The one thing i found funny was they had the vegetable sushi and crab sushi signs in the wrong places and i still managed to confuse myself.  Ha!  The sushi wasnt anything special either plus they didnt have anything set out when i walked up and there were like 10 people waiting.  I spotted the Ahi Poke and darted for it before anybody else realized it hahaha snooze you lose.
     My family had a little bit of everything because that is what you do at a buffet.  If you fill up on one thing then your gonna leave the rest undiscovered and when you find out theres more you're too stuffed.  Everyday we were in Vegas, my 3 yr old always wanted to eat ice cream, shes a junk food junkie, so im sure her favorite was the dessert station.  I really liked the dessert station too and that is the one the Bellagio buffet has on the Studio B buffet.  The desserts were really good especially for buffet fare.  Would i go back?

Dessert was pretty good. Im sad they did not have crepes. They served the normal cakes, tarts, cookies etc. I enjoyed the chocolate covered strawberries and tiramisu. What is dessert without Creme Brulee!! My fav! Not a fan of the dessert section I perfer the dessert selection at the Wynn better.

The line extended all the way outside and around the buffet. I took this as a good indication of how good the food was going to be.

We were quickly seated (had the front of the line pass). It took awhile before someone came to get our drinks. Seem like they were a bit understaffed that evening.

ONTO THE FOOD:

Pho Station: 
Not really a pho station since they didn't even have the pho rice noodles. Instead you get to pick either udon or mei fun (Chinese cellophane rice noodles; yes these were rice noodles but they're not the ones you find in your standard bowl of pho). The broth was either the dark broth (which honestly tasted like can beef broth; very salty) or the vegetable broth (which tasted funny). Definitely suggest you skip this station.

Hand Roll:
To my excitement I saw sheets of seaweed next to the sushi bar. I asked if those were for hand rolls and the guy said yes. So I asked for a California hand roll...  Nope, only roll they make there is spicy tuna hand roll. Great for tuna lovers, not so great for me.

Crab Legs:
They had 2 separate areas where you can find the crab legs. (Good job! Crowd control.) Once you select your legs, you can ask one of the staff to heat it up for you. The legs were hit or miss. It's mostly just ok tasting legs with the occasional super yummy\/sweet legs in between.

Salad Bar:
Who pays for a $50 buffet to eat salad? I do! (Mainly because everything else just looked whatever... so sad) I have to say, this was the highlight of my buffet experience. Three types of greens you can select from. A variety of toppings.

Dessert:
Lots to choose from. Portion was nice and small so you are able to try everything. I love flan so I had to try one of those. It was just ok. Didn't bother finishing it. 

OVERALL:

Would I come here again? I don't think so. For that price I would rather eat at Bacchanal.

The wait wasn't too bad, around 30 minutes. You pay immediately when you reach the front, and wait some more for an open table.

If you take a step back for an overview of the entire buffet line, there actually isn't that much variety as a few stations have the same food items that are just setup on different sides, and the accompaniments take up a good amount of space as well. I started in the cold station that consisted of smoked salmon and smoked trout, and a few seafood ceviche\/seafood salads. They were not good at all, especially the smoked trout as it tasted spoiled rather than smoked. The salmon was all right, not great. The Snow Crabs were not fresh and had an off taste. I tried two pieces thinking the first was just a bad one, but nope. They're all bad. The saving grace was the King Crab, which was sweet and fresh. And of course, loaded myself up on that. :) Other food items that I enjoyed were the pizzas, and the pesto mashed potatoes. That's it. The prime rib wasn't good at all. It wasn't seasoned enough, and the meat was more on the cold side.

The weakest station by far, and what I've ever experienced is the Sushi\/Asian station. The sushi was your the super basic rolls. There was also hand made tuna roll and summer rolls, which both were AWFUL. The nori on the tuna roll was soft, rice was tough...basically it probably sat there for a while. The same for the summer roll. The rice wrapper was thick and tough. It was inedible, and had to literally pull the wrapper out of my mouth because I couldn't even chew it. The filling tasted terrible as well. Connected with this station was the cheese and meat portion, which again, was your super basic cheeses and meats.

Don't get me started on the Chinese section! Seeing the fried rice and fried noodles, the overcooked Chinese Broccoli, congee, and the wonton soup with no wontons even visible was disheartening.

There was a breakfast station, which had your basics: scrambled egg, sausages, waffles, eggs benedict, bacon, French toast, potatoes, etc. Plus a ham and turkey carving station, and omelet station. Come on, it's 2PM, get rid of that breakfast station!

The dessert section looks big and appears to have many selections if you're just walking by while you're grabbing your main course items, but when you are ready for dessert, there actually isn't much of a selection because one half has the same stuff as the other. The dessert I had wasn't very good at all: caramel flan, tiramisu, bread and rice pudding, and this really bad raspberry white mousse cake that was awful.

Overall, I was expecting something more, something different, something atypical from the usual buffets I've experienced outside of Las Vegas, but I wasn't expecting to see the most basic and low end buffet, especially being located in the Bellagio. I was bewildered. Did I come on a rare day where it was out of everything? Whatever the case, I was fairly disappointed.",4,0,0

On my first round I had a made to order veggie omelet, potatoes, Belgian waffles and the second round I had sushi, pesto mashed potatoes,  a few different salads , asparagus and bread! The tea was even great! Make sure you have one of the fresh baked muffins, they are nice and fluffy.

Let's put it this way, your going to pay at least $35, for a good meal in Vegas (unless you like eating cheap and you don't buy alcohol) Why not make your spending worth it. 

The pro's
-great selection and fresh food.
-omelette station.
- turkey sausage (I don't eat beef or pork so seeing turkey was like a dream come true.)
- red velvet waffles, if you haven't tried it, you HAVE to.
- variety, pasta, crab legs, breakfast, many choices.
- great service, my waitress had the orange juice refills ready, before I could ask.

The con's
-fruit selection was minimum, no pineapple, no berries, but had your basic, melons, strawberries, oranges and bananas. 
- mimosa cost $12!!?!? Really, I just spent enough money to almost fill up my gas tank for a week and now I have to pay for a mimosa.

I was a little hesitant though when I saw that it cost $32.99 for New Years Brunch.  It's times like these where posting up a menu is very important, but I didn't see it anywhere.  So I took a chance with it.

This Brunch Buffet didn't really do it for me. I pretty much got the same stuff that I would've picked up at Flavors at Harrahs or Le Village at Paris for half the price.  The only way for me to make up the $32.99 was to load up on Crab Legs which is what I did (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=JP-DNf9eXH1T9IsESWsR5g).  I also picked up some Prime Rib and Eggs which were just okay.  There wasn't really anything offered at Brunch that really blew me away.

One of the better buffets in vegas out there, imo, although i've been here many times.  I will have to try the other newer buffets some time soon!  

We tried to go for lunch, around 3:30 and get lunch prices for dinner menu but it was super duper long so we ended up paying for dinner prices after 4 pm. boo.                        :(  So...definitely go earlier and stand in line before 3 pm, if you want to get lunch prices for dinner menu!

We all tried to get our money's worth for the buffet.  So, we tried to get all the expensive stuff - prime rib, seafood, crab legs, shrimp, kobe beef, etc.

Just a note.  We had a party of 10 so they charged us an additional 18% gratuity even though we all paid separately.  Deduct one star for that!  Any parties of 8 or more, there is mandatory 18% gratuity.  I guess you pay the extra grauity for sitting together.  

Food:  I got the prime rib, which was pretty good but i couldn't find the au jus.  Also got the kobe beef but it was too tough and not tender.  The outside of the kobe beef was overcooked and well done while the meat on the inside was all red!  I didn't eat that part at all.  it was just eh.

The ribs and pork belly were overcooked.  The pork belly was not juicy and fatty like it should be.  it was too hard.  The ribs were just ok.

I love the chilean sea bass!!  It's always one of my favorites and I try to get more of this for my money's worth.

The snow crab was just eh.  I only get it to justify the price i pay for the buffet.  haha.  But i'm actually not that big of a fan.  It's really salty and not a lot of flavor.

Shrimp cocktail is good.  i love shrimp!

Their desserts are just eh.  i wasn't too impressed with their desserts usually.  Although the last time I ate here, they had a lot of selections and the desserts were much better than other times i've gone.  Desserts included:  tiramisu, chocolate macarons, key lime pie, chocolate cake, fruit tarts, sugar free desserts, ice cream, etc.

Anyway, the food was mediocre at best, but the choices were so slim I was shocked.

But, I was really hoping for unique food items that you don't get on the day-to-day. This is definitely not the place for that. They are way more focused on quantity over quality. They did have a sushi bar, but it was the type of sushi you would find at a supermarket (mostly rice, basic ingredients, blah). 

The one good thing was that the waiter refilled our drinks whenever we needed it (even sometimes when we didn't need it) and a soda comes free with your dinner so you're not charged extra for it.

Basic opinion: underwhelming as most other reviewers seem to also agree on. Price: Definitely high and premium, possibly due to it being a well known hotel. 

My review is a little biased on the seafood and dessert since that is all I felt like trying. The other items including the carving station seemed like the usual that you could find at any other buffet. However do note that they do have rack of lamb and ribs. 

Crab - They had hot Dungeness crab which in my opinion was the best item there. Perhaps a little salty. They also had two cold options. King and more Dungeness which is a change from the snow crab you typically see at buffets however the cold optiond were small, dry, and salty. The king crab at Bacchanal was much larger, juicier. And sweeter.

Sushi - Salmon and tuna nigiri is above average quality. Rice balls are huge. I did not bother to eat the rice. Salmon and tuna poke was good. To-order spicy tuna hand roll was good. There were three caviar options which definitely stands out from other buffets. Other rolls were just vegetable rolls... didn't try those. 

Peeled shrimp - I love that it is already peeled and cleaned. They tasted very fresh and clean. Cocktail sauce could have been flavored more on the sweet side and less on the horseradish side. Just my opinion. 

Oyster - on the half shell. Cooked with cheese and spinach. Very good but chew slow if you want to taste the small amount of oyster. I wish they had raw ones. 

Dessert - Perhaps the most underwhelming of all. They didn't look as presentable or pretty. Seemed cheap. I usually save room for about three times what normal people would have for dessert but I did not finish my first selections. Also no gelato options...just soft serve ice cream machines that you can find at cheap buffets. No crepe options either. 

So oveverall why the low rating?
- It is normal to expect a line at a Vegas buffet. We waited about 25 min. Not bad at all. But when we for inside it was like a zoo. So crowded, noisy, and so many tables!! There was not much room to walk between the tables and it definitely felt like they jammed tables in. Even just to get your food you are bumping through crowds like Disneyland.
- Quality of the food...ok minus desserts. I guess what I am upset about is that it did not match all the hype I saw and read about online and through things promoting this very famous buffet. 
- Price is as expected but like I said above...they just did not deliver on experience or quality of food that matches the price. I honestly had a better experience at Carnival World, the Seafood one at the Rio that is now merged with Carnival, or the Bacchanal. 

Few pluses:

- Restrooms inside. Never seen that at a buffet before. Allows me to wash my hands after eating crab. 
- Self serve beverage stations with many choices. No need to flag anyone for refills.

We got there around noon and the line wasn't bad. We got seated within 15 minutes. Our server was nice and attentive. 

I was expecting at least 6-7 veggie options since I know they catered more for meat lovers but all I got was lo mein  noodles, asian style french beans and a miso soup which were good. I tried the pesto potato mash which was OK. Needed a little more flavor. They had a veggie pizza that didn't look appealing. There was a salad bar too but I didn't care for it.

I was hoping the desserts section might have more variety but I was disappointed again. They had very few options; key lime tart, pecan squares, tiramisu n NY cheesecake, strawberry tart. The only dessert I cared for was the chocolate mousse. No ice cream, gelato, coffee, macaroons or other desserts that other buffets offer.

Food = delicious!  

Highlights: Chilean sea bass with miso sauce, osso bucco (pork), Kobe beef and prime rib fried rice.  

They had some good Chinese food (gai lan!), meat carving station, rotisserie chicken, made-to-order taco station, large selection of seafood (including snow crab legs and crawfish).   Unfortunately, sushi wasn't impressive, as the rice was heavy and hard (I tried a roll) and the fish (nigiri) looked like it had been sitting way too long.  (Perhaps it was the lateness.)

(I have no idea why, but I always want salad.)   

Plenty to choose from, with quality ingredients. 

Desserts... lots to choose from. The chocolate dome and tiramisu were good.  They have soft serve, too. 

Drinks (non-alcoholic) are included.  Order when you're at the table.  

Service = friendly.  They were attentive with the drinks, cleared off the dirty plates and provided us with ample napkins.   

Prices = $34.99 for dinner buffet, Monday to Thursday. (It goes up to $39.99 for Friday through Sunday. And there are other prices for Chef's Table, Gourmet dinner, lunch, breakfast and weekend brunch.  They also offer an option of unlimited Margaritas, Bloody Marys, sparkling wine or beer for $12.99, for those in the mood for drinking.)

1) Some of the king crab legs were really salty, and others were really icy. You could taste the ice crystals. Both of these factors distracted from the anticipated heavenliness of the crab feast, so -1 star.

2) The desserts were generally not that impressive. The cheesecake, tiramisu, chocolate cake thingy, and non-brulee portion of the creme brulee didn't taste right. While I eventually found several desserts that I enjoyed (the dark chocolate cone thing; the bananas foster, which seems like a flambe or just heated bananas with a sweet syrup that worked out; the peach sorbet and raspberry sorbet), I expected far better than hit-or-miss quality from this place.

Now for some dishes that I would recommend if you choose to try this place: bass, seared bluenose fish with the dark sauce, leg of lamb, shrimp and pesto pizza, the pastas, and oh man, the shrimp cocktail was absolutely spectacular.

Anyways, we went to the VIP line (was nearly as long as the regular line) that was not so VIP. We had to wait 15 mins to pay. When arriving at the cashier, we specifically told the lady to charge us for all of our parties including tips (party of 6\/7ppl, some were still coming down from the room) and she obliged.  After paying, we waited another 15 mins were finally seated. 20 mins  later another lady came by and stated we must move to a different table because the cashier lady did not charge us for the other guests!

So anyways, me and my friends went to the Bellagio buffet for dinner and stood in line for like 30 minutes, but that's okay because once we sat down we ate for more than two hours straight. I could tell the waiters were getting annoyed at how long we were taking because for them time is money. They wanted us to hurry up, give them their stupid tip, and leave so that the next group of diners could sit down, hurry up and tip, leave, and so on. Screw those waiters. Don't mind the stairs they give you once you pass the one hour mark. Just tell them to clear your plates and keep the drinks coming in. Like WTF, those guys ain't even waiters because they don't even take your order. They are just overpaid busboys who think they deserve a $30 tip for clearing a table for a party of three. If I'm going to pay like $120 plus thirty bucks in tip for me and two other people to eat, I'm taking my sweet-ass time...know what I'm sayin'? So screw those busboys. I almost swear that having a loser job like that in Vegas makes more money than a professional lawyer or doctor in some small states nobody cares about like Wyoming, Arkansas, or the north part of California.
Whatever. Anyways, (-_-) I made sure all I ate was the expensive stuff. I skipped soup and salad. Who cares for that crap at a buffet? I don't even know why people load up on lettuce and clam chowder when there are delicacies like snow crab legs, shrimp cocktail, kobe-style filet-mignon, and paella Valencia waiting for them. If you're going to eat salad bar items, there is no need for you to come here. Just pay $4 and go across the street to McDonald's and get a salad shaker.
Have you ever seen a ghetto person at an expensive buffet? Hahaha, that was me at the Bellagio. I wasn't being rude and annoying or anything like that, but people could tell that I come from the other side of town, from Southern California. You can spot a ghetto person at a buffet by seeing the mountain of food on his\/her plate while coming back from the buffet line, like he\/she will never eat like that again. Or how about the ghetto people who come at the end of lunch hour to pay the reduced price and stay until dinner?

I've been to the Bellagio Buffet plenty times for dinner but never came for brunch until recently.  The bf and I went at the wrong time (noon basically) and it was so packed.  We waited a good while but I tried to keep telling myself it's worth it and it was.  The champagne with the brunch was a little over 30 bucks each which wasn't so bad.  Champagne wasn't that great but it was bottomless.  I recommend asking for orange juice to make a mimosa out of your champagne otherwise it's not so great by itself.  On to the food...

THREE WORDS...honey baked bacon...when you go to vegas you don't go on a diet and well...this was total gluttony but pretty good.  Other magical items:
Prime Rib--juicy and great with the creamy horseradish
Creamy Polenta--I'm a sucker for polenta and this was very good...creamy cheesy goodness
Blue Cheese Pasta--this is an amazing dish if you love cheese.  Rich and awesome
Baked Halibut--amazingly tasted like butter. 

There's so much more I tried but those were the winners for me.  I must admit there's better things for dinner here but brunch wasn't so bad.

Usual stuff like the omelet station was available, though for that coin I'd have liked to see more high-end stuff.

There's literally nothing a vegetarian can eat except fruit and salad. Even the waffles and pancakes have animal products in them. 

As a vegetarian I ate the salad bar, which was decent and deserving of a 2nd star. The miso soup was disgusting and my boyfriend said the pancakes were gross. For $12.99 you can get unlimited mimosas, bloody Mary's and margaritas. Keep in mind the alcohol they use in these is cheap and will leave you feeling not so hot after. The orange juice used tasted like minute maid. The food doesn't seem to be quality either. 

We had pretty decent service except for the lady at the fruit bar who couldn't seem to understand that I wanted mixed berries despite the fact I told her 4 times.

We got to the front, paid the 22 dollars and got quickly seated.  Server promptly took our order and we were off to the races.

The carver stations had st. louis ribs and flank steak which were both pretty good.  And those were the only two redeeming dishes at the buffet.  We tried the spicy tuna handroll and it was packed with red pepper flakes which didn't go over so well.  The selection was really lacking (in comparison to the new buffets on the block like Wicked Spoon and Caesar's).  For sushi, there was only the tuna handrolls, a veggie roll and a california roll.

Must-try food:
Alaskan King crab leg - this is the #1 reason my husband and I came here. We tried the same crab leg in Bacchanal buffet at Caesars Palace. Trust me, the Bellagio ones are bigger and much lumpier in meat. Also, the Bellagio's is COLD crab leg, while the Bacchanal's is WARM crab leg.
Prime rib - cooked medium well, just the right amount for the meat to stay tender and juicy. For the price rib, they serve 2 choices: regular beef prime rib and wagyu beef. To be honest, I like the regular prime rib. Can't even tell if the other one is wagyu because there's not enough marbling to convince me it's wagyu. 
Pork rib - Juicy and tender, with right amount of Asian sweetness
Ahi poke - right amount of heat, dip it in wasabi + soy sauce
Rock cod - melts in your mouth

Skipped food, so don't know how to judge:
All pizzas and pastas
All salad

As for the dessert, I was very disappointed. The desserts was lacking in selection and it lacks creativity. Mostly just small piece of tarts and tiramisu, boring old creme brulee, bread pudding, and flan. The only dessert that I truly enjoyed was the eclair.

Buffet.

Ever.

Very Clean.  Huge selection of every type of cuisine and food that the average brain typically imagines in their dreams.  

Top notch quality.  The coffee is out of this world (I asked the name of it and was told it comes in liquid form\/concentrated, and not in bean form because it's ""more fresh"" when it's in liquid form) - whatever all of that means.. I don't care because it was just incredible (although I do prefer beans to ""liquid concentration"", just because it sounds less artificial, even though the liquid probably isn't artificial anyway).  

I've had both the breakfast and the dinner, but I'm reviewing the breakfast\/brunch right now since I just had it yesterday.

Eggs Benedict in immaculate formation and flavor.

Omelette Bar: yes, all buffets have them but you can taste the fresh here.  And it's gigantic.  

French toast made in front of you.

Fluffy pancakes.

Bacon, carved to order.  I kid you not.  Who even knew bacon came in a giant slab, anyway? :-b   

Blintzes. 

Mini waffles..omghwehghahfklhjsljgs I loved these. Added cinnamon (they keep the powdered cinnamon in a bowl, not a shaker.. so you can really glob it on like I did), walnuts, pecans, shredded coconut, and then drizzled with honey.. yummies.   

Vegetables, salads, sushi, fruits.  Everything fresh and ripe and beautifully displayed.

Pastries.  Chocolate filled eclair.  I fainted into bliss after the first one.  I grabbed a second one to go and bit into as I walked out the door (the people waiting in line did not look happy at my display of pastry tease).  They have tiramisu, cheesecake, key lime pie, cookies, carrot cake, brownies, frozen yogurt... but I repeat:  Everything tastes better here than at other buffets.  Culinary perfection!  The pastries are all mini sized, so it gives you a good opportunity to try several.

Someone else said that they're amazed how the food stays at the perfect ""doneness"", even though under a heat lamp.  DITTO!  Not sure how they do this, other than not cooking some things all the way through, but it's something other buffets should spy on.

I tried the Bellagio buffet a couple Vegas trips back (about a year ago) and all of my friends thought it was alright, we were more excited about leaving to watch the water show.  The next day, we went to Rio and regretted even wasting our money at the Bellagio buffet.

Since that time, I've heard so many good reviews about the place.  My boyfriend told me it was on Food Network for its fine selection of fresh meat!  So two Vegas trips ago, I willingly went with my friends to give Bellagio buffet another try.

It was Memorial Day weekend so prices were more expensive, however I can't remember exactly how much because my boyfriend paid.  We came around 3pm for a late lunch so we could stay until dinner ;P  When I walked in, I thought ""maybe I was wrong about this place"".  I was so excited to dig into everything they had because everything looked so good and there were so many selections!!

However, for me, it was all looks.  I probably grabbed about 3 full plates piled with food and two plates of dessert (one for fruit).  My favorite was the dessert (as always).  I didn't finish any of my 3 plates and wouldn't have been able to even if I forced myself to.  To get a better picture of the food, the BREAKFAST BACON was my favorite item -_-  because it was so crunchy.  Maybe the pesto mashed potatoes were high on my list.  The meat was disappointing, considering it was raved about on Food Network.  The pasta was good but my favorite was rotated out before I could get seconds =(  OH YEAH, and the sushi sucked!!!!!  I couldn't even swallow my first piece.

For dessert, I grabbed a bunch of different pastries that looked pretty.  I'm used to pretty looking dessert that tasted mediocre.  However, their fruit tarts were yummy from top to bottom!  The crust had a nice texture, the creme wasn't too sweet or too bland and the strawberries had dark chocolate sprinkles on top!  It was heaven, I tell ya.  Then I found chocolate dipped strawberries!!  The thing was: they were half milk chocolate and half white chocolate!  And the strawberries were huge!!!!

Das Buffet im Bellagio unterscheidet sich hier ebenfalls nicht. Wir waren hier zum Frühstück und konnten feststellen, dass das Angebot schon vergleichsweise reichhaltig und frisch ist. Die typischen Amerikanischen Frühstücksgewohnheiten lassen sich hier ohne Probleme befriedigen, wer es etwas mehr nach ""exotisch"" möchte findet zumindest diverse Frühstücksflocken, eine Omelett Bar und reichlich Obst und Früchte. Das Gast bedient sich inzwischen selbst, auch bei den Getränken. Die Auslagen wurden während unseres Aufenthaltes regelmässig bestückt und die Servicekraft besuchte uns auch regelmässig am Tisch um das überflüssige Geschirr abzuräumen. Die Qualität der Lebensmittel ging in Ordnung, ich persönlich sehe nur den recht hohen Preis für meinen Nahrungsmittelbedarf nicht ganz gerechtfertigt.

We went on a Sat night where it was supposed to be ""gourmet"" night with more selections. It was a pricey buffet, at $77 for both of us. The line was insane. It wrapped around most of the casino. What was horrible about it, was that the buffet on a SAT night, in Las Vegas, closes @10pm. We waited (along with about 100 people behind us) for over an hour to get to the cashier to pay. By that time, it was 9:40pm. I was sure my info was incorrect and the staff would tell me they were open to at least 11. I asked the cashier and she said ""No we close @10"". I said, you are telling me, that I have 20 minutes to inhale my food for $77??"" She said the buffet closes at 10, but they dont put the food away till 10:30, so run around like a nut doing supermarket sweep and fill as many dishes as possible and sit and eat at your table.. I was going to leave, but then I thought I wasted SO MUCH TIME waiting to eat here, and in thinking of my fellow yelpers, I wanted to add my honest review to this site, so I stayed. I also told the staff that they need to have a staff member block off the line, or have a sign there that says ""No entry after this point"", or no entry after 9pm, because all those poor people behind us, who also waited 11\/2 to 2 hours to eat would be kicked off the line when it closed @10. Not nice to have people there wasting their time in Vegas when there are 1000000000 other places they could be eating.
The food was not impressive. They had awful, runny,  split crab legs, sub-par sushi, very tough meat (I had a few different piece of lamb), God awful Chilean sea bass, which is one of my fav dishes, so that was even more disappointing, I also tried the elk and ostrich because it was there. But it was too gamey for me. The lobster ravioli was good, as were the hand rolls. But certainly not worth the wait or the price. You can get the crab legs in almost every other buffet in Vegas. 
We were also SO SICK after we finished eating! The food went right through us both. We joked about having a $77 laxative. 
Mirage buffet stood out- it had many different sections and offerings. AND- if you LOVE seafood, do yourself a favor and hit the Rio seafood buffet. (There's a free shuttle from the Paris hotel.)  That buffet is in a class by itself. Please see my review. I would not return or recommend the Bellagio buffet. I guess if this was the only buffet you hit in Vegas, you might be impressed. Having been here on vacation before in LV, I have seen way nicer spreads for less $. On an upnote, the hotel itself is gorgeous, and def worth a look in the flower conservatory or see the world's largest chocolate fountain. Good gelato and desserts there.

************UPDATE**********
I was so annoyed by my buffet experience that I sent part of this review to Bellagio, hoping they would re vamp their line set up, as to not leave customers out in the lurch with no dinner or food they had to pay $77 for and then scarf down because they close at 10pm. Shockingly to me- the manager called me (now that Im back in Nyc) and offered to comp me 2 tickets to eat there again (which I quickly told him I never would- even for free), or get a refund. So I told him to refund our credit card, and they complied. I was very appreciative of this gesture, but I honestly hope they #1 Improve the food there, and #2 Fix the line set up.",1,0,1

Out of all the Las Vegas eateries, I've probably eaten here the most, both for brunch and for dinner.  This is one place where you can definitely eat more than what you're paying for.  But even then, is it really worth it?

Some of the meats, for instance, are pretty disappointing.  By the time you get your small medallion sized cut of prime rib, roast beef, kobe beef, venison, or other protein back to your table, it's cold.  And if you ask for a second slice, they always carve it thinner than the first.

The deserts are no different.  Thankfully, they're small, so the ones that aren't a hit, you can brush aside and not feel so bad about it.  You're better off stopping by by Jean Philippe Patisserie around the corner.

On the other hand, the made to order omelets are pretty awesome. The line is never too long, and you can throw in a lot of different toppings. The pizza, thin crust, also with a variety of different toppings, is also surprisingly good.  I always save room for two small slices.

If you're comped or got a line pass, why the hell not.  But with the ever growing number of world-class food options in Vegas where every other celebrity chef has a restaurant, why pay to overstuff yourself with mediocre food?",2,0,2

Well, after grazing dozens of of other buffets (when did they stop being called smorgasbords?) throughout my life I made it to this one last week.Was it the best ever? Nope. It came in second place (first goes to Wheeling Island Casino in West Virginia). But second out of some 50 to 60 buffets is pretty good.

This buffet did all the regular fare that any buffet should do. You know, the ice cream machine, the heaping helpings of shrimp cocktails, the fresh baked breads, the carving stations and the Asian fusion station and pizza platters for the kids (why they're at a casino in Las Vegas I'll never understand, but I digress).

What sets this buffet apart is the extras. The extra selections you don't find elsewhere and the extra steps on the items you expect.

This is the only place I've ever had Steak Tartar at a buffet. The ""peeled and deveined"" shrimp, the Ahi salads, the fresh sushi and a very nice nicoise salad are examples of items that are rare at any buffet but fit in well here. The carving station had Prime Rib that seemed to alternate between Medium Rare and Medium Well with each new roast they brought to the board. A very nice touch. The leg of lamb was very well prepared as well. Also, all the usual accoutrement were available, such as fresh au jus, horseradish sauce, milled mustard and mint jellies. 

The King Crab Legs were a nice size and pre-split but I was somewhat disappointed that they were served cold. Drawn butter was available but it's still not the same, you know?

Though it was a small item I raved about the soft pretzel rolls on the bread bar. A small round puff of Philadelphia soft pretzel flavor was simply the best bread I've ever had. Somehow I kept nibbling on this item all night long.;)

As is the case with every buffet (and I mean every one) the dessert course was easily the least impressive. With 5 of us at the table we managed to get a sample of every dessert offered and only 3 items got a thumbs up from the table mates. My favorite was the chocolate raspberry cone but others liked the key lime tort and chocolate mousse cake.

Being close to NYE and all, we had no dinner reservations and as a last resort, came to The Buffet.  

It's $10 less than Bacchanal but if I had a choice, I seriously would have given even an extra $15-20 to get into Bacchanal because this was a big mistake (I was at Bacchanal last year).  It is 1\/3 the size of Bacchanal and the variety of food is lacking.  

There are crab legs and you see a lot of people piling it onto their plates (to the point where a whole chain of people are lining up and the people who lack any consideration are still piling it onto their plates).  I tried some and they're seriously not worth the hype that these people make it out to.  They were much too salty and lacked crisp freshness (but they weren't unfresh either).  

The only good thing they had was prime rib with their kalbi sauce.  Their salmon fillet was also not bad.  However, everything else lacked a wow factor.  It was like any other buffet I've been to.  The desserts weren't good either.  

So now that I've been to both Bacchanal and The Buffet, which one would I pick?  Definitely Bacchanal wins.  Bellagio seriously needs to vamp up and get their act together and improve on their buffet because Bacchanal is seriously stealing their thunder.  Big time.

Just about everything I had was very good but still tasted like any other buffet I've had in Vegas. Which reminds me of a conversation I had with a taxi driver a few years ago. The driver said that the reason why most buffets in Vegas taste the same is that they buy their food from the same commissary...sort of like a Costco for hotels.  They just reheat it and add more dishes to make theirs different.  I don't know if that's true or not...but makes you wonder. BTW, the crab legs are served chilled..no hot crab in sight. The crab we got after our first batch was being served partially frozen which I did not care for...probably because they couldn't replenish it fast enough.

When I got back to the table and ate it I didn't realize that it was bad until I felt a weird sound in my stomach and I said something to my husband and all of a sudden I could not control myself and I actually vomited at the table I didn't even have time to excuse myself it just came up. 

The people around me were aghast
I've never seen someone vomit in a restaurant on the table but it was pretty dramatic
My husband grabbed the plate and said you I believe it's that
The waitress Busser and manager came to the table asking if I was OK
I told the manager to smell the beef Wellington and he refused
It made me extremely angry that the manager refused to smell would had obviously made me sick

It had a rotten smell. 
I was absolutely shocked I grabbed my purse I was so humiliated and embarrassed that I walked out my husband stood there talking to the manager as I just left and went back to our room. 
I never ate or recommended the buffet at the Bellagio ever again
I am not a buffet type person but the Wynn was much better",6,6,2

The wait was over 45 minutes, but thanks to another reviewer, we read that smaller parties can sit at the bar and jump the line. Just ask the hostess to check for you. Our entire meal lasted almost 2 hours and we were the only two people sitting there so we got to know our bartender and had a great time. 

We went here for dinner and even though it's over $40 per person for dinner, it's cheaper than two people eating at any of the high end restaurants in the Casino.

Mini creme brulee, eclairs, tiramisu, soft serve ice cream, Frangelico cups, macaroons, carrot cake, etc The dessert bar at Ceasar's is definitely larger, but the Bellagio's was still impressive and everything on it was great.

I've eaten at the Bellagio buffet over a dozen times in the past, all werrre good.  But this trip, it was terrible.  I was in town on biz and took my boss.  

The shrimp was hard.  Not frozen, just hard.  2 kinds of sushi.  Empty pans and platters that were picked clean when we got there and never replenished for the hour we spent.  Theirslider burgers, which I like.. they had 4 trays of turkey depsite the signs that said ""beef sliders"".  I asked, ""where are the beef ones?""  The man said they were all turkey.  I said I know, and pointed to the signs.  He said, ""I'll take care of it sir"".   2 minutes later I went back, 4 trays of OLD turkey sliders still there... and he removed the signs!   That was his solution.  Those same sliders were under the lights for an hour, no one was eating them.  Yet, there they stayed.

It was the worst buffet experience ever in Vegas.  My boss had the salmon, he said it tasted like nasty ham.

We mentioned this to the waitress.  She told us other people were complaining too.  I asked the manager for our money back.  She obliged.  That was that.

Yes I know anyone can have a bad day.  But the whole buffet was bad, except the carving station.  That was OK.  Would I return?  Unlikely I'd go through the effort to give it another shot.

-The prime rib: flavorful and juicy
-The sirloin: kinda bland, a little dry
-The roasted turkey: unusually moist
-The pesto mashed potatoes: yummy
-The various roasted veggies: passable

My husband liked:
-The bluenose: tender and well-complemented by the sauce

-The spicy hunan chicken: excellent

Everything was GOOD.  I knocked off one star because nothing was exceptionally memorable.  The food is solid across the board, but there wasn't anything that stood out to me as wildly spectacular.  

Here are a couple of delicious items that I did really like:
+ Chilean sea bass = AMAZING.  I grew up on Chilean sea bass, and this is some of the best I've ever had.  YUM.
+ The desserts are all stand-out.  I especially liked the fruit tart with the giant strawberry on top.  Very good.
+ The cheese selection was good too.

Overall, a wide variety of seafood items, carved meats, hot entrees, appetizers, cheese selections, fruits, salads, and, of course, desserts.  I won't go into detail here, but I thought everything was pretty high-quality, and you're getting what you paid for.  It's a more expensive buffet, but that's because the selection is extensive, classy, and delicious.  

The other buffet I went to this time around was the Buffet at the Wynn.  I think if you're looking into this one or Wynn's, I would choose Wynn because Wynn had many more stand-out items (in my opinion) than Bellagio (I go into detail in my Wynn review).  

So, in conclusion: 4 stars for all-around tastiness, minus a star because I had to rack my brain to even remember the stand-out dishes.  It's a small complaint, but one that I thought I'd mention.  For a buffet, though, it doesn't disappoint!",0,0,0

The line actually moved along quickly and as I got closer to the cashiers, its really the cashiers that work slow and carry out the line, not the actual wait to get seated because there's unlimited seats inside! 

We got settled in and paid 25 a person for brunch and skipped over for another 5 dollars unlimited champagne. The food selection was minimal, with most of the emphasis on breakfast food. Had everything from waffles to mash potatoes to eggs benedict and bagels and everything else one could think of for brunch! I felt the variety of food that caters for a buffet was short and wasn't worth the money. 

However they did have prime rib, which was chewy and medium rare. Very thinly sliced but it was certainly unlimited! 

Perhaps it was bad timing or just Sunday, but it certainly wasn't worth the wait especially for my birthday. It wasn't a full meal perhaps the Aria buffet would have been a slightly better choice.",1,2,1

When I go, I always have what I call ""The Noah's Ark"" - as you can imagine, this is where I put two of every animal in my belly. 

Bellagio is one of my favorite Buffets. I like Treasure Island and Mirage buffets as well - wasn't too keen on Aria's. Some of the best buffets can be had outside of the strip, but we're here to talk about Bellagio...

This casino is beautiful - the walk to get the the buffet is pleasant - we usually travel past the garden that they change seasonally. It's touristy, but it sets the mood. I also appreciate that the Bellagio casino doesn't smell as overwhelming of old lady perfume and cigarette smoke as others on the strip.

The line for this is INSANE if you show up during peak hours - here's a tip - after you check out, have your hotel hang on to your bags and get some shopping done or have a nice walk before heading over there. If you go between 10 and 2, you're waiting at least an hour. 

Either that or bump your mlife card up to a pearl or higher to cut the line. Gamble, gamble gamble...

Half the time I""ve been here, it's been amazing - 5 star all the way... the other times, it has been merely a 3 star experience. Mirage is more reliable, but not as good when both are at their best.

Once we got to cashier, I was in shock to hear how much an individual had to pay for buffet dinner. For the price for an individual had to pay, we could've got the 24 hour buffet pass. More buffets to visit at different hotels.

1) VALUE. For ~$33 during dinner time for a buffet with seafood, this is a pretty good deal. For the two of us during a weekday dinner, we paid roughly $75 total. Now compare this to the Ceasers, who charges about $60 per person. We aren't the wealthiest people, so we stuck to what was the more realistic option for us. I must say, it was a gamble because paying $33 for subpar seafood would have been awful. Luckily, their seafood rocked!

2) SALMON & TUNA NIGIRI. They had the freshest salmon and tuna nigiri- so juicy and thick. It doesn't even matter if they 'pack the rice' in the nigiri because you can just make it into the sashimi by setting aside the rice. They also have salmon and tuna poke (cubes of marinated salmon & tuna)

3) KING CRAB LEGS. Keep an eye out for those king crab legs. They also have regular snow crab legs, but the king crab legs have so much meat and just taste so much better. Both crab legs were always fully stocked. They cut the crab legs in half so it is easier to eat. I appreciated that! The melted butter is located in the soup section. It took us a few minutes to locate it. 

4) MEAT. They had the Kobe cuts available that I found to be very tasty. I complemented the dish with their mashed potatoes and asparagus. No other pairings needed! 

5) DESSERT. Holy moly, their dessert really topped off this meal just right for us. Their chocolate dome thing, coffee tiramisu, creme brulee, fruit tart, and ice cream with cookie were all so delightful. Order a tea or coffee to top off the experience. 

I wouldn't give 5 because everything outside of the list above was not that great. They had some hot Asian dishes with rice and Chicken tiki masala, but they just weren't that tasty.

They had split, grilled lobster tails, rack of lamb, and some other dishes not typically offered. I'm not a lobster person, or lamb for that matter, but my BF was super stoked. The price was more expensive and they advised they only offer lobster during New Years and Chinese New Year.  The salad bar was a bit small, but offered different types of lettuces, and typical salad toppings. There was an additional smaller salad\/appetizer area with shrimp caesar salad, and another as well, but I forgot what kind. This station also offered a antipasta selection of meats, cheeses, olives, peppers, etc. There was real shaved parmesan there as well. The meat station was crowded because that's where they were doing the lobster tails and everyone was hovered around trying to get one.  I had the cauliflower au gratin which was excellent! BF is not much of a vegetable eater, but he loved it so maybe this is something we can incorporate into our meals at home. Also had grilled asparagus, carved turkey w\/ cranberry sauce which was actually quite dry. I think maybe they need to leave a hunk of skin over the already cut piece of turkey to keep it somewhat moist.  Fingerling roasted potatoes were good, and trying to get to the Asian foods and Pizza areas, I was distracted by the desserts, so I really didn't see too much, but I remember a small sushi area offering nigiri and rolls, typical asian inspired cuisine like chow mein, fried and steamed rice, and chicken\/broccoli\/seafood dishes. Now, the dessert cart..YUM!  I had a chocolate vanilla dome cake which was to die for!  It looked like cocoa powder was dusted over a dome, but it was actually cake!  A really thin layer of chocolate cake (think mocha in color), with a vanilla chocolate mousse inside that was so creamy!  I wanted like 6 of them, but they slyly put them on little square plates making it hard to actually take that many! lol   I also had a piece of tiramisu which was equally good and creamy.

The Sunday champagne brunch was comparable to the Wynn dinner I had over a year ago, the Spice Market dinner (also over a year ago), and the Mirage lunch I had two days before. There is nothing here to piss yourself over. It is more expensive than the Mirage lunch buffet, and there isn't as much variety as one would have hoped for. 

Shrimp cocktail = also at the Mirage lunch buffet.
Prime rib = also at the Mirage lunch buffet, and about the same, if not worse.
Chilean sea bass = eh.

I just don't see what the big deal is. The unlimited champagne, which you pay an extra $5 for, is the only difference. They are not lazy about refilling the champagne, and our server was really attentive and nice. She even filled us up one last time before we left, so we walked out with a full champagne flute on our way to gamble.

French food is what they say this place is about. Although I do not eat any kind of seafood I have to say they have the best selection of crab. They had the Alaskan King crab and the snow crab in buckets! This place is like crab heaven if you like crab. They have melted butter that you can scoop up to your hearts content and they have champagne in a glass now not in those cheapy plastic containers they do in other casinos. I like the salad selection and of course the choices in bread. I do not eat bread although I love bread because of the high carb content but enough about that. The bread had to be tried! It was delicious, and they had real butter on the side. Soft butter, not the frozen kind. The butter was at room temperature so it was easy to spread it on your bread. Yum! 

Alright downside to this place is you have to be ready to wait. It felt like a line at Disneyland to get into one of those rides! The line was long! We waited 75 minutes to be seated and we stayed for 2 hours inside. Prepare to wait folks.

We came for supper, but we came on a weekday and early (around 4:30) to avoid the line. And boy are we glad... by the time we left, which was just past 7, there was a line that went out to the entrance of the buffet already! 

It's not the most expensive buffet, supper cost about 37 dollars, which is pretty decent, considering how expensive things are on the strip. (Literally, one banana was selling for 1$ each at Walgreens... so much for trying to be healthy) 
The food is pretty good too, there are snow crab legs (which were awesome), Kobe beef (YUMMMM), Sushi and Tuna or Salmon Poke (drools), and a variety of other things. The variety doesn't quite beat Bacchanal, but I think the quality may have been ever so slightly better... that or I just liked their crab more hahaha. The pasta was pretty unimpressive, but come on, nobody goes to a buffet for pasta... 

The only complaint that I have is that their dessert table is a bit small compared to the other places... and they don't have a gelato bar! They do have 2 machines that are self served soft serve ice creams\/sorbets, but it's nothing like standing behind the glass of the gelato bar staring into the wonderful colours of different flavors of gelato. 

The other desserts are actually pretty good, though by that time I was already up to my ears in food... so it makes it a little harder to appreciate

King crab is about $30 dollar a pound so just keep that in mind. Most buffets serve snow crab which is NOT nearly as expensive. There is also salmon\/tuna poke and salmon nigiri!

The dessert selection is great too! So many different things to try and they're all adorably plated too. If you've already gone to Carnival at Rio, Wicked Spoon, and Bacchanal, I highly recommend this place! 

Many people complain about the long wait times, but EVERY buffet in Vegas is going to have a similar 2-3 hour wait time, so I completely disregarded that in my review because I find it to be irrelevant. My review is solely based on food quality and price. However,  I do recommend coming around 4:30 to get in line because it can get pretty bad at 6pm.

From gourmet buffets to your average station casino, on top of my parents being such avid gamblers, there isn't a casino buffet I'm not familiar with until this place.

Front: We came here close to 6pm on a saturday just before the rush of people wanting to get dinner and thankfully we planned it this way.  The wait in line probably only took 10 minutes and was prompted a place to sit (party of 4) immediately while a bigger group in front of us had to wait. 

Price:
Breakfast: $18.99 (Mon-Fri\/ 7am-11am
Lunch: $22.99 (11am-330pm)
Dinner: $33.99 (Mon-Thur 330-1000)
Gourmet dinner: $39.99 (Fri-Sat\/330-1000)

Food:
Now like all buffets in Vegas, they love to prepare dishes from around the world.  This place was no different as they feature primarily Asian, American, Italian and Mexican. The food here ladies and gentlemen probably the best buffet food i've had (yes, better than the M and better than GVR's feast).  They had chicken tikka masala that was pretty consistent in terms of flavor and was nicely tender.  They had pesto mashed potatoes and pesto shrimp pizza, both of which were perfect.  They feature snow crabs like any other buffet but also offer king crab (only drawback is that you can't get them steamed, they're all served cold.) A sushi bar next to the crabs that serve your basic rolls and nigiri, tuna\/salmon poke (with spicy mayo on the side) and they serve american caviar, other eggs and steak tartar (GET THE TARTAR!!!).  Rack of lamb was also served which was prepared wonderfully without too much of that lamby\/gamey taste.

Dessert: 
The blueberry, strawberry and chocolate raspberry macaron.  I strongly recommend getting this to end your experience.  Its just a nice touch of sweetness without being too overpowered in terms of richness to clean  your palette alongside the refreshing feeling of the fruits. 

Interior: This buffet is very intimate, meaning that its walkways in the buffet are narrow and you'll be bumping into plenty of people.  Decor is dated but the food makes up for that.  There is a bathroom located inside the buffet so no more having to leave and asking the cocktail waitresses where the bathrooms are; however, the mens room has like 2 urinals and 1 stall so you'll probably end up pooping elsewhere. 

Overall: 
This buffet is probably the best buffet i've had.  GVR used to rank supreme when they would marinate the crabs and shrimp in that special blend of spices and herbs but they have since eliminated that.  A bit on the pricier side as we went during the gourmet buffet but with your choices of rack of lamb, king crab, steak tartar and other premium food choices (plus being on the strip) the price is reasonable. If the crabs were steamed and the walkways were more wider, I would definitely give this place a 5.",7,2,4

I'm a medium-rare kind of person and was really happy with how it was cooked, but if you're an idiot who wants it well done, they'll fry it up for you too.

Pros: 
1. servers\/employees friendly and attentive

1. Price because kids don't eat much, just pizza. And I paid for two to just have 1 slice of cheese pizza. They had nothing much for kids. Go for Aria cuz kids under 12 are free! And variety and flavor was so much better. 
2. Besides from the usual crab legs that everyone goes for (which I didn't eat) the food had No flavor in any foods. It was just bland. Nothing that I wanted to say ""oh this is amazing!!"" And never went for seconds on anything. Food was very basic! No creativity!! Seriously, mash potatoes and gravy?! BBQ chicken (that's the only chicken dish besides rotisserie, and all they did was slather BBQ sauce on it) beef brisket, Green beans, plain mushrooms, plain corn on the cob, chicken noodle soup, cheese, pepperoni\/veggie pizzas, cheese pasta? Mac and cheese? It seemed all like cafeteria sort of foods. Normal Sushi rolls that you can get at any grocery store?! The salad was just a salad bar with 3 types of lettuce and toppings?!

If I go to a buffet on the strip I always go to the W\/ynn and I am NEVER disappointed.  The long lines are what usually deter me and tonight I would have waited for two days to eat at the Wynn rather than waiting to eat at The Buffet at Bellagio.  

I had read mixed reviews from my Yelp friends and since we had some out of town guests we decided to try something different. 

What a mistake. 

The only positive was the short wait in line on a Saturday night it was only 15 minutes. 

The rest of the night pretty much goes downhill from there. 

No stand out service except for a chef at one of the stations who offered us an entree without the sauce.  

Standard generic offerings-nothing creative  

Here's what I saw:  crab legs, prime rib (but I can make a prime rib at home-so not too impressed), mussels, shrimp (no cups for a side offering of the cocktail sauce), salmon, 

Chicken, turkey, beef, pasta, mashed potatoes, 

Asparagus, ravioli, pizza, macaroni and cheese, 

Taco station\/fajita station, sushi, chinese, salads, 

Fruits (but the strawberry's were all gone), 

Desserts were average: Soft serve ice-cream, cheesecake, carrot cake, macarons, nothing nut free-in fact it was the opposite and a sign states that nuts could be in desserts so my youngest could not have anything but ice cream. 

Anyway, Boring, Boring, Boring

I will add that the food was tasty and it gets 4 stars, but my rating goes down due to the lack of cleanliness and creative dishes.

All of the stations were so messy and sloppy and dry crusted on juices everywhere.  

I was really grossed out. 

No one was keeping house or had been for most of the night.

My husband said the men's restroom was dirty and disgusting. 

The seating area where we ate was was wet and food was on it we had to call someone over to clean it. 

The thought of touching every single spoon that a million other people touchedt at the buffet grossed me out.  I can appreciate the individual servings that are offered at Bacchanal, and my goodness Bacchanal's rating will go up after seeing the cluster here.

Just a note: If you go to any buffet carry antiseptic to clean your hands after handling the spoons that hundreds have touched. 

The local Station casino's were much cleaner and presentations much better than what I saw here.  

What a waste of money.  

We will not be back.",13,7,7

I watched a segment on TV a few years ago about the buffet at the Bellagio. It's supposed to be one of the best buffets in Las Vegas. I couldn't wait to indulge on all the different foods!

Atmosphere\/Decor:

The Buffet at Bellagio kind of reminded me of an upscale Hometown Buffet. You would think that the atmosphere and decor would be extravagant since it's located in the Bellagio but it wasn't. The concept and set up of the buffet seemed to go hand and hand. I liked how each food station was specifically focused on a certain cuisine. For example, there was an Asian Food section with nothing but Asian foods. There was also an Italian section, Seafood section, Contemporary American section and of course a dessert section. The setup was very straight forward. I found it very easy to find foods that I liked. The interior design was just mediocre but then again it's a buffet and not an upscale restaurant so what do you expect. The one issue I had with the set up was the restroom. When I went to go use the the restroom I noticed there was only one restroom stall. Everyone knows for a fact that when you are eating at a buffet there are going to be tons of people that will experience bubble guts and will have to drop a super serious deuce in the bathroom. Having only one bathroom stall isn't going to cut it. We ended up sitting at the bar which was pretty nice. 

Food: 

Where do I start. There was a ton of food to choose from. I started out with a Caesar salad, a few pieces of watermelon and fresh sliced cured meats. The Caesar salad was decent. It was kind of soggy but it still tasted pretty good. The watermelon was fresh and tasted good. The cured meats were excellent especially the roasted pork. The roasted pork had so much flavor! For round two, I decided to go with a romaine salad, topped with cheddar cheese, carrots, and ranch dressing. I also got two pieces of pepperoni pizza. For my other plate, I got roasted turkey with turkey gravy, ham, and country potatoes with white gravy. The salad with ranch dressing was excellent. I loved the taste of their ranch dressing. I'm assuming it was made from scratch. The pepperoni pizza was  also very good. The roasted turkey was one of my favorites. I love turkey! The turkey reminded me of a good cooked Thanksgiving Turkey. The turkey was delicious. The turkey gravy had a nice consistency to it and complimented the roasted turkey very well. The ham was very good too. I liked the country potatoes a lot! They had a very nice country flavor to them and the white gravy enhanced the flavor of the potatoes even more. For round three, I decided to eat another romaine salad with ranch dressing, roasted turkey with turkey gravy, beef tenderloins with a pepper corn reduction sauce, mashed potatoes, pureed yams and prime rib. The beef tenderloins were super tender and loaded with flavor. The pepper corn sauce was strong but the meat was cooked perfectly so it didn't matter. The mashed potatoes were spot on perfect! There was nothing wrong with them. They were definitely one of the best mashed potatoes I've ever eaten and reminded me of how my girlfriends mashed potatoes taste. The pureed yams were silky smooth and sweet. The prime rib was sensational! The meat was cooked perfect to a medium rare and had so so so much flavor. There was a perfect meat to fat ratio. The prime rib was probably my favorite and the highlight of the buffet. For round four, I decided to eat another slice of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn beef and hash, pineapple fried rice and a teriyaki chicken skewer. The corn beef and hash was okay. I'm used to the corn beef from a can. The meat and potatoes were shredded. The pineapple fried rice and teriyaki chicken skewer was really good. I liked the fried rice because it had chunks of pineapple in it. Pineapple is my favorite fruit and I love fried rice! The chicken skewer was very tender and the teriyaki sauce had a nice sweet flavor. For round five, I decided to go with another slice of prime rib, teriyaki chicken skewer, bowl of jasmine white rice and some more mashed potatoes. Everything tasted great! For my final round, I got a few slices of watermelon and fresh strawberries. 

Service: 

My girlfriend and I thought the service was great. She ordered the unlimited bloody marys and every time she finished one, the bartender promptly made her a new one. Our waters were always topped off without us even asking for a refill. The two gentlemen working at the bar were very polite and personable. 

Overall: 

The Buffet at Bellagio is great! The food was excellent! The buffet line can get pretty long and the wait could exceed over an hour. I'd definitely recommend sitting at the bar so you can avoid waiting for over an hour. I know there are many buffets in Vegas, but you will definitely get the best bang for your buck at Bellagio!",4,3,1

There is a huge variety, but unless you're seeking a meal where you're over stuffed, it's not worth the money.

Our vacation stay at the Bellagio came with a daily credit for the buffet, which is why we came here at least once a day for dinner or brunch.  After one meal here, we kind of wished we didn't have the credit.  It would have been better just to try a larger number of different cafes and restaurants.  I suppose we could have just not used the credit, but we are savers and way too conditioned not to pass that up!

Here's what we saw\/ate:

- pickled herring
- seafood salad with ...apple slices? is that what I'm tasting?
- green bean salad with mussels
- bacon, eggs, corned beef hash
- taco station
- mountain of chilled shrimp (shrimp cocktail)
- fresh fruits, smoked salmon, hard boiled eggs
- fantastic dessert selection: carrot cake, apple pie, fudge brownies, soft serve
- tortilla soup and corn chowder 
- fresh cut of prime rib and turkey with warm, chunky cranberry sauce
- seaweed salad and california rolls

Our favorites:

- corn chowder--hearty, flavorful, hint of sweetness
- prime rib-- flavorful, juicy, hot 
- turkey-- also flavorful, tender, fantastic job with the cranberry sauce (not out of a can)
- light seafood\/green bean salads. Kale, quinoa, etc. were some of the ingredients used.
- shrimp cocktail-- robust, cold, crunchy.

Everything from your craving to what goes on in the actual restaurant is probably a good time. Not so much afterwards. But enjoy it while it lasts. But don't let it last too long or you'll be punished in the gym for it.

While I understand that the Bellagio is a world renown hotel and arguably the top resort on the Strip, I don't know if I can make the same call for this Buffet. 

For one, don't let the long lines deceive you into believing that you're going to be eating some luxury food. The decor resembles the buffet of a Station Casino.

I would give the food 4\/5 stars and that's actually pretty nice because I'm still hesitant about the quality of the food. They had the Beef Wellington, in which I have never seen from any other hotel buffet. While that is certainly a unique thing for this buffet, it tasted terrible. The seafood was average to above average. The crab legs were good but even when I asked them to steam em up, they were a bit rude to me AND did a very mediocre job in heating them up. Other than that, all your other foods are like your standard foods that you will find at your nearest resort buffet.

Service was decent. Except all the cooks seemed so bitter, rude and old. Maybe it's explained by their age but I'm certainly in no position to blame their lack of customer service due to age. But being that this hotel is a part of the mega resort Bellagio, their customer service level standards should certainly be in the skies.

I paid about 88 for two because it was a holiday which is typical on special occasions. But to be perfectly honest, I don't see myself coming back here for full price. Half off would do the trick though.",1,1,1

Just like the Asian cheapasses we are, we came right before the breakfast changeover into lunch so we paid $19.99 for breakfast vs. $21.99 for lunch.

For the breakfast items, it was all the predictable things. The standouts were eggs benedict and pesto grilled tomato. The hollandaise on the benedict actually had tang like it's supposed to. The tomato had a thin crunchy panko topping.

They started changing out the brekkie stuff way before 11am.  It took about 30 mins until it was all changed over, with many lunch items still covered in plastic with no serving utensils until many minutes later.

So second plate consisted of cold seafood salads. Lots of shrimp and calamari, some green lip mussels, and none of them were that great. Shrimp were kinda powdery, calamari was chewy.

Third plate, still no lunch food put out yet, so I get some cold cuts and smoked salmon. The salmon was in the exact place as the cold seafood salads, yet it was there and gone in an instant and never replaced. No cream cheese anywhere, not even by the bagels.

Fourth plate, now they have some lunch stuff out. Got some salmon and non descript white fish (thankfully not tilapia bc that stuff is vile). Creamy polenta and asparagus, warm mussels (the cold ones were better). And some shrimp\/pork wonton woup. Fish was tasteless and gross. Polenta was the best I had all meal. Wontons were great but not what I excepted to be the best from the Asian section, which was severely lacking.

Plate five. Skirt steak OMG nice pink in the center but also a huge sinew in there too. Inedible and also not seasoned enough. Spring roll was gross and oily on the outside. Sushi: only offer CA rolls or veggie rolls. 

Last plate. Giving up, getting dessert. Large strawberries is a plus. Also with watermelon and honeydew, but I don't get that gross cantaloupe. The fruit tarts were good, with the cream not too sweet, but the Napolean was way too sweet and the layers not flaky. Flan was great.

Overall, the ONLY thing I went back for seconds or thirds was the polenta. I know how much butter and calories is in there though! Everything else was meh or spit out gross.

Bf had brisket, turkey and ribs. All practically inedible.

Asian section severly lacking.

Bottlenecks aka cluster****s at every station.

No crab legs at lunch (Aria has them for same price).

And therein lies the problem. I just don't think Eggs Benedict should be lumped by the dozen in a chafing dish or French Toast wedges getting arid as the Sahara under heat lamps. In fact, everything had that warmed-over, slightly mushy texture that never quite satisfies but somehow satiates because you'll be damned not to get your thirty-dollars' worth of food. One thing I have no complaints about is the service. The army of waitresses is at the ready refilling coffee cups and juice glasses and picking up the dirty dishes.

Came here for Sunday brunch. The brunch was delicious. Breakfast here is great. The pancakes are made fresh, the french toast is made fresh. They were very moist and tasted so good. Usually the french toast and pancakes are pretty dry at the buffets. The even had maple honey bacon freshly sliced. The prime rib was juicy and flavorful. They had a good salad bar, although I'm not a big fan of salads at a buffet. I just go straight for the good stuff. The fruit here was sweet. The desserts were ok. Not as good as what I've read. But I'm sure the desserts are better in the dinner buffets. They were still good. But I didn't see any creme brulee or manans foster for Sunday brunch.

We got there around 10:00 for brunch and the line wasn't to bad. We waited in line for about a half hour. Champagne was available for and extra charge which was kind of nice because champagne is usually included in the price which means you would pay more for your buffet even if you don't drink champagne. I also liked that they have a restroom inside the buffet. Better than walking all the way outside of a buffet to go to the restroom.

I recommend this place for breakfast. I haven't tried their lunch and dinner so stay tuned for future reviews.",2,0,1

We all know that buffet food isn't stellar, but being the Bellagio I thought it would be a bit better. Most of the food was either over or under salted. Nothing really stuck out. OMG - Sushi was really bad. Very dry and all rice!  Desserts were so-so and nothing really stood out.  The only good part was all the champagne and a great wait staff. Otherwise..Your run of the mill buffet. The food looks pretty but the taste isn't there.

I have been to my share of buffets and always leave disappointed and have pretty much stopped going to them. However, we had a credit to use at any restaurant\/cafe in the Bellagio and decided to give this a go since the MGM buffet was pretty good when I visited a few years ago. This buffet, bar far, was the best buffet I've ever been to. We hit it right in between breakfast and lunch so got to have a bit of both for the breakfast price. The breakfast included lox and bagels - the lox were so creamy and not fishy at all, very very good. Also had the waffles and my friend had the french toast. We hit the dessert table more than a few times and everything was delicious. We got the drink package and our waiter was awesome, attentive, and definitely more than happy to fill our glasses and keep them full (sometimes I feel like with bottomless drinks, it's hard to get someone to come fill up your glass - definitely not the problem here). I would definitely recommend this buffet, you won't regret it if you're into buffets. The quality of the food is good and the selection is huge.

The wait to get inside wasn't too long when I went for and early dinner (~20 min), but it's understandable why they would take their time letting people in even though there are tables available. The buffet area isn't too large and if every table is full of people, it would be chaos. 

The food I enjoyed the most was the seafood. In a quick summary: the sea bass (YUM!), smoked salmon, and crab legs (YUM!!!). The mussels were a bit sandy and the sushi wasn't that good either, but it made up for it by having some delicious desserts. The creme brulee was to die for, so creamy and with a hint of coffee flavor, and the raspberry chocolate mousse cone had a wonderful surprise on the bottom of the cone. Definitely worth trying every single dessert, they're all petit sized so yes it is possible and no one will judge. Also the watermelon was ridiculously red, I couldn't resist eating a whole bunch of slices!

The waiters were nice and pretty quick, but our waiter definitely got a little bit confused with the drinks. We ordered a ginger ale, coke, and iced tea. The first time he brought the ginger ale, coke, and a sprite; second time he brought a ginger ale, sprite, and iced tea, very weird. Not that picky so it didn't really matter too much.

The asian station was also very limited, 2 veggie dishes, ""chow main"", fried rice, and an unusual take on Chicken Biryani.  The biryani was very gravy-ish...not quite the biryani I'm used to.

It *is* a buffet, so you do have to get up and get a plate and walk around and put food on your plate etc. However, the food is just far higher quality than almost any other buffet you'll ever see. Everything is made with superb ingredients, and it's obvious from the flavor, and the chefs make all the food perfect both in appearance and in taste. 

The decor is cheerful and classy, yet not so over the top that you'd feel out of place if you walk in wearing shorts and a polo shirt. The staff is cheerful, friendly and attentive. 

I visited several times, over two visits to Las Vegas. Most of the time, the line is very short. On one occasion it was quite long, but moved very quickly.

For $42 per person and with the Bellagio reputation, I had high expectations.  

We were seated in a side room that was so  packed with tables that it was like an obstacle course getting to our table dodging other diners.  Oh!  The room smelled like tacos even though Mexican wasn't on the buffet.

I was shocked when they told us we had to serve ourselves our own drinks.  The waitress did not even ask us if we wanted a beverage from the bar.  By the way, they will add an 18% mandatory gratuity to your bill if u have 8 or more guests and the waitress doesn't even serve soft drinks.  That was a huge minus for me and kind of cheesy!  Basically the waitresses cleaned off the tables.

The food was just mediocre.  I had the turkey and some prime rib.  Both were dry and tough.  I had the kale salad, tasteless.

I had friends from LA in town and I took them to this place. Unfortunately I have a Ruth Chris Budget and they were Sizzler. So it was pretty expensive for them.

Downsides include a few mediocre offerings (stuffing was served in a disk shape and had a hockey puck texture to it - though my brother said gravy helped it a lot). The buffet area is a little cramped and is easily congested.

The seafood was abundant - both cooked and raw. A wonderful sushi bar. An entire area devoted to wonderful european style thin crust pizzas - seven or eight kinds, and other Italian delicacies. There was a station of delicious innovative salads and an area of warm meats - loin of pork done on a rotisserie in the background, prime rib slices, chicken wellington and on and on.

The one at Bucchanal is a close 2nd though. Bucchanal charges much more to Bellagio for what they serve in terms of unique food items.

Buffets I've been to in Vegas: Bellagio, Bucchanal (Caesars), Cravings (Mirage), Wicked Spoon, and Wynn.

I always come here for their Chilean sea bass. I'm a seafoody so any buffet that serves this fish wins it for me. The last time I came here they didn't have their ""Gourmet Dinner"" concept which I presume added their Beef Wellington, Kobe beef, Duck breast, Caviar, and their Alaskan King crab legs (Yes that's right, not Alaskan ""Snow"" crab legs which are much cheaper in price per lb). Now let's get down to what's good here:

Beef wellington was absolutely amazing here. I ate so many slices of this. Cooked perfectly to medium rare and perfect crusting wrapped around the beef tenderloin. Definitely recommending getting this item.

Kobe beef was surpisingly not that good. It was very lean and dry. We asked if we could have a more rare side but they didn't offer it. Kind of surprised. So I waited for the next batch and noticed it was more red this time around so I gave it another chance but stil it was very try and tough. I was expecting a marbly piece of meat. Maybe it was incorrectly labelled. It was not the Kobe beef I was expecting at all =S Would not try this item again.

Chilean Seabass was amazing as always. Did not change one bit from the last time I came here which was about 4 years ago. It's an expensive piece of fish that unfortunately other popular buffets do not serve. This again is a reason in itself to choose Bellagio buffet over the overs for those seafood lovers.

Alaskan King Crab and Snow Crab legs were very mediorce. Starting to not appreciate the frozen then thawed crab legs. They lack the real crab taste and it's super salty. I love crab legs but unfortunately it has come down to point where you need to just get them fresh to enjoy it. Frozen crab legs just don't count it for me anymore; the difference in taste is far too much now.

Prime rib is amazing as always; one of the better prime ribs served compared to the other buffets I think. They have beef juice and horseradish to go with it. I always get multiple slices of this everytime I come here. Definitely recommend trying it! Make sure it's medium rare or more rare! Anything cooked above medium-rare is just a waste of meat!

Caviar variety was okay but maybe I'm just not a caviar kind of guy. I tried all 3 of them caviars. Flying fish roe, Salmon roe, and Sturgeon roe (black caviar). They were all very salty and not much desired flavor. I'll pass on this the next time I come here but it's worth a try I guess since this is something new they added to the ""Gourmet Dinner"". I also tried their Steak Tartare which was okay. Not very appetizing though because it straight up looks like raw ground beef with some seasoning on it. Not for the faint hearted. I'd still give it a try since it's not usually offered during their non-Gourmet meals.

I still think this is the go-to buffet. I wouldn't mind going to Bucchanal again as well but I think the Bellagio buffet had more memorable items to come back for compared to the rest.",7,2,2

They have a good selection of the 'basics' that one might expect at a buffet: king crab legs, snow crab legs, stone crab claws (these were overcooked though), prime rib, turkey, and a pretty good dessert selection. I pretty much just stocked up on king crab legs all night while trying the prime rib and hangar steak. The other nice offering here is the caviar, which was pretty darned good (the Tobiko in particular). Their sushi selection is decent and the tuna was pretty fresh too. 
Dessert was good - they have a large selection of stuff as well as soft serve machines with really good sorbet and custard. Cheaper than Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon but smaller in size. You can't go wrong if you just want no-frills and if you're ok with a smaller selection.

However, as often as we stay here, I'm always the odd ball out skipping out on the buffet portion because of the price. Anyway, since the buffet here is hailed as the 2nd best (if not the best) buffet in town, we figured it was best if we went early to avoid the lines on my mother's insistence that I go this time. It was a smart move. On a Monday night, we arrived around 5:30PM, and the line was already starting to form. We waited in line for ~20 minutes until we were seated. From the time we paid for our meal which was ~$130 for 4, I thought to myself that this better be the best damn meal I'll have during this vacation! It didn't start that way though. It took our server 10+ minutes to get our order of drinks in, and she even ended up bringing out the wrong drinks the first time. She did however, redeem herself throughout the meal by frequently coming to check on us. It was even pleasant when she tried to strike up a conversation with us.

As far as the food goes, they have a wide variety that will appeal to almost everyone's tastes. From seafood (crab legs, shrimp cocktail sauce, oysters, salmon) to carving stations (kobe beef, prime rib), from the salad station to the pizza selection, and to my favorite dessert stop, you'll get a taste of gourmet food from all ethnic cuisine. The quality of most of the food is as close as top notch as you can get when it comes to a buffet. There's not much to complain about in that aspect. I adored the shrimp cocktail, and I had 2 full plates of it; the cocktail sauce decently surprised me. I'm not so sure on how to feel about the crab legs though because I could only get so little meat out. The Kobe beef bled everywhere, so I ended up not touching it. My mother couldn't stop going back to the sushi section. The fruit was extremely fresh, and the melons especially were as sweet as ever! As for the dessert table, they were all appealing to the eye, and most were at the very least decent. Yes, I tried and finished every single plate there. My favorite would have to be the little macarons! I took plenty of those. The frozen yogurt (??) was extremely tart, and it melted a little too quickly so I didn't bother getting seconds.

So why did I dock 1 star off? Well, I accidentally overfilled my plate and dropped a cherry tomato onto the floor (which I had tried to look for but couldn't find where that little devil had rolled off to). Seconds later as I headed back to my table, a staff member had picked it up, shoved it in my face, and scoffed at me as if I was less than dirt for dropping a little tomato on their floor.

My only advice to anyone who wants to give the buffet at Bellagio a try is to show up early. As we were leaving an hour later, the line had somehow quadrupled in size; it went out of the buffet area and into the casino somewhere with no end in sight.

All in all, give it a try! It's moderately priced for the food and a definite try for any Vegas vacation.",2,1,1

I went for a weekday brunch which costs about $30. My favorite items include the flank steak, hamburger sliders w\/fixings station, breakfast favorites like waffles and pancakes, pork buns, green beans, and creme brulee. While the selection wasn't as expansive as I would've liked, the portions were well sized, so I could try a little bit of everything without having to polish off lots of extra food. Items that disappointed include the eggs benedict -- the English muffin was hard to cut through. It probably had been toasted too long or sitting out too long. The soup selection also sounded delicious -- tomato, baked potato, etc. -- but were mostly bland. I did enjoy the shrimp and mussels offered at brunch, and wish I tried the biscuits and gravy, omelette station, and a few more meats from the carving station. My favorite dessert was the creme brulee. They also had cannoli's, pie tarts (key lime, pecan, lemon meringue, etc), soft serve, bread budding, and cakes. 

Service was very friendly albeit somewhat slow as far as clearing off dishes. For the section I was seated, there were some tables filled with plates from previous parties that didn't get cleaned off until much later. My family was a little off put the self serve drink station since we normally saw that at budget buffets, but I guess it makes sense given the number of diners. 

I overheard some diners nearby telling a waitress, ""The Bellagio isn't the Bellagio anymore. It's cheap!"" While I hadn't eaten at the Buffet beforehand, I can imagine it was once the best of the best before the likes of Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon came along (both on my list for next time!).

Since we don't drink, this is a waste of money to us, so I was glad to be able to purchase my meal without adding on a cost for drinks. 

We liked the variety of sweet foods and salty, breakfast and lunch. There were fun things like red velvet waffles.

The buns on the sliders could have been used to pound nails. I actually tried to pierce one by striking it with a table knife. No chance. Hard boiled egg? The yolk was quite literally powder due to overcooking. Fish? Sponge. Actually sucked all the moisture out of my mouth, couldn't get the bite down without a lot of water. The rice? Just...don't. Really. Don't.

All of the dessert items I tried could have been bought at a grocery, and had better quality. Frankly, the desserts were the only edible items from the dozen I tried and even they were marginal.

It gets better.

I asked for an IPA. The waiter had no idea what an IPA was. I explained that it was a type of beer. ""Oh, we have Bud Light, Stella, and (something else) for $14""  I told him that I'd have a water. ""Good choice. Which was that again?""

""Water. Because there is no way that I'm going to pay $14 for a Budweiser.""

We went during a transition period, scoring the selection of a late lunch and early dinner for the price of lunch, also upgraded to the endless glass of champagne. 

DISAPPOINTMENT all around...where to begin? 
- champagne was just brut wine......domestic stuff....I know, I know, I should have known better considering the price. 
- decor\/lighting was dark and very generic\/Hometown Buffet. I kind of expected them to carry out the Bellagio theme throughout the ENTIRE hotel...how silly of me to assume such things
- poor transition from lunch to dinner. There were times where stations were empty...that would never happen at the Wynn
-salmon was doused in a bbq sauce! Fish is delicate, why on earth would you drench it in bbq sauces?!?!?!

Things that saved the meal from being a complete waste of money: 
* dessert array - not to say that it was good, but at least they have a wide selection 
* sushi - stay away from the nigiri pieces, it just doesn't look right, however the seaweed salad was good as was the poke selection 
* frisee\/spinach salad with walnuts & cranberries

From lunch to dinner, there wasn't that big of a difference except they did bring out the snow crab legs and crawfish and took away the breakfast items. Also the meats changed and they took away the BBQ ribs and came out with the prime rib. 

The sushi at any buffet was just below average but I did like the poke especially the salmon poke with the spicy mayo sauce on the side (dinner item?). Meats were good and I especially loved the BBQ ribs from lunch. I'm not really into snow crab but other tables had plates full of them (you know they're getting their money's worth!). 

Desserts had an okay selection and the standout favorites of mine were the mango panna cotta and the cheesecake. The tiramisu panna cotta was also good.

Reasonable price for nice variety including crabs and prime rib

So my husband and I are very much buffet fanatics when visiting Vegas.  We usually end up going to buffet at least once a day.  

We always loved Bellagio buffet and have been here several times.  It has a great mix of pretty much what you expect in a buffet.  Considering price, food choices (seafood included), ambiance, it is a solid 4 stars.

* Food:  
- Snow and King crabs = cut in half and COLD.  The best thing about the crabs here is that they have plenty of them out so you won't have to stand in line for so long.  (HINT:  Snow crabs are actually more tasty than the King crabs...I know, it's werid)

- Prime Rib = very yummy, very fast line.

* Price: $29.95\/person (Thursday night)

* Ambiance = typical casino buffet.  Very nice but not so nice that you feel awkward carrying a plate full of crab legs and melted butter.  

* Service = Very attentive.  No need to ask for refills or taking away dirty dishes.",3,0,0

This was THE best buffet compared to all buffets I've EVER experienced. I sat there from Brunch to Lunch in an ORGY of good food. Everything prepared fresh, and tasty, nothing dry or overcooked.

I felt naughty afterwards.... 

REEAAAAALLLY NAUGHTY.

After having been a good boy for months, I sucumbed to the temptation or rather the convenience of dining buffet style. 

As far as buffets go, The Bellagio buffet is pretty good - although since it is food on an assembly line the taste is not as good as a sit down restaurant. 

The buffet features the ubiquitous shrimp that are found at even the cheapest buffets and also some crab.
Other than that, the fare includes: american, italian, chinese and japanese dishes. The Bellagio is a little lite on the vegetarian fare - but I guess they will eventually catch up to the current trend.   

The desserts are quite extensive, although none were outstanding (comparable to most upperscale hotel sunday brunches).

Probably one of the better ones in Vegas.",1,0,2

I like that part of the sushi and salad bars are monitored by staff because some people tend to eat, cough, talk or sneeze as they pile on their plates.

Primed ribs - best I've had. Be careful not to OD on this like I almost did. 

Sushi - ask the guy behind the counter to give you fresh ones. Some people, I understand really like their sashimi, but no need to pick the fish and leave the rice.

They have a huge variety of food, so I didn't even have time to get through all of it, but the sushi and meats were pretty tasty, especially for a buffet.

There're probably about a dozen different meats that the servers will cut for you, so if you love kobe beef, rack of lamb, and all that other good stuff, you'll probably love it here.  I wish I had been hungrier so I could've gone back for seconds, but trying one of everything was pretty good too.

Also the desserts... I don't know if they always have the same stuff, but the home made marshmallows and meringues were delicious.

Oh, and one of the biggest things you should watch out for... the lines.  I'm sure there're better off-peak hours you can probably get in more easily, but we went around 7 or 8ish, so it was PACKED.  If we had waited in line, it probably would've taken at LEAST an hour to get in.  Luckily a friend talked to one of the servers and got us to skip the line, I'm not sure how, but you might be able to skip the line if you have some sort of membership, or maybe just if you're a girl good at sweet talking waiters :P

The food wasn't changed out regularly enough. We stayed past 4 when they swapped over to dinner, and bread wasn't refilled for at least 30 minutes.

They didn't have any red meat... Only ribs and chicken at the carving stations. I tried their saint Louis ribs and thought it was pretty dry and tart. Didn't care to go for seconds. The only seafood they had was shrimp cocktail embedded in a huge shelf of ice. The shrimp was actually plump and big. Taste and texture was not bad at all. Probably my favorite thing at the buffet.

  Almost all of the food was good. My favorites were the prime rib, shrimp and pesto pizza, sushi, macorroni, clams, and pastas. The service was also good. When I asked if they had any medium-well prime rib the chef put it on the grill and cooked it for me.

The interior of this place is gorgeous and price-appropriate. Everything is clean and fresh. The buffet itself is huuuge, but there is no way you're going to be able to try everything, so don't even attempt. We tried. Didn't succeed.

Food I found meh\/would eat again:
- Beef wellington
- Tuna\/salmon poke salads (yay! raw fish yum!)
- Sausage (hard to mess up)
- Stuffing (I loooove stuffing but it was a bit dry)
- Sushi - was okay, but if they're gonna serve sushi and call it fancy, they're going to have to get a properly trained sushi chef. The rolls were fine, but the nigiri looked like it had been assembled by a toddler. Okay I'm exaggerating, but you get my point.

Food I found bleh:
- Christmas goose (super dry)
- Snow and king crab legs (wayyyyy over salted and cooked to the point of toughness)
- The flan was gross. I couldn't get myself to eat more than 1 bite, and flan is usually my absolute favorite dessert.

My favorites:
- Roasted veggies (mmmm)
- The premade salads were all delish
- Smoked salmon (but isnt' it the same everywhere?)
- Shrimp cocktail (the shrimp here are HUGE and cooked to the point where they are nice and juicy, but not chewy!)
- Desserts were pretty good--and gorgeously plated. They had cheesecakes, various mini cakes and cupcakes, soft serve, chocolate covered strawberries, fruit tarts, and giant MACARONS! The chocolate macaron I managed to snag made me really happy (these things are hard to get!) but they ran out on my second trip, so :(.

The pizzas were cold.  Waited for one of the advertised pizza, asked about it, and it took them 30 minutes to put it out!  
The asian food was nasty. The thai chicken salad didn't have chicken. LOL!
The ribs had a propane taste to it.
The smoked salmon was good, but there were several pieces that hadn't finished dethawing, still frozen at the core!

The lox were very fresh and not fishy. I wouldn't expect such high quality lox at a buffet, but it was a pleasant surprise. The Vietnamese springs rolls were also awesome. I tried the eggs benedict which were good, as well as items from the carving station. The only miss was probably the Chinese food. It was a worse than hole-in-the-wall Chinese, primarily because of the amount of oil present in each dish and the lack of quality sauces and preparation. Everything else was top notch though.

Like all other Vegas buffets, the spread was pretty decent with a full sushi station featuring make-your-own hand rolls, a full salad bar, a carving station with prime rib and steak (which was overdone), a soft serve machine, and a wide array of mini desserts.

So I finally gambled for the first time with my $25 Grazie credit, which came with my suite package for The Venetian and luckily I won $55. With that said I wanted to eat somewhere nice on my last day in Vegas so my girlfriend and I went looking for a buffet and a lot of people suggested to go to this one. 

The wait was not long at all and I think the price was a little over $22. That's definitely worth it already if you really put into consideration where you're eating. 

They have so many different stations, and everything I ate was beyond rich in flavor. My favorites were the Bleu Cheese Pasta, which had Chicken and Sun Dried Tomatoes!!! EXCELLENT!!! I also loved their cutting station which had Kalbi beef. I've never been to a buffet that had a cutting station that served that and it was one of the tastiest meats I've ever tasted. 

They also have: 

-A soup station which had four different soups, can't remember off the top of my head... Miso was definitely one of them... 

-Italian, which had you Pizzas and Pastas. Every pasta I tried was really tasty. 

-They have the cutting station which I mentioned earlier. 

-They have an excellent salad station. Their selection of add-ons is one of the biggest I've ever seen. 

-They have freshly made sliders (mini burgers) at their grilling station. You can choose from beef or turkey sliders. Beside that are the extras you can put in like condiments and vegetables. 

-They have a mini-bakery section with different breads like white, sourdough, wheat. 

-They also had a build your own sandwich station. I had one with some exotic Italian deli meat. I forgot what it was called but it was muy delicioso. 

-They also have an Asian foods section. 

-A seafood section, which has a whole section dedicated to shrimp. I LOVE SHRIMP!!! 

-They have a gigantic dessert station which has the greatest Strawberry Tarts I've ever had in my life. I usually hate tarts because I hate anything that's beyond sweet, but these I genuinely love. They have lots of chocolate and fruity goodies, as well as a soft serve yogurt station. 

The service was excellent. Our waitress had a whole section to herself and she was on top of it all!!! Even though Cherry Coke wasn't on the menu she actually brought me a coke and and mini cup of Cherry Grenadine so that I can put as much as I want!!! The chef at the cutting station already remembered me the third time around and already knew what to give me without me having to ask. 

This is the most amazing buffet I've ever been to. Most buffets rush whatever they cook but you can tell that their chefs do put love into the food that they make. The best part about all this is I honestly felt that they could have charged more yet they kept it at a relatively low price for a hotel of its stature.

Not so at the Bellagio!  Sure, the price is steep, but well worth it.  I found the food to be fresh and of a wide variety.  They had a sushi station, a chinese station, and actual seafood.  I was there on a Friday night for dinner, and they had three types of crab leg and shrimp (can you tell I like seafood).  The service was quick, food was hot, and everything was refilled in a timely manner.  Dessert was good, but it didn't blow my mind.  The meat was great too.  They had several different types of beef, all cooked differently.  Alcohol is not included in the meal, but soft drinks are.  I think it was like $45 pp.

We arrived on the earlier side, maybe 5 pm, and had to wait about 15 minutes to get in.  When we left dinner, the line was obnoxiously long.  I suggest getting there before your typical dinner time to decrease your wait time.  

I didn't try any other buffets, but I have looked at others.  In the Harrah's hotel, for example, the buffett was much cheaper but the offerings lacked variety and there wasn't a ton offered.  So, we decided to skip on that and headed to the Bellagio instead.",0,0,0

In turn, MGM has gone on the cheap, cutting down on all of the service stations. They let pizza and other dishes sit there until the last slice is taken.

I visited this location on a Monday night and paid $34 to partake in the mountainous piles of seafood, pasta, salad, soups, meats, and international fare offered here.  There was no line and I was excited to dive in as soon as possible.  Buffets are a great place to try foods that I wouldn't normally try or order at most other sit-down restaurants.

I started by piling my plate high with King Crab legs.  Having never tried these before, I now understand why the fisherman on Deadliest Catch go to such lengths to catch them.  Wow!  This was a fantastic opportunity to fill up on an item that I will likely not have again for some time.  I also very much enjoyed the Kobe Beef, shrimp, roasted fingerling potatoes, and so much more!  I would love to list off everything that I ate but in complete honesty... I can't for the life of me remember nor picture each plate that I brought back to the table.  

As a girl with a sweet tooth, I was ecstatic to discover the number of options I had at the dessert bar.  What I liked most about it were the very small portions served.  I grabbed a big plate and brought 4 or so small desserts back with me to sample each.  As I circled around my plate of goodies, I couldn't believe how delicious one dessert was compared to the next.  Cheesecake, cappuccino mousse, rich chocolate bubbles, and nutella tarts were swimming across my vision and eventually in my belly.

In addition to the excellent options and flavorful food, the service here was equally impressive.  Our waiter was very quick to clear our plates and refill our drinks with each departure.  Considering my date and I were barely at the table at the same time,  going up for food whenever our plates happened to empty, this was a difficult feat to complete.  When my napkin appeared even slightly soiled from some stray cocktail sauce, a fresh one showed up.  New silverware even appeared during my time there.  Fantastic!

I guess I should have written this a while ago. However, the Buffet came to mind when recommending it to others recently. 

On our trip to Las Vegas this past Spring, we stopped in at the Bellagio Buffet as it was close by to the theatre where we had tickets to see ""O"". I was very ill, and did not feel much like eating. But, I needed something in my stomach to offset the Day-Quil, etc. When we were seated, the waiter took pity on me and aimed me toward the soup station. What was originally going to be a chicken noodle soup experience turned out to be every kind of soup to choose from that I could possibly imagine. 

I had a sampling of six hearty and flavorful soups, and that drummed up my appetite for a round of sushi, and a stop for gelato with a small dessert. 

They have everything on the buffet that can be imagined. Most people head straight for the prime rib, but there is a whole section of fish dishes, salads, sushi, and really beautiful desserts. I wish I had been in better form during my visit so I could have fully enjoyed more selections, but what I did have was perfect. 

The staff was super friendly and made me feel a little better if just for a while.",2,0,1

Fish was nicely cooked, and sushi was reasonably fresh.  Pastas seemed a bit warmed over, and the desserts were uniformly too sweet for my taste.

Still, though, with at least a handful of standouts (smoked salmon!  shrimp cocktail!, surprisingly tasty pizza!)... you're likely to get your money's worth if you're at all hungry, especially if you're impressed by the insane variety of foods like I was.

I actually went twice... once Thursday night at 9:30pm for a late dinner ($29.95), and then again Saturday at about 2:30pm for ""brunch"" ($23.95, if I remember correctly).

'twas no line at all on Thursday, and I feel that the food was of better quality than on Saturday for some reason.  On Saturday, I learned that pretty much all non-alcoholic drinks were included in the buffet price, including a fab fresh-squeezed and bottomless orange juice; not sure if that's true also for the dinners as well.

All in all, I'd recommend at least one trip to this buffet to all Vegas-goers, though next time I think I'll stick to fixed-portion very-high-quality meals for the sanity of my waistline and energy levels (I felt kinda like a slug for the rest of the day after stuffing myself on Saturday!)",2,1,1

After we finished eating, we found that the line had gotten even longer. Overall, I was not impressed with brunch. Dinner is much better, but also more costly. I went to the Wynn and Wicked Spoon lunch buffets the days before I went here, so I was way spoiled by the selection those other places had. This buffet has the atmosphere of a cafeteria, which is a total disconnect from this high and mighty establishment. And although I don't mind, our servers were not as personal as other comparable buffets.

Lunch starts around 12 or 1 and that's when the next set of menu items are set out. This would include sushi, seafood, and some roasted meats. But even for brunch, there were some meaty dishes. There was stir fry, prime rib, and miso soup. I liked that there were rice porridge with fixings as well. All the standard offerings of fruit, eggs, breads, pastries, oatmeal were there too. The desserts were lackluster.

The bottomless champagne for $5 is a good deal, but all that bubbly will take room in stomach too, so beware! We made our own mimosas by asking for orange juice, but the orange juice served here is not pulp-free. The grapefruit juice is pretty good though.",1,1,2

I'm a bit of a fattie when I find food I like and while my girlfriend and her parents finished at 2 plates.. I didn't satisfy my craving until 5.  I knew I wouldn't be coming back anytime soon so I had to get my fill of this place so I could savor the many flavors in my memories.  Here's a list of what I remember having:

-Herb Roasted Potatoes
-Stir Fried Vegetables
-Sliced Ham
-Lemon Salmon
-California and Unagi Rolls
-Potato Salad
-Jello
-Frozen Yogurt
-Pizza
-Mixed Vegetables
-Key Lime Pie
-Cheesecake
-Chocolate Pie
-Creme Brulee
-Chocolate Eclair

There's probably more but since it was all the way back in March I can't remember it all =P

This place is expensive though for dinner.. about $50 a person when I went. But hey, it's Vegas.  I would definitely recommend this as a MUST if you're ever in the area.  Despite the high price, you'd probably see me here again and again if I lived near by.",0,0,0

I found there to be a pleasant variety with pretty fresh food for a buffet. I find this buffet--along with Cravings at the Mirage--to be one of the better, more affordable buffets on the strip.

The dinner service has incredible seafood selections. I had four different types of ceviches and every single one of them was delicious. I also ate a marinara pasta they served at dinner and ate a plateful of it. Bellagio knows how to do pasta!

My only complaint is that the food organization seems a little wild. One of my favorite things about Cravings at the Mirage is that patrons can choose which section of the buffet they want to visit based on ""ethnic"" or ""type."" At the mirage, if you're in the mood for salad, you go to the salad section.... if you want Chinese, you go to the Chinese section.... if you want Italian, you go to the Italian section, and so on. The Bellagio has no signs or clear cut divisions, so I had to walk around the buffet several times to gather an idea of where everything I wanted was. This is only a minor gripe though!

Other foods I distinctly remember because of how scrumptious they tasted are the roasted squash and the marinated mushrooms. The mushrooms were available at both lunch and dinner, while the squash was available during lunch. The squash was slightly sweet due to a brown sugar coating and it was perfectly caramelized. I would never have expected to eat such a great squash dish at a buffet. Usually vegetables at buffets are boring and low on taste, but not at the Bellagio! I'll definitely visit the Bellagio for meals again.",3,0,2

Let me reiterate. I know my buffets. And let me tell you this: This is a buffet to top all other buffets. The crowning jewel of buffets, if you will. And with my love of places like Hometown Buffet where it's a strip-mall bargain, let's just say, at $29.95, my expectations for the Bellagio Buffet are pretty sky-high. 

Surpassed.

I had dined here once several years ago, remembered it was good, remembered I liked it better than the Wynn buffet, but just hoped it would be a good choice still. Success. We had dined at the Monte Carlo buffet the night before, and though it was one-third the price (buy-one-get-one, woo!), the Bellagio Buffet was worth every penny in comparison. Service was better (even with a long wait!), too.

Wandering through the buffet, I felt like Alice in a food wonderland, marveling at the choices. It was also my first time here as a pescaterian (formerly vegetarian), so the seafood choices rolled out before my eyes. Swordfish! Sushi! Somebody stop me!

I realize this sounds pathetic, but I don't care ... I was in such a blissful state during this meal. Perhaps it was the company of a dear friend, or the fact that I was on vacation. Or quite possibly that everything I tried was freakishly delicious. Anyway, I entered a state of zen during my dining experience here, and what I'm trying to say is, you'd be foolish to skip this place on your next trip to Vegas.",6,8,7

The food was always well stocked, the servers were attentive, and the quality of the food was surprisingly good. I'm not a fan of buffets so when I say it's good, I mean it's gooooood. 

STACK UP ON: 
- Flank steak: sweet like kbbq yet smoky like carne asada
- Pizza: thin crust but pretty good for buffet pizza
- Chilled shrimp: big shrimps that are already peeled so you'll spend more time eating
- Clam chowder: filled with clams and potato but has a nice creamy texture too
- Bacon\/scrambled eggs\/sausage: if you go during the times of brunch, this might be available and if you're a fan of breakfast too, get it! 
- Cheesecake: there's a thin layer of cream on top of the actual cheesecake so beware if you're not a fan of cream
- Pecan pie: boyfriend's brother really enjoyed eating this and said it was good

SKIP: 
- Pasta: you have the choice of either marinara or white\/cheese (?) sauce but they are very bland and didn't stand out
- Marinated pork bun\/cha sieu bao: texture of the meat doesn't resemble the taste of those from dim sum and although the taste is close, it's not close enough for me to enjoy eating it
- Fruits: watermelon, honey dew, and cantaloupe weren't very sweet, sadly

I've had the Wynn twice - the first was incredible, the second time was alright.  I've had the Paris once, which I remember being very nice.

There was something about the Bellagio buffet, even for lunch, that really made me take note.  Everything was so delicious, not to mention beautiful and with such a diverse selection.  That's the beauty of a fancy buffet - that there are SO many choices, but places like the Bellagio and Wynn take diversity to new heights with raw-bar offerings (sushi, smoked salmon), multiple pasta dishes, a carving station of perfectly prepared roasts - and this description hardly does a buffet of this caliber justice.  This is the farthest thing from your Golden Corral experience!!

Back to the Bellagio.. I just can't recommend it enough, and I may go as far as to say it's my favorite buffet experience in Las Vegas to date.  I tried everything.  I mean... EVERYTHING.  And it was all good. (Sushi selection was alright, but I can imagine it's hard to keep really fresh sushi continuously available throughout the day.)

And I haven't even mentioned desserts, which I actually felt weren't even the highlight of the meal.  Sure they were beautiful and good - mini servings of everything including crème brulée, key lime pie, carrot cake, etcetera etcetera.  I would have been satisfied by the rest of the buffet if the desserts had merely been ice cream!  

By the way, I arrived for lunch around 12pm and and walked right in. No line folks.  However, when we were walking out around 2p, the line to eat was out the door.  If you can manage to keep ""normal"" meal hours in Vegas, it seems the lines will be kind to you...",1,1,0

Service was pretty crappy, especially considering the half hour we waited in line to get in. After paying a pricey $38 per person for dinner (which awkwardly starts at 3pm), the hostess wanted to sit my party of two at a terrible table behind a column in the middle of the flow of people and waiters going to the back area. I asked to change tables, which they weren't really happy with. I also noticed they tried to sit at least two other couples at that same table who also refused to sit there. 

Later on, two of the waiters even started fighting and yelling at each other in the middle of the floor around us while we were eating because one of them stole the other guy's tray, an attitude that was super unprofessional, especially for such a high-caliber hotel as The Bellagio. Not to mention the fact that many of the tables were still dirty with plates that still had to be taken away.

Wait in line: approx 1 hour, when we arrived at 1130am. We started about 40 feet behind the restrooms. The line was moving much faster in the casino portion, but started moving VERY slow once we approached the register, probably because less people were getting impatient and leaving - and the VIP people started to come because it was lunch time.

Once seated---

Ambiance: cafeteria style. A bit crowded, lots of families, and sometimes need to weave in and out of people to gt to the food (esp. the prime rib).

Drinks: Extra $6 for the champagne part of the brunch is a good deal, although th champagne is fairly low quality and my husband felt pretty ill afterwards.

Service: nice, pleasant, quick, and didn't feel rushed to leave.

Food: There's a lot, so I'll have to break this up. I'll first list what there is, then my personal comments at the bottom.

Salad bar: small make it yourself salad bar with toppings, spinach, etc. Obviously no line here!

Brunch: hazelnut french toast, regular french toast (just OK), buttermilk pancakes, omelette station, and the usual cream of wheat, oatmeal (mushy), cereal & granola, muesli (premade small bowls), blintzes, sausage, scrambled eggs, bacon, cottage cheese, plain yogurt, melon and strawberries, and toppings of sliced almonds, brown sugar, cinnamon, thompson and golden raisins. Some breakfast baked goods in the dessert area: bran muffins, blueberry muffins, danishes, croissants...
Altogether: OK

Lunch:
Prime rib: hit or miss. The first one was magniticent, juicy and medium rare. The subsequent slices looked like roast beef. Tough and chewy. Weird. Pesto mashed potatoes, creamed sweet potatoes, were just OK.

Seafood: lots of seafood based salads. No king crab legs at brunch. boo!!

Asian: handrolls of vegetarian sushi, California rolls, tuna rolls, plus wakame salad, cucumber salad, noodles. Also gai lan, fried rice, noodles, steamed rice... Overall, OK. Not memorable.

Italian: vegetarian tomato-based penne (bleh), 6 different pizzas, -- not bad. Tasted fresh.

Salads: golden cous cous salad and Caesar. Slim pickings. Also a deli sliced cheese bar that I think was supposed to be a charcuterie. 

Dessert!!
Frozen sorbet and ice cream soft serve, bread pudding, coffee tiramisu, chocolate vanilla bomb, chocolate eclair, chocolate fudge brownie (a brick), caramel flan.

OK, MY Comments:

Unique:
1. Vegan: there's actually sorbet and some other offerings, since it's brunch, but pickings are slim. You're better off at Red Velvet Cafe that touts vegan organic healthy food and not going to a buffet.
2. Vegetarian: lots and lots, if you're ovo lacto. Especially since it's brunch.
3. Notable unique items: self serve sorbet, sugar free desserts (blueberry muffin, cheesecake, apple tart -- although they all tasted a little like chalk)

Get:
Vegetarian pizza
Prime rib - maybe
Cheesecake
Bread pudding (my weakness, personally)
OJ (fresh squeezed! hah)
Soft serve ice cream
Cheese blintz

Pass:
Sushi - boring
Mashed potatoes
Most of the American food
Salad bar to conserve stomach area
Charcuterie - mostly pre-packaged food
Sugar free desserts
Pastas
Chocolate fudge brownie (literally as dense as a brick)
Carrot cake - dry
French toast and pancakes - lacking flavor

Great cuts of meat, cocktail shrimp, and king crab legs. I eat pretty much the same stuff at every buffet in Vegas, but it's the quality that counts. Wynn is the best, but Bellagio is a close second.

Here's the thing - my girlfriend and I had just finished the rock n roll half marathon and wanted to eat.  Our original plans were to grab 1 buffet this weekend, and it was not going to be this one.  Unfortunately, the one we wanted to go to was closing by the time the race ended (we were planning on going a couple days prior, but circumstances required us to skip it).  Therefore, we were trying to decide between the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars, or this one.  We chose this one because although we loved the one at Caesars when we were last in Vegas, we wanted to try a new one.  Therefore, we came here.  However, we realized after we paid that we had been here before (we didn't remember going to 2 buffets our last trip) and therefore, should have gone to Caesars, which we preferred, but it was too late.  Therefore, I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have because I was disappointed in the decision to come here in the first place.

As I said, that's not really fair though because the Bellagio has a really good buffet.  Is it as good as Caesars?  Nope, but it has plenty of options and it's all high quality and very tasty.  It's funny, but you are actually not that starving after a long distance run.  I thought I would be, but until your muscles relax, everything is so tight that you can't eat as much.  Therefore, I wasn't able to eat as much as I wanted to.  Nevertheless, I did enjoy one plate full of carved turkey, rotisserie chicken, carved ham, kobe beef, and some potatoes.  Also had another plate of some Asian food and crab legs, and finally, 2 bowls of won ton soup, which was probably the best item (sooooooooooo deliciously salty!).

If I had to complain about something - and lets face it, if you know me, then you know I have to complain about a lot of things - it would be the dessert.  Firstly, no cookies?  How do you not have trays of cookies?  Secondly, a lot of the desserts were just disappointing.  No apple pie or cobbler, only 1 or 2 cheesecake options, no brownies.  They did have mini key lime pies, so there was that, and they also had ice cream, but it was 35 degrees out, so screw that.

Also, the buffet at Caesars serves things in little tapas plates.  So rather than you heaping loads of food you won't finish onto your plate, Caesar's controls the portions.  You can always grab more than one, or go back for more, but if I had to wager, I would say that Caesar's system wastes less food.  If you give me two buffets, and I can eat as much as I want - to the point of bursting and making a disgusting mess - at both, and both serve high quality delicious food, but one wastes less, then I'll go with that one.  Also, if I am being honest, Caesar's has better options, too.

But, just because Caesar's is better doesn't mean Bellagio is bad.  Heck, go to both.  Apparently, I did, but I ate so much I broke my memory.",1,3,0

Before I went here for dinner, my understanding was that even though it's an older buffet (when you compare it to Wicked Spoon, Bacchanal Buffet, etc), but the food is still very good. That is completely not true, not only it's an old buffet, the food is no where near the standards of some the new buffets at all.

We went on a Monday evening at about 5 PM, there was a 90 minute wait. By now, I am used to waiting for buffets, so it was not a big deal. Dinner was $32.99 on weekday nights as of August of 2013, it is on par with the other nicer buffets on the strip. Food offered in very limited variety, the Asian station was a joke. I've seen much better food at some of the cheaper buffets. Overall, unless you are staying at the hotel and want a quick bite when there is no line, I don't see any reason why anyone would come here. I will certainly not come back. If you are looking for a nice buffet, I would go to Wicked Spoon, Bacchanal or the Wynn.

Appetizers:
As with all buffets they have an extensive selection of cold seafood item such as shrimp and crab legs.  They are all good quality with nice selections.  Well laid out and without any unattractive pieces.

Salads:
The Bellagio does well here as well with a large fresh selection of veggies and very nice quality dressing.

Main Entree:
This is where the Bellagio shines, even though this is a buffet, you can custom order a number of dishes prepared just for you.  Although I don't quite remember the name, all I can say is that puff pastry filled with that cream chicken was delicious.

Desserts:
Very good selection as well, but it is middle of the road in terms of quantity and quality.

Overall the Bellagio buffet is a place you have to experience once as it is the benchmark for all other buffet comparisons.


Decor: 4 Stars (As with the rest of the Bellagio it is well decorated)
Service: 5 Stars (friendly staff)
Atmosphere: 4 Stars (clean and quiet)

Seriously, I love to eat.  And more often than not I care about quantity over quality.  Yes I know I should get out of that habit.  In fact, the buffets are one of the reasons I moved to Las Vegas to go to UNLV!  We just don't have spreads of buffets all over Hawaii, and to me this was heaven.

I'm older now, and my metabolism is slowin' down just a tiny bit...the pooch shows from too much eatin' if there's no cardio runnin'!  Gone are the days of eating cold pizza for breakfast, Reubens from the dining commons for lunch (God I love those things), In-N-Out for dinner, and beer for dessert!  I've noticed my palatte gets tired of the same old thing too, my taste buds like to be surprised every once in a while.  

This buffet brings back lots of memories.  Back in college, it was the first 'gourmet' buffet my school homies had ever been to.  I remember the Sunday brunch fondly, where else could we go and drink all the mimosas we wanted?  Getting hammered at breakfast seemed like a nice option at the time!  Not too shabby back then for only $25!  We felt like big spenders!

It's been a long time but the food is still good.  I took the kids there for their first ever fancy buffet (believe me, they're used to buffets like the one at Station Casinos but that's another review for another time) and boy were they surprised!  Like, eyes wide open and drooling surprised!  They couldn't believe this much food could be in one place.

Thanks to me, we were at the buffet well over 2 hours and got a little sample (okay, large sample) of what the Bellagio had to offer for lunch and dinner.  More on this later.  Anyway, we tried just about everything they had!  We went to town, the kids went APE-$**T!  If it was edible, it was put on a plate.  There was mounds of crab legs (which the little one loved because they were already cut in half, she had 2 plates), succulent prime rib, Angus beef sliders, pizza after gourmet pizza (Shrimp Scampi was my fav), veggie spring rolls, spare ribs, Kobe sirloin, lamb chops, and Beef Wellington was enjoyed by all.  We even tried lots of different stuff, like hand rolled sushi rolls, venison, duck confit (yum!),  roasted elk, ostrich, Chilean sea bass, seafood vol au vent (seafood in puff pastry), and steak tartar!  Fancy, fancy y'all!  

The food buzz was kickin' in but no one had even touched dessert yet!  Dessert ran rampant in this place!  We of course, had a bit of everything we could fit.  Creme brulee, cappuccino mousse, lemon tarts, fruit tarts, chocolate cake, tiramisu, oh so many more we stuffed our faces with!  I was totally, utterly full after this meal.  I for sure made the kids eat our money's worth as well!  This place ain't cheap!  But they loved it!!

Wanna sample as much gluttony as possible!  Best tip I can give you, go to the Bellagio for lunch but go late at like 3 PM.  Pay $20 + tax to get in, enjoy the last offerings of lunch...then prepare for dinner!  Dinner items start rolling out at around 3:30 PM.  Good thing too because the gourmet dinner costs upward of $38 + tax depending on whether or not it's a holiday or a weekend.  Save your A$$ some money in this recession!  You can use that money for TUMS afterwards.",2,4,1

The prices don't differ much but more should be expected of the $30 Bellagio than the $27 Wicked Spoon (on weekends as well!) This was sadly not the case.

The hype surrounding the crab legs turned out to be a meh moment. True, they were pretty huge. It is easy to mistake brine water for freshness but the texture gave them away. I'd imagined crab meat in its luscious and chewy grandeur but they were more like less than chewy strands soaked in ice and seawater. (Wicked Spoon had limited crab w\/ drawn butter and it tasted superior even when I was bloated)

The meat department fared only average imo. The alleged Kobe Beef was definitely not the kind that melts in your mouth. Although Wicked Spoon offers similar stuff, you do get more variety and at least the Galbi and Braised Short Ribs (at WS) were yummy.

Dessert: Oh don't get me started. WS throws its competition out of the window. How can Bellagio even compare? One would expect that the desserts should be worthy of Jean Phillipe Patisserie also in the hotel but that is far from true. The creme brulee was not bad but the cheesecakes and sorbets brought back horrific college dining hall memories. Compare this with: fresh strawberries and bite-size apples coated in amazing chocolate, shots of delicate mousse, a selection of delectable fudges and fresh, flavorful gelato at Wicked Spoon. For desserts alone, WS deserves 5 stars and I have to beat myself up to give Bellagio 2 stars.

2 stars for: the service - efficient although it wasn't the best; the cranberry juice (I would hardly be lying if I said that was the best thing I had all night). 

My only guess is WS is a new buffet building its name and the line was shorter (outrageous!). In a few years, I bet (that's what you do in vegas) the price, line and rating will far exceed Bellagio.",2,0,0

As for the pre-planning, that was done with Tami M., the buffet Manager.   It ended up that we were not going to hit our minimum and she ended up coming up with a solution so that we got the most bang for our buck   ie adding linen table cloths, preparing a wedding cake, putting boxes of chocolates on the tables for each guest, adding one mixed drink to be included with the price of the buffet and putting flowers on all of the tables.

Everything was AWESOME!!!!    I don't even know where to start.   Once all of our guests were gathered in front of the restaurant, someone came out and walked us back to the room.  He was very friendly and made us feel like we were the first group (32 guests including my husband and I)  to ever come in there.  We were pleasantly surprised that  we were actually going to have a room, we thought it would just be an area in the restaurant that was sectioned off for us.  Loved it!


The service was outstanding, it seemed like there was one server for every couple of people and none of the guests had to wait for anything--the servers were literally waiting for us and started taking drink orders immediately.  My husband and I felt like royalty at our own, special, table with our own server--he was great and a good sport (some of my friends are a little crazy).   Every time my husband or I needed another drink, or anything for that matter, it seemed like he was right there waiting to serve us.   Guests are STILL talking about how good the food was and how the service was better than what they expected at a buffet.       We were actually in the space later than we were suppose to be, until about 10:45, our contract said we only had the room until 10:00 pm.   None of the waitstaff said a word.  
 

The cake was delicious, we weren't exactly sure on the timing as to when to cut it and by the time we did most of the guests had already gotten dessert from the buffet.  SO, we ended up having the bottom layer and the top layer to take back to our room.   

 Tami and her team  helped to contribute to our special day by providing an outstanding level of service and great attention to detail.   We didn't have to worry about anything and had an amazing evening with our family and friends.   I sincerely appreciate how well they took care of us!    It was better than I could have imagined and my husband and I will cherish that memory forever.",1,0,0

By far the best buffet I've had in town in terms of quality of food.  Price not so good, but when the seafood buffet at the M is now 29.99, with this being 34.99 for dinner, it becomes a great bargain and has wonderful seafood.

I've gone here many times in the early 2000's, but I don't remember ever being impressed with the food as I was when I went last week.  They really stepped up their game here and this is the only buffet I'd actually pay for in town.

One thing about buffets that bother me is that fish dishes are always overcooked.  They sit under those heat lamps and it destroys the dishes.  Not here.  I had absolutely the best buffet seafood dish, Miso Sea Bass.  Yum, still craving it.  My husband said the turkey was the most moist turkey he ever has tasted at any buffet or anywhere else.

When my party and I arrived at around 12:30 the line was intimidatingly long.  It was moving pretty fast though and before we knew it our group of 8 were seated with champagne and orange juice (we had to mix our own mimosa's).

The variety is huge and everything I tried was delicious.  We had two waitresses (yup, stayed long enough for a shift change) and both really took care of us, especially our second one.  They both kept our champagne glasses absolutely full and were always prompt with bringing more orange juice.  I don't know why the orange juice comes in such small carafes though -- it could have saved them a lot of work to just give us a big pitcher.  Our second waitress was especially lovely.  She even warned us that the mimosa's ended at 4pm and to remember to get our fill because we paid so much to get in.

We stayed here long enough to see some of the dinner items brought out. Salmon poke and tuna poke were enough of a temptation to get my disgustingly full butt off my chair to sample just a bit more.  So a tip for the weekend:  Do come at around 2 pm (to account for line wait), and eat slow enough so you can at least get to sample some of the dinner items (brought out at ~4pm).

""Iced tea, sir"" I say to the drinks server and I split... leaving my comrades to fend for themselves amidst the carnage.  

I grab two plates for my initial run... the first one is always plated with a mid-rare cut of prime rib and extra horseradish, a cut of kobe beef and some veggies.  The second?  Yeah, I'm going for an entire pot of Alaskan King Crab!  I ain't even gotta peel it?  Drawn butter?  Game Over!  

Devouring the plates, I think I may have broken the record for the two minute crab scarf.  Nobody at the table says a damn thing during the first run.  Make a move for one my claws and you're pulling back a stump, buddy!

Round 2 - Hmmm, I can't let the food set... or else the eating crawls to a stop.  Take my customary two new plates and head over to the lamb rack.  Yeah, it's spiced up real well... poor poor baaaaaaaa.  As the rack gets chopped for my pleasure, I picture the demise of said lamb.  The shrieks are much like those coming from Tracy Chapman, as she sings ""Fast Car.""  I'm sorry, she sounds like a dying lamb... or is it a billy goat?  Anyway, I pile on some decent buffet sushi next to ol' lamb chop and head back to the Bering Strait for my second plate.  Yup, the fishermen from the ""Deadliest Catch"" are the reason I keep coming back to this buffet.  25 foot swells, lack of sleep and icy cold conditions make Alaskan King Crab fishing the world's most dangerous profession... and I'll eat their catch till they run out!

I'm attracting so many crabs to my stomach that Pam Anderson would pass with a clean bill of health the next go-round at the doctor's office.

Final Lap - now it's time for sweets.  I have to limit myself, due to high blood sugar (like the entire meal has been strictly dietary, right?).  All of the cakes and pies have been individually plated, looking straight out of some food network show.  The cheesecake is just a notch below those found at the ""Cheesecake Factory.""  As for me, I always go for the bread pudding... it's simple, sweet and filling.  I don't know what I'm thinking though, cuz unlike Jell-O, there's never room for more bread after such a meal.

 Standouts; the crab legs, mashed potatoes and the brown sugar encrusted pork (the BBQ sauce that went with it made the dish my favorite main). The banana's foster was a fantastic desert, particularly when poured over their vanilla ice cream.

There isn't a whole lot to say about the environment here: it's beige, really abundantly lit up, and loud.

I did like the first cut of lamb I had, but when I went back for another serving it seemed like they had prepped it completely different and all the flavors I liked the first time around were completely missing.  The sushi was abysmal.  The rice was dry and had a styrofoam taste to it.  The ribs were pretty good, but no one seemed to be stationed to cut them, so I had to make two trips before I could try them.  There were two things that stood out now that I'm concentrating on our meal: the strawberry and cream desert shooter, and the salmon poke.  The poke had a great fresh taste to it, and a really nice and subtle heat that reared its face after a couple bites.  The desert shooter was also really refreshing, light, and had a great tang to it from the slightly sour strawberry.

All in all, I don't think I'll be coming back to the Bellagio for their buffet.  It really shows it's age, both in the food and in its looks.

Ya, you can pay $20 somewhere else and get the same array of foods but who knows how long its been sitting there. At the end of the day, when I can't make it to the Bellagio, the Wynn buffet and Paris buffet are other great alternatives!

CONCLUSION:
EAT IT! and be a fatty! eat eat eat!",8,8,7

What it doesn't have is a modern\/clean look and beautiful scenery. I guess I started off by saying these things because I went to Bacchanal Buffet the day before at Caesar's Palace and that blew away every single buffet experience I've ever had.

The buffet at the Bellagio is obviously better than a random buffet off the strip. You pay for what you get for here (~$40 for a tasty buffet that's not bad). Paying $12 for all your can eat garbage somewhere else isn't comparable. But when you compare it to the Bacchanal Buffet, you'll understand what I'm trying to say in this review. I'm still going to give this place 4 stars (well deserved), but this is really a comparison review to the best buffet in Las Vegas (as already stated).

So, if you're going to only one buffet in Las Vegas, I do not recommend coming here. If for some reason you end up here though, you're stomach will still be happy and money well-spent.

Be sure to crab some crab legs and walk to the pasta station to get them steamed. Oh, and be sure to walk to another location to get butter. This is unlike the amazing\/beautiful\/spacious Bacchanal Buffet where you get your crab legs steamed and grab butter in the same location (makes sense right?).",5,3,1

Where to begin. The selection wasn't a mind blowing array, mainly Chinese, Japanese, Italian and Mexican. The food itself was bland, forgettable and greasy. Sadly the best things there were the Chinese broccoli and sea bass, but even those were so heavily greased it was hard to put down. The crab legs were still frozen. The prime rib looked like a slab of fat. The desserts were deceivingly pretty, but it tasted weird. Nothing tasted good. And to add insult to injury, when we asked for coffee, we got instant!

Was lucky to try both during my trip - reading previous reviews, looks like food selection varies slightly daily. My review is based on what I ate - there was alot that I did not try.

Price
- Bellagio is cheaper ($30) vs Wynn ($35)

Interior\/Atmosphere
- Liked Wynn better - garden decorations, more airy brighter & comfortable, less noisy. Bellagio layout seemed more packed & noisy.

Service
- Wynn servers were faster & more attentive and efficient (refills, plate  removal, coffee). 

Food
- Crab goes to Bellagio. Wynn only had split King Crab. Bellagio had King Crab & Snow crab. Both served the crab split & cold - straight from the box (Wynn server kept refilling the buffet straight from the box, they could have done this better). Flavor of both about the same, both very fresh tasting. Wynn provided drawn butter - Bellagio did not.

Shrimp was tie - great at both places.

- Red Meat goes to Wynn. Wynn prime rib was seasoned better - Bellagio tasted like any other buffet. Both offered leg of lamb but was dry. Bellagio offered Kobe sirloin - not memorable. Wynn offered lamb t-bone & osso bucco, both dry.

- Sushi goes to Bellagio. Wynn did not offer. Bellagio also offered Steak tartar - was not appealing or tasty.

- Salad\/Fruit\/Cheese\/Cold meats - tie. I did not eat any green salads or fruit. Salad layouts looked great - I'd rate them a tie. Wynn had cold meats - very nice. Cheese at Bellagio was very nice (esp for dessert).

Desserts goes to Wynn. Preparation of the deserts was better & more variety - loved the mango lychee tapioca. Wynn had more variety & was nicely presented in individual plastic flutes. Coffee was hot at Bellagio, Wynn was warm.

In summary
- Close Tie based on food alone. After trying both, I'm happy to report that both had very nice buffets & can highly recommend them both. If you are crunched for time & need to pick one, go for Wynn - based on atmosphere & service.",6,0,0

The stuff I had was just the basics: honey baked ham, eggs, sausages, biscuit and gravy, cheeses, and pancakes. Nothing fancy here... JUST AVERAGE ,BASIC BREAKFAST but yet we pay lots of loot here when we didn't eat that much ( just the two plates for me ).

The highlights here is are the champagne\/mimosa dang! our server got us hooked! The coffee here was awesome! I'm not sure what kind it was but their house coffee was off the hook as well. Their drinks here got me full not the buffet itself.

We were sitting next to a group of middle aged guys and it was Super Bowl weekend that day. It was funny that these guys were all jacked up for the weekend, it kinda reminds me of Al Bundy and his NO MA'AM cronies enjoying a weekend out away from their wives Lol.

Price\/Wait timeWe came a few days before New Years so of course, like any other buffet, we paid 'holiday' pricing of about $47 per person. The line wasn't long and we were quickly seated within 30 minutes (fast for 7PM), which worried me a bit. Really kind server; she took our drinks and kept coming back to check on us and refill our drinks. 

Food:
- If you love Asian food, or anything remotely related to pho, please DO NOT try the pho. They don't have typical pho rice noodles; it is just other Chinese noodles. The 'beef' broth is dark colored and very salty. It did not taste anything close to pho. It was more like canned broth, not really fresh. 

The sushi bar had tuna and salmon poke, assorted sashimi, and the only hand rolls available are the spicy tuna hand rolls. The spicy tuna hand roll must be specifically requested; spicy tuna and rice portions are small, but the seaweed used is good. Try the hand roll if you like tuna, but I recommend staying away from everything else. I've lived in Shanghai with the bad air and street food cooked with gutter oil so I have a strong stomach, but I'm pretty sure it was the weird tasting tuna and salmon poke that caused me to have diarrhea several hours later. BEWARE

They had 2 separate areas where you can find the crab legs. It makes it nice since there isn't a huge crowd fighting for crabs. The crabs were okay. I had some that I just ate ice. The crab itself didn't have much flavor. I just dipped the crab into some butter and added lemon juice on, but other than that, it was just okay. 

The meat was good. They had prime rib and kobe beef that I loved. 5\/5 for sure!

I think my favorite party of the entire buffet...was the salad bar. Sadly, it was only because everything else just alright. They have a selection of three greens and a variety of toppings and dressings. Oil and vinegar are on the side of the bar. Definitely get some salad and add some prime rib pieces into it. It'll make your night, since everything else...won't.

Dessert was just alright. I didn't finish anything. Portions are small, which is nice, so you don't feel like you've wasted too much food when you don't finish. There is a pretty big selection.

Coming from someone who has been a devoted fan of the Buffet at Bellagio since the very beginning, it hurts how bad the quality has gone DOWNNNNN! Maybe I'm over exaggerating just a tad bit, but I do know for a fact that they have downgraded on the quality of their meats and crab legs. I mean, it's not THAT BAD - like the Rio which is, in fact, a piece of $hit!! I first started noticing the change a year and a half ago?.. Warned my parents before they made their yearly trip and of course, I was right.

Then I thought, well maybe I should try it again? But it was the same thing. So disappointing... did not enjoy the crab legs as much as I use to. They were a little on the COLD and salty side. The prime rib was dry and full of non flavor. 

Call me bias, but if your crab legs SUCK, you will suck. I mean, who doesn't want crab legs when you go to a Vegas buffet?? 

HOWEVER, crab legs ASIDE, food is alright. I guess the best part of the Bellagio is the dessert station.

Seriously??? If you did come for the gourmet dinner at $40-45 I would be pretty choked that I had to get my own water and coffee. 
They really should just leave a bussing cart on the floor for people to leave their empty plates on their way to the buffet as the servers who aren't busy getting you beverages can't even be bothered to remove your empty plates. And having to listen to the snickering and comments from the servers to each other when paying customers leave and don't leave enough of a tip or none at all ( I didn't see what was left). So rude. Keep your comments to yourself until you are in the back with your coworkers. 
After hearing so much about the buffet I am utterly disappointed and will not return to this buffet. I won't even get into the basic food options I can find at any other standard buffet. Should not be on the top 5 list at all.

Who knows.

I ate at the Bellagio Buffet on my first day here in Vegas. My friend and I tried to cheat the system -- we wanted to make it right before lunch ended and dinner began, so we'd avoid paying dinner prices. Apparently, everyone and their mother was doing the same. We got there at 2:45, and didn't get seated until 3:30, lol. 

Now, I don't know how much dinner at The Bellagio usually costs -- since we weren't able to pay a cheap lunch price, so I was expecting to pay ... $30 at the most for dinner, on a Wednesday. But nope! Because of the ""holiday"" season, dinner on a weekday (I'm not sure if it's the same for weekends) cost an eye-opening $45\/person! Yup, $97 for two people. I had to dip into my gambling budget to pay for dinner, and when the cashier handed me back my receipt, I was expecting a room key or something with it, because I seriously couldn't believe I spent $100 for dinner on a Wednesday, and I didn't get anything else. But again, I'm the type of person who tries to get into buffets right as lunch ends to avoid paying dinner prices, so no judgment. 

We wanted to stay at the buffet for at least two hours to get our moneys worth, and that we did. My friend and I went through about four and five plates each, plus dessert. The buffet has A LOT of food. I think after my third round, I was trying to find a fork, and discovered another section of the buffet that I had missed, lol. I didn't notice any Mexican food (I was hoping for a taco station or something!), but they had lots of pasta (fettuccine, tortellini, ravioli), lots of DELICIOUS pizza, lamb, steak, turkey, Asian \/ Thai food, some American ... they had sushi, which I did not like. (I've decided that I just can't bring myself to like the sushi served at buffets -- I prefer the 'All You Can Eat' sushi route instead of the 'buffet' type of thing). The desserts, I think, were more pretty to look at than they were to eat. They were good, but nothing really stood out. Or maybe I was just really full from the food and couldn't appreciate it.

So all in all, this buffet is just okay. I'm definitely going to try the Wynn's Buffet soon to settle this rivalry between the two. Whatever expectations you have of the Bellagio's Buffet, just take it down a couple of notches and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",0,0,0

First off, the decor is laughably bad. Really killed the ambiance for me. I mean, the food can be luscious, but when you have to look up at ugly cream wallpaper and tacky mismatched china-as-wall-art, it takes away from the experience. 

Now, the nitty gritty: the food. Frankly, I was extremely underwhelmed. I go to a buffet for the sheer variety of food. I don't go to create one plate of meat & potatoes, a salad and a dessert. I like to go get a scoop of everything. Here, that added up to maybe 3 plates-worth of different dishes. Not a whole lot, comparatively. Some items were stand-outs though. I kept going back to the sushi bar again and again. Their sweet soy sauce is delicious and the fish was fresh.

I did a lot of buffet research prior to our Vegas trip.  I narrowed my short list down to Studio B at the M Resort, the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace, and the Bellagio Buffet.

We went during lunch time and visited each of them and asked for a walk through.  

If you really like seafood and a variety of weird things...  I would go to the Bacchanal Buffet.

If you want value and don't mind driving out of the Strip I would go to the Studio B buffet at the M Resort.  I really liked this buffet and the low prices, but it wasn't quite up to my expectations of a really nice buffet!

The Bellagio Buffet exceeded my expectations.  We arrived at 3 PM and left at 5:30, we enjoyed a leisurely meal with each other and all of the food was outstanding.  The atmosphere made up the difference between the other two buffets we were considering.  Even their silverware is top quality!  It is relatively quiet and the food was very fresh.  We had a lot of variety from meats, salmon, Asian, desserts, Mexican, breads, salads, and so much more!

No ""special"" dishes.  It was all omelets, salad, pasta, pizza.  I might as well have eaten at the Circus Circus buffet or Sizzler.

We had very great food the last 2 times we visited the buffet, so we went again this time we visited vegas. However, we felt disappointed this time as we think the food quality overall was not as good this time.

The desserts are all great, but the meat and entree were just ok. And we are meat eaters......so that's why we were disappointed. They did have more variety and meat choices for the gourmet buffet (Fri and Sat only), they had kobe sirloin, grilled quail, prime rib, beef wellington, lamb rack, ostrich, duck breast, etc for the gourmet buffet. However, they are all too bloody raw except beef wellington and ostrich. In the past, usually there would be options to choose from medium rare to medium well, but this time everything is medium rare except beef wellington and ostrich. The chef who was serving lamb rack was nice enough to grill the lamb to the degree that the customer requested, however, the one who served kobe sirloin and prime rib was probably too busy to cater people's requests, so everyone got a piece of raw meat. I passed by many people's table and noticed that they gave up on the raw meat after the rim (usually is more cooked) has been eaten. It's just a big waste of food when they serve meat that is too raw. So in a sense, I like Wynn better for the meat, but the dessert at bellagio buffet is un-beatable. I think if someone is going for a really nice piece of meat, then Wynn is better. If you are all for the desserts, then bellagio is the place to go. 
But I do feel disappointed at the bellagio buffet when comparing with our past bellagio buffet experience.

A few weeks ago, I took a trip to Las Vegas for a pharmacy conference, and was craving good quality food for good price. I was already sick of the outrageous prices of food in ""fast food"" places in the Venetian (having spent nearly 10 dollars on a coffee and a bagel), I was craving good quality food. A friend suggested we take advantage of the lunch prices before 4pm (making it a lunch-dinner pit stop), so I followed them to The Bellagio.

We paid around 25 bucks, and it was well worth it. There was SO MUCH SELECTION. The meats were great, from the Kobe steak, prime rib, bbq pork, and Mmmm, my fave of the night, BBQ ribs. Also, there was a huge selection of seafood, from the crab legs, shrimp, and all types of fish (sea bass, salmon, tuna, etcera). The fish itself was cooked a bit too much, so it was dry, but after eating the mussels, I was satisified. 

They also had an ETHNIC section, with Chinese and Japanese food. I don't normally touch ""Chinese"" food at buffets, so I didn't this time, but saw they even carried duck! I tried the sushi bar they had.. they even had HAND ROLLS... which was an okay quality grade.. but man, for a buffet? it was pretty worth it.

My absolute favorite part of the buffet was the DESSERT. Yes, you're not going to find the best amazing desserts, but the SELECTION was insane. My fave was a hazelnut chocolate mousse cake and the carrot cake. There were cheesecakes, cookies, more cakes, ice cream, sorbet, lemon bars, eclairs, etcera. I had to get a coffee at the end to eat with all my desserts.

Service was good as well, as every time I got up, the waiter took my plate away. Also, he was good on keeping my drinks fully supplied, which I appreciated. I just raised my hand, and he came instantly. Good job on the service.

I would have given this place 5 stars, based on the meat, but the seafood was not the greatest, nor the sushi. Nonetheless, probably one of the best buffets I've been to! Next time, I'll go for brunch.",3,0,0

Now onto the food - yuck. I tried A LOT of food and the only reason I feel OK giving this place one star was because the roast turkey was awesome. Aside from that here is my run down: Mac and cheese = dry. Bread = stale. Prime rib = flavorless. And the crab legs tasted like they had just been defrosted - horrible!!!

So i waited for dessert hoping that it would redeem this buffet. At the end of the meal, my mom goes ""the pastry chef should be fired, how do you fuck up chocolate?"" .

Just.... 

Just do yourself a favor and come to this buffet for brunch. It's so. good. If you are in Vegas, and you need a big meal to fill you up for the day, for the love of food COME TO THIS BUFFET! 

We went Sunday morning around 11:30ish and the line was crazy long. But if you take turns gambling on the nearby slots while you wait, it's not so bad. Just make sure you still have money to pay for the buffet, because it's pricey. FOR SURE make sure you have an extra $5 (that's right, FIVE DOLLARS) to make it a champagne brunch. You'll get the choice of both breakfast and lunch, so if you take your time, you can really have two meals while you're there.

Nothing is more American than a buffet. Especially this buffet, where you can get breakfast AND lunch AND dessert. So load up that plate full of things you'll take 2 bites of, and live that American dream!

To top it off, they even serve caviar to make you feel like you're part of the 1%.

Months before the trip, I had been researching and reading tons of reviews on different restaurants and bars. I know I wanted to do at least one buffet, and for the most part, the internets told me to go to the Bellagio Buffet. 

Me and my boyfriend went on a Saturday night, and it was pretty disappointing. 

First, we had to wait about twenty minutes. It's not a long wait, but when we finally were seated, we passed probably abut 20 empty tables. I'm not sure if this has to do with being under staffed, or if it has to do with them saving tables for the 'invited guests', but I felt the twenty minute wait was unnecessary. 

Then getting through the buffet line was a hassle in itself. There wasn't a lot of open space between the dessert island and the actual buffet. It was like a herd of cattle trying to make their way to the food. The layout of the buffet is good, it just needs to be more spread out.

And then there's the issue with the carving stations. I think this was one of the reasons why the buffet area was so congested. The people handling the carving stations were half assing it. They weren't working diligently to help people. They would carve some meat for someone, then walk away. Or they would be handling two different carving stations. Once again, I'm not sure if they were understaffed, but it was 6 pm on a Saturday. The Buffet should know to expect a lot of people during this time and should plan their staff accordingly. 

I was willing to ignore the wait and the layout of the buffet, because I felt the food would make up for the wait. Wrong. 

First, I was really excited to try Kobe Beef. I've never had it. So this was the first thing I went up and got. So I bring it back to my table, and the only knife I have is a lousy butter knife. I went up to look for a steak knife, and they didn't have any. Have you ever tried to cut steak with a butter knife? Butter knives are not meant for steak, hence they are called butter knives, and not steak knives. 

Anyway... I was determined to try kobe beef, so I battled on with this butter knife. Wikipedia says that Kobe beef refers to the meat as ""generally considered to be a delicacy, renowned for its flavour, tenderness, and fatty, well-marbled texture."" At the Bellagio however, the meat was really tough. I struggled with my butter knife to cut this piece of flesh, and when I was eating it, I felt like I was eating warmed up raw meat. It was not tender at all, and I had to chew it a lot. Maybe I'm food retarded, but I didn't think this meat was anything to praise. I didn't even finish it.

Next up, I tried the prime rib. I love a good prime rib. The prime rib at the Bellagio Buffet was very fatty and very generic as far as buffets go. I still ate it, because I like prime rib...but it was still ehhhhh. I had better prime rib at Ellis Island. 

I had some other assorted food, that was all very meh. Yes they have all you can eat crab legs, but they were cold and there was hardly any meat to each leg. Yes they had cold shrimp, but I can get that anywhere. 

The desserts weren't that great either. This was another thing I was looking forward to. I had been drooling over yelp pictures for weeks before I went to Vegas, however, when I was finally at the buffet, I felt like there wasn't as much of a selection from what I saw on the pictures on yelp.

Anyway, this buffet was average. It should have probably been about ten dollars cheaper. If you want good quality  food, you might as well go to a regular restaurant for the same price.

When we finally sat down, we saw many open tables because line management is very poor (they were seating strictly in order without trying to find parties to match open tables.)

Food was generally decent but unexceptional and not worth the long wait. Rack of lamb had nice seasoning but the first cut I was given was badly overcooked. ""Kobe beef"" was a joke - it was a cheap cut of meat, tough, with no marbling, and very very salty on top. I've had real Kobe-style beef, and Bellagio's version was not even remotely close. Quail was good, if maybe a bit light on the seasoning. The rest, honestly, was not really memorable. You won't find any bold or exciting flavors here, but for the most part, the food is competently prepared.

Service was awful. Victor took a long time to notice that we sat down, and he didn't manage to get drinks to our table (only 2 people) until long after our first trip to the buffet.  After that, he never returned to check on us or clear empty plates. I made three trips to the buffet after finishing my drink, and I got a refill only after finally waving Victor down and giving him a dirty\/questioning look.  He seemed much more interested in doting on tables with young kids than providing good service across all his customers.",1,0,0

You can also use your M Life rewards card to pay off the buffet, and include a credit card tip when paying as well. It wasn't too packed around 3 PM, and we were starving! We started with the salad bar, and then the side dishes for the meat, some pasta, some Chinese food, and the sad sad sushi bar. Lastly, the dessert bar.

So the Bellagio buffet is smaller than I had imagined, and isn't fancy inside like the Wynn. Our server was nice, brought us our drinks, and constantly took away our plates. So salad bar was typical, the sides we enjoyed were the broccolini, mashed potatoes and turkey gravy (a bit on the salty side), and the creamed spinach. I actually did not eat any of the meats, so I cannot vouch for that. The pastas were all overcooked and no good. I also noticed they had a lot of pesto options available, which is one of my favorites, but it was just mediocre. The pizza selection...there were about 8 different pizzas, but all were just drab. The pesto shrimp was the only one that was okay. The pepperoni was incredibly greasy and had a funky smell to it. There was a bacon and onion thin crust and it tasted so off. I also tried a vegetarian one with goat cheese, spinach and mushrooms, just okay too. 

The Chinese selection was the typical chow mein, fried rice, bok choy, and wonton soup. Chow mein and fried rice, just your typical buffet options. My friend said the wontons tasted like cardboard, so I didn't even try. 

Sushi...for lunch, all they had was california roll and vegetable rolls. At dinner time, they put out salmon and tuna nigri, and salmon and ahi poke salad. The salads were swimming in a sea of the Chinese hot sauce, and that's all it tasted like. I had my friend try, and she spit it out. 

We rolled into dinner time, and there wasn't that huge of a difference, except there were more people coming through. They brought out the king crab legs, and I never get this, but decided to, hoping something would redeem for this crappy experience. My crab was frozen. I let it thaw, and showed my friend the ice chips falling off. She got a non-frozen piece but said it was too salty. 

Desserts, ample selection. Their bread pudding is pretty good. Carrot cake is so sweet and not good. Eclairs have chocolate inside too, so too chocolate-y. The key lime tart was not good.

I had been to the buffett at Bellagio years ago for brunch and didn't recall it sticking out as extraordinary but didn't remember it being bad either. We stay at Bellagio regularly but for some reason I hadn't been back to the buffet until this last trip. I wasn't too impressed. 

The line was fairly long, which is fine, but as we got closer to the front we could see tons of tables and it seemed like they were purposely keeping the line long. Perhaps they do that to make it more appealing to passers-by ""oh it must be good, look at the line!""

The food selection was plentiful, if you can't find something to eat given all the choices there's something wrong with you. I love prime rib and it was tastey but the slices were pretty small. They had some good mushroom ravioli going on and the vegies were nice and fresh. So I will say the entree was good, both plates worth....

The desserts were surprisingly bad. None of us in our group liked the dessert. It should be noted that we are not food snobs by any stretch and we enjoy a good dessert as much as the next person. BUT, when going to a buffet in an establishment the caliber of Bellagio I'd expect the desserts to knock my socks off. They didn't.

The selection is much smaller than I expected, and quite honestly, it reminded me of a very upscale Hometown Buffet. Don't get me wrong: they have some gourmet items here, like a variety of meats and a nice offering of seafood, but nothing to get overly excited about. Except maybe the macarons.

Surprisingly, this buffet's seafood selection was close to awesome. I usually avoid eating seafood when visiting landlocked states, but everything was great! Loved the miso-marinated bluefin - it was fork-tender, if a little undercooked. Their spinach salmon was tasty, as was their spicy tuna poke and crab legs. 

Their meats, however, made me a bit sad. I'm a wimp and prefer my steak medium...and if I'm feeling particularly savage, medium rare at best. Everything here was moo-rare: the prime rib, the kobe, the flank steak...Nothing says ""yum"" like a river of blood flooding the rest of your food! My asparagus, broccolini, and mushrooms were probably tasty, except I couldn't really discern any flavor other than blood. Nice.

Moving along. Their desserts were all delicious and beautifully presented. Le macarons, creme brulee, sorbet, and chocolate dome cake were all fantastic.

Positives
- Crab legs, for the lunch price :D
- I love eggs, bacon, sausage! give me brunch anywhere any time.
- Our waitress was super nice, and had a southern accent. She thought we were weird cause we were just sitting around, not eating at a buffet, waiting for 3:30 until the crab legs came out. 

Average\/In the middle
-  Creme brulee was pretty good. I've had better though. 
- Your standard steaks and filets you can find anywhere else.
- I did like the one bite of pasta I took for my plate.

Negatives
- The rest of the food didn't really stand out to me.
- Sushi was left out a while, so it didn't taste fresh. 
- Not enough saffron in the seafood paella.
- Chocolate macaron was crunchy and it cracked...That's not supposed to happen for a macaron.

Food: Gourmet Dinner on Friday and Saturday is so delicious. There are some great items they served like kobe beef, beef wellington, prime rib, some seafood, etc. Dessert were so good too. 

Service: Not bad at all. The server was very nice. No questions asked!!!

Cost: For Gourmet Dinner is $39.99\/person. There's actually no kids pricing at all, since Bellagio has a very strict policy on children even with their parents being at the resort as non-register hotel guest.

Our server wasn't the greatest, but the other workers we encountered were very nice, like the round man carving the meat who convinced me to try both the Kobe and flank steaks, promising me that I ""wouldn't get big"". That flank steak was amazing, by the way. The kobe was a little on the raw side, but we still happily ate it. 

I was in heaven. SO much good food. Smoked scallops, crab legs, calamari salad, smoked salmon, shrimp pesto pizza, ohhh I could go on for days. The sushi rolls were the only bad thing. They tasted like they were either a few days old or shipped in from the nearby Winco. Yuck. Nigiri was good though! 

The desserts were delicious, too. The creme brulee was definitely the best! As usual, the Husband and I sampled just about every dessert offered. 

Husband also mentioned that he thought I ate more than he did. This is probably true. I didn't have a food baby, I had food triplets. I was in some serious pain afterward, but it was so worth it.

Food offered was ""ok"" by cheap buffet standards but there was absolutely NOTHING special about it and I mean NOTHING. The local Indian Casino, Mohegan Sun near my house in Connecticut has a better buffet and the buffet at Aria puts this to shame.

Service was awful and staff was about as friendly as I would expect in a registry of motor vehicles office.

I mean, you *are* in Vegas--might as well eat at one of them while you're here. The Buffet at Bellagio is accessible through the hotel's casino; the entrance is in front of a row of slot machines and near the Cirque du Soleil souvenir shop.

PRICE and WAIT: $35.99 for dinner on a Tuesday. You have access to a solid selection of seafood, grilled meat, and a variety of other dishes spanning a handful of cuisines. I arrived at around 2:45pm (right before dinner), and waited for roughly 45 minutes to be seated; 30 minutes was waiting just to pay, while the remaining 15 minutes was in another line to be seated. There were four parties ahead of mine, so the wait wasn't too bad. M Life members have their own line, but the regular line actually moved faster for some reason.

A lot of people say there is a strict two hour limit at the buffet. As someone who has dined here recently, I can confirm that is *not* necessarily true. The receipt will state that the staff encourages you to take up to two hours to enjoy the food, but no one will walk up and tell you to leave if you go over a few minutes. Just be mindful and courteous to those in line.

SELECTION: There is *no lobster at all* (except during holidays), there are no oysters or crabs, and their caviar bar (with champagne) is available only on the weekend at extra cost. There is, however, snow crab legs, an assortment of shrimp, an okay selection of sushi and sashimi, ahi and salmon poke, prime rib, roast beef, rotisserie chicken, meat loaf, a variety of sausage, brick oven pizza, more than a handful of Italian selections, probably one Indian dish, a handful of cooked Chinese dishes, a few vegetarian-friendly items, a salad bar, plenty of different types of rolls, and a pretty large selection of desserts among others. That may seem like a lot, but to be honest, the buffet area is actually not as large as Youtube videos make it appear and as other reviewers suggest.

If you're hungry and don't want to spend $55 at the Bacchanal or $105 at Sterling's, The Buffet at Bellagio is a great option.

I think the most important thing to mention about this buffet is their obvious emphasis on quality over quantity.  Sure, there aren't nearly as many options to choose from here as there are at the Carnival World Buffet or even at the Spice Market Buffet... but the care they put into preparing everything they serve is totally obvious.  There is not a single thing I ate here that I would not have ordered (and been fully satisfied with) as a stand-alone entree at a sit-down restaurant.

The meats at the carving station were nothing short of divine (they had the only moist, non-dried-out turkey I found on a carving station all week), the sliders were actually really good, my boyfriend loved the BBQ chicken and red onion pizza, the pasta dishes were great, and the desserts - OMG THE DESSERTS - were fan-freaking-tastic.  

Is that a soft-serve ice cream machine on the dessert bar?  No, no... it's actually got raspberry and peach sorbet inside.  

Those eclairs are definitely going to be mushy and previously frozen, right?... oh, no, no... they're moist, delicious, and full of chocolate cream.

the mac & cheese looked so old that it formed this hard layer on top, and people tried to break through it to desperately get the softer, creamier part within. 

the meat stations had meat that was SUPER red and undercooked. i do have to say, i got these ribs. i took one bite and it literally took 2 minutes to try and chew to make it swallowable. i had to just spit it out. 

their desserts are NOTHING compared to wicked spoon. there were things like carrot cake, brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. NO chocolate covered strawberries, nothing special or original at all.

i felt for this amount of money, the hype, the length of time, the mediocre service, and the quality of food, and lack of options- they deserve only one star.",1,1,1

We decided on Bellagio because we wanted to check out the conservatory, and see what the deal was with Bellagio-- figured we'd kill two birds with one stone-- touristy spot + Vegas buffet. 

We were greeted with a huge line, which seemed to be moving fairly quickly but still, wow. Was like a nighclub line! Luckily, someone who was leaving the buffet gave us a line pass which entitled us to skipping line- awesomeness! We didn't have to wait at all!

In terms of food variety, they deserve five stars, they have everything from sushi, to pork buns, lamb to turkey, salad to pizza. Has something for everyone for sure. 

What I did like: the spicy tuna hand roll, singapore noodles, potato cake, salad, fried rice, and unlimited coke. 

What was ok: The lamb was not that hot, the creamed spinach was okay, and the sushi was dry. 

The price was pretty good given the fact that it included drinks and a ridiculous spread of food- including desert. But it wasn't all high quality, hot food. Wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be.

And can someone please explain to me the weird game they have going on with the numbers?",1,0,1

After waiting nearly an hour to be seated, we were finally brought to a small table right near the sushi buffet.  The selection of food is enormous, and you'd be hard-pressed not to find something to enjoy.  Highlights for me were just watching people load up on the crab legs and shrimp cocktail (the ""smart"" buffet diners).  I'm talking PILES of the stuff.

It was impossible to try everything, but I was able to get a good sampling of the various cuisines.  Nothing really stood out.  The sushi was nothing to write home about, but I guess that's no surprise seeing as it's a buffet.  There were some decent pasta dishes (my weakness), and a nice selection of meats, including lamb and prime rib.  You can basically find everything here, which translates to everything just being average.

Our server was quite friendly though, and he kept the drinks filled and the table cleared.

Didn't try the prime rib but it was very rare so be forewarned if you don't like red meat.  Spicy tuna handroll was ok. Good selection of breads. Fruits weren't too sweet.

I had tried all the buffets on the strip and was very disappointed the good old days were gone, Bellagio and Wynn buffets  used to be the best, I still remember fondly the amazing dining experience with my Parisian brother, he said the Bellagio feast was such a culinary delight, an experience to remember. I might have to go to Bellagio, lake Como in Italy for the old experience. We had just come back from Cinque terre so we know what a good pasta should taste like.
The briskets and the tritips were still mooing, I had a bite, it was harder than my shoe leather, there were a variety of pastas but I did not see the simple spaghetti and meat balls, where were they? and why were there olives in almost every dish? not everybody liked olives, I hated them and that immediately excluded a lot of dishes for me, and what with all the weird herbs added to everything too. I'm from the old country and like herbs but not in everything, especially strong herb such as rosemary, I believe there was dill or sage added to the mayonaise, it made no sense, I have never had mayonnaise mixed with herbs, it does not go with cold cuts!!! where are the chefs at Bellagio coming from that are doing things that are not the norm elsewhere?
The BBQ tasted ok but it was a tad too sweet, most dishes were too sweet, the chef must have had a sweet tooth. The shrimp cocktail was fine BUT THE COCKTAIL SAUCE WAS TOO SWEET! it killed the shrimp and the king crab legs, not only it was sweet, it did not have enough if at all horse radish, it tasted like ketchup or ketchup with added sugar, it made zero sense to me. The lemon was crushed, still frozen, there was no juice left to extract out of, we need fresh lemon! The king crab legs were not big enough, it was more like queen or baby crab legs!
The plain chow mein was fine, the shrimp wonton soup was delicious, no wonder it was always out, I had to go back twice to get a bowl. 
The soppresata was also delicious but it also made no sense to me why it was placed next to the sweet papaya instead of mustard and mayonnaise, I went hunting for mayo and that was when i found the mayo was mixed w dill! I was looking for cornichons but there was none to be found.
I did not eat too many sweets, I spent too much time trying to chew the beef, we were just exhausted and wanted to go home. The deserts were pretty much tasteless, just like on the cruise ships now, no longer real whip cream, it was artificial stuffs out of a can, coloring and other subtitutes.

Pros:
- They have all you can eat shrimp cocktails. This is a good value for your money.
- Wide variety of foods from sushi, pasta, asian cuisine, seafood, fruits, desserts, etc.
- For ~$12 more, you can have all you can drink wines and certain mixed drinks like mimosas. 

Cons:
- Personally, I don't enjoy the old feel of the place. Our table was wobbly and the wallpaper was faded. Aria was much more modern but then again, Aria was built more recently.
- I was really disappointed at the wonton soup. There was a separate dish of shumai next to it and the wontons were literally shumais in bland soup. Quite embarrassing really.

* They do have king crab legs for weeknight dinners.  They were fresh and meaty, and very sweet after you ask the cooks at the fish station steam them for you.

* The miso-glazed sea bass with edaname couscous was cooked to perfection.  Perhaps first time a fish was not overcooked at a buffet.

* Prime rib was juicy and cooked well, as opposed to the Kobe beef, which I found dry like leather.  

* Some of the veggies (brocollini, asparagus) didn't seem as fresh this time.

* Roasted soya chicken was a mixed bag, I got a dried out breast while others got a decent drumstick.

*Everyone loved the sweet potatoe purée! Had some spicy kick to it.

* The raw bar was decent - spicy tuna hand rolls, beef tartare on dried bread, and both tuna and salmon nigiri.  Sushi rice fell apart in the mouth- my standard for quality!

* As for desserts, the pecan pie again shined; it's really hard to find a better version.  The Frangelico panna cotta was also amazing with a deep coffee-chocolately smooth texture.  Tiramisu was a bit too sweet however and a bit heavy on the cream and not enough chocolate and alcohol.

So if you are looking to try and bust the bank, then I recommend you eat at least 2 pieces of everything I just listed. Also included in the buffet: Salad, Soup and Bread... please don't eat this...if you wanted this don't come here go to the Olive Garden...you will save about 30 bucks. There were also several different pizzas and pastas. And it just keeps going...if you cant find something you like here then you way too picky. A few more items to mention: Pork Ribs, Mac and Cheese, vegetables, Spicy Beef, Asian Noodles...I'm full just typing all of this. And if you are still hungry there is a giant desert bar!

The waitress sat my party down and asked us what drinks we wanted. I asked for a soy milk and she rolled her eyes. I let that slide since it didn't really bother me. However, she then said with an annoyed tone ""are you serious?"" This really annoyed me cause I felt like she was judging me. She brought the drinks while I was getting food and told my friend that somebody had to go out of their way to get the soy milk. It doesn't matter if they have to go out of their way to get it because they are PAID to do their job and I also PAID for my meal.

Throughout the meal we also never got any refills unless we asked for it and at some point, nobody even cleaned up our plates. It really felt like we did not have a waitress at all.

However, the Bellagio has an exceptional buffet where the food was able to master the dichotomy of quality and quantity...I spent 2-3 hours in here, so let me share with you the tricks of the trade:

TIPS:
- Show up right before 3:30...prices till 3:30 are $20 bucks. Dinner food comes out around 3:45-4, but the price for that is double lunch--so get your $$$ worth!
- You can special order a lot of the displayed food items; just ask!

FAVES:
- King crab legs + drawn butter = my fave money item
- Lobster ravioli was to DIE for. I hate that phrase, but for once is apt...
- All the fish was cooked properly with awesome spices--try them ALL
- Anything with smoked salmon in here was mouth watering goodness
- I tried almost all of the desserts and liked them all (the flan was soso)... but cheesecake, key lime, hazelnut mouse, creme brulee, strawberry tart... oh my god.
- Flank steak and prime rib both cooked to perfection and well marinated
- Garlic pesto mash = the best way to go for potatoes

Okay I left this place in a food coma. I chowed down like there was no tomorrow...I ate a lot, and a wide variety at that. Despite my obese piglet-tendencies, this was still an elegant buffet, and it was done perfectly. I will most certainly eat here next time I go to Vegas, and you should too!

The Bellagio is the BEST I have found.  (Note I have tried the top ones - Paris, Wynn, Mirage)  They are all about the same prize.  Which I feel is a good bargain**.  I only go to either breakfast or lunch never done dinner.  That is just too white trash for me.

The range of food at The Bellagio is excellent and the quality is top notch. The serves is by far the fastest and most efficient.   The food stations are very clean and well organized.  The wait to get into the buffets is very reasonable.  
 
I would say the only draw back is that they don't change the menu.  We went in October and now just in June and it was the same dishes.  

Bloody Mary is excellent and so is the Ice Tea.

If you are a dessert person go to the Paris buffet they have better desserts and a crepe station.

The food was just ""ok"". It was edible, but nothing to go run home and tell your mother about it. The waffles were too hard and dry. The meats were extra fatty and very rare. The eggs were super runny. The breakfast sausage was good, but that's pretty hard to screw up. The pizza was ok too. The muscles were dry. The king crab legs were ok for buffet standards. The pork belly was juicy & delicious, They did not have too many options for desserts, just your standards, I tried almost one of everything but was only happy with the keylime tart. 

Overall I think the Belliago Buffet is more on the old school vegas vibe. With standard options. The newer hotel buffets on the strip (i.e. Cosmopolitan, Aira, etc) seems to give not only the standards but different variations of them as well as providing other unique options for the same price as this buffet.",0,0,0

But once we got inside, we were perfectly pleased by the variety, taste, and quality of the Buffet's options. Personal favorites: Kobe beef, pesto mashed potatoes, shrimp cocktail, sushi, crab legs, and prime rib. 

All in all, it was an absolutely decadent experience, where everything tasted so good that I ended up stuffing myself to a painfully uncomfortable fullness. My boyfriend and I are currently on a mission to sample every buffet in Vegas, and we rate this as a solid option.

In terms of sushi, their selections were very limited. However, I was very impressed with the quality of their fish. Their salmon and tuna sashimi pieces were very fresh, thick, and clean.

Everything else here tastes just mediocre in my opinion. I tried their pork ribs, prime cuts, and etc. but they tasted average. There wasn't any particular dish that really jumped out at me.

I did love their dessert section. They had a lot of different variety of desserts and for someone who doesn't like sweet stuff, I was impressed that I ended up eating all my dessert.

They advertised a ""Kobe steak"" bar, which I hit up on the first stop - I was excited about this, but unfortunately, this must not have been a good cut of kobe beef. First of all, I've had kobe beef ny strip steaks. You're probably looking at $90+ for a 12 oz steak. Whatever they were serving had no marbling of fat throughout the meat and it was dry and over cooked. Unfortunately, this steak was shadowed by their flank steak, which was much better prepared and more flavorful.

Anyway, they also had king crab legs, snow crab legs, rack of lamb, and chilean sea bass, to name a few other favorites. Overall, the food quality was good, and the variety that the buffet offers definitely is appropriate for the amount that you pay. I might add that you might want to stay away from the sushi bar though - really the only part I'd say wasn't very good.

The Bellagio has always been my favorite resort in Las Vegas because of its beauty inside and outside.

Presented upon entering the Bellagio's lobby is a lavish $10M  chandelier in the lobby created by glass sculptor Dale Chihuly. It is a   grand glass flower lighting display, comprised of 2,000 hand-blown blossoms, called ""Fiori de Como.""

The ""Fountains at the Bellagio,"" in front of the resort is an 8.5-acre lake with 1,214 jets that rocket streams of water 460 feet into the air. The dancing streams of water are illumined from within and shoot out sporadically to the beat of whichever song is playing. The jets of water twirl, shake, and spin. Not only are they are perfectly timed to the music, but also to the noise reactions from the surrounding audience.

The Buffet at Bellagio is touted as an ""experience like no other in Las Vegas."" I must refute that claim. The ""Fountains at the Bellagio"" are still one of the best free attractions in Las Vegas. However, the inside of the Bellagio has severely deteriorated over the last 20-years. The chandelier looks as though it has not been cleaned in that time period. The decor in the hotel, casino, and buffet need a facelift and update. The interior is old-looking, dingy, and weathered. This representation covers their buffet, too.

The pamphlets and advertisements we read indicated that we would be wowed by the talent on display at live-action cooking stations, but in actuality, the positions were nothing more than carving stations and servers restocking items. The marketing material focuses on their weekend champagne brunch and Gourmet Dinner Service where the prices skyrocket from roughly $30 for lunch to $45 for the Gourmet Dinner Service and $50 for the weekend champagne brunch, tax excluded which is 8.25% in Nevada.

Although the food was good, it was not what I remember as exceptional from 20-years ago. The variety of food items is limited compared to Studio B Buffet at the M Resort, which is less expensive and has 200+ exquisite meal items. Bellagio's Buffet was standard fare for any other buffet offered at any other resort in Las Vegas. It indeed should not be touted as one of the Top Ten Buffets in Vegas.

My recommendation is to go to Studio B Buffet at the M Resort in Henderson, Nevada if you are considering a buffet. You will not be disappointed. Make sure you use Uber and not a taxicab and do not use the Curb application which is ridiculous. A taxicab will cost you $90 round-trip for the 23 round-trip ride to the M Resort. Uber is significantly less. The buffet costs approximately $23 with tax included and worth every penny.",2,0,0

Bellagio buffet is awesome and I leave in a happy food coma every time. Here's the scoop:

Cost: Lunch (till 4pm) is $25 plus tip so $27, Dinner is $37 so around $40 with tip. On the weekends, unlimited champagne is an extra $5. For parties 8 and over they charge automatic 18% gratuity.

Service: Service was nice and friendly, as expected, nothing spectacular.

Food: Come for the food--there is almost limitless variety. My favorites include the shrimp cocktail, crab legs (use lemon from the shrimp cocktail area since there's no sauce), salmon and ahi poke, and the CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRIES. Basically, come for dinner (since out of my top four, only shrimp cocktail is available at lunch). I'm obsessed with the strawberries covered with milk\/white chocolate swirl. The other dessert options are good too--anything with chocolate is basically a winner and the bananas foster are great. The fruit tart is meh. They also have a good pre-made salad section and basically any kind of meat you can think of: prime rib, lamb, quail, turkey, pork belly, etc. Also, the sashimi at dinner is fresh and delicious, only california rolls at lunch. 

This may be one of the pricier buffets in Vegas, but I think it definitely delivers.",1,0,0

Some of the desserts which were offered were not available. People were waiting to some dishes to be refilled and the staff who were manning the areas where less than enthusiastic towards the waiting dinners.

For comparison, I also went to Wicked Spoon of the Cosmopolitan. Bellagio definitely has a wider selection, but loses in the uniqueness category. 

The pros:
-Good sushi selection\/quality. I murdered a whole school of fish during my consumption of salmon sushi. 
-Decent seafood variety
-Numerous red meats available. -1 point for the abysmal kobe beef. How embarrassing. 
-Delicious creme brulee. Inhaled at least 5 of these. 

The cons:
-Front end staff. 
-Limited ""speciality"" items and ethnic food. 
-Besides the creme brulee, desserts were mediocre.

That is, assuming it's a good one, which The Buffet at the Bellagio seems to still have (100 people waiting in line!).  It's just a shame that the food can't back that up anymore.  While they were pretty darn good the last time I was here, The Buffet now seems to be living off its reputation more than anything else.

Although there were about 40 people in line when we arrived (it more than doubled by the time we left), we were able to bypass the wait by making a reservation.  The trade off was a fixed 18% gratuity, but it was well worth it to get in that much faster and to have all 12 of us seated together.  Plus, we probably would have tipped that much anyways.

On the plus side, there was a wide variety to choose from.  Like nearly every other Vegas buffet, there were sections for Asian food, sushi\/sashimi, seasonal fruits, various salads, pastas, pizzas, and seafood (including fresh king crab legs).  In addition, they also had a couple of carvery stations offering meaty favorites like prime rib, Kobe beef, ribs, pork belly, and rack of lamb, as well as stations for made-to-order tacos and caviar.  And, of course, a dessert bar with a wealth of selections to cap your meal.

While all that variety was great, it was also necessary in order to find things worth eating.  Most of the food was just okay with a handful of tasty items, but the carvery meats were really disappointing though - the prime rib was okay and the rack of lamb was good, but the Kobe beef was AWFUL (tough and flavorless).  Furthermore, the tacos were pretty bleh, two of the three caviars were just tobiko and ikura (like at Japanese restaurants), and the sashimi didn't look appetizing at all.

At $39 a head for a regular Saturday night dinner, the price is comparable with the better buffets on the Strip (Wynn's buffet and Cosmo's Wicked Spoon, for two), but the food felt like it was a step or two behind.  TWO AND A HALF STARS rounded up because things like the salmon mousse cups, smoked salmon, chocolate covered strawberries, and rack of lamb were ""plus"" items.  Plus, a part of me just hopes that it was a bad night.  However, if I had to paid out of my pocket (the resort credit I got for staying at the Bellagio covered my meal), I would have rounded down.",12,9,9

Came here while on vacation and planned it so we got in 30 minutes before they switched to the dinner menu. = $20 for the dinner menu!!! FTW

Snow crab and king crab legs were much better here than at the Wynn. Tasted fresher and sweeter. Corn on the cob was ridiculously sweet (good thing)

Prime rib wasn't as good as the Wynn but it was still really good. They offered Kobe beef but it didn't taste like the melt in your mouth kobe beef that I expected.

I thought the salad and cold food selection was fantastic, my favorites were the seaweed salad and the lady making you personal spicy tuna hand rolls.

The 10 year decline...
-Lobster ravioli morphed into mushroom ravioli which then just recently morphed into cheese ravioli. Doh!
- Mango floating islands became some apple dish in a glass.
-Rack of lamb (which is my favorite protein) is really gamey tasting, gray and under-seasoned...like it should have been tossed 2 days earlier. This is the 3rd time I've found it as such (should probably knock it off the menu).
-The macaroons used to be big and pillowy, moist and fresh...now they're small and nothing special
-Chilean sea bass turned into barramundi (recent downgrade)
-Peeled shrimp went from extra large to large (changed a while ago)

To top things off, the food poisoning! I literally had to sprint for the bathroom upon leaving...I'm blaming the salmon and tuna poke on that one...I know the tuna wasn't fresh...and it's hit me the last two visits. Fool me twice, shame on me.

What worked:
-Decent prime rib
-King crab (they will heat it up for you in the back near the Mexican station)
-Pesto mashed potatoes are spot on
-Service is always pretty good
-They added a caviar station near the ""run for your life"" poke
-Value...you can still go right before dinner and pay the lunch price if you time it right. Hashtag winning.

A very wide variety of cuisines that were all excuisite in flavor!

It was one of the best brunches I had ever eaten.  Alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression.  I brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet I remembered.  

Well, we got off to a bad start.  My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant.  At the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  Because it was mom's birthday, I went with it, but I was annoyed.  No child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. They want the pizza and dessert and not much else.  Of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so I paid for him to sit there and be cranky.  My bad.

As for the adult meals, the food was fine.  I had prime rib, which was only OK, but the mashed potatoes were awesome.  My mother had the crab legs which she loved.  We must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last.  The waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water.  

Really the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal,  but I just can't help but feel like we over paid.  There was nothing remarkable offered.  The service was iffy, the food was unexceptional.  Well, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.  I'm just not feeling the love for this place this time.",2,0,1

During lunch, they were making omelets, and on my second or third round, I definitely got myself one of those.

My family and I are occasional visitors of Las Vegas resorts. Occasional as in, at least once every other year. Came this past week for an early birthday celebration for my dad. We stayed in Bellagio and dined at this buffet twice this trip. And there is always a line!

So here is my TIP: Get a MLife card people! Once you reached past the beginners card, you can skip the long line at the buffets and go to the front. It probably saved us hours (no exaggeration). You also receive points on your card when you dine here (make sure you give it to them to slide).

Weekday lunch review: Used the Mlife card to bypass the long line. Super crowded. I would come before 11AM since it would be considered breakfast time and stay for both. There is a omelette service station with crab legs, shrimps as options. Eggs Benedict, salads, pizza, cocktail shrimps, carbs (pasta, bread, bagels), desserts (same as dinner), ice cream, sushi (few options), soups.

Weekday dinner review: Snow crab and king crab legs!! Prime rib (overcooked), ham (salty), rack of ribs (not bad), forgot what type of beef they had at the craving station but it was good, cockshrimps, pizza (why would you..), salad, 5 types of soups, dessert, ice cream machine, sushi, fruits, pasta, lots of fish, tuna and salmon poki. I had a food baby that night. As I recall from trips before, the Wicked Spoon had better options for desserts. Dessert isn't the best here nor special. Overall it's a good buffet though.",12,1,2

Salad bar is fully stocked, whether you make your own or the pre-fixed offerings they have. On a side note they have hard boiled eggs! These go great with my usual spinach salad w\/turkey from the carving section. Carving section has the regulars & something different. Last I went it was ostrich & duck. 

Sushi is a plenty, not just rolls, some ngiri. But I go for the tuna & salmon poke, along with seaweed salad. After that I'm always a sucker for pizza & cocktail shrimp. Then some prime rib. All of which is top notch. 

The dessert section cracks me up, it's the center of the buffet & every time I'm there it is predominantly surrounded by women. You notice how fragrant the area is compared to everywhere else.

Old Review 11\/6\/07:

Being a buffet fan, and after hearing so much hype about Bellagio Buffet being the #1 Buffet in Vegas I was curious, and hit it up with a group of friends last saturday (11\/3\/07).  I'll admit I was a little worried hearing that it was not worth it and costs around $50. To tell you the truth it was more like $35 plus tax&tip. So it really wasn't that much more expensive than the supposed ""cheaper"" options like The Spice Market in PH\/Aladdin (which is still an excellent buffet). On to the food:

The Good:  Alaskan King Crab Legs (plentifull, in three locations, always stacked high so you didn't have to wait forever for 80 year old women to take all the ""good"" ones. I highly recommend taking a place to get heated up..tasted 10x better). Lobster ravioli, rack of lamb, Prime rib, Braised short ribs, mashed potatoes, stir fried baby bok choy, all the desserts, the salad (hard to screw up), and the decor of the restaurant. 

The mediocre: The chinese food, and the beef wellington.

The bad: I don't expect great sushi at a buffet, but the sushi sucked..and the rice with it was smashed so much it looked & tasted like mash potatoes made of rice...or solidified congee. and the fish on top was dried out and nasty. And the mac&cheese (how hard is it to screw up?!?) sucked too.

Service: This also sucked. They took pretty much forever to get us any drinks and refills, and clearing off our table took forever. We had one waitress for ten people, and she was VERY rude to us as well. On top of that because we had over 8 ppl, we were charged an automatic 18% gratuity, which is A LOT for a buffet considering you get your own food? and the service sucked..I was almost going to talk to a manager to get my gratuity lowered or refunded completely, but I didn't want to deal with the BS. I expected much better service especially from a place being run in the Bellagio.

Overall: The food quality was very good, it's only really a little pricier than neighboring Buffets, but the quality is 3x better. Although I will say it's still a buffet, so it's about variety and quantity, so if you don't eat much..spend your money else where on a very high quality single plate of food. I'd probably visit again hoping for better service, so 4 stars. Although get there early..when we left, the line was long as hell.

$25 for regular brunch\/lunch or $30 to add champagne, which isn't bad at all.

I wouldn't recommend eating any carbs here - french toast, waffles, bread, cheese blintz etc. No, not even the banana stuffed french toast. They're all so meh - like i'm sure you could make better ones yourself. The custom omelets were fine but they definitely overdo the cheese. Skip the breakfast sausage - they look delectable but they're so tough and very dry (sad panda). Regular bacon was solid though.

Definitely go for the fish (Bluenose and Salmon) and any of the hand-carved meats (Prime Rib, Hand-Carved Bacon). Don't bother with the Green Curry Duck, though - looks disgusting and no taste whatsoever. Breakfast sausage was terrible and dry. The spicy tuna hand rolls were tasty. Desserts are typical buffet quality with the chocolate eclair being the standout.

It is really quite simple: First, I think the dishes they offer aren't super appealing, creative or diverse, and then, the dishes that are available don't taste fresh and delicious. Yes, they have a nice selection of carving stations and crab legs, but that can only take you so far. I tried substandard creamed spinach, relatively tasteless Chinese broccoli, and overly sweet, sweet potato mash. I think they must have added sweetener.

The problem is, buffets never have anything I actually like.

Things I Don't Like or Rather Not Eat Because It's Totally Not Even That Good So Why Would I Have More Than One Serving Of It:

- Any kind of breakfast food: seriously. Why. Why would you eat several eggs. Eggs are plain, easy to make and cheap. A dozen eggs cost like $2.00 - $3.00. Think about it, you can have all the eggs you want at home. Why would anyone eat eggs at buffet?! Same goes with: toast, bacon, sausage, omelettes, etc.

- Prime Rib: Why do they name it prime rib? Tastes like Crap Rib. My bf loves it and I don't even know why. I feel so dirty after eating it.

- SMOKED Salmon: I've come to realize that its cheaper to serve gross smoked salmon than fresh sashimi quality salmon. PASS.

- California Rolls: Yes, I ate a bunch of this here (embarrassing, I know). They had 2 different types. Ones with the rice on the outside and ones with seaweed wrapped on the outside. oooh - ARE YOU SERIOUS.

- Magical Spicy Tuna Hand Roll: Homegirl made me a spicy tuna hand roll but it magically turned into a rice and sprout handroll. Where's the spicy tuna?

- Mac n Cheese: dude, no.

- Shrimp Cocktail: COSTCO STILL SERVES THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD.

- Any Kind of Pasta: Filler food.

- Mashed Potatoes: So creamy but I realized it was 5 parts butter, 0.05 actual potato.

- Desserts: They had a lot of desserts but nothing looked edible to me. 

Guess what kind of food The Buffet at Bellagio has?

Everything I can't stand apparently.

While the Wynn is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous inside...I feel like the Bellagio has an edge food wise.

Helpful Hints:
 - Dinner is pricey at $36.99 for weekends. Do what I do and come right before 4pm (which is when lunch ends) and pay lunch prices. 
Cheap I know..but I'm Asian.
- Crab legs here are CRAZY salty.

We arrived at 2pm on a Thursday and the line reached the telephones outside the restaurant.  It moved pretty steadily though, and my party of 4 was seated in 40 minutes.  In general, the service was pretty sloppy.  There were times when up to 6 dirty plates were piled up on our table and aside from iced tea, which they filled pretty regularly, I had to flag someone down to get another drink.

From the carving stations, I tried the flank steak, kobe, prime rib, chicken, and ribs.  The flank was marinated wonderfully and the ribs were awesome, but everything else was pretty meh, either over or undercooked.

The shrimp were plentiful and tasty, plus come pre-shelled.  The crab legs didn't come out until dinner and the line to get them was maybe 15 deep at first, but died down after about half an hour.  Tonight had both snow and king.  I didn't appreciate the fact that they're cut in half as much as I expected - you usually can't pull the meat out in one piece because there's a layer of cartilage in the middle.  Also, they didn't do a very good job defrosting them since most of my legs still had chunks of ice in them, but you can ask someone behind the counter to heat them up for you.

The lunch sushi options are pretty bare, but sashimi comes out at dinnertime.  Although I've seen ads of the buffet having dim sum, they only had BBQ pork buns.  I think there were four types of pasta and all but one was vegetarian.  The tortellini was really good.  I was also a fan of the pesto mashed potatoes.

The salad bar had a few premade salads, my favorite being the spinach and bacon one.  During lunch it had a bunch of deli meats and cheese, but they were taken away for dinner.  The mozzarella balls are a must-try!

The dessert station had about 30 options, all beautifully made and each approximately two-bite-size.  About 20 of them were little tarts or cakes, and then there was bread pudding, brownies, and cookies.  I saw three sugar-free options.  I probably shared about 10 desserts with my mom.  Everything was pretty good, but my favorites were the cheesecake, creme brulee, and key lime tart.  My sister was a huge fan of the fruit tarts and ate about six.

All in all, I felt like I got my $19.99 worth for lunch, but I don't know if it's worth the $29.99 for dinner.  However, given that it's generally ranked one of the top three buffets in Vegas, I feel like it's a bit overrated.

They have tiered pricing depending on what day of the week you go. 
M~Th dinner is $37 pp and F~Sun dinner is $42 pp.

There is a line no matter what day you go so be prepared to wait unless you're a Pearl M life member or higher.

There is a great selection of food to appease every taste bud but my absolute favorites were the grilled meat including the juicy prime rib and tender short ribs, crab legs, spicy tuna hand rolls, pasta, and their dessert station.

I took Kimberly K's awesome advice to take advantage of lunch prices for dinner.  So basically this was my first stop driving into vegas on a Tuesday and we arrived about 30 minutes before lunch was about to end.
Got in for lunch price at $20 and got to eat dinner as well, which is normally $30.  Paying for 5 people, it was a $50 savings!

Gourmet Dinner Fri\/Sat  4pm-10pm $37
Weekend Brunch 7am-4pm  $25    (with champagne = $30)

They had: CREME BRULEE, soft serve, banana foster, bread pudding, cute little cone things, carrot cake, tiramisu, cheesecake, chocolate cake, tarts, flan. Ofcourse these were not superb desserts like u would find at jean philippes. But for buffet desserts, i think this is way better than most. Way better than Wynn buffet, which i thought was bad overall. Didn't see any chocolate covered strawberries tho. :( 

Meats and Seafood:
Kobe Top Round, Prime Rib, Ham, Roast Chicken, Turkey. 
(my fave was the top round)
Snow Crab Legs, King Crab Legs, Shrimp Cocktail. 
*crab was a bit salty and not super fresh. but it really didnt' stop anyone for getting heaping piles of it. 

Other stuff they had was Salmon Teriyaki, Miso Chilean Seabass, 3 kinds of mashpotatoes including sweet potato- my fave was the pesto mash potatoes. A few different salads, which werent' that great. pasta salads, soups, chashu bao, salmon and tuna sushi and poke, CA rolls, sliders (meh), pizza, mac and cheese, sausage

The roasted meat selections are great (prime rib, turkey [free range btw], and if your daring venison). Love their King Crab legs, jumbo-sized shrimp cocktail and all the other sea-food selections they offer. As for sushi... well it's a buffet, what do you expect? Sushi are only good at an actual sushi restaurant.

At any rate, back to the good stuff of this buffet. Pizzas are rather decent, but their pasta selection needs a little more variety. Their salad bar is quite good, but I'm not at a buffet for salad. Still I had to try it since I want to write about it, hence not bad just quite good.

Now the dessert station. Two words, just amazing. They make some of the most creative desserts you will ever taste and they make it in numbers. The flaw is that they don't have a gellato bar.

I ended beefing up my plate with mostly seafood and items from the Chinese buffet station where the food was hot and flavorful.

I have a huge sweet tooth, so I had to hit up the dessert counter more than...er, twice.

I have this thing down to a science.  Some people know how to count cards, well I know how to bring down the house by attacking the buffet.  So let me lay my wisdom on you...

OK, first off, If you want to take Vegas, you need to follow some simple buffet rules.  1. No salad.  I don't care how good the dressing is, or how fresh it looks, or if it sounds good to you.  NO NO NO, that's like splitting 10's.  Someone fills one of their precious trips to the buffet with a salad, and I'm picking up my buffet chips and changing tables.  2. No Rolls or bread.  They are good here, everything is freshly baked, but it takes up way too much space and it's is a trap they want you to fall into.  Kind of like taking insurance when the dealer has an Ace showing.  3.  No sushi other than maybe a spicy tuna hand roll.  They aren't slicing fresh sashimi here.  It's all california rolls with lots of rice and little fish.  You are going to get better sushi elsewhere, so don't fill up on all that rice.

OK, so now we got some basic strategy down, I'll teach you my fool proof system.

Course 1 - Breakfast.  Go to the omelette station on the left and have them fire one up for you.  Take in all your options.  If you don't want to go standard with the fillings, notice they have crab meat and shrimp.  They also have spinach, basil, and cilantro for some extra seasoning.  You want to think outside the box, go get some smoked salmon and bring it to them to throw into an omelette.  Ok after you get your omelette, you grab an eggs benedict (which always has a perfect runny yolk center), some sausage, bacon if you wish.  And now here's why I said to go to the Omelette station on the left and not the right.  Next to the sausage is a small bowl marked Beef Tenderloin.  They don't have that on the right and I think few people notice it, which is their plan.  So now you have nicely seasoned slices of filet mignon to put some more scrambled eggs on top of for steak and eggs.  I call this course, eggs 3 ways.  Omelette, Scrambled, and Benedict.  Please notice we've avoided all french toast, waffles, and pancakes.  I'm sure they are good, but you'll ruin your other courses.

Course 2 - Cold Smoked Fish.  Ok here's a real tough one.  You can't get a bagel with this course, it takes up way too much room and violates rule 2.  So you grab lots of smoked salmon, smoked trout, maybe herring if you like it, and slices of tomato and red onion.  Use the slice of tomato as a base and construct ""open face"" sandwiches of the smoked fish using cream cheese to hold it all together on the fork.  Right in the center of the buffet are large chilled cocktail shrimp, try to use the shrimp as a barrier between the cocktail sauce and the smoked fish.  Although it's a little known fact that cocktail sauce and cream cheese tastes good together.

Course 3 - Meat.  Go up to the carving station have them slice you up some Prime Rib and roasted lamb.  Make sure they don't skimp on your slices here, speak up if it's too small.  The odds for making it back again are small and sometimes there is a line.  They know this.  To your right is another small carving station with Turkey and Pork Belly.  Make sure you get this and some cranberry sauce to hold a piece of turkey and pork belly together on the fork.  You have to get some potatoes with your meat and mashed is the best way to go.  By mashing it, they've done some of the hard chewing work for you.  By smearing some on each bite of meat, it goes down smoothly.  If you want flavor overload get the pesto mashed.

Course 4 - Odds and Ends.  So now walking around the buffet a few times you've seen some other things that catch your eye.  Now's the time to just throw whatever else you want to try on your plate.  Roasted chicken and saffron rice, BBQ glazed Salmon, Creamy Pasta with chicken and sun dried tomatoes, a few Lo Mein Chinese dishes,  couple of slices of pizza.  Now with the pizza, don't be afraid to take only a few bites of the slice then eat the rest of the toppings so you aren't violating rule 2.  The pizza is pretty good and there are usually about 5 or 6 to choose from.  Keep on the look out for a shrimp pesto one.

Course 4.5 - Back Up Plan.  Sometimes the Odds and Ends aren't that happening.  People don't pay as much attention to them, and sometimes they sit too long and get a little dried out.  Don't be affraid to throw in the towel and then double down on something you really liked earlier.  Sure there are starving people in the world and you may feel guilty about throwing a whole plate of food away that you barely touched, but they aren't going to get that plate of food anyway.  

Course 5 - Dessert.  Sample Everything, Finish Nothing!  When I'm done, my table looks the same as the dessert station, just with 1 bite missing.  Don't feel bad, remember what happened to the last person who told starving people ""Let Them Eat Cake",18,20,15

I ate here because I was in Vegas on an all expense paid work trip and I stayed at the Bellagio and meals were charged to the room. I do not even know how much the buffet was. 
But for me the quality is what impressed me. Most of the other buffets I have been to all of the flavors kind of mold together. At the Bellagio , the food was high quality and you could have some elegant separate meals not just one big sloppy mess like other buffets I have been to. The desserts were fabulous!

Admittedly, it was better than Todai, but that doesn't mean anything really...considering Todai is catering more towards the Asian style.

The orange juice, out of the buffets I've been to, was the best. However, I am still overall disappointed with American orange juice, it has that bitter taste I don't like.

The food itself, however, was average. Average does not cut it for a place that's $30 a head. The crab legs ranged from delicious (sweet) to disgusting (unbearably sour), depending on luck I assume.

-Show up around 10-10:30. Gives you enough time to sample some of the breakfast food and pretty quickly get the changeover to lunch, when they bring out some great savory options. 

-Skip the breakfast pastry bar. Middling quality and really just stomach filler. 

-Top items: spicy tuna hand rolls made to offer (comes out at noon); shrimp fresh rolls; grapefruit kale salad. Unsurprisingly they put these in a case with a staffed server rather than being open for grabs. 

-Runner ups: seafood ceviche (scallops and mangos); roast lamb; pesto mashed potatoes; smoked salmon; broccolini; like everyone says, crab legs are fresh and delicious. These come out at 11 and if you're one of the first to the display you can get some of the very large sized claws. 

-You can mix items from different stations to get new creations - like build your own sundae with bread pudding, caramelized peaches, soft serve vanilla bean custard and soft serve peach sorbet. Nom!

-Most of the bite sized pastries are only okay. The passion fruit guava tartlet with chocolate crunches on top is a diamond in the rough!",4,1,1

However, for some reason, the Bellagio bartenders love me and once again my friend and I were pulled out of line and asked if we wanted to sit at the bar. If someone asks if you ever want to sit at the bar, DO IT. Or you can wear heels, as that's the reason the bartender gave me when I asked how she picks people out of line.

I went for about 3 rounds (meat, sushi\/crab, dessert) and was fully stuffed. The Kobe beef was great, as was the prime rib. I'm a little impartial to lamb as I think my mother makes the best lamb ever, but it was still decent. The crab legs were ok, although I'm not necessarily a fan of chilled crab legs. I couldn't find any butter to save my life, and of course once I was done eating the guy next to me sat down with a big ass bowl of melted butter. Of course.

The desserts were delightful, I had a couple of their white chocolate cones, a chocolate cake with peanut butter stuff in it, and their key lime tart. I can't eat cheesecake, but they looked good as well.

The price is good for a high-line buffet, so I've got no complaints there. And there was definitely no shortage of food. So I raise my earlier review up a star, but would recommend going for lunch\/dinner instead of breakfast...breakfast isn't really worth it in my opinion.

The crab legs like the fact bad king crab legs instead of the snow crab legs. It easier get the meat and get more meat for your effort. If you want your crab legs heated up just ask the cook they do it for you. Maybe odd time or what not we went early nice no line just walked straight in.

The dessert selection flat out the worst. Nothing much choose from and the whole look terrible set up compare to the other top buffets. No eye appeal no desire get dessert but had to cause at buffet.

We got there early which was great since there seems to be quite a line otherwise.

I thought the carving stations were by far the best! All of the meat was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection! The salads actually are quite delicious too- and usually that's something I steer clear from in a buffet- but don't miss out! Desserts were excellent - my favorite being the Tiramisu. 

What to avoid:

Cold crab legs :\/ Ugh! What a disappointment, I usually love crab legs and I do not want them served on ice or re-heated for that matter. This alone was reason for minus one star. The sushi was also not very delicious. They had some sashimi which was a little mushy but I can't complain a lot here because I don't think sushi stands much of a chance when served buffet-style.",0,0,0

Our serve Wayne was so sweet, nice and quiet funny! He was on top of his game on refilling our drinks and clearing out our dirty\/empty plates. Which is something I look for at buffet services. He's definitely an awesome server. Request him if you can!

As for the food, they have a sushi area with a variety of rolls and nigiri it's delicious! You can also make your own hand roll! Just ask the person behind the sushi station. They also offer caviar! FAANNCYYY! Lol first time trying it, it's definitely a texture to get use too. 

They offer prime rib which is juicy and warm pink which you can never go wrong in having! For the seafood loves they have crab legs. UHH YUMMMM! Crab legs were easy to break off and the meat was soft, juicy, and meaty (depending the leg size). 

Their dessert section is pretty bigg! They have all kinds of cake slices, variety of macaroons, cookies, fruit tart, donuts, ice cream, anddddd it goes on and on. Haha

Since we did not want to wait at Caesar's Palace yet again, we headed out to the Bellagio during lunch time. We were surprised to see only a 15-20 person queue at the counter. We paid, and were seated at our table within 20 minutes of entering the line. 

2 Buffets came to $82 on a Saturday during Thanksgiving weekend.

Pros:
Sign me up for a buffet with a small line, and I will be there every time (+1)
Almost all the stations had delicious food (+1)
- Salad station
- 2 Carving stations.
   - Ham & Turkey
   - Prime Rib & Leg of Lamb
- Breakfast 
   - Cereal, etc.
   - Southern
- Italian station. Freshly made pasta, pizza etc.
- Noodles, Rice etc.
- Snow crab as well as King crab legs sliced in half.
- Sushi Bar (Only station with not a wide variety) (-1)
- An entire island with Desserts. Including Gluten free kind. They also had Flan (+1)
Service was very prompt. Our empty plates were being removed as soon as we set them aside. Our fruit drinks were refilled without even asking for it (+1)

Cons:
Blind spot between the ice cream area and the breakfast bagel\/bread area. A lady dropped her desserts because someone bumped into her from behind. It might be a structural post?

Overall we got our bang for the buck, as well as an opportunity to try out several different cuisines at the same time. This is what buffet's are for, right? :-)

However, this particular buffet was surprisingly good, especially the breakfast\/brunch selection. My favorite dish was the made-to-order omelette. I was mostly impressed by the overall freshness of all the food. None of it tasted like it had been sitting out for hours and the variety of food offered was dizzying. At $16 per person for the breakfast\/brunch, I thought this buffet was a bargain for a Vegas Strip eatery.

The trick about catching this buffet is that you get there late enough to enjoy the brunch foods, but stay long enough to enjoy the dinner foods too.

For example, my dining companion had her eyes peeled for the crab legs.  When they finally arrived at the very end of our long long meal, she made room in her stomach for the crab.  The poke and sashimi stuff started coming out later on too, and I gorged on that as well.  (It's not exactly the highest quality, but it'll do.)

Overall, buffets are what you make of them.  You overeat and you overeat more.  The good thing about this buffet is the huge selection of food and you're bound to find at least a few things you like.  Everyone in your party is bound to be happy, and that's the good thing.  

The question always remains though, did I eat my money's worth?  And sometimes you do, and sometimes you don't.  I try not to do the buffet thing anymore.  I don't think I'm getting my money's worth.  I think I rather pay more for quality than quantity.

Update: 04\/24\/07 - Last Friday I tried doing the Bellagio buffet again.  This time we went at 3:30, just in time to pay the lunch price ($19.95) but see the dinner goodies come out at 4 pm.  Dinner goodies include king crab legs, prime rib, kobe beef, etc.  Other honorable mentions include rack of lamb, creme brulee, caramel flan, chocolate-covered strawberries, shrimp cocktail, ceviche, and poke. 

Sadly, I'm an embarrassment when it comes down to buffets.  I know that I definitely didn't get my money's worth at all.  We stayed there for at least two hours and I could even eat twenty dollars worth!  I'll have to say no the next time I'm invited!",1,2,2

To be fair, people come here for the king crab legs, and people were waiting on line, piling their plates. 

Shrimp cocktail and Alaskan crab legs -- seafood highlights that people flocked to 

Fruit station - cantaloupe, honey dew, and watermelon 

Ice cream -- the chocolate one wasn't working well, and came out super slow. Was also watery and melted quickly. 

Soups - chicken noodle was the highlight, but they had other ones 

Breakfast - turkey and pork sausages, eggs (but the powdered kind, not the fresh ones), French toast that lacked any seasoning or flavor, small waffle rounds (regular and Red Velvet). Bacon that was cooked well enough that most of it was crispy. Nothing worse than spongey bacon that has fat yet to be rendered off
Small bagels, but only butter and mini jams, no cream cheese. Or I couldn't find it. 

Japanese - Sushi, but it was made with ridiculous amounts of rice. Like 60% of the roll was all rice. By the time I picked out the actual imitation crab meat\/veggies, it was so insignificant. 

Chinese - can't imagine buffets cooking Chinese food well, so steered clear of this. I may be a little biased from NYC Chinatown, so take my words with a grain of salt. 

Salad bar - Romaine, spinach, and some kind of spring mix blend. Romaine looked the freshest, so got a plate of that piled with shredded carrots, onion, big juicy grape tomatoes. Wasn't a big salad bar and not a lot of veggie options to go with it, but was still refreshing enough. Had the typical dressings : Balsamic, Ranch, Cesar, Blue Cheese. 

Italian - had plenty of pasta dishes, but was too full to try any! Mostly red sauces, I think. 

Desserts - were adorable, but they always are. Little cakes, tiny mason jars of pudding or creams, macarons (although the tray went fast and they didn't replace it!), macaroons, an assortment of cookies, and so much more! 
Baskets of bananas and apples-- take some to go! 

Linger long enough after a late lunch and you can get first dibs on the dinner items. 
Tables were spaced apart appropriately. It's hard to enjoy dining if someone is always squeezing their way in and knocking your arms\/elbows. 

Staff was so friendly. Our waiter came by so many times with our waters and orange juices. Was nice and pleasant each and every time. He seemed relaxed, as if he was working leisurely, but still managed to attend to everyone. 

Also, Annabelle was super helpful : my sister and her family had been seated, but I was running a little late. I waited in line, but then asked if I could skip ahead to pay and join my family. Once I proved that my family was actually inside (my sister had to go and show her the table with her husband and baby! Lol, maybe people are desperate enough to lie and jump the line??), she helped me go pay and saved me at least 30-45 minutes! Really appreciated that, as she didn't have to say yes.",6,0,0

I went this past Father's Day for the gourmet dinner. To me it seems no different than any other dinner I have had there other than the price was higher. The service was good but not great.

I come here for the King Crab legs and seafood for the most part. I have to say that the quality of the crab was down from previous visits. Half of each batch was very small and some of it soggy. More the size of even smaller snow crab legs. It was a bit under whelming as I expected the larger higher quality I had had every other time. The sushi, poke and rolls were good but not great. There were several made to order rolls featuring 3 types of fish roe. These were very good. The other several seafood selections were good as well. The selection was again a bit more limited than in the past. The prime rib and lamb chops were very good as were the veggie selections. 

My wife and daughter had the cold shrimp which they enjoyed. They concentrated more on the non-seafood items like the several offerings at the carving table and various hot sides such as mac and cheese, mashed potatos, veggies and other like creations. They said it was all good but nothing particularly great. At this point I was so full I did not try the desert but they tried several small samples none of which were anything off the hook notable. 

All in all I would try this place one more time and hope it was better before I give up on it. Understand that the crab is my main criteria for judging this place. Others may see this differently.",4,0,0

We have to go to the Bellagio Buffet!!! WE HAVE TO GO TO THE BELLAGIO BUFFET!!!!!""

Waited in line for like 2 hours on a Sunday and was not pleased at all with the end result. Maybe because we were at the Wynn's buffet the night before and were totally blown away by it. We had such high expectations for Bellagio's buffet since we read such good reviews about it and thought that if the Wynn was awesome, the Bellagio would be buffet heaven.

The food was unremarkable and I don't even remember what I ate besides the prime rib and crab legs. I know I tasted something of everything but really, I don't remember anything that I ate. That's what made it so bad. Oh, I also had a glass of green tea.

The decor reminded me of a Sizzler. I know, it's a buffet so don't expect chandeliers or famous paintings on the wall but it just didn't look like it would belong in the Bellagio. Maybe in a hotel like Harrah's across the street?

@ Alaskan King Crab - Being the Asian that I am, I did load up on this. If we're talking about getting our moneys worth, this is probably the quickest way to achieve this. I did see people piling up the King Crab like crazy, present company included. Since there is actually two King Crab stations, one on each side of the buffet, they don't get refill as fast as the Wynn, so there may be a lot of scrappy pieces no one really wants. These aren't as big or as sweet as the Wynn. 

@ Snow Crab - You have King Crab, there is no reason to get this!  But for comparison sake, these weren't as sweet as the King Crab and you get smaller crabs.

@ Kobe Beef - A buffet serving Kobe beef, that grabbed my attention. Sadly, it did in all the wrong way. This was dry and flavorless and I question whether or not it really was Kobe beef. I took maybe 2 bites and just passed on the rest. There goes that Kobe beef.

@ Sushi - I'm not sure if you can even call this sushi. I'm sure I can find better sushi at a gas station. Everything from the tuna nigri to the salmon nigri to the California roll to the shrimp tempura was just disgusting. For comparison sake, the Wynn is just as bad. Studio B was good though.

@ Halibut - Overcooked fish is ever so good.

@ Prime Rib - The staple meat at all buffets. This was dryer than an August day in Vegas.

@ Crusted Lamb - This wasn't all that bad. It was at least cooked right and tasty. My only criticism for this was I didn't want any of the crusting around the lamb. It just takes away from the flavors of the lamb.

@ Bread - This is a sin at a buffet, but since everything wasn't as good I got some bread. It surpringsly was good and fresh. Something is wrong when I come to a buffet and the bread is one of the high points of this place.

@ Apple Pie - It didn't even taste like apples and the crust was very mushy. Mc Donald's apple pie taste better and I hate McDonalds! 

@ Coconut Cake - One of the highlights of the dinner. It was just good. 

The wait was surpringsly short, maybe 30 minutes on a Saturday night before Mothers Day. I was a little suspicious of the line being so short. Each person was charged $40, instead of the usual $36 since it was a holiday weekend. I was dissapointed to see my grandma get charge full price as well. 

Our waiter just wasn't very good either. We would ask for drinks and he would bring out our drinks 20 minutes later. The same issues with clearing our plates. It was a holiday weekend, but it wasn't really even that busy. We eventually had to ask the managers to bring us our drinks. Just horrible service. 

Dollar for dollar, the Bellagio and Wynn buffet cost the same. The Bellagio has more variety, but the Wynn seems to have much higher quality items. I prefer having better quality stuff, than a variety of medicore food. 

Bellagio was highly dissapointing for me in both food and service, considering its regarded as one of the Top 3 buffets in Vegas (other 2 being Studio B and Wynn). I'll stick to the Wynn or Studio B for my buffets for now. Good thing I won at the blackjack table, so the bill wasn't too painful!",3,4,2

Salads, pasta, carving stations, food of various ethnicities and cuisines await you before the selection of soft serve ice cream and mini desserts call your name.

3. Service: It's a buffet, so expectations are low; the server we had did a good job in making sure our beverages were always full.

I like the service.
Beautiful location.
Cons:
Food isn't outstanding for the price.
I felt that the food choices were redundant.
I got sick from the food.

It was wise of the head of my party to make a reservation at the Buffet at Bellagio. If we hadn't, we probably would've waited for 4 hours, and that is no exaggeration. Even WITH a reservation, we had an hour long wait before we were actually seated. It's a good thing I had someone with me or else I would've completely forgot that the reason I had gone to the Bellagio in the first place was to eat at the buffet...cause I would've wandered off and left without eating. Don't judge, I have a short attention span.

We sit down and are served our drinks (drinks aren't self-serviced). Finally, we get to go eat.
I got:
Beef sirloin steak
-4\/5. It was really tough for being Med-rare. I liked the flavor, though.
Sushi
-1\/5. Tasted like the sushi you get at Savemart or something. Eww.
Rice
-5\/5. It's rice....
Sopas (beef)
-2\/5. Tasted off and soggy.
Shrimp
-5\/5. Plump and juicy.
Cheese Pizza
3.67568\/5. It tasted alright. Got tired of it after awhile.
Creme Brulee
56709568409684\/5. OH MY GOSH AMAZING
every single other dessert that I can't name:
1\/5. Ew.

For a buffet, it didn't really have a HUGE selection of food (SHOCKER!). I was disappointed. 
That, and the food quality averaged at about 3\/5. 

The food also made me really sick! This is coming from the person who took 2 laxatives once (don't ask) and didn't feel any pain, who eats popcorn with habanero sauce, who drinks Pepsi at 2 AM, you get the picture. Basically, I'm a goat.

I had everything from Chilean seabass, tuna & salmon Poke, prime rib, king crab legs, truffle scented ravioli, tempura sushi, sweet potato mash, pesto potato mash, mussels, scallop salad, roasted salmon, fingerling potatoes, asparagus, and more and more.

The dessert selection was a bit disappointed. We did a tasting of mini cheesecake, creme puff, napolean, hazelnut chocolate cake, creme brulee, carrot cake, and some apricot thing with chocolate.

First things first, the buffet is ideally located on the strip inside the Bellagio hotel. The hotel has a rather large parking structure that allows you to park without too many difficulties. You should note that the parking structure will become paid very soon though.

My main issue with this buffet is the price. This is easily one of the most expensive buffets in Las Vegas, and as such, you would expect to get absolutely top-quality food. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The food is good but nothing exceptional for the price, thus leading to a low quality\/price ratio.

Service is pretty good, but alcohol is not included in the price so be ready to spend even more if you want to include that in your meal.

Overall, I would not recommend this buffet since many others are just as good as well as much cheaper. Stay away from tourist traps! Feel free to message me should you need any additional information.",3,1,3

onto my BRIEF SUMMARY!
- Buffets are usually about quantity not quality, but Bellagio gives you great quality food & a whole lot of it
- Smaller than Rio but better quality
- Great service
- Wasted food goes to Pig Farm
- Quality Deserts

Every time I go to Vegas, I've officially been there 3 times in the last 6 months, I've got to hit the Bellagio Buffet. Bottom line. Yes, you should go to Rio because it's the world's biggest buffet, but when you're done poo-ing your brains out, you'll want to spend an additional 5 bucks and go to Bellagio.

VEGAS = LINES. So if you're gonna cry about waiting in line for the club or a really great restaurant, then don't go to Vegas. It's like going to an amusement park during some busy holiday weekend and crying about how you have to wait in line for a ride. It's RIDICULOUS. Suck it up and wait.. the longer you wait, the MORE food you'll probbaly eat. HAHA

So we waited like 10-15 minutes in line to eat dinner on Friday Night around 7 or 8pm. Normal wait time in Vegas without reservations can be at least an hour. it is a little bit pricey but again, it's worth it. Yeah it's 34.99 and basically you pay $40\/a person.

In general the Bellagio is a NICE Casino and the buffet has nice decor. As soon as we sat down we were greeted and put our drink orders in. and then headed towards the buffet!

If you haven't been to the Bellagio Buffet yet, make sure you go around ONCE and look at everything they have to offer. The stuff on the right side isn't always the same as the stuff on the left side, so you wanna plan out what all you want to eat lol. The thing about Bellagio is that unless you're absolutely stuck on something in particular, you could probably eat a whole bunch of different meals in one setting haha.

My first stop is always the salad bar. They have freshly prepared salads to choose from and then they have the built-it-yourself. I love that their field greens are always fresh as well all of the other ingredients. They've got plenty of salad dressings and toppings. 

On to the stuff that everyone wants, but rarely matters to me. Seafood! There's so much food in general, that I basically ignore all the crab legs and other seafood. There is sushi available and it looks ok. I think I had it back in December and it wasn't anything to brag about. 

Bellagio seems to specialize in giving you different ""gourmet"" type foods. I especially loved the Kobe Beef Top Sirloin, Beef Wellington, Roasted Turkey and the Ostrich. Although, I've never ate Ostrich, I thought it was cool that they had it! They also had roasted Quail. Didn't try it but hey if you're adventurous, do you!

Bellagio also has all of the staple foods that regular buffets have. Super creamy and fluffy mashed potatoes (& a pesto version), fresh artisan bread, Asian cuisine, pastas, and carved meats.

Deserts is where I think Bellagio sets itself from the Rio. Rio has a lot of selection, as does Bellagio. But Bellagio's cheesecake is legitimate. I think it's plain cheesecake with a fruit topping is equivalent to cheesecake factory. The cheesecake itself is very rich and smooth. And they have other deserts as well. I ate a few different things, but usually you're too full to even eat desert, depending on who you are.

All in all, Bellagio to me is the best buffet in Las Vegas. I prefer it over any other buffet that I've been to and the service is great. They constantly filled up my drink, took away my dishes and offered advice on food. I'm sure there's people that may disagree with me, but ehh they're not as cool as me! haha.

Go to Bellagio and eat the buffet. Don't waste your money on a cheap buffet that's gonna keep you on the toilet. Get quality & quantity here!",1,5,1

I've been to a few buffets at Las Vegas and THE BUFFET at the Bellagio is simply the best.  

There's nothing really wrong with the other places except that they are all the same.  You get served the same food at every other place.  There's nothing to distinguish it from the rest of the strip.  Typically, you'll get a ton of fried food fillers, poor prime rib, some shrimp cocktail and a few other fillers.  Nothing to ever write home about.  You'll be full at the other places. 

At THE BUFFET, you get a great variety and the food is much higher quality.  Start with the Japanese section and you'll find yourself eating good sushi and sashimi along with an assortment of rolls.  There's also some really good salmon or ahi tuna poke.  

In the hot food line, you can find veal, sea bass!, prime rib, bison, and a lot more.  The options here are unique in itself.  That's what drives me to come here if I'm in Vegas.  There's no other buffet that I'm willing to go to because I've already been spoiled by the Buffet.

1) For $38 for their weekend gourmet dinner, you get an immense selection of relatively high quality food. Go to a very ordinary non-buffet restaurant on The Strip and Vegas and $38 gets you a very mediocre steak and maybe an appetizer. At the Bellagio, you get an unlimited amount of relatively expensive foods like prime rib, Chilean sea bass, Kobe beef, sushi, Peking duck, etc.

2) The selection is more plentiful and higher quality than at Wynn and The Wicked Spoon. Sure, if you like a smaller selection of lower quality food *but* in small, expensive containers that's made in France, go to The Wicked Spoon.

You have to circle it like a vulture and pounce as soon as they put it out.

3) Closes early - We were seated around 9:00pm and they started to get ready to close around 10pm, we did not have desserts and fruits...  There were many people in line behind us and I wonder if they were even able to have anything other than appetizers\/ salads.

I know our experiences were probably mainly due to the Thanksgiving Holiday, but for the price, I believe they should be able to keep the usual service and food quality...

I will not be back.

The Christmas and Thanksgiving buffets are particularly noteworthy...I love to try a variety of fish and poultry, random side dishes, and of course lots of sushi.  There is a large assortment of desserts, but really, with food so good, I never have room for dessert.  One negative to the buffet is the long line that forms- sometimes 3-4 hours long... We've never waited in a line (if you gamble for a certain period of time, you can get line passes that allow you to go to the head of the line- or really, to go into a short line that forms next to the long line) but I suppose I would say the buffet is worth the wait (though its even more worth it without the wait :))",0,0,0

My friends and I went to Vegas last month and went to the Bellagio for dinner. There was a vast variety of foods. There were crab legs, prime rib, asian section, pasta section, etc. Most of which (I would say all, but I did not get to try everything) were really good. Since I have a sweet tooth, if I ever go to a buffet, I usually spend more time in the dessert section than anywhere else. They had so many choices in desserts! And let me tell you, the CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRIES, are effin' incredible. Their covered in like dark chocolate with mini rice balls sprinkled on top. I think they are the number one reason that I love Vegas. The service was awesome, our waiter kept refilling our drinks, each time we returned to the table it was cleared. 

Since I did not write a review last month about it because I honestly suck as a yelper, I lag on reviews and I'm just plain lazy. So now, my updated review will be here as well. That being said, we went to Vegas again, last weekend!  This time we went to the Wynn for dinner (totally NOT better than the Bellagio, people who have said it was is on crack). Being kinda disappointed by the Wynn, we went to the Bellagio for Sunday brunch. Again, Bellagio did not disappoint at all. There was so much food to choose from. They had this herb-crusted prime rib that was soooooo good. It was so tender and juicy. Omg. Their pancakes with so fluffy  it just melted in my mouth.  I made my own version of strawberries stuffed french toast by getting strawberries form the fruit section and placing them in between two slices of freshly made french toast, drizzle some syrup, and dusted some powder sugar. Heaven. Heaven. Heaven. or Hell. Whichever you prefer as the better destination to be. They had no chocolate covered strawberries for their brunch. Sucks. And service this time kinda sucked, our waitress would not refill our drinks unless she was flagged down, and even then she would forget some of ours, and we had to flag her again to remind her. And it would be kinda annoying because I would be too awkward and shy to ask again (since it would happen to be my drinks that she would forget, like my orange juice refills and tea). Our tables would not be cleared, in fact some other waiter helped us clear it a couple of times. But then our waitress was limping, so I felt kinda bad and let her slide,  and still tipped her pretty good, even though my friends are pretty correct that if you're paying that much you should expect service comparable to that.

Oh yeah, ice cream was chocolate and vanilla, soft serve. :( disappointing, but not enough to knock off a star.

The Kobe beef was just marginal and not what I expected.  Prime rib was alright.  The sushi bar didn't have a large variety, just very minimal.  There was caviar - three types.  Really could have done without this, but at least we wanted to try this.

However, my husband and I really did love the coconut macaroons here and they were about the best we've tasted.  There were a large selection of desserts and I felt more than the options for things at the buffet.

I did really like the broccolini, but to pay this much for greens?  My husband and some of the family tasted the few Asian dishes and they said it wasn't that great.  

My husband and I did like the pork tenderloin and that was very tender.  There were some Thanksgiving type food and maybe cooking for a buffet diminished the taste of the food.  I don't know.  A bit disappointing. 

There was also a taco bar and some Latino type foods, but they didn't look appealing.  Salad bar was also marginal.  Sweet Tomatoes has them way outdone here.

Guess I was thinking of Bellagio as a grand hotel, I would expect a grand buffet.  But, I think my expectations were too high.  I would expect that it would be better than a $15-20 buffet, but I was wrong.

Very generous of my mom to foot the bill for her 4 of her children and our families.  $$$$$.

I would like to add, the server waiting on our half of the table, Lorde (sp?), was top notch.  He was excellent and I give him a 10 star out of 5 stars.  He cleared our plates regularly, filled our drinks regularly, was humorous, but polite.  Very professional and he worked hard the 2 hours we were there - not only on our table but the other tables he was responsible for.  Great job by him.  I didn't pay attention to the other end of the table of our party of 16, though.

Some of my family did get a lot of crab, but I'm too lazy to crack the shells to get the meat, so I rarely ever eat crab.  It did seem like they had this stocked well.

It's not a bad buffet, but for the price, I would have expected a much better selection and variety of foods than was presented.",2,1,0

Went during weekday lunch for 22.99\/person and was very pleased. Although the selection was poor in certain aspects (for sushi there were only california rolls and one spicy tuna roll), I was very happy with the overall quality consistency of choices. The heavier meat cuts including the St Louis pork ribs, brisket, and flank steak were all very solid. Even the Asian foods (from the perspective of this Asian) were very tasty. Interestingly, many breakfast foods were still available well into lunch hours, including an omelette station if that's your thing. Finally, it looks like they put out the full desserts repertoire for lunch, which includes awesome sugar-free options that are just as tasty as their guiltier counterparts.

i actually wanted to try another buffet but our friends wanted to come here...and it was okay with me as long as it was bellagio.

but i didn't know that they hike up the price for no reason easter weekend.  it was $44.95!!  OMG..  as if they don't already make enough money..  boo.

the line wasn't too bad but it still took about 40 minutes.  (i got in line at 7:15pm)

what i always eat at any buffet is the prime rib.  people who know me know that i LOVE my prime rib.  after i enter the buffet, i go straight to the carver and get two helpings.  before other people have come back from going through the entire buffet, i'm already done with that.  heheh..

luckily, the prime rib was medium rare when i arrived.  the latter pieces were overcooked.  by the time they got more fresh meat, i was on dessert. 

the creamy horseradish is across from the meat station.  however, the real horseradish was located in a weird location inbetween the pasta and pizza.  yeah, i didn't get it.. 

kobe sirloin was tough and overdone.  they had quite a bit of lamb if you like it but i don't. 

i liked the mixed corn, mushrooms, etc in the salad bar area.  the fish was okay...seabass and swordfish.

alaskan crab legs were okay too.  you can request that they steam the crab legs in hot water so that you can have it warm.

worst thing was the pork.  they don't know how to cook pork at all.  how do you mess up baby back ribs?  they must be talented.  pork belly was tough too.  it's supposed to melt in your mouth not be like a rock.

service was okay.  they bring out drinks and clear plates.  

desserts were delicious.  they had bread pudding, peach panecotta, napoleon, raspberry chocolate mousse cake, big french macaroons, soft serve vanilla, brownies, apple pie, etc.. 

i think the quality of the food has deteriorated.  the desserts are still good.  that's about it.  i wish i tried the other buffet i was thinking of...  if i knew we were going to pay $45 per person, i would have pushed for it.  oh well..

the $44.95 price tag was too much...even for a buffet.  oh yeah, there is no kids' price.  i asked cuz i was curious since i saw some people bring a good number of kids.  kids are full price unless they are under 3 years old.  but maybe they are high rollers and get free buffet coupons.  still vegas is not a great place to take kids...

The buffet is one of the simpler looking buffets compared to the other buffets of it's caliber in the area. It's also the cheaper option for the quality of food you get (imo), w\/ lunch priced at $22 and dinner at around $37 (both + tax) on the weekdays. And heads up this is a review of their weekday menu, not their weekend (which I understand comes with more items and a higher price).

The service is good. The variety is standard. That is, they have salad, sushi, cold bar, prime rib, chicken, turkey, a semblance of chinese food, pizza, pasta, seafood, dessert, etc. If you're looking for something totally out there and exotic your'e not going to find it at this buffet (and I don't why you'd look at buffets for that type of stuff anyways). If you want more variety buffets such as the Bacchanal at Caesars will be for you. However, the reason why they're my favorite buffet is because of the food. 

The Good: 
1.) The prime rib here is the best between Bacchanal, Wynn, and Bellagio. They're smaller, but from what I've seen and eaten the prime rib is better seasoned and cooked better than the other buffets. 
2.) Lamb lollipops. The first 2 batches were really good with the proper medium rare available, but alas as time went on they overcooked it consistently.
3.) The sea bass, which was tender and had decent flavor. 
4.) Smoked salmon is offered both lunch and dinner
5.) There were split King Crab legs on a weekday dinner. Score!

The Whatever\/Bad:
Sushi was whatever to bad (per-the-usual) Turkey was going on dry, but okay, the rotisserie chicken was decent, and dessert was also decent, but mostly whatever. I mostly avoid the Chinese line (at all the buffets there) and you need to check to make sure the piece of fish you are grabbing is overcooked or not. My method, poke it with the tongs. If it flakes easily than take it, if it is solid, its overcooked.

In short, the Bellagio may not have the most varied, exotic selection, or the prettiest decor, but they make food that I want to eat and do enough of it well that I'd want to come back. That and the price is pretty affordable to cheap if you're looking for a good upscale buffet to eat at.",6,0,1

The Buffet at Bellagio has soooo fallen off it's allure and pedestal of being one of the top, high-end buffets in Vegas of years ago. The first sign was that we (party of 2) only had to wait 15 minutes.

Their carving station meats were not plentiful and selective. Meats did not taste all that good. Ribs were dry. Steaks were dry. Turkey tasted like cardboard.

Turkey gravy was super salty. 

One of the carvers took his sweet @ss time slicing every single piece of prime rib and turkey. Makes for an even longer wait! arghhh!

The layout is horrible. 

Not much main dish selection. 

Food was very tasteless.

Everything seemed so ""bulk cafeteria"" made.

They close at 1030, but at 9pm, the dessert station was ""all out of chocolate covered strawberries"". So lame.

Desserts did not taste good. The cheesecake was so bad. Didn't even have any chocolate cake selections!

A sign of a buffet that is not high-end? When the ice cream station is NOT manned by a human being. More of a sign that a buffet is actually low-end? When the ice cream station is a crappy soft-serve, manual, help-yourself dispenser! This is a severe contrast to the manned, well-decorated, well-presented gelato stations at the Rio Carnival, the Aria Buffet, the Bacchanal, etc.

To top things off, it was a ""holiday weekend"", so they charged ""holiday prices"". $47.99+tax pp. Yet, the selection, the quality, and the experience was barely better than that of cross of Hometown Buffet and Souplantation!

Holy Mother Of  BLEEP!

Listen, all you ""regular"" healthy people have no clue what this means to someone who is Diabetic (Hypoglycemic). I have been FORCED to give up sweets for the past year and have been living in HELL. lol

Alright, let me rewind....

My Fiance & I were told that The Buffet At Bellagio is the BEST in Las Vegas. So we head down for Dinner and wait in the Massive Line (1 Hour). 

I was very happy to see the fresh and amazing selection of hot and cold food at the buffet. I was also impressed with the Sushi and Chinese section. Very tasty, satisfying and CLEAN! Out of all the Buffet's I have tried, Bellagio's was by far the best.

So...after I finish my 5th plate of food that SAD time of night arrives. ""Dessert Time"". A time of night that I NEVER get to be apart of because of my medical condition. Lame Lame Lame...

I decided to tease myself by strolling around their Dessert Buffet Selection to see what I could have been eating if I didn't have this sucky lame condition. As I come around the last corner of desserts before my eyes there was a BRIGHT LIGHT...

Is this GOD?

JESUS??!

No.....even better.

SUGAR FREE DESSERTS !! BLEEPIN' BLEEP!

They had Cheesecake and Apple Crumb Pie!

Shrimp cocktail was awesome as well as some of the other seafood selections, but a lot of meat dishes were overcooked, dry, and tough. Good pasta and pizza, but I try to limit my carb consumption at buffets so that I can eat more and get my $$ worth. 

Now on to desserts. My friends and I tried little bit of everything, there was really no wow factor. Everything was a bit bland, even flan and tiramisu. Come'on, how can you ever go wrong with flan and tiramisu? The best ones were chocolate eclair and bread pudding, but not good enough to go get seconds. 

Considering that I came here after not eating for good ~20 hours, I should have enjoyed the food more than usual but unfortunately, that was not the case.

Just got back from Vegas (again). I have to say...Bellagio ""you complete me"" OK so I was starving when I arrived in Vegas - only having eaten breakfast and snacking on some dangerous Trader Joe's Snowpeas. 

My friends and I decided to go grab dinner around 5ish to beat the crowd. And I'm glad we did. 

I started off with some pasta - beef ravioli and some tortellinis made with some walnut pesto sauce. YUMMMMY! Then I got some of the still bleeding kobe beef - roast or prime? same? I had some lamb chops (a bit dry), some king crabs (already sliced in half, PERFECTO), shrimp, sushi (Cali rolls), seaweed salad, etc. etc. 

Because it was Chinese New Year weekend, there were quite a few Asian dishes. The only Asian thing I ate was the spiked fruit (Lychee? or Rambutan?)

In terms of dessert - SO MANY to choose from. Luckily almost all were bite size. Makes me feel less guilty. 

Of the other Vegas Buffets I have been to: Wicked Spoon (at Cosmo) and Studio B Buffet (at M Resort) ... Bellagio is my favorite.

I've been to most of the buffets in Vegas, and Bellagio is definitely one of the pricier ones, but also the best. It's also one of the only buffets to have their champagne brunch on Saturday as well as Sunday.

First and foremost - they are not stingy with the champagne here, so if you're coming with a big group and you get here early, you DEFINITELY get your money's worth.

Second, the food is pretty much classic buffet food (if you're looking for fine cuisine, don't look in the buffet), but the overall quality and selection of the food is better than most other Vegas buffets.  Their prime rib station is key (and actually good), the desert station is great, and the salad section is well stocked and fresh.

Haven't tried all the buffets, but enough to know that Bellagio has the best one in that town.  Maybe not the best for the price, but there's no sense in traveling that far and paying hard-earned money to get a mediocre meal.   The food is good and everyone is sure to find something to satisfy them. 

Last time I went, earlier this year, I found Tuna Poke during dinner.  Yummy!  Just imagine, all you can eat.  But, I've learned from past experience to pace myself.   Eat a little, rest, go back for more, rest, etc.  And, you need to save room for desserts, such as the caramel flan.  They even have sugarfree creations available.  It's mind boggling how many  dessert items there are to select from.  Oh, and I asked for green tea at the end of my meal, and it was from Maeda-en and had Matcha (powdered green tea) in the tea bag, not one from Bigelow or the like.  I thought this was a nice touch.  For those who have never been to a buffet like this, after they seat you, take a walk to examine all the offerings.  Then, take small portions of what you want.  After that you can go back for seconds, thirds, fourths, etc. of what you really enjoyed.  They constantly replenish.  I'm pretty sure you can sit there for as long as you like.  Just don't go too late at night, when the selections begin to dwindle, and you get to view the workers begin to dump platter after platter of perfectly good food in the trash, as they begin to close down for the evening.  And as one of the other reviewers noted, if you want a little of everything, go in a time slot right before lunch, so you can have breakfast AND lunch items to choose from.   For dinner, you'll find anything from smoked salmon,  crab legs, salad greens with scallops and pine nuts, prime rib, wild boar, sauteed Chinese vegetables, pizza, shrimp cocktail, to a selection of soups.  You might have to hover around the dessert station, because as they bring out something like chocolate dipped strawberries, hungry diners will swoop down and swipe them all before you know it.  

Be prepared, there can be long lines.  Unless you know someone who's a high-roller and gets comped, then you get to zip by in the express line.  =)

I pigged out on the king crab legs, which I think is the most expensive food available at the buffet. They had both cocktail sauce and melted butter available, which made everything taste so much better. Unfortunately, the crab legs were salted (probably on purpose to make people more full) so I couldn't eat too many. 

Other than the crab legs, all the other food items were just okay. I tried all the meats but nothing was extraordinary. My family all enjoyed the lamb, however, so give that a try. There was also a poke section that wasn't too bad. The salmon and tuna were pre-seasoned and cut into small cubes so you could make your own little poke salad\/bowl.  

My only other favorite was their bread pudding. There were two different types (one regular one chocolate maybe?) but I preferred the regular one, as the darker colored one had too much cinnamon. I definitely recommend putting some vanilla soft serve on top of the bread pudding as it'll make it taste even better. 

Overall, okay food but I would never wait that long for this buffet ever again. I did, however, go during Christmas weekend when Vegas was super packed so during regular days, the line probably isn't that long.

I liked the cheese\/deli meat selections as it included prosciutto, cured salami, and tasty cheeses.  This sums up the things I liked.  I took a star away because they have gone downhill a bit.

Service usually isn't great at buffets but we had excellent service here. Waited about 1 hour and 20 minutes in line before we got seated on a Wednesday night. 

Crab legs gaLORE! Although I found it strange how some of the crab legs were left whole and some were cut in half. Unfortunately there were a mixture of good legs and bad legs...but the majority of them were good and sweet. My fellow cheap Asians are always crowding around the crab legs. It's a little irritating when one person holds up the line by standing there for several minutes being picky about her legs. 

Prime rib was so on point I got 2 servings. The pizza was surprisingly really good...I'm ashamed to say I ate 3 slices when I could have saved room for other things. Bellagio Buffet has a much wider selection of pastas compared to other buffets I have been to. I really enjoyed all the pastas on top of my 3 slices of pizza. I definitely carb loaded here. 

The Chinese section was mediocre. Very average dumplings...and I would pass on the wonton soup. Japanese\/sushi section had much higher quality raw fish than Bacchanal! I was very pleased with the hand rolls, ahi poke, and salmon poke.

As pathetic as this sounds, the mussels and clams at the Bellagio were far worse than the ones I can find at a $10.99 Chinese buffet in Houston. Mussels were tiny and flavorless. Likewise, the clams had been overcooked, were hard and had no flavor. The best cut of beef served at the Bellagio was flank steak. Let me repeat that again -- flank steak. It does not exude ""fancy"" as the Bellagio should. Even the buffet at the Wynn (which isn't great) served prime rib. The chicken sausage at the Bellagio was flavorless. The pork sausage was too salty as was the Tuscan sausage soup. The Wynn has a very good gelato (with a dozen or so different flavors). In contrast, the Bellagio has a soft serve machine.

So we had the champagne brunch this morning.  Actually my husband didn't have champagne- so his price was $25, if you want champagne it's $5 extra.  

I read reviews here yesterday before deciding to fork out $60 for brunch.  The only conclusion I can come to at this point is that most of the reviews must be tourists.  I'm a local, and this buffet is NOT ""the best buffet ever"".  I'm used to buffets, so walking in and seeing tons of food doesn't shock me.   My husband would have preferred Golden Corral over this, not me though.

The main reason we came here was because my parents had comps and we wanted to have breakfast with them.  So we didn't have to wait in the nice long line.

As for the food, it was decent.  The selection wasn't that great- at first it looks great, until you realize there are a lot of duplicates- like bacon in 4 different areas, sausage if 4 different areas, whole roasted potatoes in 3 different area....ya get it?  I also don't think the layout of the food flows nicely either.  It's all chopped up so it's very easy to miss things.  

I'm a pretty plain eater so I had things like bacon, french toast, roasted potatoes, pizza, a nice salad, prime rib,  mashed potatoes and some dessert.  Everything was good, but again, $30 worth....I don't think so.

Oh and their desserts look great, but they were all room temperature.  I don't know about ya'll, but I like my cheesecake to be cold!!  Oh, and no ice-cream.  What the hell, the buffet at Sunset Station that costs $10 has real ice-cream.  Not that soft serve ice milk crap!!  

I see that other reviews mention crab legs- there were not any when we were there.

The service was good, just good.  I wouldn't say it was anyting spectacular, it was as expected.  Our plates where cleared in a timely manner and our drinks where always pretty full.  I was kinda annoyed though when I told the waitress that I wanted a mimosa.  She basically just dumped some OJ in my champagne glass that was 3\/4 full.  So after she added the OJ it was full to the brim.  And maybe it's just me, but pulp free OJ would be nice in a mimosa.

I highly doubt we will be returning to this buffet.  I think the husband and I will try The Wicked Spoon.   And if we don't like that we'll stick to The M.  

I'd much rather go to The M, where beer and wine are included with your price.  The M has a seafood dinner buffet on the weekends for the same price as this brunch, and it's their original dinner buffet PLUS seafood, so it'll work for those who don't like seafood.

Most of the meat in the carving stations were incredibly dry. The ostrich meat had a great taste to it but all the other meats we tried (kobe top sirloin, pork short ribs) were just dry. 

Asian food here should not be touched, the sushi rolls and nigris were incredibly gross, they resembled the sushi you'd get in supermarket packages. Fried rice tasted very americanized. 

Waitress was very nice and service was overall excelllent. Everytime I came back to the table, my plates were cleared and my drink refilled.

As I tasted a number of the foods I experienced a common theme: blandness. The sliders didn't have great flavor (or any at all). The lo mein was generic. The fried rice had no flavor. The flank steak was nothing like what I've experienced at Brazilian steakhouses around the country. 

When it came time for dessert the choices were more than sufficient. The mousse had good texture and great presentation. The mini donuts were a palatable treat. The ""Disappointing Dessert"" award goes to the bread pudding. Although the flavor was right and texture was on par, as it sat on my plate it looked like old scrambled eggs. 

Chances are that you haven't read this far, but props to you if you have. 

Bite the bullet, get out there, and eat at the Bellagio Buffet just to say you've done it. It far surpasses the 'ole GC (That's Golden Corral for you buffet n00bz) but it's no 5-star restaurant.",4,3,2

Here is what we thought after waiting 2.5 hours in the crazy line. When were were at the front we were told it was a 4-5 hour wait in the regular line. 
 
Seafood. Crab legs. Ehhh. Only served chilled along with shrimp. Not bad but not great either. Chilled seafood. 3. Hot seafood included salmon and cod.  Salmon was decent. 3

Meats. Had rack of lamb, quail, prime rib, and a few others. Those that I ate, they were good. Quail was nicely seared and tasted good. 3.5 stars for meats

Desserts. Desserts had the typical selection of small cheesecakes, bread pudding, flan, ice cream. I had the flan which was good without that burnt taste but hAd a slight lemon flavor to make it mild. Nice texture. 4 stars. Bread pudding was good as well. 4. Only had a chocolate eclair when I was hoping for a vanilla eclair.  Did not try all but overall were decent, nothing spectacular. 3

Pastas and flatbread pizzas. There were a few choices of pasta dishes. I had a rigatoni with a cream sauce with other ingredients I forgot. All looked unique. The one I had was decent.  3. The flatbread pizzas were delicious. 3.5 overall

Service.  Only after being one of the fools to wait in ""guest"" line until we got to the front, did we wonder why there was a second line for invited guests and platinum or noir mlife members. Oh, by the way, if you pay $20 more per person you bypass the cattle line and go to the shorter line.  Are you kidding me?  Uncool to to not tell it at the beginning of the cattle line. The ratio seemed to move at about 2 to 1 in the pay extra line to guest line. Way uncool. -2

Overall. I am not a buffet person but the food was okay. Would I do it again to wait in that line? No f'ing way. We were super peeved at the way they squeeze more money out of people by randomly choosing people of the $20 per person extra line. That made the cattle line that much slower. Add multiple expletives here.

Never again.  Sorry it was okay but nothing spectacular.  That line wait to find out about the other line just ruined the experience overall.  3 without the line wait. -1 for that line.",1,0,1

My game plan: 
1. Fill up on light loads (ahi tuna, and the weird shrimp salad was surprisingly good) 
2. Go for the heavy hitters (Filet Mignon, prime rib, lamp chops were yummy, venison was... eh... stringy? I thought Bambi would be more tender... that purple sauce didn't help either... and smoked salmon) 
3. Finally the ""you'll never get full off of this"" grand finale... crab legs. Well... eventually (two hours later) that theory was proven to be... quite false.

After three plates of main course, it was time for what I aptly dubbed ""Operation Dessert Storm."" Of course we were all feeling it by now, but dammit, we made a pact to taste every dessert in here. So... between me and two of my friends, we grabbed one of each dessert from the bar and split each one three ways. By the end, all was left was about 3 giant piles of little plates and cups and a couple of lemon flavored stuff that nobody wanted. I guess the general consensus was that lemon flavor = too sour for this type of mass indigestion. Needless to say the waitress was thoroughly surprised that two guys and a girl can cause this amount of destruction. We left her a nice tip for carrying all those dishes and for putting up with us for three hours.

In conclusion, the (over)abundance of fresh seafood, different types of delectable meat, and the endless variety of desserts... Bellagio, I think... I love you.",1,2,1

1. This buffet is located in the center of the gaming floor in the Bellagio casino.

2. The line appears to move much more quickly than that of other buffets. So don't fret about a long line! Realistically it's a pretty short wait when compared to Bacchanal.

3. On the little island area next to the bar, there are several made to order dishes. You must ask a person to make you what is behind the counter! Don't hesitate to ask.

One thing about this buffet, that seems to have happened to my girlfriend and me was the fact that every time we went it felt like we were getting diminishing returns on our enjoyment of this place.

First off, I must say that if Yelp were to allow us to rate their level of service and the food, I would almost give it five stars. There have been some problems when we pay for our buffet from pretty shoddy and downright awful service. What I mean by this is, on a few occasions, the people who were taking our money were absolutely impolite. One time, we tried to charge our room at a different MGM resort. However, the lady taking the money was not having it since the system was not really working properly. She angrily told us to pay with a credit card or with cash or get out. 

Anyways, besides service problems at intake, the servers and bussers in the buffet area are always top notch. I have never had to complain about a server. They are incredibly efficient and thoughtful with your needs.

The second thing, that results in such a low rating then is that the food just isn't as good as it is every time we go. Like I said about diminishing returns, it seems that every time we go to the buffet the food gets worse and worse and more and more unappetizing. For example, we LOVED their prime rib. We couldn't stop raving about how awesome it was all the way home and to our friends. However, after our last few trips, we were so disappointed by the quality and dryness of the meat.

As for the desserts, it feels like the Bellagio is caught in some sort of timewarp. They are still trapped in the early 2000s where soft-serve ice cream is the norm for most buffets. I don't know why they haven't updated to gelato or at least scoopable ice cream.

Anyways, the Bellagio Buffet is still an iconic part of the Vegas strip! You should still try it out to see if you like it. Happy eating! :)",0,0,0

Seafood:  The crab legs were so scrawny.  Mussels were pretty good.  Fish was... okay.  

Sushi:  I really don't like eating lots of sushi at buffets unless it's more of the expensive stuff, like ikura, but they only had salmon poke and generic cheaper stuff.

Pastas:  Only one pasta that was non-dairy.  And it had meat.  They had a sweet potato ravioli... and I am pretty sure it had cheese\/dairy in it... but they chef said it didn't.  My bf tasted it before I ate it... and yes it did have dairy in it.  Thanks for almost making me sick chef.

Make your own seafood crepe bar:  Pretty good concept, BUT.  Again with the creme-sauces... all with dairy or cheese.  Again, the chef said no cheese, but after my bf tasted it... said I shouldn't risk it.  Double bad on the chefs.

Made a 2nd seafood crepe... without sauce this time.  and you should have only used 1\/4 of the butter you used to cook it.  Seriously.  I felt like throwing up after eating a bite.  I couldn't eat after that.  Made me a little sick.  =(  Triple bad on chefs.

Desserts:  Pretty good.  Had a Creme Brulee.  You could taste the burning.  

So my take is:  If you're vegetarian or lactose intolerant... or both... then this is not a great buffet for the price.  My bf eats meat and he said the same.  Nothing special.  Not even a good buffet for the price.  Last trip I ate at the M Resort buffet and the Wynn buffet.  Go there instead and save your stomachs and money.",2,1,0

My friends and I went for Sunday brunch, and there wasn't much of a line when we went. The price was about $30 something dollars plus tax.

The selection of food wasn't all that great or delicious. I felt the prime rib pieces were a bit small, and the crab legs were only ""cracked"" and not split in half, though my friend said they were split in half for dinner.

Most of the other food felt like standard fair buffet food, feeling very uninspired compared to other higher end buffets. Of the items I tried, they didn't taste all that good, causing me to end up eating more prime rib because nothing else was all that appetizing.

The dessert was also not all that great (they didn't have creme brulee either :(), and most of it tasted rather boring and kind of all the same, in the sense that it just tasted like sweet food without any character.

Definitely a pass for me in the future, since there are so many other buffets in the Vegas strip area.",9,1,0

They was an empty bowl when we arrived the last time, but guess who was waiting at the number 1 spot?  Yeah!  The crab meat was huge like I last remembered.  Hot butter?  Bib?  

They have a huge variety of food types, like:  Italian, Japanese, Chinese, seafood and American cuisines.  We always have a little of everything and it is delicious.  I've never had sushi at a buffet, is it safe here?  Anyone?  My friend said yes!  Shhhhhh. I never tried it.  I only get sushi at my favorite Japanese places.  

Here are some tips:

1) For dinner, go early meaning before 6pm or expect a long line.  There has always been a line when we have gone. If the line zig-zags to the the casino - that's 1 hour. 

In January, they had a $15 VIP service which would allow us to cut to the front.  We had a show and we had a lot a food to eat so we decided it was worth it.  That trimmed 60+ minutes for us.  

2) Don't over eat, save room for dessert.

I love food and I tend to not have very good self control so I steer clear from places like that. You know the kid in the candy store expression? Sadly that's me when I see food. Here is an example: I can eat pizza 24\/7 if it is standing in front of me. I can tolerate the pain it gives me. So I was a bit nervous as there was so much potential for my ass to grow. But I figured when in it Rome, screw it and stuff your face, you are on vacation. Well I am ashamed to say that in 4 days, I went to 3 buffets. See? Zero self control. 

This buffet was suggested by trip advisor as top 5 buffets on the strip. It was second following Caesar's and third was the Wynn one. 

We went in and was told that the wait time was going to be bad. It wasn't all that awful. If you are like me and love people watching (and occasionally judging) then there was plenty of things to see and watch while waiting in line. We anticipated 1 hr and we were in within 30 mins. 

You sit down and the servers come and get your drink order. Then u go and pick your food and thats where all your troubles begin. HOLLY CHOICES! There were 5 kinds of salmon, cooked in all sorts of ways. Calamari salads, pasta, pizza, veggies, mussels, shrimp, beef, chicken, ribs, sushi, chinese food, breakfast food, all types of bread, a whole section with fruit and another one with desserts. There wasnt anything that I tried that I didnt like. I went absolutely crazy on seafood and fruit that I couldnt even make it to the pizza section. I was beyond stuffed. Therefore I became the healthiest eater in buffet history. Only fish and fruit. Hey I am ok with that.

Of course there's sushi too but there were bowls of self-serve salmon or tuna poke as well- I haven't seen that before. Crab legs were a big draw as well as other unusual items like their ceviche and fish stew. The desserts are impressive with their own big section and are displayed impressively in mini, delicate servings.

BUT IS IT WORTH THE PRICE, LINE, AND TIME?
Oh no. No no no. First, the entrance line was at least 100 people deep for a weeknight dinner. Thankfully we reserved spaces ahead of time and skipped that line. Then, at $50\/head it's much cheaper to enjoy a better tasting\/ better quality meal off the strip (and that's including Uber).

HOW WAS THE FOOD ITSELF?
I had a few bites of almost every offering there. It was difficult to enjoy the crab legs (obviously the main draw) since each leg was cut lengthwise resulting in thin, scraggly meat.

There was salmon and tuna poke and nigiri. The salmon once again was great, but the tuna not really. There was a smoked salmon bite type thing that was delicious. I did not care for the creamed spinach here at all. So in general they do salmon very well everything else is a hit or miss. They also do dessert very well.

Once inside, it seemed the quality of the crab legs had gone down a bit. They were on the small side and not as meaty as previously. I tried the king crab and snow crab legs, and both were tasty. The lamb, mushrooms, and cauliflower gratin? escalloped? were absolutely delicious. The seared salmon, Mac n cheese, and scalloped potatoes were bland, and the beef Wellington was dried out. The sliced cheese was dried out and the fresh cantaloupe not very sweet.Of the desserts, the bread pudding and tiramisu were the best.

Even so, I would have given it 4 stars based on the items I really liked. However, my bf doesn't eat seafood or red meat, and he pretty much didn't enjoy anything that he tried. He said most of it was bland, overcooked, or it just didn't taste very good. The best thing was the orange juice, which was sweet and delicious. We definitely didn't get our $38 worth out of his meal.

The only other buffet I've been to in Vegas is the one at the Rio and I would rate both the food and the service at the Bellagio significantly higher.  I know the Wynn buffet is supposed to be awesome as well, but I haven't experience that one yet.

Wait:  We got there a little after 11:30 am and were seated by 12:45.  If you get there earlier, the wait would probably be shorter.

Price: We paid $30 for the brunch buffet, plus $5 for unlimited champagne.  That sounds pricey at first glance, but in my opinion it was totally worth it for the quality of the food and the quantity we ended up eating.  Also, $5 for unlimited champagne in Vegas is as good of a deal as you're going to get.

Service:  Very impressive for a buffet.  Water, coffee, and champagne were refilled promptly.  Our server did forget my friend's coffee request towards the end of the meal, but she eventually remembered and that was the only small issue.  I was pleasantly surprised with how attentive our server was.

Food:  Very good for a buffet.  My friend and I came prepared and attacked the buffet with a plan.  We broke it down into breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert courses.  We were there for about 3 hours.  In retrospect this was pretty disgusting, but whatever.  I'm going to try to remember what I ate...
Breakfast round:
- Eggs benedict: Awesome.  The egg was perfectly cooked, and the hollandaise sauce was the perfect balance of buttery and lemon-y.
- Bagel and lox: Always a good choice for brunch.  Their bagels weren't the freshest of bagels, but they were good.  The smoked salmon was lovely, and there were all the fixing you could ever want: tomatoes, red onion, capers, cream cheese.
- Breakfast sausage:  A little dry, but tasty.

Lunch round:
- Chicken biryani: Very good.  Awesome flavor, although it could have been spicier.  Chicken was very tender.
- Spicy tuna cones:  Delicious!  A must-try.  Kind of a deconstructed spicy tuna roll, with tuna, rice, cucumber, etc, wrapped in a sushi wrap, but in a cone instead of a roll (resulting in much more tuna fitting in a single serving).  So so good.

Dinner round:
- Lamb: Very flavorful and tender.  And they had an interesting mint jelly sauce that I loved, although I don't remember what was in it.
- Spicy Thai beef:  I remember it being spicy, but that's really all I remember.

Dessert round:
- Bread pudding:  Incredible.  I may be biased because I love bread pudding and I haven't had it in so long, but this bread pudding was awesome.  Creamy texture, light flavor.
- Mini Key Lime Tartes:  Also very good, although not the best key lime I've had.
- Mini Chocolate Mousse Cakes:  Awesome. Super chocolately with a nice fluffy texture.

I know I'm forgetting a significant amount of the food I tried, but these are the things that stuck out in my mind.

Highly recommend!",0,0,0

I SPENT HOURS LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT BUFFET FOR MY ONE NICE BUFFET IN VEGAS.  WE HAVE A WINNER!!!

I have tried all the ones that are priced over 35 bucks.  I am not sure when i will be back in vegas and i only had one shot to get this right.

THEY HAVE SNOW CRAB AND KING CRAB.  THEY HAVE PRIME RIB, TURKEY, RACK OF LAMB, KOBE TENDERLOIN and some other various meats that didn't catch my eyes.

This place is HUGE.  This place on saturday night at 6:30 is PACKED.  Plan accordingly.  The line wrapped along outside the casino passed the bathroom.  I asked an attendant how long is the wait.  He said an hour.  I then found one of the coolest things ever.  If you are less than a party of 4 and over 21, they will seat you immeadiatly at the bar.  When we were done (90 minutes later) people who were in front of us in the massive line were still far away from getting in.

I only used caps in this review because a good buffet is judged by its crab legs and carving station.  

I did do something new at a buffet. ,  one of my plates consisted of new food i have never tried. I cant remember what they were but i was impressed.

Here are my biggest issues with the experience at the Buffet at Bellagio:
1. Being the weekend, this was supposed to be a brunch buffet and it is true that there were many breakfast-y items. However, in general, it was very hard to construct a meaningful meal out of the items that were there. For example, there was fried rice and chow mein but no (Chinese) entrees that one could have with those. For my brother-in-law, who's a big lover of meat, he had nothing that satisfied his appetite. For myself, a big lover of seafood, again there was nothing that I would really fancy, such as lobster or scallops or crabs or sushi. There were supposed to be at least 3 types of sushi (based on the place cards we saw) but the sushi had mostly run out and were never replenished.
2. The stations were very poorly laid out and as a result, the placement of the items made very little sense. I do not recollect another buffet experience where the layout was worse than here. For example, they had french toast in one section but maple syrup was nowhere to be found next to it. Eventually after asking a staff member I was able to locate it. I was far from the only one having this problem as a little girl asked me about where the maple syrup was once I had managed to drizzle it on my french toast. Likewise, there were sorbets and icecreams but they were very far from each other. Toppings for the sorbets and icecreams were also in different sections even though most people might want to have access to a broad assortment of toppings.
3. Lastly, I found the service to be quite unfriendly. We had a server (Claudia, I think) and I don't think she (or any other waitstaff that we encountered) smiled even once during the entire 2-hours or so that we were there. Food items were also not regularly replenished and when I inquired about the sushi which had run out, the staff did not appear apologetic about that and expressed no interest in replenishing the items. A final illustration of the lack of helpfulness of their staff was that as we were standing in line to get in, we inquired about wait times. One of their staff members commented that we would have a 45-minute wait and we were getting ready to leave on hearing of such a long wait time. However, in the end, we did stand in line and the wait turned out to be no more than 20 minutes. A shorter wait time was certainly appreciated but then again, we would have left the restaurant on the basis of the incorrect information provided by this staff member

Overall, I would say this was a deeply unsatisfying and unfulfilling experience and certainly when considered against the $30 price we paid for it, this was a complete bust. in my view, they served very mediocre food that was laid out in the most haphazard manner imaginable and it was combined with unfriendly and unwelcoming service. I would definitely not go back to this buffet again especially when there are so many options to choose from in Las Vegas.",4,2,2

I suggest making a lap around first and devising a game an as to what you want most. Then categorize your plates by cuisine, avoiding mixing Italian with Chinese.  As much as I tried to downsize my portions, I didn't have enough space for everything.  I'm sad I didn't get a chance to try the prime rib, rack of lamb, and breakfast.

Environment:
The buffet is located through the casino (of course) and right near the guest elevators. You have to wait in (a longggg) line and then they shuttle you off to a table. Like any other buffet, you sit down, order drinks, and move towards the plates. Yet, on this special day, as I sat down, I immediately felt sticky goo on my legs. Why would I feel this, you ask? Oh, only because there was SYRUP ALL OVER MY CHAIR! When I stood up, my dress was sticking to the chair and my legs were covered in goo. Disgusting. The waiter\/bus boy simply handed me a wet towel (am I supposed to wipe down the chair myself?) and told me he would send over a manager. I peeled myself off the chair, of course the syrup all over my dress, and had to go back to my room and change. LUCKILY, I was staying at the Bellagio. What if I hadn't been staying there? Would I have to take a taxi with syrup all over me? After changing and coming back to the buffet, thirty minutes had already passed, and I had tickets to a show in less than an hour. Therefore, my $40 dinner was clearly not going to be worth it for me; who spends less than an hour at a buffet?? Did they refund me my dinner? No. They just offered to dry clean my dress.

Food:
The food is OKAY. The prime rib was juicy and tender, but they were stingy with the end cuts, the horseradish was not very spicy, and their au jus was too salty. The turkey was dry and only good because of their cranberry sauce that I poured over the meat (their cranberry sauce is good but could use more cloves\/orange peel). The pesto mashed potatoes were my favorite, but I realized I was just filling up on carbs and had to save room for bigger and better things. The crab legs had lemon already squeezed on them - don't they realize not everyone likes lemon on their crab? The crab did not taste that fresh to me...a bit too fishy and not like the sea. Perhaps the lemon was to hide the non-freshness...? I tried their pesto chicken pasta and it was WAY too salty! I couldn't have more than one bite. The sweet potato puree had too much orange juice\/flavoring or whatever they add. The sushi was definitely NOT fresh and probably only deserves one or two stars (please compare to A'Float Sushi). The salmon sushi was dry (how can raw fish be dry? how long was it sitting there?) and tasted like old sushi. Same goes for the albacore sushi. The only good thing from their raw fish\/""Asian"" section was the salmon poke not because the salmon quality was good (although it was better than the sushi's) but because the sauce was good. The dessert was the best part because they have a nice selection of sweet treats. The key lime was good, but the carrot cake was disappointing (too dry!).

Why three stars?
Overall, the food at the Bellagio buffet is decent: the prime rib deserves five stars but their sushi only deserves one star. The service was crappy, but I feel like that is the overall experience at the Bellagio (the guest service wasn't that great at the Bellagio, but that's another review).",0,0,0

ok? ok. 

i'm a buffet person by nature, unfortunately. i like quantity. quantity of choices, quantity of shit piled on my plate. buffet at bellagio fulfilled those prerequisites and topped it all off with a hefty portion of quality.

lobster ravioli, sushi, crab legs, carbonara, soups, breads, salads, sandwiches...all beautifully presented and very, very tasty for mass-produced food. the drink servers are wonderful - speedy and friendly.

i'm a freak in the sense that vegas is probably my favorite american city, and the new emphasis on ""foodie"" food and stellar service are the top two reasons why. the buffet at bellagio is a perfect example of how to do a vegas buffet the right way.",1,2,1

I was actually shocked and I hope I did not catch them just on a ""bad night."" But the nice looking prime rib, mashed potatoes and gravy were just cold and lame by the time I sat down. I will say they had a FAST LANE for the MLife holders and that was AWESOME!!

But NO WAY would I wait in line ever at Bellagio for their Buffet or go there even if its FREE!!! The Aria is the best buffet second only to the Wynn, and Mirage I felt was third best and totally the most gracious staff ever at the Mirage Buffet, Every service person thanked us for our business and went out of their way to smile and do so. This was not the case at the Bellagio and if they could just make their food HOT HOT it would be quite awesome.

It was the only real problem I saw they have and perhaps just a bad night so I apologize if this was the case. ALL the staff depend on tourism and good reviews. So I am careful with what I say and give that real thought.

 the pesto mashed potatoes
Kobe beef- but its difficult to cut with the butter knife you're provided with, as others have said
The caramelized onions, on absolutely anything or by themselves
Tuna and salmon sashimi with the seaweed salad
Creamed spinach (definitely a surprise) 
potato soup- it's like delicious velvet!
Chocolate dome dessert

The only cuisine I did not see represented here was middle eastern\/persian- how hard would it be to put out some pita bread and hummus, kalamata olives, and maybe some kabobs or a schwarma dish? I'd love to see what they could do with that type of food.

I saw foods mentioned in other reviews that I did not find during my visit, such as caviar and chilean sea bass, that I would be interested in trying.

Service

Jeder Bereich hatte seinen über eifrigen oder unaufmerksamen Kellner für Getränke. Das geht auf jedenfalls besser oder dezenter. Dreckiges Geschirr würde zügig abgeräumt.

First of all, I love the clean look of the place.. nothing fancy or spectacular but being what it is and where it is located, you just feel like this is no ordinary buffet.

The buffet lines is wavy designed starting from the right side to the left side of the facility.

I usually skipped the first section and go toward the hot food sections instead... (I'm not a big fan of cheese\/bread and I feel that having salads at buffets really is not worth the price I'm paying and defeats the purpose -- especially in Bellagio)  So I just cut to the chase...

Rack of lamb:  Juicious maximus!  Love the tenderness of their rack of lamb!  But sometimes the chefs can be stingy and only gives out 2 pcs or so... I'd usually have someone help me get a couple more so I wouldn't have to make the additional trip.

Prime rib:  What do you expect?  It was cooked perfectly and juicy as well!  If you want it bloody, they got it.  If you want it well done, it's available for you as well.. anyway you like it it's pretty much available to you just have to tell it to the chef.  (they will try to accomodate as much as possible)  

Beef Wellington:  Delicious beef wrapped in bread... did I mention ""buttery"" bread?  Oh yeah.... it was buttery alright....YUMMY!

What's this?  Many variations of fresh made pizzas?  Not the basic kinds that you would find at the lower end buffets.. all the great stuff that is up to the caliber of CPK and other fine pizza establishments!  I had a veggie pizza and it was wonderful!  (But didn't want to fill my stomach up with useless carbs.. keep moving forward please...)

Same goes for pasta dishes.. looked absolutely wonderful.... but has to pass due to the carb regulations... no can't do sir!  Only sampled here and their and it was wonderful!

Asian food:  I'm asian... usually not too excited about getting asian food at buffets unless it's like Makino's or Midori's  (pls refer to my other reviews) So took a few bok choys just to fill some void in the veggies column... that's all...

Seafood... ok.. took almost everything here because of it's cost and it's taste.. all seafood were great as there were many to choose from... but most memorable was the sea bass... SUPER BUTTERY like you are eating butter straight up!!  (I wonder if that was actually butter carved into looking like sea bass?  Regardless... melt in your mouth like a chocolate yet it's fish!  Go figure!)  This is a must and hopefully they offer it when you are visiting this place....  (sometimes they leave it off the menu for some reason.....(sad days)

Sushi:  Not a great selection as it's not known for that but it's got some basic selections, but their tuna ahi poke sashimi was super jammin!  Chunky pieces of ahi marinated in vinegary soy sauce with seseme... awesome sashimi!

Soup:  Cream of corn was heavenly.... It's like drinking liquid gold! 

Finally, the dessert!  Way too many selections to choose from!  Bellagio buffet also have one of the largest sugar-free sections so it's definitely a plus!  Everything is good here!  No additonal explanation necessary!  (Just try them all!)

Lastly, service was impeccable.... what do you expect?  It's Bellagio!  Drinks were always topped, servers has always been wonderful and courteous, and the staff overall was great!  (we took a long time there and they never once ever rushed us out even though there is a long wait outside for seating!  And they asked us if we wanted coffee!  Awesome!

I can't say enough good thing about this place... it's an experience you must have for yourself....I never had a bad time here and hopefully you will get to enjoy what I've always enjoyed here.. a perfect ending to a long day in vegas.....

I'm Bellagio biased..... and will always be!",31,17,28

This place has fresh tuna, moist prime rib, desserts with more depth and character, better ice tea, better french sour dough, and a better salad selection.  By short contrast, the Wynn had no tuna, pathetic desserts that tasted oily rather than rich, dry prime rib, nasty rasberry flavored ice tea, and horrible service.

Don't waste your money anywhere else.  If you're going to binge on food to plump yourself up, be nice to yourself and eat here instead.  

One negative was the crab.  They started slicing the crab legs in half and as a result, they've become freezer burned with an iodine aftertaste.  Now the legs are dry and salty.  Why fuck up a good thing?  It's the same at the Wynn.

I find the prime kind of rare but the taste was pretty good. There were a few items on the hot entree that was pretty delicious while a few I tried one bite and I left it there. Overall the buffet isn't bad so its not bad to try it out if you're in bellagio.",1,0,0

The food was pretty good. Not outstanding cuisine, but, again, far better than anything else you'd get for the price in a restaurant. A three-course meal for under $20 is a bargain.

They have a really good range of choice - curry, roast, salad, sushi, pizza, plus a bit dessert selection. 

You have to queue and then serve yourself - but that's what I expect from a buffet.

Some of the past favorites that include Beef Tartare which was extremely flavorful, Chicken Wellington cooked to perfection, and Bellagio makes the best Miso soup that I have ever had in my life.  It is so light airy but packs a mean flavor profile its salty, sweet and earthy all at the same time.  Desserts, Bellagio always has a nice variety of desserts to me.  My hubby tried the flan and loved the undertones pineapple throughout it, not overly sweet and baked to perfection.  I had a chocolate dome white a dark chocolate drop on the top and a white chocolate candy.  The chocolate dome is for chocolate lovers only, it is dark chocolate and extremely rich.  As you eat it you can taste different chocolates, dark, semi-sweet, possibly milk chocolate, it works though.  Their cheesecake is always so good, creamy, sweet and this time it had a raspberry reduction in it (made with real fruit).

First off, the wait can be ridiculous at times and believe me I'm sure we all waited in that crazy line once in our lifetime, but it's totally worth the wait.

The seafood selection is what mostly catches my attention. I'd say half of my meal there consisted of shrimp cocktail, massive crab legs, smoked salmon, poke, and baked salmon. There's also other goodies there as well such as an assortment of pasta, poultry, salads, soups, and of course my favorite part of a meal; dessert!

The dessert is off the hook and everytime I come here, I can't help stop but to stare and drool at all the yummy delicacies. Also, I love how they have sugar-free versions of the majority of the desserts for those of use that feel extremely guilty after all the gunk we ate from our main meal.

What I love about this buffet is that they have smoked salmon, and plenty of it, even during breakfast! The smoked salmon is so rich and so smooth, very very good. The eggs benedict is also another of my favorites here. They make breakfast perfectly with all their wide selections of food.

Dinner here is also pretty good, but I would have to say dinner at the Wynn buffet definitely beats this one out. The prime rib is not as tender here as at the Wynn and the other selections are not as good. Don't get me wrong though it is still a top notch buffet for dinner, just not the best Vegas can offer.

The service here is really nice, the waiters actually make conversation with you if wanted, for example telling some interesting stories, etc. They also come and ask if you need a refill instantly when they see that you are near empty.

LOCATION
=========

It's in the Bellagio. Pretty big dining room, the actual buffet stations seem smaller than others (RIO \/ WYNN). However it's done pretty nice \/ elegantly. Main problem was in the mens bathroom there was ONLY one toilet. Really? At a buffet?? TIP: go to the bathroom JUST OUTSIDE the entrance... it's huge, 8 toilets cause, well... if you eat like me.....

==============

http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=h0ab-sdiexycfQL4AnHptg&userid=1pgT-Eeh-GIOlhOgHMMRZA

~ FLANK STEAK - This was the best thing here. Juicy, tender, flavorful deliciousness. (5\/5)

~ BACON - It's awesome bacon, 'nuff said. (5\/5)

~ BEEF RAVIOLI w\/MUSHROOM CREAM SAUCE - Absolutely delicious. The sauce, the ravioli... tasted strikingly similar to Stroganoff. (5\/5)

~ CHICKEN & SUNDRIED TOMATOES w\/BASIL VINAIGRETTE -  It was heavenly. A nice medley of flavors. (5\/5)

~ TURKEY SLIDERS - More of a 4.5 but still really good. Make sure you add the lettuce, onions and condiments, but yeah the slice of turkey breast is delicious. (5\/5)


~ BEEF SLIDERS - They were pretty good. Not BACHANNAL level like @ Ceasars but really good nontheless. (4\/5)

~ SPARE RIBS - These were really good. Chef cuts them per request. (4\/5)

~ SMOKED TROUT - Tasted pretty good. It was very similar to LOX. Salty tastiness. (4\/5)

~ PESTO MASHED POTATOES - They were green pesto riddled mashed potatoes. Never hear \/ seen em before... ingenious idea. Tasty without butter or gravy. (4\/5)

~ SPICY TUNA HANDROLL - It was really good. Surprisingly so. (4\/5)

~ CA ROLL - Pretty solid. It's really a four but it's hard to rate ANY basic CA Roll that high. (3\/5)

~ CALAMARI & TOMATO SHALLOTS - Looked appealing... looks can deceive. Wasn't that great. (2\/5)

~ SHRIMP & PESTO PIZZA - This was horrible. Nothing and I mean NOTHING redeeming about it.

DESSERTS
-----------------

~ CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES - They were okay. (3\/5)

~ WHITE CHIP MACADAMIA NUT COOKIES - Subpar. (2\/5)

~ FUDGE BROWNIE - Nothing special. (2\/5)

~ CHEESECAKE - Below average. Not that sweet. (2\/5)

~ NAPOLEON - It was horrible. Tasteless. (1\/5)

FINAL THOUGHTS
===============

So all in all it's a pretty good buffet. There were no crab legs for lunch... the desserts I sampled were terrible. However MOST of the food was above average and pretty good. Lunch selection was pretty small compared to BACHANNAL and WYNN buffets but it is what it is. A pretty good deal for $19.99.",2,2,2

My aunt really wanted to visit this buffet because it had been highly recommended by a friend of hers. We arrived at buffet at around 8p.m. and there was quite a line to get in. We were told that it was going to be at least an hour wait. We joined the line and settled in for the wait. 
Long story short, an hour and 15 minutes later, after dealing with a woman behind us who kept complaining about how hungry she was and how long it was taking for us to get in, large groups of people coming into the Invited guest line which ended with us having to wait at the beginning of our line for an additional 15 minutes, and then having to wait to be seated once we had paid, we were finally seated.
Because it was already after 9 and the buffet closed at 10, I was concerned that there wasn't going to be very much of a selection of food. The selection wasn't bad, but unless you're a seafood fan or like Italian, there really wasn't much of a selection. Many of the other dishes looked picked over and only had maybe a serving or two left. I had been hearing good things about the desserts but when I finally made it through the crowd to there, it looked like there was virtually nothing. The few different desserts that were still there had a lot of each of them, but there were maybe 5 or 6 different choices. 
I understand that we had gone late and they were going to be closing in less than an hour, but I was a little disappointed. The food was good, but I had expected more from the selection. 
The highlight of our visit, and the reason that I ended up going up half a star and rating it a 4 instead of a 3 was our server Julie. She brought our drinks quickly and refilled without us having to ask. She also cleared the empty dishes and brought us new utensils quickly and efficiently. We had excellent service from her and it was much appreciated after a long day. 

I'm not sure I'll be back any time soon. If I do, it would have to be earlier in the day because I don't know if the dinner buffet is worth the $33+ and the wait in line. It was an okay buffet, though, and if you're in the area, have the time and the money to spend, then I'd say go for it. Just don't go after 8p.m.",2,0,0

There's a long wait to get in - no reservations for a buffet - but it is worth it.  Once you get in, there's a fabulous selection of food and many tables.

They bump the pricing when it's holidays or during peak seasons.  I've been here for breakfast for $21 on a Sunday and they were asking $40 during the holidays. 

I've been here for lunch and had different foods for the first time like shark.  They serve American, sushi, Japanese, Italian and Chinese dishes.  They serve mimosas for brunch at an extra charge so tell them if you want the bubbly or not when there in the morning.  The dessert options aren't that great.

They offer unlimited drinks now for $12.99 and that includes alcohol.

The food is clearly made fresh and throughout the day.  There isn't a line to get your food, per se, as there are various stations to walk up to.  Some have chefs to serve you and others are self-serve.  The staff that clear your plates and provide beverages are fast and not always   friendly but they are polite.

The atmosphere is good.  The restaurant has the buffet look and feel obviously from the way the tables are set up and there's a lot of beige but you don't mind as much due to the good food.

Try it out during a Friday or Saturday night for dinner, when the best food is served in my opinion.  They whip out several types of caviar, sushi, Ahi tuna and other food you don't see at a typical buffet.

Make sure to check ahead of time to make sure they're serving beef wellington because it's not on the menu every day. The place itself does not look very big, but the waiters and servers are very nice. Fridays and Saturdays are the Gourmet Dinner days, but it's best to go in for the lunch meal and stay for dinner because the price difference is HUGE. Think of it as linner (lunch + dinner).

There's always a line for the king crab legs. They're already cracked open for you - very easy to eat. (I don't know if they have the buttery topping like at Wynn though) The cocktail shrimp is also really good. Prime rib was on the bloody side last time I went, and the rotisserie chicken was dry, but as usual, the beef wellington does NOT fail. It's perfectly cooked - very tender. Avoid the variety of fishes near the Chinese food though, because these are usually dry. The sushi is on the plain side too. 

The dessert selection is very varied and looks fancy. My favorite is the one in a small glass cup with multiple layers. There's a light brown layer under a beige layer that tastes like coffee and chocolate, and it's covered with whipped cream. I forget the name of it, but it's delicious! Avoid the raspberry with cream and chocolate bites on top though - it tastes really sour! The creme brulee and chocolate-covered strawberries look simple, but they're really good!

Note: Apparently, you're not allowed to take photos of the food. I attempted to take a photo at the dessert station because they just looked SO delicious and artistic, and I love taking photos of food, but the chef behind the counter told me no photos. Maybe they're afraid I can somehow figure out all their secret recipes from simply looking at my photos. *shrug*

To start, they mentioned it was going to be 32.99 and come to the place and it was 42 per person (not the end of the world) let's continue.  There were roughly 5 parties of people in front of us. Few families and couples.  We stood there (didn't move in line) for not a joke, 50 minutes. Right in front of us in line were tables, two of which were vacant and dirty from the previous parties for roughly 25 minutes before someone said something. ALSO, there was about 9-10 groups of people who left while we waited in line.  Again, some things are worth the wait, let's get to the food.  The food was very disappointing.  Some food looked old, the pizza alone looked like dominoes. The crap legs were very stringy and cold. I don't know about you but I enjoy them freshly hot and steamed AND with butter, which when I asked about the butter, I was told ""yea guess we don't have any.""

desserts were so so.... nothing to talk about

The service that I experienced was very good and fast paced. However, the line for the dinner buffet was quite lengthy, so my suggestion is get there before 7:30! The prices are not too bad, considering the wide variety of foods to choose from. That evening, the food was extremely salty and I think the chef could have done a much better job with the meats. My favorite part was definitely the sea food and the desserts.

 I would recommend going here for breakfast or brunch. Their breakfast\/brunch buffet has AMAZING pancakes and french toast that I ate with the jam they offered. For lunch, the selection is pretty much the same as the one they had for dinner. Same meats, salads, pastas and desserts. If you go there for brunch, you can still get a late breakfast in and then start right away with lunch.

The salad bar was minimal, and the buffet was overloaded with meat. I know that most people will think that this is where you get your moneys-worth, but even so I love a great big salad at the begging of my meal. It was really shitty small, with two kinds of leafy greens, a couple of cheeses and two or three dressings. Really? 

The meat. Beef wellington--yuck. Lamb--tasted fishy (?). Turkey--dry. Seafood--only idiots eat seafood at a buffet. 

The dessert was the best part, and I really loaded up on these. Much to my chagrin, desserts combined with 10 free Heinekens= projectile vomiting. Not sure if I can blame that on the Bellagio, but I'd say that they have to take come credit for it.

Anyway, try the crab legs and shrimp cocktail (better than Bacchanal), the duck breast, grilled duck legs, and of course, the goose.  They had great grilled lamb chops, prime rib and sushi.  Selection is not as vast as Bacchanal, but it is a lot cheaper and we found that my son likes the chicken mole sauce.

The lamb chop was a bit better. Best parts were some of the random sides, like some scalloped potato thing, creamed spinach, etc. The desserts were spot on though, I ate six different ones, all delicious.

You will rarely find me in a buffet line as I don't frequent or really like buffets. I prefer excellent, single-size portioned meals over mediocre, all-you-can-eat buffet food that has been coughed & sneezed on\/manhandled by the unwashed masses. But occasionally, I'll put my buffet hangups aside & risk it for an exceptionally good breakfast\/brunch buffet, and Vegas is thee place to buffet. 

The Buffet at Bellagio is located in The Bellagio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV & is walking distance (next door) to The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino where I stayed. I only tried the breakfast\/brunch buffet (not dinner) at The Bellagio which costs around $40 for the price of admission to breakfast\/brunch bonanza! (Gemtastic deal considering market price for 1 piece of whole, Greek Sea Bass was $150 at Milos in The Cosmo, which is equal to almost 4 trips to the bottomless Buffet at Bellagio!)

Sweet baby Jesus, there is every kind of protein, carb & type of cuisine under the hot, Vegas sun that one could possibly dream about having for breakfast & brunch at this buffet. It has an abundance of fresh fruit & veggies (raw, steamed, grilled, etc.); sliced cheeses; nuts; yogurts; sushi; rice; decadent desserts & pastries; a meat carving station; an omelette station; assortment of cereals; bacon; sausage; ribs; kobe beef; chicken & eggs every way; pizza; a plethora of salads, seafood & pasta; and a variety of muffins, rolls, bagels, waffles, toast, pancakes, & any other variation of bread you can possibly imagine. Needless to say there's something here for everyone at Bellagio, so go ahead & buffet your lil brains away! 

I sampled a lil of everything here & it was all super fresh & gemlicious! Some of my gemmy faves at The Buffet included the blackened salmon; the thin-crust Mediterranean pizza; the gluten-free, chocolate-chip muffins & the soft-serve sorbet machine was pretty friggin' sweet! Oh yeah, can't forget my numero uno fave aka unlimited, Alaskan King crab legs! 5+ gems for selection, variety, quality & taste of buffet food!

Also, I was very impressed by the cleanliness\/maintenance of the Bellagio Buffet. The food was constantly being refilled & refreshed, and there was always a worker around wiping, cleaning & maintaining the food stations & buffet area. You could eat off the floors here. It was spotless! A+ for food sanitation & a squeaky clean buffet! 

The service at Bellagio was excellent too. My table was promptly cleared plate after plate & my server was ""Johnny on the Spot"" with the coffee refills! 5 gems for speed & efficiency & keeping my coffee mug full at all times! A caffeinated Gem is a happy Gem! 

Sure there are newer, more cosmo\/hip buffets than The Buffet at Bellagio, but if you wake up a starvin' marvin' then I highly recommend goin' to this classic buffet for breakfast\/brunch. It's still servin' up hella good food & lots of it, no little, wicked bites allowed here! For $40 you can eat yourself into a stupor like a high roller & who doesn't like a side of king crab legs with their eggs?!

When two of my friends where raving about the dinner they had there before the rest of us arrived, and convinced everyone to go eat there; I broke out in a cold sweat and was having flashbacks to my youth and being dragged to countless Chinese and old country buffets where I would get yelled at my mother for wasting her ten bucks, as I could only bring myself to eat their canned fruit and ice cream and nothing else. 

Silly me didn't realize that this is Vegas and they do things a bit differently here. Where should I start. The sushi, yes I ate sushi at a buffet and it was awesome. The hazelnut french toast with banana was glorious. The countless amounts of fresh fruit, the salmon which I had to restrain myself from taking all of it. Everything I put on my plates was so good. 

Everyone loved the food and I'm told the desserts were so good as well, I didn't trust myself to just have a few so I passed. The buffet is maintained well and so there is nothing sitting out there forever. Expect a bit of wait but its well worth it.

Many of your friends will hype it up so much and so well, saying ""YOU HAVE"" to go here. Of course you listen and after your finished you realize, damn, it wasn't worth $30. 

Most of that high price probably comes from being in the Bellagio. $20 would suffice for the quality of food and selection. 

The ambiance of the Bellagio IMO really is non existent after the hallway where the line forms to the cashier. Then it gets toned down. With the way people talk and tell me about the place, I was expecting super duper extravagant. 

The desserts were really nice, but same affair over at Luxor and is significantly cheaper. 

The crab legs were big and plentiful. Eat a lot of this if you want to get what you paid for. Japanese\/Sushi station was a joke. The California rolls were average at that, seeing better at Todai. The other entries were above your average buffet, which was nice, and which was expected at the price and location. Some entries that included truffles, and welington in the name is always an eye opener. They also had some good pizza. Salad bar is a salad bar, and I did not want to waste my stomach space for that at a $30 buffet. 

This place gets very busy, and the bus boys are prompt with your drinks and clean up of old plates. 

I really don't have anything else to say. I would eat here again, it is a nice buffet no doubt, but way overrated and hyped up. If this is your first time in Vegas and this is your first time at a buffet in Vegas, of course it's almost positive and high marks. But after the initial excitement, you will realize there are better or equal for cheaper.

I particularly enjoyed the kobe beef top sirloin (dinner only) but was a little dismayed by how rare my cut was.  The veal osso bucco was excellent and tender, the meat was very soft and well-flavored.  The paella was also delicious but a little runny.  There was a large selection of grilled\/baked\/steamed\/what have you fish filets, including tilapia, salmon, and cod.  I particularly liked their cod.  The sushi selection is limited, featuring only the usual suspects you'd see anywhere that serves sushi and nigiri.  No eel :(

As for the snow crab legs, they were cold (but aren't they cold everywhere?).  My only real complaint is that they were kind of too salty.  I didn't gorge on those like I normally do at buffets, but that's fine since I was saving room for dessert.

The dessert selection was impressive.  Not only was it vast but the pre-plated desserts were actually complex and innovative, not just variations on yellow cake.  The banana walnut cake was a sleeper hit -- it was amazing and actually distinguished itself from a banana walnut muffin that I'm so used to eating.  The tirimisu had a real alcoholic kick, which I liked.  The miniature ice cream cones filled with vanilla or dark chocolate cremes were delicious -- bonus points to the vanilla one because its cone is lined with nutella on the inside.  As for the un-plated desserts, like bread pudding and bananas foster, I did not try them.  They appeared to be forgotten and unappealing since that section of the dessert bar was not even lighted... o.O 

Overall I was satisfied with eating at The Big B.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive, checking up regularly and bringing us our drinks in a timely manner.  Entree foods that aren't supposed to be oily were not oily -- nothing was heavier than it should be.  So many buffets have trouble with this, but Bellagio's does not.

I was looking forward to eating at one Vegas buffet during my first ever four day stay in Vegas. After some decision making, my fiancé and I finally decided to come to The Buffet at The Bellagio. 

7pm and we're starving. We show up to a huge line. No big deal. An hour wait leaves us thinking ""this food is going to blow us away!""

$80 and an hour wait later and we're finally seated. We approach the buffet area to see mass chaos. Kids running around unattended and generally just people walking mindlessly. 

The Kobe beef was not Kobe beef. I'm sorry, but if anyone actually responds to this and tries to tell me that it was actually Kobe beef, you should be fired on the spot. I've had more tender sirloin steaks from Walmart. I couldn't believe they were even serving that. Prime rib was a bit better but not by much. Chicken was okay. I had some sushi that was pretty terrible - you could just tell it was americanized bs. Everything else was downright disgusting. Pesto mashed potatoes? Some crappy Italian noodle dishes that tasted like Chef Boyardi? Not to mention everything was barely even warm. 

Travesty. The kicker? I woke up in the middle of the night and puked my brains out. And the reason I know it was that meal that caused it is the fact that it was the only meal I ate that day. I can't even remember the last time a meal made me sick. That was really what sent things over the edge. 

I also witnessed one of the cooks refilling the king crab thing. He was spilled them all over the counter. The ones that landed on the counter were picked up by his bare hands and just tossed in. So not only did they hit the filthy countertop, they were handled with his bare hands. Awesome. 

I am just so disappointed. For the price, it is NOT worth it. I'm assuming we caught it on a bad day considering all of the amazing reviews, but bad days like that shouldn't happen. I shouldn't get food poisoning from a $40 buffet, the Kobe beef shouldn't taste like shoe leather, and the food should be HOT.  For the same price elsewhere I could have been eating an amazing steak but instead ended up with frozen noodle dishes. Ew.

Omelet Station - So good!! They have all the standard fixins and you get to watch your dude flip them. 
Eggs Benedict - They used sour dough English muffins which is always a plus in my book. Normally I don't like buffet eggs benedict but these were good even sitting out. 
Chicken Sausage - I have no clue which brand they use but it was delish. I heart breakfast! 
Scalloped Potatoes - they were cheesy! YUM! 

Plate 2: Confusion 
Cheese Blitzes w\/ berry toppings - I couldn't eat them. Maybe because it was more on the lunch side of brunch and they had been sitting out to long. The cheese just didn't settle right for me. 
Bow Tie pasta with chicken and blue cheese type sauce - YUM! Bow Ties and Blue Cheese. love it 
Asparagus - all time favorite veggie! It wasn't even mushy. Nice job buffet guys. 
Turkey - Not gonna lie, it was kinda dry. When I make turkey, I inject it with broth and butter. LOL - COME SEE ME! 

Plate 3: Why did I need a plate 3? 
Moar Asparagus - Told you its my favorite! 
Mashed Sweet Potatoes - They tasted good but nothing special. 
Prime Rib - Way over cooked. Prime Rib should be red, this was brown. 

Plate 4: ""Dessert"" 
Mint Pea Soup - SO GOOD! This was the best thing I had all morning. 
Fruit - LOL... tryna be healthy after eating way too much right? 

Brunch was good overall but I think I expected a little higher quality in the food. I think the price for brunch was great and there was a good selection of food. I also loved the fact my Mimosa glass was always full. 

If I came for dinner I probably would have been a little more disappointed but brunch was good for what it was and the price was right.",2,4,2

So I think now, with the MyVegas app, you can get a comped meal most Mon-Thursday if you at least have a 1 night's stay on any MGM property. Just to go the MLife desk at The Bellagio and present your comp tickets on your phone with your ID and players card on the day that you are going to the buffet. I did get slightly screwed once, as I claimed a free dinner voucher, but the person at the desk accidentally keyed it in as free lunch. So when I got to the cashier at the buffet line, I was only comped the lunch price and had to pay the difference for the dinner price. I was too hungry to walk back and wait at the MLife desk again so I just paid it. Regardless, I still give them a 5 star rating, because that wasn't the buffets fault, that was obviously the MLife desk that screwed up.
Anyway, my favorite thing to get here is always the prime rib, or whatever iteration of prime rib they have here. I always get the crab legs with melted butter as well. I like to go around and just pick at random things they have. Once in a while, they'll have something different. Sure you can get prime rib and crab legs at the other hotels, but it just feels a grade better here. Oh, and for all of you Pepsi haters like me, they actually have Coke products here, BIG PLUS! I damn hate this Pepsi town, so I'm glad they have Coke here.
For the most part, you can skip the sushi. Sometimes they have a few pieces of better looking maguro.
Dessert selection is pretty big, and the sugar-free stuff actually tastes pretty good as well.
I usually finish off with the soft serve ice cream and caramel sauce on top.
The severs are usually pretty nice and come pickup your plates while you get up and grab more food.
Also I may be a little biased because I have a Gold players card and can skip the buffet line....No waiting for me!
I haven't been to every single buffet on the strip, but my order goes something like the following based on taste\/price\/variety:
1) Rio Seafood buffet (I think they just combined the 2 buffets now, but have 2 different price options, not MGM) Unlimited New Zealand lobster tail at dinner.
2) Wicked Spoon (Cosmo, not MGM)
3) Bellagio
4) Bacchanal (Caesar's Palace, not MGM)
5) Le Village (Paris, not MGM)
6) Aria
7) The Mirage
8) Planet Hollywood (Not MGM)
9) Mandalay Bay
10) Harrah's

12) MGM (From here on down, it's not worth your money to go)
13) Luxor 
14) Monte Carlo (The only place I didn't feel full when I left)

Unlike my Paris Buffet (Le Village) documentation... this one will be a bit less comprehensive and a bit more out of memory. But just to satisfy the Yelpers, I've probably knocked out at least five plates of food before calling it a field day with this place. It's also the other reason why I didn't consume as much at Paris (spent majority of the day burning it off walking the strip, exercising, and being in the pool).

Came here for the Saturday Brunch (Unlimited Champagne for additional $5.00, which I didn't get but tried a bit from a friend). Drunken munchies was the name of the game (every moment you wake up in this place it's hangover heaven).

So from total memory recall here's how it went down:

*-My Personal Favorites

Round One
-Lots of Salad (Mixed Greens w\/hints of Baby Spinach; consistent)
-A bunch of Asparagus (nothing to say)
-Prime Rib Slices (2 medium sized servings)*
-Smoked Scottish Salmon (three pieces medium sized; smooth and fresh)*
-Scrambled Eggs (typical)
-A Bagel w\/ creme cheese (had to get a bit of carbs in there for my smoked salmon bagel combo)

Round Two
-Lots more Salad
-More Prime Rib (had three slices this time around, but smaller cuts)*
-Chilean Sea Bass (two small pieces; tasted like butter)*
-Smoked Scottish Salmon (two more smaller pieces)*

Round Three
-Chilean Sea Bass (over seven pieces)*
-More Prime Rib (two more smaller cuts)*

Round Four
-More Prime Rib (Three more additional pieces)*
-Scottish Salmon (got two more smaller pieces)*
-Chilean Sea Bass (got three more pieces, two for a friend)*
-More Salad
-Honey Cured Bacon (I forgot to mention this, but this was also good, too bad I was stuffed up on Prime Rib to get seconds).*

Round Five
-Additional Prime Rib Slice (medium sized)*
-Bavarian Pear Cake (tart and moist, not too sweet but not my thing)
-Tiramisu* (Excellent, the coffee, custard, and sponge cake texture is all there)
-Blueberry Cheesecake* (discarded the blueberry, swallowed the cheesecake whole)

As far as buffet's are concerned, The Buffet at Bellagio is the best buffet I've ever been to so far.  I have yet to the buffet at the Wynn, and maybe when I go there, this will get bumped to second, but I was extremely satisfied.

I'll first start with the downsides of the buffet, which are relatively small and can be easily over looked.  First of all, if you go during peak dinner hours on a saturday night, expect at least a 45+ minute wait.  I can't ding the restaurant for being extremely successful though, but just keep that in mind. The food is totally worth the wait.  Second downside was the price.  I went with a group of more than 8 so they included an 18% gratuity before we even went in so the total price was close to $46 which is a little steep, but hey, YOLO.  Besides, its not like I go to vegas every weekend so splurging on a first time experience was something I needed to at least once.

Now, after I waited out the 45 minutes of hunger pains and coughed up the dough to pay for the dinner, I was in heaven.  Surprisingly, the decor was more simple than I was expecting for The Bellagio, but it was nice and clean.  Who goes to a buffet to look at the walls anyway?  Within seconds of being shown to our table, I immediately jogged over to the food and nearly bit into it right in front of the chefs.  There were all sorts of meats and dishes from different cultures; japanese, chinese, italian, mexican, and more, and each one looked as appetizing as the next.

I started with the heavy foods, the beef wellington, the roasted pepercorn roast beef, the kobe beef, the St Louis ribs, the pork loin, and herb crusted quail.  It reminded me of the scene from the Hunger Games when Katniss went to the Capitol and was introduced to extravagant foods for the first time.  I wish I had a third or fourth stomach so I could eat more than a fair share.  Anyhow, all the meats were superb, except for the kobe beef.  Mine was a tad bit dry, probably because it was cooked 30 minutes before I arrived, but non the less, it was still tasty.  All the other meats were so juicy and spectacular that my mouth is watering as I type this review and remember it all.

After my first plate of heavy meats, I went on to try all the pastas in the Italian department.  There were several pasta dishes which I tried and can't remember the name of, but they were all fantastic as well.  Next up was the japense sushi, the chinese wontons, chinese chicken, chow mein, and pineapple fried rice.  The california rolls weren't all too fresh but they were decent.  The chinese food was pretty good and I have no complaints here.

All in all, the asian food section of the bar was solid.  The real winner though for me was the assorted meats they had which really hit a home run for me.  I went back for seconds and thirds of the meat and ate until my stomach hated me and I regretted it.  I don't regret it actually.  Anyhow, the desserts there were great as well.  Not only was it great presentation, but they perfected the texture and taste.  My friends loved the macaroons and I love the raspberry sorbet.

Two weeks of working out are now required to cleanse my body of the tsunami of calories that hit it.  So worth it though.",1,1,0

Smoke a joint first. I don't kid. You may want to work on expanding your belly capacity. Again, I don't kid. This is some world class excess. And nothing surpasses it.

To those in line for the fruit and the salads? Ha! I laugh in your general direction. When you have a tray of crab legs in eye shot and you chose kiwi instead? That is some lame ass shit my friend. The seafood is always impeccable. And delicious.

After eating lunch at the disappointment that was Pho at TI, I was definitely ready for some real food. The Bellagio buffet has been known to be one of the best buffets in Vegas. I don't think I've been here for dinner so I was pretty excited. My first surprise was actually the price. $45 for dinner is pretty hefty, even for a buffet, but I just thought of that as a challenge to eat my worth of king crab legs and meat for the price of entrance. 

After we were seated, I went straight for the king crab legs, which always seems to be in season here. They were good as always and I probably polished off a dozen or so. Moving on, I skipped all the other food sections and went straight for the carving station. Tonight, they had rack of lamb, ostrich, and roasted duck breast. The rack of lamb lollipops were definitely the highlight of the meal. They were cooked perfectly and the taste was fancy restaurant quality. I think I finished half a dozen of those before trying some ostrich and the duck breast. The duck breast was also very flavorful, but the meat was actually a little bit on the tough side. 

There were also a ton of other dishes that were quite impressive. I had an affinity for the mushroom ravioli with truffle essence, which was a winner over the lobster ravioli. The cocktail shrimp and smoked salmon were also my winners. I think the other only thing I remember that was good was the tiny ramekin with mac and cheese. 

The one thing that I was disappointed by was dessert. The offerings were just not that impressive and they didn't even have real ice cream. Soft serve isn't acceptable at a buffet as nice as Bellagio's. I will say that I did enjoy the sour cream cheesecake, which was probably my favorite out of the group. My impression for dinner was that it was good for a buffet, but it could have been a bit better.",4,0,2

Coming on a Saturday night for dinner had no issues getting in which was a first for me since Bachannel and Wynn typically have a wait.  Once we were seated our waiter came by and quickly got our drinks.

I would say for atmosphere, that this is probably the oldest restaurant of the three and it shows.  I don't let that factor into my rating since we all know that its all about the food in the end.  And while the food here isn't bad, it isn't as up to par as some other the other new comers.  I had come here as a kid and absolutely loved it but now as an adult I would say that everything here is merely average (but you also pay less).

Champagne brunch at the Bellagio is something that can't be beat on your next vacation. For about $30 a person you can drink yourself into a stupor with champagne or make it a mimosa and eat yourself silly. 
Choices include: 
Sushi -- spicy tuna hand rolls, maki, delicate rice paper spring rolls... 
Lamb -- falling off the bone 
Chicken Wellington -- think chicken, well seasoned, wrapped in phyllo dough, baked and then the chicken is uber moist. 
Turkey -- old school turkey with gravy and crispy skin. 
Potatoes -- I'm not even sure how many varieties, but I saw baked potato, mashed potato, mashed with a parsley pesto sauce, has browns\/tater tots, and a cheesy potato gratin 
Eggs -- omelets, scrambled, prepared how you'd like them. 
Prime Rib -- creamy horseradish sauce, grainy mustard, au jus yummy!! 
Lox and bagels -- with capers, red onions, cream cheese, a mustard-dill sauce, and sliced tomatoes and mini bagels 
Too many varieties of salads to list. 
Pot stickers \/ dim sum style food 
Pasta -- pesto style and a bolognese sauce 
Lots of dessert -- cakes, pies, sorbet, gelato, creme brulee, and breads. 
And so much more. I tried as much of it as I could, went back for seconds and attempted to go back for thirds. Our waitress was friendly, kept the champagne flowing, and cleared plate after plate.

We went here for late lunch on a Tuesday. I suppose if we'd stayed another half hour after we finished our meal we could have gotten some of the dinner food as well, but to be honest I was so incredibly full at that point that I couldn't eat another bite.  In fact, I stayed full until late the  next morning.  And I didn't even get to a number of things this place had to offer. 

By far the most impressive part of the buffet was the multitude of fish courses (both cold and hot) and the sushi bar that included hand rolls.  The sushi for lunch was generally standard, but the hand rolls and spring rolls were really delicious. There were at least five different types of cooked fish courses, all executed remarkably well for a buffet. Other favorites were the sweet potato puree (pure heaven) and the creamy polenta. The sliders were surprisingly excellent, although the lamb and flank steak I tried were nothing special.  The cooked vegetables at this buffet are executed really well.  Not mushy or dried out.  The green beans and grilled asparagus were particularly good. Even the pizza here was decent and everyone knows how bad pizza can get at a buffet! 

The only thing that was a bit disappointing here (and only a bit) were the desserts.  I have definitely had better desserts at a buffet before.  For the most part they were really your standard mini desserts with not much flavor.  But even here there were a couple of excellent standouts.  The bread pudding was delicious (and bread pudding can be really dry) and the pumpkin cheesecake was amazing.

Was it because we went for lunch? Because it was a weekday (Friday)? Was it just a bad day? Were my expectations too high because it's the Bellagio?

Even the meat carving station was forgettable.

The cocktail sauce tasted really diluted when I was eating it with the shrimp. The crab legs were pretty salty and didn't have much meat. The broccoli was also pretty salty. The shrimp ravioli was a complete joke because it literally contained a tiny piece of shrimp (I'll include a photo for y'all to see). The Bobby pizza was decent, basically had cranberry sauce and turkey chunks. The grilled salmon with the truffle oil was pretty tasty and crispy, but they weren't really making too many of them because they were probably busy doing other things. The California rolls and the tempura rolls did not taste good at all. I decided to stay away from the nigiri and poke because the fish slices did not look fresh.

IMO, the Bellagio is the winner and it's the dessert that puts it on top!  It was a friend's 25th birthday celebration-fest and we decided to do a group dinner at the Bellagio Buffet.  I called an hour before-hand to give the buffet a heads up that we were rolling with 19 people.  They don't really take reservations so we still had to wait in line but they managed to save us two tables right next to eachother!

There's sooo much food I didn't know where to start!  The meat carving station was serving up kobe beef, prime rib, ostrich, turkey, beef wellington, and more!  The kobe beef and prime rib were SO deliciously tender.  Other highlights: poke tuna (so fresh), prepared salads area, pastas, vegetarian pizza, mac n cheese, three different kinds of potatoes!!!  

For dessert I limited myself to three dishes and had the apple pie (really yummy), coconut macaroon (just okay), and the DELICIOUS chocolate covered strawberries.  They were dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and swirled chocolate covered. YUMMMMMM.

After tax and gratutity (because we had a large party) it came out to be about $45 per person for the Saturday night dinner buffet.

My favorites were the tiramisu, black and white chocolate ""bomb,"" and the mini pecan pie with a chocolate surprise in the middle! (the crust on that was to die for!!!)

This place was definitely worth the value, and DEFINITELY worth the wait. The line for brunch loked intimidating, extending out the door and around the corner into the casino, but it went by fast, maybe 15 minutes. The server we had was great. Sodas are included in the buffet price, but alcoholic drinks are unlimited for $8. I had a ""virgin"" bloody mary and it was spicy but delish.

I loved it!",2,1,1

It wasn't exactly up to par with the Bacchanal Buffet at the Caesar's Palace or the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio. Nonetheless, having the tiny tummy that I do, all it took was 4 rounds before I could hardly get up anymore and I will say, I was contented.

My parents and I decided to spice up family day by trying out the buffet at the Aria but when we got there, we were told it was under renovation so we diverted our route to plan B and that was either Bellagio or Wynn. Seeing as Bellagio was not too far away, we settled here for lunch. At 12:30pm, there were hardly any lines and we were seated almost right away at our table. I was almost completely aware that our server seemed very very tired. Thankfully, he ended his shift not too long after we arrived and Victor took over for the rest of our dining experience. 

Changing gears for a second, the food made its mark on my family. 5 Cheese Tortellini in Pesto held a special place on my plate almost every time I went back. There was sushi, a variety of cheese, cold cuts, cous cous, salads and fresh vegetable rolls (please avoid these) for appetizers and plenty more. An array of main course options included pineapple fried rice (it had an exotic touch to it which I loved), beef flank, jumbo shrimp cocktail, pizza, pastas. I have to say though, that the dessert didn't really live up to my expectations. I was hoping they'd have more ice-cream options but instead, they only offered chocolate, vanilla and a couple of sorbets. No creme brulee or macarons like I wished. 

NOTE that they boot up the dishes for dinner (king crab in the house!) at 3:30pm so take your time with lunch and just wait till the hour strikes and feast upon the magical extras! Our server, Victor, was more than entertaining and after noticing how much I loved dessert (and at that point, couldn't quite get up to grab any more), he brought me and my mom some tiramisu and raspberry cheesecake shooters which were the bomb! I am absolutely thankful for his pleasant service and how he would occasionally drop by our table to joke around with my dad. 

Keep this buffet on top of your list, but place it up number 3 or 4 for back-up!",3,2,1

The Good

- easy to find
- friendly servers, probably some of the more friendly staff I have met thus far
- never had a problem with a huge crowd\/line in front of one particular item 
- lots of premium meat choices (beloved crab legs, lamb, etc.)
- vegetarian friendly
- line moved quickly @ 5:30pm on a Friday

The Bad

- nothing remarkable about the food overall, v standard
- could use more variety in ethnic food
- dessert did not impress :(

What did I end up eating personally?

- Street Tacos
- Too many different types of pasta
- Crab legs
- assorted desserts
- tea, thank you lord

The buffets at Wynn - all three meals: somewhat more impressed, but not enough to return. I decided buffets were not for me.

So what happened? As luck would have it, I ended up in Las Vegas at the same time that my brother was visiting. We have different tastes in restaurants, and a buffet seemed like a good compromise. He thought Bellagio was pretty good, so off we went.

The buffet area is busy and not particularly pretty. It feels a lot like an upscale cafeteria - not bad, but lacking character. No big deal. Service was fine, with drinks coming quickly, and dirty plates being cleared quickly. I still haven't figured out how buffet staff know not to give your table away when you get up to get seconds (and thirds and...), but somehow it works.

Compared to Wynn, the selection at Bellagio is smaller, and the overall quality is about the same. However, Bellagio has a few dishes that are more interesting, or of better quality. The evening I was there, the standouts were:
     Beef Wellington with Bearnaise Sauce. The pastry crust was reasonably flaky, the beef was tender, and the sauce was good. I went back for seconds.
     African Bluenose. Some sort of firm white fish, it was fully cooked but still juicy.
     Whole Quail. There really wasn't anything special about the quality, but I give the buffet extra points for offering something a little different.
     Desserts. The variety of desserts is small, but I'm a sucker for rich chocolate offerings, and there were several that featured ganache or other chocolate fillings. The creme brulee was also good.

There were plenty of other items that were nothing special (e.g., marinated squid that was pretty standard, curried duck that didn't have much flavor, dried out gyro meat). Nonetheless, I give Bellagio the nod over my prior favorite buffet - Wynn - because Bellagio's offerings are a little more interesting. I still think buffets aren't worth it, but if you want to try a dinner buffet, this one is a good choice.

Because of this experience, I went back for the lunch buffet. I should have stuck with dinner. The lunch buffet was very similar to the dinner buffet - minus the more interesting or better dishes. Beef welling at dinner was replaced by very mediocre Chicken Wellington at lunch. African bluenose, cooked so nicely at dinner, was dry at lunch. Leg of lamb was plain and didn't taste of much anything.

If you're interested in a lunch buffet, I recommend Wynn, where the quality is very similar to that at dinner.",2,0,1

Their shrimp is always good, I love the polenta, ribs, beefcubes and their bread.  I wasnt too impressed with their 'kobe' beef- its not available everytime but the one time they had it, it was done wrong. Wasnt too crazy about their lamb either.

Servers come around and ensure you have enough to drink: coffee, soda, water so make sure to tip!  

Now the food quality isn't bad.  I mean it's buffet food, you can't expect gourmet and individual dining but it wasn't spectacular.  Most of the seasonings are bland (to cater to the masses) but coming to this buffet is almost a must if you come to Vegas.

The snow crabs is so small that they don't even bother to split in half like other buffets. Jonah claws and shrimp was decent. Other than these three seafood, I don't see any other seafoods. Don't bother to come to this place if you are a seafood lover. It's hard to grab the snow crabs, claws, and shrimp because these were placed on top of large ice and your wrist will get in contact the sneeze guards.

There were of course a lot of options to pick from in terms of barbeque meat. some of the best i experienced was the bbq lamb leg, and quail.  there were not a lot of seafood options. just basic choices like cocktail shrimp. 

the dessert was average, however non alcohol drinks are included, like fresh squeezed orange juice. 

The service at the buffet was efficient

definitely i would recommend to a friend, however i would suggest to not go during weekends or holiday periods.",1,0,1

If you are expecting it from a buffet then your not very smart when it comes to eating out.  And if your expectation was judge solely on what you saw on the travel channels best places to eat then maybe you should of done a little research on your own before running in full throttle.

 With that said this buffet is way above average. Much better then most buffet places I have been to throughout the U.S. The quality is pretty good and the choices are just as good.

They have such a variety and high quality of food which separates it from the pack. They have Alaskan king crab, snow crab, shrimp, ribs, beef tenderloin, rack of lamb, kebobs, salad, sushi, sashimi, Asian favorites, pasta station, mussels, squid, and not to mention 20 types of desserts! I know the list above was not in any sort of order, but you get the idea.

This is a place you don't want to miss out on. Being a foodie, ive sat here for 2 hours before. 

Tips:
- come in between lunch and dinner (read between the lines)
- the guy at the pasta station will steam your snow crabs if you like them warm. 
- there will always be a long line so come before the huge crowds for lunch and dinner

Yea buddy this is the business...

this is by far the best buffet ive had in vegas, this city is the only place in the world that I'll do buffets ..so worht the $30+ you spend.
first off get here early, the line to get in is ridicoulous, so be prepared to wait , not unless you know someone that habitually stays and plays at bellagio, ive had the good fortune that my friends parents are like Vip's so we breeze right through the entrance, the one time that i didnt go with my buddy i had a 45 min wait.BOO!

all their food is absolutey delicious, so much flavor, the omellette station the sushi bar, cutesy pastires, soft serve ice cream, ive only been here for brunch, i can only imagine that the dinner is like amazeballs..the attendants are always cleaninf up your plates and coming thru with refills and such.

They had a good selection of food and desserts. All of which tasted very good. I even had the audacity to try their crab meat. Which is saying a lot since it is a buffet after all and I am allergic to shell fish. However, the crab was sweet and delicious and I did not suffer from any food poisoning (insert cheers). The place might get a little crowded and chaotic depending on the time of day but overall a positive experience.

They were all delicious.

Just to throw in a negative, I found this buffet to be way more compact than every other buffet I've been to. 

Still, this place will always be on my to-go list on my future trips.  I've ate at other buffets (including the buffet at Rio, Cravings at Mirage, Wicked Spoon), and I'll put Bellagio's ahead of them (although Wicked Spoon might be as good).

I wanted to try a new buffet in Vegas so decided to try the one in Bellagio. We arrived around 2pm on a Saturday so that we can try the gourmet dinner that starts at 3pm. The weekend brunch is just alright, the only great thing are the crab legs and the omelette. When 3pm rolled around, I was excited to try the lamb chop. After asking several times and being told it would be ready in 5 min, the lamb chops did not get served till 3:40pm. Even though it was only 40 min late, that is still false advertising! When I did finally try the lamb chops, it was not good at all. I took one bite and couldn't have any more.

Food: I didn't try the crab legs but I heard it was just alright. I got lots of sushi though! I ate the fish and thew away the rice. Some weird arse sticky rice they used for sushi! I didn't try their steak but that's because they made it too bloody so I passed on that. Got the bbq lamb thingy, that wasn't too bad. I like their pastas, but not so much for their pizza, yuck!

Generally we are not huge fans of buffets but the Bellagio is famous for being on the classier end as far as hotels on the strip go so we thought if any buffet would be nice this would be the one. We were excited.

First, before we even made it into the buffet we had an a confrontation with an older woman because she tried to cut us & the family behind us in the line. When we got there the line was formed in a straight line & the barrier had not been put up yet because there just weren't that many people. After waiting in a straight line for quite some time, a mob of people came in through the side line up & the a woman & her husband got very aggressive with us & tried to cut us & the large family behind us by claiming that ""the line starts here."" We had already been waiting there for 20 minutes before she had come so of course we did not allow her to cut, fair is fair, however I feel like the hotel could do a better job organizing the lines & monitoring the crowd because when people are hungry they start to act like animals. Anyway that was a minor thing our biggest issue was the staff once we were inside.

Our waiter was a man who acted like he was clinically depressed. He did not smile, he looked angry, he came by to ask us if we needed refills & such but he seemed very reluctant to do so. I really don't expect servers to be extremely upbeat or kiss my behind or anything but this guy just seemed like he was over his job already. We were afraid to ask him for service because he was not an approachable person. He was a really tall, older man & I thought maybe he was just tired but when I saw that he was smiling for the table next to us I was in shock. We are a real quiet bunch so I didn't understand why this was happening. 

If the scary attitude wasn't bad enough this same waiter was flirting & kissing another waitress right next to my table while I was trying to enjoy my food. Our table was right next to the entrance to the back busser room where all the waiters would come in & out of. Literally less then a foot away from my seat, these two servers were touching & feeling each other. I was surprised that they were out in the open like that & no one said anything about it. I am not a prude but seriously, I'm trying to eat, can you do that on your own time?

The service was appalling considering this is a 5 star hotel (or at least I thought it was?) & the free show with the wait staff was something I could have done without. 

We came for lunch & the food was mostly leftover breakfast foods. There were no sushi rolls at all which we were looking forward too. We weren't sure why we paid for lunch when majority of the food was leftover breakfast items. We came in towards 2:30 P.M. which is near the end of the lunch service so I didn't understand why there were still eggs Benedict, sausages, & scrambled eggs. The green beans were in a section labeled as strawberry sauce (obviously from breakfast). Basically no one is doing their job. There are tons of buffets on the strip, I think I will check out Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo or the Wynn Buffet & hope for a better experience in the future instead of coming back here. Seems like even if you go to a upper scale hotel quality has really come down.",1,1,1

I tried to be careful to not have Kogi-syndrome and automatically praise the champagne brunch in an attempt to justify the outrageous wait time (although I recognize some people really do like Kogi on its own merits [Geneva W.!]). I grabbed a plate and started to do a lap around the course before settling on any given item. After walking for about 15 seconds I realized I had already reached the end of the line. I was happy to have been able to add another thing to my list of ""ways to break my heart in under 30 seconds.""

While the dessert station was good, it in no way made up for the fact that the only item worth my time was the prime rib. As if to mock me, the au jus was placed in an area nowhere near the meat station and was subsequently discovered on my walk out.

The food is really rich but still tasty.  It's like any other good buffet.  BUT the selling point, the reason why this place gets a 4-star review is because of.... THE DESSERTS!  SO MUCH VARIETY and SO GOOD!  Ask your server for a cup of their black coffee (also really good!) and it just tops off your meal.

I was looking forward to having a nice Saturday Champagne brunch.  The price was definitely enticing..only $28 something including Champagne.  I thought of how much fun I had at the Bally's Steakhouse buffet and wanted to try another ""high end Strip buffet"".  The Bellagio came highly recommended but fell far short.  Nice hotel and five diamond reputation don't equate to kickass brunches.  Not a lot of value for money.

To be fair, food quality is definitely good.  Prime rib was the best of all the places I ate at in Vegas, juicy and perfectly medium rare (at last it appears someone in Vegas knows how to operate a meat thermometer).  Good breakfast foods, especially the bacon.  Downside...lots of filler material.  Crappy looking sushi.  Smoked salmon had the grey bloodlines trimmed off which is a nice touch (shows a bit of refinement).  Shrimp cocktail was bigger than most places.

The waiting line is like Disneyland..it takes a deceptively long time to be seated so don't wait until you're famished and make sure you're not gonna puke from being hung over.  

My biggest gripe is that for a hotel like Bellagio that makes so much damn money off us stupid tourists...why are there no crab legs, lobster tails, or oysters on the Saturday brunch?  I'd expect that from a a place this opulent.  

And the Champagne is a sham.  The $5 extra charge is not worth it.  They're pouring Frexinet Cava from Spain, yup at a whopping $6 a bottle retail, the house beat you even if you tank the entire bottle.  At least pour Domaine Chandon...come on!

The sevice wasn't particularly good.  I think AAA or Mobil's secret shoppers forgot to hit the buffet when they were rating this hotel.",1,0,0

However, that was not the case this time. The Kobe top round beef tasted like cardboard: dry, tasteless, hard. It seemed like someone was trying to make beef jerky. The prime rib was over cooked and lacking in flavor. In addition, we were planning to eat macaroons at the end of our dinner. Unfortunately, they ran out :( .

I guess in this economy, they want to remain competitive and made their price take a nosedive.  That's fine by me.

It sucks that even if you get in line at 3:45 hoping to get the lunch price but the dinner menu, even if by the time you get up to the cashier at 4:01 and beg for the lunch price and plead that you were in line, they won't give it to you.  Trust me, that's what my friend did and we paid for the dinner price.

Typical buffet with various stations offering various cuisines and dishes.  Difference is the quality of food is noticeably better at places like the Bellagio or the Wynn.  I was starving and went straight for the carving station.  I had the guy cut me 2 slices of the prime rib and a slice of the leg of lamb, then got some asparagus and potatoes, then loaded up plate #2 with a couple of pastas and some pizza.  I really like the food here and while I haven't been to a whole lot of buffets in Vegas, this is definitely one of my favorites.  Especially now with the more affordable dinner price.

When all was said and done, I had made about 4 trips and finished off maybe 7 plates of food (not entirely full).  I was thinking about having a little bit of fruit before attacking the dessert station, but that didn't.  I think my favorite dessert was this chocolate mousse with hazelnuts.

While the higher-priced nights feature more foods, even the cheaper nights offer a very wide variety of high-quality dishes and desserts.

The prime-rib is cooked to perfection and is the best I've ever eaten anywhere. This is an accomplishment because many establishments are hit-and-miss when it comes to cooking this popular dish. The pork spareribs, sashimi (spicy tuna and salmon chunks), crab legs, and Italian dishes are also top-notch. There are spicy tuna hand rolls and the usual nigiri sushi offerings such as tuna, salmon and California rolls.

My boyfriend, his parents, and I came to The Buffet at Bellagio on a late Sunday morning (around 11am). The buffet goes until 3pm, is $35 per person (includes non-alcoholic drinks), and expect to wait about 20+ minutes just to order and sit. This buffet is decent -- not bad, not great either. 

Sure, there's enough food and different food options to feed an army of people with different food preferences and interests. There's everything from sushi, to french toast, to salad, to desserts, to getting any cut of meat your heart desires. But, the food isn't *that* good. Sure, I filled up on two plates full of food plus dessert, but when I left, I quickly forgot about my food. I also ordered an OJ, a coffee and some water. 

Service here was ""meh"". The server seemed distracted and distant. Sure, it's a buffet and I get my own food....but when I'm paying $35, I expect them to be on top of drink orders and clearing the table quickly, neither of which I particularly thought they were. 

Overall, just an A-OK place. I'd consider coming back here on future Vegas trips, but it's nothing to write home about.

Reason: because i was fridgen hungry!!! 

Wow factor: the Ahi and Salmon poke! Made me feel closer to home.

What did I have?

1. Ahi and Salmon Poke: it was good considering we were 6,000 miles away from home.  It is comparable to a typical shoyu poke without the onions and had a little more spice to it.

2. Prime Rib: the first buffet that actually gives you a true slice of prime rib...i'm not sure how many ounces it was but the piece they gave me was huge!!!  It was nice and moist and my favorite part about it was that it had a good amount of fat to it. =)

3. Alaskan King Crab legs and Snow Crab legs:  i suggest you just eat the King Crab legs because they are larger and have more meat in it.  They are all already half cut so they are easy to eat.  Don't forget to grab a bowl of hot butter.

4. Shrimp cocktail:  i always end up getting too much shrimp because they look sooo good.  

5. Mussels:  not sure what kind of mussels but it was cooked in some type of red sauce which was pretty good.  If you could just add pasta to it, it would make a good mussell pasta.

6. Steamed Sea Bass: if you're a fan of bass, this would be a good dish for you because it's steamed to the finest texture.

7. Special Roll Sushi: It's just a vegetable roll wrapped with Ahi (Tuna) on top of it.  I would call it a poor man's rainbow sushi.  Good enough for a buffet.

8.  Ahi and Salmon roll: there are your normal strip of ahi and salmon on top of rice.  Remember to grab some wasabi and soy sauce.

9. Desserts: can't remember what I tried, but they had a wide variety of desserts.  I always end up getting the vanilla ice cream topped with nuts and caramel and fudge sauce...mmmmmmhmmmmm

There were a lot more dishes that I didn't name here that were available, the full menu should be available on the Bellagio website.

The plus that I liked about this buffet was that before paying for the buffet, the waitresses allow you to enter the buffet area to check out the food before you pay.

And they let you relax and stay forever without feeling rushed.  

The cons:  Rather limited in the seafood department.  Somewhere I'd heard they had sushi at brunch, but California, vegetable, and spicy tuna rolls hardly count (you can get those in the self-serve deli of any decent supermarket).

Definitely top 2 best buffets I've had!!  I loooooove the carving station here.  I'd have to say that's why I keep coming back to Bellagio.  They always have succulent prime rib which is my favorite here.  They also have other interesting meats during their gourmet dinners such as Kobe beef, tri tip, ostrich, beef wellington, rotisserie chicken...the list goes on and on. 

The other options at Bellagio are good.  Typical pizza & italian dishes.  Decent asian food. Nothing that stands out too much.  It's really the meat here that makes this place.

But the one other thing that I really enjoy here is their cooking station during gourmet dinners.  It's this dish that is in a puff pastry cup.  You can add a bunch of different items such as shrimp, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes and then have a tomato based sauce or a pesto sauce.  There are bunch of other things you can add to this I just can't remember what else was available.  But the sauce on this thing is TO DIE FOR.  Whether you get the pesto or tomato you'll be fully satisfied.  I really really love this and always save room in my tummy for at least one of them.

My friends and I debated for awhile which buffet to hit up during our stay in Vegas, and Bellagio was our final choice. A long line and a $35 per person cost, and we were in. The selection seemed huge, and since I spent $35 I wanted to have $35 worth of food at least.

The food was great, and I couldn't be more happy with what I got. You have so many options as to what to get, with so many different stations. The main dinner stuff was great, but I think I made my fair share of stops at the dessert station. Creme brulee, chocolate covered strawberries, and fruit tarts? I was loooving every second.

Wish I could be more positive about the place because it used to be great in the past. Now the service is HORRIBLE and the attitude of the people here seems to be that they just simply don't care about OUR dining experience! We sat at the bar for breakfast and the employees were more concerned about stocking the shelves and talking about their personal matters than waiting on customers seated for a meal. Don't these people work for TIPS???? How difficult is it to make a little effort to make THEIR CUSTOMERS feel welcome???? That would be the fault of management for allowing this type of service to go on. Another point is the cleanliness of the entire resort. It looks very unkept and unattended. Even the bathrooms are messy and not very clean. It seems like they  are always coming up with new and interesting ways to CHARGE us for anything & everything, at poolside, parking, WHAT'S NEXT???? A casino entry fee ???? Sorry to say but this place just doesn't live up to what is was in prior times.",0,0,0

Nowhere to be found or seen - and I'm serious.  We did not see him at all from a distance or walking around anywhere else....he just disappeared and the service for our table was just ignored.
Trying to get the best of our money, still gave other items the benefit of the doubt and tried a little here and a little there....but nothing worked out.  And this fact was most evident later that evening and the following day when we both fell ill to what we devoured there.

FOOD: I liked their sushi bar only because the had some really good seaweed salad. I mean AYCE and the mixture was perfect between the sauce and the seaweed itself, and it was refreshing with the roast turkey that was being served. The sushi themselves were a bit too sour for my liking, too much vinegar with the rice, and the rice was too soggy. I also really liked the roast beef\/turkey area where the chefs cut you slices of the meat, they were tender with a lot of juice and flavor- loved it with gravy! They had a whole chunk of area for the cocktail shrimp, the shrimps were crunchy and fresh to my taste, but their cocktail sauce was a little weird for me. There was a very powerful ginger flavor to it that I didn't like about. Bleh! But they had a redeeming potato section where they had about three types of baked\/mashed potatoes. They were definitely good, the skin was lightly salted so it gave it great contrast to the natural potato flavor. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw?select=r5mN0kL69yd5vkRNlQ9UWw Now they also have these really cute hamburger selections (turkey & beef), I opted for the beef cheeseburger and was plenty pleased that it was delicious with what seems to be medium done patties (little bit red in the center). http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw?select=AHt4iAMft6EK2y5QBhmsQQ

The crust and large strawberry on top was perfect. Sweet and tart on top with a bready bottom~ MMM! Never liked that coffee-ish flavor so the tiramisu wasn't for me, but the center was very soft and fluffy. The lemon tart was a little strange, not much lemon- just straight sourness.

It took them another 5 minutes for someone to take drink orders. If I'm paying this much, I want them there sooner.

With that out of the way I was impressed with the selection of food. My one other issue is that it is so crowded around the buffet it's hard to maneuver around. Especially with kids. They had rotisserie chicken, a ham carving station and Kobe round carving station, prime rib station (they need bigger cuts), and many other carving stations. I was impressed with the beef stroganoff the most. My son loved the fresh jasmine rice and individual crocks of Mac and cheese. The salmon was pretty good. The tacos were greasy.

2 stars for the service from Esmer

I've eaten at Bellagio's Buffet at least once each time I visit Las Vegas. The food has always been good... this time I had a VERY VERY RUDE Waitress.

This is the letter I wrote to them:
Hello Bellagio Management,

Over the Labor Day weekend my family and I came to Las Vegas. On Monday evening we came to ""The Buffet"" in Bellagio. I've always had fond memories of the food there, and it did not disappoint this time, the desserts were beautiful as always (Compliments to the chef\/cook that prepared the Beef Wellington, it was fabulous)

The ""problem"" I have is the demeanor of one of your waitress named Esmer (Picture attached) For over $30 a head I would've expected much better service, even if it is a buffet. Esmer came over about 5 minutes after we were seated, without a smile or any facial expression except boredom or sleepiness, she asked us what we wanted to drinks, and slowly walked away. Then our drinks came...slowly....one at a time. It gets worst. When we asked for refills on the drinks, it took over 10 minutes, we had a coke at both ends of the table, she refills one, goes off to a refill other tables then comes back and refills the other coke at the other end of our table.

I may be bias because of the bad attitude so far, but I think she gave us a dirty look when we asked her if she can clear off some of the used plates off our table. She said ""Just wait!"" and walked off. When she finally came over to clean off the plates 15 minutes later, she said nothing, there was no apology for the wait or for the fact that we had stacked up all our dirty plates to make room, she picked up 2 of the dirty plates and just walked off. Most of our drinks were empty again, we didn't bother to ask for another refill just to see if she was smart\/nice enough to do it without asking. We sat and chatted for another 30 minutes before leaving, the rest of our dirty plates (about 12) were still on the table, we were sucking on melted ice at this point, we know she was still working, but she never came around.

Maybe it was us, but I don't think so because we said ""hello how are you doing"" with a smile at the very beginning, we put on a face and was nice to her no matter what. She just had a bad attitude from the very beginning. We should've left about $50 to make a 20% tip, we left a $20....it was way too much for her.

As I've said, the food was good, but she's horrible. I've had better service at Denny's. Please have someone re-train her.",2,1,1

We bragged it up to family and friends and brought our family here last night. Not one family member said they'd return. Too expensive for mediocre food. Soup was barely warm and there were only 3 lettuce salads to choose from. Pasta bar was ok. Meat and seafood selection was average!

Well I picked this one because the shuttle driver recommended it. She was sweet and seemed knowledgeable so I went off that. I visited last Friday night by myself and it was $47 and change which was fustrating because I called ahead and was told $38. Still I stayed because I was famished and although busy there was no wait. I had 2 plates and was not impressed at ALL. The crab legs were very watery and whatever elsd I got was bland so not memorable. The staff was friendly but yeah it was a waste of money. Definitely felt cheated. I've had better around my boring town. So my advice is do your research and  unless you're staying there and get a discount... do yourself a favor and skip.,2,0,0

Bellagio always has a beautiful holiday set-up with flowers, model train set, large decorated tree, flowered polar bear, etc... After walking through the conservatory and taking the obligatory selfies, we headed to the buffet to stuff our tummies.

Well, this buffet had all of the same items from the prior Casino buffets, Snow Crab Legs, Prime Rib, Boiled Shrimp, Salad Bar, Dessert Bar, etc... Thus, I will mention the unique items only... Salmon Pate Petit Four, Salmon Poke, Tuna Poke, Beef Tartar, Spicy Tuna Handroll, Watermelon and Watercress Salad, Asian Pears, etc...  Funny thing... I actually tried all of those different items since I had my fill of Crab Legs, Prime Rib, etc. from all of the other buffets.

Better if you have a short one or have one of the MGM big-spender cards which allow you to cut in line (Note: don't expect anyone to like the fact you are breaking in line in front of them.) The evening prices around holidays are around $50 per person, making this one of the pricier buffets on or off the Strip.

You can enjoy lot of ethnic foods, from Chinese to Indian, as befits a hotel that draws visitors from all over the globe. The deserts were plentiful and really tasty. The selection of fruits was not as strong, however, and the salad bar accompaniments seemed much on the thin side. Overall not too bad but this was hardly our favorite dining spot.

Add $6 for a glass of champagne for each person.

There's an assortment of breakfast items such as: scrambled eggs that looked like they had been scraped off the floor and dumped into a bucket after someone had puked on them, greasy sausage links, bacon, a tasteless banana-hazelnut sandwich, mini waffles, muffins (sugar-free is NOT good, and Dad claimed that the sugar-""ful"" version was alright) and pastries. There are also slices of smoked tuna and salmon (which weren't too bad), large shrimps, prime rib, mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, etc. It really surprised me that there was even some pretty stringy-looking chow mein there... it didn't taste too bad, though. Mom said that the fried rice was good, but after the first plate (which I only filled with five small lumps of food; Dad claimed I was making my own gourmet meal), I didn't want to go back for any more.

Dad knew I'd make a beeline for the beautiful desserts (I waited until the second plate!). As pretty as they were, that was about it. There was a pear-chocolate layer cake (absolutely gorgeous), but it didn't taste like much.

I came here yesterday for dinner. This buffet is considered one of the Big 4 Buffets on the Strip: Bacchanal, Wynn, Wicked Spoon, and Bellagio. Including Bellagio I went to three of them. Last night was the first time I went to the buffet at Bellagio. I learned from my previous buffet there's a strategy when you eat at buffets. You need to approach them as if you're eating at a tapas eatery - get three items on a plate. I ended up having 8 plates. Instead of naming every item I ate I will mention the highlights. The chorizo sausage and pork and chicken sausage were tasty. The smoked salmon, ceviche, and calamari salad were fresh and clean. The prime rib was cooked rare to my liking. The baby back ribs had a sweet glaze taste. The chocolate and vanilla éclairs were light and sweet. The rice pudding was also a nice filling for desert. There were three things I didn't like. Even though the pepperoni pizza came out of the oven the crust was chewy not crunchy. I found the snow crab legs to taste a little salty. I wish they served the bones of the prime rib. They're the tastiest part of the prime ribs. Overall The Buffet at Bellagio is a decent buffet. In terms of the Big 4 Buffets at the Strip (I haven't been to the Wynn yet) I would rank in order Bacchanal Buffet, Bellagio, and Wicked Spoon (at this buffet I went at the worst time on Saturday brunch and may go back at a better time).",5,3,3

I'm not sure what the deal was but almost everything was absolutely not worthy of the rating it has right now. 

There's a decent selection of food, from Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican and uh, steaks.

The steaks were really hit and miss. If it was rare enough then it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really seasoned enough so prepare to drown it in Au jus or gravy. Every other time it was an extremely well done piece of leather. When you accompany that with wrong labelling (ie. Kobe Roast Beef which was just regular roast beef [an extremely lean one at that]) you have an even worse experience. 

The Italian pastas and pizza were okay. They were probably my favourite, but I didn't really want to load up on tortellini all night.  The brocelini was really good. 

The Japanese was also hit and miss. If you don't eat any of the rice, then the fish alone wasn't bad. They had tuna and salmon nigiri and a handful of mixed rolls and viet fresh rolls. The thing that bothered me most was the nigiri rice. It's not the right type of rice, it isn't seasoned properly and it's shaped with some sort of rice ball machine that makes it taste like rice paste afterwards. The seaweed salad was pretty good though.

I honestly didn't touch the Chinese and in terms of the Mexican, the paella just had the taste of salted rice, and the slew of poached fish was extremely dry and overdone as well.  I didn't try the made to order tacos.   

The crab legs come in king and snow varieties. I'm not sure if this is their fault, but I found them kinda powdery in terms of texture. Maybe it's because I think they use a band saw or something to cut them in half. 

There was a nice selection of deserts ranging from ice cream to cakes to flans. In my opinion the flans were way too sweet, the cakes had no personality (cheesecake tasted like cream and the tiramisu tasted like crappy coffee and nuts with cream).  The macarons (not macaroons btw) looked and tasted like they came out of a box and were the hardest things in the world.

The place has a small area open for seating, most of the restaurant is closed - no biggie.  There are all kinds of tables, half table\/booth, and full booths open - in the same area that is open.  There aren't people serving in those sections, and we understand this.  We asked to be seated at a booth.  A booth in this same area.  Our request was hemmed and hawed over for a few minutes - which was awkward. The person who was seating us felt the need to get another person to help with our, apparently complicated, request... awkward, yet again.  They both scanned the area (of completely open booths all over the place) and were sorry to say they have no open booths because there are no workers for ""those sections"" until later.  Literally, the first of the 20+ open booths was right up against a booth that was occupied.  This unavailable booth was 1 footstep away from an occupied booth. It shares the same back as the occupied booth.  It's not like we wanted to be seated in a completely separate area of the restaurant.  

My husband and I just looked at each other incredulously and told the person it was fine to seat us at a table.  

After this, it took about 5 minutes for our server to arrive. He took our drink order and while he walked off - AS he was walking off - haphazardly tossed a glance back at us and told us to ""help yourselves"".  Gee thanks.  Where does the buffet start? Are there sections?  We've never been here before.  We didn't need hand holding, but a gesture in the direction of ""salads are there, fruit there, meat there.... Leave your plates and we'll pick them up"".   And as we sat there for a second, laughing at what our experience has been so far - we were stunned to watch people be seated at the empty booth we had just asked for.  

UNBELIEVABLE.  Completely unbelievable.  

The food may be good? We'll never know.  The service here is HORRIBLE.  Hands Down, terrible.  So yes.  A 1 star review from me, and deservingly so. Do NOT go here unless you don't care how you're treated.  We're heading out onto the strip to bring our business elsewhere.

Incidentally, we came to the Bellagio this morning to check it out and reserve a room for the week, starting tomorrow since we have a room somewhere else until tomorrow.  We had stopped at the concierge desk on our way through the lobby and they were incredibly pleasant and helpful - which is why our restaurant experience left us speechless.  We requested a refund and went to breakfast across the street at a different resort.  I'm typing this review as I lounge in a chaise in a common area outside this resort's lobby, while my husband books us a room for the week at the Cosmopolitan, which is right next door to the Bellagio.",0,0,0

You're probably thinking... Which Vegas buffet is the best? 

*The new contender is the ""M"" Buffet which is located off the strip but personally I feel that place is just Hype. Seriously, stay on the strip. The top three buffets in my opinion are Wynn, Bellagio, and the Rio Seafood buffet. Though, the Bellagio buffet always gets me weak in the knees for a bit and let me tell you why... 

Wait: Depending on what time you go you might expect to wait for a bit. Though, no worries... Magic tricks, riddles, and rubiks cubes usually past up the time... If that doesn't work then just know that you're about FEAST like a King. It's not too bad. I've never waited more than 15-20 mins. It goes fast cause remember after all you're in VEGAS BABY. VEGAS!

If you're feeling like optimizing the most out of your buffet experience and want to save your Cheddar for the tables or the bars than just do it the  ""The Poor Asian Man\/Frugal way....""!!

*The trick is to get there at 3:30pm. I'd recommend getting there at 3:15 so you can pay for the lunch price and sample the lunch menu items but then stay till when they switch the items for dinner. So essentially you get to eat lunch\/dinner all the price for lunch which is 19.95. EVERYONE WINS. 

Food: Everything and anything your fat ass desires. Prime rib, sushi, lobster ravioli, fruit platters, Chinese, Italian, American. Ridiculous. 

*If you're in competition with your boys while at the Bellagio buffet for total male supremacy please note..

**Taking a dump in-between the meal automatically decreases the inches on your penis and since I don't have any to spare left I usually drop the kids at the pool post buffet. Though, the satisfaction of knowing that you beat your peers? How much is that worth? That is well worth the satisfaction of a great memory with your boys and some sharp pains in your stomach for the rest of the night. Enjoy folks. See you at the BUFFET LINE.

Though the Bellagio Buffet does not have fancy things like duck or goose liver pate and the such what they do make they make good. Nothing is sitting there too long, nothing is dry (poultry included!) everything is just delicious. 

I never realized that the Bellagio & Wynn had a secret Buffet stand off if you will and I've even lived in Vegas..it took a lot of talking to people to figure that out. So I decided to try both on my recent weekend there.

The desserts at the Bellagio are creative without being too much and absolutely delicious. I have a picture of it floating around somewhere on this computer..

The food was great, I was pleased with everything I got, again nothing to dry or chewy.

Once in the dining area, it was a really chaotic sight.  People rushing all around like it was their last meal.  It didn't feel as welcoming as it could have been.  However, it did appear pretty clean, as far as the floor and dining booths, seats and tables.

The food itself was another story.  It really looked picked through.  I don't think the staff did enough turning over the dishes, so they look fresh and maintained.  Serving utensils were left in and on the food at some stations.  I just felt the cleanliness level was not what you would expect for the Bellagio.

The food was just OK.  I wanted to really enjoy this buffet because everyone raves about it.  But I was not impressed by the flavors, selection and taste.  Nothing stood out.  The kobe steak was tough and the prime rib was not flavorful.  Salads, soups, sides were typical.

LIKES: mash potatoes were pretty good, desserts were nice and were the cleanest part of the buffet, mini mac and cheese was not bad

DISLIKES: the long wait, the flavors and taste of the food, the price.

Unless you are completely hungry and not to worried about cleanliness and taste, then this is ok.  Otherwise, try a good sit down restaurant and order the best prime rib or steak.  It will be better to have a waiter and staff as well.

I only came here because Bacchanal at Caesars Palace was an even longer wait. We waited around an hour to get seated, which isn't a good idea when you're starving. And also, it's not a good idea to be starving and eating at a buffet...

The cost was $45 for lunch which isn't too bad. But I think Bacchanal has more options for the same price. They have an assortment of meat like turkey, chicken, ribs, steak, quail and lamb. I definitely recommend the lamb because it was super moist and cooked to perfection. More often than not, the steak gets overcooked and is rather dry. The quail wasn't bad either. In terms of seafood, they have king crab and snow crab legs, salmon and tuna poke, clams, mussels and seafood salads. Seafood is always the way to make the most out of what you paid! I just wish they had more options. The salmon poke was one of my favorites as well. Dessert here is really good too and I recommend the watermelon panna cotta and the cappuccino dessert (if they have it). They also have a taco bar, macaroni salad, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.

If I was in the area, I would come here again but I still prefer Bacchanal more (since they have oysters and tastier dishes). This place seemed smaller as well so I feel the buffet at Caesar's has more options.",1,2,0

My review is solely on their brunch (will try their dinner buffet next time).

For about $25\/person for brunch ($30\/person for brunch and bottomless champagne and mimosas), you can have all the food and drink you want!  Not bad considering that everything they serve is AMAZING.

They have THE most amazing eggs benedict I have ever had in my entire life!  It's the most perfectly poached egg with the most amazing hollandaise sauce over a mouthwatering slice of ham and a sourdough muffin you'll ever put in your mouth!  When you slice through it, the egg yolk oozes over the rest of the eggs benedict.  I have dreams about it.  Soooo good!!!

Beef tenderloin - melts in your mouth!

Shrimp - huge, succulent morsels of delicousness!

Otherwise, the buffet is only $29.99 for dinner. Lunch, Weekend Brunch, and Breakfast are even cheaper.

I literally gorged myself on King Crab Legs (as were hordes of others). A little butter, garlic, and spice for dipping and I was in crab heaven.

Tip: Pay the lunch price before 4:00 and get dinner options at 4:00. Saves you around $10 a person.

It was not seasoned well, and I think bambi was still fighting for his last breath, because he seemed to be pulsating a bit.

I took my mom and aunt here and stood in the MLife line as I have an MLife card.  We waited roughly 15 mins and when we got to the front noticed the hostess was telling people they were in the wrong line and they had to turn back around.  She was very irate and raised her voice saying we needed to read the sign.
The party in front of me, my party, and 3 parties behind us all held MLife sapphire cards, which apparently is NOT  accepted in the MLife line (wtf).  The couple behind us left rather than waiting in the other line as by then it was quite long.  I told the hostess that the sign is very confusing, which is why we were all in the wrong line.  First off, the card pics are quite small, not illuminated, whereas the word ""MLife"" are big and that's the first thing people notice.  

If 50% of your patrons are standing in the wrong line, perhaps it's not their fault, perhaps you need to change your sign.  I've dined at the Aria buffet and not once did I encounter MLife tier preference for dining.  

The manager was even worse, completely dismissive even after I told her my mom has diabetes and we had already waited our turn.  

I've dined at the Bellagio buffet before and the food was alright; but having experienced such rude, unprofessional, distasteful treatment, I refuse to ever visit here again.  I'd rather go elsewhere and be treated like a customer, instead of being scolded like a pauper.

       - Price - They don't empty out the buffet during price changes so Friday at 3:45pm would be the best. You'd get a $37 buffet for $20.
       - Crab Legs - They had snow crab legs on the left side and both snow crab and king crab legs on the right when I went. Be sure you're getting the one you like.
       - Hot Crab Legs - If you grab a plate of crab legs, you can go over to the omelet station next to the Asian foods and ask them to heat it up for you. I don't really like cold crab legs, so this is a must for me.
       - Desserts - I know it's tempting to stuff yourself with all the great food, but don't forget to leave some room for dessert. They have a huge spread.
**Price**
       - $15.95 Mon-Fri 7am-11am Breakfast
       - $19.95 Mon-Fri 11am-4pm Lunch
       - $29.95 Sun-Thurs 4pm-10pm Dinner
       - $36.95 Fri-Sat 4pm-10pm Gourmet Dinner
       - $24.95 Sat-Sun 7am-4pm Brunch
**Must Haves**
       - Snow Crab Legs\/King Crab Legs - They're split for you so it's easier to get to the meat. If you don't warm them up though, sometimes they have ice on them.
       - Dessert - Their assortment of desserts are one of the best in town. Creme Brule is my favorite.
       - Three Carving Stations - Their meats vary from day to day. I've had good and bad experiences, so I'd suggest going and getting a little from each to see which you like. On the weekend gourmet dinner, they usually have something exotic like elk or ostrich.
       - Shrimp - Their shrimps are usually large and plump.
       - Chilean Sea Bass - They served it with some kind of teriyaki-like sauce. Probably the best fish I've ever had.

Me and my girlfriend went for Columbus Day Weekend. The price was very fair, around $70 for two. Thats NOT including alcoholic drinks package which is another $15 per person which we did not get. Wait was very short, 10 minutes max, arrived around 9am. When we sat down we waited about 2-3 minutes for the server to come around and grab our drink order, but she never arrived, everyone seemed pretty busy so we just up and went to get food in our bellies. 

Selection for brunch was more than enough. They had a simple selection of common breakfast items, as well as specialty items such as Banana and Apple stuffed French Toast, Custom Pancakes made to order, etc. Brunch items? Also, more than enough. 2 carving stations, 4 items. Lamb, prime rib, ham, and turkey. Pastas, sushi, shrimp and crab legs for days. They had polenta, one of my favorites which I really enjoyed. Deserts were also plentiful. People act like you need fucken 20 decisions when you know you can't fit that much shit in your stomach. 

After sitting down with our first round of food our section server kindly took our drinks and rushed back with them. Very attentive and not hard to find, I like that.

For $35 you can have all of the kobe beef, prime rib, roasted turkey, lamb shank, beef wellington, snow crab legs, and king crab legs your heart desires. You simply have to wait in a 2.5 hour line...

Besides the wait, I can't think of any negative to this buffet. The food is great and the selection is even greater! I first came to The Buffet in the summer of 2009 and it took the title of my favorite buffet. I've been here 6 times since then, and I can say that the quality is just the same as the first time I tried their delicious prime rib. (I'm not a fan of their Kobe Beef, though).

And let's not forget the creme brûlée, never forget the creme brûlée. One of the best i've ever tried. Most of their desserts are worth sampling, just don't get greedy because it's a yelp sin to waste food.

Tip: Snow and King crab legs come on ice, but can be steamed if you ask one of the people behind the counters.

As of today, I'd rank my favorite Vegas buffets as:

1. Bacchanal at Ceasar's Palace (I heard this place went downhill recently. I can't attest to that as I haven't been there in a while, but it was great when it first opened)

I really wanted to have a nice Vegas buffet and since I hadn't eaten there before, decided to check out the buffet at the Bellagio. The line was a bit ridiculous but we dealt with it. It gave our toddler an opportunity to take a nice long nap. We probably should have just gone somewhere else.

We hit the sweet spot right before lunch ended and right before dinner started. Lunch prices for dinner food. We had to pay holiday prices, though, which sucked. 

The service there was horrible. We were given our initial drinks, then never asked if we wanted more. We, literally, had piles of plates on our table before they were cleared and not even midway through our meal, our waiter told us he was getting off of work and he wanted to give us our drink bill then (because we might not want more???).

The food was OK at best. Fortunately, we were smart and stuck with the pricier options so we wouldn't feel too ripped off but I still wasn't impressed. The crab legs and shrimp both tasted fishy and the crab legs had ice crystals in the meat, the first prime rib roast they had out was massively overcooked and dry (even the center cuts), the second was done nicely, but they cut the most ridiculously thin slices. Sushi, lamb, squab, etc. was all just average. The pastas reminded me of the pastas at the hot buffet at Souplantation.

The average food and even the awful service probably would have all been forgivable if it wasn't for the other patrons. You'd think these people had never eaten before and never learned manners in their lives! People were literally shoving each other out of the way and cutting in lines for their chance at a slice of meat. There was a line for the squab and one woman not only pushed her way to the front, but proceeded to pile her plate with over a dozen of those little birds.

This ended up being my favorite buffet of all time.  Laura, our server was AWESOME.  She was very friendly and made sure that our glasses were always topped off.  She filled my glass so many times that I started to suspect that she was trying to take advantage of me.

Some of the highlights for me were the pesto mashed potatoes and the pineapple fried rice.  I had many other things that I can't think of at the moment that were also yummy.  I couldn't have the waffles, but my boyfriend and friends loved them.  I think the desserts were a mixed bag in speaking with my group.  There's always soft-serve if all else fails.

I'm sure the number of staff have been cut because they are not delivering beverages any more.  Rather, they are policing tables during a guest meal and then cleaning and setting up for new guests.

PRICES & THE WAIT: it's a bit on the pricey side ($25+) however it is all worth it. Caesar's Palace Bacchanal buffet was about $53 for dinner time and I really regret ever spending that much money on a buffet; the food was a huge disappointment and I wished I used that money here that night. Even when I went to the Bellagio buffet during the holidays, it costed less than that (~$45). The wait kind of varies on the time you go. For dinner you may have to wait 20-30min but I personally don't mind since it's my favorite. 

SERVICE: I have never dealt with a rude hostess\/waiter\/waitress here, so I dont have much to say except that they do their job the way they should. Once, when this  impatient couple was getting mad in line because of the VIP MLife members (they didn't understand how it works), the hostess talked to them in a calm fashion while they were complaining. impressive.

FOOD: the food is to die for. They have a sushi bar that serves tuna and salmon poke! SWEEEET! And if you're lucky, maybe they will have steak tartar. I'm not a huge fan of that but I thought it was a cool food option to have. During the holidays they even had caviar! FANCY! Anyway, they also have a tastey Italian section, Asian section, pizza section... Everything is just so delicious.

* Price: lunch $31 from 11-3 pm. Not too bad considering amount of food available and location. 4 star.
* Atmosphere\/ambiance: huge place. Not much of decor. Very old school but clean. 3 star.
* Location: easy to find... Just follow the sign in middle of the casino. 4 star.
* Meals: good quality and variety but very generic. The desert section is the best! However, maybe it is lunch menu, there is no excitement here. There is a lot of comfort food. 3 + star. 
* Service: just OK. Our server was friendly but  disappeared once we gave him tips! 3 star.

Averaged to 3 1\/2 star.

I have seen the Bellagio buffet on Food network and Travel channel and always want to try it out but most of time there is a long line. This time, there was a short line for lunch. We also got pulled out of the line since they had available table for 2... We were literally in line less than 5 minutes. 
The food is quality. There are salad station, breakfast station with pastries, bagels, salmon, cheese, etc. Carving station has quality steak, sausages, roasted pigs, etc. The Italian food is gereneric with pasta, spaghetti, pizza. The Chinese food station is very small with fried rice, Singapore yellow curry vermicelli, stir fried vegetables, dumplings, etc. The sushi station is also limited with a few rolls, hand rolls, etc. The desert station is the best with so many yummy deserts!  The seafood station is also generic with stone crabs, shrimps, etc. 
I was a bit disappointed since there was no fois gras, duck, or some excitement and creative dishes. Has been to other buffets in Las Vegas, this one is just a OK! It is worth the money but not worth a wait if you have to wait more than 30 minutes!",2,1,7

Aim to get there at the ""perfect time"" this is when they're going from breakfast to lunch or from lunch to dinner. This way you get all the menu items from both dinning shifts. If  you're a meat eater and you're there during breakfast you must try the breakfast beef tenderloin steaks. They are a piece of carnivourouse heaven. Actually I bet when you go to carnivorous heaven this is what's served for breakfast every day with a side of bacon and sausage! 

Don't be a**holes like we were and forget to tip your waiters. They do a great job of getting you drinks and keeping you refilled. We once left without tipping (we totally forgot) and I feel bad to this day! UPDATE: I found the waiter we didn't tip last time and made up for our slip up!

I don't know how the price of this buffet compares to many others, but I had eaten at the Wynn Buffet the night before, and there was an eight dollar price difference (Bellagio=$31.99\/Wynn=$39.99). Both were great buffets, but the Bellagio, in my opinion, had more advantages.

I'd have to say that the Bellagio buffet was definitely better in every aspect with the exception of desert. While the Bellagio definitely had some tasty deserts, in my opinion, the Wynn buffet had options like creme brûlée, while the Bellagio had a flan instead. This pretty much paints the picture for both in terms of sweets; however, as I mentioned before, the Bellagio was definitely the better of the two.

Starting with protein, I loved the meats the Bellagio offered. If I remember correctly, there was prime rib, kobe beef, steak, roast turkey, and more. While the steak was to die for, the kobe beef was more of a disappointment. The prime rib was pretty typical for a Las Vegas buffet, and I had not tried the turkey.

The seafood at the Bellagio was definitely superior to the Wynn. The cocktail shrimp were big enough to fit a mouthful, and there had not only been one option of crabs, but two! All you can eat snow crab was good enough, but when I found the Alaskan King Crab, I was in heaven. Unfortunately, they had been served cold; but realistically it must be to accommodate their many customers. There was also sushi with actual raw fish! However, I did question the quality of the sashimi, as Nevada is landlocked, and the fish definitely tasted like it had been frozen. At least they had this option, as the Wynn had not served raw fish.

In terms of the food in general, I definitely recommend the Bellagio. There are a few thing you have to know before going. After 5:30 PM, the line for the buffet becomes ridiculously long. I was fortunate enough to have been told this before going. I had arrived at the entrance of the buffet at around 5:00 PM, and had to wait only 5 min.!

We have spent around $110 for three of us for the Labor Day brunch deal before we purchased it, and we did. As we entered, the atmosphere is very laid-back contemporary made with the Vegas styled Olive Garden and Hometown Buffet twist. This place also has the finest bar inside, so you can have good alcoholic drinks here!

The service is not that bad at all despite the busiest environment for Labor Day brunch and dinner. No problems or issues at all.

Every food and drinks inside are simply delicious, so let's get started for my plate entree choices!

My first plate: basic brunch meal which includes smoked ham, bacon, turkey breast slices, broccolini, rounded steamed potatoes, seasoned potatoes and steamed eggs. So far, it's quite a delicious first plate for me! The broccolini, ham, eggs, bacon, seasoned potatoes are very flavorful to eat. The downside is the turkey; it cooked very well, yet it's kinda dry for me as I ate it.

My second plate: Simple Lunch foods like penne pasta, steamed Chinese style broccoli, slice of lamb with a jus sauce, sushi, and a red velvet waffle. The goods: everything! No cons at all for my second plate choice! The sushi tasted not bad. Secondary, the penne pasta in Mariana sauce also tasted delicious as well as the lamb and steamed Chinese style broccoli too. Finally, the oh moment, the red velvet waffle tasted incredible! I can feel the red velvet flavor as I ate that food.

Finally, my last plate: desserts and fruits. So far, a good yummy conclusion! The caramel flan tasted incredible as I feel the caramel on it. The sugar-free lemon cake also tasted good too. The fruits, the slice of watermelon is not bad. Very fresh and eatable. The downside: the strawberries which it tasted sourly with less sweetness on it. I'm sure there's an alternative way to grab the fresh, sweet strawberries in the future. Overall, a fine conclusion meal!

In the end, The Buffet at Bellagio is the best, and the most simplest buffet that my parents and I are satisfying a great Labor Day brunch meal! A well, worthy yummy visit right here in Las Vegas Blvd Strip! Highly recommend!",21,13,21

味增汤特别的咸！味增打的也不好，没有清甜的味道。里面的豆腐不是日本内脂豆腐，感觉用的是中国豆腐可又没有豆腥味。没有昆布，只有一些葱花。

越南春卷皮比较硬，应该是放久了。越南春卷的米皮最好的现泡现包现吃。里面的馅料没什么味道，基本是忽悠人。毕竟自助餐嘛（这算自我安慰么？）

中餐的部分基本上看不到亚裔厨师，所以我都没敢试（不是歧视，我见过寿司做很好的黑人师傅的，在欧洲的时候）。

喷了这么多也夸两句吧，烤鸡还不错，鸡腿还行，胸肉肯定是干的，放了挺久了。弗兰克牛排还是不错的，考虑到不知道能不能点生熟的程度，他们做出来的基本就是七分熟已经很熟了。中间看不到粉红色了都。

寿司有手卷，给的是辣吞拿鱼。我也没吃，看着就不怎么样。加州卷是没有鱼子的，撒白芝麻呵呵哒。

沙拉酱还行吧，千岛酱，意大利酱还有蓝芝士酱还不错（不喜欢芝士的，请不要试蓝芝士）

饮料方面lemonade也很奇怪，是没气的，不如叫lime juice好了。 ice tea是没有味道的，我的意思是不甜的，也别想着会有柠檬味。我问了服务员，她告诉我有raspberry味

Location: It's located inside Bellagio. I'm not sure how it is if you drive, since we walked.

There were also a lot of servers, so I don't think there was a problem of not having a server for different areas around the buffet seating area.

Since we had a toddler, we needed a high chair. When the hostess saw my mom carrying my nephew, the hostess asked to take away the high chair. Of course, my mom just said yes to be polite, but I thought it was really rude to that. I mean, there were other tables that requested a high chair and ended up holding their baby half-way through. It's just rude to that, because later we needed to use it.

I mean really, the difference between us and them was what... another 15-20 dollars per person? We got charged so much less because we got in line 10 seconds before they did. If roles were reversed, it woulda sucked. As it happened that day, SWEET. When we got up to the cashier, he told the person controlling the line that we were the last lunch rate folks in. Dinner at lunch prices, cool. 

I was able to try most of the dishes, and I liked the majority of them. One of my favorites this trip (Gulf Shrimp w\/ Cocktail sauce) were plentiful here, bigger than Spice Market Buffet, and very tasty. 

I never understood the allure of the crab legs, those waterlogged fiber-y morsels of dullness, (seriously, are they supposed to be that way? All 3 buffet's crab legs were cold waterlogged and flavorless... what's the appeal?)  but the shrimp were sweet and had a little tiny snap to them (not mushy or waterlogged at all). 

Loved the prime rib, the kobe steak, the lamb (not that gamey) and the little bites all around that I had. This place has the best sushi of the three, and the salmon\/tuna poke was tasty as well.

Also, whoever said that strawberry tart was delicious got it spot on. I loved it. Not too sweet, but a nice way to end the meal.

Will go back next outing. I miss the shrimp already =(

I worried since some people said this buffet went downhill, but after trying it, all I have to say is, if this is downhill, this joint musta been something rediculously special when it first opened!",1,0,0

I also love the fact that they serve king crab here. Most of the buffets I go to serve snow crab, so it's not very often that I get to eat king crab. 

Table service is very prompt considering how busy this place gets. Dirty plates are picked up just about as soon as you are done with the plate and drink refills come around before you even finish your drink. 

There is a carving station that I like, but sometimes it's a hit and miss. The prime rib is usually ok, although sometimes it was too overdone for my liking.

Went there at 4:30 for dinner. Everything looked old. The already super model skinny crab legs were cut in half lengthwise, the salads were wilted, and the sushi translucent. 

Nothing was really great or even good, it was, edible. For $45 a person in just food, I want better than edible. Tuna Helper is edible and I'm only eating that when the boxes go on sale for a buck.

My boyfriend who came for dinner in Dec 2010 was all flattery about The Buffet at Bellagio. The price is expensive, but compared to the other buffets at the other hotels on the Strip, it was about right.

When we arrived around noon, the line was long, but it moved pretty fast. You don't really line up to wait for an available table, but a line to pay the buffet upfront before you are seated, that's why it moved pretty fast, I thought. Within less than 30 minutes, I think, we were seated.

The first thing to do when buffeting is, if possible, to survey the food LIVE! before you pay, especially when it is expensive. but we had planned for the trip to Vegas to buffet at The Bellagio, we'll go for it. 

I first went for the Chinese dim sum menus for a warm-up: the porridge\/congee, Chinese broccoli, chicken satay, and sio-may were all Meh. Congee, my favorite food, could stretch for more flavours rather than just plain. But, they may play it safe, go for the generalities. The pad thai and the wonton soup were just terrible! 

The sushi and shrimp cocktails. I love shrimp cocktails, but theirs were alright. I think instead of placing the shrimps on an ice bath, they could have presented them in glasses with the sauce and lemon. The goal of buffet is to let your customers devour each type of food in the right quantity and awe them in the presentation of the food on their plates\/table. These factors are important in giving your customers a pleasant buffet experience for each type of food offered. The sushi varieties - only 1-2? - were pretty, very disappointing. The spicy tuna sushi, too bad, the spiciness is overpowering the sushi. NO! The seaweed, my favorite too, is icy cold. What???!!! The Buffet at Bellagio is serving an upscale seaweed icy??? So, I took the upper layer, which are not in solid chunks.

The salmon and another type of fish, they were not in great quality, I think. I tried a little bit, and said O NO!!! The salmon is too fishy and the fish is bland? I forgot exactly, but I would not have a second bit of bite of them. The fish +sauces and an Italian bow-spaghetti. They taste like beginner's cooking style. 

The steak! This is the tricky part!!! Their food is served at the right temperature to my plate, but by the time I walked back and seat myself, it was room temperature, depending on the starting served temperature. Especially for the steak, where they serve it at the JUST RIGHT temperature AT the line, you want to take it then walk back. My second serving of steak, I was picking at it after I walked out of the line. It was better! Then, I thought I can't be eating RIGHT THERE with the crowd buzzing by, so I ordered for only steak and went back immediately and so on. Troublesome! But hey! this is what would satisfy my taste and what I have paid for. I am a steak lover!!!

Last, the dessert. I like that they were served in small quantity in small plates, what I expected on the shrimp cocktail. I liked the chocolate mousse with raspberry, my favorite combination on a serving. The cheesecake was great, but the kitchen men didn't beat it well enough I still can feel the sugar texture in the cheesecake. I can't be eating tiny bits of sugar in my every bite of cheesecake. The desserts were good, all right; nothing too fancy on the taste. 

We stayed until 3:30pm, the $31.99 rate. They came out with more cuts of steak - kobe beef and beef rib rack, crab legs, more, but similar types of dessert. We didn't double check to see if the sea bass my bf was raving about during his 2010 visit was still here. He also said that The Buffet at The Bellagio seemed to be the only one Vegas had at that time. Now, the competition is ON!

I love to eat! and I sure love buffets! but over time, I realized that it is wise to choose non-buffets over buffets. To choose quality over quantity, your choice goes a LONG WAY! Buffet quality is always so-so. The featured unlimited quantity is for the starving tummy, but there is only X much space your being - the tummy, the tongue, the nose, the eating mood - can savour at the given time. Overdoing leads to destruction! The only reason anyone should go for a buffet is if they feel like trying VARIETIES, of course, to taste them in a small quantity. Then, the money is worth the buffet! Still, I felt a buffet brunch visit at The Bellagio would still be a waste of $$$! I can never say about their dinner, because I wouldn't go back there again. They lost me at brunch.",2,0,0

Everything about The Bellagio seems to be perfect, I know that its not, but in this business perception is everything!!!

Last night was not my first visit to The Bellagio buffet, I think this was my third, and although it has always been great last nights experience was exceptional.

I started with a nice salad with bleu cheese, amazing greens, dried cranberries, a light vinaigrette and some wonderful flatbread croutons. Followed that by a visit to the caviar station that had a well informed server who served me a delicious bite of caviar, sour cream and fresh made bellini.

I tasted a few of the pastas, one or 2 bites of 4 different ones, all were great but the Prime Rib pasta was sublime, its so rich and the 2 bites I had leave me craving for more right now!!!

The carving stations looked great and the Prime Rib was being cut thick, but I passed on the meats and went for the seafood. Starting with the sushi that had super fresh ahi, served on perfect rice that may have been just a touch thick. Piles of excellent steamed clams could have been served at the best seafood restaurants anywhere, and the hot steamy Snow crab was cut perfect and served plentiful and cooked to perfection.

Lots of dessert choices and my favorite was the carrot cake, don't pass this one up. it's that good!!!

The real reason I had this epic dining experience though was the wonderful service. I sat at a table near the bar so I saw many servers interacting with each other. They were all in great spirits and seemed to like each other ( if it was just perception I'm still good) My table was being taken care of by a very kind and efficient lady that treated me like a king!!!

The other two buffets that I tried were More at Luxor and Buffet at the Aria.  Those both pare in comparison to this buffet.  While I had no line to wait in at more the buffet at Aria had a long line as did the Bellagio buffet when we arrived at a little before 4.  

While there was a line it moved fairly quickly and we were seated within 30 minutes.  Once getting past the hostess and were showed to our seats it is a wonder to me why there is even a line.  More than half of the room we were sitting in was empty and it seemed there were more than enough servers and bussers to handle this size room.  

Well getting past all of these things and getting to the food.  The choices seemed like they were endless.  The buffet line runs the backside of the wall and pretty much runs from one side of the dining room to the other.  

They had:

Kobe beef
Prime rib
pork loin
turkey
king crab legs
snow crab legs
sushi 
poke
breads
soups
salad bar
and the list could go on and on. (And all of this for $26 a head.

Almost everything that I tried here was delicious except for the crab legs and the kobe beef.  It is a shame what they did to the kobe beef it wasn't tender or juicy but dry and bland.  The chef that cooked this meat should be fired as it is the worst peace of steak I have ever had.  It tasted so bad I wasn't even sure if it was Kobe beef or not.  Another shame is the crab legs, these things tasted like they had been soaked in salt water over night and were the saltiest crab legs I have ever tried.  

Getting away from these two bad things the service was excellent and all of the other entrees that I have were just spectacular.  Won't be back to this buffet for a while as there are still many more in Las Vegas to try.  But one of the better buffets I had during my recent trip.",1,0,0

I've heard so many great things about the buffet at Bellagio and how their ""gourmet"" selections offer the best value.  However that is not the case at all.  

This place is still popping, with my group having to wait 40 minutes around 2pm.  Once we got in, we were seated extremely close to other tables and it felt a little weird.  In fact, I think the layout of the place is weird.

I was really excited to try the Kobe beef at the carving station but the piece I received was way too well done.  It felt like I was chewing leather and all the good things about Kobe beef was not there.  I decided to give it a 2nd chance and went back for another piece.  Slightly better but still, the meat had nothing going for it.  Wasn't seasoned well, and I think I can definitely make a better steak.  It just felt like they popped it on the grill and the oven and just forgot about it.

All the other foods are alright in comparison to some other buffets.  I do like how they crack the crab legs in half already for you so you don't have to do work.  Dessert station is the only thing worth mentioning since there is a good selection and that creme brulee is magical.  I probably ate around 4-5.

The buffet probably was good when it first.  The quality of this buffet has probably dropped and I think that's a problem that all hotels face eventually.  They have to find ways to reinvent themselves or just somehow maintain that standard that make them great the first go around.  Unfortunately, Bellagio definitely needs to do that or else nobody will shell out $30-40 again for the buffet.",1,1,1

My future wife and I went there at 5PM on Wednesday, and the legendary lines were non-existent!  Once seated, it was time to select our food.  The sushi bar, hot food and salads were top notch, and fresh seafood was not fishy smelling or just sitting there.  Only gripe was with the ""Kobe Beef"", which was on the tough side.  Other than that, the king crab legs, their pizza and cooked seafood was excellent, not to mention the fancy desserts, which was hard to pass up, even on a full stomach.  

Service was attentive, and everyone received attention, not only the so-called ""high roller"" types, the seats were comfortable, and tables were set in a way where you don't intrude in other people's space while dining.

I believe that though you don't go to the weekend ""gourmet"" buffet dinner for an extra $3-4 bucks, a regular weekday evening buffet is just perfect, even for families.

We kept exchanging 'What happened to this place?' glances during whole dinner. We - hubby, brother & yours truly - used to think that The Buffet was the BOMB but last visit left us wondering why we should ever come back.

Just few examples - 
* Salty icy king crab legs: totally not edible
* Prime rib with serious lack of flavor: I don't mean put a ton of salt, no. I mean just adequate seasoning to bring out the natural flavor
* Subpar sushi\/ sashimi
* Dessert that are pretty to look at but totally deficient in bright fresh flavor or delight to a perfect end of a meal

Why not create a competitive edge with low glycemic dessert selection with stevia (not the Truvia junk... Use Stevia in The Raw) or organic blue agave syrup (Costco carries them), for example? Or how about artisanal ice cream\/ sorbet that packs some awesome flavor?

Really, for the money and time (which equals to money) that we spent and for comparative selections out there... Hmmm.

Crab legs were good, caviar ok, prime rib and rack of lamb good, sushi bad, street tacos good, service ok, deserts good to above average.   It's consistent in quality and range of choices, albeit not near Caesar's. $44 a person equated to 2 hours of dining. Definitely a good choice for Vegas buffet. Foodie out.",0,0,0

The main problem I've identified with the food: none of it tastes fresh. All of it looks nice and hot sitting under heat lamps, but once you take it back to your table to eat, all of the food is lukewarm at best. This goes especially for the meat items - prime rib, kobe sirloin steak, ribs, etc. I was excited to try the Chilean sea bass, but it was overcooked and dry, with a fishy (not fresh) scent. as for the dessert bar, I spotted macarons and jumped for joy - until I bit into one and realized it was as dry as the Vegas desert air. And, the most disappointing of all - the Alaskan king crab legs, which I was sooooo looking forward to. It's nice that they're cracked for you, but they were so icy that I could only taste chunks of ice at one point. Meh...

Our service was pretty friendly, tho and I did like a few items: Caesar salad, chocolate covered strawberries. I've heard so much about how this is the best buffet in Vegas, so maybe they were just having an off day...

Tip: Come at 3-3:30pm and pay the $25 lunch price. Dinner starts at 4pm, so they'll change the plates to hot, fresh (relatively ""hot"" and ""fresh"") foods right in front of you. You can then enjoy the $35 dinner for the $25 lunch price!",3,2,1

My most recent experience was last week, and I'm friend knows what's up when it comes to buffets - the Bellagio. We decided to come here just before our drive home because we knew no one would be hungry after going here. (If you get here at about 3:45, you pay the lunch price but they put out the dinner at 4:00...yes!) All of the Italian food in the buffet is wonderful...the pizza is great.

Before heading to Vegas two weeks ago I looked up the best buffets in Vegas and the one at the Bellagio definitely looked the best for it's price ranked #2 and cheaper than most. So when we went to Vegas I knew we had to explore this journey to the center of my stomach. 

First off I will comment on their service and their lines. The service was amazing! A man came and asked us how many were in our party and said that we had over a 30 minute wait where we were in line, but since there was only three of us he would take us right in. We ordered the lunch with all-you-can-drink mimosas for ONLY $5 EXTRA and it totaled $30something, less than $40 so that was really good. I have to say the lady who brought us our drinks was incredibly sweet and we enjoyed a few laughs with her.

When we got there for lunch they still had half of their menu from breakfast. So for starters, they had two chefs cooking omelets just the way you wanted fresh for you after you pick the toppings you want. They had sausage, bacon, pancakes, french toast, banana french toast (didn't know this existed, but it was AMAZING), and pretty much anything else you would want for breakfast. They also had a huge round table full of vegetables, fruits, and already-made salads. They had other stations for making your own personal salad; ham, prime rib, & turkey cut fresh as you ask for it; an oriental section with noodles and fried rice, soups, a huuuuuge selection of desserts, and they even had a sushi bar with people making fresh rolls right there (which my roommate went insane over). 

The only thing I was very sad about was that there were no snow crab legs as it was advertised online.

There is a Coca Cola soda machine where you can make a unique drink for yourself. There is also a juice dispenser. Drinks are available on both sides of the buffet.

Still had happy memories of the panzanella salad, the tapenade on crostini, Kobe Beef Wellington, and Rosebud's crushing disappointment that the tray of chocolate macarons disappeared immediately and was never replaced, but was made up for with really exceptional little crème brulees. 

Sadly, none of these items were available this trip. I realize you takes your chances with  a buffet menu, especially when you wait so long between visits. (And speaking of waiting so long, the line was surprisingly lengthy for our mid-afternoon arrival, but I suppose we were not the only cheapos who figured on paying the lunch price just before they switched over to dinner. We were successful by a nose, and managed to save about $14 each. This eased the pain a little bit).

They did have a little individual salad station; Caesar was ok but nothing special. Crab leg were served cold, which is fine by me, especially when I saw the eye roll another diner got when he asked the line cook to have his heated. Not one interesting item at the bread station - guess they want you to fill up on the expensive stuff, so we did.

The prime rib was like butta, and the brisket was also pretty tasty. They were carving a large roast of what was labeled Wagyu beef. Now, I am of the understanding that this particular meat draws its signature tenderness from a pampered life of massage and  a high carb diet. I think the guy they carved up for this one had been sneaking off to the gym to work out at night. It didn't save his life, but he put up a great battle against my knife. 

They had a pretty decent variety of desserts, but not the macarons. At least. that's we thought at first. Turned out they had some they were ""going to put out later"". In other words: when the place was full of full-price dinner patrons. But, they did spring loose with them, but they were raspberry and therefore a disappointment.

This is all I heard as my friends videotaped me gorging myself on the crab legs.

Come here about a half hour before dinner if you want to get in for the lunch price.  3:30 rolled around and it was on.  

I went to town on 2lbs of crab legs.  They were cold and salty, but rinse them off in melted butter and you're good.  I also loved the corn on the cob.  The asparagus were crispy, which you don't usually find at buffets.  The ribs and the shrimp went well together.  The mashed potatoes were the best buffet mashed potatoes I've ever had.  

I wouldn't waste time on the fried rice.  It was not the same quality as the rest of the food.  

The only downside of the meal was that I didn't plan enough room for dessert, but it looked just as good as the dinner.",1,1,1

First, I'll let you know up front I'm not the best person to review a buffet.  The problem is, I get full pretty quick. My buffet dining habits are a far cry from those who can eat plate after plate full of crab legs\/parts and chase it with a plate (not bowl) of soft serve ice cream and a pile of cookies or gummy bears. 

Just the same, I'm probably a more astute observer than most people, so here's my spin on the Bellagio Buffet in bullet points (without the bullets because the Yelp app doesn't have bullets). 

The buffet is popular and busy. There is generally a line of hungry and anxious tourists. 

If you have an M Life players card to flash, you skip the big line and get seated pretty fast (via a separate VIP line).  In our case, we passed up about 20 people.  

The staff all seemed capable and relatively friendly (given the challenging circumstances of dealing with a bunch of people, some of whom might not be as civilized as others).  The waiter we had was very courteous. If they take care of you, don't forget to lay a tip on them.  

The buffet has the standard food fare, including prime rib, crab\/fish, popular Asian entrees and enough deserts to fortify a Kardashian behind.  

Overall, the food ranged from good to very good, and when you consider what a meal costs on the Strip and the selections at a buffet, the price is quite reasonable. 

I know Bellagio can't help it, but logistically the buffet layout ( coupled with a sea of people), can present some tight quarters.  Add in some mindless people juggling plates and you feel like you're someone's human bowling pin.  At Aria buffet, there's a much more open floor plan (and what feels like more space between seats) which I think anyone would prefer. 

Another Yelper mentioned Bellagio Buffet ""gets the job done,"" which echoes my sentiment. If you're staying at or near Bellagio, the buffet is certainly convenient and worth checking out at least once during your stay in Vegas.",5,3,5

Finally, we found it but only to be disappointed by the huge line, I read tons of reviews and no one told me this! 

We were favored of course, when the bar tender came out asking around for how many people were in their party. I noticed him fast so I yelled out 2 please....., ""come with me ladies"" :))) yes! We were seating at the bar and wereoffered the specials, $13 gets you all you can drink mimosa, champagne, Bloody Mary, and beer. That's a deal! We put our stuff down and headed towards the food option. 

Steak, sushi, Chinese, Italian, and then you have your breakfast classics like omelets, bacon, sausage, waffles, pancakes, biscuits......they had everything for everyone. I tried this lamb chop and sirloin , oh man it was so tender and fresh! I also had a shrimp and veggie egg white omelet. The cook who made my omelet was so funny and  very welcoming. We laughed a bit when I told him to make my omelet with love, and he did of course. 

I'm not a huge fan of buffets, and when my good friend recommended I'll admit I was hesitant. I'm glad that I went for it and took his advice. Come to the buffet at the Bellagio, you'll enjoy it, but go straight to the bar if you don't want to wait!",5,3,2

The buffet at Bellagio is the pinnacle of Vegas buffetery (sp?)

When you see a line stretching out well beyond the buffet entrance and into a table of poker players, you'll know you found the right place.

Everything here is so good. If you hate something, give it a try here. They'll make it ""derricious"" and you'll be eating pig farts all day long.

Ok, I made that up, but if they served pig farts I am sure they would make it delectable.

I actually hate fish. I refuse to eat it. But I saw a lady grab a plate full of Chilean Sea Bass and I was enticed. Since she took all the sea bass, the chef promptly put out some fresh ones... Why not? I'll give it a shot.

Good lord, it's like eating bacon fat without the negative side effects.

I was sad I found out about this fish after I was done with the usual prime rib and crab faire, but I was leaving this place with a happy kind of full.

All of the attention these days seems to be on the newer buffets at Caesars, Aria and the Cosmo.  After a disappointing experience at the Cosmo, I was left wanting for more and decided to try an old classic.

The holiday dinner buffet at the Bellagio was an exceptional display of Vegas extravagance.  While not much to look at in terms of decor, the endless meat\/seafood selections made up for the poor ambiance.  King crab, caviar, shrimp, seabass, ahi poke, mussels, quality sushi, smoked salmon, lamb, brisket, ribs, beef wellington, prime rib, kobe beef roast, game hens, flank steak, short ribs.  The prime rib and the ribs fell flat, but the rest was very tasty - especially the lamb.  I love that they have all of the necessary condiments: mustard, mint jelly, au jus, horseradish, etc...

I never eat pizza at a buffet - filler - but the pizza here is very good.  The truffle pizza and the beet\/goat cheese were the best.  Some of the specialty salads here were good, but the other sides were just okay.  The big draws here are defiantly the carving stations and the seafood.

Where everything starts to fall apart, is with the dessert.  Ugh.  Really bad 90s era soft-serve and super sweet cakes\/cookies.  I just can't give it the full five stars until they upgrade that section.",5,3,3

I called earlier in the day, and I was told lines didn't start forming until around 6:30. 

When we paid for the buffet, we were surprised that 8 year olds were charged the same price as adults (there is no kids' price; diners 4+up all pay $29.95). We got our seats at 6:25.

I surveyed the buffet quickly before getting food. It seems that the selection and quality of the food has declined since the last times I ate here. 

The Japanese food station:
-I loved the seaweed salad, the udon salad, and the california roll
-The salmon and tuna poke were mediocre. The fish was good, but there was way too much sauce on it
-The beef tartar was not good

The salad station:
-For most of the prepared salads, you have to ask someone behind the counter to give you some, which I didn't really like. There were some salads you could grab yourself. One was a corn couscous salad that was delicious.
-For the make-your-own-salad, the selection was pretty standard

Seafood:
-Crab legs were fresh and refreshing; the best part is you don't have to crack them open yourself!
-The shrimp was also fine
-The salmon was overcooked
-Chilean seabass was the big winner of the night!! It was so flavorful and tender; it melted in my mouth
-Steamed mussels were delicious

Meat:
-The only meat I tried from a carving station was the pork tenderloin, which was too dry
-The sausages were pretty standard

Random sides:
-Sweet potatoes were amazing
-Read cabbage was one of my favorite things of the night
-I also really enjoyed the risotto and German pasta
-Sauteed cabbage and honey glazed carrots were both solid dishes

Dessert:
-I got the last cookie of the night (I don't know why they didn't bake more) - it was a normal cookie
-The bread pudding was good, as was the carrot cake

I was so excited to try out the buffet at the Bellagio.  Reading all reviews for all the buffets in Vegas this seemed like it was one of the best ones.  My family went to Vegas for Christmas to watch Cirque du Solei and we wanted to get dinner before the show.  And the buffet was conveniently located next to the ""O"" theater.

It took us about an hour to get in and we stood in line at 3:30pm.  So I can't even imagine how long it would take to get in during normal dinner hours.  Since it was the holidays, it was $45 per person.  With such high prices and reviews I was expecting a bomb ass dinner.  

Maybe I expectations were too high to be realistically met but I thought all the food was average or below average.  I tried various cuts of beef and duck and thought all the meat was towards the dry side.  Also I tried the foie gras and it was not good.  

I know everyone raves about the all you can eat crab legs.  BUT THEYRE COLD!!  When crab meat is cold I don't really like it and the warm butter didn't really improve the taste either.

I was excited to try all the cute desserts but they were all ok but the chocolate mousse was pretty good.

Even if the buffet was $30, I wouldn't think it was nearly worth it and I don't think I'll eat here again.",0,0,0

And you can have seconds, thirds, or fourths or until you have to be rolled out of there. The long lines at Bellagio suggests that the Bellagio buffet is one of the better buffets in Vegas, but in terms of the quality of food, it's not *that* good. Whenever you make large quantities of food, the quality of the food just goes down. This buffet reminded me of dorm food or even of Hometown Buffet. Bleh. Have you ever seen that episode of Dirty Jobs when Mike Rowe had to clean out the nasty buffet scraps? Enough said. At least the food was presented well. 

This isn't to say that I didn't get seconds. I got fourths, but I felt sick afterward. My fault really. But considering the fact that you're confined to the casino and you're in Vegas, you might as well indulge and revel in gluttony as well as all the other deadly sins while you're at it.",0,0,0

Honestly, when it gets to the fancy $40 per person buffets, the food is pretty much the same. You get all the gourmet meats, all the gourmet desserts, and excellent service. To get anything else would be business suicide especially when you're catering to supposedly rich clientale.

The difference is the wait. The Bellagio used to be excruciating before the Wynn opened but it's manageable unless you come 7pm on the dot. Then I will laugh at you. That's like coming to the DMV after everyone's off work.

There is something for everyone at this buffet and it's good breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

One cute trick my brother figured out is if you come in towards the end of lunch and pay the lunch price, they will switch to dinner with the dinner foods.

They have so many other types of foods it is hard to list them all.  A few tips, getting there at 3PM during lunch allows you to pay lunch prices before dinner starts (depending on the length of the line) but you get the best of both if you don't mind waiting for dinner stuff to come out.   This place is almost always busy but if you have Pearl status in MGM Grand's players club you get a line pass.  It is not terribly hard to get to Pearl status by just staying at the properties so look into it if you frequent this buffet the line pass is awesome.  And the Sunday brunch is quite amazing.  You get crab legs with the Sunday dinner but not much else so I would go at 330 on Sunday's again to get the brunch price with dinner foods. 

The desserts for me were a mixed bag.

3.5 stars. Came here for their weekend brunch and was pleasantly surprised by how much food they had. I was expecting their typical eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, but it was so much more than that. Don't get me wrong, their typical breakfast food was also great, but I was excited to see crab legs, prime rib, and crepes there. While the crab legs weren't as nicely done (cold and uncracked) as other buffets, it was still pretty good. I felt that their brunch focused a lot on baked goods (muffins, croissants, cookies) over hot food, which was a little disappointing.

It seemed like the service wasn't as on par with other notable Vegas buffets and it was a bit more ""run down"" in general. We had to get drinks ourselves from a small drink bar station. People didn't really come by to pick up our dishes. The space overall was a bit more crowded and tables were placed pretty close to each other.",1,1,1

I'm not that into breakfast foods, but of course at that hour many people are having breakfast\/brunch and enjoy the usual waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, etc.  People always like omelette stations. I go more for the lunch food and I thought the selection would be a little wider.  

They had the usual carved meats such as turkey and sirloin beef which were both good and not overlooked or dry.  They didn't have a lot of salads that appealed to me.  They had a basic build-your-own-salad section.  They had cold cut meats, some gourmet salads, and cheese, but I don't go for that. They had a basic selection of cooked vegetables like carrots and potatoes along with creamed spinach which was good.  I had more than one helping of the mashed potatoes as my starch or I probably wouldn't have gotten full.  Seafood-wise, they mainly had cocktail shrimp.  The sushi selection is very basic\/average and the ravioli from the pasta selection wasn't tasty enough to finish.

As for desserts, they had a wide and appetizing selection, but I could only manage a mini pecan pie, flan, and some peach\/raspberry sorbet.  I probably don't\/barely get my money's worth because I can't go more than two rounds!

I'm sure the dinner selection is better, but of course you are paying for it with the higher price.  Lunch was good, but I wasn't ""wowed"".",1,1,1

Beef wellington is not that hard to make at a five star level. I can't believe they can't figure out how to make it better. This is the Bellagio, isn't it? Prime rib and kobe steak also need help.

As of today, the buffet cost is about $37.95 for dinner to make it one of the most expensive one I ever been to.  The wait at line used to be about 2 hours at holiday time.  Now, it's about half of that because tourism in Vegas is down this year at Labor Holiday weekend.

We had a great dining experience.  All the crab legs we can ever have. Prime rib steak, tender lamp chops, fresh cocktail shrimp, and turkey roast that was done just right.  It's a beast of a feast.

The service can improve a little better.  It was sort of hectic as crowd that night was tough.  But once they figure it out better next time, it will be smooth sailing.

I wish I could've taken some to-go. mwahah..

The price (about $30\/each) was competitive with other quality dinner buffets in Vegas.

The selection of foods and desserts was wonderful. The juicy prime rib, and swordfish filets were DE-LICIOUS!

I piled one of everything that I found particularly appetizing and savory on my plate, and I did the same thing with the desserts in an attempt to sample almost everything. That's what buffets are for!..It was all so tasty.

The one thing they can improve on is to have really fresh sashimi and\/or nigiri at the sushi bar. I have yet to see outstanding sushi at a buffet. Maybe that's not possible..=) But I did take a spicy tuna handroll for the heck of it.

Bellagio Buffet 
truly is 
one of the best buffets 
in Vegas.

I also like Le Village Buffet at Paris (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/le-village-buffet-las-vegas). I still need to try Wynn's. It was too crowded when we walked past (also more expensive.)",1,0,1
3898630,KPcvnB17rSh50jdmN59PAQ,Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw,3,2017-05-07,"You are going to get an excellent plate or two of food here, absolutely no doubt about that. But, oh my, the price!

My recent Sunday brunch visit included prime rib, Eggs Benedict, chorizo sausage, peel-em shrimp on-ice and other more mundane breakfast odds & ends. 

However, gone are the golden years for this buffet (meaning when Steve Wynn was at the helm) ... even though it's still ranked among the top of the list in town. 

Back then, I recall Bellagio's Sunday Brunch offering exotic items such as bottomless champagne, Chilean sea bass and caviar, the latter intended to match the challenge of Bally's now-$90 Sterling Brunch. Prime rib and shrimp, quality eats for sure, but also pretty standard fare at most buffets in town. The Asian station had sweet-and-sour eggplant. Not sweet-and-sour chicken or sweet-and-sour pork, mind you. Eggplant. In fact, the only meat at the Asian station was the scraps of prime rib tossed into the fried rice, rather than spend on pork. Instead of Chilean sea bass you get, well smoked salmon, also standard fare. And now the bottomless booze is a $15 add-on.  

Which brings us to price. With tax, before tip, no booze, $36.79. That's a fancy plate dinner at a lot of nice venues. From that angle, this seems a lot to pay for what is largely an AYCE breakfast. 

And let us not forget the silent add-on: parking. Including my stroll of the property before Brunch, I logged 2 hours, 15 minutes inside the Bellagio. That added $12.00 in parking fees to my visit. 

NOW we are talking about a $75 Sunday Brunch, counting booze, tax, parking and tip. 

Hmmm, now let me just think about that.

***** Aside, on the topic of parking. ****

I am 99.9999% sure that, with the exception of corporate casino executives, every last soul in Vegas agrees that charging for parking is a bad idea ... and that charging LOCALS for parking is a D@MN bad idea. While locals don't comprise much of Strip traffic, they add to it. And they especially turn up off-peak, when it's most needed. Even Caesars' management (surprisingly) had the good sense to exclude locals. For most locals, these MGM parking fees are the deal-breaker, the straw that broke the camel's back.

And what do you get for these parking fees? Lil green LEDs guiding you to open spaces. Automated gates that read your plate and flip the turnpike up if you've paid. I salivate over such niceties I ache to have in my Vegas parking garage. LOL. 

One thing these fees apparently do NOT get you in a fully-automated, 21st Century, nuclear-powered parking garage is ... security. Just last month, a car in Bellagio's garage was left on jackstands, tires and wheels stolen. (And it happened at Caesars' Paris garage as well.) The MGM response: Park at your own risk. A risk they CHARGED you for and essentially FORCED you to take. Hey, what about that legendary ""eye in the sky everywhere"" $hit? Has anybody left the casino cage up on jacks recently? This would never happen in a valet garage with well-compensated car-runners but, of course, valets can't get tipped decently anymore given these fees in place, so quality & affordable valet will essentially go the way of the dinosaur. Enjoy your risk.

Such gouging is absolutely slamming tourist spend. $20-$40\/day resort fees, the old 12% Room Tax, the new 0.88% ""Raiders Stadium"" Room Tax, the 9% Nevada Live Entertainment Tax, the 1.39% 6\/5 Blackjack Tax ... and now a $15-$25\/day Self-Park Tax. What management idiots could think all this won't tighten up visitors' wallets? And that slam will only lead to new styles of gouging, to keep the money flowing ... in the short-run. Tug on the teats of the cow every chance you get, spend as little as possible on cattle feed and, when the cow is down to skin-and-bones, cart the carcass off to the slaughterhouse to get the last dime out of it. Of recent, this kind of thinking (if it can be called that) has led executives to destroy once-highly-effective, profit-generating corporations time and time again. So no surprise this parasitic executive mind-set has now infected the Vegas Strip. Next time these casino execs have a conclave, they should be forced to hear a keynoter recite the fable of The Goose That Laid The Golden Eggs. Then maybe they would be able to figure out what their spreadsheets, financial statements and business-school thinkers cannot tell them.

***** Any-who, back to the buffet. *****

Despite it's rock-solid quality, at this price and given it's run-of-the-mill offerings, I sincerely doubt I'll be seeing this buffet again. If you are a tourist on the property, and your budget can tolerate it, have at, you won't be disappointed. 

Or thrilled.

But for me, if on the property again, and in dire need of eats, I will do with a single plate at Café Bellagio, next to the Conservatory Gardens - or perhaps nibbles at Harvest, next to the newsstand. 

To tide me over, until I can get off the property, and eat the same elsewhere ... and for far less.",3,0,0

However, we were utterly disappointed by Bellagio's lunch buffet. It's hotel buffet, only with more options, at premium price, but not premium food selections or quality. 

Service: indifferent and slow. I had to stack up my plates real high so that they can see it, and would then bother to come over to take it away. This was the case even before the restaurant got busy.

Environment: Clean and spacious. Dim yellow lights are not my favorite ambience, looks tired and aged. Flies flying around, should I expect little friends? 

Presentation: the food looks tired, poorly presented\/cut. Look at my photos and decide for yourself, does the food look appetizing?

Food: Uninspired food that are not even up to the standard of food court food. The cooked fish were overcooked and under seasoned. The pizza fillings were generous, but it was average pizza. The sushi were the cheapest quality sushi you can find, no salmon or avocado in it, just vegetables, com'on!! Steak... where's the steak!? In my books, no steak = no buffet, especially premium priced buffets!! Stir fry vegetables, Panda Panda does better, in both taste, presentation, selection and quality!  Egg Benedict, this is my favorite, good hollandaise sauce and runny yolk, yum! But for this to be a highlight is pretty sad.

Dessert: Decent, but nothing exciting and poorly presented. Each slice was cut haphazardly in uneven sizes and rough edges. Sincerely, the food courts does better, at a tenth of the price! 

Price and low down: $28.99 for weekday lunch. If you are eating alone, sure, a buffet here may be worthwhile as you can eat more selections of food. However, I would still recommend to go elsewhere for better value for money. If you are eating as a group, I definitely recommend going to eat at different restaurants, even for take outs.

Food: I start off with a mixed green salad, amazing sushis and raw salmons, then go italian\/seafood(they also have beef, etc, including kobe, but their steak and poultry is bland and under-seasoned to my tastes).

SECRET: make sure to stop by the custom-seafood grill next to the seafood. It's so easy to miss when no else is in line.

The flank steak and prime rib were delicious, as was the poke.  The rice on the nigiri sushi  could have been a little smaller, but that's OK.  The beef roast that they were trying to pass off as a Kobe beef roast was just regular roast beef.  If it were real Kobe beef, that meat would have been buttery tender with no effort in cutting or chewing.  The king crab legs were great, especially when heated!  I don't think anyone knew that they could have it heated, as I was the only one requesting this (or the other people just liked really cold crab).

I went to look for a pair of chopsticks at the sushi bar and did not find any.  I asked the counter person and he directed me to another station, where again I didn't find any.  I asked our waiter for chopsticks and he promptly directed me to the sushi bar.  It was not busy at this time and he did not provide good customer service by saying that he will be right back with some chopsticks.  I did finally find chopsticks because previously, no one cared to fill the basket up.  For this incident with the waiter and other staff, I cannot give a 5-star rating.  I work at the Wynn where customer service is everything and that is why no 5th star.

Other than that, the waiter was pretty good at keeping our beverages filled besides giving me regular iced tea on a refill rather than raspberry tea.  Will I be back?  Most definitely.  Some things can be overlooked.  I think I may have found my new favorite buffet!",1,0,0

It was at that moment that I should have turned around and ran to one of the many Vegas  restaurants run by celebrity chefs.  But against my better judgement I proceeded to pay.  We were greeted and seated by a friendly staff, but the food was just as bad or worse than many of the chain restaurants throughout the west coast.  The food was ok and worse.  Not a single item was grand or great.  The crab (which is supposed to be the star of the show) is served cold with cocktail sauce and lemon.  That's right... no butter!  Instead of the king crab that some patrons rave about they served an anorexic Dungeness crab leg that looked like it was pulled out of murky waters of Mekong River.

Additionally, the mussels were horrible.  I took one bite and got a mouthful of gravel.  I guess the cooks at the Bellagio had no time to soak the with such a high demand for their mediocre fair.

Finally, the dessert was ok, and I may have been inclined to to eat more of the cheese ravioli if I hadn't lost my appetite from the mouthful of gravel that I crunched through my teeth. I might spit out enough to fill that little pothole on Flamingo.

No more buffets for me.  When you pay $70+ for a meal that tastes worse than Chili's in Barstow I think that's time to call it quits on the once glorious experience of the Vegas life.

But I will say that the breakfast stations were BANGIN'. Red velvet waffles with honey vanilla whipped cream cheese and some ridiculously tasty eggs benedict redeemed the buffet for me.

I was supposed to dine at Joel Robuchon last night. My date for the dinner had to cancel for a team dinner that was announced at last minute that he couldn't get out of. I was going to go still by myself as I really wanted to go. However, by 4 pm, I was getting tired and I had been spending money like crazy just for regular food that the thought of shelling out $200 at minimum for dinner didn't sound all that fun anymore. So, I cancelled it and I went with a couple colleagues who wanted to try the Vegas buffet. 

I guess there was a reason I have never tried the buffet. We got some mixed reviews of which hotel had the best one. Some said Bellagio and some said Caesar and Cosmopolitan. We went with Bellagio as it was the cheapest - $35 plus tax. 

We got there and we were pretty hungry. We saw a long line like one at amusement park or at DMV. The line was so long and never ending we thought the food must have been real good. After an hour standing in line and being recited the story of the movie ""Deliverance"" by my colleagues who started going cray from hunger, we finally got to the end of the line. When my colleagues started the dueling air banjos, I was like shit..get me out of here and feed me. Oh, I also killed tons of data plan on my phone playing the video of Jeremy Clarkson toppling reliant robin. We got some good laughs I guess while waiting in line. They couldn't believe I thought Jeremy Clarkson is hot and that I had a crush on him. Now, they thought I was the one going cray from hunger.

The whole thing was anticlimactic. We saw the spread and at first, it looked good. However, it just lacked a certain something that made us want to eat. My colleague, Jay, was telling me he would pound on the buffet hard but he ended up with one solid plate. His second and third were kinda sorry excuse just because he wanted to get his money's worth.

They had the carving table of turkey, chicken, prime rib, kobe top sirloin, and sausages. The also served snow crab legs, shrimp cocktails, tons of different seafood salad, mussels, and fish dishes that looked delectable. There was an asian station too serving fried rice, dim sum, flank steak, and wonton soup. There were sushi, salad bar, soups, pasta, etc.

I had a slice of prime rib and it was pretty good. The rest was just ok. The fish were cold and dry. The crab legs were tasteless and dry. The sushi was poorly made. I did enjoy the prime rib and the chicken noodle soup. The dessert bar was kinda fun and I wanted to try them all but I was full from the other mediocre food.

The $35 turned out to be pricy for what we got. It wasn't good. It felt like a crazy hillbilly mountain-man came out of the woods and butt raped us. The dueling banjo started playing as we exited this buffet feeling defeated. Total bust. Time to go back to our hotel and pound some cocktails.",11,9,8

To begin with: The price under the week for Dinner is 35$ incl tax and then I tip 5$ for the server. So 40$ in total.

Then I see the lineup. This doesn't concern me because I am MLife Noir so I just walk up and get my table but seriously I would never wait in such a long line, especially not for the type of food at a buffet. But to each his\/her own.

The server was nice and then after ordering something to drink I took a little walk around to see what is being offered (always do that and get a picture first before filling your plate and stuff yourself with things you regret later). I mean seriously: You pay 40$ for a buffet, why would you fill yourself up with pizza?

The meat section usually has the best value at a buffet, they had prime rib which was pretty good but not astonishing, Rotisserie Chicken and Turkey as well as 'Kobe Beef'. Now let's stop right there. To actually say this is Kobe Beef is an insult to peoples intelligence. Nothing of that had anything to do with premium Kobe Beef. Maybe Kobe, Idaho. It was bad to the point of me wondering if they got this at a Costco. Anyway...

So after looking around I stuck to the prime rib, some salad, seafood (the crab legs were pretty good I have to say) and shrimp. I was disappointed by the hot seafood section as there was really nothing special there.

The desserts were good quality even though not wide in variety but the lemon meringue as well as the carrot cake were delicious.

The environment: It's Vegas so expect the usual. Yet there were not as many tables like at some other buffets so you can carry your plates without bumping into people every left and right.

For the impression it was good, in the end I had an ok dinner. Was it worth 40$. maybe not but once again it's Vegas so why regret? But if you are at the Bellagio better spend the 40$ on an Appetizer and a Drink at Olives.

Buffet wise I had much much better experiences including at lower graded hotels like the Paris.

Enjoy!

That really isn't as great as it sounds. I'm sure their dinner is better. But their lunch selection is not all that special. Maybe it's because they serve a lot of breakfast foods, and I'm not a huge fan of those types of food. Their banana hazelnut toast was interesting and fresh, but a huge portion to say the least. Their omelets were fresh and made to serve so you can customize it in which ever way you'd like. I'd say my favorite entree there would be the bleu cheese pasta. But that was about it. Their soups were boring, salmon was dry, and chicken skewers looked cool but were really just cold and tough. I just felt like it was a dressed up hometown buffet.. nothing special.

Meats: 2 stars... They were definitely edible. And they had a wide range of selections, from lamb to kobe top round to prime rib to beef wellington... The beef wellington was well done and overcooked... it was almost gray. And the puff pastry on the outside was completely moist and un-flaky, probably from sitting under the heat lamp. The lamb was just okay, a bit gamey, but nothing too difficult to eat. The kobe top round wasn't anything special, other than the fact that it said ""kobe"" on the label. The prime rib wasn't terrible, but wasn't amazing.

Potatoes: I love mashed potatoes, and the Bellagio didn't disappoint. The scalloped potatoes weren't good, though. Too cheesy and just too much.

Asian foods: Honestly I didn't try any of the Asian food options. I think it's a waste of digestive real estate lol. I literally tried a tiny piece of the chicken tikka masala and it was pretty gross.

Seafood: 3 stars... The ceviche was just okay. The shrimp cocktail was PERFECTION. The king crab legs were obviously thawed from being shipped frozen, but they were still pretty good.

Sushi: 1 star... The rice was gross. The fish itself was fine, but sushi isn't complete without rice. The rolls were just mediocre, as expected from buffets.

Caviar bar: 4 stars... The American caviar was good. The caviars were served on either a piece of bread or cracker with butter. The tobiko was yummy too. I didn't try the ikura (salmon roe), because it's a hit or miss even at sushi restaurants, and therefore probably a miss here. They also had spicy tuna hand rolls and steak tartares. The hand rolls were actually pretty good, but I personally think it could have used a slice of avocado and a slice of cucumber. The steak tartare was delicious.

Charcuterie: 3 stars... They had these different cheeses. My favorite was the one that was laced with black. The green was weird, and the pink was like alcohol.

Dessert: 5 stars... THIS was the best part of the entire buffet. The selection was vast, and mostly all of them were on point. They had sugar free options (not my thing) as well as gluten free options, for those who are intolerant. The desserts vary from creme brulee, flan, chocolate options, and strawberry desserts. I think my favorite thing was their Georgia peach sorbet. All of them are pretty much on point. Even the coffee they serve was dark and delicious, and complemented the sweet desserts perfectly.

Drinks: The only thing I wish was that they had unlimited drinks included in the price, just like Studio B. 

Overall it comes down to 3 stars. It's not bad, but I wouldn't come back here. There are so many more options in Vegas!",4,2,2

The array of offered food is amazing, you surely should not come without a healthy appetite. But at 19,95 for breakfast I guess nobody will do that.
To avoid another mistake: don't hold yourself up with bread if you want to have a salad to start with - and do take a good look around first, otherwise you might end up well filled too soon because you still keep discovering more dishes. (lol, thinking about it now 10days later makes me hungry).

Was a bit disappointed with our waiter, who for every other table he worked on had more of a smile than for us - can't say what we could have done, honestly. Since I don't want to jump to conclusions I won't say more. Maybe with all the hovering around the room to get the empty plates off they get disappointed with the puny tips some folks leave... then again, disinterested demeanor is not going to change that.

But still, couldn't spoil that delicous meal we had there ! Highly recommend.

Not everyone eats at the same time, not everyone waits in a long line, not everyone pays the same price, not everyone eats the same thing, and not everyone has the same tastes in food.

And not everyone tasted ostrich before. Strangely, the way it was prepared and cooked, it tasted just like chashu BBQ pork. So it was pretty tasty, but I couldn't help but have a mental image of an ostrich with his head buried in the ground. 

I'm not the biggest fan of prime rib, but I loved it here. It was tender, juicy, and super flavorful. Put some baby mushrooms with the au jus sauce on top, it had me coming back for more. Even when my stomach was about to explode.

The crab legs? I'm always apprehensive because they are the epitome of inconsistency in buffets. They could either still be semi-frozen and not entirely thawed out, they could be too salty, they could have some funky fishy flavor, or they could be skimpy on size and meat. Here, during my recent visit, everything was spot on.

Other favorites include the chilean seabass, salmon, and the braised beef. Nothing I tried was overcooked or bland. When it came time for dessert, I didn't hold back. My favorites would be the creme brulee, flan, mousse with apricot, and the chocolate covered strawberries. 

Surprisingly, the line around 5:30pm on a Saturday night was not very long. It was only after we left around 7pm that it snaked around the casino floor. I thought for the quality and quantity of food we ate, $35 per person was a bargain. By far, better than the Wynn buffet on my last visit, or any other buffet on the Strip for that matter. IMHO.

I am STILL full as I type this but DAMN was it worth it! I'm  usually not one for Buffets(probably because the handful of buffets I've been to out here have ranged from mediocre (The Orleans) to the vomit inducing (Treasure Island)), but a friend visiting from out of town really wanted to go , so off we go. 

We waited in line for 45 minutes, which was a bit suprising for a Tuesday night, but the line moved relatively well, so it was okay. At 29.99 a person, the price was right around what I was expecting.

The highlight for me was the Kobe Beef! Woof! Sooooooo freaking good! The prime rib and roasted turkey were also set up at carving stations and very good as well. Crab legs and shrimp were also tasty, hell even the pizza had a lot of flavor to it! Sushi was solid. Manacotti was great also! They had a huge soup\/ salad station as well.

The desert station had a ton of variety and I grabbed a sampling of each item! Unfortunatley I didnt have too much room left at this point...maybe more another time..

Again, for a Tuesday night this place was bustling! I mean freaking slammed! Kids running up and down aisles and past tables, confused little 4 foot, blue haired ladies traipsing about with plates stacked almost a foot high....I swear there was this one asian guy that had a mess of crumbs all over his face around his mouth piling up his plate at the line..lol..it was the funniest thing I've seen all day! It wasn't just a crumb or two, it was like he dropped his chin onto his plate and just shoveled the food in and just forgot to wipe before going back for more!

It's the Bellagio, so of course it's got to be great right? But, could it just busy and big but not really thaaat great of food? We weren't sure. And actually I think our thinking was just heavily foggy and slow due to the evening before because as we finally stumbeled out of hotel starving we walked a bit and ended up in the Bellagio and the boys said, Let's do the Bellagio Buffet. Sounded go everyone - until we saw the line. OMG, it was like a line at disney land. Ugh. We get at the end and took turns playing the slots as we waited. I was busy on yelp trying to see what the next closest place would be and then it dawned on us, helllooo it's noon, saturday, in vegas. Everywhere would have aline. We were sure it wouldn't take over an hour so we decided to just stick it out. We took bets on how long it would take and my guess was 37 minutes. I won- to the exact minute! So, they do a good job of turning over the tables and there are hundreds of em inside. WE got the all you can drink champagne which was just a few bucks extra, worth it if you are going to have more than 2 mimosas. Our lady was kinda crazy and kept pouring the bubbly all over the floor and the rim of the glass spilling it everywhere so we were a bit sticky after the experience (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars). 
But, the food was good, lots of options, really good salad bar choices, those are my favorite. Don't get me wrong i still pile up the meats, fried goods, sushi rolls and decadent desserts - but i love a good salad bar line up. I'm takling multiple cheeses, lots of dressing choices, olives, fruits, peppercini, yum yum yum.

My wife and I are really not picky eaters but this place was really bad.  We went on a Tuesday evening and it was pretty empty.  The only three things that I liked were the prime rib, creme brulee and a mushroom ravioli.  The other things were either bordering disgusting to unedible.  Some things were so bad I had to spit them out.  I usually never spit out food (only done it a few times in my life).  At Bellagio buffet I did it three times.  And the cook staff (except for the meat carver guy) all seemed uncaring and bored.  And the food that they cooked showed all their emotions unfortunately.  Usually when I read negative reviews like the one I am writing now, I tend to brush them off or try to forget about them and only focus on good reviews cause I really want to try this buffet.  But believe me, you can skip this buffet. I don't know what the other people who wrote good reviews about this buffet ate but certainly it was not the same food that we ate.  I guess it wasn't just us though.  Lots of other people around us was complaining about the food too.  Many people just ate a bite of things and left the rest on the plate uneaten.  This happens frequently in buffets as people like to waste food, but at Bellagio this day there was an unusual amount of wasted food and unhappy faces on customers.  As for the coffee that some people rave about.  I found it to be worst than the regular McDonald's coffee. I drink coffee a lot so believe me when I say the coffee at Bellagio is the worst I've drank in a long long time.  If you want a safe bet, then go to Wynn instead.  You won't regret it.

They have all kinds of different food: seafood, sushi station, pasta, carving station, HUGE dessert selection, etc.

Food
The buffet is very spacious, so much so I had a hard time locating the salad station. There are some dishes that were hit or miss. Some pastas sauces were too soupy, and the meat was too underdone for my liking. The hubz enjoyed the sushi station. He said it was very good. I had to stop him so he could eat other food! My favorite part of the buffet was the dessert. The spread they have is amazing. So many cakes, puddings, ice cream, etc! I ate as much as I could! 

Drinks
They have beverage stations all around so you can get as many refills as you like. They also have a bar in the center of the buffet. 

Staff
They are kinda snooty. The cashier acted like a royal *beep* when we said we had a voucher. Like excuse me? Don't treat paying customers (whether or not they got a discount) that way.

I enjoyed the lamb and prime rib and thank the Buffet employee who put the lamb back on the heat for me when I thought it was too rare. I've had better lamb and prime rib personally, it was still good regardless though.  Roasted duck isn't quite as good as it is at the stores who have them hanging upside down.

The cooked fishes items combined with the Alaskan king crab legs, snow crab legs and dinner sushi options destroy the Wynn's seafood selection.  Of course there is prime rib, but what buffet doesn't have prime rib, come on, your crappy Reno buffet has it.  
  The desserts were really good too, i dunno what my friend Susy is talking about saying they're a mess, they all tasted as good as they looked.  Except those little faux Ice cream cones, those weren't good at all.
  All in all a solid buffet and you'll only need this one meal all day long! trust me.",0,1,0

   I always like it here at The Buffet at Bellagio, especially during weekday lunch. It's only $23.99, it's a bargain for the quality of food they are serving. 

   The Buffet offers quite a few live-action cooking stations such at the eggs, crepe, spare rib, meatloaf, turkey, chicken stations. Guests may choose from the best of Italian, Japanese, Chinese, seafood and American cuisines, offered daily, or enjoy an exquisite champagne brunch on the weekend. Adding to the buffet decadence is a new unlimited drink option for $12.99 per person, for bottomless on Margaritas, Bloody Marys, sparkling wine or beer, quite nice.

   Dinner $34.99, Weekend Brunch $29.99, Brunch with Unlimited Champagne $42.98, Holidays Buffet Chef's Table (Gourmet Dinner) $64.99.

  Their dessert selection is also quite awesome. Their Sushi station is weak, but the carved meat stations and the Italian station make up for it.

  It's $14 LESS than Bacchanal Buffet at the Caesars Palace, but honestly, how much one can indulge before slip back on your bikini for a pool party? You don't want to look 5 months pregnant, do you?

Once for breakfast, and once for lunch.  I ate at this buffet years ago, and remembered it being better than it is now, at least for breakfast anyway.  We first went here for breakfast, and I must say that I was less than impressed with the selection.  It had your standard omelette station, along with other breakfast staples like bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, toast, etc.  The food was all pretty good, it just felt a bit underwhelming for being the ""Bellagio"" buffet.  This hotel has so much glitz and glamour associated with all of its other restaurants, I just felt the breakfast buffet was lacking a bit.

When we went for lunch a couple days later, that was better.  They had many more options such as sliders, BBQ beef brisket, prime rib, etc.  Their dessert station was lacking, though.  They had a few selections of pie\/cake that were ok, but they just have a standard ice cream machine like you might find at Ponderosa.  Other buffets such as the Wynn or Aria have a much better selection of desserts, in my opinion.

Overall, this buffet is just A-Ok.  Not great, but not bad.  The price of breakfast here is around $20 per person, which I thought was reasonable for the Bellagio.  After eating here though, I see why the cost is what it is.  I have a feeling they will completely renovate their buffet before long.  Just a gut feeling.  Either way, it was decent, but I won't be rushing back here.",8,0,1

I came to Vegas with two buddies who had never been. One insisted that we go to The Buffet at The Bellagio. I wasn't even all that hungry after snacking all day long, but we went anyway.

We arrived at about 7:25 on a Wednesday night, and had to wait in line for 45 minutes. I don't like waiting that long for food, especially when there are so many other options around. But it was worth the wait. And the $32.

After we'd been seated, we went to get some food. The table had a drink menu, which we ignored, but did order some Diet Coke. Apparently soda is included in the buffet price. My first plate included kobe beef, lamb, asparagus, chicken sope, chicken noodle soup, bread roll, pretzel roll, and sourdough bread. The lamb and beef were so-so, probably had been sitting out too long. But everything else was amazing. The asparagus was a little buttery and easy to chew. The chicken in the sope was tasty, the salsa spicy, the tortilla soft but not too soft.  

Plate 2: beef sope, Thai spicy beef, fried noodles, pineapple fried rice, barbecue chicken pizza, more bread. The fried rice did not taste good, but again, everything else was amazing. The BBQ chicken pizza, in particular, was the best I've ever had.

Plate 3: more Thai beef and noodles, more pizza, more bread, turkey with gravy, pork buns. The turkey was pretty average turkey, and the buns were getting a little hard. 

Dessert: I pretty much had no room left, but had to try the dessert anyway. Sadly, most of the chocolate desserts were gone. I had a square of cheesecake, some raspberry sorbet, chocolate ice cream, and watermelon. The cheesecake was that kind with two layers (in addition to the crust), which isn't my favorite, but was tasty, regardless. The sorbet was too sweet, but the chocolate ice cream was great.

My stomach hurt as we left. But it was worth it. My friend told me that he can't wait for someone to get married so we can have a bachelor party in Vegas. Just to go to the buffet again.

Also to note: you pay ahead of time and can include tip then. I'm typically against this, but go ahead. The servers are friendly and efficient. I suppose you could leave some cash on the table after you eat if you want as well.

The buffet also has sushi, seafood, salad, and all kinds of other food that I either don't eat or didn't have room for.",4,4,3

Tried the carving station, had a huge pile of crab legs, and a custom omelet. I have a bit of a gripe about the omelets...my fiance and I made it a point to get here before breakfast service ended precisely because I wanted to hit the omelet bar. We got in with about 30 minutes of breakfast service left, and when I got to the omelet station they were already breaking it down and getting ready for lunch. There was only the standard ""huge platter filled with scrambled eggs sitting over a sterno can."" I was annoyed...I complained ""I didn't pay all that money to eat pre-made eggs sitting under a heat lamp!"" Now, I'll give the guy credit...he said ""I'll make you whatever you want"" and so I still got my omelet! That was the right thing to do and I appreciated it. But it seems like I shouldn't have had to complain...most people wouldn't have said anything and would have just walked away disappointed. They should find a way to keep the station open right up until the end of the breakfast service.

Besides that, nothing but good things to say. I had a fantastic mimosa and made myself some sliders on rolls with the meats from the carving station, which were amazingly tender. The crab legs were the sweetest I've ever had...I think the snow crab was a little better than the king crab.

Located right by the slot machine area, the lines build up within a blink of an eye, it seemed. One minute there were a few people waiting in line. The next minute, there were almost a hundred. Wow! It looked like the entire bus load of customers appeared out of thin air! 

The food quality is good. Their waiters are super friendly and will get your drinks filled quickly. The empty plates are removed with stealth. You don't even see who took your plate.

I visited during the late breakfast hour and was pleased to find some lunch foods including salad which is my favorite and I'm not sure why. They also had some pad thai, breakfast tacos, eggs benedict, omelette stations (that's right, multiple omelettes) and more.

Their breakfast meats were impressive. Seriously. They will make you blush. Not just the sausage either. Even the ham chunks were impressive. And the price wasn't bad either. I think it was $21 or so after tip.

Bonus: $10 all you can drink after buying the buffet. But they prefer that you only stay for two hours. That's about $30 per person, but if you really want to get drunk this might be your place. After all, a bucket of beer is $25 even at the middle of the road hotels.",4,2,2

I know it's been quite some time since we have been to the Bellagio buffet so we thought it would be time to try it again. It's Saturday nite and they have the seafood dinner going on. They have the king crab and Dungeness crab (cold) but you can have them heated. The issue here is you get them at one station and have to go to another to have them heated. The size of the legs are about the size of snow crab legs. They did not have any type of steak. They did have prime rib but it was tough as shoe leather. As for the other meats on the line you could get better on a burger at McDonald's. The topper was when we were seated at our table we were told we had to get our own drinks. You pay over 90 bucks and you get your own drinks. Soon they may have you bus your table too. They must have gotten their chefs from most of the fast food outlets as that is the quality of the food they put out. Nothing about the Bellagio buffet is high end anymore so don't waste your money here. They need to bring it back to the way it use to be.,1,0,0

My husband and I enjoyed lunch here on a Thursday afternoon, and were happy to have a much more pleasant experience with the food and the service than when we visited during the month prior.

The servers and hostesses seemed less confused and disorganized from the moment we walked up, however, they were not very friendly and seemed to not care about much personal interaction with the guests as we waited in line.

I had several of the sushi items and a hearty salad from the salad bar, and everything was fresh and delicious.  The Salmon and crab roll was particularly tasty, and the tuna sushi was also very good.  My husband had a few slices of prime rib that he said were very tender and perfect to make into a mini-sandwich with some of the plentiful bread options.  We also were happy with the service we received, which was much more attentive and friendlier than we had experienced prior.

We were lucky enough to visit the buffet during Mothers Day weekend, so we had the holiday dinner option for about $50\/person.  The dinner had some additional items that could have been special for the holiday, such as beef Wellington, snow and king crab legs, prime rib, etc. so keep that in mind as you read my review. 

The waitstaff were extremely hospitable. You don't have to get your own drinks here, they bring them for you. My refills were done before the liquid hit the bottom of the cup. I asked for coffee with my dessert and he brought me an entire pot. Unlimited alcoholic drink options were available for an additional $5 but honestly I wanted to save my calories for the expansive dessert table. 

The only item I was not impressed with was the paella. There was bits of sand in the mussels. However, the rest of my meal was epic.

This is not the case. 

When you're in Vegas (or anywhere, really) you have to remember that a buffet is a buffet is a buffet. 

Sure, they've got Kobe (not really, we aren't in Japan) beef, lamb, sushi, Alaskan king crab legs, snow crab, flank steak, shrimp cocktail...

... but it all tastes like buffet quality food, which is a better way of saying they're mostly terrible. 

Do you know how difficult it must be to coordinate a meal big enough to feed hundreds, if not thousands, or people? Do you possibly think quality can be a factor in cooking these meals?

Where is the satisfaction in getting a thick slice of Kobe beef if it's so tough your knife can't get through it?

Like king crab legs? Then you'll hate them here, since they're all machine-cut, partially frozen, and it tastes like they've been sitting in a salt water bath for a week. 

I wouldn't even mess with the sushi. I'm very, very picky about my fish, and whatever they were serving here looked one step above the grocery store. 

Even the desserts were mediocre. 

If you want to eat well in Vegas, go look up a decent restaurant and drop the $70 you'd spend here there. This last (and I do mean LAST) buffet visit proved once and for all that no matter what they're serving or charging, nothing beats paying for freshly made food. It isn't worth cramming sub-par servings down your gullet just to justify the cost of what you paid to get in here. Unless you have no discerning tastes, or you're just a big fatty who loves to binge eat (hey, no judgment here... do your thing) then this just isn't the place to waste money in Vegas.",13,8,5

The buffet starts with a salad bar.  Usually they have lettuce or spinach as the options for the base.  I wish that they had more options available for salad toppings - a better variety of vegetables and maybe some fruit or dried fruit options as well.  I guess most people don't come to a Vegas buffet for salad though lol

Pricing is tricky...the best times to go are Mon-Thursday for breakfast\/lunch.  The snow crab legs don't come out until dinner, however, but dinner pricing is less on Mon-Thurs as well.

Our original plan was to come here for Thursday night dinner because it's only $29.99 then.  But we had Earl of Sandwich that day and were too full to gorge on a buffet.... so we came here on Friday instead... for the Gourmet Dinner ($36.99).  What's the difference between the gourmet dinner and regular dinner?  Crab legs? More meats?  Anywho, that was my first time trying fresh (..frosty) crab legs, and I still don't know how people eat whole PLATEFULS of this.  Yes it's the ""best"" value for a buffet (eating all the meats and seafood lol), but the crab was salty.  At least the lemon counters the salt!

Whoa... the prime rib was so goodddddddddd.

Made to order spicy tuna hand rolls.... they put so much tuna in it!  

If you have to choose between smoked salmon and salmon nigiri, choose the nigiri because the smoked salmon is unfortunately salty.

I felt so fancy eating here^^

Took advantage of the free drinks lol, sprite, water, coffee... 

We came here around 4pm on Friday and only waited around 40 minutes!!!  Not bad.

First time at the Bellagio buffet and always heard good things about it.

Had a 2 for 1 voucher so the price was really reasonable for us. There is an option for bottomless drinks. Which we added to our buffet.

I'm not really picky about food in general but there was not a single food item that I wanted to go back to. Food quality in general was not even comparable to mediocre buffets in Reno. 

I ended up getting some shrimp cocktail just to be busy with while I got drunk on my bottomless Blue Moon! and just gave up on the food all together.

With all the great things I always used to hear about this place, I left really disappointed. It wasn't worth it even as a half price deal! I guess I've missed out on Bellagio Buffet glory days by couple years or so!

I recently came here during 4th of July weekend and their brunch was only $35.00 where places like the Wynn and Paris were charging $60.00 for holiday brunch (OUTRAGEOUS, and no your $60.00 does not include alcohol).  Regularly it is around $30.00 for brunch which is reasonable considering everything they serve is delicious.  Honestly, I have never tried anything here that wasn't good.  Also they have every kind of food you can want: breakfast dishes, prime rib, sushi, asian, shrimp\/crab (depending on when you come), cheeses, salad bar, and lots of yummy desserts.  

Additionally, the last time I dined her my friends and I also got the all you can drink champagne which is only $10.00 (you can also get all you can drink bloody marys, beer, or margaritas) which I think is a steal.  

The service here is also great, last time we came here our waitress did an amazing job of serving us which I really appreciate because buffets tend to be lacking on their service and I hate when you are dining and no one comes to refill your water for like half an hour.

I went here after being turned away from Bacchanal Buffet in Caesars palace because they weren't taking any more people.  If this is your first Vegas buffet, you probably would be impressed because they do have a lot of food.  However, if you've been to Bacchanal Buffet this place is a rip off especially in the dessert section. I have a big sweet tooth so I love going to Vegas Buffets specifically for their dessert. I don't know if I came on a bad day but they barely had any dessert choices.  There was no gelato, crepes,  and they ran out of macarons. There weren't even any strawberries.  They only had some pastries, cakes, and soft serve, and I think the best thing they had was the creme brulee.  For $50 I expect a feast, and I definitely did not get that.

Many other buffets are either cheaper or offer more choices, but the price you pay for the taste and quality of food at The Buffet at Bellagio, you can't get any better than that.
Two things to prepare you- be prepared to pay a bit more than other buffets, and be prepared to wait in line. It generally averages around 25 bucks per person to eat (price differs between brunch, lunch, dinner, and holiday buffets), and the line is generally around 30 minutes. There are TONS of tables inside the buffet, so the line will move fast, but there are LOTS of folks here to EAT!
The layout of the buffet is great, all organized by type of food, all very easy to get to, and all very accessible. The salad bar offers up tons of fresh salads and dressings, as well as lots of great fresh fruit. Seafood bar has crab legs, shrimp, and select sushi rolls, along with some oysters.
There's always an Italian area, with about 8 different types of pizzas, and tons of pasta choices. A Chinese area offers up lots of your favorite noodles with chicken and other asian delights. There's a meat area, which generally has sliders, turkey, and always some delicious fresh carved meats, including prime rib, roasted chickens, leg of lamb, tons of choices, ALL delicious. Usually some good sides like garlic mashed potatoes, roasted potatoes, mac 'n cheese, and tons more.
And the desert bar... Oh, the desert bar... Tiramisu, Creme Brulee, Tarts, Key Lime Pie, and an Ice Cream Machine. I think I gained 10 pounds my last sitting.

Selection isn't as grand as the Wynn buffet, but again, you get what you pay for. Although I have to say, if anyone who has been to the buffet at  Barona Casino in San Diego, you'll have a better time there at half the price!

The Italian portion of the buffet: most of the pasta was over-sauced or dried up, but that's always the issue when pasta is left out for a while. Japanese side? Sushi is decent, but again, I've had way better. Their side dishes were over salted or overly spicy, which made the dishes seemingly unauthentic. I have to say though, the seafood was fresh, but there weren't any crab legs when I was there so I only grabbed a few shrimps. Fresh and sweet! The American side: mostly the prime rib to critique. It's a small slice and I was pleased it was small because I wouldn't have eaten anymore of it. It was difficult to cut, especially since I was cutting with what felt like a butter knife. Seasoning was lacking, but cooked to a nice medium rare. And as for my favorite part of buffets, the desserts? I was happy with the variety, but unhappy that they looked better than they tasted. I sampled about half of the options, and most of them were too sweet or too creamy or too dry. 

I know that this is one of the more affordable buffets in Vegas and as a poor college student, we always try find ways of cutting corners and saving a bit. But if you're looking for a real Vegas place, skip this place. I still have yet to find THE best buffet in Vegas because no one ever wants to go to the clubs bloated afterwards.

But you have and in a b.i.g. way. It's like your first love, you believe everything they say and think they'll always be there for you. But then they disappoint you like you've never been disappointed before. And things will never be the same again..........alright, the review. 

I'm not a hard reviewer, I always give the benefit of the doubt. I try to find the silver lining. But when you deceive me........with Bellagio it first started with deception. We went Dec. 29, 2015. Beforehand, we checked pricing on the website. It looked legit, brunch $23.99, dinner $34.99. We headed out the door for brunch, 3 adults, 3 kids. We did our usual wait in line for at least an hour. We go to pay and were charged $36.99 for brunch! No discount for the 8 or 12 year olds. They were charged ADULT prices. The 8 year old ate a waffle and a strip of bacon. Total 'brunch' price for 6 people $240!!

Okay, just to give you a comparison, we went to The Wicked Spoon on Christmas. ALL of the kids were $15.99, adults $44. And this is on CHRISTMAS! At Bellagio, we asked why the price was so high. It seems that sneaky ole' Bellagio is charging 'holiday pricing' for TWO SOLID WEEKS!. How convenient that they didn't update their website to reflect these ridiculous prices. By the time we realized this, the kids are starving and there's no turning back. 

They attempted to seat us at a table for four. We politely declined. If i'm going to pay holiday prices on Dec. 29th, I want to at least be comfortable. We finally get seated properly and we're anxious to enjoy some good food. Let me just say, yuck, yuck, yuck. I've paid $7.99 at Golden Corral and have had similar selection that tasted BETTER. The only redeeming quality they had was the crab legs. They were big and full of delicious meat. And that my folks is where the joy ended. 

If I had liked the food, it wouldn't have mattered. Why? Because they weren't replenishing any of the bars in a timely manner. Four of the six pizza's at the pizza station were empty for the entire time we were there. This was the theme over and over again. Out of roast pork buns, out of turkey at the carving station, etc. 

Even the wait staff is disappointed in Bellagio, pointing to the fact that the quality has gone downhill while the prices continue to climb. And their wages don't budge. You could feel the unhappiness frothing in their eyes. And this my friends = lack of love for the customer. Moral sucks and it's evident. I felt bad for them because after overpaying deceptive prices, I don't want to overtip, that's for sure. Unless they do a major overhaul, we will never, ever return here again.

Do yourselves a favor, enjoy the delicious food and reasonable prices at The Wicked Spoon. Oh, and their wait staff was happy and appreciated. We went home and wrote a good review for our waitress, who in turn will get a monetary compensation. This is how you run a good business. No, I'm not getting perks and I don't work for them. I'm a customer who can tell the difference in quality between these establishments. And we will be trying several other buffets while here. So far, Bellagio is on the very bottom of our list.

I've heard great things about this buffet and even some felt that it was better than Rio, so I HAD to try it.  Long story short, its not all its cracked up to be in my opinion at least; in fact, I think its a bit overrated.

My wife and I arrived here about 8:30 pm and there was still a line to get in.  The wait was extremely long and many times the line wouldn't even move for 5 minutes or more.  The process of checking customers in was extremely inefficient and slow.  After standing in line for over a half hour we were FINALLY seated.  The price with tax was close to $70 for both of us.

After being seated were were greeted by a very helpful waiter who took our drink orders.  The table itself was nice, fitted with a nice white table cloth and our silverware was gold in color.  Overall the look of the restaurant was nice and much different from the buffets at the Luxor or Excalibur. 

However after getting food, I could not really tell any difference between the food here and at less expensive buffets such as Luxor; they tasted nearly exactly the same.  Also Bellagio served many of the same foods as Luxor and other than crab legs (which Luxor also had), and mussels, there wasn't really much in terms of seafood.  The California rolls were stale tasting and I could barely get them down.  The selection of the food was no where close to what was advertised on internet websites and I was a bit disappointed.  I am glad however that I decided to go to Rio instead of here on my first trip to Vegas last year.   This trip to Vegas was going to be an either\/or between Bellagio and Rio, but after being disappointed with Bellagio, I decided to go BACK to Rio during my last night in Vegas.  Rio is more expensive than Bellagio, but the food is so much better and there is a greater variety.

While the waiter service was superb, to me the food just didn't measure up to the asking price.  As a result, this will mark my first and only visit to the Bellagio Buffet.   If you don't mind not being in an upscale environment and not having gold eating utensils,  you can get the same type of food at other buffets and not have to spend as much.

I still think the Rio Village seafood buffet is the best buffet I've been to in Vegas, and despite all the raves about Bellagio, I don't think it even comes close to Rio.",0,0,0

eh. 

I thought it would be better. I mean come on....The Buffet and Bellagio. Expectations were high. Seeing the long line, they grew. Luckily one of our party showed up early and waited the 40 minutes to get to the front and then they put him in the side line until we all showed up. Once we did we were promptly seated. Nice.  But then they sat us at a table that was a tad bit small for a group of 9.  boo.

Maybe I was on a buffet burnout or something, but I just couldn't get my eat on here.  For a $35 buffet, it was just ok.  I expected more and better.  The Kobe beef wasn't all that great, the crab legs were small and the sushi\/sashimi was lacking quality.  The lamb chops were good, not gamey tasting and cooked a nice medium rare. The butternut squash ravioli's were delicious as was the seabass.  The desserts were good too.  

Overall it was just a regular buffet. Nothing special. Nothing stand-outish.  And there were too many  things that you had to ask for instead of being able to serve it yourself...some of those didn't even have signs. Too much trouble and not worth the wait.

GOOD:

+ Food: TONS of variety! Each section was pretty huge (i.e. meats, Asian foods, desserts, etc.). Satisfactory taste. 
+ Atmosphere: Bright, plenty of seating areas.

BAD:
- Service: I stepped on and tripped over food that had fallen on the ground about 3 times. Yuck. Clean up on aisle-everywhere, please. Also, for a crazy amount of workers here, the time waiting in line was too long. Not worth it.
- Price: Pretty pricey for a just-ok experience. 
- Food: For the price we paid, my experience here was ok. There was a lot to choose from, but most of the things I ate were only ok. For the price we paid, I was hoping to be wowed!
- Atmosphere: Decor had a 90's feel. They need to update. Also, everything feels so crammed together--I was literally dodging people everywhere I went. Women's bathroom only had 3 stalls too, I believe.  Too small for a buffet, in my opinion.

They had all the standard breakfast foods, sausages, bacon, eggs, waffles etc, but nothing fancy smancy. Like Jon B. said in his review, the food was just really average nothing more, nothing less.

With the price, you get an average selection of breakfast food, some dim sum selections, prime rib, cocktail shrimp,  smoked ham and turkey, pastries, etc. There was a small sushi area with hand rolled spicy salmon which was probably the gem of the buffet.

Inside, there was a hugeee variety of food options. They ranged from breakfast to lunch options to dinner and desserts. I wanted to make sure I enjoyed as much as can fit in my tummy since it was my first time at the buffet. I wasn't much of a fanatic for the breakfast options.

Breakfast: 

French-toast - least favorite\/lacked flavor 
Pancakes 
Breakfast potatoes 
Cereal 
Omelette 
 .

Lunch\/Dinner : 

Ravioli (****AMAZING****)
Chicken wings 
Veggie soup 
Mashed potato w\/ gravy - least favorite 

Dessert: 

Tiny fun size pumpkin pie slice 
Fruit 
Flan - least favorite 


Again, those were the portions I chose to eat Keep in mind there are plenty more options. .I payed $40 for entry and the drinks along with condiments (ketchup , drinks, milk . etc) are brought out upon request. Gratuity included with the $40. Also, one minor bother is that there are only 3 restroom stalls and I found myself waiting in line a few times when I could have spent my time eating some more of that delicious cheese Ravioli !! Regarding the service, it was very attentive and my empty plates weren't stacked up for long. Servers were constantly cleaning up and removing the plates that were in the way. 

I would eat here again to try the remaining that my full tummy couldn't take anymore. Overall, the food is satisfying and my dear Ravioli , i hope to taste you again.",3,2,2

Well yessir I will, and I heard that the Buffet at the Bellagio is the most popular and best one!

Heres what I was expecting. A large dinner buffet with many options including different cuts of meat, fresh seafood.

So onward we go, as we waited in line at 9pm. I wasn't expecting a crowd of people to be in line, and there really wasn't that many people. I think we waited for about 15-20mins before we paid for our dinner, then another 5-7mins until we were taken to our table by the nice waitress and were seated. 

First thing I noticed was that the soft drinks\/water are all self-serve, using the cool new soft drink dispenser you see at all major fast food burger joints now. Alcohol is not included in the price of the buffet, just in case you're wondering for all you lushes out there.

As usual, I take a preview walk of the options before I start piling my plate, and I started to realize...there aren't that many options. 

My first plate with mashed potatoes, a cut of the prime rib, some fried rice, dungeoness crab legs and some cocktail shrimp.

Second plate - Large copious amounts of snow crab legs, a pork of some kind that I can't remember, and some sushi.

All of the food I can say, is pretty average to below average. The snow crab legs were overly cooked and salty, the sushi was dry and boring, and there weren't as many options as I was expecting. I think the biggest problem, and all large buffets like this suffers from, is that theres too many options and some food tend to sit there and wait for the newest overeater to come by and pick them up.

This is especially the case of the dessert, which had at least 15 options not including the self-serve ice cream. All the desserts I sampled were just either too dry because they've been sitting out for too long, or are overly too sweet, which I guess is my personal preference.

Would I go back again? Probably not, especially not at the cost of $40+ per person. But if you're new to Vegas, I say, why not, give it a shot and form your opinion. I think I rather hit up David Chang's new Momofuku location or the Shake Shack thats not too far from the Bellagio.

Or just spend the $40 on black and see how your chances stack up.",1,1,2

There was loud crashing and clanking of dishes and dinnerware that reverberated off the walls and it absolutely ruined the meal. It really doesn't matter the quality of the food when you have these sounds piercing your eardrum as you are trying to chew.

I tried out the breakfast buffet which is a good deal for $15.95. A lot to choose from here. This include your typical bakery favorites like muffins and croissants, alongside sweet dessert items, fruit, oatmeal and cereals for those with a lighter appetite. 

For those of you with a bigger one, there is a lot to choose from here. They had your typical breakfast favorites like sausages (regular and chorizo), bacon, eggs, waffles and pancakes. But they do also have extra things like an omelet bar. They even had a Chinese selection for those preferring more ethnic cuisine. Also nice was the selection of breakfast pizzas offered. I thoroughly enjoyed each item I tried here.

If you are in no rush to get up, I would suggest hitting up this buffet a little later, say around 10 am. This way, you will be able to enjoy breakfast and also try some of the things on the lunch menu!

Salad was decently good.  Gotta be adventurous with the many selections of non-traditional dressings.  Lobster ravioli was excellent.  4 cheese pizza was also great.

I personally would recommend the roasted chicken (melts in your mouth), and of all things, the sliders (both the beef and the turkey)!

TIP: If you gamble enough, use your MGM player's card at the register to get your meal partially\/fully comped.

The brunch foods, such as pancakes, waffles, honey-glazed bacon, and other items were dissapointing. It seriously just fills you up..nothing more. We were fortunate enough to eat the crab legs..but unlike what all the previous reviews stated, I thought these crab legs were HORRID. They were terribly salty..either someone in the kitchen spilled a jar of salt in the water or an overworked employee was sweating all over this mess.

The selection of items on the Bellagio Buffet is wonderful. There's a little something there for everyone. The staff does a great job of keeping items fresh and well stocked. I would have to say this is one of my top picks when it comes to Vegas buffets and after this last stay ... I think I've officially tried them all! 

If you love crab legs as much as I do, then you're in luck.  They pile them high and let you serve yourself (unlike MGM).  It works out wonderfully, because you don't get caught waiting in line for an hour to receive three crab legs.  They slice them down the middle as well, which is another huge perk.  If you like them warm take them to one of the cooking stations and they will grill'em up for you.  It's Fantastic!

P.S. A Thrifty side note: If you time it just right - and hit the buffet line around 3:30 you will experience dinner selections at lunch prices $. Too, this will be the only meal you'd need for the day. Trust me. There is a way to do Vegas on a budget.",2,1,2

What a joke.  My friend had a players card that had $300 comp for food and drinks so we came here for dinner for that reason.  I felt bad for the people who did not have the Mlife players card because the line was stupid long and the wait was an hour (It was a Sunday night).  

We came in and I basically tried everything.  All the fishes were so dry.  The steak was dry.  And basically all their cakes were dry.  Their seafood was also not good.  I did however liked that they had already opened crab legs for you.  However, they kept running out and would not restock.  Their sushi was terrible.  Sushi rice was also dry.  They had a lot of dessert, but none were very appealing.  Their cheese cake, tasted like cheese cake flavored gelatin.  Nasty.  The only dessert that was alright was the creme brulee.  To sum it up, their food reminds me of one of those low-quality Chinese buffets.  It had those types of desserts.  

As for customer service, they were awesome.  Staff is very friendly and quick.  However, as for food, anyone that say this is the best buffet is an idiot.  $36.95 per person is definitely not worth it.  Glad we did not pay a buck or wait.

First off, total price paid for 2 adults including tax= $54.05 (My visit was around 1:00 PM on a Tuesday). There was no wait, yet the buffet itself was pretty slammed.
 SERVICE- What gave this place huge props to begin with was the service. As a ""tourist"", figuring out what you need to do from place to place without feeling or looking like a moron is sometimes frustrating. Communication from the employees were superb. They told us what to do, where to go, and what to expect without us even asking. This was THE ONLY restaurant that did this. Our drinks were never empty- again, the only place so far to accomplish this and our waitress truly made us feel as if we were receiving VIP treatment.
FOOD- I will rave for the rest of my life on the unbelievable flank steak we could cut with our forks. Most restaurants we visit, my husband always comments ""yours is way better"". But not this time. The comments from him were more ""you should totally figure out how to make this!"" If there was a food I could be negative on, it would be the breakfast sausage. They were huge and very juicy but they surprisingly didn't have much flavor. My husbands eyes rolled in the back of his head when tasting the corn chowder... he said the only thing he wished they had that they didn't was corn bread to accompany this amazingness! and whoever reported negative feedback on the sushi, I have been to SEVERAL upscale and top rated sushi restaurants and found these to be surprisingly awesome especially for a buffet. Definitely nothing to complain about. Last to report are the desserts.... I am probably the biggest critique in the world in this department and will say I was extremely pleased to see the biggest selection (out of all the buffets) offering sugar free dessert selections. My husband is diabetic and was able to feel normal again here. Again, if I had to complain, it would be that they put some of the desserts on plates which made it harder to be a big pig in one trip! Beautifully presented and perfectly flavored in every way.
WHAT TO EXPECT- Extremely clean, fresh food with unbelievable service, and overall impressive bang for the buck! Not to mention, the only buffet that gave us REAL linen napkins! Very impressed. Good Job Bellagio!!!",0,0,0

Parking: easy multi-level parking structure or complimentary valet parking

Description: This had been the buffet that other buffets have had to measure themselves against.  Even though it is out-shined by Bacchanal currently, it still remains one of the best buffets in Las Vegas.  Seafood is important at buffets.  It boasts a selection of Alaskan King Crab, Snow Crabs and peeled medium-large shrimp along with cooked fish like halibut, salmon, sea bass etc.  It has some cooked mussels, but no oysters or scallops.  It has an excellent carving station too.  See the highlights below:

Highlights:
--Alaskan King Crab Legs (dinner)--cut in half, perhaps a little salty but still good
--Snow Crab Legs--cut in half, nice and sweet
--Peeled Shrimp--nicely cooked, good texture
--Caviar (three types served on little waffles)--not available at other buffets 
--Beef Wellington (dinner)--not at any other buffet in LV (had beef wellington at the Al Qasr buffet in Dubai), used to have Chicken Wellington for lunch but not anymore :(
--Kobe beef (dinner)--not seasoned well
--Rack of lamb (dinner)--seasoned well, I could eat them all day but I had to save some calories
--Venison (dinner)--flavorful 
--Goose (dinner)--a bit overcooked
--Quail (dinner)--perfect
--Prime Rib--good but I didn't want to waste anymore calories finishing it
--Turkey--never a fan of turkey
--Ham (breakfast)--regular
--Asian dishes: bbq pork buns, shumai, mee fen, fried rice, some stir fried dishes 
--multiple types of sausage and cooked meats
--multiple types of pizza--hawaiian, vegetable, pepperoni, sausage, bbq chicken, shrimp and pesto, etc
--multiple types of pasta--ravioli, gnocchi, penne, tortellini, etc and rice dishes like risotto and paella for example
--breakfast items: scrambled eggs, omelettes cooked to order, eggs benedict, pancakes to order, belgian waffles (red velvet and regular), apple crepes, potatoes, muffins, different breads, etc
--multiple side dishes--vegetables and different potatoes (mashed, sweet potato, pesto potatoes, etc)
--small assortment of sushi--only a few types, some hand sushi available
--salads made to order or already mixed
--breads and soups
--dessert: macaroons (excellent like from a specialty store only selling macaroons)--they go fast and are not replenished once they are gone, cheesecake, carrot cake, mousse cakes, fruit tarts, lime tarts, sugar free pies, gluten free cakes, bread pudding, soft-serve yogurt
--regular drinks included but also gives you the option of all you can drink wine, sparkline wine and beer at a premium

Service: excellent, fast, friendly, waiters refill drinks and remove dirty plates frequently

Quality: high quality, but some dishes have been removed over time like chicken wellington at lunch, creme brulee, large fruit tarts etc, need multi-flavored gelato to keep up with Cosmopolitan Wicked Spoon and Caesar's Palace Bacchanal

Environment: expect to wait 30-45 minutes depending on the day and\/or holiday season, noisy, family friendly, can accommodate large parties

Value: excellent (used to be outstanding but over time it has declined a bit and the prices have gone up--there used to be two areas for the cold seafood (combined crab legs with shrimp) precluding super long lines, now only one area for shrimp and one area for crab legs, thereby creating a long line in the seafood section, chicken wellington has been removed from brunch\/lunch, creme brulee is no longer present

The servers were actually rude and we had not experienced that at any other restaurant in Vegas.
On one occasion, a short woman was shouting across the restaurant (above customer's heads) to other employees. She appeared to be a supervisor. It was quite a spectacle as everyone in that section of the restaurant had slowed down their eating to watch. This was so inappropriate. 
After she had left the area, I waited until our server walked by and I asked him if she was the floor manager. He said that he didn't know who I was talking about.

 We have been here before. We wanted to try Caesar's buffet but the line is so darn long :\/ plus our fault for going for dinner after 9 not knowing buffets close so early. So this particular night it was no different. Got here at 9, waited a good 20 minutes, panicking that we would get old food. They reassured us that they will serve past 10. It's not cheap that we can just blow away $ and eat old food. This will be the only buffet we will hit just the 2 of us sans kids and we can finally eat in peace and enjoy it. But our fault for coming so late. 
With that said. We liked their selection. First saw the crab legs but if you go down more, there are different kinds of crab legs, better ones by the salad area! Ahh. They were good, fresh, cracked and really good with butter. Their cocktail shrimp and lamb chop was good too. Their sushi was fresh. 
There wasn't much time to dally trying other useless typical buffet stuff and frankly their Asian cuisine n won ton soup wasn't good at all but that's ok. Came here for seafood. 
I remember their desserts were divine last time we came but bc of the late hour, there wasn't much selection left. Their flan was good, the last one we were lucky to get. Otherwise rest was so so. 
Yeah I do wish they have gelato instead of the soft serve. :\/ Strange that they don't. 

Our server was a nice Asian lady n very kind and stopped by alot. Told us when to do the last calls and patient with us coming in so late. 

Just personally wish we had more time to enjoy our food instead of rushing and scarving it all down.

Did like the fact, unlimited beverages came with it and coffee too. 

Overall, enjoyed it. Crab legs were the best. If it wasn't for M Resorts' buffet featuring their divine sashimi salad, I would come back here next time :)",1,0,0

I ate here about three days after getting back from my first trip to India.  After six months of finding God in the Ganges, I chose to make the terrible mistake of taking my blissfully post-ashram enlightened butt to an expensive buffet in Vegas.  Hell-o Culture Shock.

It starts out with a long line.  I was used to this, put people here actually make a line.  I has already ready to yell at someone for jumping the line, but no such American luck.  People scrambled like hungry busy bees to get as much food on the tables as possible.  

Mind you, the table for two at this establishment was, at a normal restaurant, a table for four.  I was with two other people, so our table was a sixer.  Our cokes were Oktoberfest size.  

I walked around and saw a couple with what looked like a mountain of crab legs, maybe 6-7 plates full.  Gross.   I did manage to try a little of this and that.  Not memorable as far as quality of food goes.  I couldn't help but watch the train wreck of mass consumption.

The group I was with were looking for the right combination of a good buffet and a reasonable price. The Buffet at Bellagio, based on a few online reviews I read, seemed to meet those requirements,

Then I walked in.

First of all, they charged me a $47 ""holiday rate"" because of Columbus Day weekend. Columbus Day is a horrible holiday for many historical reasons in my view, but that aside, I was there in a Friday. Columbus Day was on the following Monday. Why would they gouge customers for $47 three days before a random holiday? 

Anyway, that wasn't a good start to the experience. But I want to review this place irrespective of those shenanigans and provide an unbiased assessment.

The food was decent and diverse. They had a couple meat stations - one which was serving prime rib and corned beef, and another which was serving goat shanks and lamb chops. The corned beef was really flavorable as was the lamb shanks. Those who tried the other options had a similar assessment.

They had a few seafood stations, one which had shrimp cocktails, another with several different types of crab legs, and a sushi station. The crab legs were sliced in half vertically, making it easy to eat. The shrimp was okay. The sushi was underwhelming (especially the sashimi). 

They had a pizza station which was pretty good. They had a few different kinds of thin-crust pizza, and I appreciated that.

Everything else, for the most part, was pretty ""meh"" for a buffet - nothing better than you'd have in your average buffet in other parts of the country. 

The one thing I will offer specific praise for is the dessert section. They had several different options - cheesecakes, brownies, flan, cookies, creme brulee, ice cream, etc. After trying a bite of a few different options, I can say that they were all good except for the flan.

Ultimately, when factoring in even the regular, non-holiday rate, I'd say that it isn't worth the price when there are several better dining options nearby. It's definitely not worth $47. Ridiculous.",1,0,0

There are still a few nice items, such as the broccolini, sea bass, and paella, shrimp cocktail, and crab legs.

Like most have said, Bellagio used to be good but I guess something happened? Well, the crab legs sucked when I compare it to my recent dine in experience at Mandalay Bay's Buffet and the food was only average. There were only a few things I could think of that Bellagio's buffet was good for this time around: their Shrimp, sushi, (brazil?) snow fish, and yea...their desert line.

I was in Vegas with my lady and decided that I wanted to eat one night at a nice buffet on the strip. I have tried many, including the ones at the Rio, Luxor, Ecalibur, and MGM so I went online and Goggled top Las Vegas Buffets. Many lists ranked the Bellagio as numero uno so I decided to give it a try. I admit they had some good dishes, but far from being number 1 in my opinion. 

I am going to do the math so everyone can see how I got to my 3 star rating. 

Bad: 

1. Crab legs were extremely dry and salty. 
2. Asian food had very few choices and the sushi tasted no better then grocery store deli sushi. 
3. Specialty salads had to be served by a person and came in little bowls, so really hard to sample all of them. 
4. Over all selections of food was small, unusual for a large buffet. 
5. Most importantly EVERYTHING WAS SALTY!!!!!! 

Good: 

1. Service was very good. 
2. Other then the saltiness of it you could tell the the food was high quality. Not opened from a can or jar. I tried some Asian noodles that were some of the best I had had. 
3. The crab legs were already cracked!!!!! Wow that was a huge plus, made it easier to eat them when you didn't have to work.....just sad that they were so salty and dry. 
4. A major plus that helped get this place back to 3 stars was the deserts. Very good selection and they were awesome. I almost at one point thought that they were good enough to come one night and just eat sweets. 

With all of that said, will I return....no, I am sure there are much better places out there to try. Next I will try the Wynn.",0,0,0

The 2 stars is for my recent Memorial day weekend trip where Bellagio raised the price for weekend buffet to $47.99.   We had a chiid and paid $50 for her as well.  At 6pm, there was literally NO ONE in line.  I was thinking, ok, it's still early especially in Vegas.  Got to the counter and said, wow, no line.  The cashier said, maybe it's because we raised our price for the weekend (No Kidding!!).

Food wise - normal everyday selection.  Nothing special.  I mean at least tease us with fresh oysters or something wild???? NO! it was only bbq ribs and roasted chicken! Everything else (King Crab legs, prime ribs, lamb chops) you can get any other day.

You can expect the usual buffet stations: Meat carving station, seafood, salads, Italian, Asian, American, and dessert. I made second trips to the Asian section, which offers Chinese broccoli, vegetarian chow mein, and shumai. Dessert was primarily breakfast pastries, with a sprinkling of cheesecakes, brownies, cookies, and cakes here and there. Sugar-free and gluten-free options are available, which is terrific if for those with dietary restrictions; however, they could've been better. The gluten-free brownie I had was somewhat dense, and the sugar-free lemon cheesecake had a distinct artificial flavor.

We expected the good news to be Ostrich steaks, Elk roast, Venison and many other excellent foods that we have previously enjoyed only at the Bellagio.

When we arrived at the buffet we were surprised to find no line at all.  The price turned out to be even higher than we expected, that was off putting.  We paid, went in and grabbed our plates.

Meal Highlights
 - prime rib
 - thick cut glazed bacon

 - all you can drink champagne

Champagne was cheap (just an additional $5), and they give you all the OJ you want to make your own mimosas. 

Sadly I didn't get the chance to eat the cool items that other people had like Beef Wellington. Hence the lower rating since there was nothing that really piqued my interest. 

All items mentioned above were executed well. I'm a sucker for thick cut bacon and the slice I had was almost pure fat. awesome! But all the other items were just ok and left me feeling that I could get better from the local restaurants in Sacramento.

The pasta dishes were probably my favorite part, with a good variety of filled and long pastas in creative sauces and presentations.  The dessert pastries were also good, but no better than you'd find in any mid-range buffet.  Finally, the biggest disappointment: a soft-serve ice cream dispenser.

Just like the way it is mandatory for me to sit down to a good game of Blackjack when I am in Vegas...chowin' down at an all-you-can-gorge buffet is also a must-do on the Sin City itinerary.

Since I was of pre-gambling age, the Bellagio has reigned supreme as ""the"" buffet to eat at.  With their vast array of seafood, carved meats, entrees, and desserts...It has always been gluttony at its best...That is until now.

Our most recent chow-down at the Bellagio was somewhat less-than-spectacular.  Somehow they seemed to have cut down on there seafood offerings.  Shrimp cocktail is still offered, but not a single Alasakan king crab leg was in sight when we went for Sunday brunch.  Entree selections are plentiful...but nothing was too special.  Desserts have also gotten quite mundane.  Overall experience was a 3.5 STARS.

In comparison to our recent experience at the Wynn, we have to say that ""the"" premiere Vegas buffet is now ""The Buffet"" at Wynn.  Until Bellagio tunes up its buffet...our money and appetites will be resting with the Wynn.",2,1,1

Here is the low-down: pre-split king crab legs and a pot of clarified butter, along with the finest chocolatey desserts ever found in a buffet, paired up with delicious angus roast beef and sushi-grade tuna\/salmon and roast duck and quail and everything else you would ever want from a buffet. 

The kicker: $30. And its at the Bellagio, so you won't feel like you're a cheapass for going to a buffet instead of a pricey 5-star joint. Need more proof that its good? How many other buffets have a snaking line in front of them? The 20 minute wait is absolutely worth it, and everyone in that line knows it, so just join them and wait for the glory.

The dinner time starts @4p which on Sundays the price is $29.99.  So we got in line and hoping it wasn't too long of a wait cuz we were hoping to pay for the lunch price which was $5 less. ....and so we did!  The downfall to what he had to pay is if there is a party of 8 + means you are automatically charged 18% gratuity.  (To my opinion gratuity is earned and not to be expected but that's another subject)

The ambiance was quite disappointing for me...the place looked dated and really needs an update.  It had a lot of dark colors and just looked dreary.  

So I make my rounds and look around first to see what they had.  When I go to a buffet...I like to just take maybe half a spoon of something that I am interested in just to taste it and not waste it if it's yuk.  I started off with the prime rib and had them grill it a bit since it looked like it was still alive.  The aujus was very runny and the prime rib was very chewy.  Quite disappointing to me.  The taste...the taste is what you expect it to be.  But definitely not ""melt in your mouth"" as one yelper exclaimed.
The seaweed salad was good but how can you mess that up.  Sushi...ehh...and not much selection as far as sushi goes.  Calamari was like eating white fat rubber bands like the ones that holds the broccoli together at your grocery store. --lol.  Roasted potato was ok. 

They were in the midst of changing the food selection to dinner foods which what we were all waiting for.  The next plate was mostly crab legs.  Too frozen and already split in half which I would rather open up myself and be able to enjoy a whole piece out of the leg.  The pastas were good.  Nothing spectacular and the Chinese Pork bun was good. 

Desserts was nothing to be amazed by.  Flan was flan...the desserts in the shot glasses- panna cotta, some mousse coffee thing, -was kinda runny but good.  The carrot cake was moist and the coffee was your average tasting coffee.  

Our server....no it was not his fault but come on...if you know you are getting almost $5 each from us from the 'mandatory' gratuity...I would expect our drinks to be constantly filled and NO- there was not any real steak knives to cut the prime rib.  We were expected to cut the meat with our generic knives that came with the table.  -and yes I asked the server for a real steak knife and he looked at me like I asked for something personal.  Geez.

Even the hot tea (I always ask for that with my meal)--I did not get a lemon nor honey with my tea.  

Would I go here again?  NO
Would I recommend the place to others?  ONLY TO EXPERIENCE THE ""BELLAGIO BUFFET"" ITSELF.

So far my favorite right now is The M Resort Studio B Buffet.  Yes they have raised the price...but I would say the overall experience at the M is worth it.

It has always been the place to eat for me and my family when it comes to buffets in Las Vegas.  I brought my fiance here during our recent vacation over Labor Day weekend and it did not disappoint.  The wait was not too bad, maybe 30 minutes at 7pm on the Friday night.  I wasn't happy that they marked up the price only because it was a holiday weekend, nothing changed with the buffet that I noticed.

Overall, the quality of the food was great, of course like with every buffet there are hits and misses.  One disappointment was their kobe beef.  Whenever you see kobe beef you think high quality meat that will melt in your mouth, well this kobe steak they advertised was grossly dry, and the slice I got was rare too!   They did have this skirt steak though, marinated in some great sauce with seasoning that was so tender, excellently prepared!  The rack of lamb was ok, had a lot of rosemary taste to it which was pleasant.  The peking duck surprisngly was very tasty.  At first we were both skeptical about the duck because the chef there didn't even seem to know how to chop it!  

And of course, what we came for was perfect.  The prime rib was so rare and so tender, and well seasoned for taste.  The king crab legs, oh gosh, excellent!!  Makes me wonder why they even serve snow crab for.  Oh speaking of which, I was on my way back with dessert when I saw this guy, with a huge pile of snow crab legs, he saw the king crab legs and said something to his wife, and dumped all the snow crab back onto the pile and began hoarding king crab legs, so bad!

The desserts were just ok here, the creme brulee was decent, the flan was just ok, fruit tart was tasty.

Overall, I would have give this place a 5 star rating based on the prime rib, shrimp cocktail, and king crab legs alone as these are some of the best I have ever had at any buffet.  However due to the misses and lackluster dessert and mark up of the price with nothing extra special to show for it, I will have to give it a 4 star rating.  Still, I would come back every time I am in town for just the prime rib and king crab alone!

Wait staff: like most buffets, they come around and clean your empty plates, fill you drinks and answer any other questions you might have. So I wouldn't say they are the most friendliest since they are running around like mad. Our waitress was nice though.

Food: Well, this is were the review really goes down hill. The steaks tasted like poor cuts of meat or if the meat going bad. It was not tender. We tried the prime rib. This was not too bad. everything else was either bland, tasteless or dried out. One of my friends resorted to eating cookies and drinking milk to fill up.
The King crab legs were not very fresh tasting either.
The Bok Choy had bits of sand \/ sediment still lodged in its leaf. 
While we were there, at least 7-8 tables of people left within 10-15 mins of sitting down due to the disappointment of the buffet. 
I am truly sorry I could not give it more than 1 start for such a beautiful Hotel\/Casino. Maybe it was an off day for the start or maybe they had food issues that transferred to our meal.

I highly doubt I will go back to give them a 2nd chance when there are other buffets in Vegas to try.

Price: At about $35 a person, its very expensive when you consider the quality of the meal

Overall: My advice is beware, it may not be as good as everyone touts it to be. Since you are in Vegas, you Will be taking a gamble on whether it will be good or not.

But the breakfast at the Bellagio buffet was freaking amazing!!  So you ask, what is up with the do-over request?  You see, although everything was amazing, it was nothing compared to the little chunks of steak (add eggs on top if you wish) I found on the hot line.  At first, I was hesitant b\/c small steak pieces usually mean dry or overdone steak.  Not here...this was probably the softest, most tender, perfectly medium-rare cubes of steak I have ever consumed!

On top of that, they probably have the freshest selection of fruit out.  So my do-over would include bowls of their fresh berries (blueberry, raspberry, strawberry) and lots of red meat.  For those 2 items at the Bellagio buffet, I would be willing to sacrifice all the other amazing buffet items they had to offer!

DESSERT TIP:  We went at 10am and got the cusp of end of breakfast and start of lunch (which begins at 11am).  The buffet is open non-stop all day, so by 10:45am, they start weening down the b-fast items and lining up their lunch items, starting with dessert.

i was thoroughly surprised by bellagio because i've heard mixed reviews from friends. i think this buffet rivals rio as my favorite...mMm good selection of food! their pasta is actually GOOD, not just a pan full of generic, unflavored sauce and noodles. lobster ravioli..mMm!! 

also, the crab legs weren't as great as the ones i've had at the wynn..i DO like that they cut it open for you so you're not picking and snapping at it, but the crab meat just wasn't sweet as i'd like. oh and the bacon! hahah who goes to buffets and gets bacon? yes, i do. such delicious, crispy bacon. i wish i could have a side of bacon with all my meals. 

also, like the advice of the others, going around 3-4 is the best because you get dinner selections for lunch prices! the kebabs were delicious and smelled sooo good..my mouth watered watching the cooks grill them. i usually don't like prime rib, but i loved the prime rib here -- although their au jus that day was SUPER SALTY. =( also, don't skip out on the chicken noodle soup --- it's good! big egg noodles, big chunks of chicken...not your average campbell's soup. 

and dessert of course!  the fruits were fresh and you could see them cutting it right then and there! there's a machine with peach and raspberry sorbet -- it's so creamy and a bit tart. i couldn't stop eating the chocolate\/white choco covered strawberries, and the creme brulee! i usually only eat the top, crispy burnt part of the creme brulee, but this custard was actually good! 

this was definitely worth the wait and i left stuffed and satisfied!",0,0,0

All of the staff working the place were very efficient and polite.
For $38, there was nothing special here whatsoever.

Prime Rib was very, very dry and no flavor at all.
Corned beef, good but again very dry.
Dry turkey and dry rotisserie chicken.  (I see a trend here).

Salad bar was ok.  Several different toppings and dressings, nothing that I haven't seen at any other salad bar.
Italian area.  Several pastas and pizzas.  Beef ravioli's were just OK.  Cavatelli with sun-dried tomatoes and gorgonzola cheese was good.
Asian area.  Boring.  Good chicken shu mai, terrible looking chow-mein.
Taco bar was seriously lacking, each time we walked by nobody was even working it.
The one time a guy was working it, he was unloading tortillas out of plastic bags. 
Seafood area.  Cold crab legs, cold shrimp and Jonah claws.  WHY?  Why not steamed.  BORING this way.  Come on!

Then there is another salad bar, not sure why it is in a different area, this one has prepared salads.  Caesar was pretty good.  Grapefruit, kale and pine nut salad was interesting and good.  The best thing here was the poke, which I have never seen at a buffet before.
Why the sushi was over here and not by the Asian food???? Not sure but really out of place.
Here, next to the sushi you will find the cheese, good assortment, no meats.  Oh, and then the breads are on the other side of the room.  Weird arrangements.

Desserts were nothing at all to wow about.  Puddings, tarts, cookies and OOOOHHHH soft serve ice cream direct from Golden Corral.  No gelato, no strawberries, no creme brulee, no tira misu.  Where is the good stuff that everyone is so ""wow"" about?

No alcohol included.  Wine is $14 more per glass.

Sadly only meat ravioli in a mushroom cream sauce was blah and cheese tortellini tasted like chef boy r d.  The ceaser salad was not even close to ceaser. It was like watered down creamy Italian dressing.  
Plenty of delicious big yummy shrimp cocktail for all along with crab legs sliced with a band saw for easier eating.  The prime rib from the carving station sat on the plate untouched after one bite. Tasteless and tough.

I heard great reviews about this place, but the day we came in (I'm not sure if it's because we came for lunch) the selection was really disappointing. Plus there was this stench around the soup area, I'm not sure if it were the workers or just the place wasn't squeaky clean; but it was very off putting every time I walk pass. There were scrambled eggs still during lunch. Then there was chicken rotisserie style next door to it (I was a little thrown off). The pineapple fried rice was pretty good (one of the better ones, but I've had better). The dessert selection was a little whack, they had eclairs, but chocolate filled?? Eugh. Waaay too sweet, the other cakes were alright; still over baringly sweet. The only one that was good was is the carrot cake. Oh don't get me started on the coffee, ITS VEGAS RIGHT?? So of course this was the first meal of MY day because I had slept in from the previous night of fun, so I have to order my coffee on the daily. The coffee was boring, not strong enough; and no coffee taste (I hope the morning roast was better). I really wanted to like this place, but it didn't turn out that way :\/",0,1,0

I have been to a lot of buffets in my short life and this buffet has to be one of my top buffets . Places like Caesars Palace have a big price tag and a very fancy set up , but most of their food is very mediocre . Of course this place serves your tradition crab legs ( always good ) and prime rib ( above average ) . In addition you can get sushi , sashimi , and handrolls along with caviar , steak tartar , or wagyu beef . The dessert is quality too . The only reason why I say his buffet is worth the $40 price tag is because it serves expensive food that you usually don't get in one sitting . Come early to beat the food rush .

However, the king crab legs were DELICIOUS!!! So tender and fresh hehe. This alone is worth it if you enjoy seafood. They also had crawfish (went on a Thursday).

Everything tasted amazing and even with a  packed restaurant, the food still overflowed and were replenished quickly.

This didn't ruin the greatness of the Buffet, but:
(1) The crab was overly salty. As if you were licking a salt stick. 
(2) And the employee carving the prime rib on the night I was at the restaurant was a bit moody and was upset if you asked your prime rib to be cooked a bit longer. He tried to shove the prime rib on my plate and kept gesturing me to take it, even though I asked 3 times to get it well done. He had 2 other prime rib pieces on the grill in back and I guess he was just annoyed that we all wanted our meat cooked longer (not rare).

It was a dinner only dessert and only on Friday and Saturday when it was more expensive. It was a tart mango puree with a blueberry, a blackberry and a raspberry inside - one of each berry. It came in a small alcohol glass and was topped with torched meringue. During the premium dinner buffet the other desserts were similar only perhaps a few were dusted with a bit of edible gold. These days the cost cutting department seem to be a heavy influence, but this place is still as classy as buffets get. Ive looked at Palios and Palio Pronto for my favorite mango dessert - its nowhere. Trust me I've been looking for it for 10 years. I love this place even if without my mango dessert.

Their selection is so great, you'll burn some cal's walking around looking for items to fill your plate. There's a vast array of cuisines from a multitude of different cultures that are all prepared well and presented nicely.

I had been to Vegas 10 years ago and was not able to try any of the buffets so hitting one was a must this go around. I did some research and found out that Bally's and Bellagio had the best.

I liked the mini Belgian waffles, allowed you to try them without filling up on them. I ordered a Bloody Mary also, and found it very different, had, what I estimate, to be a chipotle type pepper in it due to the fact that I detected a pleasant smokey flavor on top of the spiciness.

Being honest, I'm no buffet connoisseur. I'm actually pretty easy to please at buffets as I go straight for the crab legs and fill up on delicious seafood meat. Bellagio Buffet does have a lot to offer, however, and is an excellent overall buffet dining choice.

It's quite popular so there's usually a wait if you go for dinner during the weekend or even weekdays. I imagine the wait can be 30+ minutes during prime dinner time. Buffet size is huge with more than enough seating and there's a nice layout of a variety of hot and cold food stations.

Everything you typically imagine at a buffet is available. Italian, American, Asian, Seafood - you name it! Pastas, salads, chicken, steak, prime rib, veggies, steamed clams, mussels, sushi, soup,  BBQ ribs, pizza, sausage... (just to name the most random dishes I could recall at the top of my head) Even the pickiest of eaters could find and fill up on something they enjoy. The difference at this buffet compared to others would honestly be the quality of the food and the taste. The food items never seem to run low either which is always important. Myself, I am the biggest fan of their crab legs and seafood!

- Snow Crab Legs for dinner (cut in halves)
- King Crab Legs available doing their weekend Gourmet dinner (my fav)
- Stone Crab Legs (pre-cracked) 
- Shrimp cocktail for days (yum!)

They also have a station I favor with sushi rolls, nigiri, and poke. I absolutely love their salmon and tuna poke - the marinade is flavorful and the fish is extremely fresh! A must try for sushi lovers!! They also have a sever working behind the sushi bar who whips up made to order hand rolls and steak tartare delights. Definitely take advantage and indulge in the steak tartare... So. Good.

What I also appreciate at this buffet is their service. They never seem short staffed and their servers are all very friendly and accommodating. The last time I visited, a server even pulled up an extra chair to place my purse on. It really wasn't necessary but a very nice gesture!

Pricing:
- Breakfast (Mon - Fri, 7A - 11A): $23.99
- Lunch (Mon - Fri, 11A - 3P): $27.99

After checking out some of the restaurants, the accountant in me thought, why don't we pay few bucks more and go to an all you can eat buffet??

There was a little bit of a line when we got there on Tuesday morning, but the line moved pretty quickly and we only had to wait about 15 minutes.  

I had thought there was going to be crab here, but unfortunately there was none. (For also the same price at the Aria buffet, you can get crab so I was disappointed by this.)  So, I tried other things,  one of the main things that I enjoyed was prime rib.  I usually do not like meat that is so rare, but this was so tender and delicious.  Dip it in the au jous sauce they have in front of the carving station and it make it so much better.  Aside from the prime rib, I did not really care for anything else.  I tried the pasta, sushi, pizza, and a few other things, which I did not think was bad but not great.  I also tried some of their dessert, which I thought tasted a little too sweet (I know, it's dessert, but I almost thought it was sugar overload).

My wife and I have made it a tradition over the past 7 years to eat at this Buffet each time we go to Vegas.  The name and decor is timeless in my opinion.  Even as old as the Bellagio is, this place is classic and has maintained an unbelievable level of upkeep.  We enjoy the robust selection of items available each time we go to this Buffet.  They really do a great job and we've NEVER EVER had problems.  This buffet is definitely one of the more expensive buffets on the strip and I believe it's still great value for what they provide.  

Usually, we do not eat Breakfast Buffets as we are always sleeping in.  However, this time, we ate the Breakfast Buffet due to a long drive back home.  I can honestly say, this breakfast buffet truly exonerated what it means that Breakfast is the best meal of the day.  If you're up early enough for breakfast and want a buffet, the Bellagio is a must.

My one negative is that they only have one bathroom stall.  I had to wait over 10 minutes, because some jackazz was smoking in there.  I did not realize that until I went to use the bathroom, because otherwise I would have told someone.  They really only have the bathrooms there for convenience, because they want to control who leaves and exits the dining area.  They really need to install another stall or maybe a separate restroom.",2,2,1

Came here on the day after labor day and didn't expect that we still have to get in line and wait for about 30 mins to be seated. 

I had Wynn Buffet the day before and I came here with HIGH exceptions but truly disappointed.

-1 we were being seated nearby the buffet entrance, which means, people standing in line were watching us the WHOLE TIME during eating, giving us a lot of pressure and it was def unpleasant. The restaurant was pretty packed on a Tuesday night and tables were so close to each others. This totally made me feel like we were dining at a hometown buffet; loud, crowded, and poor food quality.

-1 I thought buffet at Bellagio would be same level (or higher) than Wynn's, since I have done my homework, reading all the reviews on Yelp before deciding to go to Bellagio. I was wrong! Food was not good at all, prime rib was so so, and the Kobe beef steak they offered was so dry and it tastes like jerky. Sushi looks bad, I didn't even bother to try it. The tuna they offered don't look fresh to me, ahi poke looked like it has been in the fridge for at least few days. Chinese section offered some panda express style Chinese food, bleh, who wants to eat that? I tried the chow mein and it was so salty n spicy (tasted like they put tons of chili sauce to stir fried it) Cheese tasted like some cheapies from supermarket, soup tasted like canned soup. The only good tasty thing I ate throughout the whole night was the asparagus. 

-1 I gave one last try in the dessert, blah - not good, nothing special to write about. No decent dessert like Wynn.The cream brulee is prob the WORST I've ever tasted. They didn't put enough sugar onto the custard and didn't caramelize it under a broilerI So it wasn't really a cream brulee, more like an egg custard with some caramel sauce floating in it. 

+ 1 service was great! The only plus of the night was our waiter. He was very attentive and friendly. He came back very often to clean out plates and refill our drinks. We had two cokes and at the end of our meal he came by again to ask if we want coffee or tea. When he saw my bf reached into his pocket for his wallet he even told us not to rush and take our time to finish our food and coffee. 

I really don't understand the hype about this buffet. What's so great about it? I don't even think I will come back at all paying $30 per person for something like this, NEVER!",1,0,2

Second, you can't rate the quality of a buffet based solely on the fact that they have crab legs and prime rib, so minus one star there.  While crab legs are good, barely thawed crab legs out of an industrial bucket ""don't a good buffet make.""

After doing a little research on Yelp on the must-try buffets in Vegas, my friends and I hit up the Bellagio lunch buffet on a Saturday.  The only previous Vegas buffet experience I have to compare it to is the one at MGM Grand.

Bellagio...you did not disappoint!  There were quite a lot of options for me to choose from as a vegetarian.  Vegetarian sushi, two types of seaweed salad (I'm addicted to this stuff!), excellent pizza, herbed polenta, and prepared salads such as the heirloom tomato.  The penne pasta was excellent too since it was garnished with fresh basil.  I'm a sucker for it.

The dessert bar was beautiful.  My friend and I had fun taking photos of all the pastries.  We grabbed ALL of them and took them back to our table to share.  The 6 of us decided that the cheesecake garnished with blueberries was the winner.

One of my friends added on the unlimited champagne for an additional $5 to the tab but it was too early for me to start drinking.  The overall price for the lunch buffet is also about $5 cheaper than that of the Wynn's.  You can read my review on that too.

The one hour wait to try the food was definitely worth it.  I shall return!  Except next time I may bring along a wheel barrow so I can get carted out of there in my food coma state.",0,0,1

At 11am, there was not much of a line to get inside. I went for the unlimited champagne brunch, which cost about $30 -  only $6 more than the regular brunch.

My eyes are always much bigger than my stomach at buffets, but by now I've learned to work out a system that is the least wasteful. Check out all the food first, go for proteins and take small portions, stay away from carbs as much as possible, and then save the most room for dessert!

The food at the dinner buffet is definitely much better than brunch, but you also pay a lot more. Brunch is good, but nothing is really spectacular. The beef tenderloin, spicy tuna hand rolls with spicy sweet sauce, and leg of lamb were my favorites. The desserts were the best part - the cheesecake and carrot cake are delectable! 

My mimosa came in a large wine glass, which is smart on their end because they don't have to come around pouring as much. I actually only managed to drink one glass, which turned out to be just enough. If we had stayed there for a couple hours, I'm sure I would've had another glass or two.

Not that I haven't dined in places like this before in other major cities of the world but this is Vegas with all the frivolities one can be exposed to. This place gave me my earlier high-end taste to Vegas' gastronomic experiences on the buffet aspect of it.

Quality at its best with live action cooking by chefs done in their cooking stations. Cuisines popular to world palates of Italian, Asian, Seafood, American, Japanese, Chinese, French, with Soups, Salads, Beverages, Vegetables, and Desserts that are all prepared and presented in exquisite settings. Some of the food presentations seem like window shop decor. The dining room is spacious. Servers are hospitable and timely service. Of course, what comes with this is the median expense to this type of dining establishment. Nevertheless, you can be rest assured of a fabulous dining experience.

The dinner buffet I had was tremendously received well by me. Luckily, I had no wait in line. Was I early? Not. I guess, everyone got seated before me. I dined alone yet I never felt ""lonely"" in my table and seat. As I got a table and seating in the center of the dining room next to the bar, the bartender had me conversing with him from time to time. My food server was also attentive enough to take some of her time to speak with me. Both were attentive but not diverted in their attention to their other duties. Otherwise, even if their company was not sufficient, I had no feeling of being alone. Dining alone in the past is not a strange endeavor for me. Even if they haven't spoken to me, I was definitely entertained by the glorious meals I have chosen to have:  New England Clam Chowder, Creme Brulee, Vegetables, Bread Pudding, Rack of Lamb, Layered Chocolate Cake, Salmon Nigiri, Duck, Crab Legs, and Venison to name some I partaked on for my dinner. Vast array of desserts and pastries were dizzying to choose from. I didn't hesitate to grab a Capuccino Mousse to have for the last of all the dessert I had before it. A glass of red wine Merlot and white wine Pinot Grigio were my beverages of choice for both my meat and seafood tastes. To mention, chocolate-covered strawberries as one of my chosen ""appetizer"".

There are a few nice touches, but not to the level one expects of Bellagio.  One does expect high quality from Bellagio, and the food, for a buffet, is that.  At times, you can almost forget it's buffet food.  The real standouts are the desserts.  I normally don't eat buffet desserts.  They aren't worth the calories, often bad in taste and texture.  However, at the Bellagio, it's worth saving room.  The chocolate dome was very good.  The key lime pie was good.  My complaint would be that they don't have gelato (many other buffets now). 

Overall, it's one of the better buffets.  It kills Mirage which is mediocre, IMHO.  However, it's still buffet food.  And it's pricy.  If you're filling up on an omelet,  at over $30, that's a pricy egg omelet.

It's a tough score.  The food is 4 stars (for buffets), but the price and options is 3 stars.  Service was good (which, for me, is normal).  I'll lean towards a score of 4 bearing in mind the comparison is to other buffets in town -- not other restaurants.",0,0,0

Yeah, it was a good, solid buffet.  I didn't eat as much as I wanted to -- I think I just didn't pace myself very well.  But I think if I had been hungrier this would have been worth $20 for lunch.

From what I remember, the best items were:
- a mountain of shrimp cocktail (be careful not to take too many tho!  leave room for other things!)
- very decent steak
- ribs
- smoked salmon and scallops

Their Asian selection was pretty unimpressive looking (both the sushi and hot Asian Fusion sections) but, hey,  I didn't come to taste the delicacies of the world.  I came to engorge on meat and seafood and -- oh yeah, dessert!

The dessert section, sadly, didn't taste as good as it looked.  A couple of the items were pretty good but most were average or below average.  They had chocolate dipped strawberries but ran out before I could get any :(

I'd probably come back.  But next time, I want crab legs!!!

When you're stuck in traffic for 7 hours and all the buffets close at 10 pm...and the wait time is from 1 hour to two hours long...we got lucky with The Buffet at the Bellagio!

Salad bar:
-Didn't even see a shadow at this station. Of course, they have your typical stuff but since it's definitely not the focus for anyone...let's move on.

Entree:
-The entrees were pretty divided between ""east"" and ""west"". Cha siu pork, broccolini (my personal favorite), bok choy, herb chicken, BBQ pork buns, siu mai?? Beef wellington, sirloin steak...I must say though, this buffet is catered to the Asian tourists. It didn't have a great variety of items- just large quantities of it. They do have a large variety of pastas, but they were not impressive. Nothing stood out for me besides the steak with killer horseradish. 

Soup:
-Jeez. Maybe because I'm a huge soup person, but this selection was really poor. Your standard chicken noodle, clam chowder, vegetable minestrone...They do have a section by the entrees that is prepared ""per order"" but that wasn't good either. It wasn't customized in any way- it was just poured out by a lady with two huge soup pots. 

Seafood:
-Though it was late at night, but they were keeping it coming with all the fresh seafood! Though the one everyone only grabs for is the snow crab...I was going for the cocktail shrimp.However...the salmon, tilapia and other fish were amazing. Not the cream of the crop, but stood out enough for me to keep going back for more. 

Dessert:
-Sad!. Though, I do enjoy their cobblers (but it's so messy). They turned off the ice cream machines pretty early, so all we had were flan, carrot cake, tiramisu and some other chocolate cakes. Wasn't impressed, but I do like they were in small portions so you could try everything. 

Sushi bar:
-Mehhhhh. The sushi was okay, nigiri was not bad but not too fresh looking. The rolls were falling apart so it did not seem like the sushi chef was putting his heart and soul into each roll. 

Pros:
-Seating is spacious. Lots of room (I guess not enough, if we still had to wait in line for 40 minutes)! 
-Great service. Our server kept coming over to make sure we were okay. We were brought tons of drinks to wash down our meal. 

Cons:
-Mediocre food. Nothing stood out, but nothing was terribly bad. Just not what I expected for paying $55 a person for dinner (holiday special price). 

For some reason food at a buffet just looks better on someone else's plate. Or maybe I'm just super greedy and expected more...regardless, it doesn't hurt to come here but if you can, definitely check out the other buffets first since they are the same price range.",9,7,7

Luckily, we got two buffet passes for free using MyVegas, so we can't really complain too much.  We came here for lunch on a Tuesday, and the line wasn't too terrible.  We were very entertained, however, by the family of four who tried to cut us in line and then threw an absolute SHIT FIT when when they were told to get back in line and wait their turn like the rest of us.  We got to laugh at them and walk to our table while they screamed at the poor cashier. 
   The food itself was...okay.  There weren't a ton of great options, and nothing really stood out to me, but nothing was inedible.  I went back for turkey, mashed potatoes, and gravy more times than I care to admit, but everything else was just meh and I was content with just a small taste of the other dishes.  The best part was that we arrived close enough to dinner time that we were able to wait a little bit for them to bring the crab legs out.  In theory, the crab legs were available at 4 for us to go up and get some.  In reality, however, the crab leg line turned into a full on pit fight right at 4pm.  We were there a couple of days before Mayweather-Pacquiao, but I guess the other buffet patrons didn't want to spring for Pay-Per-View and decided to have their own boxing match when the crab arrived.  People were pushing and shoving, cutting line for crab legs.  We decided to sip our drinks and wait for the carnage to clear,and then went up after about half an hour to get some crab legs.  And I will say, the legs were delicious!  They were nice and fresh, and it was awesome to have them split down the middle.  If you go over to, I believe, the Asian food section, you can hand them your plate of crab legs and they'll steam them up for you.  Pretty cool. 
     The turkey, mashed potatoes, and crab legs were the highlight of the meal. I'd come back here if we had free passes and made sure to come near crab leg time, but I don't think we'd pay to eat here.",2,2,2

The usual sweet station (pancakes, waffles, etc.) with a pretty thick slice of french toast.  The french toast was awesome!  They also had a few different slices of pizza that go well with a breakfast theme.  I usually shy away from pizza at a buffet, but I'm glad I had these thin-crust yummies.  Now, the one part that didn't really fit in for me was the chinese food station.  I can eat cold pizza or fried chicken for breakfast, but chinese food at 8am doesn't really do it for me.  If you can eat it that early, more power to you!  

In regards to the service, it was really great!  Very attentive and checked in the right amount of times.  The buffet was very clean and organized.

the food: prime rib was pretty good! one of the best ive had in Vegas Buffets. They had some crab claws that night which tasted more sweet than their king crab legs. However only if they can crack them a little better will be great.   everything else was pretty decent as for a buffet quality. 

the desserts: it was as good as i expected. everything was too sweet. Kind of disappointed cuz i love desserts...hope they can improve this section. 

the service: the waiter that served our table was always kind of in a rush and didnt finish listen to what we asked for and walked away very quickly. so this needs a little improvement as well.

im generous to give 4 stars cuz honestly $40 for sooo much food...its really decent.",3,0,0

We did not know the price going in, had limited time, were staying at Bellagio and figured it would be the least expensive dining option inside the hotel.  Not so sure about that now! In our minds, I think we had the price at $50-60 for two. 

My thought on buffets--generally not a fan and prefer a more intimate dining experience.  I have referred to buffets as ""trough feeding"" and stick to the description.  Unless you have a huge appetite and a super amped digestive system, it's doubtful you'll be able to eat $86 worth.  AND, the receipt says ""Thank you for keeping your dining experience under two hours"" so they're not wanting you to stay long and go in for third and fourth rounds. 

Back to the buffet at hand.  Twelve food stations, beautiful fresh fruit, plentiful salad bar and desserts to die for.  The selections were good--prime rib, boiled shrimp on ice, crab legs, salmon, and every other meat you can imagine.  I even saw Yorkshire pudding! The food was good, the stations were efficient and well arranged and it was not a problem at all to get in and out under their suggested two hour window.  

The price just sticks in my craw.  The only other buffet I have paid that kind of money for is the Sunday Brunch at Grove Park Inn. That IS an experience and it is worth the money.  This--not so much.",0,2,0

The spicy tuna roll was actually pretty close to something you get from a sushi bar!  Smoked salmon had the right balance of not being being too salty and a hint of smoky flavor, shrimp cocktail was pretty big and cocktail sauce was not too sweet or sour.

The Buffet at Bellagio is open until 10 pm so I trekked over there with my husband to check it out.   

The line was extremely long but moved fast.  It costs $29.99 per person to eat here which wasn't too bad considering beverages were included as well as dessert.   

One of their draws is the never ending snow crab legs.  I'm not into snow crab legs so I passed but other people were piling their plates to the ceiling with those things.   

I went through the buffet line 3 times.  

Must try:   Mashed Potatoes, Heirloom Tomato Salad, and Broccolini 

Meh:  Kobe Beef Tenderloin (didn't taste like anything special and extremely dry)
Prime Rib (way too bloody) 

Gross:   Macaroni and cheese, pizza, ""homemade"" sausages and most of the desserts.  

The only good thing at the dessert buffet was the chocolate mousse in a waffle shell.

The roasted lamb was very good in my opinion. In addition to that, obviously there's a big selection of breakfast foods and two omelette making stations to custom make your omelette for you.

There was a huge line (1+ hour wait) to get in, but we stood in it hoping that we wouldn't be disappointed when we finally got to eat.

When we finally did get sat, we were seated at a booth towards the back of the restaurant.  The location was further away from the buffet than some would prefer, but I was happy to have a booth.  Some of the 2-seater tables were very small and looked quite uncomfortable, but I guess if you're planning to eat your way through the buffet, you likely get up enough that your butt won't hurt from the uncomfortable chairs.  I digress...

There was so much food it was hard to choose what to eat.  The menu items were unbelievable.  Kobe beef. Veal. Duck. Lamb. Free range turkey. Sushi. Crab legs. Pastas. Salads. It was definitely cool to see and taste food that I've only heard about (like Kobe beef) and to be able to eat as much as I wanted, but aside from the variety of food, I wasn't that impressed.  Everything was still just over-processed, over-cooked buffet food.  The Kobe beef was tough and over cooked.  The free range chicken was ok but still a little tough.  The sushi was fresh but still not great... you get the idea.

The dessert buffet was the same. I was impressed with the quantity and look of the desserts, but the taste was just ok.  The bread pudding was really good but other stuff looked prettier than it tasted.  

For $40 bucks I wasn't too upset about my visit to the Buffet at Bellagio and I certainly got enough to eat, but, like I said, the quantity was massive, but the taste left something to be desired.  I wouldn't necessarily go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go either.",0,0,0

This used to be a highly rated buffet and I used to somewhat look forward to coming here but it may be possible that the buffet has gone down in quality or my buffet eating days are over.

They do have a pretty broad selection of foods from Chinese, Japanese, Italian and everything in-between.  There definitely is no lack of variety here.  

Many of the items are standard fare at the higher end buffets in Sin City.  A mountain of shrimp cocktail and snow crab legs on ice always draw a small line.  The shrimp cocktail was it's usual, appetizing, but the snow crab was not as fresh as usual and had a funny taste to it.  The meat was hard to get out of the shells which is usually a sign that the crab wasn't fresh.  Maybe being there on a Monday has something to do with it.

The selection of fish was great.  Salmon that was prepared sashimi, smoked, poached, and every which way you can imagine.  There was also swordfish and sea bass.

For dessert fans there is a huge bar filled with mini cheesecakes, carrot cake, soft serve ice cream, creme brulee, and much, much more.  This is great for anyone who just wants to try a little bit of everything.

I would still venture to the Vegas buffets.  Once in awhile you just like the variety and don't care enough to think of a specific restaurant to eat at.  The smorgasbord in the Bellagio is a good backdrop for an eating competition or where quantity rules over quantity.",2,0,0

For dinner, it's usually at least 45 min depending how early\/late you eat dinner. Even from the line, you could smell the aroma of all the yummy foods! 

My boyfriend and I ate here recently and we were there for a good 2 hours... AT LEAST!!! Yup, we were eating THE WHOLE TIME! First, we started with the crab. Here, they have BOTH snow and KING Crab. The snow crab is located on the left side of the buffet, near the sushi island. The king crab is on the other side of the buffet, where the salad and fruits are. What's great about this place is that they'll reheat\/resteam the crab for you if you'd like. All you have to do is stand in front of the area where you order a seafood crepe and ask them to reheat it for you. They'll boil some water, put your plate of crab legs in, and give you a nice HOT plate of crab legs. That's the BEST! 

Sushi, here, is good! They have sashimi and nigiri and the yummy seaweed salad. This buffet also has different kinds of cooked fish like salmon, sea bass, etc. There's an asian selection of foods included pork steamed buns, thai inspired pan fried noodles, fried rice, chinese broccoli with garlic, and other stuff. They have a variety of soups like corn chowder, chicken noodle soup, miso soup, chili, etc. They have a salad, bread, fruit section. They also have a gourmet pizza section. OMG! I absolutely LOVE their pesto and shrimp pizza. IT'S DELISH! Their margherita pizza's good, too! They also have the section devoted for the carnivores! Prime rib, lamb, chicken, and turkey are always waiting on the cutting boards with their juices oozing out. Their mashed potatoes are yummy. They have sauteed mushrooms, pastas (like ravioli, spaghetti, tortellini), and cocktail shrimp. 

The dessert area is awesome. They have bread pudding, bananas foster, sorbet, ice cream, creme brulee, tiramisu, cheesecake, carrot cake, flan, and so on and so forth.

$85.98 for two for Sunday brunch with bottomless mimosas ($30\/person, $12.99 mimosas). For this price I was looking forward to at least average to decent food, but I had a hard time taking more than one bite of the foods I put on my plate. 

Let's start with their meats - prime rib, ham, and turkey. The prime rib was the most disappointing of all. It was dry and salty. The friendly lady behind the counter offered to bring me a fresh cut price, which I waited for, but even then, it was still super dry and not tasty. The ham and turkey alike were both dry, but not bad.

Breakfast carbs - pancakes, French toast, and Belgium waffles. The pancakes were not bad. They were smaller than average, about the size of my palm, which I think is a good size. It was not too moist and mushy, or dry. The French toast was filled with chocolate hazelnut spread and bananas, which sounds really good, but I think they've been sitting under the lamp for too long because it was extremely mushy and the crusts were hard, solid hard. The Belgium waffle alike was disappointing. It was dry and hard, too hard for me to even bite into.

Dessert - carrot cake, key lime tart, and raspberry macaron. The carrot cake was good. I really liked it, moist and creamy. The key lime tart was neither very limey nor sweet. It was just a little bland. The raspberry macaron was just a fail. It was wayyyy to hard and the filling wasn't the yummy chewy texture, but was the hard chewy. I felt like my jaw was having a battle with the filling. 

When I went to The Buffet at Wynn for brunch, I paid the same price, but their food was just so, so much better. I mean this wasn't horrible, but I probably won't come again.",2,0,0

We'd had a fairly late lunch so ended up getting to the Bellagio (after several recommendations) about 9.45pm for the late sitting. We had to wait about 10mins before we were seated. Interestingly enough we had a couple tell us to not bother on their way out. They seemed disappointed. We decided to go with it nonetheless, as we were tired and wanted to eat!

After being seated we grabbed out plates and went to investigate. What range! There is so much to suit all tastes.  I'd had a seafood urge all day so grabbed a plate full of great cold and hot fish and seafood optionis including crab leg, sushi, bbq cod, risotto etc. It was all tasty and fresh. They had great dimsum too, albeit just one type of dumpling.

Where I was truly blown away by this buffet was the meat options. We went all out and between us we had beef wellington, rack of lamb, beef brisket, steak, duck, turkey, roast beef and chicken. I'm sure there were other options too.

Highlight of the buffet for me was the duck combined with the sweet potato mash. Incredible.

I'd recommend going later if you don't have huge plans for that night. We seemed to have a much greater range of options than suggested by other reviews and we didn't have to wait long at all.",0,0,0

Even during the slower periods of the day, there's always a line coming out of the entrance. The food here must be good right? I mean, it's a luxury hotel casino for crying out loud! Is it any good at all? 

Yes. Yes it is.

Although the wait may be a little lengthy for even the most patient of patrons, I must say that the Buffat at Bellagio did do it's fair service. First and foremost, there's plenty to choose from. Although it seems like seafood is the focus here, there are items such as freshly carved meats and sides for the taking, as well as a fairly decent array of Italian dishes. Going back to the seafood, however, it was definitely up to par for being a buffet. 

Most places, when they do seafood, it's usually budget-level offerings such as cod, and maybe salmon or catfish. Not here. The Snow crab legs were absolutely divine. There probably wasn't a plate in the entire restaurant that didn't have crab legs on it. The sushi tasted surprisingly clean and fresh, which again, I must say is a little odd for buffet-style cuisine!

Prime rib? Perfect. It was a perfect medium-rare and didn't even need au jus to enhance the flavor. Very good stuff. 

My only complaint, is that the service is a tad rough. I understand it's busy, but something more than 2 visits to my table for refills on beverages needs to be addressed. That's the only thing that's holding me back from giving the Buffet at Bellagio a full 5-star rating.",0,0,2

We only waited for about 20 minutes before being seated.  

People that eat in buffet have a tendency to overindulge.  Our party of 6 were very good about selecting foods and making sure that we eat what we selected.  That way you do not gorge or waste food.  However, we saw some exceptions.  Two women (Marin County types) wanted a whole slab of ribs which they took to their table near us.  They also had huge helpings of other goodies, but at the end we observed that the food was wasted including 6 large pieces of of bbq ribs.  What pigs!  No wonder they were overweight.

Also were observed grabby people, particularly at the helping of snow crabs.  You can rest assured that they were also wasted.  Buffets also bring out the poorly mannered patrons on how they treat the staff.  One woman wanted a piece of prime rib and didn't want it cut from the end, but from the middle.  When the chef sliced her a piece, she rejected it and wanted a thicker slab.  Why didn't she take two smaller slices and not be such a jerk to chef.

The rest room accomodations had only two urinals in the mens room.  For a dining area this size, it was wholly lacking.  Luckily the Bellagio, outside the buffet had plenty of rest rooms. 

The service was very good and they promptly clean our table of excessive plates.  The food was very well prepared and plenty of it.  The dining area was exceptionally clean.  We left a generous tip to our headwaiter, though I didn't see others leaving anything.

― Manoj Vaz

I feel the above quote basically sums up my view about the Buffet at Bellagio:

It's definitely not what I expected, but my family and I enjoyed it nonetheless.

During our recent vacation, my mom expressed interest in wanting to try a Vegas buffet.  I had been to the Buffet at Bellagio nearly 10 years ago and remembered it to be quite decent.  And since we all wanted to view the Bellagio Conservatory, we decided to check off two things on our ""to do"" list and made our way to the Bellagio Hotel.

NOTE:
1.  The Buffet is near the ""O"" Theatre.  Follow the signs.
2.  We went for lunch.  $23.99 per adult.

Though it wasn't tremendously busy when we arrived, we still had to wait 5-10 minutes to get seated.  The server took our drink orders and then my mom, brother and I, were off to explore the food stations.

Overall, the selection and variety of the food offerings\/stations was satisfactory, but I would have to say that nothing in particular compelled me to return twice to the same area.  Of course, one should always make room or at least try the different cuisines prepared at buffets in general.....at least that's how I view dining at a buffet.

All things considered, my brother, mom, and myself chose items including salads, fruits, pastas, chicken, burgers, vegetables, and soup.  And though all the food was prepared well, the food station that left a lasting impression on me was dessert!  My mom and I sampled various cheesecakes (including seasonal pumpkin flavor), key lime pie, and carrot cake.  Portion sizes were just right where you felt you had enough and were not overly stuffed.  It was definitely a sweet end to the meal for sure.

SERVICE:  It was alright.  The cashier was a bit rough, but the server in the dining room was very friendly and patient.

BOTTOM LINE:  Good variety of food stations\/cuisine.  Dessert was excellent!",14,11,14

I (loving all of these things) ventured out west for Valentine's Day. What better way to spend time with the one you love than wandering the strip with a colossal drink in your hand? We woke up early Saturday and ventured over to the Bellagio to enjoy their legendary breakfast. I have never been to a restaurant where the entrance looks like the entrance to the Incredible Hulk ride in Orlando. Winding around several velvet ropes till you reach the pay counter and receive your buffet ticket. There were 6 of us total, and the process was actually very smooth. We were seated quickly with a smile. We then wandered the absolutely endless amount of food options in the buffet line. I mean it was 10:00am, but they had everything from scrambled eggs to sushi. The only thing that was missing was any sweet breakfast item (who doesn't have pancakes or waffles?) All in all, the food was above ""meh"". I can't say that I was blown away, but I wasn't horrified either. I was not expecting it to be that good given that it was a buffet situation, but overall - it was pretty... average. 

Would I go back to this restaurant? Probably not. I have heard that the Wicked Spoon is much better. But then again - is one buffet really that much better than another? Isn't that the eternal question?",0,1,0

I craved it.  The bronze and silver shined, the service was filled with energy and excitement, and the food--extraordinary.  I remember sitting down and just polishing off lots of carp and lox and salmon.  

But those days are no more--and they have gone been since the crash of the economy in 2008--this Buffet has never come back.

On my last visit, which will be my last--the bronze and silver was worn and did not shine, the service was dull and angry, and the food mediocre.  Gone was the great quality Lox and Carp and Salmon.  It reminded me of a Buffet that was headed toward Circus Circus level.  

But people keep lining up--because it's 1990's strong reputation lives on with people that never experienced how great it used to be.  They accept mediocrity because they never knew superiority.  Chicago Grandma tells her 20 something grandkids, ""don't forget to check out the Bellagio Buffet, it's the best in Vegas...""  But grandma has not been there since Millenium New Years Eve in 1999.  

There are others that have those great memories of the 1990's at this Buffet, know that it is no more, but keeping checking-in hoping that it comes back, only to leave disappointmented. 

This buffet has no incentive to improve because people line up like cattle for the slaughter not knowing any better--just what they heard.  And if they can keep filling the seats without improving--it's a cash cow for the casino--it may make more money than some of the tables many nights.  

It's depressing to see what it has become.

If you are in the area.. it is worth trying but if there's time on your hands and there are options available, I would seek elsewhere.
I stayed at the Bellagio for 2 nights and ate at the buffet twice.  First experience was Dinner. They have your typical meat carving stations, salad bar, a variety of international selections etc and dessert bar. I always go for the seafood,since the price is typically priced at the high $40s per person, I like to get my money's worth like probably every other person who hits up a buffet lol.
The seafood selection was very slim but they did have crab legs and shrimp cocktail and a few salads that had seafood in them as well as a sushi station and poke. 
The desserts were amazing. It's doesn't take much to impress me since I have a sweet tooth. 
Overall my concern was, I ate breakfast the next morning at the buffet and I saw many of the same items that were served the night before.  I think they definitely have to change that up.

Since we were already there we decided to stay and eat. My 8yr old son only ate 4 slices of pizza : (

These are the items  I tried:
beef wellington - it was dry..the 
Kobe sirloin - tough and tasteless 
Ribeye- chewy 
Clams (clam bake) there were more veggies in it than clams - i think they should  just prepared it with butter and  white wine
Pork bun- blah
Chocolate  eclair was dry  
Creme  brulee- texture was a bit thick almost like pudding.  The burned sugar on top did crack when you break into it.. probably  sat out too long
Fruit - watermelon  was dried and shriveled  up. I cant believe they would  still serve it. 


Highlights !!!
Crablegs - ask the staff behind the counter to steam  them, yum!
Lamb- very good , not gamey
Broccolini & mashed  potatoes - excellent 
Bowtie  pasta with cream sauce  and  sun dried tomatoes - my favorite dish here
Pizzas - cant go wrong 
Poke & sushi - fresh 
Pesto mash- good
Desserts- tiramisu, cheesecake

The line to get in is split between reservations and non reservations. I came at an off peak time so I got right in. It's also not very expensive when compared to the amount of food you have access to. There's also plenty of tables and bar areas to grab a seat as the place is very big.

I had everything from vegetable stir fry to penne vodka and it was delicious. Food lines moved very quickly and your drink was always refilled in an acceptable amount of time. They have a pretty impressive dessert section as well.

The Asian dishes were boring, the Italian ones seemed like they were prepared very sloppily. 

Dessert was okay, but I'd rather go get a cheesecake or gelato at a cafe in Vegas somewhere. The creme brulee was really nice though, but no where near good enough to make up for the $36 and the epic wait to get in (about an hour).

The positives of my experience were that they offer an express line for M Life members...USE IT!  The line was crazy long and I can't understand anyone waiting for hours to eat.  

The staff were agreeable and accommodating.  Our waiter was Fe, he was awesome and smiley.  We were seated by a nice lady.  I didn't get her name but she was cute and short.  None of the hostesses got annoyed with our request to sit at a booth so that was pretty cool.

Okay.  The food is really what people come here for and I really wasn't very impressed.  I have eaten here before and I recall there being a better selection and more that I wanted to eat.  I should note that I wasn't super hungry though so perhaps that posed a problem.

I had a small plate that consisted of mashed potatoes and gravy (good), broccolini (good but cold), cold shrimp (hard to mess up), mushrooms (good), and half of a baked chicken breast (also good). When my husband returned with tons of stuff on his plate I stole several pieces of bacon and ate that with my remaining potatoes and that was pretty much the highlight of my meal.  Bacon and mashed potatoes hit the spot for me.  

I requested some coffee so I could figure out dessert.  I came back with a walnut brownie (pretty tasty), a double chocolate cookie (I didn't like it), a small pecan pie (standard taste), a small key lime tart (very tart, probably good but I wasn't in the mood I think), and I think that was it.  I made my husband eat the key lime tart and the cookie and then we were out of there.

To make the most of your Vegas experience and somehow save some money during the day so you can obviously spend twice as much at night, the Buffet at the Bellagio is the answer. After you wake up with ample time to recover from your hangover, find your way to the line here and get here at 3PM. You'll get in about 30 minutes while they're still serving lunch. Grab a small plate to sample anything from the lunch entrees that look unique. This is your appetizer. Now, wait until 4PM for them to put out the crab legs, seafood, and dinner entrees. Your first and last meal of the day is now ready. With this strategy, you just got to taste the lunch AND dinner items for the lunch price ($25).

Brunch was $15 more per person due to the special occasion but it didn't seem to add anything special, extra, or unique. 

Tried a little bit of everything. Eggs benedict was sitting or on a hot plate, quote mediocre, possibly because they were not fresh. Prime rib was quite tough. Had a large shrimp cocktail area. Various baked fish. Salmon was okay, cod was absolutely horrendous. It was like rubber. It's very hard to get fish to a point where it is actually difficult to cut with a knife. They succeeded with the cod. 

They had an assortment of baked goods that looked much better than they tasted. Fruits as well, sliced that were fine, it's hard to mess up slicing fruit to be honest... Biscuits tasted stale. Best thing was the creamed corn, perfectly hometown buffet.

The meats...how can you go and not try them? They were okay to good. They had prime rib, rack of lamb, wagyu beef.. Good but no stars. The lobster mac n cheese was satisfying albeit a bit runny.

I guess some people don't know the concept of space.. she was like all up on my back waiting and such.. it really annoyed me.. me being passive aggressive I try to be slick and just kinda walk back lean back like I don't notice her.. or try to stretch which makes her step back a bit...

BACK OFF OLDER WOMEN YOU!! :I

Bellagio does have a wider selection on food compared to the Wynn.. But i Must say that the QUALITY of Wynn's food is ten times better than Bellagio's....

Prime rib at the Wynn.. i can't even explain it because it was soo juicy and delicious.. Bellagio's prime rib made me disappointed.. it was just a small piece of well cooked prime rib.. it made me sad looking at it that I barely ate the whole piece that I asked for!

seabass selection was not too tasty..
smoked salmon and alaskan crab legs pretty good.. a bit too frozen for me though.
dessert selection is a bit more.. i enjoyed the ice cream and fruits.. the flan was bad.........
sushi selection.. the usual: california rolls\/hand rolls\/vegetarian spring rolls\/rice\/noodles
pasta was delicious though. the crab ravioli!!!!!!

Service was horrible. Two waiters literally started yelling at each other from across the buffet fighting about a stupid tray. Its also nearly impossible to get drinks. Luckily a new girl came towards the end who was much more on top of it.

Food quality was horrible. I refuse to ever go back solely on that. Not the fact of people obnoxiously stuffing their face with endless crab who apparently have never been taught how to eat properly. I myself tried the crab to have an extremely salty and watery taste in mouth, which is due to it being sat out for waaaay too long. All the other food we had, had maybe one or two bites taken out, then was set to the side to go and try to save our taste buds with something else.

What started out as a fresh innovative buffet at reasonable prices for Las Vegas is now just the opposite.

Gone are all the imaginative dishes, such as exotic fruits, main courses like grilled quail, Beef Wellington, Chinese ribs, to be replaced with rotisserie chicken, poor quality roasts, or just nothing at all.  No more drink service - it's now pour your own, kind of like McDonald's.

Everything has been cheapened to the point of ridiculousness.  And the once attentive and engaging staff is now most often simply sullen.  At least the lines are much shorter -- I wonder why.

They might explain that they serve what people eat.  Wrong answer!  The Bellagio is not a middle of the road hotel, and the buffet should not be a Golden Corral, certainly not for the rather extreme prices charged here.  Get back on track, buffet managers, and be the Bellagio!

Some notables:

Good selection, with a little bit of everything: 

--Seafood choices consisted of Alaska and regular crabs; shrimp, smoked salmon, sushi, caviar (Ikura and American caviar), seaweed salad, mussel salad and calamari salad
--Carvery choices included rack of lamb, Asian pork belly; beef Wellington
--Asian foods included Broccoli Beef, Beef Panang, chicken shiu mai
--Extensive dessert section

Some good items:
--Alaska king crab legs were split and served cold, though servers can steam upon request
--the mussels and seafoods were free from grit and only very slightly over-cooked compared to other buffets
--Beef Wellington and rack of lamb were just right--only complaint was the saltiness of the mushroom filling in the Beef Wellington
--Extensive salad selection, including a mussel salad

Competent, unobtrusive service: our servers got us the cranberry juice and ice cream

Some not so hot items:

--Veal osso bucco: inconsistent quality--one us had a perfectly tender piece, but mine was overcooked and leathery
--Sushi was inconsistent: one of us had sushi with too much vinegar; mine was just right
--Pork belly was too salty (due to oversmoking?)

Most ppl would probably question why we even took our two children there in the first place...Well again for the experience. But to pay almost $50 a person (ages 3+) is just plain taking advantage. Yes! That's what we paid for each x 4. Then when we asked the manager why they charge so much for children. His response was ""we can't put an age on it as some children of similar ages consume a lot of food"". Then my husband asked ""if you can't put an age on it, why is over the age of 3 charged at adult rate?"". Your still putting an age limit in it! 

The manager couldn't answer, just to say that's the way it is. I will also say of the many places we stayed the ones who treated us with more ""respect"" and ""courtesy"" were less than ""4 star"" rating...go figure. As I mentioned before we had high expectations and were very disappointed by the way we were treated. We will not be back & hope others who do continue to go don't have children...or disabled children for that matter receive this type of treatment. Because I don't want to bore anyone I won't go into the menu...only to say mine & my daughter's plate was full of blood from the (oh so rare) meats...which we could not eat.",1,4,0

For starters, I was excited they offer caviar since it is not an item I get to eat often. I tried the American black caviar which had very fishy taste and not in a good way. I have  tried caviar at the Ritz Carlton buffet on multiple occasions and what was provided at the Bellagio paled in comparison. Okay, let's move on to some nigiri. The sushi rice was horrid. It's temperature inferred that it had been stored in a refrigerator for quite awhile. The rice had a very gummy texture which indicated that it had been overworked in its preparation. The actual fish was average quality but in combination with the rice, made it miserable to eat.  Maybe the crayfish will be better. Nope. Other than being some of the smallest mud bugs I have seen, they had absolutely no seasoning.  Good thing the salmon cooked on the griddle??? was over cooked.....oh.....wait a sec. The Beef Wellington was cooked past medium well making the dish very dry. I also have never heard of pork Oso Bucco which was on the buffet as well. My recommendation to the chef, stick with beef!!!! A question, is any senior chef at the bellagio tasting these dishes?? The paella was a soggy mess. In fairness, the lamb was fine even though it was labeled as leg of lamb yet had rib bones attached. hmmmmmm.  At this point I gave up trying different items and left very disappointed.",0,0,0

Having a buffet in Vegas to me is an integral part of the whole ""Vegas experience."" My fiance and I had decided to come to the Buffet at the Bellagio, mostly based on reviews from Yelp. The lunch price is comparable to other buffets (about $30 per person after taxes). The ambiance of the place was pleasant, and the service staff were cordial and professional. The line to pay moved pretty quickly, and they even had a person directing ""traffic,"" so that patrons wouldn't go in a line that appeared to have nobody in it. Once we were assigned to our seats, we hit the buffets. The first thing that we both noticed was a large covered area and a sign that said something to the effect of ""Pardon our noise while we remodel."" During lunch service... both me and my fiance thought it a bit odd, but nevertheless, we went along with our meal. We grabbed several items that appealed to both of us: mashed potatoes, sushi, veggies, pasta, pizza, kind of run of the mill buffet food. Having already been to another buffet the day before, we thought to compare notes to what we had experienced from their competition.

The food was, in a word, alright. Nothing insanely special, most of it could have used a dash of salt or more seasoning. The sushi, the two varieties that they had, were sub-par. The mashed potatoes were fine, again, nothing to write home about. The pasta was again fine, but when we had gone for seconds and wanted to get the same thing, two things happened: first, the pasta that I had tried before was completely out, and the kitchen staff seemed in no hurry to replace it, and second, the pasta we had before now had a cream sauce and mushrooms.

Having had our fill of foods, we headed to the dessert bar, and filled up with an assorted plate of tartlets. I also grabbed a bowl of bananas foster (I think since it didn't have a sign). We both wanted to grab some chocolate chip cookies, but they were out and again the staff seemed in no hurry to replace them. It also happened that several of the platters moved places. I could tell because I found them in a different location than their respective tags. I found that rather frustrating.

Most of the desserts: cannoli, pecan tart, cheesecake, and whatever else we had, were forgettable. Okay bordering on not so good.

The highlights of the dessert bar were the lemon meringue tartlets and the berry mousse tartlets. 

My biggest complaint, and possible health concern, were the bananas foster. It didn't taste like the alcohol was completely cooked out of it. I had the thought that I could get buzzed from a few servings. This is a family buffet, and my concern would be that children could grab a bowl of dessert bananas with alcohol in them...

All in all, the service was good from the wait-staff and the ambiance (aside from the booths that were just a little low for my liking), but the food was lackluster and inconsistent, and the kitchen staff seemed in no hurry to replenish the empty dishes.",1,0,0

Price for dinner was $43.99, which wasn't too bad compared to the higher end buffets I mentioned above.

Came here at 8pm on Saturday night and the line was still kind of long (it looked like a one hour wait). Luckily, I took advantage of the Mlife Pearl Status and got to skip the line. Quick tip: if you are staying at a M Life hotel, you can bill your meal to your room so that you can rack up Mlife tier credits.

The food was pretty good here. Their premium items were pretty good (e.g. prime rib, crab legs, shrimp cocktail). They also had lamb chops and a peppered hangar steak that were pretty darn good. The dessert that I especially enjoyed was the white chocolate cone (would definitely recommend that). 

This is still one of the better value buffets on the Strip. It doesn't have the flash, design, or variety of the Buffet at the Wynn or Bacchanal. But if you just want to have a good dinner buffet that doesn't break the bank, the Buffet at Bellagio is a pretty safe bet.",3,1,0

This shows how much a buffet of this caliber still is one of the Top 5 buffets in Vegas. 

-IMHO-

My top 5 buffets are:

Bellagio - The Buffet
Wynn - The Buffet
Mirage - Cravings
Planet Hollywood - Spice Market Buffet
Mandalay Bay - Bayside Buffet

The buffet line can get really long but mostly on weekends and the time of day but if your an Mlife Gold member, you have your own line and no wait! Just some perks of being an Mlife card holder. ;)

The buffet is expensive especially in a hotel like Bellagio but one thing I heard was to come an hour early to pay for the breakfast price or punch price before they start switching the plates and you save around $12 - $20 USD. Not bad Ehhh....

The selection is superb which only a buffet like Bellagio would have with a meat station that has Kobe beef, juicy and tender prime rib, suculent baby pigs, chicken and Roast beef.

The seafood section which is my favorite part if the buffet, second would be dessert, has the huge large size shrimp in ice with the cocktail sauce on the side and the king crab legs which are already cut in half so you don't have to break the legs and dig the meet out but they have clampers available. 

The desert section is just a half circle in the buffet and includes different kinds of cookies, cakes, pastries and last but not least GELATO!! =P 

What also seperates this buffet with the other strip buffets is that it has a restroom located inside the buffet so you don't have to walk outside through the casino and be tempted to gamble. Most buffets were designed for to walk out when using the restroom and gamble but this to me was a +++.  Did I mention the customer aervicewas excellent, one incident proved how my waitress went above and beyond for their buffet guests. I was planning on going back to get a new plate and decided to leave my cell phone on the table and when I came back to my table it disappeared and I thought someone had stolen it. Then my waitress came back and told me she thought I had left the buffet and wanted to keep it in safe hands incase it went amiss and I was so impressed with what she had done especially watching out for the customer. I couldn't remember her name but I do remember what she looked like and I'll never forget how honest and caring she was unlike other waitresses in buffets who were just having a bad day. Psssh!

I shall return to this buffet eveytime I visit Vegas.

I can honestly say the quality has went down hill drastically. We went for the weekend brunch on a saturday afternoon. I expected some really good food since I remembered really enjoying it before and even compared it higher to the Wynn. 

The selection was very low at the items were not as high quality as many of the yelpers mentioned. For brunch, they had regular buffet fare, breakfast foods, pancakes, eggs, potatoes, waffles, french toast, omlette station. This type of food is being served at any buffet and there's nothing special. I noticed they had 2 breakfast stations which makes the selection even smaller.

Sushi..california rolls, and vege rolls. C'mon guys, if you want to be a top player, serve some more specialized rolls. California rolls are too common nowadays at the buffets in vegas, please serve them with something more special such as tempura, salmon tempura, yellow tail tuna, albacore to make it really ""stand"" out from the competition.

Soups...mushroom and chicken noodle. another ""average"" selection.

Meats, turkey, roast beef, and lamb, pretty standard again.

Seafood, there was no crab legs for the weekend brunch which I thought was stranged.

Bottom line, if you want just an over priced average brunch, Bellagio is the winner. They don't even have real ice cream, it comes from a frozen yogurt machine. I had a wayyy better brunch at one of the Station casinos off the strip.",0,0,0

However, there was also a fair number of misses - the roast meat was dry and sliced too thick, the cheese blintzes too sweet, and the croissants dry. A lot of the staples were solid, but you don't go to a $36 brunch for pancakes and hash browns.

When the lunch selection rolled around, I was pleasantly surprised by the spring rolls and the tasty (albeit limited) selection of sushi. The rest of the menu did not change much.

This is the only buffet I went to in Las Vegas so I don't know how it compares to Caesar's Palace or the Sterling Brunch. Not a bad option if you really want to experience a Las Vegas buffet but perhaps not worth the high price tag in my opinion (unless you're able to make 2 meals out of it!)

Some tips:
-Go towards the end of the brunch time so you can pay the lower brunch price tag and still enjoy some lunch specialties.
-Try to go in between meal times (e.g. 3PM) in order to avoid long queues.
-If you're there for brunch or breakfast, ask for orange juice! It's fresh squeezed and delicious.",1,0,0

Breakfast
Fantastic pancakes and thick-cut bacon.  Better than most I have when I go out for brunch.  French toast was thick but bland.  Cheese blintzes good but better with strawberry sauce on top of them.

Lunch
Very good prime rib and leg of lamb at the carving station.  Asked for medium rare - got medium rare.  The rubs on each were very flavorful.

Cocktail shrimp were nice and plump.  Tried a few vegetables and Singapore noodels that were just so-so.

I was disappointed there weren't any crab legs or something else that was a cut above the norm - steak, lobster, etc.

Dessert
Yeah, still had room.  Liked the sundae station (ground up Butterfingers as topping is a plus).  The fruit tart I tried was average but the chocolate chip cookie was very good.

Well maybe it's that people don't get out much.

For me it doesn't have to be a fancy meal to be good.  Yet Bellagio uses the term ""Gourmet"".  So be it.

Don't be fooled by fancy terms like ""prime rib"" or ""sushi"" or even Graham Kerr's favorite - Gourmet.

If you are looking for a lot of mediocre nearly tasteless food head down to the Bellagio, get in line and strap on your feeding bad.  At least the Char Siu Pork and Noodle dishes are good.  But not worth $40 and a wasted opportunity to eat at another fine Vegas restaurant on a Saturday Night.

If you want food that tastes good you'd do better at Noodles, First or hell go down to main street station.  You will spend less and get better food.

Trust me.

As a person who usually goes to cheap buffets, I was impressed with the selection of food (main course, salad, and dessert) they have. It's very well diverse while maintaining their quality. The only complaint I have would be the pastas. The marinara pasta's flavor was weak and the creamy pastas were very grainy (due to the cheesy sauce.)

The highlight? Prime rib. Add mashed potatoes, mashed yam, grilled mushroom & veggies (zuchinni and squash) make a perfect comfort food plate! I'm not a huge crab person so I can't criticize it (it was good though) but I can tell you their baked sea bass was perfect. Also, their sushi is surprisingly good for a buffet. If you like raw fish then you won't be disappointed. They've got the nigiris and poke salmon\/tuna. The seaweed salad gets a thumbs up too.

The line was ridiculously long but we were so glad we got to skip the line. It definitely wouldn't have been worth it if we had to wait in line.

We noticed that many of the selections were quite salty. It's as if they do that on purpose so we can drink more water and eat less. The king crab legs were good though! They should be steamed because everyone lines up to get them steamed. I didn't have any sushi but when I went to take a look it was quite sad. The rolls had so much rice and didn't look appealing at all. I enjoyed the quail that I made my boyfriend try it. It would have tasted better if there was less salt. Another good selection was the crawfish.

I think I expected something more, based on all the hype and hooplah.  But the Bellagio Buffet, in all its' glory, is still a BUFFET.  I don't know why I expected other, but I did.  That being said, it's a darn good buffet, with options that are not only not found at other buffets, but that a lot of people wouldn't get the chance to try elsewhere. (I doubt they serve Bluenose and Kobe Beef in, like, Iowa or whatever.)

*****TIP*****  We arrived 15 minuted before the end of lunch \/ beginning of dinner.  We paid the lunch price, but feasted on the dinner goodies.  Just plan to spend 2+ hours.  It's fun to do this when you go with a group and can pass the time with a few drinks and some good conversation.

The Not-So-Much:   
I was SO unimpressed with their desserts.  I know I'm in the minority here, but we grabbed a Flan, which was inedible, a Chocolate Mousse Cake with Hazelnuts (weak flavor) and a Lemon bar of some sort.  That was the best of the bunch, and even it was meh.
Also: The lamb was overcooked and chewey. (We like it rare, it was medium.)
The Crab Legs:  They were like sponges, you could squeeze the water out of them. Gross.

The Interesting:
Roast Quail
Bluenose (Very similar to Seabass. See the ""Awesome"" seciton.)

The Good:
Scallop Ceviche.
Seaweed Salad.
Fresh Mozarella Pesto.
Kobe Beef Sirloin (Flavorful but not tender.)

The Awesome:
Mashed Sweet Potatoes (With Ginger and Orange)
Bluenose (They prepared it in various ways.  I had 3 helpings!)
House-Cured Bacon (Think Smoked Pork Belly!  YUM!)
Smoked Trout (It was amazing.)
Salmon Nigiri (It was REALLY good. Definitely NOT Buffet Sushi Quality.)

As a vegetarian my options are usually limited and or boring and I don't get the value out them compared to someone with 5 pounds of snow crab legs.  Typically I'll wonder through a buffet to get an idea of what's there,  pick up a tiny little piece of a few good looking things and likely not like anything enough to try for seconds.  If I do get seconds it's because I didn't find enough eating on my round of picking to satisfy the hunger.   Desserts are really the only aspect I look forward to.   Buffets are usually bad to OK food that's rather costly and I usually eat too much and regret it after. 

The brunch here though...  I did my standard nipples round and liked most things I tried which placed me in an interesting situation of what I really wanted to consume there that day!  I ate mostly non-desserts... by choice!  The world nearly ended right there.  Not everything was amazing,  but most was good to great.  I left stuffed and unwilling to eat anything at all the rest of the day.... and it was worth it for once.

Is was expensive but for once worth it - $60 I think for the two of us sans alcohol.   Considering that  was all I wanted to eat that day and I really liked it I think that was a buffet fleecing that I don't regret and would revisit another time.",1,0,0

My friend and I were making a less than sober stagger across the strip when we saw signs for this buffet, and it sounded great. At about $38 with tax it is not cheap.

to me, a person who does not eat meat often buffet's seem like a rip off, but here I felt like I was the bandit.

There is a sushi area, it has your usual rolls, nigiri hand rolls etc. The real star here is the Poke, sliced raw fish tossed with soy sauce, scallions sesame seed oil and spices. usually poke of this quality is a $12 app for a martini glass sized bite. I opted for a full dinner plate of this great plate of raw fish.

Once I cleaned out the sea of all of it's treasures I explored the rest of the buffet. Artisan cheese plate, bok choy, quinoa, and many other gourmet items could be found.

My friend really enjoyed the kobe beef, it may have been a function of his BAC.

The dessert section also has many tasting sized bites great for allowing the maximum amount of flavors to be had.",2,1,1

The Bellagio, however, is a classic. I typically make my way to this particular buffet once a year.

Under $30 for a buffet lunch? That's almost unbeatable in Vegas, considering the quality of buffet you're getting - salads, seafood, Asian, Greek, American, an assortment of meats and seafood - go there during lunch. But also, if you arrive during the 11-3 lunch rush on weekends (which essentially spans the entire lunch time frame), be prepared with other forms of entertainment, as you'll most likely be graced with a 1-2 hour wait.

However, for dinner, they offer lamb, the beef wellington, crab legs, shrimp cocktail, steak tartare, and ahi\/salmon poke - in addition to the goodness they serve at lunch.

The online advertised price for weekend brunch is $27.99 and the price at the register is $31.99. We came at 1pm. We were hoping for more of a lunch but there was more of a breakfast- brunch variety. There were at least 4 eggs, bacon and sausage stations which I thought was a bit much... There were two omelette stations which were good, and there was a carving station with turkey and prime rib. The prime rib was very rare, the turkey was delicious. It was difficult to find someone to carve as the only person in the area was manning the omelets.

The line to get in took about an hour, which wasn't too bad, particularly because we played games in the line. If you enter the line when it's just under the entrance, the line will only be about 20 minutes.

The brunch had all of the fare that you would expect from brunch including the breakfast meats, omelet station, french toast (including chocolate and banana hazelnut), sushi (handmade spicy tuna rolls were really good), potatoes, cream of wheat, GRITS (made this southern boy happy), prime rib, turkey, and chicken.

The champagne that came with the meal was pretty good. It probably still only cost them $2 a bottle, but mixed with their orange juice, which was pretty good and seemed house-made, made for an excellent mimosa.

For the dinner menu, we stayed to try the crab. Note the king crab was WAY too salty, so I would suggest sticking to the normal legs even though EVERYONE else is getting the king's ( I was tricked...). The mussels were OK, but they weren't very meaty. The salmon and tune poke were pretty good also, and better than the nigiri pieces on rice.

Food was fine except the king crab legs were still frozen so they thawed all over the plate and table, making a mess of everything.  You could squeeze 1\/8 cup of water from each leg and it dripped all over the cocktail sauce and food.  Now the shrimps on the other hand were delicious as was the raw salmon with capers and red onion as sides to put on a bagel.  In fact most people probably didn't notice the small pieces of smoked trout and yellowfin tuna by the salmon but they were excellent.  

There were lots of selections including prime rib for breakfast if you prefer meat.  The rice congee was bland but nice if you have a hangover.  The dim sum looked stale.  The cheese was alright but only a couple selections offered.  There was Asian food and the thin egg noodle chow mien was good.  I enjoyed the mixed fruit salad with or without a light cream sauce.  There were lots of breads and some crackers.  I tried nearly every one of the 7 or 8 small desert bites.  A couple were delicious like the mini Pecan Pie or the cheesecake.  The Tiramisu cake wasn't worth the two bites offered.  I really like the small portion idea since I hate to waste food.

I was really looking forward to this part of the weekend, so I stuck it out. Turns out it wasn't so bad. The people in front of me were nice. The people behind me weren't very chatty, but they seemed like nice people. The casino had people give us water every so often, and even people who handed out toys to the kids because it was Christmas day. Well done Bellagio, well done. They were giving back to the people in line. Granted. The toys and water weren't worth fifty two dollars, but still. The thought and gesture was there.
     Two hours actually passed fairly quickly. Before I knew it, I found myself paying for my ticket. I was then seated at a two person table next to another single occupant two person table with a nice gentlemen from Venezuela.  He assured me that the buffet was absolutely worth the wait and price tag. We chatted between trips up to the buffet room. He had a large mound of partially eaten crab legs on some plates at his table.
     Venezuelan neighbor was right. Each trip up to the buffet was incredible. The amount of food and cooking and talent put into the items was amazing. Even the pizza. The pizza was made with truffles. The crappy pizza you feed to your kids because they don't eat anything weird. Truffles. It was downright amazing. I even attempted an Alaskan King Crab leg. Never having had one before, I'm sure I looked like an idiot while eating it. Also amazing.
      Since I had been in line for two hours, I did my best to stay just as long as I could. After an hour of eating nearly all of God's creatures prepared in incredible and assorted delectable ways, I simply couldn't eat any more. The desserts were as beautiful as they were tasty. I savored each bite as long as I could.
     The Bellagio was highly recommended on yelp as the 'most Christmas' of all the casinos. With their amazing Holiday display in the conservatory, I tend to agree. This place is great. Even after two hours and sixty dollar price tag.",3,0,0

We went for Saturday Brunch which was about $34, but came out to $42 with tax and mandatory 18% gratuity for our party of 9. We also came at the end of lunch to get those prices, but then transitioned to dinner menu which was fantastic.

Experience & Service: 5\/5 - Overall a great experience. The servers here are always very attentive and nice. Even though drinks were self service, they brought us drinks and refilled for us. They were always quick to take our plates when we were finished so we had room for more.

Food & Taste: 5\/5 - We came at the end of lunch so we were also able to get dinner food. This was the ONLY buffet that had poke!! Maybe this is a new thing and other buffets are now doing it, but this is the first one I've seen. Their sushi selection isn't amazing but at least they had salmon and tuna nigiri. As far as the other food goes, they have great variety and quality of food.

Value: 5\/5 - In my opinion, this is one of the higher tier and quality buffets at a lower end price. Other ones like Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal are way overpriced for what they deliver in my opinion. Bellagio is a good balance of price and quality, which ends up a great value.

Overall, my favorite buffet on the strip. Good balance of quality, value, variety, and service. Would highly recommend.",9,0,0

They have a good variety from juices, oatmeal, pancakes, meats, pastries, fruit and on and on, all very well prepared, hot and cold as appropriate, and tasty.  Really more than we middle agers could eat but well worth the $38 tab for two.

The service, however, leaves much to be desired, beginning with  the hostesses seating people, and to a lesser extent, the waitperson at the table.  The hostesses were haughty, unsmiling, unfriendly, bordering on plain rude, all of which is so unnecessary.  An old gentleman wandered up one of the two unoccupied entrance lines only to be rudely told it was reserved for line pass people and turned away back around to the regular line.  Fortunately, our line was very short and not a wait.  Common courtesy could have received this oldster with much more welcoming attitude, but apparently such is in short supply among hostesses.  Our table waitperson seemed competent but not particularly friendly, either.

Went back for Sunday breakfast at 7:30 am to find the full $54 brunch for two was in effect, with roast beef, all manner of fish dishes, boiled shrimp, ham, etc. along with traditional breakfast items as mentioned above.  Really, roast beef at 7:30 in the AM?

I felt that the food selection was a little weak and the flavors and quality on the low end of the scale.  The only thing that made up for the lack of good hot food was the amazing dessert bar, which featured some insanely good desserts.

Honestly, I can't remember much of what I had, because most of it tended to be over-cooked.  The only thing that was really good was the fresh lamb\/beef gyros, which were carved straight off the rotating, vertical spit.  Unfortunately, the meat was ready only every 10-15 minutes (an eternity at a buffet) and there wasn't much of it each time they carved it.  You had to be fast, or the meat would run out.  Extra points for having mini-pitas and a full bar of condiments, such as sliced tomatoes, lettuce, tzatziki, and crumbled feta cheese.  I also appreciated their sushi bar, which had tuna poke and tuna sashimi, which was fresh and very good.    

Bellagio's carving station offered a large variety of meats, from the standard prime rib and lamb to more ""exotic"" fare, such as bison and beef wellington, which later turned into chicken wellington.  I tried the prime rib, the bison, and the beef wellington, all of which were lacking in flavor.  The prime rib was a tad overdone, even from the center, and the seasoning, which made for a good tasting crust, didn't penetrate to the center of the meat.  The bison and beef wellington were both tough and over-cooked.  It was my first time trying bison and while I think it had potential, it was just too tough for me to enjoy.  Likewise, the beef wellington, which had a good pastry crust, was too dry.

And now for the desserts, which were all delicious.  The creme brulee, which I had 3 of (yes, I know, I'm a pig), came with a perfectly crisp, carmelized crust, which I delighted in cracking with my spoon.  Delicious.  Next up was a key lime pie - it was deliciously tart and smooth.  Likewise, the lemon meringue pie was amazing, with a nicely browned meringue on top.  There were other desserts as well, all of which were good, presumably because the man behind Jean Philippe Patisserie is overseeing all the desserts at the Bellagio.

All in all, an okay buffet.  The desserts were outstanding, but the other foods were a disappointment.  If you can eat $35+ worth of pastries and perhaps nibbles of sushi, gyro, cocktail shrimp, and pasta, then Bellagio is the place to go.  Otherwise, for a more complete, overall Vegas buffet experience, I would head out to the Wynn, Paris, or Mandalay Bay.",1,0,2

They also had a station where they cooked-to-order a dish made of seafood, vegetables, and puff pastry with a cream sauce.  Other notable items were the pesto mashed potatoes and the lobster ravioli.  I also really like their pre-made salad station--I tried the one with mixed greens, pecans, cranberries, and a maple dressing, and it was so good that I would have been happy just eating that the whole time.  Their dessert selection is just out of this world, but unfortunately I was too full to try any!

One downside for me was the price, which ended up being $45 after tax and gratuity (automatic 18% gratuity added for parties of 8 or more).  The other downside, which some may disagree with, is how they split the crab legs for you.  I, personally, like having the experience of working through crab legs.

- Juice is fresh and good, similar to Tropicana from super market.

- Seafood: the crab legs are crap. Thin, small, salty, and they are still frozen. The shrimp with cocktail sauce, on the other hand, is of very decent size and freshness. 

- Pizza and pasta: tried a bit of each. They are decent tasting, just a tad better than the Papa Johns and Olive Gardens of your city. 

- Prime rib: extremely so so. No flavour and overcooked. No idea what people are talking about when they say ""juicy and best prime rib I've eaten""... any neighborhood steakhouse should do it better.

- Italian (a couple different pastas)
- carving station (prime rib, lamb, turkey, chicken wellington - all not that tasty and some overcooked)
- desserts (soft serve ice cream, carrot cake, eclairs, cream puffs, etc.) - none all too exciting
- salads (variety)
- breads and soups

There was a wide selection of weekend brunch buffet food but none this time that wowed me. They used to have the most amazing and buttery seabass that melted in your mouth. But none this time - only some slightly overcooked halibut, salmon, and grouper. They used to have juicy, tender, and large pieces of prime rib - but today it was small, rather overcooked and not as flavorful. They used to offer various cheeses with bread but apparently they have cutback on that too. They used to have lots of delicious scones which they don't offer anymore.  There was nothing I ate today that wow'ed me and made me want to stuff one more last bite because it was that good. 

Bottom line: Overall still a good buffet but it seems to be a lot more ordinary now and may not be worth the $23.95 price compared to other available buffet options. I think they have definitely skimped from what it was in the past. If you have to pay ~$25 for a weekend brunch buffet, I'd rather go to the Spice Market buffet in the Planet Hollwood casino (which was great) or maybe check out the Wynn Buffer (have not tried that yet). And you may not have to wait in the ridiculous line.",1,0,1

The legs, which are usually King Crab, were small and looked like snow crab to me.  They only had one crab station and you literally had to wait about 10-15 mins before your turn.  The rest of the buffet was a mess and not cleaned during my experience.  It honestly looked like a Golden Corral to me.  Many of the items were not replaced quickly, resulting in a wait for the chefs to replace the food.  The ice cream machine was empty and no effort was made to correct this issue.  Unfortunately, for the price, I was completely disappointed as I have always had good experiences for dinner.

We arrived a little before 3pm on a Friday for the buffet and did not have to experience any waiting lines and were promptly seated. Our waitress promptly took our drink orders shortly after we were seated.  

Started out with some salads, peeled shrimp and sushi.  They were good but nothing special.  They have snow crab legs, but at 3:30pm they start bringing out the dinner items and that includes crab legs. These were a lot better than the snow crab legs.

I usually gravitate towards to the carving station at buffets.  The slices of beef and the beef wellington were disappointing to say the least.  Both were medium well and were on the dry side.  The wellingtons that were on the carving station were all at the same medium well doneness.  Wow, shouldn't you have different doneness to satisfy the different palates?

The desserts were the best part of my meal.  With a decent selection, they were in most part pretty good.

The service was very good and efficient.  Our used plates were promptly removed from our table.

Overall, the food appears to have dropped in quality from our past visits.  For a couple of bucks more, the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's is worth it as it is in another class.

In terms of food, they were definitely better than average, but for what I paid, I was expecting more. The pasta didn't look very presenting and the mussels were tiny. Additionally, I found the turkey and chorizo nothing special. Admittedly, the pasta did taste better than it looked, and the snow crab was pre-cracked to make it easier to get the meat.

I love the Seaweed Salad, Beef Wellington, Crab and Shrimp.  It's been awhile since I have been but I wanted to weigh in.  

I love the Spice Market Buffet and the Rio Seafood Buffet as well.",0,0,0

Yes the price is cheaper for lunch but the qualify and the selection is a lot less as well.  They served flank steak and turkey at their carving stations and both cuts of meats were dry.  The sushi station is very limited to just veggie, California roll, and at request spicy tuna hand rolls.  The miso soup is really salty too.  The seafood menu is very limited too.  

I guess its still an above average buffet but I was disappointed as dinner here the last time was really good.",0,0,0

We visit this buffet everytime we are in Vegas.  Food quality does vary somewhat and hence the four stars and not five stars rating.  On good days, the king crab legs, jumbo shrimp cocktails, caviar (served on certain nights only), prime rib, and desserts are all wonderful.  We like their Chinese Food section of the buffet but really do not like the sushi section.   The rice to the sushi never quite tastes right.  I guess we have been spoiled by good sushi places in our neck of the woods.  So if you are looking for a huge varitey of food with some good mean seafood, give this buffet a try!",1,0,0

Went to Wynn next day and their buffet is much better with shorter line....won't bother here again.",0,0,0
