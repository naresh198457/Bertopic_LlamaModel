I spent a weekend here for my 30th birthday and was far from disappointed. My suite was in the newly renovated Rush Tower, which is sexy and exquisite. The staff was excellent, the room was great and the bed was insanely comfortable. 

There's some decent restaurants within the hotel, such as the Chart House and the Sushi joint near the Rush Tower. 

Also, um shark tank in the pool and a slide that goes through the shark tank?  Yes please. The pool is hard to get into, but that's most resorts in Vegas. Needless to say though, we still found spots without paying or making reservations and had a great time. The key in the pool is to hang out in the tunnel part behind the shark tank :)",4,1,2

I stayed here for Christmas weekend and thought they did a nice job. The heated pool is comfortable with the slide that goes throught the shark tank. Pretty fun. The room was in the Carson Tower which is the older of the two but the room was clean and comfortable. Service was fast and friendly with John, the manager of the poker room, doing an exceptional job at making people feel welcome and keeping the action going. This place feels like a strip hotel but with the options of downtown like not having to walk 2 miles to the next casino. The buffett was probably the best downtown...granted this is sort of like being the best water polo team in Alaska...but it's a buffett!!  Overall, a fine job by the staff...i'll be back.",0,0,0

We started off badly when we checked in there was a punk rock music festival going on right next door.  Most of the people attending were staying at the Golden Nugget so the line was long, the registration only had 2 people checking guests in.  We waited in like for almost a half hour.  When we got to the desk    the gentleman who checked us in was very polite and extremely helpful but when he gave us the room keys in the paper sleeve with the room number written on it he circled the Carson Tower instead of the Rush Tower.  We walked around the wrong tower for a half hour looking for a non existent room!  We kept asking staff where our room was and we kept getting sent in circles! They had no clue where our room was and didn't know enough to tell us we were in the wrong tower.  Finally we called the operator and were finally informed that the front desk clerk told us the right room but in the wrong tower.  The tower we were supposed to be in was on the complete opposite side of the Casino we had to walk another ten minutes in the other direction.  
After our hour long adventure of trying to check in which was absolutely frustrating, we arrived, our room was absolutely gorgeous and clean.  I was very happy with the room.  
We got settled and made our way to the pool.  unfortunately the aquarium water slide was closed which we were not informed of online when the room was booked or at check in.  The slide was the main reason we booked a room at the Golden Nugget.  The pool was crowded but understandable due to the festival, however, there was not enough staff to clean up.  The pool was littered with beer cans and plastic cups, there was trash and used pool towels left behind everywhere.  The water in the pool appeared clean but was very cloudy, but, we had no issues with the pool water.  The price on beverages was also pretty decent we ordered a 6 can beer bucket for $35 and a large pitcher of Margaritas for $44.  The pitcher was worth the price, 3 people split the pitcher and we each got about 2 full plastic cups each out of it.  It would be an absolutely excellent deal for 2 people or someone solo. 
Overall I was happy with the room but completely infuriated that we walked around for about 40 minutes looking for a room in the wrong place at the fault of the front desk clerk.  The pool would be much better if there was more staff to pick up around the pool area.  The hotel itself is beautiful and has a lot to offer and it's somewhere we would consider staying again.",0,0,0

The casino is nice and they have a lot of variety. We discovered after quite a bit of walking around that we did not find anything that wasn't in the casino\/hotel already. The pool was a lot of fun. The Adult pool on the third level is overrated. I went up there and it was asses and elbows. You couldn't walk in the pool it was so packed. Its just a waist high bathtub basically. I hope it circulates through a really good filter. The lower pool was really nice and most of the pool is in the shade. As the sun moves during the day, areas of the pool are in the sun, but the design of this pool is fun and if you don't want to put sunscreen on you don't have to. The shark tank slide was fun. It's entertaining for kids to. We should be able to bring beer in the can to the pool area. I understand no glass in the pool area but a few cans would not be the end of the world and would help loosen wallets to go to the bar.  Mixed drink prices were really high and the only affordable way to buy beer was in a bucket. 6 domestics for $30. Tip: go to the pool early and they'll give you an ice chest to keep your drinks cold. 
     The room was beautiful. We upgraded to the suite so it was spacious and offered plenty of room for guests to sit down with its living room area. The air conditioner was ice cold and the bed was really comfortable. The only room complaint was the noise from Fremont street (even on the 15th floor) it was loud. The biggest complaint: No electric outlets! Crazy right? There was a multi outlet behind the nightstand on my wife's side of the bed (that's how it became the wife side). But on my side there was nothing. Nothing by the bed or the wall adjacent to the bed. I used a usb port behind the clock on the night stand table (took all night to charge it was so slow), but I was not going to start pulling furniture out to see where the cord went. So in fairness I should say, there were zero exposed electric outlets except for one port on a multi outlet by my wife's side that poked out from behind the furniture. The nearest outlet was by the desk. My chargers wouldn't fit here because they are rectangular and the ports are in a drawer you open in the front. Nothing on any wall except behind the sofa (unplug the lamps), so ... you have to go all the way to the bathroom to charge your phone. I'm one of those people that likes their phone by me at night. 
     $30 for a refrigerator is a little outrageous. I'd say $10 tops but this is a nice hotel and it makes it look cheap when the room (especially a suite) does not include a refrigerator.  $15 to use the coffee machine in the room was a little crazy to. I read the note several times because I couldn't believe it. I thought, maybe it's $15 if it's damaged or something. NO. It's $15 for coffee. Never thought I'd say this but ... There's a Starbucks downstairs and it's cheaper ... barf ... I hate Starbucks but desperate times and all. We also didn't get slippers in our room. The check out time is 11am. They are not flexible on this so be ready. I called to try and get 1130 or 12 pm checkout so I could shower and shave after a long night, NO. Got down to the lobby at 11 to check out and they had one person working the counter and the line went from the counter to the door. I ended up checking out at 1120. Would have been nice to shave with all the time they had me in line. 
    There's plenty of eating options. And of course you have Fremont Street nearby. The resory fee of $31.08\/night just kills me. We should be able to show that we ate and drank at the casino\/hotel and get that waved. I dropped a lot of money at the pool area bar and restaurants during my stay and it's the feeling of getting nickel and dimed that ruins a 5 star experience.  Without the fridge charge and resort fee i would have ignored the othe stuff and made this 5 stars. I might add or subtract from this later but for now ... enjoy. Overall it was a very positive experience even though we lost big at the casino ... hahaha",1,0,0

Most of the times we play black jack and craps. Guys who deal this games are always friendly and cheerful. So even if we loose, we don't feel bad because at least we had a great time. 
Recently we started playing Pai Gow there. Since the first time, we have been very disappointed with dealers at those tables. Most of the times we were not greeted. When we were asking some questions the response was all the time with attitude. We got used to that when we hit something, dealers are always cheerful, but I guess not at this game. It feels like they are giving the money from their pocket when they are paying. NEVER!!!! smiling! The biggest disappointment was when we tipped the dealer(even though we lost) and there was no ""thank you"" or smile. She just grabbed the money without even looking at us. We both work in the industry and know that tips are part of their ""salary"", so at least they could appreciate the effort.
So from now on we just don't take our guests from out of town there",0,0,0

The Nugget is on top of Fremont.. Checked in on the Rush tower side (stay there if you can) much less crowded since everyone checks in on the lower priced side and can check in to what ever room your in  much quicker! Plus looking at the giant aquarium gives the rest of your party something to look at while your filling out your info. The room  (we upgraded to the Gold Tower) was a nice size, attractive color scheme, average appointment's. Flat screen, but cable and wi - fi are xtra. Bed was super comfortable, stayed at Sheraton a week before and there was a suprising no comparison to the bed's and Sheraton was more expensive! The pool was fine, sure you may have to get there early, but that goes with just about every hotel in Vegas right? The water slide was super fun, had to wait a bit but again summer in Vegas all you do is wait for just about everything. I suggest you rent a daybed or Cabana upstairs in the H2O adult's area only if sittin by the pool is your Vegas style vaca. Lot's of families so it's well worth the $ and effort to stay in the H20 area. We hit the pool only once and got lucky, I found a chair  right away while the BF played crap's. After we swam, we sat at the poolside Blackjack table. I'm not a gambler and the empty $3 table was inviting. Won $100.00  and the dealer was super cool about my amature status! Didn't eat  at the restaurant's so can't rate them. The hotel over all is quite attractive and the staff was mostly super friendly. I have to give major prop's to the valet guy's! They took care of us!!! If you call ahead for your car by a 1\/2 hour, they will have it ready to go for you when you come down. Otherwise if you have them get it  while you wait, be prepared. They are very busy and it seemed only 2 or 3 valet's were there at any give time.  They were cool about the call ahead and it was nice just going from air con hotel to air con car, Vegas in July ya feel me! The only down fall to this whole experience was the house keeping or lack thereof... First full day room was not made up at all. The hotels policy is to change the sheet's every other day which is fine. But we came back the first full day (at 01:00 ) and the room was not made up i.e. bed not made,crap on the floor and no clean towels. Called housekeeping, they were willing to come and fix room but at the early morning hour I just wanted to drop into my unmade bed. Next day and rest of stay ( 5 day's) used water glasses not replaced, cocktail glasses not removed and garbage that missed the can still on floor  hotel robes not  hung up ( I picked up after us). Toilitries replaced once. So basically housekeeping consisted of making the bed and replacing towel's. Maybe I was expecting too much of the housekeeping dept? All in all it was fine, yes the bathroom is small but how much of your vaca do you really spend in there? And yes the pool was crowded, but your not the only person that know's of this hotel. It's super popular with families. And one last thing, this location is best if you have a car. It's pretty far from the strip and the Sahara is the closest hotel with the monorail access and it's quite a distance if you walk. The area around  the Nuggetl is sketch but after driving around the area's of Las Vegas near the bigger hotels their  sketch too! Just don't go looking for trouble.",0,0,0

Some people had been telling me how it was a very old hotel and how Fremont St was nowhere near the Strip so I was worried but to my pleasant surprise the hotel was amazing! We had booked a room in the Rush tower, which was very spacious and beautiful. The pool was great and the Tank was sooooo cool! I loved the slide although you go REALLY fast thru the Tank so it was a little hard to see the sharks and fish. The pool was a bit small for how big the hotel is, and our biggest problem there was finding a chair to put our stuff down on. Other than that it was great. The buffet was really good as well and pretty well priced for what they offer. The casino had a variety of slots and card games, however I only play slots so I cant speak for the card games really. The Fremont Street area pleasantly surprised me, too. I was worried at first about being far from the Strip, but after a night on the Strip, my friends and I were all ready to go back to Fremont St! Its a fun area with much less walking than the Strip and better prices for food and drinks, too. The only real problem we had at the GN was we had booked a room for 4 people with 2 queen beds. However when we got there, they told us they only had rooms with king beds left in the Rush tower. We really wanted to stay in that tower, so we asked them to please bring us 2 cots at least since they couldn't provide us with the amount of beds we needed, and they said they could only bring 1. We were kind of upset about this because we had paid for a room that would have beds for everyone and instead someone had to sleep on the couch.

First we called the front desk and the rude woman said we could stay another night but it would cost us. The rate she gave us was more than double our reservation rate. We were told  to go to the front desk. Once there we spoke to the manager and he stated our reservation was only til noon today.  With our email confirmation we got everything fixed and went to our room. (The check is not near our tower).... Once to our room we found we were locked out.  Back at registration we were informed we were probably locked out because our keys were too close to a cell phone. We returned to our room with new keys which of course didn't work. We ran across an employee whom made a call and new keys would be brought to us.  25 minutes later we called the front desk from our cell. Spent ten minutes waiting for the manager. Once on the phone he said he would bring up new keys. After mentioning that we have spent the last 2 hrs dEaling with this he offered 2 free breakfast buffets.

Overall it was fine. We were upgraded to the Gold Tower, and the room was a good size and had modern furnishings. However, there were some things that spoiled it for me and made it seem not up to ""4 star caliber"", in our room (1533):

The faucet on the inside bathroom wasn't set correctly. It turned a full 180 degrees to operate, and you had to get it just right to get it to stop running. 

The maid who cleaned our room put the bathroom rug in the tub (to wash it??), but LEFT it there in standing water. So the tub was not only still dirty, now we had a soaking wet rug to contend with. 

The maid also didn't take a drinking glass away from the night before, so there was lots of ""ice sweat"" on the nightstand that I didn't notice until I put my iPhone down it. 

There is only one hook on the bathroom door to hang a towel or a robe. That's it. No towel bar or hooks anywhere else in the shower area!

We came back from the pool and someone was in out room. They stole :
Powerbank
Boom Box
Jewlery .....all my beloved jewlery 
Sunglasses
German Passport
Creditcard
Fishing knive 

I have to admit that we didnt use the safe.
But I think it was someone who worked there. How can you get in the rooms without a chipcard 

The Golden Nugget didnt really care and I think its Not happening for the First time.

Not a safe Hotel at all.

A few general notes about all the hotels and Fremont street. They have perfected the art of parting you from your money.

Booking was a bit of a nightmare. We called to book the room while we were en route and we got a Gold Tower suite and was told that there were two beds. Well we arrived late and ready to knock out then realized that sofa was just a sofa. Not a sofa bed! So after dealing with the front desk we ended upgrading to the Gold Club Tower room and I'm so glad that we did!

The Gold Club Tower is awesome. Right when you exit the elevator upon getting to the room you are greeted with a mini bar full of candies, nuts, apples and water. It was really cool to the kids and I'm not going to lie... I liked it as well. The complimentary waters came in handy during the day. We were also able to bring them down to the pool with us.

 The best thing about Golden Nugget is its shark pool. My kids would have been happy as clams just staying at the hotel and playing there. Unfortunately it was cold and really windy, so windy the pool had to be closed a couple of times.

The rooms were really nice. You can still catch a whiff of cigarette smoke despite them being smoke-free because, hey, you're in Las Vegas. 

I didn't like how they didn't have many places to eat inside. Two or three restaurants were built but closed and had signs that said something like, ""Coming soon (hopefully)."" They do have a buffet and they gave us some 50% off coupons. Go early to the breakfast buffets because there's a long line. They also have a Starbucks inside, near the pool. 

I didn't like the location much. Downtown, despite the ""Fremont Street Experience,"" is still pretty gritty. My older kid was covering my younger kid's eyes a lot. There are a lot of street performers or costumed people hanging out and posing for pics, and some were really not trying, like an ate-up looking man in a very dirty (like, actual dirt) drag costume with no make up on. Another was a man in a thong and a cowboy hat. A couple of showgirls were hanging out and they had the most clothes on. Ha. I didn't expect it to be totally sanitized, but the area is still pretty seedy.

About the super smoky comment, I have become extremely sensitive to cigarette smoke in recent years and I didn't find it too bad. Not as clean as Venetian, which reeks of marigold-scented Renuzit in my opinion, and some on the Strip, but certainly tolerable, even by me. Maybe I was there on a low-smokers Saturday?

The casino and pool areas are among the  nicest features within the building and all of the bars are located in areas in which one truly feels the excitement and energy of downtown Las Vegas.

The price of rooms, drinks, and food are quite reasonable when compared to other hotels and one can easily spend an entire day if not their entire stay just at this one hotel. It's placement on the old strip makes it easy to venture out and explore all that Fremont Street has to offer.

Having not stayed in the new tower the few critiques of the Nugget would be that the rooms and the interconnecting hallways, although still quite nice, do feel a bit dated and somewhat  dark or dim when it comes to lighting (natural or artificial). Also entering the pool at peak hours can be a bit off putting due to the large amount of children and adults coming and going while likely not showering between bathroom visits. This is definitely not a pool for swimming and be sure to get there early to get your spot on a recliner.  Adult pool goers should definitely check out the upper level pool as it has an awesome atmosphere, great music, and far fewer mystery particles in the water.

My second time in Vegas.  The First time I stayed at Paris.  This trip out I stayed 8 days at MGM Grand and then 1 day at The Golden Nugget.  I wanted to see downtown LV.  I have to say this was the best day of the whole trip.  The service here was unbeatable, esp. compared to every place on The Strip.  The employees actually like their jobs, they care about you and they go out of their way to show you just this,

My favorite part was the AMAZING OUTDOOR POOL!  Three Pool areas, a jacuzzi, private cabanas, cushioned clean and covered chaise chairs.  The 3 story high water slide goes right through the HUGE shark tank!  Very kid friendly too.  Private adult pool for those looking for more quiet atmosphere.  The room was 100 plus tax.  Can't beat this price anywhere in Vegas.  The room didn't have a coffee pot, a fridge or a microwave (BUT NO HOTEL IN VEGAS DOES!!!) The room was newly updated- nice bed, huge flat screen tv, great view, cozy.  

The buffet was better than the MGM buffet by FAR!  When checking in, we received 2 Buy one, get one Buffets.  The price is already half that of the Strip Buffets.  I felt you got a lot for the price.  

Gnotto, restaurant, VERY GOOD!  The Wedding Cake is a must have!

I honestly cannot say a single bad thing about this hotel.  After my experience all week at the MGM and multiple places along the Strip, I was ready to leave and never come back to LV.  This hotel has changed my perspective and I will def. be staying here again if  and when I come back to Sin City.

In addition you can use the concierge service, VIP check-in (that actually acts like VIP check-in - as in, you go into a lounge to get checked in as opposed to schlepping through a line like everyone else). 

The casino floor gets jammed, there are a lot of smokers, and the clientele tends to be *cough* fairly old, but other than those slight downsides, it's a lovely old hotel. 

The pool is fantastic, with a super fun water-slide that goes through a SHARK TANK! How can you not love it? 

Last but not least, I highly recommend renting one of the cabanas at the Hideout Pool on top of the hotel for the day. The cabana is only $100 for the day and they have very reasonable bottles.

I like the convenience of this hotel since its right on Fremont Street plus where the valet is located, it's really easy to get onto the strip or freeway. The Premium Outlet is really close to it as well. The rooms are nice and spacious even for the Carson Tower. Stayed in the Rush Tower once because we were upgrade. The front desk checked us into a room that was already occupied! Luckily nobody was in the room at the time and we hurriedly got out of there and back downstairs. We were upgraded to a junior suite! 

Housekeeping didn't make up our room on our last night, not a biggie. I'm a big girl I can make my own bed but we were in need of tissue, toiletries and towels. So I call housekeeping and speak to Carol. Told her that our room was never serviced and she says ""ok?"" and doesn't say anything else. I tell her what we need and she said someone will bring it up. Well we never got it. We were getting ready to go out & was in the room for a couple of hours but still nothing. We called before we left and asked them to just put it in the room since we were leaving. Returned at 3am and guess what? Nothing.

For the most part, maid service was good though. Hotel staff was friendly and always called out a greeting when we walked by. The timeshare ppl are a bit annoying. They'll stop you and ask you how long you're going to be there, if you want to see a free show etc. Sometimes they kept walking along side us even though we kept saying ""no thank you"". I get it's their job & they don't remember everyone they've approached but dude, you've approached us like 10 times in the past hour. My sassy friend tells the man this too. Finally on our last day, he remembered and just smiled and waved to us as we walked by. 

Def didn't enjoy the evacuation alert at 2am one night. Was just about to jump in the shower when this loud alarm goes off & we were told to evacuate immediately due to an emergency in the building. This announcement is blaring and being repeated over and over. Heart racing, I run out of the bathroom butt ass naked. Scramble to get my jeans on, stumbling as I'm trying to get into my jeans only to realize I'm trying to put my jeans on the wrong leg, practically ate the floor from hopping around. Throw on my t-shirt which my friend points out is inside out and backwards. At this point I don't care. I'm on the 21rst floor of a 22 story building. The only emergency I can think of is...FIRE...and this girl doesn't care how she looks (yes I just talked in 3rd person) she's getting out of there with an inside out & backward shirt.

As we're heading to the stairs I notice people walking in the opposite direction. The stairwell was right next to our room but everyone who was on our floor was walking to the farthest stairwell which is about 2 long hallways away. My friend calls out that the stairs are closer ""this way"". Notice an elderly couple so we wait for them thinking we might have to help them down 21 flights of stairs. Right when they get to the stairwell, the alert is canceled and we're told we can return to our rooms. Some people were in the stairwell and didn't hear it so my friend called out to them. I think Golden Nugget should put speakers or something in the stairwell. If we didn't wait for the elderly couple we would've been in the stairwell and wouldn't have heard the cancellation and would've walked down 21 flts of stairs. Yea, so I needed to cardio but not at 2am.

Aaand it doesn't end there. We get back into our room. Start disrobing to take my shower when the damn blaring alert goes off AGAIN! My friend sticks her head out the door and sees people coming out of their room and walking towards the stairwell. I put my shoes back on. When we go into the stairwell, security was there and told us to hold on because he was pretty sure it was an false alarm. After getting the all clear he sends everyone back to their rooms. He tells us that someone was smoking on our floor which is a nonsmoking floor and it set off the alarm. A word to the wise. If you get caught, it's a $250 fine so get your lazy butt in the elevator and go down to the lobby or...gasp...here's a thought pick a smoking room. Also, I know this is cliche but seriously check where the stairwell is when you check into any hotel, you never know when you might have to actually evacuate.

The Golden Nugget is a recommended hotel. There's a swimming pool with a huge shark tank that seems to be quite popular as the pool was always crowded. I didn't get the chance to check it out though. There are a few restaurants and even a Starbucks...2 actually but 1 is open 24 hours.",10,8,6

The Golden Nugget's swimming pool was listed in the top 10 list of the world's greatest swimming pools. The center of the pool featured an enormous aquarium that housed sharks! As if that was not enough, people can slide through the shark tank in a water slide. I knew that if I ever visit Vegas, I had to stay at the Golden Nugget simply for the pool.

The pool was definitely fun. I easily spent over 4 hours there swimming, playing on the slide and people watching. You can't exactly swim because the pool is completely infested with children. Some of the sandbar sharks have injuries to their noses from bumping into the sides of their tank.  Poor guys. The shark tank looked spectacular but it is overstocked. 

We stayed in one of the penthouse apartments on the 18th floor. Internet access costs and additional $12.99. Despite the enormous space, there was no kitchen, no microwave, and no sofa bed.  My buddy and I had to share the same bed. Lame....",2,4,1

Good thing I had some febreeze handy.  Also, although the tub was really nice the draining was unbelieveably slow.  You might as well take a bath because after a few minutes of the shower being on the water was above my ankles.  Other than that I had a great stay.

He then took the report and photos of my phone with date and time stamps where I had taken pictures and he left.  I was gathering my things to leave and before I could even get out of the room, housekeeping was banging on the door ready to turn the room over so they could put someone else in the same room.

At first they weren't going to give us rooms side-by-side, even though we both made the request a few times over the phone prior....But we asked for our rooms to be switched once we saw they were far apart...and without hesitation, they fulfilled our request.

We stayed in the newly renovated Rush tower.  It was very clean, and very nice.  Personally, I liked the masculine decor, although it was a bit dark.  However, the darkness made for a fantastic sleeping environments during sunny mornings.
The bed was really comfortable, and the bathroom had a separate toilet room for extra privacy.  

The pool was really clean.  And it was really cool to see the sharks.
The chair area wasn't too sunny....and it got too chilly to swim, but February is off-season.

I really can't say anything bad about the accomodations...if you want to stay downtown, this is a great place to stay.  It opens directly onto Freemont Street which rocks on all night.

Keep in mind that it's approx. $15-$20 to take a cab to the strip....forget the bus....it's too slow.  The best parts about staying Downtown is that it's cheaper to do eat, drink, gamble, rent a cabana, etc.  The people watching is absolutely priceless....
And what I liked about it the most, is that it constantly surprised me...it made me NOT ""judge a book by its cover""...I relied heavily on Yelp for restaurant suggestions which led me to seedy looking exteriors with awesome food.

I stayed at the Golden Nugget, and this place blew my expectations away!

On second thought, erase that thought entirely as it's rather creepy, and just read the rest of this review.

Even through the various ownership changes over the past years, the Nugget still remains one of the best hotel deals in Vegas hands down. I never understood why people stay at complete dumps like the Flamingo and Circus Circus instead of staying at a really nice, clean hotel for less. I have never seen a filthy bathroom at the Nugget (even in the public areas) and from some of the sights I've seen in Vegas, that means a lot. The restaurants inside serve good meals at reasonable prices, and the spa is quite nice to boot. The amenities are not particularly extravagant a la Four Seasons, but clean, pleasant, and reasonably priced. 

Now the down side (and isn't there always one?) - the Nugget is a beautiful oasis located in the armpit of Downtown. Now, now, I'm not hating on Downtown - it's actually a nice change from the blingy Strip. But once you get over the cutoff jean shorts\/cowboy boots\/mega-mullet people watching, you might feel a bit trapped.

The Nugget has undergone renovations in the past year, adding the infamous shark pool and facelifting some of the restaurants. The pool renovation was amazing - the area is still a little cramped, but much nicer than the pool area at the Paris casino. The casino has added a nice cocktail lounge as well although the decor borders on the douchy Maxim side.

When I got married in Vegas a few years ago, I booked a block for my guests at the Nugget. I wouldn't say the sales staff is particularly attentive, but now that they've added a chapel perhaps they are more receptive to weddings.

If you're Vegas-bound and looking for a pleasant off-Strip experience, I highly recommend the Nugget - however you may want to rent a car for the times you want to escape the Downtown insanity.",2,1,1

a non smoking room close to an elevator. My husband has bad hips and breathing problems. Well, they do not understand the meaning of reservation. RESERVATION
means ( an arrangement to have something held for one's use at a later time; also a promise, ) When we arrived they were out of non smoking rooms. They were not even apoplectic about it. They said it was first come first serve. I asked them if that means someone who just arrives in town a can walk in and get a non smoking room
They said yes. And they don't take reservations. Then why did the take our money, a
month ahead of time. Since it was 9 pm and we were tired from our flight we had to
take a smoking room. They sent up someone to spray the rooms.( We had 2 rooms).
That lasted about 1 hour. Our rooms smelled really bad. I don't think these rooms were used often. I can't believe even a smoker could stand the smell.

I finally got the chance due to a special rate...not a wise choice.  Granted I stayed at the old tower but it seemed a little run down.  The room was very mediocre and had a weird smell. I can't believe there was no fridge! I just felt like I was getting nickled and dimed all over the place....internet ($12.99 per day\/per device), gym ($20.00 per day). I think I would just preferred it all getting rolled up into a resort fee. 

The only reason I gave it 1 star is because the pool was pretty cool with the fish\/shark tank and the big slide.  However, the patrons there were not cool.  There was already a long line to go on the slide and people kept cutting in line...ummm...ok. It just felt too over crowded and not fun.

Also, we had a really bad experience with the elevator. One the day that we checked out. There were a whole bunch of people in the elevator (maybe like 8-10 people). Me and my man friend were the last people to get off the elevator. However, as we were getting off, the elevator started going back up...with the doors OPEN! OMG....Golden Nugget....if you're reading this...this is a HUGE LIABILITY!! Can you imagine what would've happened if someone got caught in the elevator just as it s going back up?!?

Security is really good but that's because they get a lot of experience dealing with people who need to be kicked out. In all seriousness, they are very good and seem to have a lot to do.  

On the flip side of that scale is the housekeeping.
When I got to my room all seemed fine, I saw the courtesy card left on the desk informing me that I was staying in a room maintained by the dedicated housekeeping staffer, Dina Chacon.  I must not have read the back of the card that explained why Dina selected me as the special recipient of the previously tenants clothing deviantly placed\/left behind my chairs nor did it let me know that the previous tenant left a message on the bathroom mirror informing me of ""Hombres, somethin, somethin"".  All symptoms of NOT cleaning the room that then made me question if it was ""maintained"" at all. 

Apart from that awesome feeling, when checking in I paid an extra charge to get one of the ""newly renovated room"" for my stay. Then after visiting the rooms of the other people in our party realized that their rooms were exactly the same as mine and they did not have to pay extra. 

Service is not a necessarily a positive attribute, cleanliness is not necessarily a positive attribute and feeling taken advantage of at the front desk is not necessarily a positive attribute.

cons:
- shuttle drops you off at a side location and you're greeted by what you think is someone that will check you in, but it has nothing to do with check in, it's a time share spiel. 
- there are many time share people throughout the hotel casino that are constantly wanting you to stop and talk with them. 
- the carson rooms are unfortunately not the nicer renovated rooms, so the tub would occasionally get clogged and the room overall looked outdated and sections of the carpet were wet (wtf?)
- the carson room we stayed in has a view of the street, where there is a pretty big parking lot, where chris daughtry decided to have a really loud concert for what seemed like 20 hours! (maybe 2.5 - 3). 

pros: 
- really big hotel
- 2 starbucks in the hotel, plus claim jumper, and many other nice restaurants, including vic & anthony's steakhouse 
- on Fremont Street, which is pretty awesome
- huge 3 (or 4) level pool, centered around a shark tank!

Most of our family heads that way annually to blow off some steam and soak up some sun after our long Minnesota winter. I really have had some great times in this hotel. That being said it seems like with each passing year the customer service here slips a little more and the ways they use to get an extra dollar from you goes up more each year.

The VIP check in service is now only for customers who reserve a suite. If I was willing to pay the additional fee to check in early why in the world would they take that away? There is a daily fee if you would like a refrigerator in you room of $25.00. Wi-Fi you say $20.00 if you want that. Do you prefer not to get up at 8:00 in the morning to sit in a chair in the shade by the pool to make sure you have a spot for the day? Well then that will be anywhere from $35.00 to $300.00 a day (NO REFUNDS) for a chair, daybed or cabana rental.

Have a question or want to order room service? It's a crap shoot. You may get someone friendly and helpful or you may get (as we did several times) someone who really could not care less what you need. Several times I got the feeling that we were a major inconvenience when we called for room service.

Several of our party stayed in the Carson tower because, shame on us, we are smokers. I know filthy habit but for now that's the way it is. The rooms in this tower are just o.k. I don't think there has been any effort at all to modernize or update in a very long time. I realize it's not going to smell like a field of wildflowers or anything but geez talk about outdated. On top of that every time you head to you elevators you are zeroed in on by the people trying to sell you time share. These people are not at the Gold tower entrance and I have never seen them at the Rush tower. Apparently the smokers are the only ones who deserve this harassment. After the fifth or sixth time believe me it feels like harassment.

We rented a daybed for ""four"" people. Four people if you sit. Do not plan on laying down and catching rays. The circular bed will not fit four adults unless you sit. I knew this going in so not a big deal. Our waitress was there right away trying to push bottle service. I know it's their job but I do not need a $200.00 bottle of vodka and all the pop and water we want. After that the jumbo drinks were heavily pushed. We indicated that we would like the regular size drinks as the large ones tend to melt or get warm before they can be consumed. That should have been enough  but each and every time  we ordered another the larger more expensive drinks were pushed.

In general the service has gone way way down. The quality has gone down.  The prices on the other hand continue to climb. We have always been loyal to the Nugget as we have always had a lovely experience. The last few years however have not been anything special and the expense continues to rise. For the first time in many years I believe that our next family vacation we will be patronizing another establishment.",2,0,0

When I pulled up and got out to help unload, I noticed the bell hop wasn't noticing that they needed a cart so I spotted one and went over to bring it. Maybe it wasn't my job. Okay. But that's not the issue. The issue is this. When the bell hop saw me at the cart he came over and asked, ""Are you the driver?"" and I said, ""yes."" Then, here's the part where it all went south, he says to me in a super condescending, snarky way, ""I got this."" and gave me one of those pats on the shoulder.

I was just trying to help my riders, and help the bell hops as a matter of fact since they failed to notice the need for a luggage cart. So I said, ""You don't have to be a dick, dude. I'm just trying to help."" and he dismissed me by just saying, ""Thank you."" So I called him out for being an even bigger dick. And he kept on just dismissing me.

I love the downtown area and all the excitement and the ability to get from one hotel to another without having to walk miles. You have all the great neighboring hotels and of course the Fremont Street Experience is just that, an experience. Want to take a picture with a couple of cute Show Girls or a 300 lbs man in a thong, you can do both. Lots of music on the street: some from established bands on the stages and some from individuals putting a had out for a couple of coins [bills but you get the jest].

If you don't want to go out the Golden Nugget stands on its own. They have great bars all across the property but my favorite is the Rush Bar. Great music and lots of people watching and intermingling. Drinks are very reasonable [around $10 or less]. Since we were very interested in MLB playoffs we went to the Cadillac Tequila Bar which has lots of TV's all on sporting events and got to see the playoffs.

The pool area is amazing with a slide that goes through an aquarium. There are black jack tables and more out in the pool area for your viewing, I mean, playing experience. We stayed in the Gold Tower so gaming area is right there with plenty of tables and slots.

Our room, which was on the 16th floor was phenomenal and coffee and fruit was put out every morning near the elevators. Our room was huge and we were happy to see that there is an extra level of security. If you want to get up to that floor, you have to swipe your room key in the elevator.

The Pool was AWESOME!!!!! There are sharks how much more could you want. I do wish that they would check on the Sharks a little more though some of them looked super sad. But there are plenty of chairs and the water is warm. I love the slide. 

We only ate at the little diner place which closes kinda early for vegas times and the only 24 hour restaurant that they have is the clam jumper which was weird. But at the little dinner place I got a quesadilla and my guy got a hot dog so it was cheap and tasty. 

The Gamblin was good. We love playing blackjack on the cheap and they have a couple of $5 tables but those close kinda late considering it is Vegas again. On the weekdays I think they close at midnight and on weekends at 2:30. 

The drinks at the bar were kinda pricey so, my guy would have me run over to the Fremont and get drinks which were almost half the price of Golden Nuggets cause the drink girls hardly ever came around when you were playing so.

I've put a charge block on my card. Here's the saga on Vegas Chatter: http:\/\/www.vegaschatter.com\/story\/2012\/9\/4\/162713\/3521\/vegas-travel\/If+You+Stay+At+Golden+Nugget%2C+Keep+An+Eye+On+Your+Credit+Card+Statements

EDIT: So, I'm fresh back from my stay this weekend and here's the rest of the story.

A representative from The Golden Nugget called me on Friday and explained their billing software was not jiving well with AMEX and that's why the double charge again. He then told me I would receive $300 off the bill when I checked in.

Flash forward to Saturday (my check-in day) - my husband and I check-in with surly employees at the VIP lounge, go upstairs, have a lovely stay in our suite. 

Then we checked out this morning and THAT's where the issues come up.

The employee who checked me out informed me we were booked to stay until 9\/3. I replied to her that we had only booked one night. She then said, ""Well, whoever booked this online booked two nights. If you want to check out today there will be a $50 early check-out fee.""

I simply replied, ""No."" She did some typing and then, lo and behold, we didn't have to pay the fee anymore.

I am utterly AGHAST at the amount and degree of billing errors I have experienced in booking one night with The Golden Nugget. From reading other reviews here, I believe this to be a systemic and reoccurring issue in this casino and hotel. 

I'll be calling the number of the gentleman who promised me everything would be fine during my stay to alert him to this. Even though I received a reduced rate, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone give these people their billing information.
________________________________________ 

I wish I could give this hotel NO stars. 

The Golden Nugget has now charged me $530 TWICE for a stay I haven't even HAD yet! Watch your credit card if you decide to give them any of your information. 

The first time was when I originally booked my stay in July. I noticed a duplicate charge on my AMEX and called them about it. I was informed they had double charged almost everyone that day and were working on getting people refunds.

They did refund me but then...

On August 27 (two days ago), I received ANOTHER CHARGE for $530 on my AMEX from The Golden Nugget, THIS time it was filed under ""Specialty Retail,"" which a customer rep told me meant someone had charged my card in one of their shops. I haven't even stayed there yet, so this means someone has either taken down my info and used my card to charge something or they have a dangerous glitch in their accounting system.

I informed them of this and after more than 20 minutes on hold, I received NO apology, no compensation, nothing. They told me I have to talk to their accounting department. The hotel manager (Roxanne Yun) said they could do nothing for me and that she ""had no knowledge"" of the SECOND duplicate charge on my card.

Basically, they told me since it didn't show up on their screens (which, why would it? It's not attached to my reservation. It's a charge on my card from an unauthorized purchase in the gift shop.) it does not exist to them and they can do nothing for me.

I offered to send them statements, written instructions, etc. and she repeated to me that I would just have to talk to accounting. 

Again, I would not recommend you give these people your credit card information. I'm reporting them to the FTC tomorrow morning.",7,2,1

I've been coming to this hotel for YEARS.  Always had great service.  This was my first stay back in 2 years and I couldn't believe how poor it was.

First of all, the wait to check it was so long.  There was hardly anyone in line but there was only 2 check-in counters.  Not to mention- what's the point in having a check-in desk near the Carson Tower if it's ALWAYS CLOSED.

Second of all, the check-in girl was SO RUDE.  We asked if there were any upgrades available and she flat out said no- didn't even bother looking in the computer and I know for a fact that this wasn't a busy weekend because I booked the room a few days before.

The worst thing about this recent visit was parking.  There was NO PARKING even for hotel guests.  I don't know what was going on but the parking structure didn't even bother to put up the sign ""for hotel guests only"" until it was too late.  Even worse was the attitude we got from everyone.  The parking attendant was incredibly rude and said in a matter-of-fact-tone, ""well if you check the website, you'll see that parking isn't guaranteed.""  REALLY!?!  My bf spent the next 45 minutes driving around to the 'recommended' alternative parking structures at Four Queens and Binions.  They got mad at him because GN told him to try to park over there.  In the end, we had to pay for parking over at the ghetto Plaza lot.  Please explain to me why I, a hotel guest, should have to drive around the block several times then pay for parking at another hotel.  What is up with that?!?!

In addition, the lady at the 24 Karat club gave me an attitude when I requested a replacement card.  Again, I haven't been here in 2 years!  Now I am seriously wondering why I bothered to stay at GN... I am so disappointed in the staff and service.  The casino is also smoky and cramped- the sports bar lacks decent seating.

The only plus [and reason why GN gets ONE star from me] is that the rooms are pretty clean and nice for what you pay for.  HOWEVER!!! our room had mold and rust in the bathroom.  Pretty gross.

I have stayed a few times over the years here and usually in the Gold Tower on the  ""Gold Club Level""  as the extra privacy is always nice.
I rented 2 rooms as my daughter wanted to celebrate her birthday with friends.
Let me say, I see why they lost their 5 Star rating.
Worn and not even close to what it use to be.
The tub had built up calcium on the glass.the mirrors had the last renters tooth paste spattering on it. The bathroom mirror had a built in TV that had no reception. The  room TV speaker was distorted sounded like the speakers were blown. There seem to be red blood on one of the pillows too, maybe the maid cut their self and didn't realize it.
I see there rating was 4.1, not even close in my opinion. 
The next morning I asked to move to the new Rush Tower, Club Level. They did without hesitation. They did want to charge me $10 extra per room for the move. The $10 was not not the issue but I commented really? I asked if that made sense to them. They made a call to someone and did not charge me.
The rooms were fabulous. This was closer to what I expected. 
2 items to note, the maid had left her disposable gloves, they were on the sink in bathroom.
Also the caulk on the door of shower leaked when showering. Allot of water on the floor. More than a single towel could cleanup.
One last note, the pool. Most know their pool because of the unique slide through the shark tank. When I made the reservations I asked if the pool was open. They didn't mention the slide was broken. Closed....
One of the staff mentioned it discovered cracks in the slide tube in February. They thought it odd it still was not fixed. Well guess what that day construction started. Jack hammers and a flood of noise started 9am. We could only take it for an hour and left.
Avoid the pool until its done.",3,0,0

I never stayed here before, but was really surprised on how clean my room was for $39 a night.  When I was helping my friend check in they were cleaning her carpets, when I went to check in they just finished changing my filter on my a\/c...  Not to shabby of a room... I mean I had a huge flat screen TV, granite and tile bathroom..  I felt I should be paying more...   Plus all guest get access to an awesome pool area.  They have a live shark\/fish aquarium that has a water slide that goes right through it..  They offer lounge chairs, a hot tub, pool side bar, seriously what else can you ask for.  Yes the casino part is all old and ranky, but that's ol' Vegas baby.  
I did get to see the wedding chapel and for what my friend paid for her services it was a steal.  Very elegant and formal feel.  Also an after party was in a suite and can I tell you, I felt like I was walking in the Tony Montana's house in Scarface, really HOT!  The suite had a jacuzzi tube, double story loft vibe, dramatic curvy staircase,a steam shower, baday(I totally know I spelled that wrong, but whatever) , full party bar stocked with glasses, nice loud stereo totally staying there next time I go..

I have been coming here for 20 years and used to love this place. I have been getting comped for ever and that has been great.  But what just happened gave me the creeps!

I just stayed in the Carson tower here over the last week and on the second day my friend woke up ravaged by bed bugs. He has bites on his arms, legs and fingers.  Gross!!

We called downstairs and they sent security up like we had done something wrong. We had to fill out a report and take pictures. If we wanted to move rooms they wanted to inspect the room and move us to another room. They wouldn't tell us how long it would take or even if we would end up getting a new room. They said they would give us new bedding if we wanted, but not give us maid service since it was later at night.  Weary from the incident,Vegas, and feeling intimidated we just settled for the clean sheets. 

The girl shows up with just sheets, nothing else!!! I tip her and tell her what happened and then she comes back with new bed skirts, comforters, pillow cases and towels. Would have been nice if that happened without me tipping. 

We called back down and they said since we didn't move rooms we would get a $50 credit towards the room. After trying several times to use the credit, and it not working, we realized that it wasn't going to happen and they were just hoping we would be quite since we were leaving the next day. 

Needless to stay, we took our new bedding and slept on the floor. Sleepless night for all of us.

After sharing our experience with employees and fellow guest we found out this is a common occurrence and practice here. 

Never I have been made to feel so dirty, unappreciated and of no value by an establishment such as I did by The Golden Nugget. I will not be coming back ever and please know that this place is infested with bed bugs and instead of solving the problem they just try to make you feel like you did something wrong.",24,0,2

In 2015, are there really hotels that don't give you free bottled water and coffee? No fridge in the room. Towels are TINY. I almost think they gave us incorrect towels because they were so small.

When my husband checked us in, the desk attendant ensured that our room was accessible. I am temporarily handicapped due to an injury. When she saw me and my husband asked if she anticipated that I would have trouble, she obtained approval for a room upgrade at no additional cost. I didn't expect much except an accessible bathroom, but she checked us into to a Gold Club suite on the 16th floor! Our room was amazing! I had access to an accessible restroom and shower stall. Our bed was comfortable and not too tall. It seemed like a bit much -- until I made use of the extras. One evening, I used the sofa and television in the living area while my husband was downstairs gambling. I was tired from a long day of sightseeing and shopping in the city. The chaise in the room was also very comfortable. I dozed off on it when we first got to the room because I was afraid I would have trouble getting in and out of the bed, but it wasn't a problem at all once I got over the initial apprehension.
I could go on forever about the pool and the restaurants -- even the buffet was pretty good.

This likely isn't a big deal if you are going with someone you trust but it could make for some interesting surprises.II didn't watch the tv with the exception of the end of the NCAA title game and the TV picture quality was quite poor but only on that station oddly enough. 

The only other thing that I didn't care much for was that where my room was located you could hear all the action at night\/early in the morning. I just turned on the AC unit to drown out the noise as it was rather mild at night. 

Overall would stay again. I had no other issues. I didn't do any real eating or gambling at the nugget. Much better casinos downtown for that..",1,0,0

The room was spacious and comfortable, the location on Fremont St (close enough to enjoy the fun but not so close that it's too noisy) is nice, and the buffet is pretty good (HUGEST piece of corned beef I've ever seen at the carving station).

The spa and salon bring the Golden Nugget above and beyond. It feels like a Roman bath, and the staff and amenities provide everything you could possibly need. We felt so incredibly pampered!

No one at Carson Tower front desk at 12am.  This is Vegas. Should be 24 hrs. Hotels in small towns have 24hr service.  You have to go to Rush or Gold Towers to check in to Carson Tower then haul your luggage back over again to Carson.

Room shower doesn't work & no rooms left. Waiting on maintenance since 1:25am & its now 1:57am.  

So far not looking good.  Not worth 1 star so far.

Room view is nice of moon & strip.  

But no shower water!  I'm tired & on DC time in Vegas. So my body clock is at 5am even though its 2am Vegas! 

I have a friend's wedding to attend in 12 hrs & need sleep & a shower before the wedding.

Update:  shower working but water still dripping badly when you turn it off, no matter which way you angle water knob.  I told front desk this but no maintenance ever came to fix it.  

I will give some good points though & up the stars to 2.5 for the rest of the hotel, not the room & extra charges for tea & coffee, Internet use ($12.99 for 24 hrs- quite outrageous when other hotels include free Internet), & $4 for a small bottle of water.  Go to Walgreen's 2 blocks from hotel to buy water, noise for construction, since I'm a nice person, & hate to give bad reviews.   

The location is great for Old Vegas & you can walk out of the hotel to Fremont Street which is crazy, but a must see.  The restaurants & bars inside the hotel are wonderful & the famous, largest ""Golden Nugget"" is showcased here.

 I'll write more later, but I must go run errands.",17,10,10

If you're looking for a full Las Vegas Strip experience, you may want to stay at a strip hotel rather than the Golden Nugget, because taxi will be a bit pricey and not the easiest to catch on the strip during busy times. Bus takes a looooong time to get from the strip to downtown, and at peak hours you may have to wait a while to even catch one.

It was our first time staying there and we had reserved a basic Carson Tower room. We walked up to a random employee at a counter near the Rush Tower elevators to ask where we could check in and he said he could do that for us. Awesome! He checks us in, we make the trek across the hotel to the Carson Tower, are happy that our room is near the elevators, open the door...and walked into a room that was still occupied. There were clothes and suitcases everywhere so we walked right back out. I left my husband there with our luggage while I went to complain & get a new room, now feeling a little uneasy that someone could that easily have access to all my stuff when i'm not in the room. They immediately upgraded us to a Rush Tower room and sent someone to help my husband with our stuff. Unfortunately that whole situation cost us about 45 minutes of precious pool time.
The room was very nice, view of the strip on the distance, spacious, his & hers sinks, big TV, and a couch. We made sure to use the safe when we left the room, just in case. We didn't use the coffee maker because the Keurig pods were in a 4 pack that cost $10 if you used even one. The GN Starbucks is 24 hours, though, so that makes it easy to get your coffee fix. 
I like that thee pool entrance was centrally located. By the time we got there, the pool was already packed and it was near impossible to find a chair to put our stuff down. The adult pool on the 3rd level was small and you have up pay $10 for a chair so we didn't even hang out there. The 2nd floor was just a bunch of chairs and cabanas, which was awkward since you can't even see the pool. The shark tank was definitely worth going to the pool to see. The slide goes so quick that you can't really see anything, but its still a cool concept. The drinks were a little pricey, but strong.

I got my parking slip stamped in the casino by their players club employee.  That is also a stupid policy as you used to be able to just stamp it yourself now I had to wait in line quite a while.  In addition, I was told you have to gamble to get it stamped which was fine with me but some people only want to have dinner and drink and they don't want to gamble.

Cons
- The in-room coffee was $10 for 4 cups. No thanks.
- Paid for the internet, had to have it for work. While I am ok with paying for it, the wireless signal should have been a little stronger.

My last review of Golden Nugget did not include the hotel rooms, but since I stayed at Golden Nugget a few weekends ago for my bachelorette party downtown I can now do an update involving the rooms, the casino, and room service.

If I were reviewing solely on the room this review would be a 2.5-star, which I know is impossible, so I have to bump it up to a 3. The room we stayed in looked as though it had undergone a serious revamp, but it was very eclectic and not in a good eclectic way. There were random half-curtains everywhere. The one on the bathtub was especially odd. Why only part of the curtain? The fabrics chosen clashed throughout the hotel room. I wish they'd gone with more of a neutral palette rather than many patterns. 

The room was clean though and they do supply plenty of towels and toiletries. Room service was ordered for myself because I was super late in getting to my own bachelorette party because of work. They have pretty standard fare and I ordered the chicken strips. They did come with a BBQ dipping sauce, but no ranch and came with some decent french fries. 

Even though we we stayed a GN we didn't get a chance to utilize their awesome pool. Around 10 AM is was already packed and I actually saw people setting up their towels on the hard concrete because there were no chairs left. Icky. No thanks. 

The casino review stands. It's still nice inside and everything has been redone. Therefore 2.5 room, but considering it's Downtown and the casino is nice must go up to 4 stars.",3,1,0

Apparently all the non-smoking rooms were given away the day before.  They said the smoking rooms would be deodorized and we would be able to move to another room the next day.  They went on to say that we should have booked using the guarantee upgrade.  For $30 more they would guarantee we would have a non-smoking room.  What kind of the BS is this? I have to pay extra to insure I don't get a room that smells like an astray?  

Go to the room and it did indeed smell like an astray (20 solid years of smoking I'd say).  Housekeeping eventually came up and deodorized the room, but in honesty it did very little to mask the smell of cigarettes.  In a couple hours the room smelled just as bad as when we first walked in.  We ended up going to a Walgreens and buying air fresheners and deodorizers.  I really cant overstate how bad it reeked of cigarettes.  I've stayed in plenty of smoking rooms over the years and this was definitely the worst.  

Called downstairs the following morning, couldn't get through to anyone at the front desk.  Called a few more times and eventually left a message with the front desk regarding a room change.

Room was easy to find and very nice. Everything in the hotel as well as Fremont St was easily accessible from where we were staying. The pool was really nice and fun. Staff seemed friendly. I like that there are 2 Starbucks so that I had coffee accessible to me at all times lol. The walk from the parking structure was also very easy to navigate and close. I'd stay here again for sure. It's a nice break to not stay directly on the strip. Golden Nugget is a quick drive to the strip though so it was easy to get there and get back. I'll be back!,1,0,0

Lots of progressive slots. Some live entertainment - at least there was when i was wandering through, and she was damned funny. I noticed that it appeared to have gone a renovation recently and that's probably a good thing. Some lovely Chiluly glass in their eatery and above their high stakes tables brought out the ""MONEY"" vibe to the floor.

We arrived early, (2 family's and 2 rooms) bellman immediately checked our bags in and valet our cars. 

Check in line took about 15 minutes, our rooms weren't ready but the clerk said they'd call me on my cell when they were so we can pick up the keys, so we decided to hit the pool, but had to go ask for our bags to get our swimsuits and towels NO problem the guy took me back there, and I was able to grab what I needed in less than 5 minutes... about 30 min later one room is ready, so up we go, call for our bags and they were there in less then 10 minutes. Another 15 minutes later they call and say the other room is ready, I asked jokingly if they can bring the keys to me, and they said sure no problem?????????????

The pool was pretty packed, but was amazingly entertaining for our kids, we didn't get any lounge chairs, but were offered a shaded section of couches if we spend a minimum of $200, well with 7 of us that were hungry and thirsty, it was no problem, and well worth every penny!!!! 

After a full day in the sun we went back to our rooms to get ready for a night full of entertainment of people watching on Fremont, and a great dinner at the Hash House a Go Go...once we got back to our rooms we slept like babies, on our amazing beds they were like sleeping on a bed of clouds....

The good:

Location. It's a good location if you're staying on Fremont street as it's not too far from anything down there. ABC Store, La Bayou, food, and good slots. 

Casino: Really good air conditioning!  I have to say, I felt very comfortable there in the 114 degree heat. 

Pool: Great pool area with outdoor gaming, and a really cool fish tank with sharks!  There is even a water slide that goes through the tank.

Room (Part 1).  The Room was clean, updated and felt higher end (wait there's more). Lots of towels, and a decent wall unit A\/C that kept us comfortable. 

The Bad:

Parking structure: One elevator worked, and one was broken. I was told by the front desk that maintenance knew about it, but it was never fixed. No A\/C either in the elevators. 

The Front Desk. We booked our room through a third party and we were told that did not include 2 beds, so there was an up charge of $33.00. We were also told that it wasn't something they could do anything about and they would never promise two beds without charging. I definitely did not feel taken care of. No offer made to make up for this issue, or even ask a manager or supervisor to speak with us. I get it, after a 5 hour drive, we didn't look amazing, but it would have been nice to have been treated like they wanted our business.  Good news, we didn't gamble much there anyway. Their loss. 

Elevators: No A\/C. Really? These were the ones inside the hotel as well. Apparently a theme at this location. 

Ice Machine: Ran out of ice, but hours later it did work again. 

Room (Part 2). The sink and bathtub had a sewer smell, that didn't really get better. It wasn't something  I felt was becoming a nice place. There was rust in the bathtub around the drain. Nice!

I had a good time in spite of the issues, but that's what family does.  

I usually stay on the strip, so this was an experience, but not sure I will be trying it out again at this location.",14,2,3

My adult son and i enjoy the downtown location because other casinos are a mere short walk away.  Downtown is getting its own bar and restaurant scene making it a tough choice to venture to the strip.  '

It once was a beautiful spot to stay, and our favorite hotel downtown, when the walls were creamy white with gold accents throughout the hotel.  Back when the ceiling was high so that it wasn't like walking through a dark dense smoke cloud as it is now.  My clothing reeked daily because it was so stinky smoky, and although the rooms are labeled non-smoking, the ventilation system cannot screen out the smoke smell.  

We asked for a quiet room and was assigned a ""mountain"" facing room (in other words, facing Fremont St.) #18206 by the most unfriendly desk clerk ever.  She didn't say a word, it was obvious she was having a bad day.  We entered the Rush Tower room, and it was so dark and dank we could hardly see, even after turning on every light.  Dark brown black and brown interior with a tub\/shower combo that is difficult to step in & out of because the tracking is so high.  Light comes out at you from the mirror above the sinks which make it impossible to see anything-horrible lighting.  Door to room sticks and is difficult to shut, you have to really slam the doors or risk it staying open.  You can hear every sound from the people above you, beside you and the clanging of the staff - not sure what was making all the noise coming from the walls.  TV channels were very limited, maybe 5 or so?  Picture did not come in very well.  The room was dark, dark, dark, did I say the room & hotel was dark?  The fun began when we came in our room from the casino after a ten hour drive that morning ready to sleep at 9pm - impossible -  the music from Fremont street was blasting & vibrating through our room, it was hard to even hear the TV.  What a BAD design plan.  I called down to the front desk and was informed it would quit at 11pm.  Ugh.  It ended finally around 11:30pm but the noise lingered until 1am.  Next morning we asked to switch rooms.  Our next room, not ready until late afternoon was much, much better noise-wise.  Everything else was exactly the same except for maybe a sliver more light coming through the window & a much better view of the strip.  Charges for the coffee & water in room-tacky.  Nice shampoo, soaps, etc.  Bed was pretty comfortable.

Food-wise they took out our once favorite cafe that served great quality food and added Claim Jumper, a chain restaurant (who wants a chain restaurant, is that the best they could do?) and The Grotto which has horrible pizza.  The whole smoky vibe is bad, even when you venture toward the only light in the casino, near the pool, to see the poor sea creatures contained in a too small aquarium at the pool-with chairs packed so close that it is impossible to squeeze a leg between to lay down on one.  Awful.  Vic and Anthony's was delicious, that is about the best I can say from a food perspective.  

The downtown vibe is great if you like porn in your face every time you venture from the hotel, Fremont street is gross.  We won't be back to this hotel.",0,0,0

Let's be serious, a slide that goes through a shark tank?  Yes please!  I'm pretty sure I went down the slide more times than any of the kids in the hotel...  And we never got kicked out of the pool area even thought we constantly took over the hot tub and adult areas.  Major props to their staff for putting up with a few hundred rowdy idiots.

Notes: Make sure to put the ""do not disturb"" sign on your door or you'll be woken up around 9am.  Yes, I know that isn't early for some, but this is Vegas after all.  And more importantly, there are multiple towers, it is easy to get confused when coming in late at night...

Our rooms were in the rush tower. Probably a good 400sq feet, room facing the strip view which I enjoyed and you get 2 bathrobes with slippers which I thought was delightful. The hotel was immaculate, there were fish tank at the bar, swimming pool with exotic fishy and sharks. I was very impressed how modern and sleek the place looked.

For example, I miss having a dedicated elevator to the upper floors.  They only had 4 in the Rush Tower and one was inoperable.  Another example, they don't have a ton of valet hosts ready to greet you when you pull your car up.  I found the location of the TV in the room rather off because you couldn't see it from the sofa in the room, but only from the bed. There's no fridge, but they do have a Keurig machine which you have to pay for if you use their coffee.

All that being said, the people were the most friendliest people in Vegas.   Every single person I interacted with made me feel important and took the time to answer my questions or assist with my needs.  From the Players Club to the Valet - pretty much perfect.  An example, I dropped my Key FOB at the Valet, which appeared to have broke into pieces.  Not good.  Well, they young man helped me put it back together including finding all the small parts that flew everywhere and got it working again.  The people in the VIP area were extremely helpful, especially when I asked if there was place to print my boarding pass and they offered to print it for me.   There were a few other surprises along the way (a nice hand pay at a slot for example where again - the slot hostesses were extremely nice and seemed to celebrate my win as much as I did.  

Another thing I've read about is the noise from the street.  We were on the 15th floor, facing the strip, and even though ear plugs were provided, I couldn't hear a thing from Fremont Street.

Finally she came by asking if we wanted more drinks. I said no but I'd like my $12 change back. She handed me $11. She said ""this is all I have."" I told her keep the dollar.

And when I say ""stench,"" I'm not talking about ""Oops, I left the milk in the fridge 2 days past its expiration date"" - I'm talking, ""Oh my God who died?"" stench.

He offered to give us $50 in food and drink credit, leading me to believe this had happened before. Once we had the AC going, the smell in the room diminished (what a time for me to forget candles! I usually take them whenever I travel) and we were so tired we were able to just go to sleep. First thing the next morning, we were switched to a different room (higher, with a view-and closer to the elevator as well-the other room was almost a quarter of a mile from the elevator, no exaggeration.) The new room smelled like what you expect a hotel room to smell like-that is to say, it didn't. We paid almost $100 for the first room, but they made it ok-sort of. I will conduct a separate review of the restaurant-think we will hit the buffet. The hotel is in a nice location and the public areas are very nice-but when we talked to the housekeeping supervisor and tried to get her to ""smell"" the room, she was very reluctant, and when she did, she acknowledged that it needed attention.

Then when we finally got to the counter, got our room keys we took our bags upstairs as their was no porter to carry the bags, then when we got to our room, there was someone else in it! LOL!

Out of the 4 days we stayed, our room was only cleaned twice, one of the sinks in the bathroom was clogged and they finally got maintenance to come unclog it the second day. One of the lamps in the room didn't work, and the way the bathroom was designed, you had to close the bathroom door to open the closet.

Then when we checked out which was early in the morning on a Monday the VIP desk was also closed so we spent money upgrading to VIP for nothing.

The drinks are reasonably priced ($7) and the reserved area has a low minimum to sit there ($25). There is a shallow area of the pool with these really cool chairs that are partially in the water.

We languished slept and ate at the terrible buffet, which had about zero choices of entree to choose from and all tasted like crap.

I also choose this casino because they had a workout facility, I went to the gym area, which looked like a Bath and Body Works and said, ""Is this the Gym?""  A woman said, ""Yes, for $20 you can have access to the workout area.""  Nice, I have to pay for the gym just like the water in my room, coffee, Internet, etc?  This place is trying to get more money out of me after I already paid a fortune to stay in their coat closet?

The most important reason we went to this hotel with our kids was for the giant fish tank pool experience, which was actually not experienced by us at all because the hotel caters to drunks that are passed out until checkout time.

Sure, modern Vegas is great & fun, but you can do so much more for so much less on Fremont Street!


The Golden Nugget is where you should stay if you're into hanging out on Fremont Street, hands down.

Myself and 3 other people stayed in one of the Rush Tower deluxe rooms. And the room was fantastic. 2 Televisions, a fantastic bathroom, 2 couches......

...but only one bed.

When I reserved the room, the website said it was for up to four people and had the option of getting two full beds.

When we arrived they told us that was an option, but not a guarantee.

Normally this sort of customer service would merit a god awful review.

But....they have a slide that goes through a shark tank!

And as I said, the room was very nice for the price, especially for 4 people. There was plenty of room to sleep on the couches...but when you're two couples, it's a little less than ideal.

But if you're going with a few friends or if that doesn't bother you, then go for it. No regrets staying at the Golden Nugget, and I definitely would do it again. My only complaint is that I wish they'd be a little more honest with their online reservations.",4,2,1

Although I agree with some reviewers that this place is one of the classier places in Las Vegas, if you're seeking out a cheap room during CES, you should be prepared to pay $$$ for a * location, * bed, * shower and swimming in smoke in your short trip from the elevator to the exit.

It began when I checked in. I was to receive a coupon book, but was told it only applied for future visits. I later found out this not to be the case.

My biggest irritant was returning to the hotel to find the valet was not accepting any more vehicles. After circling the self park for twenty minutes I left the parking garage. The attendant was extremely rude and told me I would have to park some where else. Rather than try to help me, she was more concerned with letting me know the hotel would not be reimbursed me for the parking fee. At 12:30 PM, I really wasn't concerned with the fee as I was finding a place to park. What they had done was sold the lot. If the guests are inconvenienced, that is OK, as they are making a fee.

When I checked out the next day I expressed my displeasure in not being able to park at the hotel. It fell on deaf ears and no offer was made to send a bellman to help me take my luggage to the other hotel's parking garage. They really didn't care, they were not being inconvenienced.

I was left with the impression that all the Golden Nugget is concerned about is extracting every dollar they can from you with the least effort possible.

The rush tower is the nicest, it's the newer tower and everything there is more modern, but even if you don't have that upgrade, you will be ok as long as you are not expecting fanciness.

Be prepared, they charge you for EVERYTHING! a bottle of water was $7!! and there is no refrigerator, the coffee pack in the room is $10. So, go to the store ahead of time and get some bottled water and coffee if you need it in the morning. There is a Starbucks downstairs but the line is never ending.

I also wrote a review on Trip Advisor about the robbery.  5 people who saw my review contacted me that they were robbed the same way: While they were sleeping in their room. Robbed on the first night of their stay, because you would be carrying the most amount of cash.  Around a holiday or an event happening in Vegas.  4 of them were on the same floor and tower in a span of 6 years.  All of them did not have a chain lock or deadbolt on their door, until they were relocated to another room.  After reviewing some of my photos of the first day, we did not have a chain lock on our door either.   The Golden Nugget didn't do anything about it, and shrugged it off.  The corporate office also gave the runaround.  

I had some time to reflect on the incident.  The robbers were professional about it.  They lined our bags by the bathroom door, so they can use the light to go through the bags without it being bright in the room. The room was also pitch black because of the curtains.  The money and casino stubs were in multiple areas.  I found my wallet was on the nightstand, but I do remember leaving them in my pant pocket on the floor.  Which means they were that close to us.  They did not steal our cell phones or credit cards, because they can easily be traced. 

Looking back, after we went to the front desk to report the crime, the clerk relocated us to another room.  We went back to our room to gather our stuff, and became locked out, because they room key became invalid.  We called the front desk, and they sent a security guard to open the door.  She said that she could see the history of the card keys used with her electronic device that unlocks the doors.  She just paused and said ""oh..."" and opened the door.  I never got an answer, because that's when my girlfriend realized her Macbook Pro was missing.

I'm not going to make any accusations, but this is a little too coincidental.",15,4,1

It was a bit crowded but what can you expect its las vegas and over 100 degrees out. The pool was neat i thought, i loved the waterfalls, just the ability to relax on a chair in the water, drink a pina colada, and watch the sharks in the tank. The slide looked cool to try but i did not try. It got windy by 5pm so we decided to go in the hot tub that was nice but because there were more kids in the hot tub then the pool that part sucked. I almost had a kid jump on me because he thought it was funny to run, try and jump in the water. I was getting a bit angry but finally after the 5th jump the kid's parents yelled at him. There was trash on the ground everywhere but once again its las vegas and it is party season so i just ignored that but i just thought to myself that people are pretty lazy that they can't even throw their trash in a trash can. I did take notice that the cleaning staff was trying to keep up on it. I had a fun day in the sun with my friend. I would go again, can not really complain since a friend got us in for free. If you have time while staying here in vegas or live here all year round, i would take a day and go swimming here. 

There were some things that i took noticed as i was leaving that give me another reason to come back. I took notice to stairs going up to a top level with a pool maybe a better place to relax and get away from the crowd and kids. I also want to try the slide, pretty neat that it goes right through the shark tank. there are firepits so a nice evening by the pool maybe more relaxing once the crowds head out for a night on the strip.  parking was free, i know the sign said $2 hour but the lady let me go for free so that was nice of her. there was one thing that scared me a bit but i almost got hit by a car as I left the hotel. one of the streets as you leave the golden nugget hotel grounds there is a street and it is a bit hard to see because of cars parked and people trying to cross but just be careful because you have to pull out a bit far to be able to see if anything is coming and there is no four way stop which i think there should be. i believe the road is called Gold Nugget Drive but once you get there you'll know what I am talking about. its the main street before you pull into a drive way that has the parking garage, valet and pool entrance for the golden nugget.",0,0,0

Having never been to Fremont, I decided that this year for EDC I'd book a place downtown and explore another part of Vegas than the strip (at off-strip prices!). My flight got in at 6:30am, so I went to the front desk exhausted and hoping by some miracle that the room I'd reserved or one enough like it was available already. 

It wasn't, but the gentleman at checkin did offer me an upgrade to a suite for what ended up being $35 per night (really, $60 but that included the resort fee which we would have paid anyway) and I leapt at the opportunity. I was given a room on the 16th floor and informed of all the additional amenities I could enjoy as a club level guest. The process did take a bit longer than I'm used to, especially for how early it was in the day, but I didn't mind that as I was just looking forward to trying to sleep.

The room was, honestly, far larger than I needed. It was just myself and rave bae, so we didn't really need a living room or 6-seat dining room. But the minifridge, daily bottles of water (something like 8 bottles) and an extra bathroom really came in handy! 

The bed was comfortable, the Gilchrist and Soames toiletries were a nice plus, and the towels were the best I've ever used - so absorbent I am buying some for my home. The floor was quiet for the most part (which is unusual for EDC week but I guess the folks staying up there with us, being as they're spending more money probably want a calmer experience) and although the hallway smelled stale (kind of like cat pee) the room did not, at all. 

I did use the spa while I was there which was such a nice addition to the trip - honestly in itself worth it for the price of the upgrade.

Again, I have no idea because EVERYTHING COOL ABOUT THIS HOTEL IS BEING REMODELED!!! The story is, if you want to know about the Golden Nugget you must come back in June.  And whatever you do-- don't cross the street and venture into The Plaza. Contrary to the rumors, it's not like the ""Plaza"" in New York (at all!) and is a soul sucking experience.

But there is a saving grace here, and that would be the wonderful real estate conference being held here by my friend's family. I highly recommend it although I will not name who they are for the sake of their privacy (they are like the kennedys). The other good thing about ""the nugg"" was the 13.99 champagne buffet brunch. The food itself was god awful, but it was gratis, and the mimosas were just lovely! And who doesn't love a vegas buffet? 

Also the in-room movie selection was fantastic - I think we saw 3 separate movies starring Donald Faison, some of which never even made it to the movie theater! Ha ha. I'm sorry this review makes no sense, but as you can see, neither did my vacation...

I just needed to a place to crash for the night, and the $60 room in the Carlton Suites sounded fine.

Of course, it was older, and not exactly what you'd call luxurious - but the bed was comfy.

However; the window heater was basically broken and make LOUD clicking sounds whenever it started up. The toilet also ran loudly every six minutes or so (yes, I timed it).  Fortunately, I had earplugs with me. 

The two real downsides?
The registration for the Carlton Towers was closed, making me walk with all of my luggage over to the other tower to register - and then back to the Carlton towers - a bit of a hike when you have luggage, and there was no offer of help with that. Serious drag. I suppose that if I had valet parked my car, this wouldn't have been an issue - but I don't trust valets.

Also - and more important; the bathroom was not clean.
Black mold in the showers. Scuff marks on the floor and on the side(!) of the sink. There were rings from drink glasses on the nightstand and vanity. Not like white water marks on the wood, but actual rings from soda or something. Hello? Housekeeping??

I have been told that the newer towers are much nicer, and I'd be willing to try them out.

The whole place is right in the heart of Fremont Street - so if that's your scene, this is the place to stay. 

If you're a college kid who just doesn't really care about things being super clean, or are on a seriously tight budget, then I'd consider the Carlton Tower; otherwise, I'd look at other options.",4,1,1

This hotel is everything I was looking for in Vegas. The fact that you don't have to walk 4 miles to go from your hotel to the restaurants and then to the pool was the best part. Valet is FREE, the wi-fi not being free is not an issue as my phone has free Wi-fi anyway.  The price of drinks and food will more spendy than back home, WAY cheaper than any other Vegas hotel. 

  The pool OMG was to die for, the kids had a blast, and yes.. there was a lot of kids but guess what adults.. You have two upper decks with your own pool areas.. So why are you complaining about too many kids in the pool?  I was able to get up by 7am to throw a towel down on some chairs to reserve them for later, but I felt bad for the people that walked around forever looking for an empty chair. The pool was over-crowded people were sitting on the ground....I saw like 4 fights about people reserving chairs with old towels.. I say, quit whining, get up early and do the same thing :)

I love the Golden Nugget. Since growing up I have been to Vegas many many times with my parents, usually always staying on the strip. Once I turned 21 and was able to go myself, I decided to visit the Golden Nugget. I've been here about 3 times now & I really do love it. I love their pool, their rooms are very nice!! Clean, updated, flat screens, comfortable beds. etc. Their black jack tables also starts at 5 $ minimum, which is better then 20$ minimum like other hotels on the strip. Its about a 10 - 15 min drive from the strip which is not far at all. Plus you have your own little downtown strip, which yes ITS OLD, but its cool, you dont have to walk 3 miles to get to the next hotel, people are dressed up, cheap food etc.

If you hate paying the resort fees, would like a clean nice updated room, a cute hotel. Nice Shark tank swimming pool, 5 $ tables.. etc. etc. Stay here! Then go to the strip at night.

Resort fee was expected as I read reviews before going and I know it is not exclusive to this hotel.The beds are comfy. Overall good night of sleep. Room was pretty basic. Hotel staff were very friendly. We received water any time we asked.
We did not get to enjoy the pool as the one day we set aside to do so ended up being windy and cold. It is a beautiful pool area.
We enjoyed playing in the casino here. Make sure you join the player's club.
Location is fantastic. Freemont St is amazing for people watching and great vibe.
If you enjoy value, nostalgia, casual vibe, and people watching this place may be for you. I will absolutely stay here again.
The only thing I did not like, and this is an issue in more than just the GN, is the time share people from Diamond Resorts. They are set up in the desk in the ""lobby"" near the Carson Tower elevators and one of the casino entrances. We were approached with an offer for $150 casino credit, $150 dinner and free stays. Sounds too good to be true? It is. It was only when the lady pulled out a map with ""Diamond Resorts"" on it that I realized what this was. Research this company and avoid at all costs.

The Golden Nugget is in the middle of Fremont and it is also the nicest looking hotel in downtown. The pool is also gorgeous, although I didn't get to go to the pool until the last day of my vacation in 105 degree weather. What's better than hanging out in the pool with a couple beers in the sun??

My guy and I stayed two separate occasions within the same trip, because we had to change to new years and a lot was already booked up-he decided to stay another day so we ended up in the carson tower.

First off, we stayed in the Gold Club VIP room- I LOVED IT the bed was SO comfortable, no bedbugs very clean, the Shower was awkward to get into, and as long as you plan to take your clothes out of the closet in there before a bathroom hog gets in you're fine.  My guy LOVED that there was a TV in the mirror, I think he turned it on and never turned it off lol.  I kinda dug how people were envious of us when we had to insert our gold key to get to our floor, and we even explored the presidential\/executive suites floor one night BEAUTIFUL... I might try that when we get married because why the hell not.  It was cool to have free ameneties, wifi, water snacks...

The staff was incredible here and pushed my decision to go for the lowest room type for the one off day I needed another room.

Carson tower; when we first walked into the room, I was surprised to find some things in the room I liked BETTER than the VIP.  The bathroom for one, was a little more normal in size and the showerhead envelopes you when youre in there I wish I had that one at home! the bed, again SUPER soft and no bedbugs.  . . still treated awesomely even though we booked the bareminimum... only flaw about that room was the AC was a little terrible and my guy gets hot.  

Golden Nugget is my favorite place on fremont for sure, the parking is so easy I didn't feel like it was going to be a hassle except, it was packed and a couple nights, we had trouble getting a spot but eventually we got lucky.

I was meeting some friends on the Strip and came in a day early, and since I hadn't even been downtown in about 8 years, I decided to spend a night here. Booked a corner junior suite for the unreal rate of $89 and it was one of the hotel bargains of my life. Large open space with a comfy sectional leather sofa and flat-screen, table with two chairs, and actual entryway with decor. Bed is fine and there's another flat-screen facing it. Only room layout problem is that the closet is all the way across the room from the drawers. The bathroom is long if a touch shallow, but there's still plenty of space and it's very attractive in that modern Asian style. The wallpaper that's patterned to look like tile was maybe a touch tacky, but no matter. I was very pleased. (The tub and shower aren't separate, which isn't my preference, but the tub is still wide and deep enough for a good soak.) The vibe of the rooms is sort of like THEhotel at Mandalay Bay, only done with the choicest stuff from Pier One instead of custom-designed originals. 

Some have complained about check-in waits and front-desk service. I arrived about 11:15 and was the eighth party in line. There were two people working and it took less than ten minutes to get to the desk. The staff person took the time to meet my room requests (high floor, not facing Fremont) and was very friendly. Only other hotel service encounter was when the DVD player didn't work and the engineer knocked himself out to get it replaced promptly, even going down to housekeeping himself to get a new player rather than waiting for them to bring it. 

Tried Chart House for lunch. Food is very good, not great, but the lobster and shrimp spring rolls were quite nice, the staff was pleasant, and the aquarium is spectacular for just sitting and gazing. Had dinner at the bar at Vic & Anthony's and the staff was superb, as well as the steak. I'd put it as the second-best steak I've had in Vegas, just behind Carnevino at the Palazzo. 

I paid the $20 to upgrade to The Hideaway part of the pool area, and it was worth it. No trying to find a lounge chair (they're assigned), no screaming kids, and faster drink service. This is the way to do a Vegas pool. If you want full sun through the afternoon, try to get them to give you a chair closer to the Strip end of the pool. Shade hit about 3pm on the other side. 

There weren't many downsides. This is not a Strip level of luxury or facility, but it's still a very nicely-run hotel. Did hear from several that the Rush Tower blows the other towers away, so book there. The casino layout is a touch confusing but manageable. 

Other notes from the area: Casino staff at Binion's was very friendly, bar staff at Binion's Steakhouse was not. It's worth walking down a couple of blocks to take a look at the restored signs that are part of the Neon Museum exhibit. There's a CVS a couple of blocks away for any forgotten items. Lastly, tried Bell Transportation's shared van service from the airport. Sure, you have to stop a few times along the way, but at $8 to downtown vs. $30+ in a cab, it's a steal.",3,0,0

Also, SHARK TANK SWIMMING POOL!

We had a great time with great service.....

We came back at the end of Sept and let me tell you Jekyl and Hyde this place...

Paid more and stayed at the Rush tower. It's a nice room. Sadly they want $200 bucks a night on the weekend, which if you've ever been to Vegas you know you can stay in a VERY nice hotel for that. Not just a nice room in a mediocre hotel.

Bellhop and Security both had a hard time getting to the room.... for some reason.

They magically checked us out a night early, so coming back our room keys are deactivated and you have to jog all over the casino to find a tower that has someone working. Oh and they still charged me for that night..... when we ended up just crashing at our friend's. 

Room service screwed up or order, then got rude, then tried to tell us we would have to order the same thing AGAIN and pay twice. Manager was rude and we had to spend 20 minutes trying to get the right order without being charged twice.

They have now charged my credit card more than double what the price should be.
I had to call 3 times before someone actually sent me an itemized bill. My email regarding the over charge has never been acknowledged. Watch your bank statements if you stay here. There were some charges removed (by magic) when I called and asked for an itemized bill...HOWEVER they still have almost $500 in mystery charges that we are trying to resolve.

I'm just saying, if you want to pay $1500 for TWO nights in old town this might be your place, but I don't recommend it. I'm trying to get this resolved so I can go back to thinking good thoughts about the Golden Nugget....

The slide through the shark tank is something I check out every time - it's so cool.

They will validate your parking ticket by just going up to the cage and over the far left. It's like one of those timecard gimmicks where you just clock in. It's worth doing as you'll save some $$$ on parking.

I really like the additions they've done to this place. They've added more bars and brightened up dark areas and dimmed the super bright areas. There's a cool vibe here. I've never stayed down here, but if I was going to stay downtown - Golden Nugget would be at the top of my list.",1,0,0

We stayed in the Carson Tower and the rooms were clean and large and the bed slept amazingly great!!
The staff was very attentive and kind when we spoke with them

We played one day in the hotel pool and rented a cabana for $450 a day. The Cabana was great, nice couch and tv in it and while the pool was small and packed with people we had a fabulous time in it and would love to go back again. We have stayed at the cabanas at the Luxor pool and while there is a lot more room, I remember the cabana rent for a day to be over $1000 so the Golden Nugget pool was a B1G winner!

There were a ton of nice restaurants in the hotel as well while we ate at Grotto and Chart House with both serving nice meals (reviews written separately)

Used to be internet friends with the Hotel Manager at the El Cortez, and we stayed there numerous times.  I have also spent many nights at the Golden Gate. The Golden Nugget is my new favorite place to stay.  Now that we make a little more $, we can afford this place (we are cheap).  

I LOVE the older Las Vegas vibe so smokey rooms don't bother me even though I'm a non-smoker.  My wife hates it.  We upgraded to a Gold Club Room at check-in having reserved a standard Carson room online weeks earlier.  I have never stayed in any other part of the hotel.  The room smelled like a cigar lounge when we walked in.  While all the GC rooms are non-smoking, I'm pretty sure that hasn't always been the case.  I've read on this board that the newest tower - Rush Tower - is smoke smell free.   We asked to smell a different room on our floor, and it stunk as well.  Housekeeping sprayed something that helped quite a bit, and we probably got used the smell over time as we used to do at the El Cortez.  

We really dug the bed in the Gold Club Room.  It was very comfy.  I personally like the dark wood and stying of the rooms.  We learned this trip that these rooms are the only ones with wi-fi, and it costs $12.99 per 24 hours.  We paid for two days on only one of our laptops.  The couch area and the Plasma TV are nice touches.  

The bathroom is a little cramped.  We are used to getting ready together, and that is almost impossible.  The doors of the closet and shower and room all seem to collide together in the same small area when opened.  The shower door opens like a closet and so there is a space between the door and the rest of the glass so water always leaks out onto the floor.  I suppose the rainfall shower is cool, but I like water pressure and this style of a shower head doesn't provide that.

Housekeeping staff was awesome, and I tipped them $5 a day.  They never rushed us and always honored the do not disturb sign.  I'm always happy to find an iron and ironing board in the room though this time we didn't use it.  There are two robes in the bathroom closet.  Overall this is a room that I would rate 5 stars but considering the smoke and the Mrs, I'm going with 4.  Maybe I'll try to book a Rush Tower Gold Club room next time.  However, I'm sure it won't have the ""old vegas"" feel i like.",1,1,0

I'm not proud of it and it's a first for me, but sleeping in the bathroom was about the only place I could get some rest.  Had the front desk only informed me that the music and noise coming from Fremont Street Experience was so loud that it penetrates the walls of the Rush Tower hotel rooms facing it, I would have elected to go on the opposite side of the tower.  I was here on business, not by choice, and got the short end of the stick.  People staying here be warned: if you are in the new Rush Tower facing  Fremont Street, the music plays full volume until 3:00am and literally penetrates the windows and walls.  Putting your hand against either of them will reveal the pulsating beats and low-end frequencies of the music being blasted from 100 feet away.  I'm not being elderly about it- I'm in my 30's and enjoy loud concerts....just not when I'm trying to sleep.  

I was compensated 1 night free for my troubles (stayed a total of 2 nights).  I'll say that the rooms in the new Rush Tower are nice and hold their own against any of the newer 3 star hotels on the Vegas Strip.  But what good is a nice room if you can't enjoy it?

Customer service was the worst experience I have ever had at any hotel.  When I called at midnight willing to change my room for another, nobody at the hotel was willing to help.  I complained that I was never given a notice about how much noise would be pushing through the wall and it was only met with a mere ""well, this is Vegas and the city never sleeps"" attitude.  I call B.S..  I've stayed in most of the major hotels lining the strip and have never had an issue with outside noise.  The next day the manager on duty, Orion, told me and my group of 20 business administrators that ""he would not"" allow us to speak to the General Manager, Brett, because he did not want to bother the GM with an issue like this.  I really can't believe that the words out of his mouth were ""I will not do that for you.""  Nice customer service.  He said that in front of a large group of us at the front desk.  This is what we in the business world say should be a ""never event.""  As in, me and my group of 20 administrators will never be back to the Golden Nugget based on the poor customer service.  I hope Brett puts a check on the attitudes of the managers because it makes the hotel experience awful and reflects poorly on the hotel management.  

My 2nd night they conveniently found me a room facing the opposite way as Fremont Street.  At night it was peaceful, quiet, and the way it should be.  

Thanks for comping me one night, though. It was my company's money and at least Orion admitted that my guest experience was not acceptable.  I told him to pass on to Brett that the Golden Nugget should start giving a disclaimer to all guests to warn them about the excessive noise that comes through the wall.  He said that it was ""a great idea"" and I'm sure that he was lying.  I bet he never brought it up again.  The fact is that the Golden Nugget is just not a guest friendly hotel at this time.  Maybe a change in staff attitude would help put the bow on an otherwise pretty package.",5,1,0

Across from the Starbucks and the gift shop at this hotel is a desk where they pass out free shows and food vouchers. They are affiliated with Diamond Resorts International. Run, run away and do not make eye contact with these people. DRI is a huge TIMESHARE SCAM. They will use high-pressure tactics at their presentations to force\/seduce people into making unwise financial decisions with a lackluster product. Yes, you can get free stuff out of it like we did, but if you have a hard time of saying NO, avoid this at all cost! 

Now onto the real review! The first things I want to say is that my expectations for this Hotel were blown away. I had heard from multiple people that downtown Las Vegas is not that great and that all of the hotels and casinos there are old and ""full of character"" (basically meaning janky old). And yes there were many of those types of hotels, but I would not say that the Nugget is one of them. It is easily the highest quality and most beautiful hotel on this side of the strip.

The rooms were very nice, even the most basic ones were comfortable. Sure, they charged 10 bucks for inroom coffee and water but this is Vegas, none of that is free anywhere (just go to Starbucks). The bed was huge and very comfortable.

The food was simply amazing here. All of their on-site restaurants had great menus and the places we dined at had great service and food. There is a good diversity of food options, ranging from Asian, Mexican, Seafood, to comfort American. Their buffet is pretty good too. It isn't the biggest I have seen, but they made up for it with quality food and neat little extras (homemade smoothies for breakfast!). 

But the real gem (or should I say nugget?) at this hotel hands down is the pool. There is a shark tank right in the middle of the pool. You can basically swim safely only inches away from large sharks. And even better, there is a water slide that goes right through the tank! This pool was probably the COOLEST pool I have ever seen in my life (and I have seen A LOT of pools!). The hot tub was also great; it could sit up to 20 people with poolside bar service. It was a bit chilly when we were there, but there is no way you cannot resist taking a dip in the water with so many cool features. Oh and I almost forgot they are also home to the one of the world's largest golden nuggets!  Find it near the candy shop.

I was in Vegas on business and while I could stay anywhere under $250 a night I stupidly choose the Golden Nugget because it was walking distance to my workplace. I checked in around midnight after a nice airport delay and 5 hour flight and was told I was being put in an upgraded room. At first I though amazing but after dropping my stuff, popping an ambien, and laying down I realized that the music and crowd from Freemont St. were readily audible. The bass shook the windows and I could feel it in bed. I tried for a good 15 or 20 minutes to get to bed but I could tell that wasn't happening. 

I made my way down the elevators and back to the front desk knowing that the ambien would kick in soon and I'd become a mindless zombie so I better get the issue resolved quickly. After speaking to the night manager and him telling me there was absolutely no rooms I begged for anything. He told me they might have a room with damage (I told him I didn't care I just wanted to sleep) but that they would have to check room by room. When I asked how long that would take because I would probably black out soon from my medication he asked ""Why does it matter how loud the room is if you're just going to black out?"" Honestly I couldn't believe what I was hearing but he repeated it several more times. I finally got fed up and went back to my room. Luckily they stop the music around 1 so when I got back to my room it was much quieter. Had I known that I would have probably been alright with it but of course no one mentioned that. I went to the front desk in the morning and they were able to get me something different that night. I didn't receive any apology and was told that if I wanted late check out I would have to pay for it. Most hotels go out of that way for customers but not the Nugget. 

The rooms do look very nice and are spacious. The upgraded room I got had an added on lounge area with 2 tvs and another bathroom. The beds were comfortable and the hotel looked very nice. The lines for check in\/checkout were longer than ideal. I was charged for Wifi even though it's supposed to be included in the resort fee, luckily I caught it and went back to the desk.  Claim Jumper was pretty tasty though service was bad. I went to the Gold Digger club on a Thursday and it was empty. The water slide is nice and the water was nice and warm.

I arrive to this place, confused trying to figure out where to park. I don't ever come here so yes-I was confused.

After extensive research and reading so many reviews, I decided to book the Golden Nuggets Hotel for a girls' weekend - it boasted as a 4-star hotel with great amenities, a shark tank pool, and awesome reviews by users.  It ranked within the top 15% of hotels in all of Las Vegas according to trip advisor (higher than that of MGM, TI, etc. on the strip).  I thought I had a pretty safe bet; what could possibly go wrong???

Let me tell you what went wrong...

(1) THE ROOM:  
- The room was small and had the smell of ""old""  because everything was old - from the carpet, linens, towels, to the furniture.  
- The beds were much smaller than other 4-star hotels - thank goodness we are not curvy bodacious babes!
- Our sink clogged up - we called maintenance and no one came...
- There was a flat screen TV, but the remote didn't work half the time - don't even bother calling maintenance cuz they'll come up and step all over your stuff.
- The knob below the shower faucet fell off.
- No refrigerator
- The lighting was very dim... maybe all the electricity were used to light the outside of the hotel. 
- Overall:  This aint nothing more than a 2-star room.  

(2) THE SERVICE:
The front desk and parking attendants were very nice.  Everybody else sucked!!! They all wanted their turn to snap at us.  The lady guarding the pool was especially rude and mean.  Maintenance never came up to fix our broken sink;  they did come up one time to fix a broken remote, and she was grumpy and stepped all over our stuff.  

(3)  THE POOL AND RESTAURANT:
The pool had a shark tank and slide... it was just ok nice.  Great  hang out for families with little kids - not so much for adults unless you want to get splashed all the time by the little rugrats -  not their fault, i'd do the same if i was 9 years old :)

I ordered chicken dumpling soup from the hotel cafe, I got canned chicken... food quality would be something you get in a cafeteria or denny's... how is this 4-star???

So that's my experience at the Golden Nugget - VERY VERY SUPER DISAPPOINTED!!!  It's not even comprable to the 4-star on the strip. Let's make it clear, this may be the best hotel in Fremont, but that doesn't say much at all - waaaaay below vegas standards. That begs the question:  why all the rave reviews???",5,0,0

I called in January for a May reservation and was told that for the two rooms I was booking it would be $119 per night. That was $119 per night for TWO rooms, NOT $119 per night per room. 

So I called back recently to add one more night to the reservation and cancel one of the rooms, and the first person I talk to can't even find my payment for the rooms! I paid in advance in January, but because they switched systems or something they couldn't find my payment. I had to go online and find it on my credit card charges and confirm it with them. Then I talked to another person who was confused because my card had been charged the $119 plus tax TWICE, when it should have only been charged once. The woman acted like it was a mistake that I was charged twice, when in fact if it really was $119 per night per room it wouldn't have been weird at all to see the two charges, right? 

So this whole time I'm thinking the room is now paid for, then when we show up they tell us that no, in fact we owe them another $119 plus tax for the other night. They also told me over the phone it would be 69 plus tax to add the third night, but when we got there it was 59. It's nice that it was cheaper but it's indicative of a real problem with their system and inability to properly quote customers on room rates.

I talked to the manager to was nice enough to 'waive the cancellation fee' if we chose to go elsewhere (yeah, during memorial weekend and punk rock bowling I'm sure there's TONS of reasonably priced rooms in Vegas... jerk). But he would NOT budge on the price of the rooms, even though THREE of his employees made the same mistake on the phone with me. He said that right now he could get 300+ for our rooms (which is exactly why I booked FIVE months in advance) so he couldn't budge on the price. So I told him to fuck off, I literally said 'you need to fire your employees and fuck off' and that was it. We're staying here because we have no other choice but I will never ever go back here again and I hope nobody else does either. What a bunch of crooks.",4,2,1

If this is of interest to you, than I highly recommend the GNLV.  Being disappointed by the prices, lux, and attitudes of those on the main strip, I decided to do some research and find luxury on the old strip.

Apparently, the GNLV has recently been renovated.  I decided to stay in the new Rush Tour in a King room.  I believe with AAA rate over the wknd it cost a total of $213ish.  Could not beat that considering the view we had of downtown, the cleanliness of the room, and the convenience of staying downtown.

FIRST, the room.  AMAZING!  Dark cherry\/burgundy wood decor and furniture aligned the walls in the bath and living space.  The bath area was like a spa, with dual sinks, vanity, huge shower head, spa tile bath, etc.  You are provided with 2 robes and slippers.  The living space is equally as nice, with super soft and comfortable bedding, an extra L shaped couch, desk with chairs, and a HUGE wall desk with lots of drawers, a flat screen, etc.  This is definitely one of the nicer hotels I have stayed in my whole life, and all for 88 bucks a night!

SECOND, the hotel: The Rush Tower had its own separate check in, valet, etc.  As you check in you are greeted with a large wall sized fish tank.  BEAUTIFUL.  Surrounding your every glance are Chihuly inspired (or perhaps the real thing) glass assembles: on the ceilings, the walls, randomly scattered throughout.  There are chandeliers around each bend adding a sparkling gleam to each room.  

THIRD, dining: We went to several restaurants in the GN during our stay.  The first was a teppenyaki restaurant to which I do not recall the name.  Amazingly delicious.  The second was your standard cafe\/kitchen.  We went early in the morning for breakfast.  I hardly remember what the food tastes like, I was drunk.

FOURTH, casino: The casino was clean, surprisingly fresh smelling, and offered a large variety of gaming.  I did not throw my money on any table games here as the minimums were $10 at each table (Binion's across the street charges $5).  I particularly enjoyed the Price is Right game (they have 3 available).  Be sure to get yourself a player's card so that you can earn rewards for your gambling.

FIFTH, convenience and class: The best thing about this casino is its location.  I LOVE downtown Vegas and love the old feel that you get.  You walk right outside and see the lights of Fremont booming, live entertainment at all hours of the night, and close walking distance to all your casinos.  

NOTE: I did not go swimming during my stay.  The pool seemed VERY busy, smaller than I expected, and seemed to close very early.

Also, a transformer blew a mile down the road when I stayed.  All the hotels, including GNLV, lost power on the last day of my stay.  I wrote an email about my experience to management and they cordially responded to the incident with a complimentary stay.  

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.  I have not stayed in any other casino downtown, but this once seems to have a touch of the new strip, with the class and trash of the old.",8,2,2

It's clean and the rooms are of a decent size. If you want to party downtown and have the Fremont Street Experience - old school Vegas style - this is not a bad place to be centralized. There are still way more hot females at the hotels & casinos on the strip though since it seems to be more family vacation oriented here. Slipping down the water slide through the shark tank is not as cool as it sounds, but it's fun and faster than it seems. A bit too fast to get a good look at the fishies while going through the tube, but you can swim next to them in the pool (with a glass separator of course). There's a couple of reservation only pools on the upper levels of the swimming area, but they are small and dinky. Gambling doesn't seem too exciting from the crowd and most of the table game workers seem down; we were probably the noisiest ones, but hey, at long as it's fun :p. It sucks that there were no fridge in the bedrooms, so we had to ask for pales of ice. They do leave out a bottle of Fiji water and a box of instant coffee which if you open will cost $7 for the H2O and $10 for the cafe. First thing I did when I came into the room was drank that water because I thought that the hotel was being nice, until my friend told me that we were going to be way overcharged for it. I was also planning to make some coffee afterwards, until the price tag was pointed out - Starbucks down stairs is even cheaper. At least the parking was free for hotel guests.",1,0,1

Being coerced by friends to buy cheap packages to Vegas, I succumbed myself to staying at The Main Street and The California Hotel.  Both locations, I prefer not to head back to, unless I have no choice.  Mainly because there are no poker rooms at either casino.  I've always heard that Golden Nugget was ""THE BEST"" downtown hotel to stay at.  OK, being the Strip Snob that I am, let me check it out and make my own decision.

After the first time I stayed at the Nugget, years ago, I have been sold!  Strip Snob no more.  I am a Golden Nugget Snob!  I just LOVE this location!  It's centrally located downtown and the casino is beautiful.  They have an awesome pool where they have a slide you go through where you can whiz through sharks swimming in the tank, the food is good and the POKER ROOM is awesome!  This is by far my favorite poker room because the friendly dealers make it so welcoming and even when I was only going to Vegas once every half year to quarter, they would still remember me.  Now when I walk in, I feel like Norm from Cheers when the old-timers pop their heads up and say hi.  

The rooms are very spacious and although I haven't stayed in the new Rush Tower yet, all the rooms I've been in have ample space.  The only thing I would suggest is that if this is your first time to Vegas, go experience the Vegas on the Strip, what you see in the movies.  When you become a regular like me where the view is not a big deal and you want to be at a place where you don't have to wait a half hour for valet to get your car, come to the Nugget.

As for the place that I find better than any fancy hotel on the strip, is The Golden Nugget. With the reasonable prices and newly remodeled rooms, this place has such great amenities to offer. Not only is it smack dab in the middle of Fremont Street, but it also has 2 Starbucks, a 24 hour Claim Jumpers, a casino and of course plenty of bars.

The nice soaking tub was a huge plus (the rain shower needed more water pressure) the bed was fairly comfortable and the best part is the Rush Tower is a completely non-smoking tower and you can definitely tell. 

The only draw back for this hotel is the other towers. It appears that the great service goes all toward the newer Rush Tower because when my friend and her husband checked into their Gold Tower room, they still had housekeeping staff fixing the room. Housekeeping took their sweet time with what they were doing and then still left some sharp metal thing on the floor which my friend's husband then stepped on. The Golden Nugget then had to be persuaded to move their room to the Rush Tower (where we were staying) to make up for the inconvenience.

We stayed in the Carson Tower and it was dirt cheap, less than $50 a night and the room was fantastic so I can only imagine how nice the more expensive ones are.  The pool was the selling point of the hotel for us, it has a water slide that goes through a shark tank!  We had breakfast at their breakfast buffet and it was plentiful and delicious, they had anything and everything you could ever want . After we checked out we were allowed to check our bags behind the counter and still use the pool. Inside the pool area there are lockers  for you valuables which was nice.

We left the hotel for a drive to the Hoover Dam and realized the hotel was easily accessible to all interstates which made the location fantastic.  We walked into our room and the maid cleaned the whole room top to bottom; dust gone, bathroom fixtures sparkling and consistently did a fantastic job every single day that we stayed at the hotel.  The pool was a delight, clean and we had no problem getting a chair at any time we headed down.  The slide was a lot of fun for all ages.  The restaurants were really good and we were able to try Claim Jumpers, Grotto and Chart House (service was fantastic and the food was good at every spot).  We hit a deer on the second night, coming out of the Grand Canyon, and the valets were wonderful with us; concerned about our safety and they kept asking if there was anything they could do to help us.  The last evening we were there we actually received a call from Martha who was a representative of the hotel, who was concerned about the events of our check-in.  We told Martha we were actually still in the hotel and she immediately offered to meet us either in our room or the lobby.  We sat down and went over all the events of our check-in.  She took detailed notes and was really concerned about the issues we had.  I was happy to meet with her and left the hotel really grateful that someone actually took the time to meet with us.

I booked two rooms with double beds non smoking, and when I checked-in they literally had NOTHING reserved for me. When you book the GN do not expect double beds, or any of your ""preferences"". (I went to Vegas on a weekday to avoid overbooked Hotels and GN was telling me they were sold out!) GN check-in is a SCAM to pull more money out of you. They entice you with a cheap rate but when you get there they nickel and dime you. I booked TWO doubled beds non smoking rooms, and they kept trying to give me everything but that. They knew I couldn't leave the Hotel because my reservation was booked through a 3rd party and it would be a headache to get a refund. GN would just tell the 3rd party I never showed up, so I had to pay MORE money to GN to upgrade just to get non-smoking rooms. Even AFTER I upgraded to RUSH Jr. Suites I still didn't get double beds. The rooms were nice and clean, but to get into the rooms was such a nightmare. Not worth it.

It's cheaper, it's more relaxed and there's lots of entertainment.  So, the Golden Nugget was a great place to stay...  or so I thought.

In a city where everyone gets comp'd something, we got NOTHING.  We were there for our wedding.  We checked in for 4 nights and told them we were there to get married.  There was no way we could have been lying as we were dragging boxes labelled ""Wedding"" and there was a bag with a wedding and bridesmaids dresses in it.  We had two rooms, one for us and one for our kids.  They offered to put us in the Rush Tower and the kids in the Carlson Tower.  How the hell does this make sense?  

The room was literally the farthest away from the elevator that you could get.  When you came in from the front desk, it was a couple minute walk to the elevator, then a few minute walk to the room from the elevator.  It was the last room on the floor, and no, they weren't sold out.  

The sink didn't drain in our room.  It took all morning.  

Housekeeping didn't come for both of our rooms one day.  When we called, they sent them up and they did one room while we went out.  We called again about the other room and they gave us breakfast in the morning, but we still didn't have dry towels or soap for the morning.  

The Carlson Tower had a musty smell in the halls.  It's a little dated, but it isn't terrible.  There's a lot of maintenance that needs to be done.  Like the EXIT sign falling out of the ceiling on one floor.  

Breakfast buffet was OK.  The dinner buffet was TERRIBLE.  Don't waste your time or money.  

Internet is not included.  

They didn't even send a cheap bottle of wine to our room for our wedding...  very disappointing.  

The pool was cool, but it is overcrowded.  There were cigarette butts in it.  There's not enough seating on busy days.

Vehicles backed up into the street waiting to get into valet area.  After finally getting to the valet area and unloading our bags we checked into our room about 9PM on a Friday night.  Got keys to our room and bell person took our bags.  Proceeded to our room only to find that the bathroom was all torn apart because the plumbing was in the process of having repairs done.  Called front desk and they told me they'd figure out another room to give us.  After about a 10 minute wait they called and gave us another room number and was to send the keys up with the bellman.  OK so got moved to second room.  It was filthy and appeared to not have been vacuumed.  Hair balls, hairpins, pop\/beer can tab, pieces of paper, room key from previous guest, and a plastic shot glass on floor.  I called housekeeping and they sent the housekeeping supervisor Doug Filter (sp?)  up to look at room.  He agreed that the cleanliness wasn't up to gold nugget standards and that the room would be cleaned that evening.  Wife and I went out for a bit and I returned to the room.  Maid had already re-cleaned our room and was cleaning the room next door when I arrived.  I went into the room and it was slightly better but most of the debris was still on the floor, including the shot glass.  She came over and asked me what I thought of her cleaning job and I pointed out the plastic glass on the floor.  She told me the reason it was still there is that it wouldn't go thru the vacuum.  I went directly to the front desk and told them about what just happened.  They said they would credit me either $15.00 off my bill or a $25.00 food\/beverage credit for all my inconvenience.  I thought this was pretty pathetic and I didn't want either one..just a clean room.  Stayed there for a total of three nights and the floor was never cleaned any better.  

On the second night of my stay I pulled into the valet area (after waiting out in the street in line) only to be told valet was full.  I explained that I was a hotel guest and they told me it didn't matter.  There was no room and I would have to self park.

I recently stayed at the Golden Nugget for 3 nights. I first night we noticed a few little bugs crawling around the room like a Beatle. Me and my fiancé didn't think much of it and just flushed the bug. The next my fiancé was sitting on the bed watching tv when she screamed because a strange little bug was crawling up her arm. Then I noticed several more bugs crawling next to the bed. We had no idea what type of bugs they were but we had decided that seeing several bugs in our room wasn't acceptable. We called the front desk and told them about the problem. They seemed to not think it was a big deal so they said they will give us $20 off of room service. Ha! After discussing the issue with the manager for about 20 minutes they moved us to another room. When we got into this room we noticed there was a loud cricket noise coming from the curtains. So we called the front desk again to have the problem resolved. They refused to do anything about the issue. So we went down to the front desk in person and complained to the manager. After she laughed and told us ""it's only a cricket, welcome to Vegas"" she decided that she would send a maintenance man up to catch the bug. After about 10 minutes of looking the maintenance man gave up and said he can't seem to catch it. So we called the front desk again and after about 30 minutes of them laughing at us, telling us to deal with it, telling us there were no other rooms available, they ""randomly"" found another room for us. 

We find it appalling that a hotel like the golden nugget is crawling with nasty bugs in their beds and when someone says something about it they just laugh at you and tell you to deal with it. I would have expected so much more from a large hotel like this one. It was absolutely disgusting!!!

To be honest, I was hesitant at first since I always stayed on the strip. I've walked through a few of the downtown hotels and wasn't too sure if I'd like GN.

We arrived at the hotel in the morning and left our luggage at the front desk while we gambled. At noon, we checked to see if a room was ready and were able to check-in. Recommendation: stay in the Gold Tower. It's close to the lobby, pool and front entrances. 

Our room was located on the 6th floor and had a king size bed. The room was clean and came with a keiureg. Everything looked fine (not old and\/or dingy). 

If you bring your own k-cups, it's free to use. If you need k-cups, it is $15...If you pay the resort fee, you do get two bottles of water for free as well as wifi for two devices. 

In regard to food: the hotel does have a Starbucks, Claim Jumper, a steak place, the Grotto (Italian food), convenience store and a small snack place.

The pool is something to check out! There is a water slide which slides through a shark tank! It's super cool. If it weren't so cold outside, I'd check it out.

In addition, the property also has a gym.

In regard to transportation. You can self-park or valet. Taxi pick-up and drop off is available at the front of the hotel; however the pickup for Uber\/Lyft is at another entrance in Carson tower.

I gave the hotel 2 tries because it is so convenient when attending a furniture market and I would love to see the reviviification of downtown Vegas happen.  But I had multiple room problems and the GN mgmt kept having to move me from room to room, till I said 'no more.'

 If I stay again:
-In the Rush Tower, I will book a high floor NOT facing Fremont St. Otherwise the noise and reverberation is unbearable--despite soundproofed windows etc.
-Carson & Gold Towers--they only have wired Internet & it costs extra. Forget about using your Macbook Air unless you have a mobile hotspot with you. 
-Unfortunately they really jack up their room prices during the furniture markets, so I probably won't be able to afford the Rush Tower room, anyway. They upgraded me to one because of my previous awful experience at the hotel, but it was overlooking Fremont St. and I couldn't sleep at night
-Carson & Gold Tower rooms have no desk, just a little table--difficult for working
-Carson & Gold Towers have sewer line problems. The sink in my Gold Tower room became completely backed up with sewage. The Carson Tower room had extremely slow drainage in sink and shower as if it was about to back up any minute. I would say that those two buildings need completely new sewer lines or major major sewer work.
-Safe malfunctioned in Gold Tower room and they wouldn't fix it unless i gave them a 1-1\/2 hour window waiting in my room for someone to come fix it,  which I couldn't do
-Choice of food in the hotel is low quality unless you spend really big bucks at that steak house
-My coffee is important to me--I noted that the Rush Tower room had free coffee the Carson & Gold require you to pay $10 for a box of Keurigs to use their pot

I was there the week of Thanksgiving and they already had their Christmas decorations up. Just beautiful!  The holiday decorations were impressive enough that our entire group stopped to take pictures to use for our Christmas cards.

They also have the most impressive pool I've ever seen. Right in the middle of the hotel is the pool and in the middle of the pool is a gigantic fish tank. The slide even comes down and goes through the middle of the fish tank. Completely amazing!!

I was also impressed with the games they had in their casino. My favorite was the horse racing where it's actually a table with little horses that run around a track built into the table. First it makes the game last longer, and second it's really fun to root for your horse as he's running around the track. Lots of shouting going on here!

Half of our team got here the day before me (Friday).  We have 5 employees total on this trip.  Mind you, our reservations for this hotel were booked 3 months ago all for non-smoking rooms.  The husband-and-wife team who booked a room with a king sized bed were put in a room with two double beds.  Not the end of the world, but the reservation was still wrong.  My boss was was placed in a handicap smoking room.  He is not handicap, but if there was a handicap guest they would not have been accommodated.  I finally check in on Saturday at midnight (we are here for a trade show and spent the entire day setting up our showroom so you can imagine how tired we were at this point) and I am told by the desk clerk that the hotel is at ""102% occupancy"".  How is this possible?  If you don't have a room available then how can you book a room for a guest?!?  He then says to me that they have a room for me, but it is not ready and needs to be cleaned.  Keep in mind check out is at 11AM so they have had 13 hours to clean my room.  They take down my phone number and say I will get a phone call once my room is ready.  My co-worker tells me to come hang out with her in her room until my room is ready.  At 12:40 AM we walked downstairs and went back to the front desk to ask about my room.  My room was still not ready so my co-worker and I went back up to her room.  By 1 AM we still had not heard from the hotel and decided to go to bed.  Fortunately, the hotel also screwed up her room, but in this instance actually worked out as she was given 2 double beds.  By the following morning the hotel still never called to inform me my room was ready so the owner of my company was able to get that night's stay refunded and I was provided a room.  I got up to my room which literally looked like Morticia's Lounge which was located directly next to the ice machine and elevator.  I immediately felt a sixth sense and could not stay there.  I ended up staying in my co-workers room for the remainder of the trip.  We ended up talking with the asshole manager who was nothing shy of being a complete dick to us, as though we had done something wrong.

I always like the Nugget.  My wife and I prefer old Vegas when we stay because it is much more affordable and easier to get around.  

The Nugget has the best pool option of any hotel downtown and at least feels like main strip option.  

The hotel is pretty nice and the new tower that they built is beautiful.  

Two issues here though, 

The new tower that they built doesn't allow the pool to get much sun during the day.  

The buffet is terrible, I haven't been in about a year, but last time it was the worst breakfast I had in Vegas.

Any marine biologist should know that once a shark is flipped on its back it goes into a state of paralysis. It can't move. So if it were sick initially, and still alive it would be in a helpless state on its back. Apparently the hotel staff were not concerned, even with all the children around and having a giant dead animal in the bottom of the tank. Personally this is disgusting and inhumane.

* I called the front desk to ask for pick-up service for dry cleaning. There was an annoyed, ""that's the bell hop, I'll transfer you."" I was then transferred to what sounded like the bell hop manager's desk line, ""you've reached so-n-so, please note my hours are Monday and Tuesday mornings, Wednesday late evenings...""
* When manually calling the bell hop at noon for next-day dry cleaning service, got ""same-day service has gone out today. You had to get it picked up by 9:30am."" This is Vegas, who is up that early? I asked if they could pick it up for the next day so I wouldn't oversleep the deadline and they huffingly said they'd send someone.
* Don't try to take the towels out of the pool area. ""That's Laundry's policy."" Who is this unreasonable ""Laundry"" who gets their kicks from freezing cold people dashing mostly naked through hotels?
* Like some third world country, wireless is NOT considered a basic service. It'll set you back $12 per day.
* Their gym (which is probably piss-poor anyway) is $20 per day. 

Besides poor customer service, the place really isn't that bad. Rooms are pretty clean, but the Rush Tower is worth the steeper nightly rate.",5,0,0

It started with our special comps expiring and them not honoring it!!! Like I said we stay here a lot. We spend a lot of money here. So we check in anyway and I ask for a view I got one the parking lot. The women who checked us in said she gave us a great view of downtown and she chuckled I should have had a clue. This was the start of bad service the whole stay.
Lets start with the nonsmokers room that smells like a ashtray and the lack of water pressure wow nice.
Did have a great meal at the Gotto but slow service and small portions.
Crappy service threw the whole hotel!!!!
Let me talk about checkout THEY HAVE A HIDDEN FEE FOR STAYING DOWNTOWN $5.65 A DAY YOUR PAYING FOR THE EXPERIENCE! Now 5.65 is not a lot its the point they said it was there as of July!!! Like that makes it alright lol.
I will no longer stay here even though I love there pool area!!

The Golden Nugget has good restaurants.  We ate at each one during our stay.  The pool was fun, we rented a cabana.
Checked into the Rush Tower special desk.  It was fast, but SO unfriendly.  The guy checking us in didn't smile, ask us a question, nothing.  
Our Jr corner suite room was HUGE.  the bathroom was incredibly big.  A nice treat.  The only thing we did not like was the little window .  It was the only form of natural light in the room.  It was over the pool and fun to people watch.
We like to gamble.  The casino floor is VERY packed in.  Actually, it is so crammed with machines that I found it hard to maneuver around.  There were several times I had to ask someone to squeeze by just to wiggle in between the walk space.  It was ridiculous.
The dealers were fine.  Not one dealer was friendly.  A smile and friendly conversation was rare.
UBER.  Yes, you can get an Uber car in front of the Starbucks door.  It was so handy to go to other casinos and others restaurants.  
Fremont Street is crazy.  It was fun to pop in and out just to normalize yourself.  There are some serious coo-coo's out there.  
I love to dress up in Vegas.  You just don't get dressed up in this part of Vegas.  I still dressed nicely each night.  But I was always standing next to the lady with the visor and fanny pack on.  
We were glad to experience downtown, so we can say we've done it.  But really, we will not be doing it again.

Check-in went smoothly with a very short wait.  Chose the Gold Tower because of its proximity to street and casino.  My first time staying in this tower, won't be the last.  We are getting up in age and walking distances are becoming a factor.

We upgraded to a deluxe king suite in the Gold Tower and were satisfied that we did.  A really attractive room.  Unfortunately, the bathroom lights didn't work and maintenance had to come up and ""reset"" them.   I'm glad I watched them do this because they went out again.  A television in the large bathroom mirror (double vanity) was cool.  Took them a half hour to respond, so I had to go in the dark.  The hair dryer did not work, either.  

The room was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable.  Pillows a bit too soft, but that's just me.  Good coffee in a large urn with fruit in a bowl each morning for the guests on the floor waiting at the elevator.  A nice touch that made us feel a little special.

I do have a major complaint here and I hope they are listening -- it's a lawsuit waiting to happen.  The bathroom, as lovely as it is, contains a deep tub with glass partition and door.  You really have to take a large step to get into and out of it and there is not a single grab bar.  There is about a half inch gap between the tub and the partition door so there is no way to avoid flooding the bathroom floor if you shower.  So, essentially, you are stepping out of a tall tub onto a flooded floor without anything to hold onto. Scary, especially for older guests.

Self check-out was easy.  The upgrade let us stay until 2pm, which was nice.  Checked our bags with the bellhops for a few hours while we gambled waiting for departure time.  All very smooth.

I am a local and have received massages at many casino spas in town and this was by far the worst spa experience Ever! Not worst massage ever but it was such a bad spa experience it ruined the whole thing. 

The ""room"" I was in should NOT be allowed to be a massage room! It was next door to what I'm assuming is the men's jacuzzi\/communal area. I know this because the volume of men's voices were SO loud. The last thing I want to hear while I'm getting a $140 massage is people talk about their plans to ride the rides at stratosphere later that night, or their Excalibur room cost $300 or someone giving directions to lake mead by taking Sahara to Boulder. Yes, I got all of that information while my masseuse is turing up the ""calming"" music to drown them out and apologizing for the noise. 

Finally 20 mins into my massage I can't take it. All oiled up I ask to be moved into a different room. By the time I get re robed and move rooms its impossible to get relaxed. By the time my massage is over I don't even care to use any of the other spa amenities. So I just head out front to complain about my experience and wait on my BF.

As a local you already receive 30% off all spa services(this is a standard at all casinos). So when I complained about my experience they added an additional 20% off. Where they got 20% from I have no idea because I wasn't dissatisfied 20% I was dissatisfied 100%. They then proceeded to tell me they told the guys to be quiet and keep it down. I was like, wait, what??? You we're telling them to keep quiet while I was in there, before I asked to move myself? So you know that room has issues, I'm obviously not the first to complain and you still put people in there? 

As I'm about to pay they remind me theres a 20% automatic gratuity. So that made complete sense after what just happened?!?!

As you can tell I'm really relaxed and happy from my ""spa"" day.",5,4,2

The food at The Buffet was mediocre; thank goodness for free breakfast vouchers. Unfortunately, they tried to charge us the difference between the breakfast and lunch price, since we missed the breakfast cutoff by one minute. Can you believe that?

This is what we were doing when we last rented a room in June. I apologize for the great detail, but I want you to understand what a horrific experience we had.

Our reservation was for one night to celebrate my sister's 21st birthday. We had two rooms, and pulled up together with our bags in tow to the valet. We waited for about 5 minutes, and were finally approached by a valet attendant, who aggressively asked what we were doing there. We stated that we have reservations and were there to check in. He responded with a very robotic and rude, ""Show me your bags or your reservation."" We told him we had our bags in the trunk, and he continued to be aggressive. I understand they probably have a lot of people taking advantage of the valet service, however, as soon as he realized that we were not one of those people, he should have turned that attitude off. He did not. 

As I started to unload my things and my baby, I asked for a caddy to tote our luggage on. They told me I am not allowed to use it. I had to ask why before they would offer me a baggage attendant that would help me. When the baggage attendant approached, I was really hoping he would turn things around. I was sadly disappointed. I loaded our bags onto the caddy, and he was writing, and had never said anything to me or my group, so I assumed we were finished. I proceeded to head inside. He came after me about 3 minutes later, and held his hands out and asked, ""How am I going to get these to you if you don't wait a minute?"" I followed him back out to the valet area. He then accosted me for placing an item on the luggage caddy that wasn't ""in a proper bag"" (it was a box of crackers...) and he rolled his eyes and grabbed a plastic bag and placed the crackers in the bag. He then asked me to count my bags. I did, and I reported the number. He began to explain that the bags could take up to an hour to get to our room, and that me taking them myself was still not an option. In that case, I decided I would need my diaper bag. I removed it from the caddy, and he rolled his eyes again and proceeded to dramatically rip up the ticket and said ""We need to count again."" He then proceeded to tell me that when I got to the room, I would need to call them to bring the bags up. I asked him to just send them now, since we were on our way out, and he said ""We don't do that. You have to be there to accept them."" When I finally was released by the baggage king, we headed to our rooms to ""accept"" our bags that they wouldn't allow us to take by ourselves. I waited on hold for 4 minutes before anyone answered and they demanded a code that was on my paper. I had a baby in my arms, so I asked them to look it up by our room number or reservation since our last name had been taken, but they said they required the code. I told them to wait a second so I could dig it out, and they told me I would have to call back when I was ready...

The rest of the experience continued in that direction. We made a point to avoid all restaurants, bars and gambling in the Golden Nugget since the experience had been so consistent. There is clearly some type of management issue that the staff is not happy with, and as a customer, I felt it. We will not be returning, and we have recommended that our friends and family avoid it as well. We were extremely disappointed, and I really wish I had thought to get names of the people that were so incredibly rude.",10,2,0

Thanked her for teaching us how to play and went about our way to try and regain our luck on the slot machines.

Cocktail service was a bit flighty, but there was a rather rambunctious a couple tables down that seemed to be drawing all the crowd that night. 

We walked past the beautiful atrium area where you can see the large seawater tank and the slide that goes through it. The employees were present throughout the hotel with broom in hand to keep the hotel and casino spotless.

They have a spa too, which looks nice but I haven't indulged in any of their services yet. The casino has a good assortment of games (I play slots and roulette), but the slots weren't loose enough to hold my attention for long.

The pool area was nice, and unfortunately this time I did not get to take the slide down through the shark tank (but definitely plan to on my next visit!)

So to explain, the 3 star rating is simply driven by a horrible check-in experience on arrival (everything else qualified for 4-5 star ratings). They had a medium length line (maybe 10 ppl in front of me), but only one person checking us in at a time. And each person, I swear, took 20 minutes each. So it took almost 2 hours to get checked-in, which truly sucked. The flight to Vegas was only 1.5 hours. On top of that, two other employees at the show ticket counter were not jumping in to help (even though their lines were empty).

So anyways, overall averaged out to 3 stars..

Review #41:
sort of the epi-center of the downtown Fremont St. Experience thing; it has a bit of an old-school vibe, but is not run down at all; in fact, you can tell they are making a real effort here at modernization; nice dining option additions from the Landry's group, such as Vic & Anthony (steakhouse), Cadillac (Mexican), and Grotto (Italian) - I feel like I am back in Houston again!; nice hotel check-in area, backed by the Chart House with a huge aquarium; the outdoor pool area also has a mega-aquarium, and unlike most Vegas casinos, actually keeps their pool area open at night as a spot for drinking & hanging out; I would rate the GN as 3 and 1\/2 stars, but forced by the Yelp system, I must round down as it's not quite a 4-star property yet; best craft beer bet = it's certainly not great, even at the supposed ""beer bar"", but it's not awful either; I snuck next door to the downscale Four Queens, which surprsingly has a Chicago Brewing Co. outpost where you can get decent local drafts to go ($5 for 22 oz.)",4,0,1

For somebody who works on the Strip and has lived here since January, he's really not seen much of Vegas at all, and had never heard of Fremont Street (I know... right?) Well, I made the executive decision to have us go check out Fremont Street, and with that means a trip to Golden Nugget. 

Okay, so I haven't stayed here, but I love this place! It's a really gorgeous casino and frankly, I think it looks nicer, on the inside, than the Wynn. I find the Wynn to be excessively tacky but there's just something about Golden Nugget that I really enjoy. 

This place is really clean and bright. The fact that it doesn't have towering ceilings makes the place feel warm and cozy... if casinos could feel cozy. For the most part, it's pretty easy to find your way around and it's right off Fremont Street so you're close to the action, regardless. 

My favorite thing about Golden Nugget is the pool. Frankly, I think the pool, although smaller, is much cooler than the pool at Surrender (Wynn\/Encore) I remember years ago seeing a show on the Travel Channel about Vegas that featured a shark tank, in the middle of a pool, that had a water slide going through the tank. Up until December, on my first visit, I had no idea where that was even located... it's at this place! It's free to walk around and look at it and I definitely want to check it out this summer. 

Another ""must see"" is the largest golden nugget(s). They're over by the chocolate shop inside the casino, and they're huge! It's a really cool feature and even though I've seen it before, I like going back to check it out.

Throughout the casino, and right across from the nuggets on display,  are Gold ATMs. You can buy gold in various amounts at the daily going rate (about $1,650\/oz in the machine, but you can get it $200 cheaper online.) This would be the only ""investment"" that's a good choice in Vegas. Buy gold, skip the tables. 

The food choices seem solid and the smells wafting through the air are divine. I definitely want to check the Italian place out inside this casino.

On top of everything, the customer service is very friendly and helpful. When Lawrence and I needed directions to the nuggets, we were helped quickly by a front desk guy near the big fish tank restaurant. 

Every time I visit, I get a kick out of this place, and my visit with Lawrence was no exception. Of course I'll be back!",2,0,3

Probably the worst area of the hotel if you have kids.  You would think they'd take this into consideration when grouping rooms for a youth sports tournament. The hotel itself is nice enough, but the noise from Freemont Street is insane. Our room practically shook all weekend from the constant music until 2 am. Fine if you're ready for a party atmosphere, not the best for kids, especially when they need to get some sleep for a sports tournament.  The only silver lining was the Starbucks in the lobby.  Since there was no sleep to be had, at least there was an ample supply of caffeine.  

The front desk clearly knows the noise is horrible, they were not willing to offer a solution or move us.

That was the only thing cool about it and even didn't make up for the rest of it. They do not have enough room at the pool to accommodate the size of the hotel. They are trying to keep up with the strip hotels by drawing people with there cool pool but it isn't working.  You can't enjoy a pool if you don't have a place to sit or to even stash your stuff. I swore I would never take the kids to Las Vegas but they are much older now and the Golden Nugget was off the strip plus the shark tank indicated to me that kids would be more welcome there then say, the MGM. So here I go with my big review so bare with me, I have a lot to say that will hopefully help you.

First of all I paid for priority check-in. They told me that that would guarantee our rooms were connected and that we could check-in earlier. We arrived at 11:00am and I knew there wasn't anyway that rooms would be ready but they told me to check back in an hour.  We left our bags at the counter and went exploring. I came back at noon and still no room, still no problem because I knew check in time was at 4:00pm and even though we had priority check-in I certainly didn't expect rooms to be ready. They took my number and said they would call by 2:30pm. Fine, but I did think that wasn't exactly 'early' check-in.  They knew we were arriving at 11:00am and told me over the phone that we would have pre-assigned rooms.  Still no call at 2:30pm so I went back to the desk and once again, still no room. Again they told me they would call by 3:00pm. Still no call at 3:00pm.  Now I have four tired kids and an annoyed husband and I was pissed. I went back to the front desk for a FIFTH time and they said still no room. I asked them why I had paid for priority check-in if we actually didn't get to check-in early and we didn't have pre-assigned rooms. The front desk person went and got the manager and she came out and looked on the computer and told me that we did have pre-assigned rooms but they had granted the guests in one of the rooms A LATE CHECK OUT!  I am not a person to yell but I friggin' lost it.  Why the hell would you grant a late check out to guests in a room that was supposed to be pre-assigned for early check in?!  They scrambled and found connecting rooms with one of the rooms cleaned so we could take our stuff up....and they refunded my priority check in fees.

Second, our rooms keys worked intermittently.  We had to go to the front desk several times for new card keys.  You need your card key to get into the pool. One morning the five of us went down to the pool early (to try to get a couple chairs) but my oldest son wanted to come down later. When he got to the pool his card key didn't work. A line started building behind him and when the 'security' woman ran the card she said very loudly 'nope!' and then ran it again and said 'nope!' a couple more times. He was horribly embarrassed. He told her his parents were already at the pool and could he just please go find them and bring them back and she told him absolutely not and then yelled 'next!' so she could continue to check in other guests. He went back up to our room and sat in the hall. He couldn't call us because since he was going to the pool he hadn't brought his phone with him . Luckily my husband realized it had been about 45 mins since we had come down to the pool so he went to look for Jack and that's when he found him sitting in the hall. My husband was furious but by the time we got back down to the pool the woman was gone and there was a new dude checking people in. I got the chick's name, Mary Ellen, and wrote a letter to the Golden Nugget but never heard back.

The cost of the rooms was fairly reasonable but if you want to go to the strip a couple times then you need to add in the cost of transportation back and forth which isn't cheap.  The Luxor was pretty close to the same room rate it's a lot closer to the action.  Fremont is cool but not 5-days-in-a-row cool.",7,1,1

My husband booked it through Trivago (actually Amoma, an overseas affiliate).  Eh, the price was good and we were promised a deluxe standard suite in the Carson Tower.  The Carson has the oldest rooms, but for what we were paying, that was okay with us.

TIP:  THE GUEST PARKING GARAGE
Good thing I scanned some reviews and read about how you have to have proof of booking\/registration to show the attendant at the entrance.  They will not let you in without having something to show them.  ""But, I'm checking in!"" is not good enough.  We saw them turn away the two cars ahead of us.
We had our hotel voucher on my phone's email app to show them.  ""Welcome!""

Registration:
The lady checking us in didn't even want to look at the voucher.
""All we have for you is a Standard room"".
She did offer an upgrade to the Rush Tower for an additional $40 a night.
Eh.  That's okay, we just took the what they gave us.  We were just glad to get a room because we found out a week earlier that sometimes, booking through Amoma can get sketchy.  
Take note that their resort fee is a separate payment if you book through one of those hotel sites.

The room was nice and it was away from all the noise down below on Fremont.
No complaints.

The layout of the hotel's main floor was too much this-way-that-way.  
I kept getting lost in that maze.  (Note-  I easily reached my daily walking goal just within the hotel.  LOL) 
We were soon saying that maybe we should have stayed at one of our regular smaller hotels.
I did like being right there on Fremont though.  And having two Starbucks.
We weren't interested in trying out any of their eateries because we already had other places bookmarked for every meal while there.

As for the casino, it's spread out with a lot of playing areas.  Mostly penny machines.  I did find my favorite old-school nickel slots, The Frog Prince in one of the walkways.  The Frog Prince loves me.  That a-hole, Willy Wonka, not so much.  I enjoyed playing the slots in the quieter early morning hours.

There's a small quibble I have and I'll be the first to admit it's a personal phobia of mine.
Overly conscientious attendants in the ladies' restrooms.
You come out of the stall after doing your thing and sometimes, they were right there.  Waiting.
I tend to get performance anxieties knowing they can hear every little sound!  There were a few times I went all the way up to our room instead!  
The hubby said that wasn't the case in the mens' room.   

Overall, the hotel was nice, but not what we usually would go for.",9,4,5

The bed is super comfy with high end sheets and bedding.  For the price - this place can not be beat.  The hotel offers several pretty good dining options - we always has a good meal.  Good table games and slots.  Two pools - the big shark tank - which was OVER RUN by tons of kids. They do have a small adult pool - but get this - you have to have a reservation for chaise lounge or cabana to use it before 5pm everyday - which is not cool.

It is a short walk away from the bus stop, but the bus ride to the middle of the strip will take about 45 minutes with all of the stops in between. The rooms are nice and comfortable, and all of the staff is nothing but friendly.  Of course you have your individuals in the lobby trying to sell their time shares, but that's Vegas. Besides, they have some really good deals on show tickets if you take the time to listen to them. My suggestion is for cheap drinks step right across the way to Binions.

They had Asian, Italian, Mexican, sandwiches, a carving station, salad\/fruit bar, dessert and ice cream area. Overall the food was ok.

Not dirty dumpy, just tired and needing a renovation dumpy.

In addition, like the Caesar's properties they advertise not having a resort fee, but as of July 1st they now charge a 'Fremont Experience' fee. Giving that mandatory fees are now a given (lame, but that's the case in Vegas now) I'm not mad that they are charging a fee, but just call it a resort fee rather than make up another name for it. Since the Fremont experience is attached to their hotel it's like going to another hotel and them charging for an 'awning' fee .. because its there.

Finally, I asked for a wake up call, which they didn't make, then 30 minutes AFTER the wakeup call housekeeping came by and banged on the door calling that my wakeup call (?) even though I had do not disturb on my door. 

They do have a pretty spectacular pool that is big enough to handle huge July 4th crowds (to some extent.. I went when they opened at 10am and every seat was taken, but I went there again around 8pm and plenty of open seats). You get to swim right up to a shark tank, and if you want, you can take a slide down THROUGH the shark tank (long line, so I didn't do this part). 

I do prefer downtown Vegas over the strip so I will be back in this area, and would not cross Golden Nugget off my list.

As of March 1, 2007 the pool is not open yet, there is a small detour due to construction to get to self parking, and they shut the water off from 1-5 am for two nights while I was there.  You get what you pay for.  I went through Priceline, and I think that's why when I checked in, did not get my choice of non-smoking room the first night.

Part of the ENAMEL ON THE TUB HAD CRACKED, revealing the metal base, which had RUSTED COMPLETELY OVER.

The AIR-CONDITIONER WAS ONE OF THE LOUDEST I have ever heard and woke us up several times throughout the night.

One of the PARKING STAFF WAS RUDE and lectured us about not having taken a ticket the night before (even though it was another member of the parking staff who had ushered us past the ticket machine the night before because the lot was ""full"" and only available for hotel guests - he only asked to see our room key).

The HOSTESS AT CARSON CAFE WAS RUDE!  The morning of check-out we were eager to leave, so we woke up early, packed up, and went to the Carson Cafe (24 hour restaurant) to eat before heading out.  It was 8:00am ... in Vegas.  Needless to say, there were very few people in the restaurant, yet the hostess felt justified in seating us right inside the entrance to the restaurant ... where every entering diner would walk right past us and there was nothing to look at other than the cashier.  I calmly asked if we could sit along the edge of the restaurant that looked into the lobby\/casino area.  The hostess ROLLED HER EYES AT ME then wordlessly walked us to a decent table (one where we could dine without having our dining experience intruded upon by all entering diners).  The food was expectedly utilitarian, so no surprise or disappointment there

Final tidbits of irritation: 1) the CARPETS were faded and discolored, 2) the wireless INTERNET IS NOT FREE - it is $13\/day, 3) the BATH TOWELS were the smallest I've ever had the displeasure of using at a hotel, 4) there is NO REFRIGERATOR in the room.

Upside: VERY COOL SHARK SLIDE AT THE POOL, though I cannot speak to the pool's cleanliness since we did not use it.

This may be the best hotel that Downtown has to offer, but if you decide to stay here, please do so with realistic expectations ... THIS IS A 3-STAR HOTEL AT BEST.

If you're in the Rush Tower, you can enter off Bridger and check in near the valet for Rush Tower in the back.  It was a little busy but they had ample staff assisting.  Our request was satisfied, directions to our tower\/room was perfect. We stayed in the Carson Tower (older of the two), view of the Downtown Events Center that The D Hotel owns. There was a MMA event going on but it was not disturbingly noisy. Our floor was quite quiet. I felt safe, it was clean, upgraded, ample drawers and closet space. Hotel was nice. Casino floor is cramped a bit, so don't expect to easily navigate as the aisles\/rows are a tight squeeze especially at night and on the weekends at all hours. Many restaurant options here including Claim Jumper, Cadillac Restaurant and Bar, and The Grotto to name a few.  What I did like is the temporary table set up near the pool entrance  in the morning serving coffee, beignets, juice, etc for under $5.00!  I got 6 beignets for $4.00 which I shared w\/ my family, and a coffee for $3.00. The Starbucks line was ridiculous in the back by our tower so I went to the table and it was great!  I'm not sure if it's set up every day in the mornings, or just the weekends, but highly convenient.  The actual nugget of gold is located around the corner from Vic & Anthony's steakhouse and The Chocolate box.  There is a machine across from the gold display that will kick out actual gold pieces if you so wish to purchase them.  Try the slot machines there too, they're hot!

Room was nice...TV was 42"" but only had local channels and a handfull of cable...no HBO....but I saw that the cabanas in the pool area had TVs with almost 100 channels....wtf??

Soon after checkin I had to get a six-pack of beer and another bag out of the car and on the way back to the room I stopped by the ""H2O"" pool and hot tub facility, and I asked where the towel area was and a ""security"" employee brusquely said ""not with that beer.""  Excuse me..I did not see any signs as to what is prohibited at any entrance to this area.  I was planning to go to the H2O after I dropped my items off in the room anyway.
 
The next evening at 8 in the evening I returned and entered the main pool.  As I approached the fountain, this same individual I had dealt with the previous day rudely told me, ""Buddy this is closed.""  Hotel employees do not call guests ""buddy""; I am not his buddy and I found that offensive.  ""Sir"" is more appropriate.  Tool may have been supposedly trying to do his job, but it was apperent he was on a power trip.   said ""I'm easy to get along with.""  No sir, I don't know you and don't care to, and you were trying to be a horse's ass to a paying customer and guest who had spent a lot of money in rooms and other hotel facilities to that point.  He wanted me to go to the upstairs pool, but I did not want to interrupt the young girls and their Olympic training session. I specifically wanted to go in the fountain pool, away from the fustercluck of the hot tub and upstairs.    Upon exiting, I threw the towel back into the pool for douchebag to fetch.
 
Fault also lies with the hotel.  Again, I did not see signs at any point of entry in the H2O area indicating this area was closed nor for items that were prohibited or other rules, and if there were or had I seen any I would have abided by these. Also, barricades would have been helpful if the hotel was to discourage anyone from entering that pool at that time.

I originally booked a double and when I checked in I was given a king bed, just one. I was told that they would ""graciously let me have a roll away bed for free for this night only"". Um, so they were doing me a favor? No shit it should be free, they already messed up my original reservation. After arriving to the king room, there was blood in the bathroom. 2 large splats on the door. I walked downstairs to talk to the manager to just let him know how disappointed I was within the hour I had arrived. He said there was nothing he could do but said he could send someone up to clean the blood. So wait, did they not clean it before? I laughed. He then said he could give me 2 free buffets even tho I was with a group of 4. He said he could move me the following day in the afternoon to which I agreed.

Following day, we moved to the double. Yay, we're happy. Then we decided to order some grub. If you look at the cover of the room service menu, it clearly says that if there is something you would like that is not on the menu they will do their very best to accommodate your needs. My sister who did not want any red meat, asked if they could make a chicken sandwich for her since it's not on the menu. The lady replied no but they had chicken pasta. Not the same thing at all. My sister then asked, ""Well can you just make a chicken breast for me and bring me a bun?"" The lady replied no. At that point it seemed like the employees there were intentionally trying to piss people off or just be rude.

The next day, we ordered another round of food, late night. We called around 4 am to order food and within a second of hanging up we decided we wanted to cancel. We called and asked the lady to please cancel the order and she got very angry with us and told us the order had already been placed and there was nothing she could do and then hung up.

Overall I was VERY let down. I had high hopes for this hotel. The pool is super cool, although small, it has a cool slide through the shark tank and good drinks, but, I will never reserve a room here again.

The positives:
- the pool, if you reserve space because it is slammed.
- Rooms in the Carson Tower were clean, minus the odor. (more on that later.)

The Negatives:
- The elevators in the Carson Tower for floors 9-20+ were not all operational. This meant there were lines to go up in the elevators, as well as loooooong waits to ride down to the casino floor. 
- The odor in the room was funky. We couldn't figure it out until we smelled the towels and sheets. Whatever detergent the hotel uses leaves behind a weird odor. It is a combination of musty and old laundry smell. Not pleasant. 
- it took 45 minutes for a bellman to appear at the desk to retrieve luggage for our party and another person. We were told that somebody was on there way 5 different times.

- Coffee maker in the room, yay! A $10 charge if you decided to open their little box and use the 2 k-cups to make the coffee.

But like Brigid C. mentioned as well as other reviewers mentioned the Golden Nugget is still under construction.  Probably explains the ultra cheap price.  It didn't bother us too much since we hardly spent anytime in our hotel.  I am really upset that I did not get to enjoy the crazy water slide aquarium that they are so tediously working on.  When it will be completed you will be able to go down a tube slide through an aquarium with sharks.  How crazy is that?!,1,0,0

A late-night ""we could go to California"" suggestion ended with my ""...or Vegas,"" and before I knew it, my handsome companion and I had a room booked at The Nug (thank you, Hotwire) and were on the road. 

I was expecting typical Fremont Street Filth and to be calling this place ""Golden Fuggit"" or ""Golden Suggit"" by the end of our stay, but the room was actually lovely, huge and comfortable with high-end furnishings and a nice bathroom.  I hate The Strip's congestion and since my Vegas activities rarely involve The Strip, I tend to stay downtown; The Nug rooms are definitely not as poopy as The Plaza's (Biff's!) or other Fremont hotels, closer to say, a Station property.  Super clean carpets and no musty smells.  Hotwire's rating was four stars and I pretty much agree.  Parking is easy and free, and you're right in the middle of all the Fremont freakiness.

They checked us in hours early, too.  The indoor pool (The Tank) is feeching tight.  The casinos and restaurants were all so much better than I had ever expected.  Love.

So, the Golden Nugget on Freemont has been recently renovated. No bad  old smokey casino smell anywhere to be found,  replaced by fancy decorations everywhere.

We got a room in the new tower for only $65 a night and the room was beautiful. Very modern and comparable to The Hotel at Mandalay bay but for a fraction of the price. It was beautiful.

The hotel is also filled with beautiful and fancy restaurants everywhere. Just walking around there made me hungry. They even have a cute chocolate boutique and other nice shops.

The pool is also amazing! They have a shark tank in the middle of the pool and you can even take a water slide THROUGH the shark tank....THROUGH. It was awesome.

 We rented a cabana up in the Hide Out at H2O ( adults only part of pool). It was $175 for a week day and $250 for the weekend. The cabana was the way to go and the adult only pool was absolutely what we were looking for. They provide you with 2 sun chairs are room for up to 6 people. They have a flat screen TV and gave us a meat\/cheese\/fruit tray as well as waters. Make sure to request for the larger cabana (up to 12) it is the same price but is given upon request.

All in all one of my favorite stay-cations in a while. If you are looking for a solid time check it out! You will not be dissapointed",6,1,1

When you book you think you're getting a four star hotel, then guess what? When you get there the fee you paid was for the old, Carson Tower.. (our room has crumbling popcorn ceilings (asbestos? I hope not) and without even a desk or fridge.. Decidedly two star. ) If you want the better four-star room, you have to pay an additional $19\/ night. The old Bait and Switch.. very frustrating.. Good beds, though!

In our bathroom alone, the sink was cracked almost in half, the door levers are tarnished, toilet old and broken (a real chug-a-lug) and towels stained brown and threadbare. Unbelievable. When I called Roxanne, she was sorry about the sink but staunchly defended the hotel's four-star rating, saying three times it was rated by AAA, etc.. I guess a customer in a room's opinion doesn't matter.

Housekeeping: 5 pm and when we got back to our room. no housekeeping service had been done, wet towels were still on floor.. I called Sharon in housekeeping and she had no reason for this and said she thought we had checked out. No, we're here two more days!! Then early one morning they're pounding at out door at the strike of 9 am. Isn't this a casino hotel where guests sleep in? Then they left no coffee cups.. The Keurig coffee cartridges cost $2.50 each (39 cents at Costco) so bring your own.

POOL: In the morning my friend and I wanted to sit at the pool and have a drink before exploring.. At 9:25 a.m. there was only about 30 people at the pool, but guess what? People have reserved for themselves every single chaise lounge (Approx. 200 or so of them)  by putting a book, hat, or towel from their room on them.. What about the morning guests? I found out later that they do this so they can try to sell day beds by the upper pool for $200 each. (You can stay three nights at the hotel for that amount!) Well it's a busy Sunday and they've only rented one (out of about twelve!) leaving lots of these huge beds wide open, while just one level below, dozens of people stand around chaise-less.. It's very sad, indeed..At 5 pm they let everyone and anyone into the pool area.. four gang members (and a baby) entered, who said they were from NW Vegas and took the four chaises next to us.. pants sagging low, throwing gang signs, we got a little nervous and left..

WIFI:  the wifi in your room costs $12.99 per room\/ per day\/ PER DEVICE!! I am a normal, connected person with an iphone, ipad, macbook.. Those three devices (and my roommate's two) would have cost us $64.95 a day just for wifi! Does this seem fair?? (Roxanne the manager did help me out a bit on this issue, thanks so much!)

In the parking garage, the closest, premium parking spots are all empty and reserved for the managers, directors, etc.. making the paying customers park up a few levels. This is so they don't  have to use the garage elevators, one broken, the other slow and on it's last leg..We waited six minutes for the elevator (there's only six levels!!) It's not even check out time..

BUFFET: The entrees, although salty, are actually quite tasty. But the desserts, which look great, are awful. The apple cobbler is way too sweet and like wallpaper paste. Everyone at my table was spitting out their desserts, not a pretty picture. If you have a larger group, there is a forced 18% gratuity that you have to pay in advance. I like to tip from my heart at the end of the meal.. those buffet workers really deserve it, though!
FOOD: The Carson St. Cafe is decent, good breakfast.. great bread! My over-medium eggs had the white still raw, but the nice waiter replaced them along with some really nice fruit. Avoid the Asian Cuisine restaurant, my cashew chicken was something like $16.95 and was bland, tasted straight out of the Chun King can..

There are many nice employees here, but I was disappointed with our stay..",4,3,2

It was actually the first hotel I stayed in in Vegas and it was nice - even back then. They had decent table games, slots, and a decent restaurant or two. It was a good place to stay for the money if you were willing to stay downtown. 

Fast forward to about 2006. The Nugget is the first casino to start some big-time renovations after being purchased in late 2005. New owner puts $320 million total into three phases which finished in November 2009. What a transformation! The rooms were updated, many new restaurants were added, they built an upstairs with a new nightclub, renewed\/installed a poker room, and installed a huge pool with slide and aquarium in the old center garden area. Additionally, they also added a new tower of rooms. 

With all of the changes this is now a great place to hang out downtown. There is a lot to offer including some good restaurants. Since the initial renovations started, other hotels in the downtown area are starting to follow suit and get rid of some of the old, smokey grossness and opt for a new face-lift. Good job Golden Nugget - way to lead the charge! 

If I found a great deal, I would definitely stay here. It would be a nice place to stay in the summer to take advantage of the pool area since it's a smaller setting than some of the mega-resorts on the strip.

I sat down for a blackjack lesson at noon with ""Martin"", who was awesome and patient - everyone stayed for a few hours and had a lot of fun. Hubby played craps. They have $5 minimums (there's 3s across the street), but it seemed well worth it to me.

Nice selection of slots; the video poker machines in the back have some of the better payouts in the casino.

The buffet was a-OK, though seemed pricey for what you got at dinner. 

The pool is awesome and is the reason I will be staying here the next time I am in Vegas. I don't even like pools.",0,0,0

I wouldn't want the ""strip"" view if you were on lower floors.  Looked just as the picture on the website showed.  Very clean room with upgraded bathroom.  I liked the decor and honestly, it's a great value.  Motel 6 costs more and wouldn't be nearly as nice.  Didn't bother trying to upgrade.  King Bed was really comfy!  Far walk, but I like being away from elevator so not a lot of people walking by --it's quiet.

The GN website says they have robes in these rooms, but there were no robes (maybe you have to call and ask for them?)  There is an ironing board and iron and closet in the safe.  No in-room coffee.  
Beautiful light fixtures throughout.  Did not eat at GN so cannot comment on food, but I thought room service was pretty pricey.  One thing I like is that Golden Nuggest does not charge a RESORT FEE, which is becoming more common.  If you want wi-fi it is $12.95 per 24 hour period.

Pool was heated by the shark tank and it was very pretty.  Very well-kept hotel. 

Love the ""value"" of Fremont Street versus the strip.  Went to the strip for one day and I really can't believe the price difference for everything.  Food on the strip is outrageous.

On Fremont Street, went down to the Golden Gate to DuPar's for breakfast.  It is comparable in price to IHOP.  Spent $25 for two people for a great breakfast.  This place makes it's own preserves and muffins.  It was truly a delicious breakfast and probably the most expensive on Fremont Street, but quality here is A++.  

Also had Paradise Buffet breakfast for $6.95 p.p. at Fremont Station?  (caddy corner across the street from Golden Nugget).  For $6.95 it was a great deal as it includes beverages.  Pretty decor.

Most importantly, everything was clean. I'm a clean freak and I didn't feel grossed out at anytime during my stay. So if at all possible, stay in the newer tower. We got a pretty good rate, mid weekday. 

Knocked one star off because the walls are thin. I can hear the guest next to me using his speakerphone option....at like 6 IN THE MORNING!!!!! Also heard housekeeping clanging some stuff around. Ugh...def not for the light sleepers. But I get it...it IS an older hotel afterall.

Also, I'm not sure maybe their air conditioning on the casino floor blew out the night I was there but it was stuffy as hell!!!!!! The mixture of cigarette smoke + all that body heat from a packed casino floor definitely didn't go so well with me.

The ventilation system in the casino is horrible.  The casino was so smoke filled I tried to spend as little time as I could there.  As another reviewer had said,  the room was dusty.  I brought this to Management's attention along with a list of other issues, but it did not get taken care of.  I had to call down to the front desk 4 times to get the cable on the TV to work.  Each time I was on hold 20 plus minutes.  We were on the 22nd floor (key card floor) on the rush tower.  They key card did not always work.  One member of our party got off on the 19th floor to walk up, but got locked in the stairwell.  We had 4 rooms reserved and all had the same key card issue.   Our king bed needed to be replaced.  It was high in the middle and low on the sides, making me feel like I would roll out of bed. Our friends found left over food in their fridge and jelly beans on their nightstand upon check-in..   In short the cleaning and maintenance was lousy.  On the plus side we enjoyed the Claim Jumper, The Grotto, the Cadillac Bar and the Buffet.  The valet service was also excellent.  I did the fast check out on the TV with no problem.  We were originally in the Carson tower, but upgraded to the Rush Tower.  By upgrading to the Gold floors we eliminated the resort fee.   If you are allergic to down, let them know in advance, as the pillows are down.  That also took several phone calls to fix.

I had no idea things like shark tanks and waterslides through shark tanks and poolside blackjack existed in downtown Vegas. Boy, am I glad I found it out.

For Sir Nicholas' recent birthday I took him on a surprise trip to Vegas. He mentioned the last time we talked about Vegas that he has always wanted to stay in downtown. Our friends Mike and Hazel always mentioned that they stayed in the Golden Nugget. After looking online and discovering that the NICEST rooms were still under $200 a night it was a done deal.

Check in and out was easy peasy. If you stay in the Gold Tower, where we stayed, on the club level floors you have complimentary Wi-Fi, water, coffee, and snacks. The snacks are in the hallway by the elevator, but they are things like apples, nuts, and M&Ms. The pool is nice, with poolside gambling as I mentioned earlier and the ability to rent out cabanas if you want your own private space. The location is also good for downtown, whether you want to stay around the casinos or venture out and discover a little more of the local scene in terms of bars, restaurants, or even arts stuff.

We all came down from Vancouver for my buddy's bachelor party, and when we got to the hotel, they told us they had over-booked and we didn't have our rooms (which we had booked way in advance). They tried to offer us two other rooms, each with a single king-sized bed, but we're 7 guys and that wasn't going to work. So instead, they gave us a free upgrade to the penthouse suite!

It was like having our own luxury apartment in downtown Las Vegas. The suite had two bedrooms, two living rooms, and 6 bathrooms. It was like being a celebrity for a weekend.

The casino itself is great, very professional, but plenty of low-stakes tables and games for beginners. I don't really gamble, but there was a lot to see and do anyway. Also, if you are gambling, they bring you free drinks, so when I did try my luck at the tables, I tried to time it so that I would get a new drink for every $5 that I lost (this worked out pretty well).

The pool and the deck are pretty good, but be aware that there is no shade and it gets to about 100F by noon. Also, all of the deck chairs are taken or reserved by at least 10am so I'd advise getting there early. We ended up sitting in the VIP area (you need to spend at least $200 for the whole group, which actually wasn't that difficult), but even there, there isn't any shade. The shaded cabanas on the upper level start at $350 for the day (!).

Anyways, great hotel and casino, great staff. Excellent Vegas experience. Golden Nugget is not on ""the strip""... it's on Fremont Street, which is the old strip in the downtown area.

They have a Claim Jumper's in the hotel with normal Claim Jumper's prices and for $5 you can get room service from anything off the Claim Jumper's menu.

It cost me a $133 a night which was a good deal for the weekend of Electric Daisy Carnival.

They let me check out at 5pm for $28.

They have a self-serv kiosk for checkin with no lines.

The Bad

Even though I put the privacy door tag, I was repeatedly bothered by the house-cleaning staff.  Please educate them that privacy means do not disturb.

Also, the power outlets are inconveniently located.  I had to move my mattress to charge my cell phone.  I was in Carson Tower 383.

The Windows are really thin so you year all the outside noise like car alarms and people honking their horns out of frustration for not being able to find a parking space in the structure whose capacity can't handle the capacity of the hotel.

When the lot is full, you have to pay $5 to park at the Plaza hotel a block away.

Results

I docked them 1 star for the constant interruptions by staff.  I was at an all-night music festival so the last thing I wanted was to be interrupted multiple times while trying to sleep and having a privacy sign on the door.

I'd give them 5 stars if they where on the strip.  But they're not.  They're downtown and as much as I love being able to walk from casino to casino and all the great neon downtown is just not the place you want to be.   We are all in our 20\/30s and we like to meet new people when we travel and they're just aren't a lot of people our age downtown.  Now we did have a good time at the Griffin but in the end we ended up spending a lot on taxis and still didn't get to meet people the same way we would of on the strip or even one of the off strip places like Hard Rock.

Spa: The amenities like robe and locker room were nice and the decor was luxurious, but the service felt lacking.

I used a Groupon for a 80-minute hot stone massage. This was my first of the kind, so I have nothing to compare it to. The masseuse brushed the area of my skin with a brush (I assume to get rid of dead skin), massaged the area, then smoothed over it with hot stones. It was generally relaxing but it felt rushed--perhaps so, since she ended a full 15 minutes early, and started me 10 minutes late.

They recommend arriving 30 minutes early for the appointment so you can get ready and perhaps use their sauna, steam room, hot tub, showers, or just sit and read a magazine or newspaper. I got there an hour early and it was definitely a good idea. I got to enjoy the water but not the other snacks since all that was left were crumbs. But being in the desert made me SO parched I chugged that H20 like a freakin' camel. And the lotion in the massage hydrated my terribly parched skin!

Had I not used the Groupon, this service would have been about $230, including tip. They automatically include a 30% tip, but you can change it.

Casino: In a word, nice. This is probably the only place worth going to on Fremont Street if you're more of a new-Vegas-Strip-side fan. There are penny slots and people smoke, but doesn't every place have this in Vegas? I might say this casino, while definitely smaller than ones on the strip, was nicer than the LVH.",0,1,0

We stayed in the Golden Tower. The rooms are not too different from other standard rooms on the strip. The location of the hotel is ideal if you want to be right smack in the middle of the Fremont Experience.

We ate at the charthouse right behind the check-in desk and it was a great experience!!! Everything was delicious. I ordered the 12 ounce prime rib, baked potato, and fried macaroni and cheese which came out to be around 45 dollars. Fair price it was really good!!

Room service was disappointing and overpriced for what we got but that's probably the norm with every hotel.

It was $89.27 for a one night stay in a rush tower which was really really nice in my opinion especially the bathroom [huge thing for me]. The only meh thing in my opinion was waiting for the elevators up to the parking structure around check-in\/check-out time since it gets very crowded with only 2 elevators available.

That was my first and last time I will ever stay there. When we arrived we parked valet, which is free of course we tip. Later we left to visit family that lives nearby, we return a little past midnight to find out valet was full, so we were asked to park in anyone of the nearby resort parking lots since their own self park lot was full and we would be reimbursed. When we drove by the Golden Nugget parking we noticed that 2 cars were leaving so we decided to park in there. The next day when we were leaving to another family gathering the parking lot attendant, who seemed to either have mental issues or a drug issue or both, would not turn to look at me. I asked ""do you need my ticket?"" Since guests park there for free and nothing just stared straight. He doesn't turn. I shrug my shoulders confused and starting driving slowly, he yells out ""Are you going somewhere?"". I said ""I asked you if you needed my ticket since I'm a guest"". He says ""Anywhere in the United States it is the law to turn in your ticket, next time you will be arrested for trespassing"". I am so confused and weirded out at this point. He turns and says ""Twenty dollars"" and turns back to staring straight. I said ""I'm a guest here this is my keycard"". He says again ""twenty dollars"" and takes my keycard and ticket turns back to staring straight. This was an absolute WTF moment. I asked him what's his name, he wouldn't turn. Finally after raising my voice and asking 2 more times, he turns and slowly says ""RICARDO"". I drive out so confused and weirded out when I realize hey he didn't give me my keycard and receipt. So instead of confronting him personally, since my kids were already freaked out, I flag down a security explained what happened and he goes to check it out. Comes back about 15 minutes later stating that he did the same thing to a hotel guest behind me. He takes me to the front desk to file a complaint. They decided they would investigate further and call me with the outcome. Later I get a voicemail that tells me I will get reimbursed and resort fees removed. Ok cool, guess what later that evening again there is no parking I had to find one at the Plaza. Next morning I head straight to front desk to check out and get my reimbursement. Well that wasn't easy, cuz I had no receipts. All I had was the ticket. Manager said he couldn't reimburse me for either nights. Wow, I said ""I'm not moving from here until you give me my reimbursement which was promised"". I had the voicemail to show him. Nope he didn't make it easy. Finally after going back and forth he got it approved. Ok thank you for making me feel like I'm trying to come up on something. The whole experience was horrible.

- The pool is awesome. The shark tank and the slide through it are fun as hell.

But they leave the deck and the poolside blackjack tables open... so it's like they are taunting you. LOL

- The casino was nice, a good variety of machines and games, and the location allowed for you to hit multiple properties and see what they had to offer, too.

- The restaurant selection was kinda meh. The coffee shop and buffet were very uninspired and a little spendy for what you got. The Grotto Italian restaurant was good.

- The poker room was intimate and comfortable, with a decent amount of games. The play was choppy, but that's probably because it was full of WSOP-wannabees.

Got to stay and play at G Nug and as usual, there's a lot to do on property! I'm reluctant to give it a nickname, since hotels before have tried to reboot themselves with the hip, locals' nickname to disastrous results. Also, tabloids kinda ruined nicknames with the first initial, first syllable of last name formula. 

There are at least a dozen watering holes to wait for people. And while I did this frequently over the years, I'll focus on 2 of the most important times I've done this on property. Once, behind the Bar 46 wall, I hung out at that inside bar when a bride plopped her flowing gown crying self on the stool next to me. Everyone looked, but they didn't want to say anything. They wanted the guy by himself sitting next to her to test the unpredictable waters first. 

Unfortunately, my first trip to Golden Nugget was after the Wynn days, the Kenny Rogers (pre Joan Rivers face) entertainment director days and even pre Fremont Street Experience (weekend cruising)\/ Jan Jones days. But I have heard the stories many, many times. 

I got to experience 2 rich guys trying their hand at running a casino and branding themselves with a reality show era. But, what was cool was that I got to see the reality show broadcast on the canopy when they aired and as a bonus, Tara Reid got to hang out there and I met her fresh during one of her nip slip (read: her entire boob was out for an extended oblivious amount of time) publicized moments.

The changes over the years have been decent, the Nug seems to be the most financed and first downtown to start the renovations that set the standard for others to follow, which is great. 

You want to know about the bride, but I should begin the second time I waited, too. It was for a guy, yeah yeah. I used to work with him. I hadn't seen him in years, he was always one of those guys we used to give shit to each other at work all the time, hung out at the diamond lounge after work and work some events together. I went to him to get the what for on who's hiring lately.

He always had 4-5 frames going on at the same time, but he had a bit of a gambling problem that kept him from saving any of it. Great service at the bar, it's the bar next to the cashier window that I think people still shock their hand with that stamp machine trying to validate their parking ticket. The bar is also next to the poker room. We always had a cold rivalry, but our meeting was something of a summit, since I\/we finally admitted we were the top 5 competent workers in that over themed restaurant.

Back in the day, I talked to the bride for a bit until we were the center of attention in that corner of the casino, so we left. We walked over to the Hand Of Faith (pre gold vending machine- Wow!), where we gazed and devised a plan to get her out of her hotel room heist style (her fian-psycho parts unknown, BOLO). Ex's are always called psychos, but honestly, isn't that why we hooked up with them to begin with? 

We were able to get some of the people at the bar to canvas the lobby for- wait, what does this have to do with a review of a casino? Random GN patrons banded together to form a rag tag gang, that's what this casino is capable of!

The shark tank was a great addition and ingenious that they have a water slide thru it. The shock is that they can maintain it without people ruining it somehow with vandalism or an accident of some kind. The bars in the lounge areas flow specialty drinks egregiously. 

I suppose I'll have to review the venetian canal ride or the Viva Wedding Chapel to finish about what happened with the ex bride... Man, I didn't even get to meeting Gordie Brown, The Experience in the cafe and the hooker from the heart of Gold Diggers, but they can have their own reviews at least.

Specifically, we've stayed in the Carson  Tower, the Gold Tower, and the Gold Tower Club Rooms.  I have never stayed or seen the Spa or Rush tower rooms.  

While the Carson tower rooms are just nice basic hotel rooms, their location seems to be the most quiet.  There is enough space for two people, easily, and upgrades have been done.  You can snag one of these rooms easily.  

The Gold Tower rooms are a bit more posh and, for these rooms and the Club rooms, how much outside noise depends on where you stay.   The upgrades and space in these rooms are very nice.

So for any of the above mentioned places, I always ask for rooms NOT on the Fremont St side OR on the Pool side (music late at night will echo off the surrounding buildings and into your room).  Do this and you will be much happier if you like your sleep!

We've eaten at several of their restaurants--all really good.  We've never had any problems in the rooms (except for the noise and we asked to move, learned our lesson, and never did that again).  They are upgraded nicely, very decently priced, and very clean and comfortable.  Once we had trouble at check in when they had one of our reservations and not another, but admittedly, I had made several changes so I think one accidentally got cancelled.  Still, I've walked in two other times to add a nice to an existing reservation or to get another room and they been able to accommodate with just a little wait on my part.  Most front desk staff are polite but not overly friendly, but house keeping is helpful and staff in the halls will always say hi.  

Overall, I think this is probably the best place in Downtown to stay and if we weren't moving to Vegas, we would continue to stay here.  I can't speak to their gambling but the people I see on the floor seem to be having a good time. Also, they have a 24 hour Starbucks and are located right on Fremont.

We pre-booked our rooms using a travel website and when we checked in they informed us that the price per night had dropped and we were issued a refund, pretty cool, right? Score.

Yes, I meant to use all caps there--this issue needs to be addressed.

Arriving after midnight, with a wiped-out child in tow, it was simply unacceptable to wait 40 minutes in line in order to get the keys to the room we had prepaid for weeks earlier. What could possibly take them so long? Do they even have computers? They spent ten minutes with each guest checking in; what were they doing, chiseling the contract on stone tablets?

Then, once in our room (which was beautifully furnished and very clean), we discovered that they had provided us with only one bed, despite a reservation for two. A call to the front desk got it resolved with a rollaway, which would have been fine except for the 30 minutes spent on hold! Seriously, 30 minutes just to talk to someone (who, again, was very nice). The actual rollaway delivery happened within five minutes, so no knock on housekeeping. The problem was strictly with the staffing level at the front desk--they were overwhelmed.

Seriously, the rooms are great, the pool is great, the restaurants are fine, but the front desk staffing renders it nearly unusable for a short trip. We were only stopping for one night\/morning, so we spent nearly 10% of our time there waiting for front desk staff to be available. If this is some kind of weird business strategy, I'd love to have it explained. More likely someone's idiot son-in-law has been put in charge of staffing the desk and has decided to cut costs by reducing staffing levels; if so, they have not only cut costs, but also cut this visitor from ever returning.

Housekeeping rarely vacuums the carpet in the rooms.  Yes they'll make the beds, empty the trash and change the linens.  There's this one pretzel that's been just underneath the bed for two days that any vacuum cleaner would have obliterated.

Speaking of housekeeping, today as I was in the bathroom and as my wife slept, they came barging in without warning.

Some of these things are not the hotel's fault, for instance the idiot who called my room around midnight stating that he occupied the room previously and left items in the safe.  (Eastern European accent)

The bartender in the casino who wouldn't comp me a beer even though I was playing video poker, making the maximum bets.  He said I needed to put more money in the machine.  Hell, I started off with a hundred!  I can't help that it's gotten down to $3.75 while you are flirting with a waitress..

Gold Digger's night club turned me away for wearing a bandana.  I am there once a year for a birthday party at the end of April.  Had on a bandana each time.

It's Sunday, Gold Digger's  is empty (except for my friends), I'm 53 years old and I get carded then turned away.

The bathtubs always have slow drains.  All of them.

Neither one of the card keys worked well on the doors.  Five swipes minimum to gain entry to the room.  Went to the front desk and had them replaced.  Same problem.

Did I mention that this is a very nice hotel?

I got in early Wednesday but as expected, there were no rooms clean.  I was offered and upgrade to the Gold tower for $20.00 extra per night.

My friends got in late Thursday and the Carson rooms were sold out, they all were upgraded to the Gold tower for no extra charge.

The group I was with all ordered different drinks and all was good until my wife asked the bartender for an outlet for her charger. The bartender replied ""We don't have any because they are all being used by appliances"". What the bartender didn't know was that the mirrors behind the bar showed four unused outlets! She lied! We would have preferred a ""No"" or ""it's against policy"" but she lied. -1 star for that.

Last night, while staying at the Golden Nugget, we were robbed. It happened after we went to sleep, while we were in the room. Deadbolt you doors. Lesson learned! So scary!!!! The hotel staff were rude, not helpful and downright disgraceful. I assumed the security staff would call the police or know how to handle the incident. We wrote out a report and then later I found out they had not called the police. We were given no procedures or helpful advice. None! Funny thing was when I spoke with the desk manager in the morning, about the rudeness, he was more concerned that the charges for out room got posted to our cancelled credit card. Oh, he tried to say the right things all while making sure the payment was good., barely making eye contact. So disappointed,  I would NEVER have so little empathy for anyone. I did not ask for anything from them financially so it is not like they were trying to get out of something and all I got was nothing but condescending, begrudged assistance. 

I wanted to add an update, just after this review, I received a call from the Golden Nugget. The lady was very nice and apologized. After a long conversation where I explained that they should have a policy and some printed material for their guests should this happen to anyone else (i.e. What to do if they steal your I.D. and you have to get on a plane, etc.) she offered a refund and a free stay, which she was going to email (I guess she forgot to send it, apparently not important). 

I wonder, do they know what a toll this has taken on my husband and I? We no longer have a sense of safety. Sleeping is a nightmare! We have anger that because their security did not call the police, the robbers got away with our cash and wallets. Turns out that while security was in our room they were using my credit card to get a cab. If security had been doing their job, we might have had our possessions back. Also, we were on a private floor, there had to have been surveillance, something!  I feel that their lack of security caused this, and I have my suspicions it may have been an inside job, as my purse with no money or regular credit cards was taken, (makes me wonder who went through my stuff previously to know that) the failure of security to do anything, the access key to the private floor and our room, the rudeness management to try to make me feel somehow responsible (I was told at one point by management that they would probably find out we were robbed by our traveling companions, friends of ours for 20 plus years and 10 plus years) and then their pretense to listen, make changes to their policy but obviously an email was even too much! The reason for this update is that with each sleepless night it is impossible not to replay all of the insults in our heads.

The standard rooms in the Carson Tower (formerly the South Tower) are just fine. But it's worth the extra money to upgrade to the Gold Tower (formerly the North Tower). The furnishings are better, you'll get an extra TV in the bathroom, and the location is right off the casino floor. This may not sound important, but all the walking back and forth really adds up. It's nice to step right off the elevator and be in the middle of the action. If you want to upgrade even more, stay in the newly constructed Rush Towers (bordering Carson St, on the Clark County Detention Center side of the bldg.). It's a bit of a walk from Fremont Street and the main part of the casino, but the rooms are absolutely stunning with great views of the Strip and surrounding areas. 

I often travel solo for business and find the Golden Nugget is one of the best places for solo travelers. All of the employees are friendly and there are numerous places to eat. I tend to flock towards the H2O Lounge next to the Chart House restaurant. There you can sit at the bar with other solo travelers and enjoy some fresh cooked meals brought right to you from a Chart House server. I've tried several dishes and above all would recommend the Macadamia crusted Mahi. Also love the East Meets West Tuna and Coconut Crunchy Shrimp. I had the Lobster Grilled Cheese and it was good, but a little on the soggy side. 

I'm not a pool person, but this pool is so nice I usually pay it a visit. Sometimes I'll just lounge out there in jeans (when it's not too hot) and enjoy the music and sounds of happy tourists. They also have outdoor blackjack right by the pool if you're in the mood. 

Other amenities include not one but two Starbucks. An excellent sushi restaurant called Red Sushi (they stole the chef away from the Rio's sushi bar). Grotto, for some excellent Italian at a decent price. And the Carson Street Café for an eclectic mix of quick food (ideal for breakfast). And you absolutely must try Vic & Anthony's Steak House (see my separate review on this outstanding establishment).

You usually receive a coupon book at check-in with match plays and decent discounts off the restaurants. There are usually some other surprises in there as well. 

All in all, the perfect place to call your Vegas home away from home. So why not five stars?? Only one reason: the check-in line can be extraordinarily long - like an hour or more. I know a lot of people have complained about the long waits. I wish they would fix this problem, but that is the only drawback. If you can get VIP check-in, this place is a five star joint in my book.",7,0,0

Next if you buy drinking water at the pool then buy the large smart water at the entrance to the pool from the booth selling sun Screen.

I DO NOT BLAME THE WAITRESS at all since I saw her hustling. So whats the wait? She was literally the only waitress on that whole side of the pool! With both incidents happening to me on our weekend there I concluded that either Golden Nugget is way under staffed or they have serious managerial issues.",4,1,1

I think most people either really love downtown or they hate it. I am a strange one where I am ambivalent about it. I certainly dont love it, but I dont hate it either.

Luckily we opted to book a room with VIP check in which sped the process up exponentially. That said, check in time is 3 and our room wasn't ready until after 3:30pm. I booked 2 queens and was given 1 king and told rooms were sold out so nothing they could do, even though it's not what I booked when I booked 3 months in advance.

Staff isn't overly friendly and unaccommodating when mistakes are made, albeit it's not a 5 star hotel so I guess we shouldn't be surprised there.

We stayed in a gold club room for 3x the price of the standard room...The room is on the club level in the Carson tower which we've since learned 'club' only means you're paying additional for all day snacks that sit on a table outside the elevator on the club level floor...snacks like peanuts, jelly beans and m-n-ms and water. Nothing special. Room is decorated modern decor. No fridge , no mini bar, is small, tub not large as described and plumbing fixtures wobbly with the bath\/shower option knob, broken.

One thing not mentioned at check in is the VERY LOUD construction noise happening in the main tower that begins at 5am! Yes, I said 5am. If you're a light sleeper like me, avoid this hotel completely until renovations are complete. Although you may have a hard time getting an honest answer as to when that will be. The front desk was not apologetic or honest about what the noise was until I said , ""are you stating you're not aware there is major construction happening on your grounds""??? They hemmed and hawed saying oh, yes but ""usually""'they don't start making noise until 9:30am. Clearly not true b\/c management is aware of when the workers check in. There are cameras everywhere and a check in policy for personnel. Why check a crew in at 5am if they won't start work until 9:30? Simply not true.

I have heard of young ones staying at the Golden Nugget b\/c rooms were inexpensive and when you're young and in Vegas, you probably don't plan on sleeping or being in the room much if at all.  With that being said, I seriously thought the hotel was similar to a cheap motel just from the stories I've heard in the past.  But boy oh boy, this place has great potential!  

When I stumbled upon the hotel and casino, I was amazed at how pretty it was inside!  I was totally expecting it to be all old and rundown, like a ghost town, etc. The casino is nice and the fixtures\/furnishings\/design seems to have been updated (though I've never seen what it might have looked like in the past).  

Pool - Didn't get a chance to walk around and explore it, but by being a spectator from the outside looking in, it looked a lot of fun and I really wanted to go for a swim but there was just no time.  :[  There is a freaking waterslide that goes THROUGH the shark tank!  YES, there are SHARKS!!!  (and some fish).  The pool wraps around the tank and has sunny and shady areas.  There are daybeds and chaises that are in the water as well as normal ones on the deck.  I also noticed that there were multiple levels (upper level it seemed like there were actual cabanas there).  

Restaurants - Don't knock 'em till you try 'em.  It took a while for us to figure out where we wanted to eat because the menus don't really sound all that appetizing, but when we ate at this Italian restaurant, the food was actually really good.  I didn't order a dish for myself because I wasn't feeling well, so the waitress gave me this drink that would help me feel better (and it did).  The bread w\/ the olive oil dipping sauce was pretty yummy and I got a chance to try some of my  Mom's dish (some type of pasta) it wasn't bad.  My friend ordered I think the Eggplant Parmesan?  

Bathrooms - I noticed that the two casino level restrooms were different - one seemed a little nicer and more lit than the other, but nonetheless, they were both clean.  

Location - Not sure if its in the best area necessarily... it is right next to the Clark County Metropolitan Police Department\/Facility... steps away from the Court House, etc.  During the day I would say its fine, but it looks so sketch at night.  

Airport Shuttle - If you schedule an appt. with the Showtime Shuttle Service, they can take you directly to the airport.  

Greyhound - Not too far from the hotel & casino if you choose to take the bus back home.

Starbucks - Yes, there is one located downstairs.

Rooms - My Mom had said that she booked a room in the older part of the hotel... I was dreading what it was going to look like, but when I walked in, it literally wasn't as bad as I had pictured it in my head.  The room seemed to be updated?  I wasn't afraid to sit down anywhere nor sleep in the bed.  The room had a good amount of walking space.  The bathroom wasn't scary at all either... the only thing I could probably complain about were the bath fixtures... maybe they can update those soon?  :D  Dirty bathrooms freak me out but I was okay with this one, lol.  

The Guests\/People - I initially thought that I would be seeing a lot of elderly guests wandering around, but to my surprise there were people of all ages roaming around and hanging out!  From families w\/ kids to teens, people in their mid-20s-30's to 40's-60's to Grandpa & Grandma status.  

The Elevators - They're pretty quick and they don't look rundown or outdated at all.  The waiting area near the elevators was also nice... pretty painting and lighting above.",12,1,3

I have been coming to Las Vegas since I was 21 and 99.99% of the time I have stayed at the Golden Nugget. To me Downtown in Vegas and the strip is an amusement park. 

My girlfriend and I booked our room via Expedia and locked in at $79.00 a night for just above a basic room. We figured the less money we spend on a room the more money we will have to live the life fantastic. 

We arrived at check-in and I mentioned to Ryan how long I have been coming to the Golden Nugget, I also mentioned to Ryan how I try and send as much business there way via my Yelp reviews. After I dropped all of that information I then asked Ryan if there were any room upgrades available. I was honestly expecting to have to fork out a few dollars more but that was not the case. Ryan simply said we have upgraded your room to one of our suites, not sure what type of suite it was I asked, what is the charge, Ryan told us 'No Charge.' 

We headed to the elevators which were literally located right next to High Roller Slot section of the casino. We headed to room with no idea of what to expect when we opened the doors. When we did in fact open the doors we were shocked (in a very good way) at what type of suite we were given. We were upgraded from a Gold Tower basic room ($79.00 a night during a weekday, $179.00 a night during the weekend) to a Parlor Suite ($179.00 a night during a weekday, $279.00 a night during the weekend). 

We walked in to find a HUGE bathroom with a Jacuzzi bathtub. The bathroom had a separated vanity area. Out bedroom has a large King sized bed, mirrored walls, large closet, a digital safe, desk & 42"" flat screen Television. As we continued walking around the room my girlfriend said 'Oh my goodness' the door separating our room from the room next door (you know those doors) is open. We knocked on the door we connected both of our rooms to alert the person who might be staying there that our shared door was open, little did we know this was still our room. This area contained a separate dining room, living room, wet bar, refrigerator, wine glasses, an additional closet, another 42"" flat screen television and a view of the Fremont Street Experience. 

This made our trip so much better, we were treated like Royalty from the moment we valeted our vehicle to the moment we left the Casino to head home. As for the Casino it has more of a down to earth feel to it. The games are bunched closer together to give you the vibe of a party going on which is exactly what is going on. This will not be my last trip to Las Vegas and without question when I come back I will be staying at The Golden Nugget.

Sometimes the sharks will freak out swim all over the place when someone rides the slide. However this wont really happen when mobs of people aren't going down the slide all day, you need to lull them into a false sense of security then... BAM! scare the fish crap out of them.

Another cool little thing to check out if you're in the neighborhood is the world's largest nugget of gold on display which is in the lobby. As a side note, does anyone else find it ridiculous that it was found only a foot underground?!

First, my main reason for staying here was because of their pool\/aquarium\/water slide. We go to check in, just to find out that the slide is having work done and closed, along with the aquarium. We were very disappointed because NOWHERE on the website does it mention that it's down for 3 months. If we knew that, we would not have stayed there. Also, there is very limited seating on chairs at the pool. We went down to the pool 3 different times and never were able to find a lounge chair that was not used. Or we could rent one for $30 each at the 21 and over pool. They also charge a ridiculous resort fee per day that you can not find anywhere on the website before booking. What they say the resort fee includes, is not worth it AT ALL. Especially when their one advertised feature(water slide) is down and not working. A lot of the staff was rude, especially at their Starbucks downstairs. They also let kids in to the hot tub, when it clearly says 16 and over. It was annoying to share a hot tub with kids jumping in and splashing. Not nearly enough to do on Fremont street as they make it seem. I will not be staying here again, even though I really would like to try the water slide. I would rather pay more for a nicer hotel then cheap out and get stuck here again.",0,0,0

We booked a luxury pool cabana for their infamous shark tank pool. As we check in for our wrist bands, employee tells us ""no outside food or drink"" which we take to mean we have to purchase everything through the pool menu. We were dying for coffee and a piece of toast or bagel (10 a.m.) We get all the way up to the Cabana, and they tell us ""we don't have coffee, go get it at Starbucks"". Well, we were told no outside food or drink ""oh, that means not outside the casino""--gee, that explanation would've been helpful. 

Also, we've stayed at hotels all over the world, and always get pool cabanas and this is the first time we've experienced one that doesn't serve coffee. ""Luxury Cabana"" this is not--it's also the only cabana experience we've had that doesn't offer an option to dial a number for service. You're at the mercy of when the server comes by. Thankfully, our attendant was good.

So I schlepped all the way down again, got coffee and came all the way back up. Food and drinks were good. Shark slide was fun. Just remember, you'll have to walk barefoot up to the elevator (which is super gross) to get back to your cabana. Yuck.

Elevators throughout the hotel were a mess--slow, shakey, and two just broke down. This was true for the garage, the hotel itself and the pool (the lifeguard said he was embarrassed by the pool elevator squeaking and shaking).

Also, be aware that Starbucks in Vegas hotels is much more expensive than regular Starbucks--$7 for a breakfast sandwich, This hotel has 2 Starbucks--one that is always out of bagels and croissants, and another which has it all, but no microwave or toaster. WTF???

I'm also sick and tired of Landry's promises of room upgrades with the Landry's card. Not once has this been honored. There is always an excuse i.e., there's a game, there's a convention--when is that not the case in Vegas? We're signing up for other loyalty brand cards, this one isn't worth it.",1,0,0

Well, it's hard to say, but best experienced!

Downtown Las Vegas does have its share of hidden gems, and the H20 Bar in Golden Nugget is certainly one of them! While initially going in just to see this indoor water slide, my group of friends decided to stay here and chill by the poolside. The pool area offers up beach chairs, towels, and plenty of space to relax with your friends. There were areas where we could put our feet into a hot steamy tub, which was strangely fitting even on a hot day.

To top it off, the drinks here were great! Smoothie drinks with shots of 180 octane for only $8... you can choose from flavors including Strawberry Lemonade. We each got a drink and took over a whole area with couch pillows and waterside views... and with more alcohol comes more rowdiness than a whole day club could handle.

Had a real good time at Golden Nugget. The nugget itself was much more interesting after knocking back two or three smoothies.

The room wasn't more than $150 a night and could've slept 4 because there was a king bed and a couch. 

The pool was nice, having a bar outside is fun. The casino is great!!! Since I was new to gambling, I woke up early and took some free lessons they had in the casino. I took lessons in black jack and craps, and I was so happy we took advantage of the free lessons. 

The buffet was nice too, the waiter was so kind and quick to pick up dirty plates. It was also very affordable. We had a nice dinner at the Chart House and sat right by the fish tank. Our meal was pricey but delicious, the only thing I wasn't a fan of was my Moscow Mule. 

The location is great too, it is different than the jam packed strip which I have stayed on before. I went to the Mob Museum and spent a lot of time on Fremont Street.

The rooms are very affordable, and pretty nice! The hotel staff is really nice too. The new Rush Tower has a separate check-in desk, so if you're staying there keep that in mind (it can take a while to get checked in at the regular desk). The Rush Tower rooms are a little more expensive and and little more fancy - they have massive bathrooms which are pretty cool. It all depends on what you're looking for - but in Vegas, I spend very little time in the hotel room, so the nicer rooms don't really matter to me.

As far as food, there is pretty good food available in the Golden Nugget. At the pool, you can order sandwiches from the bar, and they're really good (you can also charge the food to your room so you don't have to bring cash with you to the pool). There's a Italian restaurant called Grotto inside, close to the check-in desk and pool. Grotto is really good too, but pricey ($10-$30 plates). If you get the meatballs, be warned - they are about the size of baseballs, so go when you're really hungry! The buffet is OK for breakfast, I've never tried it for dinner though.

They have the coolest pool I've ever seen - there's a shark tank in the middle of it, and a water slide that goes through the middle! Cabanas are available too, but you'll want to reserve one in advance.

Personally, I think the slot machines in downtown Vegas pay better than the ones on the strip. I always seem to do much better on Fremont Street. Last time I was at the Nugget, I won $900 on one machine and $600 on another, in the same day!",1,0,0

We stayed in the Carson Tower, which I believe is the oldest of the three followed by the Gold Tower and the Rush Tower, which is the new and very up to date tower.

Check in was easy and we always used the valet for parking.  Tip: Call down from your room to request your car, then it will be waiting for you when you get downstairs instead of you waiting for it.

THE ROOM:  The Carson Tower room was perfect for what we were after, basically a clean, quiet place to crash after a hard day or night on the town.  Bathrooms were average sized with granite counters and a nice selection of toiletries.  The room itself wasn't exactly dated, but it is definitely not as sleek and modern as the newer rooms on the Strip or the Rush Tower rooms.  But let's face it, you're staying downtown for a reason, and that reason is that you can spend 4 nights downtown for less than 1 night on the Strip!

THE POOL: Very nice!  Has a fast water slide that runs through a huge shark tank, and has a nice shallow area with special lounge chairs for sitting in the water.  There is cocktail service and a walk-up bar at the pool, as well as 4-5 blackjack tables that are staffed throughout the day.  Take the stairs or elevator up to the Hideout Pool and spend $10-$20 for the day to have a more private, quiet experience.

The Nugget has a lot more bars and restaurants located throughout since my last stay there in 1997.  We had lunch at the Grotto near the pool one day during their happy hour and the pizza was pretty good; for $6 you got a 12"" thin crust pie.

Overall, the Golden Nugget is a Strip hotel located Downtown.  It is by far the best of the Downtown hotels, and would probably get into the top 15% of Strip hotels for amenities and service, but the best part is that it's about 75% cheaper than any of those Strip hotels.

So if you're looking for a very nice, clean, friendly place to stay in Vegas, and don't mind the extra 5 minute drive to Downtown, stay at the Nugg and use your savings to gamble or splurge!  

I highly recommend the Golden Nugget.",6,0,0

I miss the smaller, more intimate days of yore, but if we're stuck with the music festival then I'm glad it's all based around the Nugget. Everything was clean and the staff was very nice whenever I dealt with them. When we stayed at Sunset Station a few years ago for PRB we were getting the stink-eye all weekend from security and staff. This place is a serious labyrinth, though! I was still getting lost on my 5th day there. Our rooms were huge but the double beds seemed smaller than we were used to.

One morning we sat for video poker and the bartender did not greet us, made a drink right in front of us, and walked away right as I said ""excuse me"" to order a drink. Bartender there the second day, sat playing for about 15 mins without a drink. Finally asked for one and I swear he seemed like I was troubling him. Third, we ordered room service the first afternoon we got there. They quoted 35-45 mins for delivery. 1 1\/2 hours go by and my bf finally  called to check on the order and they tell us it was delivered to another room and they will make another one right now.

From what I saw of the hotels around Fremont Street however, it is probably the best. We stayed in the Carson tower which is the older part apparently. It was okay but certainly not approaching upscale. I put it on par with a typical three-star hotel. Everything about the room was...just okay. The weekend price was pretty ridiculous but considering the time and place, I begrudgingly admit it was fairly priced. The coupons they gave us with the promotion we used, were basically useless: Two for one buffet...on a weekday, did not help us at all. Ten percent off retail purchase of one hundred dollars or more-useless, ten dollars off spa service of sixty dollars or more-useless, buy one get one free cocktail-useless, especially in a casino. If you are considering staying here, do NOT count the inclusion of their coupons. Oh, if you like coffee, bring K cups, they charge ten bucks for four here. Also, buy some bottled water before you arrive. They charge an arm and a leg for water here and the tap water sucks.

The pool is amazing. You can view it and the shark tank as they are basically one, from the lobby area. It really looks like a fun place to party. They have poolside blackjack with some fine looking women as dealers which is cool although the rules are not conducive to winning.

The food here is pretty good. We ate at Lillie's Asian, Claim jumper, and Caddilac Mexican Kitchen, all were very good.

The main selling point of this hotel is the area. It's an awesome location if you are looking for the Fremont street experience-just walk out of the casino and you're there! If you come to party, this the place. If you are looking for peace, go elsewhere.",1,0,0

Each time we stay at the Golden Nugget.  So when the time came to plan our wedding, we immediately knew our location.  

We contacted Silke in Sales and she provided us all the information we needed to choose the perfect wedding package.  They truly do have a package for all budgets!  Silke was with us all the way helping to handle many of the details including the ceremony, food, drink, favors, rooms for our out-of-town guests, amenities and many other items.   

The wedding chapel is small but elegant and overlooks the gorgeous pool!  The banquet rooms are all fully equipped and tastefully designed.  The reception buffet was excellent!  All of our guests raved about it and though we were very busy, we did get to taste it and agreed wholeheartedly.  Since our group was relatively small (less than 40), we had a small wait staff.  Still they were impeccable in providing service throughout the entire reception and it was a relief for me to be able to enjoy the time with my new husband, family and friends rather than having to direct things every minute. 

 If I had to cite one negative aspect it would be that outside photographer and videographers are not allowed to shoot the actual ceremony.  The Golden Nugget does provide these services and they are adequate but we really wanted our own photographer to shoot the entire experience. 

 All in all, our wedding was as magical and beautiful as we'd imagined and the Golden Nugget gets a lot of credit for that!

OUR SPA EXPERIENCE:  During our wedding\/honeymoon  Initially, I visited the spa to have my hair and makeup done for the wedding.  Both the hair stylist and makeup artists were masters of their craft!  Please view the attached pictures to see their wonderful work!  

I brought in pictures of three possible up-dos (created during a trial run with my hometown hairdresser) and The Spa stylist ended up creating a combination between the three!  She used all my own hair to create a full and elegant up-do!  

As for makeup, I had no idea what I wanted and put myself in her capable hands.  I shared with her that my usual makeup is minimal: Bare Minerals and mascara.  Since this was a special occasion, she suggested a more dramatic eye and minimal cheek and lips.  Everyone agreed that the result was simply stunning!

Our second encounter was during an in-room couples' massage (included in the wedding package we purchased).   The therapists were very professional and attentive to our preferences.  They were very skilled and we were both thoroughly relaxed by the end of the hour!  I highly recommend The Spa at the Golden Nugget!",2,0,0

I knew check in was not until 3pm but was informed we may be able to get an early check in if we asked or at least have the hold our bags until we could get in room. Staff was rude! Bell hops were RUDE! No one knew what was going on, we had no idea who to talk to , told us to just ""stand over there"" and then walked right up to the folks behind us and graciously took them to where they needed to be. We waited approx 20 minutes to meet Mr. Wonderful behind the counter who told us each 2 different stories about check in but did offer to text my phone once room was ready (which didn't happen) Once we were finally checked in we were told to wait (no idea where again) just wait until they decided to see what we wanted. Fifteen minutes later, I was getting upset. I literally just opened the bellhop door we eventually found and had to ask them to please help us! He rudely told me ""JUST WAIT"" so about 10 minutes after that they finally thought it was time to do their job. We were told to expect the text so we decided to hang out on Fremont until we heard back from them....never happened. We just decided to go to the strip and see what we could do. Came back to the hotel at 4:30pm and the manager was there in the lobby. We told him about our horrible check in experience and he really didnt give a crap. The guy behind the counter did offer 2 free buffet passes for both rooms, which made us happy and we were grateful. The room was okay, we knew we werent staying the remodeled part of the hotel so we didnt expect much. We did however expect working toilets! Our toilets would back up everytime we flushed, by the third time we just decided to use the ones in the lobby. It was a great time riding down from the 8th floor to have to pee every morning! We still didnt complain to the front, we just dealt with it. Decided to use our free buffet Friday night. Get to the buffet counter...they have no idea we were given vouchers - had to call down and prove it (eye roll) food was okay after all of this, we were just beyond annoyed with this place.

Check Out: 
5 am....someone who actually helped us right away 
Not only did they not get the free buffet right for both rooms but also added an extra person's buffet dinner on our bill at check out & tried to charge us $94! ( IN ADDITION TO RESORT FEE)
They had my credit card on file for the $50 security deposit (that'll fall off in a few days -- still hasnt happened) and they asked if i wanted to put the resort fee on the same card, I told her no and gave her another card. Well they decided to run it on the other one anyways! Now I've paid TWO resort fees (that extra one will fall off according to the front desk chick I FINALLY got ahold of yesterday) 



Two days later and I am still waiting for a manager to call me. 
This place is beyond ridiculous. We go to Vegas every year, twice this year - and with the amount of money I fork over to stay, eat and especially PLAY  at their casino...jeez louise. Common courtesy & respect is expected. Be helpful. Train your people better! SOMETHING. everyone just gives you the run around and passes the problem off to someone else

The only one who knew what he was doing and was respectful was the maint guy who had to unclog our toilet!! I felt bad having to bother him (why we just found it easier to go downstairs) 

I really hope this place can either train the rude folks they have to do a better job or HIRE NEW FOLKS.

Value - 2 stars

The wife and I went to Vegas this past weekend and for something different, we decided to stay in Fremont Street at the Golden Nugget.  We usually stay at the strip, but sometimes come out to Old Vegas to gamble when we want to be cheap, so we figured why not.

We really wanted to love our experience here.  Sadly, we really didn't.  

When we arrived, we dragged our luggage from the parking lot (Parking was free because we were hotel guests) to the check in area, and waited for about 15 minutes in line.  While I didn't mind that much about the wait, the line was consistently long every time we walked by the area (to go gambling, walking by, etc).  Line was always full of guests waiting to be checked in.

While checking in, I informed the clerk that we were celebrating an anniversary.  He mentioned that they would note that in the registration... but nothing ever came of it.  We did get a coupon book though (oh wait, everyone got a coupon book).

I guess we could have used more of the coupon book... but a bunch of them were for discounted drinks (or two-for-one offers) at the clubs.  Since we got drinks for the cost of tips while gambling, we skipped out on those.  Other coupons were for two-for-one breakfasts or lunches at the Cafe, which was one of the high points of the stay.

The room itself was quaint.  We stayed at the South Tower since the North Tower was ""completely sold out.""  The TV was tiny one that equated to our spare one at home that we don't even use.  The bathroom was unspectacular, and the bed was fairly comfortable (another high point of the stay).

We got thirsty\/hungry at one point in the trip on the first day, and went down the hallway to get a drink and some munchies from the vending machine.  Bad idea.  The 20 oz Diet Coke ($2.50 for a 20oz Diet Coke) that was dispensed was 5 months expired (expired 8\/20\/08) -- mind you, we went this past weekend (1\/2009) -- and the Twix bars tasted like they were melted and cooled repeatedly.

So I contact the Front Desk and let them know, and the person I speak to is (understandably) horrified.  They ask me to bring the product downstairs to the Front Desk in order to get it taken care of.  I trek down from the room (ass end of nowhere) to the Front Desk, where there's still a line of people waiting to check in, and after about 10 minutes of procedure, signatures, me showing proof that I was in fact a guest, they hand me back my $2.50.  

No apologies, no comp'ing me for my troubles, just the $2.50 back and a ""Oh I'm sure the drinks in the Gift Shop aren't expired.""  Don't want to get ripped off?  Bring your own sodas\/snacks (from Walgreens down the Fremont Street or somewhere else) and use their ice makers in the hallways.  At least (hopefully) that ice hasn't expired.  

Later on we used a two-for-one breakfast\/lunch coupon at the Buffet, which read ""Usable on Monday-Friday"" but since the Buffet was closed, it was usable at the Carson Street Cafe... on Saturday.  It was pretty busy there, so the food was only decent.  We actually had a better food experience off-site, across the street for $1 Nathan's hot dogs at Mermaids.  The Starbucks inside Golden Nugget is also about $2 higher than your normal Starbucks for no reason except it's occupying hotel space.

""Good morning Mrs. Hilmers! Is there something we can do for you?""
""...yes....the room next to us....their kids have been screaming since 6:45am....is there anything you can do?""
""We could send security up to check on them.""
""..oh...I don't think it's a security issue, I think they are just horrible children.""

The hotel went to great lengths to make sure the rest of our stay here was pleasant and comp'd us a meal. The room we were moved to had a great view of the strip which I was more than happy to be nowhere near. 

So yes, I think I've found my hotel!

Also, the shark tank is pretty awesome. The slide..well..don't think you'll see fish when you go down the slide. It's more like blurs of silver, but the slide is still great. I think the pool is half kid urine, but somehow the tank kept me distracted from that. :D",0,1,0

Of all of the older casinos along Fremont, the Golden Nugget has renewed itself with a significant makeover earlier this year, making it one of the top casinos (if not THE top casino) in the downtown area.

The casino seems slightly more expanded, with more slot machines in various areas than before.  They've also increased some of the table games load and there seems to be a good mix of games \/ limits for high and low rollers alike.  Comps here are far easier to achieve than any strip casino, though most players should know this.  Overall the casino staff has been accommodating, though I think the cocktail waitresses are looking a little old to be skimping around for tips.

The rooms in the North and South tower are unbelievably nice, especially after the recent renovation.  Anyone who has stayed here in the last two decades will recognize the key changes made in all rooms from suites to standard deluxes.  One end has incorporated a modern, contemporary theme and the other still retains the old luxurious theme, reminiscent of a mini-Bellagio but with a much cheaper price tag.

Though the general demographic here is most certainly going to be older, Gold Diggers is the only nightlife venue to attract a younger crowd.  At least the dining choices feature a good amount of variety, with the Buffet and Vic & Anthony's earning my biggest nods.

If I had to stay anywhere downtown, the Golden Nugget would be my first choice.  It's recent changes and new additions are good enough reasons to make this casino one of the better choices downtown.",4,1,2

I was surprised at how clean the Golden Nugget was, and how nice it was! Honestly, I was expecting a lot less. It wasn't until we visited some of the supposedly ""nicer"" places on the strip that we realized that the Nugget is much better than it's given credit for. 

Our room was very clean. The carpet had just been cleaned before we arrived. I guess it's possible that a lake of vomit had to be cleaned up, or the soggy remnants of a porn video production, or whatever, but the only thing we saw or smelled was a clean room. I appreciated that. Then we noticed that somebody was always, and I mean ALWAYS, doing a shampoo job on the carpet somewhere in that place. Whatever the reason, I liked it. It told me that they wanted it to be clean all the time. 

We never attempted room service. In fact, we didn't take advantage of much at all that the hotel had to offer. If it had have been only the room I was talking about, I would have given it 5 stars, especially after seeing the room my friends had in a much more expensive hotel on the strip!

This trip was to pick up my in-laws as they were visiting friends in town. Looking around, I found a great package deal from Orbitz that included 3 nights stay for two rooms and an SUV from Hertz. All for $500. 

Valet parking was quick and efficient. The front doors aren't automated, so you have to manually hold the door open if you have a lot of stuff to lug around. Checked in to the hotel, and the front desk girl was fine. Really no chit chat, just all business. Not super friendly like most of the strip hotels, but not rude either. Almost impersonal. We were given two adjoining rooms with double beds in the Carson Tower. This is where it got crazy. I know Vegas hotels are huge, but didn't expect it in downtown. Our rooms were literally the furthest you can get from the casino floors. But I guess for the price I paid, I expected a not so great room. But that was a trek to the room! Seriously, why aren't there two separate banks of elevators. I counted...after the elevator ride, i turned a corner 5 times!

Rooms were clean, but too much open space. I feel like there should be more furniture or something. Clean beds, clean bath, flat TV, really nothing more you can ask for except maybe a mini fridge.

Casino floors were very busy, and very smoky. Typical of downtown hotels due to their low ceilings. Lost money here. Construction around and outside hotel, so beware of that. Also, they charge for non-guests to park on property, which is a bit odd. Also there are 2 starbucks on site, but hit up the Dunkin Donuts at Fremont for better coffee. You can get Starbux anywhere.

The hotel itself was nice. The Rush Tower room was decent for the price. It's right on Fremont St, so you can enjoy the overhead show at night. The pool is nice, but it was super crowded in the summer as it's quite smaller than many of the Strip hotels.

However, outside the walls of the Golden Nugget is a different story. I would not eat at any of the downtown restaurants outside of the Golden Nugget (except for the legendary Binion's Steakhouse). But by contrast, I would gamble anywhere downtown except at the Golden Nugget, where their $10+ minimum tables made me shake my head. If I wanted to play tables of this price, I'd go to the Strip. Very disappointing. However, there were plenty of nearby places like Binion's, Fitz, etc., that were the cheap gaming experience I expected.  

If you want to stay downtown, Golden Nugget is the best and (in my opinion) the only option. However, there is no reason to stay Downtown. Get a room on the Strip or stay at one of the quality off Strip hotels if you want a cheaper option. If you want to see Downtown, travel here for a couple hours, which is all you will need before you will want to leave.

Great service they greet you & make you feel as if they are your friend at the front desk when we checked in. 

RUSH TOWER seems to be their newest renovated tower & literally smelt nothing like cigarettes CRAZY! Anyways the moment you walk in you see they HUGE FISH TANK behind the front desk where you check in. The chandeliers above our heads were gorgeous and sparkly.

We went to the VIP line check in & our girl helped us quickly & efficiently... KALEI was also one of the staff members that helped us pick out our room when I tried to compare prices with third party sites he made me notice that is it much more beneficial to actually go to the mother site. THANK YOU KALEI for having that pointed out to me. Really looking out for their guests is a number one plus in my view 

We got to our room door & the keys did not work... so went back down she double checked them & they still didn't work. So we used the hall way phone as she instructed so that we don't have to come all the way back down... security came up the help us... he taught us that we need to push it all the way back & make sure the arrows on the card are staight. 

Ahahhaha I guess you get what you pay for... but we walked in you see double door opening bathroom area with beautiful marble & huge sink w\/ waterfall shower top. A vanity across from the bathroom right when you turn left into the room.

There was a couch area with a TV & then the lovely king bed right behind the couch with also a TV to watch as well. It was a corner suite so we had two window views which was one of the strip & the other not so sightly of the plaza hotel & pool hahaha

There was a table to do business on and everything in this room was just homey...only thing I did wish was to have a better comforter blanket... it was very flat & not so fluffy as you would expect from a hotel.. but the pillows were fluffy as heaven!",6,4,7

Nice double view as we were in a corner room.  Fantastic view of the mountain range.  Great view of the pool area from directly above it.  

PROS: The room was very nice upon arrival.  Clean and everything in place.  The front desk personnel were courteous and helpful with lots of smiles.
- HOUSEKEEPING: Even housekeeping personnel all through the hotel would answer any question we had with a smile and ""good luck!""  If you call the housekeeping desk, they do make sure your request is taken care of quickly.
- The Gordie Brown show.  Don't miss this one.  Seriously.  Try to get the dinner and a show coupons - ask the ticket counter or front desk and YES, THEY OFFER A MILITARY DISCOUNT.  
- The SPA: Well worth the $$ for a therapeutic massage by Jeff (get that trip for you and your dad back to the Old County going. Post pics of the Pirminator).   And so totally worth the $$ for the mani\/pedi from Karol.  Just an excellent service provided by both.  The staff was not only friendly but super super helpful, even an hour before they closed.  
- THE POOL: Yep, beautiful.  Towels are free as is entrance if you're a guest.  The lifeguards could smile more but still helpful :)
- SHARK TANK - everything you see on YouTube is the way it is.  Super cool to look at and slide through.  Beautiful photo ops. 
- VALET - free and very nice people.  Be sure to tip them.  They deserve it.
- INTERIOR - so nice and elegantly decorated.  The chandeliers are well worth a few pictures.
- BARTENDERS - super nice and make a great gin\/tonic (especially the ones at the Gordie Brown show area).  
- THE ROOM - if anything is not working, report it immediately to the front desk (always good to do a function check at the beginning of your stay).  They are really good about taking care of room issues right away.

CONS: No real explanation of their rewards\/VIP program.  SUGGESTION: Offer your guests a mini-seminar (say, 20 minutes or so) in a conference room to answer questions and go over all the services you provide in your rewards program.  The lobby is super busy and super noisy so this would not be a good venue but it would give a special touch of class to your hotel.  Guests should sign up as soon as they get there or a month or two prior to your trip to get your card.   
- AMENITIES: Why do you charge $10 for a 4-pack of K-cups?  SUGGESTION FOR GUESTS: Leave GN k-cups right where they are.  Go to Walgreen's on Freemont and get a 12-pack for about the same price.  Get snacks and drinks while you're there for those late-nite munchie attacks.  Well worth the effort.  NO MINI FRIDGE - unsure if you can ask for one but if you're going to stay a week, they should at least offer to bring one up for you.
- The SPA:  No military discount.  
- HOUSEKEEPING: You will be making a lot of calls to housekeeping. No daily 2 bottles of water as promised on their brochure. Once or twice the cleaning didn't provide shampoo, another roll of TP, no extra tissues, they took one of the robes (make sure you tell the front desk so they don't charge you $60 for a missing robe) or the small things that make staying here special.   
- THE POOL - upper decks are not free.  
- SHUTTLE SERVICE - not free - why do I mention this?  Because each call to the front desk advises their airport shuttle is free.  We never saw a shuttle that specifically said Golden Nugget on it so if it is free, you need to tell us where to look for the GN shuttle.  Otherwise, 1-way to\/from the airport is $9 per person.
- THE SOUND SYSTEM: Dear God in Heaven, please upgrade your sound system so that even at the higher levels, it sounds smooth.  The sound is extremely blaring and obnoxious not only in the pool area but especially in the lounge\/bar and GoldDiggers club.  
- INTERIOR - please change your carpet to something lighter so your casino\/lobby\/common areas don't look dark\/depressing.  For an elegantly decorated hotel, the carpet is the absolute worst.",1,0,0

We couldn't get in anywhere on the strip for our first night, so we thought to give downtown a try for the first time ever.  Boy am I glad we did!  We LOVED the Golden Nugget!  

First off, the valet service was nice, especially since it was free.  Check in was easy and we were able to get a room on a high floor not near elevators\/ice machines, which was a plus.  The only negative was that we weren't in the newer (Rush) tower and came to find out it wasn't much more to stay over there... I wish someone had offered it to us.  Nonetheless, our room was really nice and clean, the bed was comfortable, and it was a good size.

We LOVED the pool area.  Though it was a bit chilly to swim, it was nice to sit outside, listen to music, have a drink, and be near the fire pit.  I do wish they had more more pits though, because it was usually packed and didn't allow for more people to partake in it's glory.  

Even though we only stayed one night, we really enjoyed the atmosphere of the Golden Nugget.

Plus- The hotel did end up upgrading us both (2 separate rooms) and then we went on our way in better rooms. 
Had myself a winning streak on the slot machines on my stay so definitely loved the casino.

Restaurants all great. Hit up the happy hours at Cadillac and grotto pizza place. Food great in both places and drinks as well.

This hotel as recommended to me by some very trusted sources before a recent trip to Vegas. Now I'm no Vegas expert--I've actually only been one other time, and it was just for one night with my mother. I'm not sayin' my mom's not a party animal, but I think it's safe to assume that we made it to sleep earlier than most Vegas-goers do. I was pretty excited for this take-two Vegas adventure and I think the Golden Nugget was a perfect home base on this trip. 

The hotel is located at the end of the ""Fremont Street Experience,"" which is certainly an experience. So many performers, chippendales, little booths to buy chachkies, bars, etc. It was sort of stimulation overload for me, but a very fun little jaunt. The hotel itself is pretty modern for being such a classic. Again, I don't have much to compare it to in terms of casino quality, but it looked pretty good to me. I sort of hate that you can smoke cigarettes in these places, but I get why it's part of the experience for a lot of people. 

The check in line is sort of a hot mess. I think this might be the case in most Vegas hotels around 3 pm, but it still doesn't make it fun. The line moves excruciatingly slowly, everyone has luggage, and it seems like people might start their Vegas activities as soon as they land in Nevada (or maybe before), because there were definitely some happy\/tipsy people in line. When we finally made it through the line to check in, the front desk clerk was super nice but also told us a slightly bizarre story about how he was born on the day his girlfriend's aunt died. I'll chalk it up to small talk and did definitely note that the hospitality industry is on top of their game in LV.

Our room was located in the Rush Tower and we were on the 21st floor, so we were able to see past the parking garage and onto the city. The rooms are spacious and clean, the beds are comfy, and those black out curtains are somethin' else. I honestly could've slept in all morning if it weren't for my excitement to check out the shark tank slide! The wifi was sort of a bust for me--it's supposed to be included in your $30 resort fee, but when we tried to log on it gave us a $15 and $25 option. We called down and they reset it, but once I was logged on I hardly got any internet at all. Not a huge deal, but I did have a little work to do and was glad I had my own hot spot.

Let's talk about the star of the show here: the shark tank! This was actually super cool and I can see why people love it. My friend and I made our way down to the pool around 10 am and it was already blazing hot. The pool temp is chilly, but perfect for those 115+ days. We made a few laps in the pool to check out the sharks and fish and made sure to take a few runs down the water slide. We were having so much fun that we asked for late check out, which the front desk happily approved. This hotel was definitely the fun, slightly cheesy old school Vegas vibe I was looking for.

The Golden Nugget is probably the nicest casino in downtown Las Vegas. I'd rank it above Imperial Palace, Harrahs, etc but not quite T.I. or the Mirage.

Came in here after driving from Huntington Beach straight to Vegas 6 hours of HELL and on an empty stomach. We headed to the cafe here because honestly, the casino here is cleaner than all the other ones around it downtown. Also the food seemed normal compared to the 99 cent foot long hot dogs and deep fried Snickers at the nearby casinos.

We all demolished our breakfast food and hit the tables for some action. The casino staff was very friendly and the limits are on the upper end of of downtown limits. (10 dollar BJ, $5 craps, etc).

The first problem is that the bathroom\/toilet in our room was not working. We had to call maintenance to come fix it. That should have been fixed before we checked in. The second problem was that we wanted to valet our car as we were staying at the hotel and were clearly told, in a very demeaning tone, by the 'valet guy', that valet is full even for hotel guests and there is nothing that they can do. 
The good: the beds were comfortable and the shark tank is pretty cool. The restaurant pictures where they claim that you could eat right by The shark tank are not all that accurate. You are close but far from right by it.
Since we went to stay there on the weekend where a festival was going on downtown, it was pricey. I was able to get it at a better price through the festival website, which I believe is the price the hotel usually charges. That was a good thing.
The restaurants are just OK. We went to RED sushi and were sorely disappointed. The buffet is apparently OK but we were not willing to wait in line for one hour and they have a claim Jumper as well as Asian cuisine. The food is just average.
This hotel has potential, but being downtown, despite renovation, it's still maintains the infrastructure from many years ago.

The standard room on the 16th featured a king size bed, a sectional couch, large flat screen TV, DVD player, and best of all a to built into the mirror in the bathroom that is visible from the spa style tub. 

They had every game that the other casinos had. Although I would have liked to see some $5 blackjack tables here during the weekdays (especially since all of the surrounding casinos had that). But overall you can't really find something they don't have. 

There were plenty of dining options as well and of course bars throughout. I have to give a shout out to the best bartender ever, Ku. She was unlike any bartender I have ever met in Vegas, GENUINE! She's a total gem and makes guests feel VIP no matter the circumstances.

My driver dropped me off at the hotel in the back and when I say driver I received a ride alone in a short bus from the airport. I was staying in the Carson tower and when I walked in I was informed to go to the Carson tower registration. 

So I started walking through the craziness of a Vegas Casino. Maneuvering around tired people who are drinking a lot and losing too much money. They are like rats trapped in a box for 4 days and 3 nights and are in no hurry to go anywhere. But I pushed on and made my way past the mayhem while dragging my suitcase to get to the Carson tower for check in.

When I arrived at the Carson registration desk there was a sign that said Desk closed. Check in at the Rush Tower. What? So now I had to go back through the mayhem again. I pushed through and when I got to the Rush Tower there was a sign that informed me to check in at the Gold Tower registration because the desk was closed. What?

At this point I felt like there were hidden cameras laughing at my every move. I took a deep breath and decided to look for the Gold Tower registration. I asked the lady running the high roller Keno room and she pointed me to the VIP check in door. I knew this wasn't correct but I was frustrated and I was going to make it work. 

So I walked in with my frustrated face and informed the staff of my wild goose chase I had just been on. I also dropped the Keno ladies name because it's always good to drop a name. I believe they took a little pity on me but the staff was very unapologetic to my dilemma. They were also very unfriendly and it was probably because I wasn't a high roller VIP. I did ask them if it's normal to send guests on a scavenger hunt to check in and they looked at me like it wasn't a big deal. I then asked if they were going to fix the incorrect signs and they told me no. After 10 hours of no sleep and traveling I had no more fight in me but I do know this was wrong. 

Upon walking to my room I finally walked past the open registration desk for the Gold Tower. I will say this was a frustrating way to arrive at a hotel. 

So I get into my room and start unpacking my bag. I then go to the bathroom to wash my face and realized someone had used the bathroom. Yes someone sat on the toilet seat, used the toilet paper, unwrapped the soap and used a clean towel. I'm too exhausted for this. I called down and spoke with the front desk. I also asked if I could be moved to a new room. Of course my request was denied and a maid was sent up to clean my room. A housekeeping manager walked in and told the maid to clean my whole room including the sheets. She was actually nice and hard working. So I left my room for an hour to let the maid do her job. 

Day 2...I wake up early and leave to get my work day started. When I arrived back 4 hours later my room wasn't clean. I spoke with the maid in the hall and she said they would clean my room by 1pm. She even wrote me on her list. I came back to the room at 2pm and it wasn't clean. I called Housekeeping and they said they would send someone up. I got back to my room at 5pm and it was still dirty. I called and spoke with a manager who promised to take care of it and my room was finally cleaned at 6pm. Honestly is it that hard?

Day 3...It was my only day to sleep in and the maid bangs 5 times with the vacuum cleaner even though I had a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on my door! Was it necessary to ram my door that many times? It was just rude. She knew what she was doing. 

Day 4...The room was prepaid by my client but for some reason the hotel decided to charge my credit card. I called down to the front desk and they were no help. The girl on the phone was rude and unhelpful. Then when I went downstairs that same girl was there. She was mean to me because of our phone call. I asked her to only see a copy of my bill. She printed me a bill with my credit card charged. She then slid open a drawer where she had her personal cell phone and started texting. This was incredibly rude & why would you do this in front of an upset customer. I did snap a photo of her displaying this unacceptable behavior. I really believe the staff needs to go through a hospitality travel course because they don't get it. 

The hotel staff doesn't have any good customer service. The employees seem unhappy and it translates into the bad customer service I received. In all of my travels, I've never seen a more incompetent  staff, then here. 

On another note: the room was nice. I was expecting dirty old gross Vegas but that is not what I received. The casino was very modern. The pool had a shark tank in the middle which was really cool. You could even water slide through the middle of the sharks. This place wasn't what I expected. It's just sad that the customer service isn't there. I score hard on being treated nice and the Golden Nugget failed on every level.",71,33,15

(If I hadn't have asked I would not have been issued a VIP card nor informed about the free drinks and snacks that I am entitled to during my stay...thanks Danielle!) I later went downstairs to ask the Front Desk about the public transportation bus to get to the strip and another female working on Thursday around 12 noon in the VIP Lounge said she has no idea of what bus to take there....ARE YOU KIDDING ME!??!!? This must be a question that people ask on a regular basis so the fact that she knew NOTHING about the ""Deuce Bus"" was absolutely ridiculous!

First, I just love downtown. It has a great 'feel' to it. It's friendly and easy to have fun affordably or luxuriously.

Second, The Golden Nugget is like Peter A. says: ""The Crown Jewel of Downtown"" and is also much nice than many mega hotels on the Strip. 

Third, the Rush Tower is absolutely the best room I've had, ranking above Caesar's. It's clean, smoke free since it was built, has excellent design and bedding, a private check in desk, and is only $20 to upgrade from their Carson Tower room. HIGHLY Recoomend the Rush Tower.

Fourth, their pool is the bomb! Huge Shark tank with a water slide that goes through it. Lounge chairs in the shallow water, outside gambling tables (yes there are some $5 minimum tables too), a fire pit, and nice size hot tub for the evening, it's perfect, albiet maybe not big enough for the amount of people dying to use it. 

Fifth, surprisingly delcious dining options, especially love the Grotto restaurant for amazing Italian fare at reasonable prices. (See my review on that) AND their Cafe is pretty darn good. The service is a tad slow there though.

Stayed here just one night before staying 3 nights on the Strip at Ballys (12\/20 to 12\/24).  The hubs and I have been going to Vegas probably about 3 times a year for the past 5 years, but this was my first time staying at the Nugget.  The room was nice, but it's really the bed that gets the 4 stars --- I had no idea how seriously posh it was until we moved to Ballys, and the hubs jumped on the bed, belly-flop style, fully expecting the nice cushion like at Golden Nugget.  Ballys, not so much cushion, more like painful pool-belly-flop.  We got a pretty good deal for our stay, so for sure I'd repeat, especially if it were the summer and we could take advantage of the pool.

SPA: Awesome. I've hit 4 other spas in Vegas (at Caesars, Venetian, New Orleans, and Treasure Island), and I loved this one.  The hubs surprised me with an early morning treatment, a prenatal scrub, which had me a little worried as to whether I'd really find it relaxing.  The facilities are pretty nice - you walk into a small-ish lobby to check in, straight off one set of elevators, then you enter one door into a larger area with upholstered chairs, coffee, and fancy water dispensers.  Then you enter through another door into a hallway, which branches off into a few curtained off areas -- part of leads to the steam + dry saunas (can't tell you about these since I couldn't use them) and also an upper level hot tub that looked fantastic -- dual staircase leading to this well-lit but soft lighting, with murals that look like curtains.  Sure, it could look more posh if they had actual draperies, but it's practical to have the paint rather than drapes in the steamy area.  The showers + vanity area is pretty large, the lockers a bit smaller but enough room for 2 chaises and 2 upholstered chairs, and a separate changing room (literally, a room outfitted so you can change in privacy).

More importantly, my smoothie body treatment was fan.tastic.  Started at the legs + feet -- my skin is a little sensitive, so the scrub was a little more scrub-tastic than I'd have liked.  But holy cow, Linda was my therapist, and her work on my shoulders and back (by working on me as I lay on my back, and later on my side) was pure magic.  Again, I'm super sensitive, and sometimes shoulder and back massages can get painful, esp because of how much tension I'm always carrying -- but she did a great job, easily the best I've ever received, and I didn't even mention my sensitivity to her.  Although I'm sure if I had, she would have been immediately responsive, she was great.  Not too much chatter, just every now and then, which was great -- I'm not a huge talker, but I get that complete silence is sometimes weird.  I wish Linda could move to Austin.",1,0,1

If you have ever stayed on the Strip, The Golden Nugget pales in comparison on every level! It's definitely a different level of standards here, and I was not expecting them to be so far below what we're used to from hotels like MGM Grand, Planet Hollywood, etc...
 
- Service was terrible: Check-in took 10x longer than usual and staff was not knowledgeable or courteous about anything in the hotel or in the area. I've experienced better service at a holiday inn!

- Hotel Pool: sure the shark slide is cool. Very cool, it's the hotels only saving grace.  So you would thing it would makes sense for them to invest in more than a small area of lounge chairs. By noon, every single pool chair was filled, even the ones in the shade (which accounted for over 1\/2 the deck). This is a very family friendly pool, so having one area for the huge families and other people wanting to lay out and relax was a turn off. 

- Rooms: I am usually not a room snob, and I'm usually really happy with every room I've stayed at in Vegas. The rooms at the G.N were not even close to those standards.  No fridge, no complimentary coffee, no wi-fi.... not good.  It really felt like a depressing holiday inn. We were staying in the Gold Tower. Rush tower seemed nicer. Won't be back to find out.

-Hotel Offerings: Husband and I both felt sick after eating at the buffet. Instantly ill, the both of us. It knocked us out for the rest of the night. We had trouble finding a quick place to grab a bite as their offerings were either steak house or starbucks. 

- Gambling: with low ceilings and no ventilation, I felt like i was in a smoke box the entire time i was on the floor.

This trip was to celebrate my Mother in laws birthday. I called the hotel directly almost two months in advance. We needed to make sure we got a handicap accessible room preferably with a roll in shower, as my Mom can't stand to get get out of her chair, and has to transfer over to do anything outside of her chair. 

We were informed that they only had FOUR handicap accessible rooms with a roll in shower but they all had king beds. (Do they not take into consideration that some disabled people would like to not have to share a bed with their traveling companions?) They said we could have a roll away cot brought in for the third person. As it was my Mom, my husband and myself we needed 2 beds. Making someone sleep on a ROLL AWAY COT for FOUR days of a VACATION was unacceptable to me for the amount of money we were paying for the room. So we compromised and booked a room they said was also handicap accessible, that had two double beds but a regular bathtub that we could use a shower chair in.  I thought that would be ok as long as it was truly accessible, so we booked the room.

Upon arrival, we waited in line for about 20 minutes while we waited for one of only 2 clerks working the check in. There were about 18 people behind us and about 5 people in front of us when we got there. After getting to the check in desk, we were informed that there were NO handicap rooms with double beds available at all (even though we booked this room two months prior.) The desk clerk finally got her supervisor and he found a room that was handicap accessible with two double beds. So up to our room we went.

Although our room did have two double beds thats about all I can say about it. First, the beds were too high. I mean they were even high for able bodied people. When you can't use your legs, the only ways to get into bed are to transfer evenly from your chair to the bed. This can only be accomplished if the bed is even or just slightly (1 or 2 inches) above or below the seat on the chair. They other was is kind of degrading. You either have to have someone pick you up and put you in the bed (which wouldn't have happened in this instance), or have someone push you by your behind while your are yanking on the sheets hoping that the housekeeper tucked them in nice and tight, while you pull yourself over the bed. We ended up taking the bed and box spring off the frame and putting the bed and box spring on the floor.

The toilet was low....I mean knees-up-around-my-ears-when-I-sat-down-on-it low. So we called to ask if they had a riser for the loo. What they brought didn't really work. It had plastic bolts on the side so that it would tighten down. Well it didn't. The first time she tried to transfer over, the riser slid nearly off the toliet. So for the whole trip, any time she had to go ( that we were in our room) , I had to hold onto the damn handles attached to the seat. Not to mention the not-helpful-at-all-to-someone-who-can't-use-their-legs grab bar that is bolted to the floor. There was also no room for her to turn around in her wheelchair for the bathroom. She doesn't even have a big chair. Its a little racing chair.

How they thought this room is handicap accessible shows a shocking lack of knowledge in the ADA laws and requirements not to mention a serious lack of training for the front line staff. With more and more customers requiring special needs accommodations it would benefit the Golden Nugget greatly to do a little research and fix the problems with the rooms so that their less spry customers can enjoy their stay as much as their able bodied friends.  

The only reason this review got two stars instead on only on is the service in the poker room. They were very friendly and accommodating when my Mom wanted to play in a no limit poker tourney. 

Unfortunately, the nice guys in the poker room were not enough. We will no longer be staying at the Golden Nugget and will NOT recommend them to anyone.",0,0,0

so off to vegas i go for 7 nights and about $3,000 cash to try and have fun with. so i land in vegas, grab my rental and head to the hotel. turns out there is NO parking left at the hotel, or anywhere nearby for that matter. it wasn't a holiday, just a friday. anyhow, i'm forced to pay $12 a day to park about a block and a half from the hotel (which golden nugget would only cover if i had a receipt). anyhow, after walking through half of fremont street, i finally get to check in. i get my room key and head towards the elevators... should i mention that the check-in and elevators is probably a good 3 minute walk from each other? once out of the elevator i'm making the trek towards my room, another longgggg walk from the elevator. so i get in my room, begin to unpack my things and about 10 minutes later my phone rings. time for a new paragraph.... -=D

it's the front desk! i'm being informed that the room i'm in is actually reserved for another guest. apparently, the couple in the room next to mine wanted to reserve the room i was in for their friends to stay in. and the hotel obliged, even though i had begun to unpack. the front desk apologized and said they would take care of it. so i'm greeted at my door by the lady from the front desk with two $10 comps to their buffet (wow :sarcasm:) and another room key. another 10 minutes of walking later i finally get to my room. thankfully, they let me stay in there this time. i didn't get an upgraded room or anything, same deal.

i told them i wasn't satisfied with the comps and they would have to do more than those buffet discounts to make me happy. i basically got the run around the entire week about who i should be voicing my concerns to.... finally when i did talk to the manager of guest relations, she assured me that those stupid buffet discounts was all they could possibly do.

on to the rest of my experience. like i said i took $3,000 with me to have some fun. so i make another mistake by joining up for their club and during the week blowing the entire thing in their casino.  a big mistake. because after spending an entire week there and blowing $3K, i would up with $30 cash back and no other kinds of comps AT ALL.... i don't know how in the world that is possilble. maybe the card readers at some machines were broke? maybe the points system is really that bad? i didn't even bother asking at that point. it didn't matter. this casino really sucks.

i've never been to ANY PLACE in this world so unforgiving and careless of it's customers. i have been all over the US and parts of canada and yeah, this was absolutely my worst experience ever. i even sort of campaigned for myself for a while after through e-mails with customer service reps at the golden nugget telling them about all of this and not a single person there cared.

bottom line. this place sucks. vegas is definitely one of the least forgiving places to go, but this spot takes the cake. i would in no way ever recommend that anyone give this place a single cent.",4,1,0

It is very apparent that most of the employees are unhappy with their jobs and with the way management is doing things (or not getting things done correctly). I've asked multiple employees why this is and the majority said that those working in management have changed and\/or been replaced and the way things are run is now more inefficient, unfair, counterproductive, and management doesn't care about the front line employees like they generally used to (until around 2014-2015).

I just got an offer via email that said I had both entry into a $799 slot tournament and 3 nights free stay. The way it reads is extremely deceptive and to be sure it wasn't just me, I let 5 friends of various ages read the email, as well as 3 of their friends. I didn't tell them anything about it, I just asked them to tell me what the offer included, and ALL 8 of them thought it included free entry into a slot tournament and 3 nights free stay. When I called to book this promo I was told I had to PAY $799 entry fee for the tournament to get the ""free"" room rate! Keep in mind that rooms at Golden Nugget are around $60-$100 per night depending on the season so I'd have to be an idiot to pay $799 for 3 nights in a regular room there lol! If it was a huge suite it might be worth it if they looked like the junior suites at Caesars Palace. The lady in Golden Nugget Promo department 800# basically inferred that I was stupid and couldn't read (which is why I polled a bunch of people to prove my point and confirm my claim that the email offer was EXTREMELY DECEPTIVE the way it was written) and she sounded very annoyed the whole time as if she couldn't wait for her crappy job and day to end so she could just go home. I was never angry, rude, mean, or anything other than perfectly civil the whole time so for her to act like that and treat me like that was very rude and uncalled for. Because of the deceptiveness of the email as well as her poor attitude, I then requested to be taken off the email list for future offers and she said she couldn't do that (still in the ""annoyed"" tone of course). I will always give a business a 2nd chance because there are always a few bad employees that can ruin your day, but when it's apparent the vast majority of them are bad that's where I draw the line.

This has been my favorite casino to stay at in Downtown Vegas for many years even though I get more and better room offers and promos from Caesars and Venetian, but I'm going to start staying on the strip from now on because the slightly lower cost of food and easier parking Downtown is just not worth the poor service, attitudes of unhappy employees, and deceptive marketing. Instead of paying $9 for a good Golden Nugget cheeseburger, I'll be spending $12 to get a good Venetian burger but that $3 difference to TOTALLY worth the excellent friendly and helpful service that I've always gotten at Venetian, and I'd actually be happy to pay twice that much just to avoid the bad attitudes and poor service of any casino such as the Golden Nugget from now on. Obviously this is MY opinion based on things I've experienced and I hope your experience is better with Golden Nugget, but when all the 1529 Yelp reviews of Golden Nugget only average 3 out of 5 stars you can safely assume that the experiences I've stated above are a pretty accurate depiction of how your experience will be too.",0,0,0

The Tank...
Yup, that's it, and the best part about the experience is being able to say, ""I took a water slide through a shark tank."" and having the photos to prove it since from inside the slide you can see little other than shades of green and gray in the blue as you speed through the clear portion of the slide. 

The rest: 
1.) No bathrobes in our room
2.) Internet costs $12.99 per device for 24 hours of unlimited use, 4 Keurig cups of coffee costs $10
3.) Told at check in we would get a AAA discount, and upon checkout were told that was completely incorrect
4.) We were supposed to get free admission to Gold Diggers because we were staying at the Golden Nugget as part of an event instead we had to use these coupons given out (they're for no cover or buy one drink get one free) so we didn't get the buy one get one deal and two well rum and cokes cost $20. There are way nicer places on Fremont Street that charge less.
5.) Maybe we're neurotic, but we always leave our ""Privacy Please"" sign on the door whether or not we're in the room or not. So on night 3 of our 3 night stay when we returned to our room and saw the sign missing we were a bit perturbed. When we entered and found the sign hanging on the inside of the door in addition to the lights being on, towels on our bed, and a mini-fridge on a kart we were more than a little furious. We called down to the front desk and received a, ""That shouldn't have happened"" - duh. Then we waited on hold for 20 minutes only to be hung up on. When we called back we received more of an explanation, ""I called housekeeping, I'm waiting to hear back."" And what does this do for us? Beyond annoyed we wheeled the fridge into the hall and quickly switched into warmer clothing to go out for the night. When we left 10 minutes later the fridge was gone. So they can take a fridge in ten minutes, but can't offer an apology ever. At check out we asked what happened and what the hotel intended to do about it, and we received the response, ""An internal investigation."" NO APOLOGY was ever given, and certainly no discount or other means of maintaining a good relationship with the customer. Overall every single staff person we encountered was rude, or misleading: some were both. we will NEVER stay here again. This was our first and last time.

There was no working ice machine on the floor.  Our TV was never able to connect to the pay per view service.  Internet was expensive.  There was a lot of nickel and dime-ing going on.  

In general, the staff was rude and unhelpful.  My mother is diabetic and needs to refrigerate her medicine.  She called the front desk to ask about getting a refrigerator.  They transferred her 3 times.  One person told her that the fridge would be $20.  But the manager said that it would be no charge because it was for her medicine.  Good thing we checked our bill on the way out, because there was an $80 charge for the fridge - $20 PER DAY (we weren't even there for four days - we checked in at 7 PM for a three night stay).   The girl at the desk was nasty about removing the charge, which she did eventually do. 

The one saving grace this hotel has (aside from the price) is the pool.  The shark tank mesmerized my son and he swam and played for hours while I read and sat in the sun.  The waitresses in the pool area were the most friendly people on staff and the Bloody Mary I had poolside was great.

The rooms are nice (ours had a small vanity with a light up mirror) and the staff is pleasant, but what I really love is the pool area. My bf and I like to hang out Downtown, and when it's warm out we go get some food and sit in the pool chairs to eat and watch the fish swim, or to practice our Blackjack. Those pool chairs are more comfortable than the beds at Binion's (look up my review)! Also, they offer coupon books depending on your reservation, which have good deals. I like the Carson Street Cafe, which is featured in the coupon book.

My bf's parents recently stayed in the new Rush Tower so we got to see what the new rooms look like. All I can say is, wow. Modern, classy, and warm, all in one. The room and bathroom are luxurious while still being comfortable. It has a very warm feeling inside, offsetting the feeling of staying in a hotel in Vegas. What I REALLY loved about the new rooms are that instead of having a random chair or 2 to lounge in, there was a corner leather couch located directly next to the window. You can sit in comfort and enjoy the great view. They had a view of the Strip, facing south, that looks really cool at night. The only negative I'd say are the gambling odds.

The casino had all the familiar offerings, minus one or two state of the art computerized money-takers.  Table minimums were very affordable ($10 min blackjack, $5 min roulette), and they didn't take all our money in the first 5 minutes.

Poker Room-The dealers at the poker room are the finest dealers in the casino. Very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.

We waited til about 2:45 and I walked back to the lounge to see if the room was close to being ready. I was helped by a different woman who told me no, with no smile on her face. Said that it could be anywhere between 3:00 and 6:00. I told her that I wasn't aware of that. She didn't mind me walking out feeling confused and feeling like I was a burden. She didn't want to be bothered. I checked my email to see if there was any mention of 3-6 PM check in. It clearly said 3:00. So I walked back in at 3:00 and spoke to another woman and showed her my email. Meanwhile, the other woman who I had spoken to 15 mins before was behind her and didn't even acknowledge me or try to fix the situation. This last woman was just as rude as the other 2. Unbelievable. She just looked at me and said it is 3-6. I told her that nowhere in my email does it say that, so how do we fix this?  She rudely told me they have a room ready for me.

Definitely one of the nicest hotels downtown as far as looking more modern. I stayed in the Rush tower which was very nice, I wasn't expecting it to be so clean and chic. 
The bathroom was spacious, big bath tub and double shower heads were a nice touch. Very comfy beds and a big window with a view. 
I got drinks at that bar with the big fish tank, which was enjoyable to just sit by and sip cocktails with my fiancé. I was given free champagne in the watch store to sip while browsing. 
I went to the pool but it was really packed so I just ended up grabbing a beer and hanging out in the shade with my friends. It wasn't loud considering how many people were there.

The beds were comfortable, the rooms just redone, however a little pricy at 150$ after taxes for a room with two small beds. First off, the pool closes at 10pm, and thats just wrong for a city that never sleeps. The women there were mediocre. The food was also mediocre at a high price. The drinks? Well, let me tell you my story. So i left my room about 11pm, with 40$, went down to the bar near the exit by fremont street, at the lowest level of the casino. This is where i had the worst service in my life. I sat down, and waited 15 minutes waving and yelling trying to flag down one of the bartenders, who kept making eye contact, but passing by, finally, he asked what I wanted, I told him makers mark on the rocks and asked him how much, to which he replied he could not comp the drink, and then walked away without taking my order for another 15 minutes. with a super annoying attitude like he was racist against me or my father inlaw who is hispanic. I didnt ask for it to be comped, i was going to pay straight up with a 20$ bill and leave him a tip, however i decided to hell with him, and put the money in the machine so I could ""Get comped"". So i asked the gentlemen sitting next to me if service is always this bad, and he was from london, and said he had just arrived, i complained that the bartender with the mustache was being rude, so he then flagged down the man and told him to get me a drink, i wa astonished that he payed attention, but the british man was gray haired and in his 60s, he me got service immediately. Then the bar tender pointed to the plaq on the machine which read, to get comped drinks you must put a $20 in, and be playing $1.00 per round, which i was doing, and i told the bartender i put 20 in and are currently playing a dollar hand, he then rolled his eyes and made my drink, which i downed immediately because he pissed me off, huge mistake, worst customer service, he didnt come take an order for another 20 minutes, i was getting really angry, he pushed a large black trash can right infront of me, and was throwing beer bottles from across the room breaking glas right infrontofme and my father inlaw. Finally he came by and gave me another drink, i still had 5$ in the machine after i had finished the drink, i kept flagging him down but he kept walking by, so if he wouldntserve me i refused to play until he took my order, when he walked up and said and pointed at the plaq again, and told me i have to put 20 in and be betting a dollar, repeating what he said eairler, and he wentback to breaking glass infront of our face from acrosstheroom. I was very irritated so i kept playing and flagging him down, i had $1.25 left, and i got him to talkto me. Finally after beingthere for an hour he said he wouldnt serve me because i only had $1.00 currently in play and .25 cents left. The plaq didnt say that, thats not the rules, so i finished my bet and left, i almost waited aroundfor him to get off work. It was a complete waste of time and money. Exceptthe pool. Which was still a waste of time causeitcloses. At 10pm. I hope management reads this and does something because no one should be throwing bottleslike that. He was about 55-65 years old, white balding head, white moustache, old white man about 5feet 7 inches tall. The bar at the rear entrance near the tables. For thisyou. Get 1 star",1,0,0

Well, we expected to pay more than what we're used to but we were quoted $70 for a wash, cut and blow dry and ended up getting charged $155 at the register.

Staff was friendly and attentive. I was worried that housekeeping was going to hate us, we had been on a cruise for a week then driven up to Vegas and had 6 bags and I was trying to find things in each of them. I did try to pick up after myself, but at the same time was exhausted and just wanted to go have fun. They picked up and kept the place cleaned. We stayed in the Carson Tower and had asked for two queen beds or one king. I like the extra bed to put things on but the hotel was nearly full when we booked so they booked us a two queen room. We checked in she let us know they only had a two bed room and could change us the next day if we wanted (6 bags.....) Got upstairs and was hugely disappointed to find it was two DOUBLE beds not queen, we are not big people we are both under 6ft and pretty average sized but come on 2 people in a double bed? Went to ask about the King room the next to get told they are sold out .. REALLY???? so I booked my room through you not a booking agent 4 weeks ago and I am stuck with 2 double beds? 

The tub was a little weird it kind of curves at the middle of the tub (like a u shape) so you get off balance if you step to the side ( I was sober and our friends said the same of their room) 

The toilet- now remember we have been on a cruise for a week so used to VERY loud toilets, dear lord the thing in the hotel scared me half to death- we were there fro drag racing I am used to loud that thing is powerful enough to suck down a small child!

I picked a slot machine and played the SAME machine for three hours.  Not once did it go into a bonus.  Granted I did not spend a ton of money on it, but there is something definitely wrong with a machine when it doesn't go into a bonus after three hours.  I contacted a slot attendant to call a floor manager.  No one ever came to speak with me; however, a manager lurked behind me watching me play (I let the attendant know that the machine had not went into a bonus in three hours).  After I spent the money I put in, I called for another manager.  The lurking one approached only after the second visited with me, and confirmed that the machine had not gone into a bonus the whole time he was watching me.  They could not provide me a reason to why it was happening nor did they seem to care.

I have been gaming for over 10 years.  I understand that gaming is gambling.  However, GN is using a machine that is obviously not functioning correctly.  They did not offer any suggestions, so I asked for the gaming commission's number to report the issue.  I requested the machine be shut down until the commission could review.  They did, but then later turned the machine back on.  The commission took my complaint and told me that they would be assigning the case.

Sorry, will not be visiting GN in the foreseeable future.  I wish that the manager could have offered some explanation.  I wasn't asking for a handout and was polite.  Nothing.

The room itself was very ambient, almost posh. To give an example, the mirror in the bathroom has a TV in it. I don't see that kind of flair very often.

The downside to this room was the tub\/shower itself. It was difficult to take one due to the spacing issues and just seem to be broken down and\/or not working the way that is expected of such.

We ate at the buffet and it was pretty bad.  If you like Costco desserts and pressed prime rib slabs, I suppose it would have been okay.  The waitress was nice, and she was empathetic to the raw blintzes, oil soaked tater tots, and undercooked sausage.  The coffee was good.  
My biggest gripe was the fact that I complained several times to the managers about the activity on our floor and nothing was done about it.  There was a pot smoking bicycle club staying at the hotel for a convention, and many of them were on our floor.  Our floor, was supposed to be NON SMOKING.  I guess marijuana doesn't count, as the air was thick with it.  I heard the housekeepers complaining about it, as well.  Also, the bikes were moved from the lobby to the rooms over and over, so you couldn't get in the elevator to get to your room.  I went to the lobby and mentioned this TWICE.  Nothing was done.  I suppose the cherry on the top of the cake was when I returned to my room early Sunday morning, to find a long line of vomit running down the hall.  I called the front desk to report it, but nothing was done because the next morning,It was still there, just sunk into the carpet somewhat.  I wanted to love this place.  I love the feel of the old glamour.  However, it's just kind of dumpy.",0,1,0

The room was nice and spacious, with a very luxurious king bed, but as another reviewer noted the room is very dark and the lighting is extremely dim affording zero help if you want to read in bed.  

Our room had operational issues daily (i.e.: faulty showerhead that needed replacing, daily blown fuse in bathroom, non-working switches, etc.).  Worse, when we tried to get these things attended to by directly addressing the VIP Lounge staff these issues went unresolved.  One example (of THREE): we went to the VIP Lounge to alert the staff to have our bathroom lights fixed while we were out for dinner and asked that in concert with our turn-down service (one of the listed amenities for the Club Level) we needed replacement towels since we had to clean up the bathroom ourselves after the showerhead was replaced earlier that day.  When we returned 3 hours later we were disappointed to find nothing had been taken care of and though we figured out and fixed our lighting issue ourselves, the turn-down service never happened. (The DND was not on the door so not the excuse.)

The Club Level amenities are overstated at best and undelivered at worst -- absolutely not worth the higher rate.  The ice machine was out of service and though we told the VIP staff about this it went unrepaired.  The table with nuts and M&Ms at the elevators was usually a sloppy mess and unappealing.  The coffee is touted as Starbucks and that simply cannot be true for as bad of brew as it was.  The coffee accoutrements were paltry (no Sweet n' Low) and one  1\/2 &  1\/2 carton was put out un-chilled (which was fine because it ran out by 9am).  How hard is it to have a decent coffee station presentation with a thermos for the cream and the gamut of sugars\/sweeteners - especially if you're selling a VIP experience?

In the staff's defense, every time I called the general number at the front desk, I was helped quickly.  The Valet\/Bell personnel were fast, friendly and helpful.  We did not try any of the restaurants nor did we gamble at this property so cannot speak to these offerings.  Lastly, we did ask for a late check-out and were told that ""suites are not eligible for late check-out"" - yet another reason not to pay more money for less service and unfulfilled expectations.  If the price were right, I might book this hotel again, but I'd never book the Club Level and in any event would check-in with low expectations.  I will be writing the management a letter of complaint regarding this stay.   The Golden Nugget should not have the audacity to call any of their Club Services ""VIP"" - total bait and switch there.",0,1,0

They have a Monopoly game there that is freakin' addicting....aside from the fact that it pays out too!!! They only have four of those machines in the casino (and as far as I know, the only ones in Vegas!) and they aren't the annoying electronic newer ones it's the ""reel"" deal with the actual reels spinning in your face!!!!

I told her to throw some of that luck my way and shook her hand. She told me that she appreciated me shaking her hand & that I was good people  and then gave me $30.

Once we got to golden nugget valet, valet was full. So we had to park elsewhere (which was another huge ordeal) and walk to the pool. 

When we arrived, it was super busy. (We expected that since it was Saturday.) My friends and I all agreed to get a table so we can get bottle service. One of the waitresses got us a table within 20 minutes of our arrival. Once we asked for a drink\/bottle menu, it took her 20 minutes to deliver us one. We eventually got tired during our wait and went to the bar ourselves and grabbed our own drinks. 

The shark tank is cool but quite small. Sort of makes you feel bad how many sharks are in this tank with such limited space. 

Children everywhere...EVERYWHERE! And since the adult section was beyond full, we had to hang around with them. I don't hate children, but I just didn't feel right having cocktails and smoking cigs next to one. 

The worst part was people swimming in their clothes. Men jumping in with their basketball shorts and old tshirts. Women in their basketball jerseys while wearing old sneakers to swim in. Babies swimming in soiled diapers. I found that quite trashy because all other hotel pools forbid any other attire other than swim suits and sandals inside the pool. 

Once we got to top section of the hotel pool, (the adults section finally has some vacancy) it was a bit more relaxing but the music was different from downstairs. I swear it was putting me to sleep. 

You'd be better off going to the pool during the weekday where it's less busy with people and children. It was obvious the waitresses couldn't handle the rush which took forever to recieve proper service. Last year, 2013 I had a blast but that's cause I went on a Monday afternoon.

Well, it wasn't. Plus, they have a brand new pool with a 'shark tank' in the middle of it. So basically you're swimming amongst sharks (or so it seems).

Lil guy was impressed. He wanted to go swim in the pool but it was slightly chilly and plus we weren't staying there. They even have card tables set up by the pool with chairs so you can get a couple of games in while you have your swim.

Check In : We arrived at 9am and went to check in to see if we could possibly get into our rooms early (We had 5). They told us possibly by 11am. Normal check in is 3pm. So we checked our luggage and went to gamble. Came back around Noon and stil no go on the rooms. Okay, no big deal. Came back later and see a long line.

Casino : The casino is small in comparison to the ones on the strip, but it's great and every dealer, waitress, etc was great. We all had a blast.

Pool : The pool is amazing, it's beautiful. We also loved playing BJ and Craps out in the beautiful weather. The prices on alcohol are a high but actually pretty reasonable as far as Vegas goes. And of course don't miss the slide through the shark tank.

We arrived about 7 hours too early (can you say excited much!). But we went up to the desk and asked if we could do an early check in. Not only was there no fee to check in early but they upgraded our room for free too because the room we were supposed to have wasn't ready yet!!! WOOT WOOT! 

The first thing we did was order room service breakfast. Hey at 8am in Vegas you know you want some food in ya before you start all that drinking! The Eggs Benedict was AMAZING!!!! 

While we didn't swim because it was too cold when we went on our trip, we did walk around and look at the super cool shark tank and awesome lounge areas. Going to be giving that a try next time we go. 

Neither one of us play on the card tables so I can't really say anything to that. But the staff at the bars with the video pokers are neat and the machines pay out pretty well.

Some things operated fantastically, and some failed miserably. 

The valet folks operated like as you'd ever want. They had the door open, the car up quick, greeted me by name, and were flawless. 

The staff at the front desk was cordial and efficient. 

The bellman was awesome, willing to do whatever was needed. We can't remember the last time a bellman has asked if we needed ice in our room. This is a great example of an era of customer service that has fallen off the map. 

The room service folks were horrible. It would take the use of capital letters and a long period of writing to adequately explain the frustration. The Reader's Digest version of the story is that my wife was arriving before me and I attempted to arrange for a bottle of champagne to be delivered to the room upon her arrival. I called, we reviewed wines, I made a selection, I allowed the man to up sell me some chocolate covered strawberries, and all that arrived were the berries. When the berries arrived my wife asked about the champagne (I had tipped her off as I got a bad feeling about this transaction when they called me to explain that nobody with my name was checking in) and the lady was going to check into it. My wife waits a half hour and there is no communication. Sorry, this is the Reader's Digest version. 

Also, my wife had, for the first time in a long time, to send a meal back at the 'grotto'. Not good at all.

- $10 for coffee you brew yourself in your own room
- $13 a day for WiFi (even though there are free ones intercepting theirs)
- They do not assist you with public transport
- The pool closes at 5 pm. Seriously. I'm barely drunk by then. I get off of my work schedule and cannot even enjoy a swim.
- One bath robe. The one place I ever wear a robe and we had to share even though we had multiple people in the room.
- No noise control. 6 rooms down a bachelorette party was up all night screaming with an inflatable penis.
- No shuttle service to the airport.
- Broke my finger trying to push the buttons on the remote. 

The GOOD:
- Location. It was right in the heart of downtown next to the RTC stop which takes you everywhere
- Not a very rowdy place.
- Housekeeping was awesome. They were always a few steps away and were very quick and did not ask questions when the BF and I had an unfortunate flooding incident in the bathroom. What happens in Vegas really does stay there.

Ya know, for the price it's a GREAT hotel.  I found the rooms clean, nicely decorated, friendly staff service, good bathrooms and very comfortable beds.  The room smelled fine.  Free parking.  They build the ""resort fee"" into the price so there's no bullshit ""surprise, it's $17 more per day!"".

Con:  
-no free wifi (like $12 a day or something)
-$20 per day to use the gym, but if you do you have access to the hot tub, sauna, really nice bathrooms with free-to-borrow robes, slippers, grooming supplies...a bit pricey for those who really want to work out several times but you do feel very pampered!

Upon making reservations we were upsild on the ""VIP"" experience where you skip lines, get free bottles of water and access to the VIP lounge. This cam at an expence of over 100 dollar for the two rooms we booked.
We also asked multiple times about the pool being open, the tube slide as well as the shark exibit. Everything was aligned f9r a great vacation. Once we actually got to the GNLV we quickly realized that it was a mistake.
The vip check in was closed
The pool was mostly roped off due to the slide being closed and the shark was no where to be seen since it was cleening week for the big tank and they had 2 divers in the tank instead.
One the first night we were awoken by the fire alarms going off due to some jack wagon vaping in the hallway. 
Each day we had to remind the front desk of our free water that did not get delivered and according to the hotel websitr the VIP get news papers as well but those never showed up. Not that anyone actually reads a paper but if you advertise it is included, you should follow through.
Since we booked our room through travelocity we were also reminded that any issues we brought up we to be taken up through the ""3rd party"" for resolve. 
We were harrassed outside of the hotel each night we went to freemont street or the name they should give it...freeloader street and were rem8nded each time that if we can afford to be on vacation we can afford to hand out money to these people parked right oitside with their 5 gallon buckets full of change.
We started to enjoy our stay when we used the room as a pit stop rather than a place to relax. Get up, get ready and go to another hotel\/casino for the day. Come back so tired that the noise from the parking lot would not wake you up. Oh, and garbage is picked up at 6am each day. The constant beebing from the truck is how i know this.
We will not stay at this hotel again, the idea of old vegas is not what it percieves and the reviews of this hotel are not factual. There is one of the 4 towers at this hotel that may be where all the 10's and 5 stars are coming from. It us the rush tower. But if you are in the carson tower, with VIP...this is not worth it at any price. 
They did try to call and make it right but if your  going to treat people different because of booking through 3rd party sites like travelocity...you have earned this 2 star.
Personnally, i think Tillman should spend a few of his billions while he brags on TV and find some hospitality training for his people who work for him.

Very sad experience.

Oh, i forgot. Our credit card was hacked also and the only time it was used was for booking this hotel. That was the cherry on top. Thankfully we caught it in time. I cant trust GNLV with credit cards now.... very shady

When people say the place smells like smoke...they are spot on. You cant walk through this lobby even at a brisk pace and not come out of it smelling like an ash tray. The hotel is old, the ability to move clean air.... i dont think they have the ability like the newer places. AND the tables could use a cleaning as well.

The public areas of the hotel are lovely...our room was another story.  We stayed in the Gold Tower Gold Club rooms on the 17th floor which is only accessible with your room key.  For the first day, we were both cursing out the elevator AND our room entry system.  The room key was more miss than hit on the first day, by the end of our stay, it was more hit than miss.  Neither of us had the energy to deal with the lines at registration to get new keys...we just dealt with it.

The Gold Club rooms are DARK.  You can barely see a thing without all the lights turned on in the room.  The postage stamp sized window offered almost no natural lighting.  The air conditioning unit is HUGE and hidden in a wooden box that looks like a bench under the window.  It is also very noisy and loud.  You either have it on and suffer the noise at night or you turn it off and the room gets stuffy and warm.  The bathroom is the part of the room with the best lighting.  Unfortunately the bathroom is very narrow and takes a lot of maneuvering to get into the closet (it's behind the bathroom door and the door has to be closed in order to open the closet doors).  The only way to turn on the shower to warm up the water first is to get in, turn the water on, and turn the lever that turns the shower on while at the same time trying to get out of the tub before the cold water hits you on the head and hopefully you won't fall and kill yourself before being doused with cold water.

Free Wi-Fi!  Uh huh, but it only worked some of the time.

If there's a casino on Fremont that I prefer over others, it would definitely be the Golden Nugget.  This place has changed in the last couple of years.  I remember when I was only 14 years old walking her from the Excalibur.  Forward 20+ years later and I am still walking here, but from the Main Street Parking Log. 

When I have friends come around from out of town, they always want to go to Fremont Street and this is where I take them. When I think of Golden Nugget, I think of 4 different types of casinos.

1st:  You get the Fremont Experience side where it's mostly your table games and slots.  Your typical ""Vegas Baby"" crowd of course, but also a large amount of locals donating their paychecks. 

2nd:  You get the lobby area, which has been remodeled.  Nice fish\/shark tank bam!! in your face. 

3rd.  You get close to the family atmosphere near their cafe and pool.  

4th:  You got upstairs where there's more eats and a lot quieter.  

There was a time I came out here almost weekly because they had some of the juiciest poker games.  I'm not even talking high limit. I'm small time for sure, but not uncommon to make some dough on the 2\/4 game here.  Tons of action with tons of calling stations.  I know, I know.  I better be quiet and quit tapping the aquarium. 

As for the atmosphere, I like it.  Never an issue with the staff from their restaurants to their bar to their poker room.  Golden Nugget will not set you back because everything here is fairly cheap, except the gambling obviously

My only issue is with their pool. The fish tank is impressive, but not a fan of their pool being smack in your face when you walk their casino. I'm still  a believer that you should be in the pool area to enjoy the pool area.  

Why the 4 stars then??  I like their poker room.  One of the few places to play where you can make some money, not lose as much, and enjoy the players here.  I've met a lot of good people from different parts of the world here.  They don't take it so serious out here and also don't mind giving you their money.",5,2,4
2689540,Ns_wHebqn2WYKvo2_ZuGlQ,vf4vSva7sCI0K4UAjHrJgw,BIBWGO_r_1znnlmLbp4Nxg,4,2014-02-24,"Ahh, the Golden Nugget, we had our ups and downs during my 5-night stay, but overall you treated me very well. I really dig the more down-to-earth, old school vibe of Downtown Las Vegas compared to The Strip, and the Golden Nugget is the nicest and most complete casino in the area. Many components come together to make a full casino experience, so I'll review each of the components individually.

The Rooms: Unless you are spending a lot of time in you room - and this is Vegas, so you shouldn't be - a basic room is the way to go. And their basic room in the Carson Tower is nice. Ample space, nice TV (that I hardly turned on), a good bathroom, and clean with upscale decor. No free internet is a minus, but even after paying for internet, the rooms averaged out at $65\/night including taxes and resort fees. However, they were doing work on my floor that week - running new phone\/internet cables - and the noise woke me up multiple times. (Yes, I was sleeping until 11AM, but I mean, this IS Vegas) I know casinos never close and this was probably factored into the cost of my room, but I could have stayed at another place Downtown for cheaper with no construction. 3.5 Stars.

The Casino: This is the most complete casino in the Downtown area. Their Poker Room is a bit old school, but still nice. The dealers there are generally nice, fun people to be with, and there is a nice variety of people coming in. Tournaments are run three times a day. If poker isn't your thing, they have a load of slots and table games throughout the casino, including both poolside and in their lounge where live music is frequently playing. Regardless if I am staying here or at another Downtown casino, it's a given that I'll be gambling here. 4.5 Stars

Restaurant Selection: Golden Nugget is owned by Landry's, who owns such posh restaurant chains like M&S and Morton's, so it's to be expected that they do high-end well. The problem is that most people staying Downtown are looking for value. I'm sure Vic & Anthony's and Chart House are good, but those aren't places for an ""everyday"" meal. The Grotto is pretty good - it's not cheap eats but it is moderately priced and a good value for what you get. I thought the Happy Hour specials at Red Sushi were good. But for late-night eats your only option is The Grille, a small counter-service establishment. It was decent, but you don't get that classic Vegas 3AM dive\/diner experience. 3.5 Stars

That averages to a just under 4-stars, and I'll jump them up to 4-stars for genuinely nice and efficient customer service and an excellent pool area that allows one to get some rest while nursing a hangover after you have checked out and are waiting for your flight. (For example) 

If you are looking to experience the value and classic vibe of ""Old Vegas"" but with a touch of class you get from The Strip, Golden Nugget is the way to go.",6,3,2

This review is specifically for their unethical practice of time clock altering in their parking structure to cheat customers out of a few bucks. 

Upon entry, you get a time stamped ticket showing the time of entry. When it is time to exit, you put the same ticket into a reader at the exit gate and it reads the entry and exit time and calculates the cost. All pretty straight forward. However, this is where things go haywire. The entry time clock is always a few minutes early - earlier than the true time. And the exit clock miraculously are always showing the time as later than the real time. On the last trip, Golden Nugget's parking entry clock was early by a few minutes as usual. Upon exit, their clock was showing time that was at least 10 minutes later than real time. This was confirmed by my watch, which was calibrated against the National Institute of Standards and Technology at www.time.gov, not to mention all cell phones now days have clocks that are also calibrated against a standard that  isn't more than 15 seconds off. The parking attendant said even if I were one minute over that I'd have to pay the full price for the next hour. I advised that their clocks were off and the attendant understood that I wasn't going to back down and that I have proof so the extra cost for the additional hour was not charged. 

In years past, the Golden Nugget gave the first 3 hours free so it was never an issue with their fake clock settings - I never stayed more than 3 hours. However, within the last few years, there are no longer any free parking downtown and now the Golden Nugget have changed their parking fees accordingly. There is no longer free parking for the first 3 hours unless you stay at the casino or eat in their restaurants. No problem with that - at least have correct clock settings in the parking structure and not try to game your customers dishonestly. This has been going on for more than 20 years so is not an isolated occurrence. 

Bottom line - you will be cheated out of your money if you don't pay attention even if you don't gamble at this casino.",2,1,0

It's clean, it's not smoke filled and we had a blast in the pool! 
We stayed in a Gold Club room and loved how clean and quiet it was. There were some signs of wear in the bathroom...someone left behind some fingernail polish on the granite counter top...hope they were charged for the damage! But no big deal...it didn't effect our enjoyment of the LCD TV in the mirror of the bathroom. 
The view from our room was of the pool and the new (in construction phase) tower. Not all that impressive but if a view is important to you then stay at Red Rock Canyon! 
The Gold Club room floors are only accessed by key card from the elevators and are supplied with bottled water, coffee and tea and open refreshments of jelly beans, chocolate covered raisins, m-n-m's, trail mix, and fruit such as apples and bananas. It was nice to have these available just outside of the elevator. 
Food at the Golden Nugget restaurants was very good; except the buffet...it was just so-so; edible just not that exciting. However, the pizza at the Grotto was to die for. It had a nice thin crust and it was nice-n-bubbly hot from the oven; a very Neapolitan style pizza, yum! Plus, the coffee from the Grotto rocked! I especially liked their service of ""sugar-in-the-raw"" for my coffee...couldn't find this stuff anywhere else in Vegas...weird! 
The Valet service was fantastic. They worked extremely hard in some extreme temperatures for some extreme crowds and did a great job! 
OK, on to the ""construction issues""...yes, they are undergoing some construction of a new tower and some of the streets are closed, etc...deal with it peeps! If there wasn't some sort of construction or deconstruction going on, would it really be Vegas?! 
The Fremont Street experience is a hoot and I love ""Old Downtown"". Next time you go, stay at the Nugget. You will be pleasantly surprised!

they force you to walk through and by every slot machine & gambling device in the casino twice going each way to tempt you to gamble. The Hotel\/Casino got rid of its good home cooking restaurants with good food and only have commercialized expensive chain restaurant crap food now --- the same chain restaurants that I can get ripped off going to in Los Angeles, no incentive to go to Las Vegas --- just stay home--- we have Indian casinos here with better food ---- also Las Vegas dot com switched our hotel without our permission--- I asked for the four queens and they gave us the golden nugget they gave the excuse later that they are owned by the same people ---- but they are still not the same hotel even if they are owned by different people --- the four queens is a small old style home like casino with its own restaurant and the golden nugget is a huge commercialized piece of shit that is so big that an older person is not able to walk it and is a prisoner of their room or the area around their room where they can walk. 2) The second thing the golden nugget has a balcony over looking Fremont street, 
where you can order drinks and eat and watch the band and activities below--- somehow they purposely turned up the heat on this balcony so it was intolerable to sit on it because it was to hot---- when we complained they lied and said it was just the Las Vegas heat and said we should come inside and sit at the gambling tables where it was cool ----thinking we were stupid hicks from out of town or something and trying to manipulate us into gambling and losing all our money. WE WENT OUTSIDE ACROSS THE STREET TO THE PATIO BAR AT THE HORSESHOE CASINO AND THEY HAD A COOL MIST OF WATER SPRAYING ON EVERYONE IN THE BAR AND THEIR DRINKS AND FOOD WERE CHEAPER---- also the temperature on Fremont street when we walked up to the other band in front of the golden gate casino was just fine ---- no problem --- also they have no place to sit on Fremont so the only place you can sit down is inside at the gambling tables where you will lose all your money. They did not build all those expensive casinos with winners ONLY LOSERS ---- I would like to complain that all I got was manipulated and lied to most everywhere I went with my experience in Las Vegas, even the outlet center is no longer outlet stores but just a regular shopping center with regular prices but they misrepresent themselves as giving a discount when they don't ---- they also charge a rip off resort fee --- added to your bill ---- except at places like the embassy suites or motel six ------ Hilton hotels do not charge resort fees or chain hotels do not ---- only casino\/hotels that work you and try to rip you off for money from the moment you enter the city -------- the food sucks in vegas now -- just commercialized restaurant chains with mass production food ---- nothing special anymore, plus there are no good shows anymore in Vegas, no first rated groups or celebrities----- just second rate crap shows with above average prices ------- THE BANDS OB FREMONT STREET WERE OUTSTANDING AND THE MOB MUSEUM
WERE REALLY GOOD -------- the rooms were expensive and the location of the towers sucked--- the amount of walking to get anywhere was ridiculous----in fact older people could not do it ---- many of them sitting around unable to walk the huge distance required to get from rooms to Fremont street",1,5,0

We had no other choice than the Golden Nugget or the Stratosphere. ""It wont be that bad"", my boyfriend said trying to cheer me up, ""they just remodeled"". Ha! What a joke. We couldn't wait to get the hell out of the place. 

First off, when we made our reservations we were never told that as a ""Rush Tower"" guest we had our own private entrance and reception desk. So there goes half the fun right out the window. When we arrived in our room I was shocked by how hip and modern the remodel appeared to be, ""yea, this isn't so bad"" I assured myself. Well in just a few short moments that thought was gone. First our shower head didn't work. At all. A quick call to maintenance and a pot-bellied work horse was attempting to fix our shower head. Sexy huh? Oh I'm in the Vegas mood now! 45 minutes later, he got it working. Next we decided to order a movie to find the speakers were blown out on the TV, so our film sounded like a 3rd grader trying to talk into a microphone where they insist on shoving their mouths into it. A quick call to the front desk and our movie was refunded. On our way out to hit the strip, we walked through the casino and the fake facade of decadence to find that their sushi restaurant smelled of grandpas feet meets back alley fish slaughter house. I cant imagine anyone would have eaten there. They next morning we were awoken at 7am to the lovely tapping of the housekeeper trying to get into our room. 7am, seriously? Finally, ready to leave to go check into a real hotel, we though hey, lets go use our private valet where there is no line!

The Grotto Italian Restaurant is fabulous.  Best amenity is the Shark Tank pool by far.  We rented a cabana for one of the days (Hideout Premium Cabana) and was the best experience.  Highly recommended!  It has it's own pool (16+ and older only), on the 3rd level near the slide entrance.

If you get Melinda as your attendant, she is great and makes fabulous recommendations.

Other things to note for the hotel in general: states they do not charge a resort fee, which they do not charge but there is a $5.00 daily downtown fee.  Still way cheaper than what they charge on the strip.  Take your own kcup coffees!  Every room has a single cup coffee maker BUT there is a $10 charge for the little 4pack kcups in the room.

I was so disappointed with this hotel! I've stayed a few places on Fremont street and this was by far the worst! My husband and I are local, we came to Golden Nugget about a month ago to tour their suites because we planned on getting married in one of them. The bellman Paul was awesome and showed them all to us and gave us tons of tips to make our day go smoothly. He can have 5 stars for sure!

We booked the Spa Suite for one night. Paid well over $800.00 for a pool view suite and expected great service which we did not receive at all. We were told when booking that we could try to check in as early as 12pm and would have our room by 3pm for sure. So we made all our wedding arrangements starting at 3:30 knowing we'd be in our room by then. 

We tried checking in at noon and our room wasn't ready, which was okay. They said they'd call us when it was. 3pm came around and we went to the VIP to check in and they said our room still wasn't ready. Confused we said ""Isn't 3pm check in time for all rooms?"" And the front desk girl said they start check in and 3pm and there was nothing they could do and we'd have to wait until our room was cleaned. Frustrated and starting to panic because we had all sorts of appointments lined up for hair, makeup, officiant, family and friends coming we asked if we can just get into the room and start getting ready and the maids can clean around us since we were on a time crunch and expected and was told our room would be ready by the CHECK IN time. They said no and argued for a bit back and forth about it, finally they agreed to put us in a different room temporarily to start getting ready and then they'd call us when our suite was ready. 

They phoned us at 4:45 that our room was ready. Almost two hours AFTER ""check-in"" time. We rushed into a room to see the temperature was set at 88 and it was boiling in there. We had to rush to get ready, while sweating and melting in our clothes, and rush to get married. Our day was still great because we got married, but it was way more stressful and we were extremely uncomfortable as well as our guests also from being so hot. It took a few hours to cool the room down, which we wanted to start doing at 3pm when they told us we could check in no matter what. 

We also called for a few extra champagne glasses and ice, since you have to call for ice and there are no ice machines on the spa suite tower floors. It took an hour and half to have those brought to our room. 

We paid extra for a pool view so we could have a better view of the city since we planned on getting married in front of the windows. Once we got into our room, we did not have a pool view, all we could see was the ugly roof the Fremont Street Experience. We asked if we could be reimbursed for some of our room since we didn't even get to be in it the whole time and it was the wrong room, and they said no. So we asked for late checkout , they said we could have one extra hour to check out. 

Overall, I'm not one to complain, but when paying A LOT of money, being told 10 different things from different people, and them doing NOTHING to solve any of their errors or problems, I will never stay there or gamble there again or refer anyone else there. 

We are local, and we love going downtown to hang out with friends and guests, we love staying downtown as well. Golden Nugget just left a sour taste in my mouth. I've paid 40 bucks a night on Fremont and had fantastic customer service. This was by far the worst hotel stay in my entire life.

After standing in an hour long taxi line at the airport in 114 degree weather, I agreed just to get into some air conditioning.   I signed the ""check in"" paper when he put it in front of me and was handed my room keys.  When I checked out on the last day I was charged $85 a day for the upgrade instead of the $40 I was quoted.  After being sent to another tower to talk to a manager, she said you signed the paper that said $85!  I told her what the man quoted me, and she said well, you signed it, so that's what we are charging you.... so my bill was $66 a day + $85 more a day for the upgrade without my knowledge of that amount of money being charged.

Citing what many of the Strip properties get away with, they justify the fee to it's guests.  Without any question, the GN is the nicest property Downtown, and thus the issue.

It's Downtown guys, not the strip....The Fremont Expereince has probably saved many of the properties by getting people to come take in the free show.  What percentage of those guests park, see the show and then immediately leave?  Probably not too many.  Most will drink, shop, oh and maybe gamble while there, dontcha think?

Let me give you my two cents:
You feel you need to be the first to put in a fee?  Think the others will follow?  Do yourself a favor if you are not bringing in enough revenue, just build it into your room rates, not as an additional fee.  Which will be better received?  Hellllloooo?  Duh.

Start with the fee?  You just lost a fan and a guest, out of principle I will never stay, shop, eat or gamble in your house.  Why bother?

Okay, okay. I'll tell you a little more. First of all, I love downtown Vegas because it feels like the LV of Elvis and Priscilla and I'm all about that. Also, if you have access to a car to take you to and from the strip, staying downtown is definitely a more economical choice. Plus, the old school vibe of Fremont Street is hard to beat.

When staying at the Golden Nugget, I recommend the rooms in the Rush Tower. They are newly renovated, modern, spacious and really comfortable. 

Oh, and let's not forget that pool. You see, the Golden Nugget's pool is world famous and is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. A glass water slide that goes right through the shark tank located in the middle of the pool? Yep, they have it. If sharks aren't your thing, the GN now has a new pool for the 16+ crowd upstairs.

He and others chose to get a penthouse apartment on AirB&B, and we stayed a few blocks away.  Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I really don't like vacationing in Las Vegas.  Just not my thing.

On walking in, there was the obligatory forced march through the smoky casino with absent\/worthless signage to find the registration desk, which was in a hot lobby with 50 people in line.  There were two people working the desk.  Note to Hotel Management: If those people are standing in line, they're not spending money at your hotel and they're going to write scathing reviews.

Check-in was painless.  I was prepared for the obligatory $25 ""resort"" fee.  At least internet is free.  Oh wait, LOL, you want *working* internet?  That's $10\/day.   Really, just charge me the room rate up front and I'll pay it, but the nickling-and-diming is just offensive.

A call to the front desk to ask ""where's the gym?""  (Not obvious in materials in-room) had me going to a different tower.  I'm a reasonably serious gym rat and this gym is really sub-par.  There was a tiny weight room with three people in it and that made it far too crowded.  There was no floor space for things like lunges or burpees, let alone skaters or anything involving any movement.  There was also a tiny cardio room with some treadmills, a few pump-type stairmaster, and some exercycles (not even proper spin bikes).  

The bed is comfy, although a Queen comes with two pillows and a pillow roll.  The rooms in the Carson Tower are 1994 chique, but clean and comfortable enough.  Think your generic Marriott or Westin.

CES tops 150,000 visitors during this week.  The freeway entrance is very close to this hotel.  The LV Convention Center isn't more than a 15 minute drive on the freeway.

The Golden Nugget Hotel in downtown Vegas is small compared to the Las Vegas Strip Hotels. You have less cars and less people, this is the place if you can't deal with that.  I like this hotel because the parking lot (Carson Towers) is closer than any of the strip hotels. The walk from parking lot to room is within 5+ minutes. If you go out (back and forth) a lot than this makes it easy.  I think this is still faster than a valet at a Strip Hotel, which is what I would do if I was on the LV Strip with my family.

If you are looking for glitter and glitz don't go here.  This hotel isn't a Red Rock and not the most romantic hotel, but the rooms are actually nice and maintained.  I don't normally see many kids at this hotel walking around. There isn't any arcade or kid friendly things here.  If you have a family I would pick a different hotel. For business or friends trip this hotel is great for that. 

Also being in downtown is very strategic, meaning easy to get around in a car.  With easy freeway access, we actually can get to hotels like Venetian, MGM, Chinatown pretty quick avoiding congestion. 

Some Tips: 

1) They have a breakfast buffet on the 2nd floor and a restaurant on the first floor.  The breakfast\/brunch is pretty good at both places.  Never had dinner here.  

2) They have a Keurig Coffee maker, make sure you bring your own K-cups. We always stop at the market for a case of 24 bottles of water for coffee and drinking. 

3) They have a beautiful shark aquarium in the middle of their swimming pool. This is a nice place to get a drink and relax, but in January it is cold!  

4) Get on their Email mailing list.  During the month there seems to be a coupon deal, like by get 2 meals for 1, drink coupons, etc.

They started charging a resort fee as of the first of the year. They try to sell it as a benefit since you get the pool, two bottles of water a day, and limited internet access. Conveniently they forgot to mention that coffee in the room costs $10 and there is no hairdryer. I just left a hotel in Laughlin that cost $18 per night but it had a blow dryer and a fraction of the people at the pool. 

I am moving to the Fremont across the street tomorrow as the resort fee plus an increased rate on a Wednesday(?) priced me out of here. Cost was almost triple Tuesday night...fine with me.",6,1,0

I live in California and have been coming to Las Vegas 2 to 3 times per year for the last 15 years and I aways stay at the Golden Nugget.  Since the remodel and additions, it is very noticable that the Carson Tower does not get the same attention as past years.  1) When I made my reservations over the phone, the agent told me about the Downtown Resort Fee.  He also told me that if I gamble with my 24 Carat Club card and eat at a restaraunt in the hotel, that this fee will be comp'd, but it wasn't. Instead the check out agent told me that it doesn't work that way. What ever happended to good customer service. This is only at $15 charge and the hotel would rather stick it to the guests than have a bad review and potentially lose the business of others reading this review.  I know I won't be back  2) I called housekeeping for a blanket. After 3 hours I called them back.  They told me that they would take care of it immediately.  It took 1 hour. 3) The rooms always had refrigerators but now you have to rent them.  The hotel claims that they never had refrigerators in the Carson Tower. I guess I was special.  4) The shower walls and bathroom floors had Mold in the grout all over. 5) Housekeeping never replenished the shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, etc. I had to buy shampoo and conditioner at the ABC store. 6) I tried to use the fitness center but you now have to pay to use it.

The rate through Hotels.com was very attractive for an early June weekend, so we jumped on it. Overall it was just fine, superbly located for hanging around downtown, hitting the East Fremont hipsterville, and for shooting down to hot Strip hotels via the Industrial\Frank Sinatra\Dean Martin\Harmon shortcuts that avoid all traffic, even on a Saturday night. The hotel was clean, the room (in the older but cheaper and much quieter Carson Tower) was just fine (old school furnishings but in good shape), the access to the parking structure from the Carson Tower elevators was quick and easy, they had no problem with us bringing in a big cooler, the staff was helpful and friendly, and the atmosphere was laid back and a nice break from Fremont, which can look like a downscale Wal-Mart with slot machines at times. I'll definitely consider the Nugget for our next Vegas getaway

To be honest, we didn't gamble much here, given that other places within a short stroll have lower minimums (El Cortez), better rules (Golden Gate for craps, El Cortez for BJ and looser slots), faster free drinks (Mermaids), and more lively action (The D, Golden Gate). Still, it was nice to have a quiet drink in one of the Nugget's ""less smoke"" bars and mindlessly play a little video poker now and then.

I would caution you about the pool, however. Even though the Nugget touts its pool as the gem of downtown, the lounge area is way too small for the number of people who use it, even on a Friday or Monday. Lounges fill up even before the pool opens, primarily by people who dump their towels and books to ""reserve"" a spot for the whole day, even if they've gone elsewhere. There are a lot of kids running around due to the Shark Tank slide, kids I never saw in the hotel at other times so I suspect that they are non-guests, and it's a noisy experience. Alas, bringing outside booze and food are strictly forbidden. A quieter and smaller ""adult"" pool is available, but you have to pay $20 to get one of the lounges (very lame). Both pools are often in the shadow of the Rush Tower, and the lower one gets stuffy because it sits in a hole surrounded by four buildings. I live in the SoCal desert and have my own pool so I didn't need to spend much time at the Nugget's, but when I lived in L.A. and used to come to Vegas primarily for the pleasure of laying out by the water, having a beer, and getting a tan and a nap to recharge before going crazy at night, I would have not enjoyed the Nugget as a pool destination. Even The D's small, spare pool might be a better choice if you want to avoid screaming kids and lounges packed in so close together you can't move them an inch (even if nobody is sitting next to you).

Another problem is weekend parking. The structure is small and barely big enough to handle the guests during the week. Come the weekend though, it fills up quickly with both guests and visitors, so you can return from the Strip on a Friday night to find that there is no place for you to park. Not good. They close off the structure to non-guests in the early evening but that's too late. Be prepared to have to leave your car with the valet or park on a dark street down the block; if you do, go give the manager a piece of your mind. I did. 

Finally, the Golden Nugget, like many Vegas hotels these days, has gotten smart and ditched the mandatory resort fees that have caused so much negative blowback from travelers, but at the same time has maintained their income streams by charging for Internet access.  It's a ridiculous $13 per 24 hours, which is bad enough, but the charge is also **per device**.  If you are the kind of couple who can't live another minute unless both of your iPads are on the network (thankfully we aren't), plan on dropping $26 a day, which is half of what we paid for the room on a Thursday night. 

But other than those three things, it was fine!

Need a bargain?  $50 a night in the Carson Tower with no resort fee is a Vegas STEAL.  If you've done some research, you're nervous about this recommendation.  Isn't the Carson tower older, you ask?  Yes.  But it's not tacky or dirty.  It's just dated.  But TVs are flatscreen, beds cozy, and the plumbing respectable.  Of course you could upgrade to the Rush Tower, but at $80 a night you're paying strip prices -- and so WHY would you pay strip prices but stay at Freemont?  (Or the Red Rock for that matter.)

Now, suppose you intend to stay at the Carson Tower to save money but cab it to the strip once a day.   Add $40ish a day to do that.  Again, sort of a bad idea, right?

So the only way I'd recommend you staying here is if you had your own car that wasn't a rental.  Then it would add -- what -- $6 in gas a day?  That's not so bad.  Of course now you have the inconvenience of not being able to leisurely drink via a designated cab driver, but maybe that's okay by you too.

So if you follow the advice above, how is the hotel itself?  If you're used to strip mega resorts, the Nugget is refreshingly small.  If you forget something in your room at the Nugget, going back to get it won't take 20 minutes round trip the way it does in most resorts.  Similarly, finding what you need downstairs at the Nugget takes seconds instead of minutes.  Although the decor is kind of dated, it's shiny and 'new' looking.

I've heard awful things about the buffet but there's a great 'diner' inside.   Ten dollars buys you any breakfast you want, which beats most strip buffet breakfasts.  The other restaurants looked decent enough that you wouldn't have to ditch the Nugget for the strip every time hunger hit you.  I tried the Grotto, an uneven Italian spot.  Their pizza was paper thin and sugary tomato sauce... which was odd... because the tomato sauce was significantly better in the pasta dish.  I dined at The Chart House, which was only MEH but then that's all the Chart House has ever really been.  Meh.  There was an amazing aquarium inside this restaurant, but you get a feeling that every time something's a little lame at the Nugget somebody adds swimming fish.

The most over-rated feature of the place was the pool.   Sorry, but it's tiny compared to strip hotels.  In 114 degree weather, that matters.  You don't 'swim' in this pool as much as fight for a space to stand in it and cool off.  People rudely yell and splash as if you're not standing right next to them.  It's a loud obnoxious experience that, for this reviewer, is a deal breaker in summer.  Who gives a crap about sharks in a tank or a waterslide when you can't relax a little in the pool?  That's right:  children.  Oh, and did I mention you'd have better luck finding cheap eats in the Bellagio than a place to sit down in the shade at this pool?  Double deal breaker.

So overall, the Nugget is OK for what and where it is.  But there are so many tricks you have to play to have this make any sense it's just easier to hang on the strip.",2,0,0

The Golden Nugget is at the end of Fremont Street.  Having stayed at numerous downtown hotels, I feel this is the nicest, cleanest, best maintained hotel of all of them.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful.

The hotel has the famous shark tank pool and water slide.  It's small and is does get crowded, but it's an awesome experience.  There is also a jacuzzi, bar and food service.  The second floor pool is adults only and looked very fun.  The resort also had tons of restaurants, bars, gift shops, etc.

As of this writing the parking is free in the garage if you are guest.  Many of the Vegas hotels are starting another trend of nickle and diming their customers by charging them a parking fee, in addition to the resort fee, in additional to the early check in fee, in addition to the late check out fee, in addition to all the Vegas taxes and fees.  Not sure if the Golden Nugget will do the same in the future.  You may want to ask at booking.

We stayed in the Rush Tower Club Level on the 22nd floor.  The room was awesome.  The room was awesome with contemporary decor.  We had excellent views of the strip.  The room also had a large flat screen television with lots of cable channels and PPV, Keurig coffee maker, mini-fring, safe, iron\/board, desk, and large closet.

The nice thing about the Nug, as I've taken to calling it, is it's proximity to the Freemont Experience. It's literally right outside the front door. That made for some good people watching in the evenings. The Deuce bus also stops close by, so it's relatively easy to access the Strip.

The next time I go to Vegas, I either want to stay on the Strip or at a resort nearby.",1,0,0

I also frequent the lake Charles hotel and casino quite often.  I booked a room for my husband and I four months ago for a room with a king size bed.   Upon arrival I was informed my room was not ready and so I stored my luggage at the front desk.   When I was notified that my room was ready, Oliver the assistant manager casually notified us that we were getting a room with two double beds.  I objected because our reservation was for a king size bed.   He unapologetically informed us that there were non available.   When I explained to him I expected compensation for the king size bed that we reserved 4 months ago, he shortly replied, we don't do that.  At this point my husband chimed in because we had witnessed our friends being compensated for a similar situation.   We let him know it was not okay to give us a room with two double beds.  He then said let me see what I can do and he did locate us a king room in a different tower.   For a manager he was very rude and condescending.  I know it is super bowl weekend but we did have reservations.   Also at the bar, the bartender made sure to let us know that you have to bet a minimum of $1 to get comp drinks.   With all that said,  the room is very nice.  Somewhat noisy but very comfortable.  I will think twice about staying here next year.  Not sure if I want to deal with the ""your lucky your here"" attitude.

Update:  After posting this review, upper management contacted me that evening.  She assured me that the customer service that we received was not their standard way of operating.  She was extremely apologetic and let me know that she immediately addressed this issue.  I will continue to frequent The Golden Nugget since this has been addressed.  The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are clean and very comfortable.  Thank you GN for making a bad situation good",0,0,0

We are locals so we love the Vdara, Cosmo feel of a stay-va.

We booked a one bedroom suite that had a living room area. Don't get me wrong it was a huge huge room. For the $250-300 that we paid for that night...they could have given us an upgraded room. Nope. 

I gave it two stars for the size of the room and lots of windows. I wish I could give it a one star.

Embarrassing on top of it another friend couple of ours booked the same ""type"" of room and theirs was the same dark decor....only cleaner.
I just looked on the website and do not see a similar one now, both of our rooms were dark green and dark navy and lots of black marble.
Maybe ours had not been used in a while?

We were not expecting:
-dark dusty room
-old cigar smelling linens
-a room that looked like it had not been booked in months, possibly years
-leather couches that looked old and were ripped
-carpet that was dark and old looking we never wanted to take our shoes off
-chipped tile and dirty grout in the bathroom 
-the room smelled musty 
-it felt like it had been a crime scene or an old house that someone ""aired out"" and deemed acceptable

We stayed in a two-double bed room in the Gold Tower, which just happened to overlook the gorgeous pool. If you're into pools, you absolutely cannot miss this one. The pool area looks like a huge wedding cake cut in half with semi-circular levels with cabanas above the main pool area. The core - seen from the pool level - is a huge aquarium with sharks and large fish. And there's a waterslide that takes you through the aquarium. The pool area didn't get as crazy-busy as some other Vegas hotel pools I've seen, but on hot days it fills up pretty quickly.

The room was fantastic. The hallways were an interesting hodge-podge of smells, a little bit musty and a little bit strawberry lip gloss. Surprising to me was the lack of an ""old hotel"" smell. This place has been renovated with the wallpaper and carpet updated, so inside of the hotel it's tough to imagine how many years the rooms have seen. My only complaint is about the soft beds which led to backaches.

The casino was great, offering free craps lessons most mornings and an excellent array of video slot machines.

stayed in a Carson Tower room with a few friends and all of my basic necessities for a quality hotel room were met. 
The beds were clean, the bathroom was clean, the HDTV actually worked :), and there was hot water. woot!!!

if your staying near the Carson Tower, there's a Starbucks and the gift shop both located right downstairs near the elevators.

the casino is lot more spacious compared to the rest of the casino's on Fremont Street and is clean and the decor is quite charming. it doesn't look like a dump at all!!! The swimming pool that's wrapped around the fish\/shark tank  is beautiful also.
try the italian restaurant Grotto also. it's fabulous

ONE ISSUE that  bothered me is the whole parking situation at the GN.

us "" uh, we haven't checked in yet""
guy in suit "" well you need a hotel key for free parking or we are going to charge you for parking""

alas, we ended stopping by the valet temporarily to check in. Afterwards we came back out and entered the parking garage. The guy in the suit just waved us in as we showed him our room keys.

next afternoon as we check out, we proceed to leave the parking garage. 
lady at the exit asked us where our ticket was.
us "" uh what ticket? we are hotel guests. we are just leaving""
lady ""your supposed to have a ticket stub. I am sorry, I have to charge you for parking in our garage""
us "" wait what!!!, the guy in the suit just waved us in as we entered yesterday.
few minutes later, I finally find my hotel check out invoice and prove to her that we were actual guests.

- Fast, easy, affordable rooms and check-in. 
- Clean rooms.
- With the affordability of the rooms, you can substantially upgrade to a killer suite and still spend less than a standard room on the New Strip. 
- Really affordable food and drinks. 
- Affordable gaming like $5 craps\/roulette (as low as $3 in some places) instead of the $15\/$20+ minimums you see on the New Strip. 
- The Fremont Street experience is great and there is no shortage of things to do all within a max of a 10 minute walk versus the 2 hours it takes to walk from one end of the New Strip to the other.

Their outdoor pool had a cool water slide, which I got on many times, as well as a very nice looking aquarium, which had some big fish as well as some sharks in it!! That was very nice to see. The price for the room was not so bad(I figured rooms at Vegas hotels outside the Strip wouldn't be so pricey anyways!!) The room itself was nice. Small, but very cozy and nice...I mean come, who comes to Vegas to stay the whole time in a small cozy room...the party is outside!! Yes, the casino did reek of cigarettes, but who cares, its Vegas. I personally didn't mind the cigarette stink! The staff was overall friendly with us. Housekeeping was very prompt and well, we got lost trying to find our room, but hey, that is an experience we will always remember. Overall, I loved it here. Highly recommend to anyone looking to pay a cheap price for a nice hotel outside the Strip!!! Rock on dudes!!!",0,0,0

With the upgrade they took us off our private floor with snacks and said they'd send up snacks. So I'm paying $30 for noise and no snacks. No snacks and when we called down about it they said they don't do that.

A group of us (including our 20 month old daughter) arrived Thursday night only to ring out there was an error in their system that was short one room.  Conveniently (for Golden Nugget), they had other rooms available for triple the price paid for other rooms.  When I asked them to match the rate of the other rooms, I was told they could not.

My experience at the Golden Nugget was one I would not wish on my worse enemy.  Also, considering the number of other rooms we had, plus the loyalty my wife's family has shown to this hotel over the years, I was shocked and disappointed by the service we received.

I guess if Golden Nugget feels it's a smarter business move to try and make an extra hundred dollars or so on a room over a few nights at the expense of losing loyal customers, than to do what I think most would consider the ethical\/right move for a business, then that's their prerogative.  With that said, I know that my wife and I, along with my extended family and friends, will never spend a dime at the Golden Nugget, or any of its affiliated properties.

Mr. or Mrs. Golden Nugget please read the reviews of your hotel! I read many of them prior to booking and a common theme appeared; painfully slow check in.

Your hotel is listed as having 2400 rooms, and you had 2 people checking guests in...2! Guess what people waiting in line to check in were complaining about??  This is one of the first impressions a guest has.

Got to the room and had two maintenance issues.  Called the front desk and in less than 15 minutes a maintenance man was knocking on the door. Another 10 minutes or so, and both issues were resolved. Excellent service by the maintenance department!

The room was fine, about what you would expect for the price.  Shower was great, pressure really good and no wait for hot water.

Only ate at two of the  restaurants,  Claim Jumper and Cadillac Mexican Kitchen, both were fine.  The Mexican joint does have a good Happy Hour from 4-7 pm.

Pool - Get to the pool at 8 am when they open the doors to reserve a lounger if you want a specific area or chairs; otherwise, good luck!  

The hotel provides towels, just look for the yellow\/white striped ones in the cart. Put the towel on the lounger you want, with a personal item on it, and it's yours for the day, no charge!

Great service by the waitresses at the pool.  Mixed drinks were $8.50, think beer was $5. Never even get out of your lounger if you don't want to.

Water slide thru the shark tank is free. I did it 3 times and it was a bit of fun.

Pool is great with a large shaded area to get out of the sun for a while. It was 109 degrees the day we were there so the shade came in handy.

Hotel and casino are right on Freemont Street.I enjoy downtown more than The Strip, so The Nugget worked for me.

Didn't play in the  casino but it was very busy every time I walked thru.

Would definitely stay here again, but might ask for a newer section of the hotel.

Checking out of the hotel only took about 5 minutes,  but there were still only 2 people checking guests in, and quite a line of people waiting. Interesting!",7,0,3

The service & staff were friendly and made us feel like we were at home. The rooms were modern and clean (very comfortable beds) and the hotel\/casino common areas were also clean and well maintained. The food was great and the service was even better. Casino staff were professional and attentive with a well organized floor plan, clean, and by far at the top of the downtown casino list. Keno lounge was like sitting in your living room. Beverage service was exceptional.

The air quality could have been better, but with smoking (and I smoke cigars but not in the casino), this is understandable and probably unavoidable.

The covered street fair and rock bands just outside the casino were great free fun between craps and one armed bandit play.

Pool area also had black jack tables. lounge chairs were somewhat crowded together, but we didnt go the LV to lay in the sun, we're from Southern California!

I would recommend the modestly priced additional fee for VIP checkin. The rates were very reasonable for under $60 a night.

-- Our door (as well as all other neighboring doors) slammed HARD
-- The bathroom doesn't come with shampoo\/soap amenities
-- And yes, believe the hype: the Carson Tower is indeed the most rundown of them all.

The casino:
+ Expansive, plenty of space and various 'rooms' or gaming areas
-- Late night tables? The selection is just shady and wrong (i.e. higher limit, variety of games over quantity of dependable games... really, come on now, I am drunk and looking to get my cheap blackjack on... not play an empty $10 Let It Ride table)

The Golden Nugget is a great Hotel, with plenty of restaurants, bars, slots and table came they even have a night club.  The only thing that can get a little rough here is the smoking, it can get really heavy on the casino floor and it can be a disorienting.

They have a great bar right outside on Fremont Street where they have great pricing, awesome bartenders, and the best people watching you have ever seen.

True to point, she did in fact have fun, though this hotel leaves much to be desired! Family friendly not quite....for families there are simply better places to stay. Mostly what you find in the pool are a mass amount of drunks spilling their drinks in the pool. Since they are allowed to have their alcohol in the pool, why not spill it in the water. It's so bad that to counter this, the hotel uses a massive amount of chlorine to treat the pool. The water sadly is clouded\/murky and burns the skin and eyes. Is there a shark tank yes there is....can you go to an aquarium and not swim in booze\/urine\/chlorine yes..yes you can! I would not recommend this place for a family.

The rooms are dated and for the price just go to the main strip. They nickel and dime you for every small amenity, even ones that are free at a Motel 6!!!! I will not be staying here again. There is always a learning curve and I wish I had paid better attention to the reviews prior to booking with them. I stayed in the gold tower which is the nicer tower and still not worth the money.

The hotel is in the older, downtown section of Las Vegas, a ways from the strip.  Our room was in the Gold Tower.  These rooms appear to be recently remodeled.  The room was pretty spacious.  The bathroom is a little small, with only one sink.  But overall, this room was very nice.

The pool area features a large shark tank with a water slide that goes through the tank.  They also have live gaming tables in the pool area.  Obviously, in November the pool was not getting much action.  My only problem with the pool is that is surrounded by the hotel towers and does not get much direct sun.  This may be a blessing during the summer, but won't provide much of an opportunity to get some sun.  There is also a smaller party pool near the Rush tower that has multiple cabanas and a small infinity pool.

The casino is somewhat standard for Vegas, but seemed a bit cramped and smoky.  They may have been managing the number of dealers, but it seemed hard to find a blackjack table with many open seats.  

As opposed to the hotels on the strip that have famous chefs anchoring their hotels, the Nugget has brand-name restaurants, including a Chart House and Claim Jumper.  Neither of these were bad, but it wasn't the dining experience you'd get on the strip.  

The hotel opens to the Fremont Street experience.  The street has a cover that allows projection of video and periodic shows. They also have a zip line. But the real show is the street entertainers trying to earn a buck.  It is worth grabbing a drink and walking (which is legal) up and down Fremont just to take it all in.

Now, I'm a vintagegirl and I prefer the old downtown Vegas to the strip. 
Seems to me though that this is catching on. 
There's more and more people starting to prefer Fremont St. and the charm of vintage Las Vegas. 
Got a good deal online staying at the new Rush Tower. Nice rooms. We came in on a Sunday morning and had the Sunday champagne brunch! Fantastic! 
Comfy bed, quiet and blackout curtains. 
The tv channels leave a bit to be desired. No HBO or special channels. Guess they want you to spend your time in their casino. 
The only noises we heard were the chatty maids in the morning.  If you don't want them coming into your room at 8am, be sure to hang your ""Privacy please"" sign on your door!!
Toilet paper is bargain brand and not Charmin soft!! Just a warning... 
Don't ask for a fridge. It'll cost you $20 a day.  Tip: Bring an ice chest and have snacks. There's an ice machine on every level. (And it'll save you $ on food and hooch and eating out) ;)
Wanna use the fitness center? Also, $20 a day. Unless, you get a spa treatment, which  I highly recommend. I got a mini massage, facial and pedicure. Cost me $200 and tip is included. I must have spent 4 hours using the gym, facilities and having my treatments. There was cucumber water, snacks, water, juice. The royal treatment!
One more thing: the coffee in your room is not complimentary and neither is the water! A bottle of Dasani water will cost you $7 and the Kuerig coffee pods will cost you $10 if you open the box! 
Tip: buy your coffee pods at Target or bring them from home.

This hotel is supposed to be a four star hotel, but it's really a three star in my eyes.  The beds are pretty uncomfortable, and the mattress pad they have on my bed doesn't even fit the bed.  Further, they have just a flat sheet on top of the mattress pad rather than a fitted sheet, and when I called housekeeping, I was told they didn't have any fitted sheets.  Sounds really anal, I'm sure, but the sheet kept coming off the bed overnight.

The A\/C is loud, and the plasma TV doesn't have any HDMI inputs so I can hook up my laptop, which seems like a really sad angle to make you buy their movies.  There's also no outlets near the bed, which is really annoying.  Again, just not what I expect from a 4 star hotel.

The hotel room was big and the bed was comfortable and there was a large, flat screen tv. The bathroom was small and the door was too close to the toilet so if you had to shut the door while you are conducting business or  ""dropping the kids off"" you have to do a breakdance ass move to shut it resulting in Indian burn on the butt cheeks. Good times:)

The restaurants: I am now a HUGE fan of the Italian restaurant, Grotto. It's not very romantic, but everything I tasted from the bread with a garlic infused oil dip, to the homemade sausage rigatoni to the angel food cake dessert was highly enjoyable. Our waitress with short, blonde hair was on point and knew the menu inside and out.  Also the coffee shop was cool. Decent food, shitty coffee. It still didn't stop me from sucking down four cups a day. The last morning my waitress was a Bee when I told her that we would like to charge it to the room. She said she tried twice and it didn't work. Then she got a huge tude and said she would try a third time. What do ya' know? It effin worked! Of course it did because I have been staying here for two nights! What a Bee.....
 
The Pool- Biggest disappointment I have had in months. My whole life everyone has raved about the GN Pool and I always felt as if I was missing out. NOT. The chairs are pushed together like a mass grave to the point your neighbor's back hair eskimo kisses you when he turns over. The water looks like Jenna Jameson's mouth after one of her movies before they hand her the spit bucket. I'm being serious. Sure there is a slide and a shark tank, but none of which did anything for me. We were both over 21 and for some reason I was never told we could go to the adult pool which I am sure was the exact opposite of this nonsense. FAIL. 

The Spa- Since the pool sucked shlong we ventured to the spa for treatments. Best move. I got quiet, alone time full of rubbing and aroma therapy and soothing music and this turned out to be the absolute highlight. Good job GN. 

Overall I don't think I would stay at the GN again. Well, maybe. If only to get buzzed and watch the Homeless Drug Addict Soul Train Dance Contest outside. If you don't know what I am talking about you need to go Downtown tonight and witness this shit. You will never be more embarrassed for this city.

However, we were very disappointed. Our stay started when half our party arrived and the system had crashed. The front desk told them they had no reservations saved from this and they were able to check them in because they were there - other reservations could not be held. Thankfully they allowed them to check us into our room, because when we did arrive the hotel was booked and we would not have been given a room. Prior to our trip we called twice to request rooms on the same floor and this did not happen (one on 11 and the other on the 19th). They did tell us we could switch rooms in the AM and to call down and we could move. We called down in the AM and the front desk told us the room was empty and needed cleaning but would check us into the room and when we came back into the hotel to pick up keys. We did exactly that and there was no record of our new room and there were no open rooms on the 11th floor. They thankfully never checked us out of our 19th floor room.

Also, wifi was $13 a day and coffee, a bottle of Figi water for $7 and 4 Kcups for $10. What a rip!

We enjoy the pool with the shark tank, truly a unique experience, the quality restaurants, which give us points on our Landry's select card, and the entertainment on Fremont. On this trip we stayed in the Rush Tower on the 20th floor. The room was newly remodeled, clean, and very nice. The only negative on the room is that it faced Fremont St and even on the 20th floor was rather noisy. During the trip we relaxed, had some good meals, and enjoyed a day bed rental at the H2O pool. The negatives of the trip- we were told that our food and booze purchases at the H2O pool would gain us Landry's points and to take our receipts to the front desk.  At the front desk we were told we could not get the points. Disappointing but okay. The resort fees have continued to increase and are higher than many of the resorts on the strip and can easily add 20-40% to the price of your room depending on room selection.  What truly frustrates me though is a $10 dollar charge on my credit card from them and of course no one can explain it to me except account receivables which is only open limited hours during the week.

They have a prime location in somewhat the middle of the Fremont strip. Majority of the guests are middle aged and retired. I don't think I saw many people in our age group while staying there. I didn't spend much time in the casino because I couldn't stand the smoke smell.

The pool is the best part of the hotel with a shark tank in the middle and multiple bars on multiple floors. They also have a grill on the first floor that serves your standard burgers, fries and nachos. Food was A-OK. It was a shame that the weather was windy and a little rainy (totally mind-blowing for Vegas) so they had to close the pool for a couple of days in the middle of our stay.
 
They also have a couple of restaurants in the hotel, one of which is Claim Jumper. We didn't get to dine there but they prepare the food for room service orders so I did get to try their massive chicken pot pie which was yummy and the crust was nice and buttery.

The fitness center and spa are located in a separate tower on the same floor. Their fitness center is disjointed with weights in one room and cardio machines in another. They offer the standard amenities like towels, fruit and fruit infused water. There are a few retail stores near the lobby and a souvenir shop upstairs. 

Customer service was pretty good. The valet team was quick and friendly. The check-in staff was also quick and friendly and the housekeepers were nice and thorough. However, they have a short driveway so they would get backed up at times, especially at night.

Overall, a decent hotel to stay at but I doubt we'll be back-mainly because of the poor ventilation and outdated facility. However, if you're looking for a great rate this would be one of the hotels to look into.

Then I realized that a stay here is pretty much the equivalent to being on a cruise ship on dry land, and that got me into the right mindset in advance, especially in terms of services, additional charges, etc.. This appears to be one of the better hotels on Fremont St., and that showed in the overall quality and service here. 

The staff here were professional and about what I expected. We did get exceptional help from the bellhops and from the doormen in front when it came time to get transportation back to the airport.

We had rooms in the Carson tower which were reasonable. The beds were comfortable. I had a great view of a boxing match going on next door from my window on Saturday night.

With so many food options along Fremont Street, we only dined in the hotel twice. I recommend the breakfast buffet, especially on weekdays (it's $4 more on weekends). You get your money's worth.

The casinos are among the higher-end in the area as well, and very professional. Unfortunately, that also means higher minimum bets at many tables, if that's important to you. 

The tube slide through the shark (and tuna) shark tank is cool, but you really can't see to much while you're going through it.

One bizarre incident - there was a minor earthquake here during my stay, and I happened to be in an elevator when it occurred. It was not pleasant, the elevator did drop a little before it recovered.

You can get a room here for less than $75 a night (usually), at that rate it would be the choice of downtown.

Nice room but a bit cramped. There was a Flat panel TV for watching football games (when the sportsbooks were too crowded) No ESPN2 though.

The Tank

The pool area ""the TANK"" was fun, the heavier you are the faster you go down the slide. My daughter tips the scales at 100 pounds came out at about 2 mph, myself at 260 got the lifeguard wet.

The Buffet

Had breakfast on a Monday at the ""The buffet"", for $9.99 they could of done better. I wouldn't recommend it because it was just ok and the service was terrible. When you pay the cashier they take your drink orders, so the first time you see your waiter, he's bringing out all the drinks for his section on a round tray. He must of had 10 OJ's 6 coffee's and 4 cranberry juices on his tray. I wanted to get some water for my mother in law and he just brushed me off. I got the water about 10 minutes later when he was bringing out more drinks for his section.

I love the pool with the water slide, shark tank, and the Dive Bar bar. The casino isn't a cheap-o dump, but it's not the cheapest, either. I love the giant slot machine at the entrance. 

Here's a quick review of the restaurants. 

Red Sushi: Excellent, excellent staff and cool location. The rice was all wrong, though. Too sticky for sushi rice. Aside from that my meal was delightful. Again, great staff. 

The Buffet: One of the better buffets I've been to at this level of casino. It's not five-stars, but it's good for the price. Be sure to use the coupon in the coupon book found in your room! 

Carson Street: The food wasn't that great, but they sat us near the walk way and we got to people watch and we could see the sharks in the pool from our seat, so that was nice. 

I would've given the Golden Nugget five stars except for the fact that at least SEVEN TIMES my boyfriend and I were accosted by staff members trying to get us on one of those God damned time share tours. We politely declined the first three times, but after being hounded by the SAME employees we just changed our refusal to yelling ""no timeshares!"" while running away covering our face. Whether we were just walking into the hotel\/casino, or if we were asking directions, they were trying to get us to waste 4-5 hours of our day listening to a sales pitch for something we didn't want and couldn't afford. I'm guessing this is how they got the money for the remodeling, but it really cheapened the experience. I felt like I only got a nice deal because I had to deal with this constant salesmen harassment. 

But don't get me wrong. I do love the Golden Nugget and I will stay there again the next time I go to Vegas (I go about every two years).",1,0,1

We were never told about construction on room down the hall. You could hear drills, hammering etc..... In morning. We were not accomodated at all after it being mentioned at front desk. I really liked staying on the old side. Everything is much closer together, more reasonable prices, compared to newer side. Fremont street experience was defenetly an experience.

That doesn't include the wait standing in line to check in. At no time during check-in was I told that the pool closed or that the arcade\/game room were closed. Those were the 2 reasons I choose the Golden Nugget. We could have stayed somewhere else on Fremont Street for less! The arcade entrance was taped\/ coned off. The roof was leaking and the ceiling lights were still on! A complete safety hazard not to mention a law suit waiting to happen. Our room was your typical room... Nice. The only issue was the carpet inside our room and hall outside our room looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in weeks. Also, cable channels sucked. One bright spot (the only reason I gave them 1star) was the Asian Cuisine restaurant. The food was delicious and staff was fun, entertaining.

That said, Ive stayed in a lot of hotels globally, so I'm writing from that POV...

To put it simply, if you are going to stay in old Vegas (downtown) then here is really your only choice. Sure you could try the Fitzgerald or one of the other hotels... This is the only one that comes close to having that mix of 21st century Vegas ""property"" feel you find on the strip mixed with the seediness of old neon on Fremont. Everything else looked kind of tragic and cheap in comparison. 

I found most of the service to be solid, the front desk treated me and mine with respect and courtesy and the room was clean and fresh smelling.

The only real rudeness I found was out at the pool. On Saturday, a bunch of us are chillin in front of a cabana, and none of the hostesses say its a problem... mustve been cuz of the breezy weather. Next day, some little pixie (can pixies be non-white? This one was) rudely tells me to leave ""in case this cabana was rented"". Insert expletive here. 

Aside from that unpleasantness, everything else about the Nugget was A-OK. I went to the spa twice to get a steam and a workout... very nice for the mens up in there. One very cute guy kept checking on me in the steam room. Had I been single i would've asked him what time he got off...

The buffet blows, but thats to be expected. We only ate there since we were headed out to Hoover Dam and needed a quick fix. Its like Jack Colton says: it seems like someone snuck into the kitchen and sucked out 40% of the flavor at these things. Hence why I don't frequent. And to the big people out there, dont be caught in a buffet its not healthy! 

Overall I found my 5 day stay at the Nugget quite nice, and a good deal. Would I stay again? Perhaps, if the price is right and after I've checked out some of the other ""properties"".",0,0,0

 The only complaints we had were a total lack of signage on where to check in, which resulted in us having to go to two different check in lines at 1 AM, and the disconnect between them and the parking garage. They told us we didn't need our parking ticket to leave the garage without paying, only our room key; when we showed our room key, they informed us we would need the parking ticket, or we would have to pay $12.

I decided to go Golden Nugget because we were coming to watch the Pacquaio vs Mayweather fight and those tickets were already $3k each, ie time to save some money on the hotel LOL.

Golden Nugget actually backs Freemont Street so you can just walk out of the casino and bam, you are right in the middle of all the festivities.  Room rates are pretty cheap here, but if you want to stay in the nice updated rooms its going to bump up cost to about what staying at the Luxor would be.  That being said the normal rooms are certainly not fancy, but they get the job done.  

The pool area is probably the highlight of GN with a huge aquarium in the center which includes a see through slide tube that shoots right through the center of the aquarium giving you a horrifying glimpse of sharks and other large fish as you splash on by.  There is also a bar in the pool and table games surrounding the pool area complete with bikini clad dealers.

There are lots of places to eat and drink inside the GN as well as a few shops.  The casino area was nice and we especially enjoyed the ""no commission"" Fortune Pai Gow tables.  In general all of the downtown casinos are favorable versus casinos on the strip.  There is no resort fee downtown, but there is a small $4 or so downtown renovation fee.  Wifi is not included but it is available for a fee.

Now, if you are planning on traveling to the strip often, you need a rental car.  Taxi rides are around $25 not including tip so if you don't want to rent a car you should probably stay on the strip itself.   If you don't mind the cab fare and want to try something different give GN a try.

I booked a suite here because I wanted to take my son to their pool ...the ""suite"" is a joke, especially for Vegas standards. It is literally just two regular rooms, adjoined by a door, except one room is missing the bed and they call that a livingroom. No wonder I couldn't find any photos of their suites. Didn't have a choice but to stay here for one night but you can bet I canceled the rest! The lobby is literally riddled with crackheads and degenerates. 

I guess this is why people don't stay in downtown Las Vegas.


The next morning, we decided to make the best of things and still go to the pool...  Well, we got there at 10am and there was NO WHERE to sit, and an obscene amount of people. The pool is tiny, and looked no where as cool as it does online.

I had to go back to the front desk, where the agent had to confer with the front desk manager before crediting out the additional charge.  ugh.  service seems to really be going downhill at this place, which is sad.

If you are a female and plan on coming here with your girls beware of your surroundings! My friend and I were harassed by homeless? Guys begging us for money while we were playing at a slot machine. When we told him we did not have any money he pointed to our screen and said ""you have $80"" and proceeded to insist we cash out and give him money. We told him ""no"", waited and cashed out and left very uncomfortable as we were walking away 2 other guys (possibly with the first) started to follow us.

We paid extra to get a room with a view when we booked the room online at their website. Upon arrival on a Thursday evening we were told rooms with a view were sold out. She said it was first come first served. The view from our window was a wall. She said she upgraded us to a mini suite for the inconvenience but the only difference between a regular room and a mini suite is that the tub has jets. Our friends who came with us paid $60 less and had a gorgeous view out their window and they arrived hours after we did. First come first served?  Whatever.  The second reason is the lack of lounge chairs at the pool. If you don't get there right when the pool opens or pay money to reserve a seat in advance you're pretty much out of luck.

Our kids are dolphins and because we personally don't have a pool in our backyard...we like to play tourist and take the kids on a swimming trip. While I love just hanging around the golden nugget, especially their pool, the last time we stayed there the bed sucked and I kept itching! No bed bug bites...but I was itchy. Usually when I get itchy something must've been dusty or moldy. I'm thinking the bedding wasn't changed but merely dusted off and fixed. How do I know? HAIRS. not haiR, but hairS. I didn't say anything and ended up sleeping on the second layer. The bed gave me bodyaches. 

I was disappointed because that wasn't the norm for our usual golden nugget stays. Then I realized the towers actually had names...I think we stayed in the Carson towers as they are the rooms that have the cheaper rates.

None-the-less, my children love swimming and staring at the fish tank...sliding down their slide...and just being able to swim, period. They have a part of their pool where there are built in lounge chairs where you can just chill partial in the water. This area is best especially if you have toddlers. I also like that I don't have to be around obnoxious woo-hoo we are in Vegas and are children free type of folks. Golden nugget typically attracts middle aged people. Besides, all the wild ones prefer to be ON the strip.

They have ample.parking that isn't connected to the hotel rather adjacent to ot. Elevator ride and a quick walk across and you have arrived. 

I can't say I HIGHLY recommend to stay at the golden nugget considering a lot of hotels in the vicinity have emerged...but, I certainly won't say not to. To each it's own. I believe it's the rush tower that has a beautiful aquarium at its check-in. Overall, we have had positive experiences aside from the last visit.

I liked what I saw online (pics and video of the nice rooms and good square footage). I called a few hours ago to make my reservation. I was going to do the basic room (CARSON TOWER DELUXE) which was going to cost me $215 for 3 days in June, pretty good deal! But when I told the rep on the phone that I was celebrating my birthday, she told me about the much nicer and newly remodeled Rush Tower, and thought I might enjoy my stay there better. Much larger rooms, and when I looked at the room online, I loved the modern feel of the place. I agreed, even though it was about $100 more than the first room I was going to stay in. So my new total was going to be (with my AAA discount) $303.30 + tax she quoted me $312.39 (NEW RUSH TOWER DELUXE), figured I'd splurge a little more and waste an extra $100 on something a little nicer to treat myself. (I should have been concerned when she kept asking me to hold on cause she was having ""computer problems"" when I was confirming pricing with her. Maybe she didnt know how to add.)
A few hours later I get an email confirmation stating I was going to be charged $342.73 (over $30 more than what she quoted me!) What the hell!? So I call back, talk to another rep and tell her I'm being overcharged. She rudely cut me off a few times and told me the lady must have calculated the tax wrong cause they're going to charge me the $342.73. This is almost $130 more than what I originally wanted to spend. For that price I can stay at Luxor (where I usually stay, but wanted to try something different!), AND get the spa suite at that price, with a hot tub in my room and a separate living room area too. So disappointing. Was really excited about staying here. Now I have to wait 1-2 weeks to get my $161 deposit back.

The problem is that my husband and I tried to get into the pool area Friday, Saturday & Sunday, but could not get a place to sit because when people have their towels on the chaise lounge it means its taken, even if they are nowhere to be found.  Three huge towers of hotel guests but not nearly enough pool area.  OK so we decide to come back in the evening thinking it would be less full.  The pool closes at 6pm.  Are you kidding??  The resort fee, we were told also included a gym that did not have enough machines so people either stood around or left.   

People smoke EVERYWHERE and it reeks so if you are a non-smoker and it bothers you, beware.  Our friends asked for a non-smoking room but had to change it due to the heavy smoke smell.   Many of the restaurants are connected to a bar area so smoking is wafting in from cigarettes and cigars.  The ceilings are lower than those in the newer casinos so I could not stay to gamble because the smoke smell was so bad.  No slot areas are designated non-smoking, though I hear they have a non-smoking area for poker tables.

The noise from the street area is ridiculous and goes on well into the night on weekends.  So forget sleeping because in some of the rooms, it sounds like there is a party next to your bed. 

I gave it two stars because the staff is very nice and were sympathetic.  They basically said the pool is a ""first come first serve"" and only charged us a resort fee for one night.  Also, the rooms are very nice and clean, though we had to call at 4pm to get ours cleaned to find out our maid did not come in that day  : \/        They finally sent someone else.

Our upgraded Rush Tower room ended up being the NICEST place we stayed all week. First off, the renovations in the main hotel\/casino areas are really great.

POOL: My boyfriend and I are 23 and we absolutely loved the Golden Nugget's pools, both the shark tank (main pool area), and the Hideout on the third level. The water slide is very fun, and being in the water and watching the fish and sharks in the tank is beyond neat. There seemed to be people of all ages around, families included. I would recommend getting there by 9:30-10AM Friday-Sunday if you want to guarantee your choice of lounge chairs (or get a seat at all). Hint: if you don't want to be around children, hang out in the Adult Sunbathing (topless) area on the third level -- that's where we spent both Friday and Saturday and it couldn't have been more relaxing. The Hideout Pool is right around the corner from that area on the top level and you don't have to buy a $10 lounge chair in order to enjoy the pool. For all of the pools, they do check for room keys upon entering, so make sure you have yours! I would also recommend foregoing the bar in the Golden Nugget's pool area and instead walking to Fremont Street, which is extremely close, for $1 margaritas and cheaper food.

The pool is something that most definitely stands out. Not only because it's one of the few pools in the Old Town, but because it too was renovated and it has some exciting new features. To begin- Poolside Gambling- not a novel concept, but pretty sweet non-the-less; lounge chairs in the shallow waters of the pool- again not novel, but still pretty wonderful; and finally- an aquarium in the middle of the pool. Yep- that's right- I said aquarium. Complete with sharks and large fish the aquarium is seamlessly designed to sit in the center of the pool, and looks to be part of where you are swimming. To top that off- there is a water slide directly through the center of the aquarium that shoots you back out into the pool. Another bonus- if you're not staying in the hotel you can get a day pass for only $20, and it's well worth it.

We were on the 12th floor with a view of the pool.  The room was very comfortable but the shower doors should be replaced with a curtain.  It is so awkward that opens to the same space that the bathroom door opens.  It's also awkward getting the shower turned on and comfortable.

The one major complaint I have is their charges for wi-fi of $12.99\/24 hours.  I understand they want you down in the casino and not hanging out in your room but that's exorbitant.  I don't go to Vegas to hang out in my room but I'd still like to get online securely and safely to check on a variety of things.

But it's a great spot and definitely worth visiting!",5,4,4

Quick shout out to some of the best of the best:  Floor: Vito, Dealers: Marlon, Pete, Toni, and many, many others, and Server: Elizabeth.

And the not-so-good - the hotel itself.  

Day 1:
Check in was nothing unusual for Vegas.  The customer service agent (guy) was not anything I'd consider friendly or overly helpful.  80% businesslike, 20% arrogant douchebag.  

We were in the Carson tower, which is about a mile or so away from Fremont street.  I didn't really care, because I really could use the walking after playing cards all day.  We located our room, which turned out to be the furthest possible room from the elevator, roughly 200 yards away (no exaggeration).  Housekeeping was in the room, and told us they shouldn't have checked us in, and that we'd have to go back downstairs and get another room.  Annoying, given that we had just lugged all of our shit up there.  

The next agent (female) was much friendlier and apologetic, fixed the problem right away, and got us a different room.  The room was nice, but nothing to write home about.  It was dated, the air from the A\/C unit smelled a little musty, and my wife smelled smoke in the room (even though it was a non-smoking room).  I wasn't really in the mood to make yet another trip down, so we just sucked it up.  

Day 2:
My wife was determined to hit the pool.  After all, it is one of the highlights of the hotel, right?  We went down about 9:45, knowing the pool deck was open, but you couldn't swim until 10.  It was going to be another 115-degree or so day, so I was really looking forward to the pool as well.  

There weren't any chairs available.  There were plenty of chairs there with nobody in them, but some article ""reserving"" them.  One sandal on one chair, its matching sandal on the chair next to it.  A pair of sunglasses.  An empty bottle of water.  

We went up to the security person, who apologized and said that although people aren't supposed to reserve chairs, they just leave stuff there all the time and come back whenever.  She said they try to enforce the policy, and has told management that people abuse it all the time, but they don't listen to her.  With no chairs available, we left disappointed.   
 
When we returned to our room, it was open.  Not open all the way, but it was resting on the latch.  All of our stuff was in there, so I was more than a little concerned.  I walked down the hall and asked the housekeeper if she had been in our room, and she said no.  The housekeeper told me that ""lots of people have keys to these rooms"" and I should call down to security, so I called security.  They said they'd investigate and get back to me.  That was around 10:30 a.m.   I called back about a half-hour later, and ""John"" told me that a housekeeping key was used, and they were investigating.  They'd get back to me.  I gave up at around 11:30 and went to eat.  I eventually found out it was someone on the housekeeping staff that had done a room check - only because I kept on it.  If I had waited for the GN staff to call me back, I'd still be waiting.

My wife then told me that she wished we had stayed at the D again.  I agreed.

Day 3:
Pool deck.  Chairs.  Sun.  
And then the pool opened. 
There are around 500 reasons we don't have kids, and they were all there at 10:00.  In addition, the water was cloudy enough that we couldn't see the bottom step, and both my wife and I slammed our toes into it trying to get out of the pool.  Ugh.  

There is an upstairs (16 and over) pool, as we learned.  It has clear water, quiet, and none of the problems above. But since they were sold out of lounge chairs (everything costs money, and you can't go in for free before 5pm), I was stuck in Disneyland hell below. I gave up eventually and went into the casino for some peace and quiet.  

Day 4:
Upstairs pool, nice.  Poker, nice.  Buffet, nice.  Good day!

Day 5:
Check out.
Although they told us we weren't going to be charged the ""Fremont Experience Fee,"" (we checked in under the wire), it showed up anyway.  So, I called down to have it taken off, and they apologized for me misunderstanding the check-in agent (which pissed me off a little bit, since both my wife and I heard him clearly). 

And the coup-de-grace?  
I hand our valet ticket in and wait.  And wait.  And wait.  
Eventually the valet calls me over to the desk and admits that they can't locate our keys.  He asks me if the name is correct, and what color the ticket is.  He dutifully goes through every envelope in the drawer.  Eventually, he locates it and gets our car.  I figured it would have been a fitting ending to our stay if they had lost it or given it to someone else.   

Verdict:
There are many things I love about the GN.  The hotel isn't one of them.

I'll continue to play cards there and eat there.  But stay there?  Probably not anytime soon.",17,4,2

Not too firm, not too soft. I think the pillowtop makes all the difference. The bathroom is roomy, not as cramped as some others I've been in, but the tub is very utilitarian. Get in, wash up, get out. There's no laying back and relaxing in this one.

The staff is mostly pleasant and attends to needs fairly quickly. The longest I had to wait for anything was when I discovered the drain plug was missing in the tub, and they had to go find a new one. That took about an hour. Otherwise, quick to address issues. The only problem we had was that we were guaranteed a late check-in, but they gave away our smoking room for the first night. We had to switch to a non-smoking room for the first night, and then check-out and check-in again on Day 2.

The hot tub is great, and it wasn't very crowded when I went down in the evenings. The pool, however, could be better. Over the course of my stay, I realized it's best to watch the good chairs. Most people assume a chair is taken when there are towels laid out on it, but I found that half the time, they aren't. Keep an eye out, and you'll find a decent spot. Now, for the pool itself. The slide and shark tank are very cool, and I enjoyed those. But I look for a pool where you can really swim. This one is not very ideal. This is a float around for a few minutes or just stand in the water to cool off pool. The shallow depth doesn't make it very ideal for swimming, and because so many people are just standing around in the water, it can be hard to move around. Another tip: If you want to actively swim, go on the shady side. People over there are mostly just standing close to the tank to see the fish. There's much more room to maneuver.

Also, I have to say, the dealers at the pool-side tables were very friendly and much more patient than in the casino, where it's busier. I played craps for the first time and had a lot of fun winning!

Our room was nice, a little worn feeling but the bed was comfy. The Golden Nugget goes for more of the glitzy\/opulent vibe while we are more fans of modern\/clean\/simplistic, but we could appreciate the decorations for what they were. Terrible tv channel offerings, but I suppose most people are out gambling and boozing it up and aren't like boring old us, who were in bed by 10pm.

The gambling minimums start at $10\/hand, where as all of the other casinos within walking distance start at $5. 
We didn't eat here during our stay because none of the restaurants looked appetizing. One restaurant was always full of people with empty tables. Every time we walked past, we noted how no one was ever eating, just waiting.

The location is great since it's walking distance to the festival. I was a little weary of this hotel since there's some questionable photos of the property that are, quite frankly, downright disgusting.  Some of these reviews really had me worried.  I am happy to say that I did not encounter any of the horrible things I've read about this hotel.

Check in:
Especially during busy seasons, check in early! The lines do get quite long! Luckily, we checked in around 9am before we can get our room. The good thing is, you can leave your luggage at the front desk and they will text or call you as soon as your room is ready. Normal check-in time is 3pm, but our room was ready around 2pm. Front desk was very pleasant and helpful.

Room:
Rush Tower is their most updated tower. I heard the Carson tower isn't upgraded, therefore, it is cheaper. If you booked a different tower, you can always ask the front desk to upgrade you with an upgrade fee. (I've heard you can tip the front desk to get a free upgrade, but I'm not about that life). I'm so glad we upgraded because the room was very nice! Very spacious, comfy bed, big bathroom, and clean. Considering it's one of the older hotels, this room is comparable to other major hotels on the Strip. Rush Tower is the way to go! 

Pool:
I was so excited about the pool here! They have a fish tank in the middle of the pool! And a slide that goes between it! This was the main reason why we booked here this past trip. I'm deducting a star because I was very disappointed once we actually got into the pool area. The main reason being that all the pool chairs are stacked up right next to each other. I do not wish to be that close and personal with other pool goers! I understand they're trying to accommodate as many people as possible, but it was ridiculous. It was very uncomfortable and awkward to be so up close and personal in everyone's business. We didn't end up staying very long at all. Very sad.

Overall, it was a great stay. Maybe next time, I'll actually get to check out the pool when it's not so packed!",13,0,3

Room - First, let me start out by saying that when we arrived to check in at (4pm)  they didn't have the room type we wanted and said that we would need to change rooms the next day.  They put us in a crappy 3rd floor room with a view of the roof and of the parking garage across the street.  There was some sort of vent on the roof that would whir at intervals that we could hear clearly in the room.  The next day we were moved to the 18th floor to a room that was in the furthest-most-far-away corner from the elevators.  It had a nicer view and a big flatscreen tv (the other room had an older smaller one) and no whirring noise.  However the trade off is that they were doing construction a few floors above us and would start scraping and pounding hammers at 8am.  We got to enjoy that for 2 nights.

Food - We ate at the cafe.  It was totally average.  I had to send my salad back because it was nasty (think of a bagged salad that has started showing signs that it needs to be thrown out).  They did replace it with much better lettuce but it was still just blah.   The breakfast\/lunch buffet (we arrive there right as they were switching for lunch) was good.  It was a decent variety of food and some good desserts.

I can't really rate the casino because we were really not impressed by the GN so we weren't inclined to spend our money there.

Overall, I probably won't be staying there again!

Pros:
- Pool!  Terrific pool (the main reason we stayed there) with great music (though the DJ could have given a bit more variety).  The fish are awesome, and the sharks are downright distracting.  You are in the pool, and they go casually swimming by in the tank.  Really impressive.  There are a couple of sharks that have razor-like teeth sticking out, and with their sinister-looking eyes, they grab your attention.    
- Rooms are nice, but need more electrical outlets for all the cell phones, iPads, etc. 
- Free parking
- Starbucks in the lobby (of course you have to pay for it)
- Nice dining area.  All the restaurants are updated, contemporary, modern, and competitive.  If at dinner time you walk down the main corridor where the restaurants are, the terrific smells will make you hungry.  
- Drinks at pool:  Pricing was less than I expected, and less than the awful Serendipity 3.  I think I paid $7 for a bourbon & water.  Not bad considering it was pool-side service. Note:  Bring your ID if you want to charge to your room!   You can also get a small bucket of beer 6 for the price of 5, including ice.  This was popular at the pool.  

Cons:
- No in-room free coffee?!  This is the first hotel I have stayed in in more than 15 years that didn't give free coffee in the room.  Wow!  That is very CHEAP of the Golden Nugget.  
- No free WiFi.  If you want to connect it is $13 \/ day.  Seriously?!  
- Lots of smokers walking around and in the casino, too.  Though, that seems to be the same all over the Strip casinos I visited.  I could smell the smoke in my clothes.  
- Clearance in parking deck:  It is LOW!  If you drive a big SUV, then you can't have anything on the roof at all!  
- TV service in the room:  I think the hotel needs to update its wiring.   Our TV suffered from lagging and pixilation.  From past experience this indicates too much content trying to go across old wiring.",2,0,0

Secret tip for you here: the rooms are discounted in the Carson tower but they're just like those in the Gold tower, except that they're further away and thus avoid much of the crowd crush on when the hotel is busy.

  We were so exhausted we called down to the front desk and after 30 minutes of recorded overly cheerful advertisements of how you can spend your money in every part of their hotel, casinos and cafe's, someone finally answers and says she will send up some earplugs.  After waiting another 40 minutes in the din of robot construction, a fellow comes to the door and hands me one pair of earplugs, I can see another pair in his hands and say there are two of us here and we need two pair, he wont budge, ""sorry these are for another room,I will have to come back and give you some more"".  So we wait.
   Hours later, four times on the phone and an attack of hysterics brought on by lack of sleep, overstimulation and NOISE we finally get a second pair of earplugs and get to sleep about three oclock.  By six AM the sound of twenty construction vehicles with their reverse beepers on, cut through the thick earplugs, it was like trying to sleep through twenty alarm clocks going off.

  It was so difficult to actually get through to the front desk, I wonder what would happen if there was a big problem, like a security issue.
 Apparently the construction will be going on for some time, this noise probably impacts the other hotels in the downtown area. I am suprised that people can do construction 24 hours a day there.
  The area is getting better,and the Gold Nugget is the nicest in the area, but there is still an element of sleazy people hanging around, so I would probably feel safer on the strip.
 I would review the casino, but i dont really dig gambling, I would much rather spend my 3 dollars on gold 60's shoes with lucite heels,like I did at the local Goodwill.

Our room was really very spacious and nicely decorated.  The view from the 20th floor was pretty cool, especially at night.  Also, there was a large tub, nice shower head, and it was very clean.  
I did not like some things about the hotel.  The $28 per night ""resort fee"" was supposed to include two bottles of water per night, internet, and pool use, but the pool was closed and they didn't bring water.  However, when I called they did arrive right away with the water.
The housekeeping did a good job, but I guess the hotel does not communicate with them too well, as we had housekeepers knocking at our door to ask if we were leaving, despite our request for a late check out.  I  also did not like that they charge $10 for the cups for the Keurig.
As far as amenities, the hotel is not bad.  As I said, the pool was closed (not sure if was due to the season or remodeling), so I cannot comment.  They have a few restaurants and two Starbucks (which is nice when you don't want to pay for the Keurig).  
We spent some time in the Chart house cocktail bar so we could be mesmerized by the amazing fish tank.
Though our room smelled clean, the casino in the hotel was one of the smokier ones I've stayed in.  

All in all, it was a decent hotel, but nothing amazing.",4,1,2

I got the cheapest room for the night and it was still one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed at.  The beds were comfy and the room beautifully decorated.  The closet contained two bathrobes, luggage rack, extra pillow, iron and board, and an easy to use safe.  I liked that there was a little vanity outside the bedroom so I didn't have to crowd the bathroom to put on my make-up.  

I think the best thing about this place is the pool.  Sure it's small and getting a lounge chair might be a fight to the death when it gets busy, but it is so fun.  Also if you don't know, the free towels are in the retail shop.  I was suprised to find it was a salt water pool.  There is a shark tank smack in the middle of the pool, and in the middle of the tank is an awsome water slide.  I was suprised to find an elevator to the third floor to get on the water slide, so fat asses like myself don't have to huff and puff up three flights of stairs to have a bit of fun.  At the end your going fast enough to go under, so be prepared.  Salt water up your nose, hurts so good.

The following day, Saturday, we decided to go check out the Red Rock Hotel.  We left our room at approx. 10:00 am and placed the privacy please sign on the door. We were out of the room until approx. 5:00pm. During that time my jewelry box was stolen. When I contacted the security dept. a gentleman came to our room and took a report in a very small piece of paper that didn't appear to be very official. He did explain that Loss Prevention would be in contact with us in 5-7 days. When we contacted the Loss Prevention Dept. later the following week he informed us that according to their records there had been some activity in our room while we were away. I asked why someone would enter our room when the privacy please sign was hanging on the door. The gentleman I spoke with told me that someone could have removed the sign while passing by and we had no proof that the sign was there. I explained that when my husband and I returned to the room that evening the sign was still on the door. He told me that the person who entered the room had a ""stellar"" reputation and was a long time employee with no complaints. I guess the question is why did they steal my jewelry regardless of weather the sign was on the door or not, which it definitely was. Why would someone enter my room without cleaning it, changing the towels etc. There was no signs that anyone had entered the room other than to take the jewelry box. Since the value of the jewelry was quite expensive they have failed to take any responsibility for the employee responsible... Hopefully LVPD will take some action and find the guilty employee.

Was not a fan of the room heater either, there is no temp setting only able to change it to low cold\/high cold, fan, low heat\/high heat etc which is a pain to change all the time.

Pros: 
- Fremont street is fun, this is a great location to check it out
- Decent restaurant selection in the hotel
- Nicely decorated for the holidays
- Carson tower rooms are not too run down, mostly up to date some old things mixed in (old lamps, TV, and popcorn texture ceiling for instance)
- Iron and ironing board provided in the room
- nice shower
- good pillows

Cons: 
- Sheets had something in them that made me break out and itch terribly, a quick google revealed other people having this issue
- Heater needs to be managed, no way to set the temp
- No fridge or microwave in the room
- No where to plug in devices next to the bed, there was an available outlet on the other side of the room

From the first moment until the last - total luxury. 
We stayed in the Gold Rush Club level. The room was beautiful, the bed was comfy, the pillows were sublime. Big beautiful double vanity bathroom with a separate toilet and a big deep wonderful bathtub. Even the towels, shampoo, soap, etc was delightful.
The lobby and bars were beautifully designed and very elegant. The happy hour at the Chart House was so good and so inexpensive and the view is a huge aquarium. The fish tacos were only 8$ and they were the best fish tacos I have ever had. I live in Southern Cali - so I have had a lot of Fish Tacos.
The pièce de résistance is the pool. It is listed as one of the most beautiful pools in the WORLD. Where do I start? How about the SHARK TANK - how cool is that - swimming with the sharks. There is also a fun water slide. Firepits and comfy couches, lounge chairs and double seated chairs abound.
I had a day bed in the upstairs ADULT ONLY pool - so cool. Had a DJ and plenty of servers and a nice pool, most importantly - quite.
The nightclub, Gold Diggers was pretty fun, but my favorite was the Rush Lounge - live music is always so fun.
The staff was prompt, helpful and courteous - everywhere from the lobby to casino to the bars to room service. A big shout out to Ramona Thielke and the Front Desk manager Johan - thank you.

The room was clean, not overly modern or impressive but the bed was comfy and the water hot. We had a terrible view of a back alley- only good part was we could see a reader bord that displayed the outdoor temperature. The pool is the main attraction at this hotel. The shark tank was beautiful but I was personally disappointed that the pool is in the middle of the hotel. People are walking around all day, playing slots, eating and resturants and watching people sunbathing and swimming- kind of weird. I enjoy the hotel pools that look a little more tropical and so it's a relaxing oasis, not a ton of chairs crammed on a concrete deck inside a glass box for all to see. I spent about 2 hours at the pool every morning and found it filled up fast so I would grab some starbucks, suncreen, a book and head down as soon as it opened (10am if I remember correctly) to grab a seat. We were there in mid-April and I found only one side of the pool had sun in the morning, then the other side in the afternoon...bad set up. The towers shade the pool. 

The hotel (like most in Vegas) was kept very cool. My husband loved it and I was freezing. I also was a bit irritated by the people who stand at a desk near the Gold Tower elevators and try to sell you their timeshare speech EVERY SINGLE TIME you are going back and forth to your room. 

We did quite a bit of walking around in Fremont on this trip and I believe the Golden Nugget is the nicest hotel there. I personally do prefer to stay on the strip so I think a lot of my review comes down to personal preference. 

We also tried two of three resturants in the hotel; The italian place- run the other direction it was disappointing. Their signature steak house - it was delicious but super pricey and the wine list was like a freaking encyclopedia to flip through and finally their Seafood resturant, Chart House, I had the stuffed sole and it was FANTASTIC. My favorite meal the entire time we were in Vegas. I'd definitely go back!

My boyfriend called to try and get the last two nights of resort fees refunded because had we known the shark chute was closed, we would have stayed at the 4 Queens next door which was cheaper and didn't have ANY resort fees.

We stayed in the Rush tower. The room was ok, but extremely loud at night due to outside music. 

We dined at the Grotto and it appears there were only three people working: hostess, waiter, and a frustrated chef.

We stayed here New Year's Eve and did the party in the grand ballroom and the Fremont st experience. The band in the ballroom was awesome and the food was great. 4 course meal with seafood and meat and open bar with premium liquor!

The doors don't open until 9 which I think should be a little earlier because I felt that we didn't have enough time to eat, drink, and dance. Would like an extra hour there. 

Right outside of the casino doors, there was a stage set up for Freemont at experience and blues traveler was playing! Great way to spend New Years!!

The pool here is awesome. The Hot tub gets a little crowded and isn't as hot as I'd prefer, but it's open from 7am-2am! Not a bad way to end a night. The slide is worth every bit of shivering after. Even though the pool is heated it still feels pretty cold after getting out. The sharks staring you in the face while sliding down is un like anything I've ever seen. Pretty cool pool!!

The golden nugget has always been at the higher end,  new room towers and new restaurants.  The basic rooms are in the Carson towers which is the farthest walking from Fremont street. They are older rooms and if your looking  for a clean cheaper options it's not a bad choice.  Because the Carson tower is at the back of the property they are among the quietest rooms with very little ouce ouce from the Fremont street experience.   I've also found the gold tower the next quietest followed by the rush tower.  This is the golden nugget thou and they tend to think of the little things , like ear plugs in the rush tower rooms facing Fremont.     

The gold and rush tower rooms are very nice and I've never had a bad room.  Always large rooms and lots of extras, water, coffee etc.  Onetime we managed somehow to get a free upgrade to a
Gold tower suite, it was 1000 sqft, had a bar, frig, full size living room. It was awesome. 

All this typing and I haven't even got to the pool, spa or the variety of restaurants.  The pool is the nicest downtown and really strip quality.  Well they actually have 2 pools. One for everyone and one for adults only.  The beds are not too expensive and a nice option when your not taking the water slide through the shark tank.  I'm a fish guy and always enjoy the fish tanks at the nugget, whether it's the shark tank at the pool or charter houses tank in the restaurant.  The charter house tank is packed with a nice variety of fish and all of them are spotless.

My favorite property downtown.  They've done a great job renovating it and putting in new restaurants.  For example, the Golden Nugget has the only Charthouse in town - a great seafood chain. 

This property has a couple of terrific fish tanks.  One in the Charthouse and the other at the pool, called The Tank.  Even though I am not a hotel guest, the staff has let me walk out and look at The Tank.  It has sharks in it!  Super cool to just stare at.  I also like staring at the tank in the Charthouse while I eat my lunch there.  Sometimes scuba divers will go in to clean it, which is amusing.

If you self-park in the garage, you have to validate at the casino cashier.  They allow you to self-validate so you don't have to wait in line, but it's a huge pain to find the casino cashier.  Plus the parking garage, like most in Las Vegas, is horribly designed.  I recommend just using the valet - there are two.  One off of Casino Center and another off of Main Street, just in front of the Charthouse.",2,0,3

You have the option of hooking your ipod into their system and controlling the volume through a knob on the wall in your cabana. Furniture was super comfy. Drink servers were very efficient and very nice. Ordered food and it came within 15 minutes with the food piping hot.

3) Daybeds lack umbrellas\/shade. Could be updated. The pillow\/cover on mine was torn. 

4) Valet is very quick, friendly, and efficient!

5) Bellhops were really slow and unorganized that weekend (EDC weekend).

6) Service at the buffet was wonderful. Waiters were very nice and friendly as well. Menu could use some updating. Loved their antipasto selection. Good salad bar.

7) I got the cheapest room possible, the Carson Tower room. After reading the yelp reviews, i decided to ask for an upgrade, but when i got there, they were  completely booked and I ended up stuck with my room. Honestly, the rooms are in great condition for what they are. Everything was very clean and spotless. Bathroom was humongous, and so was the room. The bottled fiji water in the room was ridiculously expensive so i used my phone to find a walgreens. Turns out, i'd forgotten to switch it to the ""walking"" mode, so it instructed me to walk all the way around the block. A very dark, stinky, and decrepit looking block. Save yourself a mugging and walk through the Fremont Street Experience. It's at the end of the road.

All in all, I paid 97.40 on bookit for two nights and also received a $50 cabana credit. The Golden Nugget is a great place to stay if you're checking out downtown with friends or family.

I paid for 2 rooms in the Golden Tower for 6 adults (the reservation was 1 room for 4 and 1 room for 2).  I was told I'd get 2 rooms with a king bed each.  When I replied that that was unacceptable, (seriously, who books 1 room for four adults in 1 bed?!) I was informed that I'd need to pay $33 extra per night for one room to be switched to include 2 double beds.  The young lady was snooty! I asked for the manager and the clerk walked away.  After a few minutes she returned and informed me that I would be ""downgraded"", in her snooty attitude, to accommodate the need for 1 room to have double beds and I would need to contact the 3rd party for a refund.  Again, this was unacceptable.  She then had the nerve to tell me there were no rooms in their ""Golden Tower"".  I demanded the manager again.  I waited an additional 5 to 8 minutes and finally she returned and I was finally able to be in the rooms I'd reserved.  The manager never showed up.

When we finally were in our rooms, we attempted to call for our luggage only to find that the phone and half the room was without power.

I started staying here in the early 1990s right after Steve Wynn acquired and remodeled the place, first in the South Tower, then North and eventually graduating to the largest two story suites in the Spa Tower. 

It is for the Spa Tower suites - particularly the largest, most ostentatious suites located towards the middle of the floor (not every spa tower suite is the same size) that I give the GN five stars. The spa tower suites include a jacuzzi and steam room (a full sized steam room in which several may sit - not just a shower steam). This hotel has everything you need - from among the largest suites available in Vegas to the restaurants, buffet, shows and spa\/gym, pool and amenities that, while on a different scale from the behemoths on the strip, are all first class. 

Service is first class, for all. VIP Services and casino hosts (both for gamblers only) all go out of their way to take care of you. 

The hotel spa includes all amenities with indoor steam jacuzzi and sauna, and adequate weight equipment (no free weights) and cardio. 

Sadly, the casino doesn't offer the best odds that it used to, which peaked during the brief period that Tim Poster and Tom Breitling owned the place, but then I quit gambling some years back, and the casino doesn't mean much to me anymore. In any case, ever since Landry's bought the place the casino table games all clamped down with subtle rules meant to handicap the serious gambler. I never was into slots, but understand that post-Landry's the slots are tighter than they used to be. 

But if you are a gambler at the Nugget, your play will earn you more comps than on the strip. 

The neighboring Glitter Gulch (also known as the Fremont Street Experience) is a nice little draw with all its lights and outdoor festivities at night. A short stroll down the Gulch leads to outdoor displays of classic Vegas neon. But don't stroll too far - go too far east on Fremont and you'll end up in still no man's north east Vegas that contains spots so unsavory, that no hotel limo or even taxi service will service them. When you see the old Las Vegas Metro PD substation, time to turn back - you've ventured too far.

The shark tank in the middle of the pool was very fun.  My son loved the slide that went down through the shark tank into the pool.  We had a great time there.

It was nice. Really nice. I mean I've stayed at the Hooter's Hotel on the strip for the same amount of money and that hotel DID have the $89 feel to it. Of course, when you're on a budget, you'll stay anywhere and Hooter's is directly across the street from the MGM so you can't go wrong with that.

The Golden Nugget is also in the heart of things, but not the things I'm used to seeing in Vegas. You're not going to see the dancing fountains of the Bellagio , nor will you see the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Hotel. Instead you've got a whole new set of attractions.

There's the waving cowboy - known as Vegas Vic, Binion's horseshoe and the famous lights of the Plaza Hotel. And when you are there, you have to take in the Fremont Street experience. It's crowded, crazy and completely wonderful in a way that is only cool in Vegas. 

Don't worry if you are not sure where this is. If you're in old Vegas, you ARE part of the attraction. That's because it's right outside your hotel. Fremont is a covered street that becomes a canopy of lights after the sun goes down, and they literally rock out to Kiss's ""Rock n' Roll All Night Long."" 

Nope, you're not going to hear Celine Dion in Old Vegas. It's sex, drugs and...maybe a little bit of whiskey on the rocks - just the way the Rat Pack liked it. 

Then there's the Nugget. Built in 1946, it's one of the oldest casinos in the area. But don't be fooled by its age. It has a four diamond rating and is still classy. When you walk around the lobby, it's not hard to imagine Sean Connery there during the shooting of ""Diamonds are Forever.""

Attractions in the hotel include the world's largest gold nugget (naturally) and a shark tank, but honestly, I was very impressed with the service and lushness of the hotel. It had the Wynn feel without paying the Wynn price. 

I must say, staying in Old Vegas was a gamble that paid off.",6,2,9

 food was great in the sports book area, the sushi place was good enough, but ate mostly away from casino so can't tell you much about the rest of the restaurants. my buddy took a good chunk of money from them on friday, and when i walked up, the pit boss was cheering him on instead of giving the evil eye ( which is what usually happens).

The cost was a little high, $11 for lunch, but not unreasonable.  

I thought the selection was on the sparse side, maybe I am used to larger serving areas.  From the items I selected my favorite were:  smoked salmon, crab salad, cream of mushroom soup, mac & cheese, brisket, fried catfish, and had a cream puff for desert.  The only thing I didn't like were the mozzarella balls.  They were mushy and flavorless.

I called twice over the next two months to confirm a smoking room in the Carson tower with a King bed. When we arrived I was told that all they had available was a room with 2 double beds. I was told that they don't actually ""reserve"" rooms, you get what is available when you arrive. 
We were charged a $28 a night resort fee that was supposed to cover wifi and the gym which we weren't going to use & bottled water in the room. Wifi if purchased separately was only $13 a day but now the resort fee is required.
We got to our room to discover only 1 bottled water, no robes, electrical outlets that didn't work, 1 coffee cup ($10 fee for 4 mini single serving coffees), a safe so tiny we could barely fit our 13"" laptop. The bed was terrible, we are used to a king bed and ended up smashing each other with elbows and knees all night. The air conditioner banged and clanked loudly all night. The room was dark and dingy, the window was partially covered by two sides of the adjoining building. The Carson tower \/ dark tower is a about a 2 block walk to Fremont street. It is the only tower with smoking rooms. 
To be fair they did refund $28 when we complained about the lack of amenities and condition of our room.   
We asked about discount tickets for food or shows and were directed to a desk to sign up for a 2 -1\/2 hour tour in order to receive them. No thanks
The pool was very crowded, no chairs available so we went upstairs to the adults only pool - you have to rent a lounge chair!! $45 a piece a day! If we would have wanted to sit up there for half an hour each day we were there it would have cost us a whopping $270.00.
Everything about the Golden Nugget is a money grab. There's a fee for almost everything. The restaurants are expensive and the machines are tight. 
In the past we have always stayed at Fitzgerald's (now the D) but thought the Golden Nugget would be a little nicer. We were wrong. The D always RESERVES our room, the views are excellent, upon check in we are handed a discount coupon book.

If you're staying there, try to get a North Tower Room, they are newer and a lot easier to navigate the hotel. If you get a South Tower Room, Fremont St to the Elevators can be a hike, plus you basically have to jab a timeshare dude out everytime you try to get to your room.

Oh plus if you're in a South Tower room you may have to walk miles, serioulsy I met some people there one weekend and went to there room to chill, and I swear it was a maze to get to their room!! Trust me spend the money on a North Tower Room.

The hotel Buffet was incredible with so many choice st breakfast and lunch. The food was great. We had vouchers because of our convention being held there. It was nice to have VIP service with no need to wait in line to be seated. The view from our breakfast table was lovely.
The only complaints I have is that in your room they have bottles of water but if you open them, they charge you for it! Wanna use the coffee machine in your room, another charge. And room service food was overpriced. Room service charge on top of the food was $5.  And since we were so tired and we forgot to order drinks, it would have been another $5  plus the cost of the soda so we drank tap water with our meal....not cool!!!
The rooms were clean but the tub was weird and concaved in on the sides so you did not feel like you were standing flat while showering. The bathroom sink countertop was installed too high which is a problem for shorter people trying to brush their teeth over the sink.
The shark chute slide was fantastic but closed at 7pm which is way too early.

Definitely recommend staying downtown as the vibe is much cooler, more mellow, and more classic. But the Carson Tower, where we were placed, is showing its seams, and we definitely feel like second-class guests out there compared to our friends who stayed in the Gold Tower. 

So it's a long haul to the Carson Tower. The Gold Tower elevators are right by the lobby, but you have to weave through the property to get to the Carson Tower elevators. Once up there, the layout is weird and only a couple of rooms are near the elevator. Our room was down a long, dark hallway and literally as far from the elevator as you could get. I know someone has to stay at the end, but it took 15 minutes every time we had to ""run back to the room"" for something. If the elevators were busy, it could take even longer. 

We payed the ""resort fee"" which was supposed to include 2 free water bottles a day, but we had to text a number to get them. We were there for 4 days and we only got the bottles once, after I texted daily. I finally had to call the front desk for them. 

Also, it says on the website, in no uncertain terms, that you can purchase a 2 pm check-out for $35. We asked about it at the desk a couple of times, because we didn't have to leave for the airport till 2:30 so it would have been perfect. The first person we asked didn't know what we were talking about and basically said ""not an option"". The second person said they could give us a ""complimentary"" noon check-out but for a later one we'd have to call the morning-of. Still no acknowledgment of the website offer. A friend who was also staying with us asked a different person and they said they knew of the website offer but that it was ""subject to availability"" which it does NOT say on the website. So on the morning of check-out, we called down and they said ""Ma'am, your room is not available for late check-out."" Of course not. If they never offered it as an option, it would have been fine. But offering on the website as a guarantee if you're willing to pay extra, then having some people not even know about it and others know but offer it only with impossible conditions (we were checking out on a MONDAY so it's not like were a ton of people waiting around for rooms), is super lame. Do or don't offer it. Don't string us along! 

Most egregiously, there is no coffee and tea service in your room. Even the crappiest motels I've stayed in have had a coffee maker and some cheap tea or coffee. I get that they want you to go to Starbucks but that's why you put crappy coffee in the room. People use that to get up and around and then they go to Starbucks. Of course, since nobody has coffee in their room, the Starbucks line is insane until about noon every day. 

There are some good restaurants in the hotel, the casino is cool, and the pool with the shark tank is cool but the water slide was closed the whole time. We mostly spend time in other casinos though and have our eye on one of the nicer ones for next time. Maybe the Grand or the Plaza. Get it together, Golden Nugget. I know you like your Gold Tower people better, but we're paying customers too.

Anyway, we paid around $90 a night with the resort fee and I've had a better experience at Motel Six, La Quinta, or Days Inn, where at least you get in-room coffee and free breakfast. It sucked to feel like no one on the staff cared about our hotel experience and that if they brought us water, they were doing us a favor.

The price of the room was excellent - purchased on Expedia.com.  The hotel had almost everything I needed and was within walking distance of everything else.  My kiddo's only requirement of any hotel we stay in is that it have a pool, which they do.  The shark tank was a plus as well as the slide!  During the day, get there early to grab a seat.  

Parking was easy in the garage near the tower we were in.  If you like coffee, you should probably figure out what to do.  The line at the Starbucks near the pool is ridiculous.  Absolutely ridiculous at pretty much all hours of the day.  The other Starbucks on the other side of the building is not as busy but has shorter hours.

We got married at the GN in 2009, spent our 1st anniversary there and thought it was time for another visit.  We booked a package deal for 4 nights.  On the 2nd morning my husband ran into housekeeping in the hall and they said they had us on their list as checking out that day.  Since our reservation was for another 2 nights we went right down to the front desk with our vacation reservation confirmation e-mail.  There, they were very unhelpful and accused our vacation company of sending them the reservation incorrectly.  The Golden Nugget said they could extend our stay at the regular nightly rate for our last 2 nights.  Obviously since we prepaid for a vacation package we weren't going to pay for the rooms again.  They said we needed to call our vacation company to figure it out with them.  So, we called the vacation company and they said they needed to get in touch with the Golden Nugget - I stayed on hold while they did this.  The woman kept coming back on the line to say that no one was answering at the Golden Nugget.  FINALLY 1\/2 hour later, someone answered and they got it straightened out.  The Golden Nugget admitted it was a clerical error on their end.  So, we went back up to the front desk.  The clerk at the counter offered no apology and said our reservation had been fixed.  I asked to speak with a manager as I was unhappy we wasted an hour of our morning on their mistake (not to mention, had housekeeping not told my husband they had us down as checking out that day we would have never known! We were going to the strip that day, so would our stuff have been gone when we got back that night??).  Again, no apology until I expressed how disappointed we were in the service we were receiving regarding their mistake and I asked for some type of compensation - a room upgrade or something.  He offered us 2 buffet lunch coupons, which we were not interested in (no plans to eat lunch at the hotel the next 2 days) and then he told us that was all he could do and our reservation was fixed, so everything was fine now.  Maybe everything was fine on their end, but we left the desk extremely upset at their lack of empathy, inability to own up to their mistake and poor customer service skills.  At the end of our trip when we were actually checking out we were told there was a charge to our room for 2 nights at full price!!  They did fix this right away, but it was just one more example of their incompetence.

Other Cons:  You have to pay for WiFi, but if you go down the street to the Plaza it's free and there are tons of places on the strip where it's free.  Rooms in the Carson Tower are dated and falling apart.  I understand it's the oldest tower, but some updates\/upkeep would be nice.  

Positives:  the pool, the super comfortable bed and the fact that it's downtown

This was definitely our last stay at the Golden Nugget which makes me sad because it is where we got married.  We experienced such fabulous customer service elsewhere during our visit that I couldn't imagine putting up with the less than mediocre service from the Golden Nugget again.",1,0,0

We have never been disappointed with our rooms until our last stay in October 2017. We chose the Carson Tower this visit, mostly because we hoped there would be less noise. All I can say is if you like to pay 190 a night for a Best Western knockoff, you will like this room. Bath was very dated with only one sink, and the tub was rusted, shallow, and very small. Worst of all, there was no coffee maker in the room. In its place was a placard advising of a Starbucks in the lobby. When I called to question this lack of an amenity found in all hotels I've stayed in for the last 50 years, I was advised they stopped providing coffee makers about a year ago. However, for a $40.00 deposit and a $10.00 rental fee, housekeeping would bring one to the room. For an extra $15.00, I could get a 4 pack of K-cups. I find this unacceptable, and feel as if Starbucks is in collusion with the hotel to force guests to buy overpriced coffee from one source. Between the overpriced small, dated room and the decision to force guests to go to the lobby and buy coffee from Starbucks, I cannot give a good review of the Golden Nugget Las Vegas.",0,0,0

I should have stayed on the strip and dealt with traffic and distance. The entire building wreaked of smoke inside. Poor ventilation. Room was ok but it still had that slight stale smoke smell. I felt like I carried it with me in public. That was embarrassing. 

The valet\/door men were incredibly rude. Like jaw dropping. Specifically a blonde male with an accent that worked evenings. My husband and I are from a magical land where Uber's can pick you up anywhere... not just one location. So we were going to a formal dinner on the strip and were waiting to be picked up along the roadway. This blonde valet walks over to us. Instead of asking us if we needed a cab or help, he demanded to know why we were standing there. We said we were waiting for our ride. He started yelling (not telling us, yelling and pointing in another direction) that share ride cannot pick up there, it's illegal. He did not offer us directions to the ""correct place"" or treat us with any courtesy. 

Again, as guests of the hotel, as guests spending several hundred a night on a lux suite, and as guests dropping money in the casino, this guy could kinda chill out and maybe just smile and try to be helpful. Because even if none of that was happening, how about just not being a jagoff and trying to help people out?

There are also bums. Everywhere.  All over Fremont St. Day and night. And they are very aggressive. It got to the point I got tired of going out. And I'm from Chicago.

When I saw the pool area, I thought about my kids.  The pool area contains an aquarium that contains multiple sharks, huge tuna, manta ray's, etc.  It also has a slide that goes through the middle of the aquarium.  You can swim right up against the glass and the show is spectacular.  The aquarium alone is the main reason we chose to stay at the GNugget for our first major summer vaca.

However, popularity has it's draw backs.  The pool water doesn't open until 10a, but the lounge chairs area opens at 7am.  That means, at 7am, there are people who come down and lay their items to hold chairs until 10am and that's BS.  Who says you can come down with your stinking shoes, magazines and hats and hold a chair for 3 hours?  F you, get your fat ass up and get down there.  There is a sign that states that holding chairs is not allowed, however not enforced.  There is a security guard making sure it's hotel guests only, but he doesn't enforce the holding of chairs.  Get down early and wait for 30 minutes like I did with a grumpy 6year old and explain why although only 50 feet away, we can't get in the water until 10am.  The rest of us normal members of society are down here.

The local cafe was adequate for bkfast, there are multiple Starbuck stands, the buffet just ok for lunch, nothing spectacular.  At $82 for 2 adults, 1 7, and 6, it was pricey for what we got.

Other than the pool and Fremont Experience, there is really nothing for kids.  There is a small arcade for the teens, but it's small.  The majority of our trip besides a jaunt to the strip was at the Nugget's awesome pool area.  We were able to order an adequate take out lunch and at our chairs with a tight knit lounge chair area, but plenty of water to keep us cool.  Again, get down early and stake out a space.  There is also plenty of shade and couch areas for anyone who doesn't want any sun at all.

We stayed as part of a special offer that allowed an upgrade to a Jr. Suite.  It had a little couch area that doubled as the teens bed with sheets and a blanket.  The three of us shared the ultra comfortable King as my fat ass, my 6 year old and my petite wife shared with ease.  The down pillows and comforter alone are worth the price. It turned out to be $139 a night for Sun-Tues.  Try to make a weekday happen, it's so worth the effort as opposed to Fri-Sun.  The traffic coming back on Sunday looked rough in the other direction and we were arriving in Vegas around 2pm.

The hotels in downtown Vegas (as opposed to The Strip) are for gamblers who don't necessarily need all the glitz, neon, and crowds.  Don't get me wrong, this place does get jumpin on the weekends, but the proximity to the other casinos downtown, coupled with the fact u can park your car for the weekend & never need it until u drive home (i'm from Southern CA) , make this a very attractive & convenient destination. Now on to the casino itself. The tables can get crowded but u can usually find a spot to park it and play.  There is a ""Party Pit"" area offering tables with scantilly clad dealers girls...  The staff are courteous and friendly.  If you do stay here, DEFINITELY book a Rush Tower room.  The Rush Tower was opened in Nov 2009.  I have stayed in the Rush Tower Jr Corner Suite and it is very nice!!  Spacious living area with dark wood decor, raintree shower, and two flatscreens (one for the living area & one in front of the bed).  They have also added a porte cochere. You really need to try Rush Tower.  It is definitely worth the price.  Also, if u plan to stay at the Nugget in the future, be sure to get a free players card, as they email you special (reduced) rates.

Yes, they renovated it, so it's brand new and not as disgusting as I imagined. It's very nice when you walk in. The Ice Bar is right there, and looks cool and classy, although the $14 martinis there reminded you this is not the low key place everyone says it is. 

Everything about the hotel\/casino is OK. 

But, I personally think Downtown is disgusting and am not sure why everyone loves it. I walked around at night, and was not impressed. Although they're trying to revive it, the downtown area just feels dirtyt. It brings the whole place down a star, so I would not call this a 4* hotel. 

I also don't like the pool in the middle of the hotel. If you're out there, you're in a fishbowl with everyone looking in. I like hanging out at the pool, but I had no desire to hang out at this one.

I took a day trip to Vegas last weekend and wound up spending most of it at the Golden Nugget.  Walking in, it struck me as being more like a casino on the strip than what I'd expect to find on Fremont Street.  No matter, I was just there for the day and just wanted to throw a few bucks in a slot machine.

Once I got to the casino section, it was a lot closer to my expectations.  I found a slot machine that looked interesting and took a seat.  Three minutes later, ""Error, calling attendant"" popped up on the screen.  I waited, and I waited, and I waited.  Finally a lady showed up and was very nice and took care of whatever was pissing off the slot machine.  Ok, I'll give them half a star back because she was so professional and friendly and actually apologized for the inconvenience.....in Vegas.

After trying a few of the machines, I got bored with gambling as usual.  So, what left to do?  Head to the bar.  I found their ""Ice Bar"" overlooking the pool area.  I then discovered their well was Tito's.  Sold!  I stopped in and had a few cocktails and chatted with some interesting people at the bar.  The bartender was top notch and made a killer Bloody Mary.

Finally, it was almost time to head back to the airport.  So, I sunk another $20 into a Wheel of Fortune slot machine, promptly burned through it and headed back.

I was a bit disappointed by the fact that it wasn't the low-key experience I'd been expecting, but at the same time impressed by what they've done with it.  I'll be interested to see what it's like to stay there in September.",4,0,2

Possible extras where 12.00 for wifi for one device,  Figi water 7.00  had basic cable so charged for movies.  No refrigerator but Ice bucket.  

I could subtract for the few negatives above but value wise these are extras that I can give up for the better prices they offer while an old dingy room\/hotel is unforgivable.

Bath had robes and nice lotions.  Flat screen tv with nice built in and dvd player. Sofa by window offered view of fremont street.    Parking is free for guests and there where no suprises on the bill.

The pool and casino are new looking even the parking structure has a glass elevator.  I preferred the walking distance buffet at Main Street Station or the paradise buffet at the Fremont Hotel but that's what so great about the Golden Nugget its a fun walk down Fremont street to all kinds of places.

The Golden Nugget has managed to maintain it's Old Las Vegas feel with New Las Vegas amenities. The addition of an awe-inspiring amount of Dale Chihuly glass lights and sculptures doesn't hurt. Neither does the pool area with plenty of lounge chairs and a three story water slide through their shark tank (which in and of itself, does nothing for me.).

The rooms were clean, the beds were new, and the shower was hot. Our room was far away from Fremont Street so we traded a view for peace and quiet. (Good trade.)

There is no concierge, so getting any questions answered quickly is impossible. The front desk couldn't even tell us how much the buffet was, so we went elsewhere for dinner. On the other hand, the valet and bell services folks are top-freakin'-notch.

For those of you who don't know, the lower pool area is open to all guests and is much more family and kid friendly - great for them and I'm glad they're having fun, but I'm 27 and single, and I was looking for a place to relax, enjoy a couple beers and read a book without being trampled by kids.  I asked to rent a $20 lounge chair, they said they were sold out and all they had were $100 ""day beds"".  I then asked if I could just sit at the bar, as only two out of probably twenty seats were taken.  They told me no because that was hotel policy.  I was pretty shocked - I'm paying a lot of money to stay here and I can't go sit at a nearly empty bar that's open and enjoy the facilities I've paid to have access to?

What was even worse was my talk with the manager, Julio.  I asked why the policy was in place so that maybe I'd understand where the hotel was coming from, and he said - and I quote - ""I don't want to tell you why we have that policy.""

I will NEVER return to this hotel, would rather sleep on a park bench.  and this isn't the first time I have experienced issues at this hotel, but it will be the last!

So I was in Vegas on business and I needed a hotel for 1 night.  My plan was to get up early around 4AM and make the 3 hour drive to Las Vegas for work that day.  Then I would check into the Golden Nugget for a well deserved good night's sleep and take my time heading back to L.A. the next morning.  Well, that plan didn't go so well.  Allow me to explain.

Since my company was paying for the hotel room, my choices were a bit slim.  And since I refuse to stay on the Strip with all the jack ass, obese, and belligerent tourists I decided to stay at the Golden Nugget.  (I should have slept in my rental car) 

The hotel room itself was located in the Rush tower and wasn't such a bad room, the problem lied with the unacceptable event and awful service that followed from the management.  After a hard days work and being up since 4am,  I finally went to sleep that night around 2am, ready for a GOOD night's sleep.

At 6:01AM on the dot!  I hear what sounds like an EARTHQUAKE coming from just outside my door.  Being an Angeleno, I jumped out of bed and stood under the door frame of the bathroom for cover.  Then I realized I was in Las Vegas and the chances of a quake were slim to none.  I opened my front door only to find 3 construction guys TEARING apart the hallway ceiling with a jackhammer!!!!!!  6:01 AM guys! This was UNACCEPTABLE!  

I picked up the phone and demanded to speak with the hotel manager.  When he finally got on the line minutes later I had explained what just happened and how this is unacceptable.  His response?......""Sir would you like me to move you to another room?"". Sure Mr. Manager, let me get dressed, pack up my things, change rooms, unpack again, and then try and fall back asleep.  NOOO! I don't want you to switch rooms!  What a jack hole!

The manager claimed he had NO IDEA that a hotel guest was staying where the hotel construction was taking place!....So let me get this right, with all the high tech computers you check your guests in with, and all the security cameras around the hotel lobbies and floors, you had NO IDEA that you put a guest in an area where workers were going to begin tearing apart your hotel at 6:01AM????? BULLSH**!

After arguing with me for what seemed like 30 minutes and denying that any of this was the hotel's fault and refusing to put me on the phone with his boss, he gives me the classic and insincere corporate apology!  

- Great customer service guys!  
- Way to build client relationships!
- Thanks for the good night's sleep!!!

maybe it had something to do with being spring break, but this place was overflowing with kids, and not teenagers, i mean kids (0-10). who brings kids this young to vegas?? i was with another cousin who has a young son, in which they planned ahead and organized a baby sitter. i counted 7 newborns at the pool! are you kidding me?! on the plus side, the water slide was fun...

the room was nice, but definitely not a room in which you can have a few people crash. i absolutely hated the fact you cannot lock the entrance to the bathroom. seriously, there are two huge sliding doors that open up to a fancy vanity, a lockable toilet room to the left, and a huge shower to the right, but you cannot lock the sliding doors. this would be a great room for a couple, but unfortunately, we requested two queen beds as we knew there would be more people tagging along, and something got fffed up during the reservation, and we were given one king (another reason for the two-star review). also, they make you pay for coffee and water in the room. 

the casino was fun, as i ended up winning, but holy crap, the people were so sketchy. mind you, i love staying downtown, and i know it's a bit seedy, but i was expecting a little bit more from the nugget. i have a feeling that the trash from around town migrate here because it makes them feel less trashy. unfortunately, splashing a fresh coat of paint on a crack house doesn't change the fact that it's a crack house. if this were the el cortez or californian, i wouldn't care, but jazzing something up so much for it to ultimately be a ruse is just pathetic...",0,0,0

The casino was good, and of you are looking for lower table limits, this was good or a short walk from some others that do have as well.  Outside is the Freemont Street experience, which is a hoot.  You get to walk under a canopy with videos and light shows and past numerous bands.  The biggest attraction is the people and performers.  The people include all walks of life, beautiful couples, lots of ""normal folk"", scattered homeless types, the later you are out the drinker everyone gets, harmless and  entertaining.  The Cadillac Mexican resturaunt in the hotel was great.  The huge aquarium was a cool backstage to the place.  I really thought the manager at check in was great.  When we checked in, later at night they at first said they were out of nonsmoking rooms, I get that this happens as there were five large conventions in town. The manager suggested that we wait 15 minutes, worked furiously at the computer and found son non smoking rooms.  Great service and effort!",0,0,0

We stayed here from 1\/16 to 1\/18\/09.   I'm so use to staying at The Cal or Main Street (not by choice!).....Golden Nugget is WAY better.

When we checked in, we requested a room at the North Tower but they told us it was sold out.  We were disappointed because the North Towers were  newer with upgraded linens and they had a view of their awesome pool with the tank.  So we had to settle with a room in the South Tower ...not too bad.  He gave us us a high floor with a view of the strip.  

A great tip, the front desk agent gave us is that the Golden Nugget has a VIP service where you pay an extra $20 upfront when you make your room reservation..... this will guarantee you a room of choice, in this case, I would have gotten my room at the North Tower.

Since the rooms didn't have mini refridgerators, housekeeping can bring one up - no charge!  How awesome was that.

Our stay here were great.  I wanted to try their buffet but it was closed due to renovation, so we chose to eat at their cafe for convenience, which was okay.  

We love the fact that this casino doesn't stink with smoke and the people who stays here are pretty mindful and friendly with others.

We love the bell desk service.  The guys were quick and prompt when I call them for baggage assistance.  They even got Valet to bring our car up so we didn't have to wait long at all.    Very good experience here for us.  We would definetly come back again.",4,0,1

For the price, it's got to be one of the best hotels in downtown. 

I personally dig the classic Vegas feel of downtown, so staying here is fine with me. 

Got to say the only complaint I have is that they didn't have any $5 Blackjack or Craps tables. Considering the economy and the fact we are in old-school downtown Vegas, I would think they would bump down the minimums?

The hotel management needs to give everyone a seminar in good customer service.  We checked in on July 2, check-in was adequate.  We were given our room keys with no direction to find our room.  We asked 3 employees where we could find our room and they did not know. I also had a hard time finding the gym.  Again, no one could help because they seemed clueless.  When I arrived at the gym it was $20 to use the facility!!!!! Unbelievable! Too top it off, our bathroom was leaking water. They moved us to a Jr. Suite - which was nice but it was right next to the Freemont Experience and the music was very loud.  We had to practically beg the management to give us the customary hotel guest coupons.  We decided to use the buy one get one free buffet coupon.  The buffet was horrible. The food was not fresh and seemed to have been sitting awhile or they recycled premade old food.  The waitress was super nice but the buffet did not have a good selection and like I said the food was stale.  One of the employees told us that the hotel was very stingy and would not give anything.  The day before check-out we decided to pack and move our car from valet and then go eat our last breakfast before leaving - we could not find parking anywhere. Since we had just stayed in the hotel we were hoping we could park in the hotel parking lot but we were very rudely escorted out by the security guard. He was SO rude! He told us you can park somewhere else if you don't have a key to a room in the hotel. We are never staying there again. It is old, dated, stinks, tight machines, and very rude staff.

Pretty standard hotel room, but the pool with the sharks was really cool, as was the water slide, and we also liked the adults-only pool upstairs.

I was initially given an already occupied room and it's odd that some other reviews have mentioned that as well... not an unusual occurrence I suppose. As others have mentioned, the resort fee kind of stinks and the $10 for coffee in the room is just silly. I also somewhat miss the old cafe, which is now a Claim Jumper\/Cadillac.

The staff was OK, but the service wasn't completely consistent. The main difference in the staff since my last visit is the addition of attractive female dealers in certain areas of the casino, clearly distinctive from the ""regular"" dealers due to their red outfits. The tradeoff is that their tables usually have less favorable rules\/limits (at least for Blackjack), so keep that in mind if you care about such things.

The Poker Room is about the same as it always was (pretty good, especially by downtown standards), but I will say the tournaments they run are MUCH improved in terms of structure than they were in the past. 

There always seems to be constant renovation which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but while some improvements have been made there are other things that have been neglected: for example, when I stayed in their two-bedroom spa tower suite -- one of their better, more expensive rooms -- I was surprised to find that it was a bit outdated, one of the bathroom doors didn't lock correctly, one of the fans seemed partially broken... just little things that demonstrated that maybe management isn't completely on top of all the details.

Overall, I still like the Golden Nugget and will almost certainly return... it just seems a little sloppier than usual at the moment. I wouldn't expect a flawless experience.",0,0,0

The macbook was completely ruined and the hotel staff and security took pictures of the ruined macbook and referred us to hotel risk management who said they would handle our claim. It took months over 5 months to even review our claim and offer compensation of less than the computer was worth. Rather than spend more time arguing we decided to accept the settlement of money they offered us and agreed to send them the broken water damaged computer. It has now been over 9 months and I have received no call no letter no email and no check. The dialogue between the  us has been completely unprofessional and one sided. I have made over 15 calls and attempts to contact them and deal with the issue. Most responses are either met with ""we are working on it"" or ""It's a long process"" if we even get a response at all. For a hotel and casino that pulls in millions in revenue every year you think they would care enough to pay for a small amount damaged property from a paying customer.

The resort is now a self-contained complex on 10 acres of land near Fremont Street, and contains 1 out of 3 of the downtown hotel rooms in three towers. 
  It is the only AAA 4 diamond hotel in downtown Las Vegas, and it's signature feature is the two aquariums. One has full size sharks and faces the swimming pool. The other is in the lobby of the brand new Rush Tower and is surrounded by the elegant Chart House seafood restaurant. There is a new entrance off Carson Street to the South. New artwork gives the place a rejuvenated feel.
   Other dining options are (1) Vic and Anthony's Steaks, (2) Grotto for Italian, (3) Red Sushi, (4) Buffet, (5) Carson Street Cafe, (6) The Grille. The buffet is the best (and most expensive) one downtown. However, it is still less than the cheapest on the strip.
  Entertainment headliner is Gordon Brown (comic, singer and impressionist).
  A major investment in downtown which hasn't seen a new hotel tower since 1989 (also at the Golden Nugget). I hope it pays off since so far business is so bad that earnings are lower then when they bought the place and sunk $1\/3billion in renovations.

Casino is located in downtown Las Vegas - meaning less crowd and less foot and vehicle traffic. The rooms we stayed in are adequate (four rooms total with adjacent doors between two rooms that made the rooms feel more like a suite). Not the typical you-can-get-lost-here kind of a casino. The layout is smaller compared to the strip hotels with only 3 or 4 hotel towers within the compound. 

If you are dipping in the pool, make sure you reserve a private cabana that easily fits a party of 15-20 people ($250 per day equipped with a ceiling fan, lounge chairs, fridge, champagne bucket, ice, flat screen TV, DVD, piped in muzak, and complementary fruit tray). It's well worth to have a place to relax and cool down in the blasting Nevada heat.

There's also a 200,000-gallon aquarium in the middle of the pool that houses more than a dozen 15-foot sharks and other sea creatures. It's really cool. Watch scuba divers clean the inside glass of this ginormous tank while they fend off the sharks from getting a chunk of human flesh.

Life is bumping and if that's what you're into, you're in good shape.

The room was decent, too. Not old school. I was on a non-smoking floor and it didn't have too high of a stench of cigarettes, and even though my window had a view of the parking garage, I'm not going to complain. If you're staying in downtown Vegas and you want to stay in your room the whole time, what are you doing, really?

All of that said, this is a quantity affair. They have a lot of tour buses and groups, conferences, aging tourists, and other people cycling in and out in droves. I don't expect a boutique hotel experience, and this hustle and flow of the hotel is really what Las Vegas in the downtown and strip area are all about, so just take that expectation with you. It's a hopping place and you just sorta fall in line and get to your room, and go downstairs and push levers and buttons, and go out to the street and do the thing that you do in downtown. It's fun for a night and you'll find nary a better launching off point than the Nugg.

All of that hustle and bustle comes at a price, though. The check-in line seemed to be moving kinda slow, but they did direct me to another desk with the giant aquarium behind it. And speaking of aquariums, the big shark tank by the pool was being repaired, so no sharks. And speaking of the pool, that sucker fills up fast and it's elbow to elbow people. That's the nature of Vegas in the heat, but it's not my scene.

Everyone I dealt with seemed pretty friendly. My coworker had about 9 run-ins with housekeeping after a booking snafu that took a while to iron out, we couldn't quite get the water situation figured out (the housekeeping staff who cleans cannon deliver water due to chemicals being used?), but the WiFi worked fine for me and my room was clean upon arrival.

***  THE ROOMS  ***

There are three room towers:  The Carson, The Better Tower, and The Rush.  

Carson rooms are OK, with somewhat dated furnishings and somewhat beat-up hallways, but they recently got rid of the tube-TV's, at least.  They've always been clean and with hot water aplenty.  My last room had an under-the-window AC unit that was incredibly loud and rattly, and cycled on and off in 5 minute intervals.  If you don't pass out as well as I do in Vegas, it could be a problem.

Another $20 or so a night gets you The Better Tower (I think it's called The Gold Tower?), which has rooms that are the same size as the Carson, just with newer furniture and plusher duvets.  Not that you'd ever want to snuggle up to a hotel comforter, but you get the point.

Another $30 or so a night gets you the The Rush Tower.  These rooms are done up in 2009-chic dark woods and have a sofa lounger.  And I don't recall ever hearing the AC in them.  Rush Tower has its own entrance and check in desk too.

*** THE CASINO ***

Gone from OK to kinda sucky, and it's extra-smoky.  
Once upon a time they had single- and double-deck Blackjack without the 6-5 payout and all that other house-edge nonsense.  No more.  Even some of the 6-deck BJ's have restrictions attached.  Craps is like it is anywhere else, however. 
Video poker has been dialed back from full 9\/6 payouts to 8\/5's or worse.
Occasional loud prostitute catcalls from little nuggets of the evening hanging out around the large central bar.

*** RESTAURANTS AND WHATNOT ***

The Grotto is pretty damn good.  Details to follow in a separate review.
The new Claim Jumper (""CJ's"") is really good and 24 hrs.
Comped drinks aren't any more watery than the ones you buy, which are standard-strength.
The Gold Diggers nightclub isn't too clubby, doesn't appear to have a dress code, plays a mix of classic to current stuff, and provides a smashing view of Fremont Street.
There's a bar in the casino area that has fun classic rock and dance hit bands play.  Small dance floor is entertaining.
I'll cover the pool in another review.

When we got too hot we would walk around the corner and slide down through the middle of the sharks tank into the below pool. It was fun. 

I would def. spend a day there. We were getting buckets of beer (bottles of corona) for like $25 delivered to our day bed.

DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL .

I stayed there from 03\/18 to 03\/20 for my daughter soccer tournament . I woke up on my last night itching and with bed bugs bites on my legs . I moved the sheets and found bed bugs on the mattress ....
 I called front desk and they sent security to the room . He took pictures of the bites on my legs and the bugs on the mattress . He filled out a report and gave me the case number . He said risk manager needs to go in the room and check it but they don't work on Sundays .
 I had to leave the hotel to go to my daughter's game and when I went to check out for my surprise the made me pay for the room . The manager told me I would be contacted by Risk manager and if they decide those were bed bugs I could have my money back . Its being 4 days and I have being calling Risk management everyday and they never call me back . 
 I went to bedbugsregistry website and found out that same thing happened to other people .
 I will be contacting the local health department about this .

Well there was a huge platter of non shelled shrimp and small selection of sushi that was it... Other items such as their meatballs sandwich selections were completely dried out.... Salad bar was very small was expecting a bigger variety... Mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese tasted like instant from the pouch or box... Their desert selection was ok cheesecakes were left out too long very dry, usually you can dive in the middle but that wasn't happening either. May try this place again but wasn't what I expected.

Memorial Day weekend with hundreds of people at the pool and only a few servers making the rounds, and a line 10 deep with only two bar tenders filling people's multiple orders? Makes no sense.

I have been a regular guest at this hotel for the past 5 years and have chosen to stay there because I always felt safe.  I travel alone often and this hotel has always met my needs for privacy and comfort.  I was very disappointed with the staff on this last trip however.

When charging items to a room they would ask for your room number and last name out loud and most guests would respond aloud not thinking twice about it.  I know that there are crazy people out there who would take advantage of such information.  When I was asked for my room number ad last name I simply handed the waitress my Guest Services card which told her what she needed to know.  She gave me a hard time about it and asked me again.  I explained to her that I would not reveal my last name and room number aloud and she had everything she needed in her hand.  The hotel purposely gives guests such a card to use for such an occasion.  Afterwards I was so bothered by this encounter I called to speak with the Guest Services manager.  I was told he was on the other line and he would call me back.  I left a message as to what the conversation was regarding and left my cell phone number in case I was out of my room.  NEVER HEARD FROM THE GUY!  

I am not one to rant and rave about issues.  In fact, I tend to be positive about places I visit\/stay but this really upsets me!  How can you completely ignore a call from a guest who is worried about her privacy??   I am so disappointed in the service I received.

I do think the Casino is nice along with the food and pool.  It is nice to be on Fremont street without all the noise in the room.  I would have gladly given this hotel 5 stars had the Guest Services Manager simply called me back.  I just wanted to make him aware of the the privacy inconsistencies is all.

I booked my room the morning of my stay as a road stop on a trip to UT. The wait to check in took a little longer than I would have liked considering it was midnight on the day after Christmas. But we found out that the hotel was sold out for the evening, probably due to the fact that it was considerably less in price than anything available that night. The staff was great and in order to give me a room with two beds (so I didn't need to share a bed with my teenage son) I was upgrade to a suite in the spa tower which had two bedrooms, a bar, sunroom and two whirpool baths. I wish I had booked for three days and skipped the rest of the trip. I was not there to gamble so I can't comment on the casino, only to say it was brighter, cleaner and much more apealling than I expected. The access to the room was easy from the parking garage, much easier than the mega resorts on the strip and the valet attendants let me leave my car in the wait area out in front of the main entrance to make it easier for me to move my things up to the room.

Cascading water, three levels of deck chairs, and a massive aquarium with a shark tank smack in the middle. Plus a killer water slide that goes right through the shark tank at the end. Don't talk to me about the Golden Nugget until you've tried the slide.

On the minus side, the faucets released what smelled like the scent of hell every time we turned them on. Also, our trash was not emptied when we first checked into our room and there was a pair of white Vans with some sort of blood stain on them sitting under a chair.

Maybe it's easier to do so when you have kids, because I've seen pictures of their heydays in downtown before I came along (cue in 70s music).

So this was my first time staying away from the strip.  My brother-in-law recommended the Golden Nugget as it is supposedly one of the cleaner and modern looking hotels, so I searched for good deals and decided to book through Vegas.com (booking through this website was easy, but your reservation won't show up until 7 days prior to your stay).  The only contact I had with the actual hotel was when confirming reservation over the phone (which the guy recommended us getting the VIP card that costs an additional $25 + tax to secure the ""non-smoking, double beds"" in our room) and checking in at the VIP check-in (we couldn't find it initially because it's in an enclosed room) - so I guess I can't say whether we had good customer service or not, but the 2 families who came with us both said service at general check-in sucked.

Hubby, kids, and I stayed on the 21st floor of the Carson Tower (22 floors total), which I guess have the cheapest rooms compared to the standard rooms in the Gold Tower and Rush Tower, and is furthest away from the casino and Fremont Street.  Either way, it was clean and roomy enough for 2 adults and 2 kids.  The beds were surprisingly comfortable and the alarm clock conveniently had an iPhone charger, which helped since we had to charge other technologies with the charger that we brought from home.  Beware: bottled water $7, Keurig $10, internet $12.99\/day, and no fridge (don't bring anything that needs to be cooled).

The highlight of this hotel IMO was the pool.  Hubby and kids went in (I went gambling inside with one of my friends during this wonderful kid-free time), and they had a blast.  We all loved the pretty aquarium\/shark tank and the slide that goes through it.  It does get crowded pretty fast though and people will try to steal your lounge chairs if you're not guarding them.  It is also pretty at night so my friend and I tried to have some drinks at the H2O bar, but unfortunately it was too cold for us even with the heaters on (we ended up drinking at the Grotto bar where we had a great server).  We didn't really eat here as I saw the ratings on Yelp, but we did try the Carson Street Cafe for lunch due to time constriction (will write a separate review for that).

I found the VIP check-in .. they were very friendly and there was only one other person in front of me!
I gave them my credit card and ID... they gave me two keys and directed Me to the Gold Rush Tower!

The room was super Clean and had a lot of space, large and comfy bed, separate dining area, comfy L shaped sofa, two TV's and the bathroom was huge!  It had a double shower, separate bath tub and enclosed room just for the toilet. 


Of course the main highlight was the pool, water slide and aquarium u zoom past in the slide. Seeing sharks up close was fascinating!

I enjoyed this buffet very much!
We went for the champagne brunch on a Sunday.  it was $17.99 per person. The lady at the register was a pretty rude.  I really didn't appreciate that...
But our waitress was so nice! Very polite and attentive to our needs.
The buffet isn't too big but it has a good selection.  My favorite part of the buffet may be the omelet guy.  That was probably one of the best ones I've had!  
There were so many desert selections.  They also have hand scooped ice cream.

There were also 3 choices of champagne. You could get basic Champagne, Mimosas, or Poinsettias (sp?) which is what I got. It's basically cranberry juice and champagne for those that don't know.

On night number one I got to snag a room in the outdated tower, which wasn't too awful, but after switching to the newer ""rush tower"" it's quick to realize the more expensive rate. 

My only gripes about the rush tower room are the lack of electrical outlets the fact that I was staying on the fifth floor. I love having my phone next to me when I go to sleep like I assume most of us do. It serves as a clock, my internet access and a speaker to listen to some tunes. A dead phone is useless, (which usually happens in Vegas) and not having a place to charge it bedside was a killer. The biggest gripe though? THE SHARK TANK WATERSLIDE IS CLOSED! For those who know, this is an absolute deal killer as it's a main attraction for Golden Nugget. Oh well...

Thank god for blackout curtains because if you're staying on the fifth floor, it's day time all of the time.

The beds were SO nice and comfortable.  Our room was very, very clean and the shower was nice.  The A\/C was great.  

The pool was a little dirty and murky and made me wonder if people had spilled their drinks in it.  There was a ton of kids and very few pool chairs available.  The pool may be heated but it isn't heated very well - it was pretty cold even though we went at 5 p.m. on a 100 degree day.  The waterslide is a neat idea but nothing to write home about.

Checking in was a nightmare.  We walked to Carson Tower only to find that that registration desk was closed and we had to go all the way back to the front of the hotel.  (This would not have bothered me, but I was saddled with an autistic 4 year old and our luggage all by myself.)  

It was a fun experience and I would go back, mostly just for the nice beds and to show my husband the pool.  I just hope it's a little cleaner in the water next time we go.  The employees were all very nice and very helpful.  If you buy anything from the Golden Nugget store, you will be price gouged ($9.69 for a 3 oz bottle of contact cleaner, ouch!)

Our experience here started out amazing. The valet, then the front desk...the most friendly and inviting people in Vegas, and that is not an exaggeration. We have been loyal to another(downtown) hotel\/casino for years, but the service sent us away, and that is when we decided on the Golden Nugget for this trip, and hopefully for all of our (monthly)Vegas trips. 

After arriving to our Carson Tower room, we were exhausted from the drive, and decided to rest. 
Unfortunately, in the middle of the nap, our door was opened abruptly by housekeeping, with no knock or anything. Before we could wake enough to figure out what was going on, they were gone. No big deal, as we understand mistakes happen. Probably the wrong room for cleaning. 
After a quick nap, it was time to shower and to get ready for a Vegas night! But to our surprise, the shower was FILTHY with dirty wash towels, soap stains and the like. We thought something is not right about this, so we called down to the front desk. Our concerns were met with an attitude of not caring. We were told that house keeping would be up within 15 minutes...25 minutes passes, so we call back and ask for another room, not an upgrade, but just another room, to which we were told that there are no other rooms and that they are 100% booked. (Did I mention that we have reservations and need to shower?) Well, that turned out to be false, as we were able to go on to Hotels.com and book the same exact room, in the same tower, without an issue, for the same price as we paid for this room that wasn't ready to sell! After another 15 minutes, an extremely nice lady knocked on the door and then proceeded to properly clean the bathroom.

Feeling a little like Jack Burton I spent some quality time at the craps table, and had a fairly successful time until the boxman starting yelling at me in a very thick accent (one would gather it Chinese in origin) about a five dollar minimum, which I was clearly well above on that roll.  

Becoming a bit flustered by this confusion, I felt what little mojo I had leave the room. And then like Lo Pan flying through that alley, Duke's money disappeared into thin air. I don't blame this gent for my loss, but I just wondered why he couldn't count my chips on the table.

So he wanted to come back any enjoy the hot tub again (which the other hotels don't have them open this time of the year) When we step in to registration at the front desk, it was very beautiful, but we noticed there was only one person checking in customers and there was a line all the way to the door! The hotel staff didn't seem to be bothered that people were getting annoyed waiting in line for a 1\/2 hour. Plus, the overhead music was far too loud for a hotel. It should be backgound music, not a concert.
Well, we finally get checked in...they upgraded up to the 23rd floor and yes we were very pleased by that. (we paid 60 dollars extra for that) The room was beautiful!!!
So we go downstairs and started drinking and playing. Everything was pretty cool until bedtime..OMG!!! the walls are paperthin. Fremont street was IN OUR ROOM!!!!
WTF!!!! We could hear everything and could NOT sleep at all!!! It was so bad my husband had to call downstairs and ask them to move us to a room away from Fremont street. They did, the NEXT day. Anyway...we decided to use the hot tub. We got out suits on and found out they only had one robe for two people in a suite???
So the hubby calls housekeeping, they don't answer. He calls the front desk and tells them whats going on. They said they would take care of it. Half an hour later, hubby calls again, not in a good mood. Housekeeping finally shows up with two robes!
Then we go downstairs in our robes, but we have to parade ourselfs though the whole freaking casino in spa robes just to get to the hot tub (we look stupid, but there was no other way to get there) What kind of morons run this place????
Okay, relax now we are down to the hot tub and we take off our robes and I put my feet in, the water is ICE COLD!!!!!!!  My Hubby is PISSED now!!!
This whole trip was based on this, oh man he's NOT happy. The so-call express check out was a joke too. All it is ""Leave a message"" You don't get an itemized bill or anything. If you want that, go stand in line with the one guy they have at the front desk in the ""Rush Tower"". And last but not least...here is the kick in the pants.

The rooms have all been renovated with comfortable beds and flat screen TVs. Their standard rooms are fairly large with more than enough walking space...it's not cramped and compact. Unlike, their neighboring casinos, the Golden Nugget is very clean...clean like they vacuum their floors and dust the slot machines. And also unlike their neighboring casinos, their cocktail waitresses don't look like they just got paroled or was pulled out of a mail order bride catalogue to pass out mardi gra beads!!! LOL! 

The rooms are very affordable, esp if you stay mid week (Sun-Thurs)...about $60 a night. I believe weekend rates can go up to $150 for a standard room, but still more reasonable than the $250 and up they offer at the strip hotels. The most appealing aspect of the hotel is their swimming pool, which they call the Tank. It's a nice sized pool that surrounds a shark tank...it's great. There's also a slide tube that takes you in through the shark tank and empties into the pool area, too. There's plenty of lounge chairs to catch some sun...and if you've got the dinero, you can rent a private cabana for about $75 for a half day.

First, the service. 2\/5, service here started on a bad note. after exiting the cab the handle snapped off of our baggage. Being a wheelchair user trying to get my bag just to the curb was a chore, no less than three bellman walked by, one guy three times.  we commandeered a cart and after entering the hotel were quickly noticed and chastised for taking it, after an explanation we were finally assisted. On another service related note, you are provided two bottles of water per day for your room but it must be requested. Really? This should be replenished daily without question. 

The gambling: 3\/5 I purposely came to old vegas for good drinks and better odds.....neither exist while gambling here. I brought 5k in ""mad money"" expecting not to bring it home. Blackjack pays 2:1 here, disappointing to say the least. At the table I requested Knob Creek, my go to drink. ""we don't serve that here"", ok, Makers mark? nope, not that either. Ok, what do you have? Well, just bring me the best you have and make it a double. ""we don't serve doubles here"" WTF! What happened to LAS VEGAS! After winning a couple hundred at blackjack even with the poor odds, I proceeded to the crap table where I won several hundred more.  Fortunately for me the headache from the crappy booze kicked in before the buzz and I left with my winnings. Sure I won, but I felt so miserable it lacked enjoyment. 

The room: 4\/5, props here. I have stayed at probably a dozen different places in Vegas and this was by far the best wheelchair accessible room with a properly arranged roll in shower (room 15216). The toilet wasn't exactly ideal and the bed was maybe 2 inches too high for flawless transfers, but it was the best I have found in Vegas including the MGM, Mirage, Flamingo, Monte Carlo, etc.

Side notes: The pool is definitely one of the best in town. Dining was just average for Vegas, the bright moment was our waiter (Michael?) at the chart house. Although I came home with more money than I left with (a RARE occurrence) I would only return for the room. Come on Golden Nugget, bring back quality booze while gambling everywhere with ""old Vegas"" odds and you would have a winning combination. Change that and I will give you a chance at getting some money back.",0,0,0

I would be willing to stay here again when I decide to stay on Fremont St if I can get a room cheap enough, hopefully I will get some hotel discounts from them since I signed up for their players card and I gambled like $55 away here so I would think they would want me to come back by offering me room discounts.",1,1,0

One of the valets simply stole the baggage cart we'd planned on using when we notified him that we'd be taking our own luggage in.   The desk people generally sucked and were short with us.

A year before our wedding, we booked our suite online and then contacted the hotel to arrange the block of rooms. It was an absolute nightmare dealing with the GN. Supposedly the contract was mailed to us. Never got it, so I called and emailed our contact person, Barbara, multiple times over a 3 month period, but she'd never return calls or emails. Nobody else in her office would assist us. Finally I had to get very stern with someone else in her office to finally get the contract emailed.

My other issue with the GN was that the max # on our room block was booked, but when one or two guests cancelled their reservation prior to the deadline, the GN kept the rooms, keeping other wedding guests from being able to book the rooms at the price we'd locked in with the block. The month before the wedding they were also unwilling to give us an update on the number of rooms that had been booked or were still available.

Upon arrival at the GN's ""VIP Check-In,"" we were treated indifferently, despite knowing we were there for our wedding, that we were spending $2000 on our suite, and that more than 16 rooms had been booked at their hotel by our wedding guests.

After hearing about the Nugget's awesome water slide (that GOES THROUGH A SHARK TANK), we booked a room in the middle of our stay elsewhere. First impression: this place in general is a lot nicer than I'd expected. While the casino does show some signs of its age, the lobby could have fit in perfectly with the fanciest resorts on the Strip. Our room, while a little dark, was still much nicer than expected.

Now, onto the pool. As I mentioned before, the draw here was SHARK TANK WATER SLIDE, and it did not disappoint. Not only can you slide through a tube that goes through a tank full of big toothy sharks, but the rest of the pool surrounds said tank and makes for great observation. There is tons of lounging space around the pool, including couches and what were essentially big round ""beds"" (you know, in case you want to play Vitruvian Man). A couple of ice buckets of beer ($20 for 5 beers, not too bad), a swim in close proximity to man-eating fish, and you've got a recipe for a fantastic afternoon.

Like I said, now that I've tried it, I would actually consider coming back for a longer stay. The Golden Nugget has the glitz of new Vegas (at least as much as I can handle), but still retains the more laid-back, non-ultralounge vibe of old Vegas.",2,1,0

We arrived on Thursday and instead of getting our king size bed we had paid for, we were placed into what seems like 2 double twin size bed. We were given an option to upgrade our room and it would cost us $30 more per night, which I opted not to because I know what I booked for and what I paid for.  When I asked, the lady told me, ""we are out of King size beds right now, we can place you in one tomorrow after it becomes available, we will call you."" 

The lady who checked us in took down my phone number down and never once did we received a call that day. We waited ALL day on Friday.

 Saturday comes, my fiance walks down to talk to them, the tall white guy manager tells him, we can move you to another room now - at this point we were done, we spent 2 nights out of our 3 nights in the room we did not want already... So my fiance told the manager no, the manager then offers us what sounded like a great way to make it up to customers. He said, they will remove the daily resort fee off ($28\/day).. So we agreed to it.. Please explain to me how me and my fiance who's a little over six feet tall and weighs 205 pounds is supposed to fit in a little bed that seems to be the size of a twin size bed?? We're not overweight people. And we're not ones to complain, and if honesty was given to us, we would've been okay with it.

 Sunday comes around for check out, we were still charged a resort fee of $56.00 for 2 days. When I asked why, the guy (after speaking to his Manager (same manager as Saturday) who didn't even have the audacity to come speak to his customers after telling my fiance something different) told us that they only waived one of the resort fee of $28.00 and that I was still responsible for the $56.00 resort fee.

I had high hopes given the history of the hotel and many of the reviews I read online. The rooms were decent with the exception of the incredibly noisy air conditioner, but the distance from the hotel lobby to our hotel room was a little annoying especially since the elevators we either not working or way too slow. Just to get down and out to Fremont was a 15 minute ordeal. There are other hotels on Fremont that much easier to navigate. 

The hotel staff were not very welcoming or helpful. I felt as if me checking in was a problem for them. We had issues with our room safe. From all the times we have travelled with room safe issues, we can usually call and then leave if there is nothing in the safe and they will come when they can. However, we did not know this is not the policy at the Nugget. It took almost a full day to get them coordinated enough to replace the battery of our open safe. 

All in all, I wouldn't recommend anyone to stay here. We gave it a shot for the sake of the pool, but with the lack of chairs available and slow staff service, I wouldn't do it again. If I want to go I will just pay to get in. I will just go back to the hotel I prefer on Fremont.",6,0,0

Staying here during a weekend-long event, the hotel and it's casino, pool, and buffet areas were 'home base' and 'ground zero' for a huge group of party-goers-- and since we had booked our room through the group's room block months in advance, the rates were pretty reasonable, too (not so reasonable outside of the room block, though: it seems that the Nugget was charging quite a bit more for whatever rooms were still available on the weekend we were there due to a festival going on at the same time).

Was contacted by property or told it would not be a problem when getting to the actual Hotel I was told there were no Spa rooms that none of the rooms had spas. I was also told that this jacuzzi we're located next to the pool and we're open till 1.

The windows were filthy covered with dirt so the view wasn't as beautiful as it should have been. We're not really complainers so too us these were minor issues.

So my husband and I planned our day out and decided we would visit the jacuzzi later that night it was a little windy during the day so we didn't go then. When grabbing dinner to go up to our room my husband stopped at the pool to ask about jacuzzi and was notified that it was going to be closing early because no one was gambling. My husband was very upset this was one of the main reasons why we wanted this hotel for a spa tub or jacuzzi. My husband then went to a manager who shrug their shoulders and basically said get over it. The next morning my husband talk to another manager at the end of the day we got nowhere.

I had always heard such great things about it, so I figured I was in for a treat. When I made the reservation I asked all the questions - and especially since I would be arriving on a late flight, I wanted to make sure that there would not be any problems. The lady that took the reservation said she would make note, and we would be fine when we checked in so late. I also asked about how much their hold per night was for amenities, and was told $100, but it could be waived if I asked - she said she would also note that on the reservation. 

So just before taking off I make a last minute call to make sure that all is fine, and we will have a room when we arrive. Good thing - nothing was noted on the reservation about our late arrival!! So by the time we get to the hotel is almost midnight, and we go to check in and of course there is drama.......they don't have a clean room where we are supposed to have it, so we end up in the very back of the Carson Tower facing a wall.

Now at the desk while checking in I ask again about the hold on the credit card, and tell the gentleman about the whole conversation - and that I wanted it waived because I don't use any amenities. He tells me not to worry because they are not holding it - and we head to the room. 
So unfortunately this time money is a bit tight, and I had only 1 card to use for the whole trip - well we go to eat, and present the card for payment.......and what happens, it is declined!! They had put a $400 hold on my card!!! 

I was terribly upset, and had to go back down to the desk - since you can't ever get a representative on the phone. For some reason they never answer!! So I go downstairs to speak with the Manager, and he says all the right words, and the I'm sorry's - and says he can have it credited back in the morning. He then also offers to upgrade our room to the Gold Tower - which I take him up on. Turned out to be a better view - more comfortable beds, and such. 

The next morning the hold money is still not back on the card - and after several calls it is finally resolved. Now we head up to the buffet, held up with all of that, and we still have about 20 minutes before breakfast is over. We head to the food stations, and they already have lunch items out. We see a few things, eggs, bacon, biscuits & gravy and grab a plate. As we get to that station - they guy behind the counter grabs the stuff and starts changing them trays to lunch. I see the biscuits & gravy sitting there, and I say ""can I have one of those""?......and you will not believe what he does.....he takes the tray of biscuits and throws them away and says ""breakfast is over - it's lunchtime""!!! I was furious - there was still 15 minutes of breakfast left, and he had nerve to do that. Then I hear another woman behind the counter yell the same thing at me. I got no resolution with the manager, and was completely disgusted that I had even spent my money there!! 

We did try the Cafe one night - food was tasty, service great. 
Never went to the pool - it was like a meat market!! Cute little girls serving drinks, guys staring and drunk, etc. Looked nice though! 

The beds in the Gold Tower were extremely comfortable!! Slept well in them! 

Did notice the hotel is kept very clean - they shampoo the rugs at night, and clean all the lights, good maintenance. Also the rooms are serviced well. 

Used the bus system to get to the Strip - there is a bus stop across Freemont St, so it was very convenient. 

Overall it was ok - not horrible, and not great - but would stay there again.",0,0,0

I think I've discovered another layer of hell in what is Las Vegas. Thy name is Golden Nugget. Seriously, this place is what trashy ass people think may be fancy. Oh, where do I start.... Well, lets start with check-in.

I wanted to stay at this hotel because it was the main hotel used for Punk Rock Bowling. I figured that it must be okay if the event locks in rooms there, plus it was close to where my friends were staying at The D. So I walk in and boom- GAG! COUGH! COUGH! Is this 1995 or 2015? WHO STILL ALLOWS SMOKING INDOORS?! Are you kidding me?! Gross. Also, why is there such a late check-in? So, after an eye-spraining eye-roll, we make it in the maze that is the hotel\/casino and enter into our room. At first glance it seems okay and an upgrade from The D, but not by much. What I do notice is that the room is not as cool as it should be for such a hot day. At first I think, no problem, I will just turn the system down. NOPE. Turns out that there is a controlled thermostat and limits how cold you can make your room. Now, picture me coming from Texas to this weather (we hadn't gotten fully hot yet) and I am dying and slow, painful death. After calling to get the unit serviced, I figured out what was going on because it is the same crap I've encountered before. Anywho, I get over the heat and cool down a bit and finally decide to explore the room. For a place that charges you a ""resort fee"", I don't feel like I'm getting any perks. The internet is so slow that I opt to just use the LTE system from my phone company. The two bottles of water they provide you a day has to be tap from California. The pool was really small for what I would think a ""resort"" would have. Also, I didn't want to swim in there after looking at a few crusty punks floating around in there. I know those kids have more money than I do, but funk knows no socioeconomic bounds. No thanks. Whatever else the ""resort fee"" is supposed to cover is beyond me because I just see it as $20\/night wasted. I guess the free parking is cool, but I did not get a rental car (big mistake) so I dunno. 

I looked around the room and found the room safe that was meh at best. I prayed that I would be able to get my medication out of it. But you know, it did not matter if I had it in there or not. I don't want to mess up anyone's false sense of security or anything, but if you look at the directions on there, you can see that anyone can still get into your safe. Booo. I look in the closet and see that they had two decent looking robes in there. I guess people get excited about their robes because they left a note on there stating that if the robe was missing that they would charge you $65. I mean, they said it nicer than that but that was the gist. To my surprise though is that the robes had the texture of burlap. WHO WANTS BURLAP BRUSHING THEIR BUTT CHEEKS?! There's not enough booze in the world to make that okay. So fine, no robe, janky safe, iPhone 4 and under compatible alarm clock, and cheap pillows. Oh jeez, we are batting for 100 here. It's a sad moment when you realize that you would have done better at a Holiday Inn. A HOLIDAY INN, PEOPLE! Let that marinate. I would go into what all I felt about the bathroom, but this review is already way too long. All I will say on that is my towels smelled burnt and full of cigarette smoke. It is not the look to feel dirtier AFTER your shower than before. 

Now, I know someone is saying, ""damn she's a princess"", Well, kinda, but I expect more at these prices. If they would have done $65 a night, we could talk, but they want much more for f-all in return. I would say stay somewhere else, but my vote is for you not to go to Vegas at all unless you have a darn good reason for great friends that live there. But if you must, don't stay here unless you want a hot scratchy ass, and if you do, don't forget the bread crumbs so you can find you way back to your room. Also, work on your dodging skills because people will try to get you to book a room in advance for next year. No thanks. 

I guess I should leave on a good note. The customer service was pretty good. There ya go. Yay for you.",4,9,1

I stayed in a room in the North Tower, which is the oldest section of the hotel (first mistake?). The room was small for the price, smelled like mothballs, and looked like it belonged in a retirement home. Stains on the carpet, a mouse in the hall. I tried to upgrade my room to see if that would make me like this place a little better, but the front desk told me they were totally booked. 

The bartender at the casino gave me a cracked glass that I almost cut my lip on. The buffet was cheap, but also greasy, tasteless, and barely edible, and the security guard at the pool was a total douche. Overall the whole place felt dated, tacky, and depressing. The spa was very nice and the staff there were great, but that was pretty much the only aspect of the hotel that I enjoyed at all. Not what I was hoping for!",0,0,0

I love the look, the staff for the most part, the features like restaurants and cafe, and the location.  The rooms are great and the beds are awesome and you get a really clean sense from the rooms and housekeeping is super.
As a non-smoker, I did not love the smokiness in the casino.
I liked the design of the pool area and that I could go outside easily to look for fresh air.  Operative word: look for fresh air.  What the heck: everyone in the Fremont Street area under that overhang smokes, I swear.  There were parents with little children and even young preteen children bringing them into this smoky area, which I would never do.
It is really fun and really cool but the bottom line is that I saw kids coughing, and I was coughing and it seemed so many more smokers were whooping it up in here than in other places.
Having just got over bronchitis it was rather touchy and I cannot say I would look forward to the experience again, which is mainly affected by my relationship with smoke.",0,0,0

It is embarrassing that I gave this place my wedding business and they are not even respectful of that fact.

I have stayed at the Golden Nugget with my family for March Madness every year for the past 8 years but I will be definitely be changing venue next year based on how rude their workers are.

In vegas I'm hardly in the room so I lean towrds the cheaper hotel chains. I could have stayed at a motel 6 for half the price but the awesome pool convinced me to pick the GN. I got a AAA discount which was great! check in was quick and easy and when I asked the young woman to direct me to the nearest place where I could get some juices or drinks she told me to help myself and pointed at a refrigerator they had near checkout with OJ, apple juice, cranberry juice, peanuts and candy! THANKS! the room was very nice and roomy. Our view sucked but hey i dont care too much for those things. We really enjoyed the pool except for the fact that its waaaaaaaay to packed and i learned you have to get there EARLY if you want a chair. however lucky for us some girls nearby left and we jumped on some lounge chairs that were in the pool about 10 minutes after we got there. tube slide is great not too many kids when we were there. I liked that they didnt let locals in as they ask for room key at the door. allows for more room for people who actually pay $$ to stay there since the pool is not that big. We enjoyed being away from the commotion of the strip for a night since freemont street is a bit less hectic. not very many other places i enjoyed going to outside the GN though. gambling is okay a few 24 hr shops and restaurants so that was good. starbucks is convenient too and room service was great!

The man that was checking us into the hotel began to look at us funny and assumed that we just couldn't afford the room. 

I stepped away called the bank and had it resolved in less than 5 minutes. When I got back to the check in line the man helping us, appeared to look flustered with me. So he ran the card and it worked fine and with a rude remark by him ""It went through"" with an attitude. I didn't mind because I was just excited to be there.

We get to the room it's practically sitting on air conditioners. We have a prefect view of the air conditioning units for the hotel through the smallest window ever made. 

Wow. I couldn't believe this .... I was upset with the mans attitude towards me. I was upset that they had put us on such a low floor.

This is the nicest property on Freemont street by far in my opinion. The staff are extremely nice and helpful and seem to want to do good by you if you give them the chance. There are plenty of gaming tables and machines and the casino is very clean. The rooms are really nothing fancy, but given the cheaper price I wont complain. All of the meals we had were very good and we appreciated that we could walk from casino to casino on Freemont within a short period of time. The bad part of Freemont street is don't be surprised if your bum rushed by someone looking for a handout or trying to get you to listen to their sales pitch. Simply say no and walk away and perhaps they will stop doing it. The number one complaint we have with the casino floor is their comp policy that they have recently put in place regarding free drinks at the bar. They have an indicator on the bartender side of the screen that tells them if you are playing enough to deserve a free beer or drink. Although I understand a lot of folks take advantage of this perk and simply play a nickle through the machine to get a freebie It just seems seedy and tacky to me. I play plenty and have no problem with them giving me whatever I want, but it just don't like it. Regarding the high drink prices and coffee being $20 for 4 Kuereg cups be advised there is a Walgreens two blocks down on Freemont street. There you can get 12 Kuereg cups for $15 and, yes, they work in the coffee maker in the room. Also pick yourself up a Styrofoam, cooler there for a few bucks. You can chill your beer in it plus creamer if you get some thus no paying $5 for a bottle of beer there if you don't gamble much. They have clear plastic cups at all of the doorways for pouring your drink into before venturing out on Freemont so grab a few and take them to your room. There are liquor stores on both sides of the property on Freemont as well. Get your fruit juice and liquor there for your room and your clear cups to save money as well. Lastly be sure to get a players card when you get there for the casino as they usually give you some free play on it for joining. Use this card while you play and see the casino host before you check out to apply your credit to the room costs. It took me the second trip to get it down but we had a great time there and didn't break the bank. We are going back again soon!",0,0,0

These are nice rooms, nicely appointed and much better than the normal room.  They're on a floor only accessed on the elevator by a Gold Club key.  Some of the perqs are coffee in the morning and great snacks like nuts and chocolate covered raisins in the afternoon\/evening.  
And there lies the problem.  We checked in at 4, got to our room, checked the snacks and discovered that of the 4 bowls, three had been cleaned out (like someone with a big plastic bag had come by and taken everything).  Plus their complimentary water bottles were gone.
We couldn't go to sleep that early since our room overlooked the Fremont St. Experience and ""Born To Be Wild"" was blasting away during the midnight show right  below us.  So when I went to get the morning coffee -- nothing.  No coffee, no juice, no bottles of water.  I went down to the VIP office where the woman said they put it out at 6 (it was now 8:30).  Great!

The Good:
I stayed in the Rush Tower, which the GN site calls ""new"". It was either just built or renovated because the rooms were very up to date, very nice, and very big. The bathroom was awesome and now my wife wants one like it. The bed was comfortable and the rest of the room was very clean.
Vic and Anthony's is a high end steak & lobster restaurant with incredible food and an impressive stock of top shelf Scotches. Just be sure to have deep pockets. Dinner for 2 plus drinks came to about $120.
The Grotto is a mid range Italian restaurant with a good menu, a good wine list and a view of the pool. Moderate price, good food.
Red Sushi located next to the casino floor is a good place to get some hand crafted sushi and roles while people watching. Comfortable but a little loud because it is open to the casino.
Both pools were clean, well maintained although neither had a view of anything except the hotel.
The hotel\/casino complex is small when compared to monsters like the MGM, which I like since it is easier to navigate, quicker to get to my room if I need something without having to walk past a dozen overpriced shops no one buys anything at, and it has very quick access to Fremont Street from the casino. 

The Bad:
No free wifi. Its 2014 people, get over it! I can get free wifi on a freak'n airplane I think I should be able to get some wifi at a mid-level Las Vegas casino.
I wouldn't have known it was there if I hadn't asked, but there is one bar near Fremont street in the casino that has been designated the International Beer Bar. It isn't on the maps or website, only has a moderate selection and the staff wasn't knowledgeable enough. If you have that name and say you have 40 beers but include terrible domestic beers or super common imports like Becks, you aren't really doing anyone any favors. If the IBB doesn't stock a German Doppelbock they should at least know what it is (not that uncommon) and if they stock Belgian Trappist beers like Chimay Blue and I ask for a Quad, you should know that will work.
I also had mixed luck with the bars. The Rush Bar made me a Godfather cocktail no problem. The H2O bar at the pool had no idea what it was, called someone to find out, and still got it wrong.
Speaking of which the H20 bar is at the pool that closes @ 8pm. The Hideaway Pool on the third floor for adults is open to 2am, but doesn't have a bartender after 8pm. Kinda lame. So your options are to get out dripping wet and go down two levels to get a drink, or hope that a girl collecting towels comes around every 30 minutes and is willing to take a drink order (which they then get wrong.)

The Golden Nugget feels like it might be in transition. They want to go upscale, and offer a whole lot of bang for a pretty good price, with some nice amenities, but fall just short of getting it perfect. If they offer the right services when they should be offered and get their barmen up to speed, I'd say the place was perfect.",0,1,1

Now I love Downtown Vegas over the Strip. I am not a millionaire, a Kardashian, an Orange County Housewife, or any other kind of B celebrity, nor am I delusional to think that if I hang out at the Cosmo I might become one of those. Plus it smells like Drakar in there, which makes me what to punch people in the face.

I like the idea of old school Vegas...Down town...kind of seedy, free drinks, $5 crap tables.... People with missing digits, missing limbs, really bad outfits, 80's hair and eye patches....
It's AMAZING... 

Freemont Street is so wrong it's right!
It's as if Disneyland and San Francisco's Tenderloin had a baby...
It's dingy, sparkly, fascinating and horrifying all at the same time.
The Bon Jovi light show can only be toped by the Queen light show.
And if you are lucky, you can ZIP LINE the length of 
Freemont St., during it!  WHAT??!!

Definitely pay the extra $ for the ADULT only pool.

Traveling alone on personal business (summer 2011) I stayed in the Rush Tower and was impressed with the room for such a reasonable price. The Nugget's recent remodeling was evident in the casino's fresh decor and updated look, the room was comfortable, quiet and offered a nice view. The bathroom and shower weren't gross. 

Service from the hotel staff and front desk was mixed on my stay. I guess they can't read the 'Do Not Disturb' sign. Don't attempt to call the front desk they don't pickup. The internet service was wired and getting logged on was a bit of a mystery. Room service was good but food was outrageously expensive. Don't look for a coffee pot in the room, there is none, so expect to wait in long lines at the Starbucks in the lobby or hit downtown on foot. Finally, my late check out was not communicated to maid service. 

Regarding location, the free parking garage is convenient to the hotel but located on the wrong side of the building, the GPS got lost and so did I. Downtown Vegas doesn't bring the allure and attraction of the Strip, but the Nugget is very convenient to Fremont street's 'experience'. Several bars and clubs have opened downtown so there's bit more to do than just sit in a casino. The neighboring casino's, however, are pretty much garbage and not recommended.

The Nugget's huge pool, shark tank, restaurant are cool attractions, the property and amenities are impressive. The attached upscale steakhouse gets good reviews but I didn't hit on my brief stay. Gaming tables were fine, signage and directions around the casino and hotel are weak - meaning you really have to look for them. Minimums are lower downtown and I know the slots are cheaper and known to payoff more than the Strip.

If you're looking for that Old Vegas feel while not having to compromise on luxury at a reasonable price, the Nugget is worth checking out.",2,0,0

First vacation for my wife and I in over two years, we had a couples massage booked for the morning of my birthday that Golden Nugget cancelled due to the couples massage room betting flooded (or the ceiling having caved in depending on who we talked to). We understand these thing happen, so no biggie. Asked the front desk what they could do to make things right, seeing as how this had all been planned and paid for over two months in advance and we got 3 days notice on the cancellation, we were given the extension number for the spa director (who was half-way across the country in Biloxi) and told to leave her a voice mail. When we complained on the Golden Nugget Facebook page we were given an email address for the same individual. Shameful customer service making the customer call\/email somebody who isn't on-site to help at the time. 

Just a tip for any Golden Nugget representatives who read these reviews, a customer who feels they've been wronged generally won't complain unless they feel really strongly about it. If they do go to the trouble of complaining, please listen to and address their concerns rather than giving them a phone number or email address of somebody else so they can handle it. The only time you should give a complaining customer a name, phone number and email for somebody else is if they ask for it. Otherwise, take care of their concerns and they may be a customer for life rather than go to the trouble of writing bad reviews of your hotel on Facebook, Yelp, Yahoo, etc.

***UPDATE***

I received an email reply from Ms. Taylor, the spa director.

First and foremost check in.  Last year was an awful experience.  This year Jacob was so pleasant, informative and seemingly happy to be dealing with us.  He easily and without pressure sold us an upgraded room, to which we became very appreciative as time went on. An A for Jacob!

Our room was on the 23rd floor.  Nice view, which we were hoping the upgrade would give us.  The room was as spacious, well decorated and impressive as we remembered it.  It probably isn't as nice, nor as big overall as the rooms at Encore (where we went after our GN stay) but it is the same class all the way! It gets an A!

The Hotel as well as all of Downtown seem to be improving rapidly!

One of my big concerns last year was the pool and while 
I still have issues it was better.

It appears they are addressing the raiders from the other hotels downtown by checking keys.  But it still seems they are offering local families incentives or something as the families and couples were everywhere.  Now I didn't check everyone of course, lol.  But I did strike up enough conversations from which I form my opinion.  Further, the big, unsmiling and intimidating bouncer checking the room keys ALWAYS checked my key but I noticed two groups of folks about his age go through  ahead of me with very 'familiar' conversation taking place.  Hmmm.  Also, there is an unguarded door by one of the restaurants that was used quite extensively by folks.

The pool is still very dirty by the end of the day but is clean by the next morning.  All of than sun tan lotion and in and out to the slide is hopefully the culprit.

Lastly the adult pool seemed like a bad joke.  They charge 16.00 a chair, needing reservations.  Fair enough.  But the place looked MORE crowded than the regular pool, lol!  The only difference was the lack of kids.  Seems like a better idea to make it more exclusive even if that means charging more.

In closing, the staff still has it's share of grumpy Gus's - the attendant at the spa who didn't even care a little about discussing massage options for my wife with me and he even argued with me aggressively about some meaningless point (???) -but there were more than a few really pleasant staff members (like Jacob) and that attitude goes a long way.

The buffets here aren't cheap, but the food selection, especially for the Sunday Brunch, was impressive.

That is just a myth.  [Vegas vacations are too short to spend three hours of them walking up and down the strip and convincing yourself that that is entertainment.  Ugh!]

Instead, what you need to do is to come over to the Golden Nugget on Fremont Street.  You'll be glad you did.  

The pros:

The pool ~ really liked it.  The Hideout ~ quit grumbling when the host tells you that there is a cost to this place.  It is worth it!  Very casual, exclusive, much quieter than the pool, with excellent poolside service.  Note to GN:  promote that cute and friendly waitress Cindy!  The slide ~ free, fast and fun.  The shark tank ~ very cool.  The loose slots ~ I had to do a few victory laps around them.  Note to GN casino manager:  Please never ever ever take away those older penny slot Progressive Blazing Sevens with the symbols that take over the machine if you get three or more with the max bet of $1.25  Those are my FAVORITE SLOTS.   Plus, the cocktail waitress came around with plenty of free drinks.  The spa ~ expensive, but let me tell you, Sally can do your hair in style! The hotel room was fine, clean and pretty much what we requested.  

The cons:  The entrances aren't electric so you have to touch the germy door handle to enter.  I forgave them because, well, I mean, you know, I slowed down and made Ed open the door for me, plus I figured less rennovations = kinder slots.  And it did ~ woot!  There was no ramp to get into the lobby from the outside at our entrance.  This would make it difficult for somebody in a scooter or wheelchair.  Once in the lobby, there was a ramp into the hotel \/ casino area.  The carpet is very loud everywhere.

I have had to stay here twice now for a competition and have been very happy with both stays. You would be completely entertained for several days without needing a car to go to the strip.

Pros:
- large rooms, ice machines, big bathrooms and closet
- elevators are quick and convenient, not crowded
- tons of food options, the buffet is very reasonably priced
- the ballroom for events is convenient and large
- parking for guests is free
- walkability along Fremont St. is great and entertaining

Cons:
- no easy, cheap way to get off of Fremont St.
- the pool was slammed in the summer; wall-to-wall people
- no free coffee (machine) in the room",3,0,0

Really wanted to like this hotel as it is a favorite of my parents.  Not sure how it got a 4 diamond review with worn carpet, tired room decorations (and we were in one of the 'upgraded' pool view rooms) - and one of the best - pay $10 for the pod coffee in your room.....Skip the $25 VIP check in too.  On the phone, we were told it included not waiting in line to check in or the buffet and access to the spa for basic things like the sauna - but upon arrival, that was not the case.  Front desk and check in people both on the phone and in person seem to be a bit flippant - not at all the customer service you usually receive at a '4 diamond' location.

We had been together as a group of 8 people eating at all sorts of restaurants on the strip - then down to 4, having stayed downtown at Bally's and then our last 3 nights at Golden Nugget.  We all ate together at the buffet - nothing fancy but great service and great selection of food based on the price - also had a really great meal at the Italian restaurant inside of the Golden Nugget.  On Tuesday night, my girlfriend and I ate at Lilly's the Asian restaurant and had fantastic service and great food.  On Wednesday night, when we returned and got our vegetable rolls and Pad Thai to go, it was also great at 10:30 pm, but at 2:30am, that's when the trouble started.  My girlfriend was hit first with vomiting and diarrhea then it hit me 30 minutes later.  Lots of fun with only 1 bathroom.  I thought we were going to die - and this went on for hours.  When I could finally pick up the phone and report this to the front desk, I let them know what was happening, because we certainly wouldn't want anyone else to go through this.  I asked if someone could send up ice, water and 7 up which I thought might help with the constant and non-stop vomiting and diarrhea.  They acted like we were drunk or hung over (I think we each had a beer that day) which I'm sure they get a lot - but explosive vomit and diarrhea.  About 40 minutes later, room service showed up with a $38 charge for 3 small bottles of water and 7up in a carafe watered down with ice.  I signed the slip in desperation for some relief and thought we would deal with it later.  

Front desk had told us we would need to do an incident report, but the thought of looking or talking to anyone was too much until  finally by Thursday night, we thought we could keep it together long enough to have security up in the room to do the report.  He apologized profusely and was wonderful, and when we told him about the room service charge, he said that was definitely something that should not have happened.  He said he would turn in the report and because it was the weekend, we probably wouldn't hear from anyone until Monday.

Monday, Tuesday - finally on Wednesday we called and here is the response we received from Richard Smith, claiming to be the manger of risk management of all Golden Nuggets.

By the way, we were only asking to have the room charge reversed.  As a courtesy, they should also have reversed at least one of the room nights.  Nothing doing  - without proof - just our word against his.  We calmly mentioned we owned a restaurant and knew the importance of safe food handling and that given the rapid onset of these symptoms and that NO ONE ELSE in our group had these symptoms, it was from something that was contaminated, cross contaminated and \/ or someone didn't wash their hands.  Without a doctor's report, nothing he could do.  I mentioned we were basically trapped in our room and couldn't leave, we missed two shows we had paid for on Thursday  night, and reversing room service charge seemed like a reasonable request as did reversing one room night.  Nope.  Not without a fecal sample.  So while I am finally feeling back to usual as of yesterday - nearly 7 complete days later - my girlfriend is still not feeling well.  I asked if I could speak with someone else as I really could not believe this was his stance and he said no - he was it.   He actually said that we should have gotten the water, ice and 7up ourselves, which I replied we had thought was a really bad idea since we couldn't stop the bodily fluids from coming out both ends and thought that would be bad going up and down the hallways.   I calmly told him I would definitely be escalating this and writing on line reviews warning others about this horrific customer service and I was told to be careful, they take liable very seriously.......",2,0,0

I have to agree, mainly because I've never felt any sketchy vibes radiating from this place. That or it was the bright lighting or the large fish tank by the check-in desk at the Rush Tower. I don't know, but I didn't have my, ""I feel like I'm going to get kidnapped and sold into a circus"" feeling.

ROOM
Checked into the Rush Tower King and was pleased with the contemporary decor in both bathroom and bedroom areas. I think what excited me the most was the fact that my room actually had a couch, which I didn't even sit on. There's a DVD player and flat panel television with hardly any channels worth watching. Interesting to note how each time I turned on my television, the first thing I saw were advertisements for ordering the naughty channels. Nice try, Golden Nugget, but I don't think so. Maybe on someone else's credit card.  It was a challenge trying to find the electrical outlets because they're hidden throughout the room and just difficult to get to if you have short arms. There is a row that's hidden in the writing desk that I was lucky to find. As for the view, well, I kept my curtains shut for the most part. My room, which was located on the 25th floor, overlooked the eastern part of the Vegas valley and the beautiful dirt-stained rooftops of several surrounding buildings.

The bed was nice and comfy and free of any questionable stains, which is always a plus. Bathtub's slippery, but fortunately the bathroom is equipped with one of those rubber mats with the suction cups that you can place on the floor of the tub. 

One of my biggest complaints about this room is its lighting fixtures. Whoever was the interior decorator tried too hard in attempting to create a ""sexy"" ambiance by omitting as much lighting as possible, that or GN needs to change the light bulbs. 

ROOM SERVICE
For the first and perhaps the last time in my life, I ordered room service since I was in a rush trying to get ready for a party. I ordered the All-American BLT with a side of fries. If you order room service, you will be charged a $5 service fee with state tax. This doesn't include gratuity, so heads up on that. The sandwich was OK, and it could've been easily shared with another person. But truthfully, I think that the cafe inside of Fry's Electronics makes a better version.

POOL
Didn't go swimming due to qualms I have about swimming in community pools, and also the possibility of getting hit by lightning on the evening I visited. If anything, check out The Tank -- a large aquarium with several sharks and schools of fish. Be sure to visit during the evening hours, because just like everything in Vegas: it looks better at night. 

OTHER
Unfortunately, I didn't  witness the Homeless Drug Addict Soul Train Dance Contest that Jaime W. was fortunate enough to have seen, but I did briefly observe other characters like Ass-Less Chaps Cowboy -- he was wearing red manties or just had a really bad sunburn --  pose for photos with Asian tourists.

I wanted to check out The Grotto, but I wasn't able to during my visit. Instead, I did hit up Carson Street Cafe which was just meh (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/carson-street-cafe-las-vegas#hrid:O2AUGCo8T2YTO1GGJqneKg).

OVERALL
Checking into a room at GN, especially at the Rush Tower, is worth the price in comparison to hotels on The Strip and in Downtown. It's one of the better ones to stay in, and it's easily accessible to Fremont Street and other tourist attractions. Just be sure to bring a couple of flashlights.",3,6,2

However, Yelpers steered me toward making reservations for GN's new Gold Rush rooms and I was not at all disappointed! 

From the moment we stepped foot onto the 24th floor (using keycards only given to those staying in Gold Rush rooms), I felt at home. In the elevator foyer, there are snacks waiting for you -- peanut m&ms, nuts, raisins, apples, and bottled water, a luxury in the desert. In the AM, there are fruit, nuts and plenty of bottled water. 

The rooms were simply put, amazing. You could tell that a lot of thought went into the design. The bathrooms featured double sinks, a shower with a double shower head and partially opened designed, separate toilet room, and gorgeous sliding doors. There were complimentary robes in the closet as well as the standard complimentary items -- iron, board, toiletries (found in the bathroom). Also, complimentary wi-fi that worked well. 

Our room featured a king size bed that was a dream to sleep on. The sheets were crisp and white and nicely tucked. The room came with a view of the strip that was stunning at night -- it really felt like we were on top of the Vegas world!

Spa access is included with the Gold Rush rooms. The spa area is older but clean for the most part and attended by courteous staff. 

Didn't get to gamble but did try a couple of the restaurants. Highly recommend getting lunch (it's cheaper!) at Chart House, which features a larger than life fish tank. If you're lucky, you'll get to see the divers cleaning out the tank. 

The buffet is a MUST. Go for breakast, brunch, lunch, dinner whatever. An absolute steal for the delicious food they serve.

I expected something decent - the casino itself is quite nice for being an older property downtown. This was the most crowded uncomfortable sportsbook! The rows of seats are two deep and start just a few feet from the wall so your neck is cranked so badly looking up to see the screens - it's like the front row at the movie theater. The seat backs are so low you can't rest your head on them to lean back either. Every time someone needed to get by you they were tripping over your feet.

And the center section the walls are so high on the booths that is was hard to see over them and those chairs were not very comfy either. There were restaurant style booths in the back of the room near the bar - maybe they were ok, but they were filled up so I could say. The screens were all small too!

No waitress ever came over to ask if we wanted drinks. Had an obnoxious group behind us who kept literally yelling out ""grab her by the pussy"" and ""F....You"". In some places they would have been asked to leave - but not here. Miserable experience.

They say it will take 5 min from the service room and I'm waiting and sleeping because somebody decided no to do their job....,
Not that I'm planing to change my review for better but for worse if I could give them minus 5 stars I would.
Today they miss the cleaning room which it's fine everyone makes a bubu once in a while but to call them and the receptionist Nicky assured me they would come and fixed right away and not happening and have to call them once again at 1:30am it's ridiculous.
Shame on you Golden Nuggets and make sure every time somebody ask me about your service it's going to be a bad review.

We stopped into Golden Nugget to get out of the heat and into some delicious drinks.

This place seems to have undergone a makeover a bit since the last time I was here.  The dealers weren't wearing cowboy hats and western shirts anymore (perhaps that was somewhere else though..my memory of Vegas visit is hazy at best).  The place was nice yet not overwhelmingly posh like some of the other casinos.

We ended up in the bar Rush which turned out to be super fun with a live band, guest singers like the Elvis guy, and drunk tourists dancing.  It was a good unexpected time and I wished I could have stayed longer instead of going to bed early for a work conference.  Why companies think having conferences in Vegas is a good idea I will never know...no one is awake during the meeting, everyone is bleary eyed hungover and falling asleep while sitting up.  I digress.

Definitely a legendary place on Freemont.  You must visit the Golden Nugget casino at least once on a trip to Vegas.",2,1,3

I accidentally left something in the room. I called to get it sent back and agreed to pay for the price of shipping. I was charged $30 for them to put it in a USPS flat rate box.

My job sometimes requires me to travel to Vegas, and the Nugget is the closest hotel to our facility, so that's where I usually stay.  Our CFO likes the prices, too.

First of all, I must say that ""The Tank"" (aka the shark pool and slide) are pretty cool, and despite the problems they had during the first week, there's no signs of water leaking out anymore.

The water slide is pretty darn awesome.  I was amazed at how fast you get going, with acceleration happening both forward and laterally.

One of my old complaints, that the lobby and everywhere was smoky, seems to have been addressed.  They either upgraded the ventilation system, or then the recent laws on smoking in public places have had some effect.  Either way, it's not as stinky or smelly as it used to be, but it's clearly not the Wynn either.

The Starbucks are (they have two now) overpriced - I've never paid $2.50 for a tall coffee in Manhattan, so what's their excuse?  The buffet was decent, but nothing to write home about.  Their other eateries are pretty average as well.

If you're coming to Vegas and want to stay in downtown Las Vegas for a night or two, or want a 4 star (though I would argue it's more like 3) hotel for under $100\/night, give the Nugget a try.  It's clearly the best hotel in the downtown area, but far below the best that the Strip has to offer.",1,0,0

Places on the strip such as MGM Grand, MGM Signature, Paris, NYNY are waaaaaaay better. compare to normal 4 star such as the westin chain, grand HYATT, Fairmont, this place still sux. nothing exciting happens on Fremont St.

here are the run downs:
* valet is super slow and it was 100 degree out there.
* the fish tank pool sounds cool, but the lady at the gate was mean about the fact I didn't have a key because my roomate took my key and went in there early. when hanging at the pool, there were so many kids kept splashing water at us. when we moved, they followed us.
* the room is small, small bath room, small bed (smaller than a full in the double room, not sure what size are those). 
* no frig. 
* lighting in the room was dim, which made it hard for a group of us girls to get ready.
* the TV remote didn't work half of the time, I couldn't check out using that stupid TV remote. 
* if you call front desk, expect a long wait.
* food is like Danny's at the general cafe, there are restaurants that look nicer, but we rather go eat elsewhere.
* our sink was plugged up and they never came to fix it. when we complained to the front desk, they offered us another room, but didn't offer to help us move or anything.  
* the general ambiance of the place just reminds me of Reno, nothing Vegas about it.
* the crowd here isn't older, the crowd here is mid-aged to re-tired ppl. 

so my advice is, the place is clean and what not. but don't expect it to be nice, the double tree is nicer. maybe it's nicer than a best western. you really do get what you pay for, so don't be fooled by the nice reviews. I will not stay here again, not even when I'm old.",3,1,1

For this year NAB I had a good deal to stay here through Orbitz so I decided to try it. It turned out to be a bit more an adventure than I was expecting. Arriving late Saturday\/early Sunday a the airport, it was about 2 am when I came to check-in. The attendant did look up my reservation and seemed a bit embarrassed. She asked me to wait a bit and disappeared in an office for about 10 minutes. She then came back apologizing saying that they were overbooked and had no room available despite my confirmed and prepaid reservation. They proposed me to send me (at their expenses) to the Bellagio (a much more upscale hotel on the strip) for the night, pay me back my night and upgrade me for the remaining nights. The arrangement was good, I think they did well in face of a bad situation. Off course it was annoying to have to go to another hotel that late and then to move hotel again the next day but it was appreciated that they did put me in such a nice hotel for that night.

The room that I got for the remaining days is in the ""Golden Tower"" and is actually quite nice with full amenities. It's comfortable and allows for a good night sleep. The room decor seems a bit dated, not sure if it's on purpose and targets a different audience.

(Which confuses me because Vegas is not for kids, I mean there are naked pictures of strippers all over the ground when you step out on Freemont St or go to the strip)...

If you cannot afford to drop $1,600 for the strip I would say the GN is one of the nicer places on Freemont to stay. 
Cab rides to the strip are $20 bucks
Cab ride from the airport to the hotel is $30, but if you catch a shuttle I think it was $25ish for two people

If I could do it over again: Stay one night at Caesar's Palace and call it a day.

I checked into the Golden Nugget, and couldn't have been more happy. For about $15 more a night, the difference was staggering! 

First, the casino, lobby and elevators have been beautifully restored, and are clean and fresh smelling. The check-in staff was not overtly friendly, but still very polite and respectful. The offer of bellboy service was made, but in the age of rolling luggage, who needs that!

I wasn't expecting much from my Gold Tower room, but was delighted to see how spacious and luxurious it was! Amazingly comfortable bed, nice furniture, giant flat-panel television, mini-safe for valuables, etc. The entry area was marbled, with the balance of the room carpeted. Everything was immaculately clean, and the room was fresh smelling but not laden with cleaning chemicals or disinfectant. The bathroom was smallish (hey, this is a very old building) but again, it was beautifully restored...marble tile, elegant sink\/counter, shower with curved curtain rod and great water pressure, etc. The commode seemed to be rocket powered! WiFi internet access was a bit pricey at $12.95 a day, but it worked well and was very speedy. Now none of this was a fluke, as each of my three friends had rooms that were virtually identical.

If I had to say anything negative about the room, it would be that sound isolation is not terribly good. It's not that I could hear people through the walls, but sounds in the hallway (doors slamming, people walking, etc.) definitely seemed quite loud. Again, this probably just goes with the territory in an older building. No big deal.

That evening my friends and I took a quick dip in the pool, and had fun swimming up within inches of the giant fish and sharks in the central aquarium. It was fascinating to be so close to these beautiful animals. Afterwards we soaked in the jacuzzi for an hour or so, to unwind before going out to dinner. The pool staff was attentive and helpful...lots of clean, high quality towels were provided, and the wait staff was quick to bring drinks around.

We spent a fair amount of time in two Nugget bars, I wish I could remember the name of them. The first has a large balcony that hangs out over Fremont Street, and it's a great spot to do a little ""people watching."" The second is a circular arrangement with the bar in the middle, and it had the most amazing band playing there. Just four piece (guitar, keyboardist\/vocalist, drums, bass) but they sounded huge, their level of musicianship was tremendous and the singer really knew how to work a crowd.

Honestly, I had no idea that downtown Vegas had a hotel of this caliber! When traveling for work, I usually stay at the Bellagio. Now the Nugget is no Bellagio, but you know what...it's really not too far behind! Anyhow, I definitely recommend this hotel to anybody who wishes to enjoy the ""old school"" Fremont Street scene.",0,0,0

The girl who was working the table at the time (who was a sweetheart) mistakenly removed chips on the table that shouldn't have been moved. Apparently, when the wheel gets stuck between numbers, there needs to be a re-spin. Understandable, but it took about 30 minutes before finally getting a response on what would happen with our bets. Instead of giving us our winnings for landing on 40 (which I feel would've been the right thing to do since it had clearly passed the prior number), a woman named SHIRLEY(or so I was told) who was wearing a blue coat (which I assume means she's some sort of manager\/supervisor) came over and tried to place less $$ on our previous bets then we had actually placed. When we told her those weren't the right amounts, she got a very rude attitude and basically ripped us off of what we should've won\/bet.

The girls working the table were great, polite, and helpful. It's that ""Shirley"" woman wearing a blue coat who made this experience one star worthy. We were having a great time and would've spent the rest of our night spending money there until that happened. Now I will avoid that casino thanks to her.

We had originally wanted to stay on the strip but, due to two large conventions, had to stay downtown. In hindsight, I'm glad we did. I researched Tripadvisor.com and noticed that the Golden Nugget had some pretty good reviews (the new Rush tower in particular). I am happy to say that the Rush tower did not disappoint. 

Room: Elegantly modern rooms, great room rate and a very good night's sleep. If you are willing to spend a few dollars more, per night, upgrade your room to the Rush Tower. It's worth it. The beds are very comfortable. The rooms are very quiet (we stayed on the 16th floor with a strip view). 

Food: My wife and I dined at Lillie's Asian Cuisine, The Buffet, the Grille and Grotto. 
Lillie's was pretty good. I had the General Tso chicken and my wife had the Kung Po chicken. Both were flavorable but the General Tso was better...I reccomend it. 
On Monday, we had lunch at Grotto. This was very good. The Golden Nugget got a 4-star review from me, based on Grotto and the quality of our room. I had the Spinach-Pear salad and my wife had the grilled chicken and marinara sandwhich. Both plates were excellent. The Breakfast Buffet was pretty good. Nice warm plates and delicious omlettes. Out of all the places we dined in Golden Nugget, Grotto was, by far, the best.

Overall, we liked the Golden Nugget and we will stay here again. The location is not near the strip. That is the ONLY reason why I did not give this establishment 5-stars. 

At night, we mainly gambled and hung out in the lounges downstairs. We watched the Freemont Street experience as well as the assorted bands, performers, costumed people and overall freak-parade. Never a dull moment at night on the Freemont!! We wanted to go party at Gold Diggers but didn't get a chance to.",1,0,0

The front desk didn't seem to care that we did not get what we asked for and when making the reservation, like most of you know have to pay for your 1st night. Well just because you paid your 1st night that does not give you what you paid for. Was told since we checked in after 10 that is why the nonsmoking rooms are gone, due to people coming and renting rooms. WOW really?  Was placed on the 2nd floor in the gold tower and was placed in a room with a great view of the back of Golden Nugget sign on for Freemont st,,,,yea that rocked.     The staff was unfriendly and not very helpful. It felt like the ""if you don't like it you can leave"" attitude was displayed by the entire staff.

My stay started out good, and went well the whole time.

Check-in was a breeze in the Rush tower except for walking in and not being able to find the front desk. I asked where it was and the security pointed straight ahead. It was right in front of me. I just didnt notice because there was nobody at all in line!
The check in clerk was really nice and put us in a room away from Fremont because it can get loud in the rooms facing that direction. We got our keys and headed up to our room which was very convenient to the casino floor.

The room was very nice. Classy dark color scheme in the bathrooms, a nice L-shaped leather couch and a really comfy bed. It was spacious and VERY clean. Not hotel room-wiped down but still skeezy feeling clean. Clean. The tv worked great and had about 20 HD channels. There was 4 cups of Keurig coffee and a machine. The cups are $10 for four. That is less than you will pay in the casino folks....

We had a nice view looking out towards the strip, even the windows were clean. We also got to see a guy get searched by the police in front of the bus station which was good for a laugh.

The casino itself is great with all kinds of new slots, cheap minimums on table games (or at least on roulette since thats what I play). There are some fancier bars and restaurants and also some cheaper stuff. 

I had a fantastic drink at the Ice Bar. The bartender there really takes pride in his job. I had something with vodka and jalapenos. He mixed it up, tasted it by taking a little out with a straw and threw it away!!!! I guess it didnt meet his strict standards. He immediately mixed another and tasted it again. He pronounced that one fit to drink and handed it to me. It was really awesome. Had a nice jalapeno burn but not overpowering. I actually felt it was worth the $12.

They also give you a coupon book upon check in and it has lots of great deals, make sure to use it. Even free drinks in some places!

Casino action:
This is a classy place... people are in the casino to have a little bit of heart throbbing excitement. Drinks come if you stick to a table and overall the casino is a pleasant experience. Even the way the place smells is much better than some if you are an anti cigarette smoke kind of person.

Rooms:
Very good looking rooms. They may not be the largest in all of Vegas but they sure are well done - sort of like the Bellagio - not the biggest but what is there was lookin good.

Best buffet value in all of Vegas:
I will stand behind this claim I make. First off, the space is beautiful. Comfortable seating - even with armrests so you can really settle in and get your money's worth. Views of the shark tank and pool and all the half naked people there baking in the desert sun. The food: not the largest variety in Vegas or necessarily the fanciest or most exotic food but what is there is of good quality. The smaller selection and not having an endless counter I think is what really works in favor here - less food variety means more turnover of food and better freshness. BTW the ""world famous"" bread pudding is the best I've ever had. 1\/2 is bread layer... the other 1\/2 is pudding. Save room for dessert. $14 breakfast $15 lunch $21 dinner.... Part of the good value is no hour long waits ahmmm Buffet Bellagio.

Awesome pool:
Mentioned a bit already above in 'buffet' section. This new addition really makes staying at this hotel special. You can't miss the pool - you will walk past from the parking garage and you will see it from the buffet. 

I would say the best hotel in all of downtown. Nostalgic, cool... clean, classy. Still, that might not be what your after. If your main purpose of a Vegas vacation is bragging about your hotel on Facebook I would recommend Mandalay Bay or Winn instead.",4,1,0

Celebrated our daughters 21st bday and everyone there was really cool, all of the staff she came across wished her a happy BD. Overall, cleanest and nicest hotel on Fremont Street and even cooler than some we've been to on the strip!",1,0,0

The water slide through the shark tank sold us!  Overall, I agree that this place has the potential to be a really nice hotel. It has the location central to the Fremont Street Experience and convenient to the Big Bus Tour and other shuttles. It has fairly decent sized, updated rooms. It reminded us a lot of being on the cruise we took recently.  However, for every upside, there was a downside which has me still wondering if I'd return.  

We'd researched the best deals through places like Orbitz, hotels.com and groupons even and decided to go straight through the hotel site to book our room with 2 double beds for 3 people. We specifically told them we'd be checking in late and called to confirm - they assured me it'd be no problem. When we got there around 10:30pm we were told that there were no more rooms with 2 double beds so the 3 of us (pretty much all 3 of us are adult size) would have to sleep on a king-size bed.  When we got to the room, the toilet seat was wet - and not flushed - and there was a rubber glove between the desk and the wall that hopefully was from the cleaning crew.  While I understand that there was a big ball tournament in town which causes higher stress for all working at the hotel to turn over things quickly, I thought that was the reason for reservations.  The hotel did say that we could check the next day to see if a room wtih a king-bed was available - which it was.
While we paid the resort fee and totally appreciated the free water (although it was confusing because the water had a tag saying they'd charge us for it but apparently those signs are for people who don't pay the resort fee which I didn't realize was an optional thing), the thought of having to pay another $10 for coffee in my room wasn't cool. What hotel EVER has ever made you pay for coffee in your room?  While the resort fee covered free internet - I don't believe wifi was an option.

The pool and the huge tank in the middle is SO cool to look at and swim around and such.  The wait isn't long for going down the slide and I was impressed that they had a lot of life guards posted.  My daughter and I did have a fun few hours in the pool. The crowd at the pool kinda shifted with the sun and having the gambling tables right by the pool was fun to watch.  The pool itself had a lot of hair in it.  While that's just yucky feeling, I still wondered why this wasn't being caught by some super-sized filter that one should have when having a pool that size.  

The last thing that happened was that our daughter's phone got left in the room and we're 95% sure it was in the room that morning because we barely woke up, did a mini Easter egg hunt in the room and got ready to check out. I did call the hotel and the communication between housekeeping and security was a bit clunky. So, we returned to the room ourselves and gave it another once over re-checking under the bed and between the bed and the headboard (where we'd managed to lose and then find the remote) and saw the gal who actually cleaned out our room.  It just seemed like I was getting canned answers and not truthful or helpful responses.  Plus there isn't a connected network in place to find the phone. Since my ""incident"" was tied to the specific room, I also called in a few days later to report the loss more in general so if anyone happened to turn it in - if it fell out on our way to the elevator or something, then either way it would be covered.
Overall, the staff was ok, but a few front desk folks had attitudes that I would expect to find in Beverly Hills or on the Strip VIP but not on Fremont Street. I will say, when I found the other check out tower in front of the huge fish tank - they were a GREAT example of what front-desk workers should be and do.

Our Three thumb review is 1 1\/2 thumbs up. My 10-year old daughter can't wait to go back. My 14-year old son liked the hotel but wasn't a fan of the pool and was a little let down that they didn't have wifi.  I'm not necessarily eager to go back at this point. It'd have to be one heck of a Vegas deal to get me to visit their hotel again. At this point, I'm thinking that there are so many different types of place to stay, why not explore my options.

I recently stayed in the Rush Tower. My room was very contemporary. 1 very cozy King, made up in crisp clean white cotton. There was a nice leather chaise sofa, big entertainment wall with a 42"" flat screen and a separate CD component. A bonus for me since I happen to carry a small collection of my favorite CD's everywhere I go.  

The bathroom was really nice. Contemporary. Rich, deep browns contrasting with a big, white rectangular ceramic sink and huge matching bath tub. It fits two average sized people perfectly ;) The glass doors on the shower and on the doors leading into the bathroom are tastefully decorated with thick horizontal frosted lines.  The vanity mirror was enormous and very glamorous. I already have a hard time tearing myself away my reflection as it is and with this vanity, it was even worse ;) Separate toilet. Plenty of nice big, white, fluffy cotton towels and two comfy white cotton robes. 

Service was a little slow checking in, but the lobby is really nice. I didn't mind the wait much. There's a big gorgeous fish tank in the bar behind the check-in desk with lots of beautiful fish and coral. Reminded me of home because I'm a mermaid :)

The pool is super cool with a clear glass tunnel slide that goes right through the fish tank. The patio surrounding the pool is very nice and relaxing with plenty of comfortable seating and it's not hard to find somewhat of privacy. 

I love the location of the Golden Nugget.  I like staying downtown the best when I'm in Vegas. It's way more chill and there's a few good bars you can walk to including my fave, the Griffin. 

I have some pics of the room in a blog if you want to check them out. www.myspace.com\/bittersweet106",1,0,3

Watch out for the fine print and DO NOT check out on your TV as there are charges you may not be aware of. Make sure and check out with the front desk and REVIEW ALL charges as they add charges that are a scam or not as advertised. Also beware of the cheap upgrade offer to a higher level room when you check in. We were told for an upgrade there would be no daily hotel service fees which amount to around $21.00 a day but when we checked out they had the fees on there, hoping of course you would not notice them. WRONG, I noticed them and had them taken off. Also the top 3 floors (nothing really special) require a room card to allow the elevator to get there and it will take forever to get to your floor as all the others stop at the floors below. The steak house Vic and Anthony's is super expensive and hurried service. You will spend as much as 2 nights hotel or more just to eat here. Oh make sure and use Uber service for transportation if needed as the cabs are a total rip off, taking you the longest route always. Be smart......",0,0,0

Even with the cheap Carson Tower room we had, it was nice, clean, huge, comfy bed and pillows and an amazing view!  We ended up on the 22nd (top) floor.  Facing east but the way the hotel sits we had a great view of the Boulevard along with The D hotel and parts of the lights on Fremont street.  Woke up every morning and watched the sunrise from our room.  Staff was super friendly, no issues, room was peaceful and we heard nothing late at night from anyone.  I was starting to wonder if we had the whole floor to ourselves until I finally saw a few people the next day.  Arrived on a Friday at about 1pm.  Checked in right away.  The girl at the counter was fast and courteous.  As far as the WiFi situation goes, if you don't already make your phone a hotspot in the those types of places, you really need to get with the times!  Plus being in the Carson Tower, where we happened to be, we were in the 1\/2 mile radius that allowed us to hop on the Downtown WiFi connection.  Other than that, turn your phone into something useful (it's own hotspot) and your connection issues are solved!  We checked out on Wednesday and had a blast staying at this hotel.  Got over $100 in meal vouchers to use at the restaurants onsite along with their buffet coupons.  Hubby won $ while playing the penny slots.  And we enjoyed being amongst all the craziness of Fremont Street.  
My only one complaint, no free coffee in the rooms.  You had to pay to use the Kurig if you wanted something in your room before you headed out.  But no worries, for all you coffee snobs that have your taste buds backwards there were at least 2 Starbucks in the GN.  For the rest of you who know good coffee, there is a Dunkin Donuts inside the Fremont Hotel.",0,0,0

But the 1st room we were in in the CARSON TOWER is DEF NOT a 4star quality hotel! Its almost motel like amenities. It has an old school window a\/c unit, NO comforter on your bed, (PS- when I called  housekeeping for a blanket I was told they don't have any in the hotel?) & an old run down single sink bathroom. BUT swimming in ""THE TANK"" made the stay completely worth it! The kids had so much fun. The staff at the pool were so friendly! However, when we returned to our room we discovered the a\/c unit had leaked & flooded our room a bit. We had a few things get wet. And the TV would not turn on & when taking a shower we discovered the bath tub would not drain. We called the front desk & were kept on hold for 15 minutes. Finally we were transferred to another room, but unfortunately they did not have another comp room w\/ 2 double beds, so they gave us one king. We were moved to the RUSH TOWER which def was nicer, newer & had 4 star like amenities. But sleeping at night we noticed the room in this room had very thin walls. We could hear the people's conversation next to us. And it sounded like normal speaking voices, nit yelling or screaming or anything. Then when were were tying to go to sleep we could hear the people walking and rolling suit cases or something across the floor. Kinda hard to sleep with the noise level. The shower in this room had a very shower head, but looks are deceiving because the water came out very little, small flow & didn't feel refreshing or like you got clean enough. We were also disappointed to find there wasn't one inexpensive place to eat inside the casino. We were traveling with kids, so we didn't want to pay too much for 5 of us to eat. We did try the buffet once & would not recommend it for the price. If the price was cheaper, then it would be a better value. We also encountered a VERY RUDE employee at the buffet who said my daughter couldn't sit with us or be in there if she wasn't eating. I told her she is on special medication & could not eat for 2 hours after her pill, so she would not be eating & then she said, well then you need to buy her a beverage. Mind you, we were already seated. I explained she couldn't drink either, not even water. I guess she thought were were trying to scam the buffet & feed my daughter a free meal, which we were NOT! She kept a watch on us like a hawk. Made us feel very uncomfortable because she kept coming back by to check. Anyways- to sum. We did have a wonderful time in vegas & would stay again. We LOVED the pool & the shark tank & the slide. Def worth the other hassles.",1,0,1

My stay at the Carson Street tower was made memorable by the loooooong walk to the room. Get out of the elevator, long walk to the end of the hall, turn left, another long walk down the hall to my room. Whew. The room was OK but dated.

I stayed in the Gold Tower ""Gold Club Room"" and thoroughly enjoyed it. My most recent stay was in the new Rush Tower and loved it. They had their own check in desk with an amazing aquarium behind it,. The room was great. I'll only stay in the Rush Tower from now on.

We tend to have breakfast in the cafe downstairs and have always had a good experience there, although there is usually a wait to get in. The servers were always pleasant and best of all, the food is good.

Above the check in desk at the Rush Tower is the Chart House bar, (right below the aquarium). I had the calamari appetizer with drinks. Excellent calamari and I can only hope that Maggie the bartender is there again when I return. Perfect bartender.

Oh yeah... The pool. Amazing....

My recommendations;
1) The Pool
2) Stay in the Rush Tower
3) The Pool
3) See Maggie at the bar in the Chart House
3) The Pool
4) Try not to stay in the Carson Tower if possible",12,2,1

We were able to book two nights (Saturday and Sunday) in the South Tower for around $150 by signing up for the Email promotions on their website. 

The views from the South Tower were less than spectacular, we had a view of the Golden Nugget's parking garage. We could also see and hear the construction of a new tower that is being built. Upon check-in, I requested an upgrade to the North Tower which has views of the pool, but they only had smoking rooms available. They did give me the option to call the front desk the next day to see if anything opened up, but we decided against it since we would only be there one more day.

The Golden Nugget also has a great pool with an Aquarium in the center. If you are adventurous, there is a water slide that goes through the middle of the Aquarium which is a unique experience.

The slots at the Golden Nugget seem to be tighter than the other casinos downtown. I cannot comment on the table games.

I manged to find a coupon book, which probably could be obtained from the 24 Karat Player's Club. We dined at the breakfast buffet with a 2-for-1 coupon. Overall, the buffet was OK, they had an omelette bar which is always a plus. Another nice feature of the buffet was that they take your drink order when you pay, so you don't have to wait for the server once you are seated.

We got a room in the Rush tower, but in the 5th floor, facing a roof of a building with two large flood lights directed at our window.  Fortunately the curtains did a great job of hiding the light.

Our room was very well appointed and looked exactly like the ones on the website.  There was plenty of storage, the furniture was stylish and the bathroom large.  The bed and pillows were comfortable, and one of my daughters managed to sleep on the modular chair\/sofa not too uncomfortably.  There were some problems with the room, e.g. lack of TP, but they were quickly solved.

One minus if you have kids is that they don't have any children TV channels. We don't have cable at home so my kids like to stay in hotels so that they can watch them, but there were no such options here.  Also, internet is an additional $13.

All in all I liked the hotel, though it was very crowded.  We usually stay on the strip, and I liked how small this place was and how little I had to walk.

But who wants to unpack for one night, then pack, and move to another room? So we just stayed in our double room for both nights. Thirdly, although it was a nonsmoking room, there was the inevitable musty stench that is typical of older Vegas hotels. Fourthly, the elevators were terrible. Several of the elevators were inoperable, so there was always a crowd of people waiting. We overheard someone saying to stay off of this one particular elevator car. We thought nothing of it and boarded anyway. Sure enough, as soon as the door closed and started to move, it jerked to a stop, which was very disconcerting. The door did open and several people got off to take another car. We stayed on with a couple of other people and got to our floor without further drama. We did enjoy the pool area, although it was difficult to find two empty chaise lounges. The slide through the shark tank was fun.

It was so overpowering, that our friends did not want to enter. We called the front desk to let them know but they would not give us another room.

Because they are trying to keep their status as the nicest hotel and casino on Fremont, that also means their table limits are higher, almost comparable to places like MGM Grand and the Mandalay Bay, but not as high as the Wynn and Bellagio.

Decided to spend a few bucks and stay in the Rush corner suite. Room is nice,2 flatscreen TVs, nice bed , sitting area, bathroom with separate toilet area. But seriously, no fridge? Coffee not free, like in gold rooms - keurig but 4\/$10 kinda of rip off considering. Water $7 bottle of Fuji  - I guess Californians would consider it a bargain. But this is a suite, folks.

I have to say - I work in the service business. Deal with assholes left and right, and a tremendous amount of great people constantly - so I know the difference . The first 3 or 4 people in the door makes the place. I ran into more blank stares here than I am used to. I wanted a rose and bottle of champagne delivered to my room so I didn't have to ask for it in front of my fiancé at check- in. I was told it could not be done. In Vegas? Just wanted to request it before I got there - thought it  wasn't a big deal. I went to the H20 bar upstairs to avoid kids (people please take your kids to circus circus or Florida - not Vegas!) . Was told at 5 pm the bar was closed - the adult pool bar on Friday at 5pm. I thought that's when bars start  hoppin. Went to downstairs bar where glasses guy (you know who you are , douche) was the least happy guy in the place to serve me. paid $15 for a drink and a beer.  Then got a towel and hung out at The Tank. A great place for a ginger - plenty of shade. Reserved a cabana for day 2 - $175 but well worth it. Went to the Grotto for a snack. The waitress, I believe her name is Robin, was the first friendly face at the Nugget. Wow, I could have hung out longer. We had the mussels marinara, and she brought us extra sauce and bread. Kept the beers a comin'.

Day 2 was much better. Trust me people, you must rent a cabana. We had beverage and food service and TV and a fruit plate. But the speaker outside was deafening with the Vegas top 10 songs over and over and over. I finally disconnected the wire to it and the day was peaceful thereafter. Our waitress was cute and checked in plenty of times. We are definitely Cabana People now. 

All in all , we like the Nugget, but it really seems dated in a downtown of dated hotels. But the rooms in the Rush Tower are pretty sweet, no pun intended. I think I am tired of downtown. I think I prefer the drunk a**holes along the strip compared to the freaks and homeless downtown. But if you stay downtown, the Nugget is the best place to stay.",2,0,0

Pros - inexpensive, good location for what I needed it for, lot's of dining in-house (my dinner at the Chart House was great), plenty of gambling if you're into that (I'm not), staff was helpful.

Cons - smoke definitely lingers, was crowded when I was there, loud during day, pool constantly crowded, my room in the carson tower was very dated (I can't be picky since it was inexpensive).

Generally my experience was pleasant, however when it came to checking out, not so great. I checked out very early morning and they were unable to print my receipt. Okay, no problem since they said they would email when they were able to. Nothing for one day. I called and accounting was not in since it was the weekend, so I left a voice mail. Another day goes by with no response so I emailed. Again, no response. I called again, this time very annoyed since I had to reach out an additional 3 times from checking out just for my receipt, and finally the front desk was able to email it before I got off the phone (lady was extremely sweet and helpful).

Also, if you bill things to your room, please check your charges because we were double billed for two different things.

 - The pool is definitely a main attraction. With a shark tank right in the middle, you can go on the slide that takes you down a tube right through the tank. Most of the chairs were taken but we had a cabana so finding a place to chill wasn't an issue. The pool isn't very big but it's a fun place to hang out and swim next to the sharks. You can go right up to the tank and view them swimming in circles.

the room was a two bedroom, it was clean, and organized so no complaint. i did however disliked the bathtub and how easily, even without water, it felt like you take one wrong step and you'll break a leg (which happened to my boyfriends mother a few trips back in this same hotel btw.)

room service wasn't horrible. i was happy that they gave me time limits as to when my food would be arriving, but don't tell me an hour and be mad when i complain when it's been well over two. the food was worth it though. i rather purchase room service than eat from their direct cafe.

i had breakfast at the cafe, and my pancakes were hard as rock, and my sausages under cooked. BLEGH.

Not as many drunken frat boys, with backwards baseball hats yelling ""wooooo wooooo""!! Granted, it gets more and more like that, towards the evening, when the light show thing starts happening..

Also, the room, which I thought was going to be a touch bigger, is still great. The bed is comfy.. Its just a very nice and relaxing room.

     I really don't understand the bad reviews. On a recent trip to Vegas with another couple my wife and I stayed four nights in the Gold Club rooms. The entire staff from VIP check-in, housekeeping, valets, servers, and spa attendents were helpful, courteous and professional. 
   Our accomodations located in the Gold Tower were even better then we expected. The beds were so comfortable we didn't want to leave then in the mornings. The rooms were the nicest we've ever booked in Vegas. After a long day gambling and sight-seeing we'd return in the evening to find everything cleaned spotless by the friendly housekeeping staff (don't forget to tip the maids everyday, they work harder for less pay then anyone in Vegas). 
    By booking the Gold Club Rooms (with a second tv in the bath!) we received complimentary coffee, free wi-fi, fruits, snacks, bottled water, daily newspapers and VIP passes. I also took advantage of free spa facility use (another perk with the Gold Club Rooms). The Gold Nugget spa and staff were awesome offering all the services one would expect from a high end hotel.
    We dined once each at the Grotto (dinner), Carson Street Cafe (lunch), and the Buffet (breakfast), no complaints about the food other then the Pollo Estate at the Grotto (not the ""perfect grilled chicken"" it was advertised to be). Our other dining experiences were spread around Vegas over the four days we stayed. 
    We're done with the mega Strip hotels and their high prices on meals and rooms, jacked up table minimums, 6\/5 payouts on blackjack, tight slots, pretentious employees, and all around corporate greed. 
       ATTENTION PARENTS;   In the 1990's Vegas tried the ""family oriented"" vacation destination idea, revenues dropped and the family thing failed! The only hotel catering to children in Vegas is Circus Circus and it's a dump. Instead of thinking only of yourselves please take your kids on vacation to someplace like a National Park or Disneyland or Six Flags or anyplace but Vegas. In Vegas there's porn slappers on every corner, beggers, public drunkeness, gambling, smoking, and swearing. Ask yourselves, is this a place a caring parent would take their young children for vacation? No! Vegas is a ""Disneyland"" for adults not kids!",8,3,4

Our room was in the gold tower. It was spacious, nicely decorated, and clean. The bathroom had two sinks but could have been a little more cleaner.

We arrived by the bus from the airport which costs $15 ($7.50 from the airport and $7.50 to the airport when we left, great deal). When we got there we were roaming around the Starbucks area like idiots trying to find the check in desk. It turns out we came in a side entrance and had we come in the right way it would have been right as you walk in. There was a short line ( less than 5 min. wait). 

We checked in and we mentioned that it was my 21st b-day. He said that he could upgrade us to the Parlor Suite for only $20 per night more + a free rollaway bed (usually $20 per night). 

We didn't know what to expect as far as what the room would look like. We headed up to the room and we open the door. THE ROOM WAS HUGE! On the left side is a king size and a bathroom with a bathtub and on the right is a living room, wet bar, and another bathroom with a shower. 

(There is a charge for coffee, wifi, etc. But the hotel does that to keep their rates low, thus making it cheaper if you don't want wifi, coffee and a little more expensive if you do. SMART! Charge the people that use it and don't pass the cost onto everyone. If you want some coffee bring some of the Keurig coffee things and you can use them)

The only problem with the room was the AC wasn't working. We called the front desk and they told us they would send someone up. In no time we had our new AC unit functioning properly. We ate at the Grille, which heightened my excitement because it's inside the casino. (The Grille: Good food, but kind of pricey)

We then walked out onto Fremont street and checked out the casinos around us: Binion's, Fremont, Four Queens, etc. All are very close.  It was after this walking around that my mom and I decided to get our player's cards. We signed up and received $5 in free slot play apiece (You could win up to $1000, if you win on their promo slot machine at the players club desk)

We played on some penny machines to make our money last, but we ran out of that $5 pretty fast. Afterwards we when back upstairs to our room where my dad and sister were watching the olympics on TV (the big flat screen TV, pretty nice)

The one thing about downtown is you can get really good food deals if you look. The downside to the GN is they really don't have overly cheap food (good but not cheap). That being said we ate out at Tony Romas that night between 9-11pm in the Fremont. This is because they have steak and lobster for $11.99, a must in Vegas.

After that we went back to the GN and started our gambling for real. We played on the Blazing 7's slot machines. We didn't win much but the old ladies on our far left hit the jackpot 3 times within 20 minutes.

The next day we decided to check out the free craps lesson. This was very informative and it helped us understand the game, plus the craps dealers were very nice and funny. They opened up the table to play and unfortunately I left my cash upstairs, but watched the game for a while. My dad was up ~$100 in 30 minutes or so with only $5 pass bet w\/ odds. 

Later that day I decided to try blackjack. This was towards the evening and when I sat down it was a $5 game, but they changed it to $10. I only started with $100 and lost almost all of it within 10 minutes, not cool.Around 11pm my dad and I played craps and 4 hours later he was up $200 and I was up a whopping $6. 

Fast forward 2 more days and it is time to check out (11am). I had been playing craps was was up to $176. Sadly I had to cash out because we had to talk to a slot host about comps. To add to that my mom and sister were waiting for our bus. The slot host was slow and we never got our comps, but made it to the bus in time. (LESSON LEARNED: talk to the slot host the night before you leave.)

Okay, this review is too dang long. So in summary:

Customer Service: 7\/10
Food: 7\/10 (rating would be higher if it was cheaper)
Room: 10\/10
Casino: 9\/10
Pool 8\/10
Value: 10\/10

Speaking of noise...three mornings in a row we were woken up by banging noises on the upper floor. At first we thought someone had been murdered and they were getting rid of the evidence, but nope, it was just the 6AM construction crew doing the upper floor remodels getting started with their day. That's right 6AM! Lot of fun after getting back to the room at 2AM. Finally, after they started banging we were able to get back to sleep and left our room at 2PM for a late lunch and to start the day.

For beginner gamblers, I definitley think this is your place.  It is fantastic for asking questions, low minimums and helpful people.  It is ALL about gambling and a lot less about entertaining people...with the crap that infests the strip. 

The whole feel of downtown is enveloped in ""Old Vegas"" and I love it...especially at the Nugget, where I could sit in a smoke free poker room for 14 hours and never get bored or feel unwelcome at a low limit Texas Hold 'Em table.  The dealers were polite and good - I won!  And, the patrons were awesome!!

The waitresses were quick and remembered my drink (vodka tonic with lime) and always said ""thank you"" for every tip.

I learned how to play craps and roulette here as well ...and it was an amazing experience.  The hotel has recently undergone a renovation and it was immaculate.

I highly recommend if you are looking to get away from 'kid-friendly' Vegas and want to eat\/drink\/gamble for nearly a third of the price, head down to Old Vegas where you can enjoy yourself and not necessarily come away from the experience broke!

We are regulars to Las Vegas strip so I was kinda nervous to stay downtown. We found this place to be ""The Place"" to stay down on Freemont Street. This place was by far the cleanliest and most trendy on freemont. 

PROS:
We really enjoyed the freemont experience and tried some new things while staying there. Just watch your wallets and be aware of your surroundings. Gold Diggers at the nugget is neat if you sit outside. 

We thought our room was nice and clean and the pool is small but neat.

CONS: 
We had to pay for Wifi??? Wifi should be free now days!
casino is very small and the bar service is slow and at times very grumpy!

Took the kids in the arcade.  The room is very small with very few interesting games.  We were disappointed.
The hotel room was fine and housekeeping staff is great.
My complaint is with security.  My family has a family reunion in Las Vegas every year.  We had gathered in front of the area, which is called ""The Grand"" to take a group photo.  One machine operator told my son-in law to move to a benched area, which he did.  More of us gathered about 25 and then security arrived. The officer asked loudly, ""Does anyone here speak English?!""  We were shocked.  Most of us are Japanese-American and are not use to that kind of  treatment.  A larger, taller framed officer arrived and asked us to move to the other side of the gaming machines.  He also was NOT polite and asked us why were we wearing the same t-shirts.  I told him we gathered for a family reunion and most of us are staying at the hotel.  He just said keep moving.  I was very offended.  We felt like we were doing something very wrong.  Most of us were guests of the hotel and didn't appreciate this treatment!  We took our picture quickly and left the hotel.",0,0,0

When I was 8, I would abandon the boring, daft kids table to talk politics and play texas hold 'em with the adults.  When i was 12, I drafted a series of novels that were based on the life of coked out, wall street bonds trader and when I was in my teens, i dated a 30 year old.  I guess the last one is less charming than it is creepy but my point is, I'm great with the oldies but goodies.  I love talking to them, being surrounded by them and generally soaking in their lived-ed-ness. 

And this, my friends, is why I love me the Golden Nugget.  Not located on the glossy main strip, the GN is part of old vegas.  It's not shiny and new like the Bitchllagio or the Trampicanna (I know the Tropicana isn't new it just worked so well with word, Tramp!) and the likes but it has ten times the charm.  Okay, 5 times the charm...it's still Vegas after all and the words ""charm"" and ""vegas"" go together like ""kevin spacey"" and ""straight"".  The GN is where you can see Tony Bennett perform (yes, he's still alive.  and even he's surprised.  THAT SHOULD BE HIS NEW ALBUM TITLE!) and for all of you Swingers' fans, first of all, may god have mercy on your soul and second of all, this is the area where the movie was shot.  Downtown.  Not on the strip.  So every time you call something ""money"" (again, may god have mercy on your soul), you need to pour one for your homies over here on Fremont st.  Also, if you walk around this area late at night and you are a single lady, you might get raped and\/or shot.  The Fremont Street Experience keeps it real.  THAT'S vegas, baby.  

I've been to the Golden Nugget quite a few times in my day and well, I don't mean to brag but, all of the delightful older gentlemen craps' dealers know me by name.  Or um, they know me by, ""Dog Girl"" because I am very unattractive and\/or love to talk about dogs!   That's right.  I know Erich, Little John, Big John, Slow Hand John and Ed.  Plus, pit bosses Larry and Gail (she's my girl!  Holla!).  Man, I love the craps so much that if I were going to have a first born, I would name him or her, ""BIG MONEY, NO WHAMMY!"" or ""High Low Yo!""  or ""Swing batter batter, SWING!""  I like to mix my metaphors to play head games with my competitors.  And by competitors, I mean the other young tramps who set up camp at the craps' tables.  These are my older men, ladies.  The nickel sluts I mean slots are THAT WAY.  Bu-bye.

I bunked down in the Golden Nugget for a few nights to celebrate a friend's 40th. His wife reserved him a suite on the upper floors on the casino and we reserved a couple of normal rooms a few floors below. 

When I breezed into the room--the last to arrive--my friend M. and six others were seated in the 90s upscale living room, already charging through a dozen bottles of alcohol, arranged nicely on the bar. M. made me a clamato, one of the worst cocktails I've ever tasted. Clam and tomato juice don't mix with vodka or each other. An ominous start to the weekend. 

Once I switched to Jack and Coke I realized that the Nugget was a lot nicer than I'd expected. Renovation work was obvious, and although there was a decided absence of uptown chic in the furnishings, they were nice enough to make you feel you were living in some luxury. M.'s room was huge with I believe a queen-size bed and plenty of mahogany furniture. All in all, it's a good place to affect Sinatra-like sophistication as you slowly get blitzed into a more primitive state... 

Speaking of which, once you've descended the evolutionary ladder, stepping foot outside the casino provides ample opportunities for personal debauchery, from the infamous Glitter Gulch to any variety of lingerie and strip clubs further out into the gritty ambiance of Old Vegas. If you're tired of gazing at wheezing octogenarians shoveling their social security checks into slot machines, stick around for the nine o'clock ""light show"" along Freemont Street. The electronic ceiling is a big draw, and you can observe the jaw-dropping masses of humanity as they move through the street like packs of pale wildebeasts shuffling across the desolate plateau. It's astonishing neglect on a vast scale. The light show itself is an exercise in animated drivel, as a cartoon female falls through the clouds to a teenage soundtrack, entertaining none but the massively intoxicated. 

But then again, that's the appeal of downtown--it's nothing like the glamour of the strip. There's no pretension or false bravura. Old Vegas is too old to pose; it happily admits its tawdry state but continues to wear its faded sequins without giving a damn. Some of the local hotels, like the California, look like gutted gold digs from a hundred years ago, but that's the thing--you get to see what happens when glamour gets old. And the Nugget wears its age better than most.",1,2,2

It's impossible to go anywhere in the hotel without being assailed by cigarette smoke. Even the elevators. And - about those elevators!!

Others might think the shark tank in the middle of the pool is cool, but I can't help but feel sorry for the animals. They're in a tiny space, forced to swim round and round and round with half-drunk guests banging on the glass. Didn't make me proud of my species in any way shape or form.

It was my boyfriend's first time to Las Vegas so I thought, what better way of introducing you to Las Vegas than staying down in Fremont District. I mean, it was the epitome of Las Vegas with all the flashy neon lights, the history, and less ""popular"" with the young folk so more space to move around and the bus is constantly going to The Strip so I figured, why not stay down here? Well, for the price I paid at booking, I thought it was ok. But then came the resort fee debacle. We checked in, no problem there, but then the agent at the counter told us that we had to put a $50 hold for damages and a resort fee on the way out, saying the balance would be $42. Ok, no big deal, that's normal. Then, what blew my mind and my boyfriend's was they contacted us the next day in our room, stating that the card on file was declining. My boyfriend spoke to the agent, and told him that did not put a hold, but instead started (continually) charging my boyfriend's card to the point where his bank put out a fraud alert causing his account to be come frozen. The agent then told him that the resort fee was actually $92, none of which would have been an issue if they had communicated better when we checked in. What I don't understand is why isn't that just part of my fee when booking???? I get holding a card for damages, and that would be reimbursed if nothing was damaged (which I never deal with because I'm the kind of person who likes to leave things better than I found it). But, having someone who clearly doesn't know what they are doing, charging my boyfriend's card without his knowledge the day AFTER checking in. When my boyfriend went down to clear up the multiple charges, the male agent was flabbergasted at the lack of communication and improper procedures, that had to get the manager involved. It would have been nice if they had gone an extra mile to make it up to us, because charging a card without notifying or getting consent from the consumer is totally NOT ok. That totally put a damper on our impression of the Golden Nugget. 

The resort fee was a complete joke by the way... The pool was pretty pathetic, a circular pool with an aquarium in the middle. The water slide was alright, but riddled with kids. I guess that's what you get for staying at a kid friendly place. I don't know if there are non-kid friendly hotels in Vegas, if so, let me know.  All the sun chairs squished together so no way of really spreading out. Apparently, the doors open at 8am so you can grab a seat so you and your ""squad"" can chill together. We ended up going two hours before closing, as we are not fond of being elbow to elbow with strangers. 

Don't get me started on the Internet. 2MB???????? WTF???? If you're going to charge your hotel guests a resort fee PER DAY on top of the booking the room, you should go up on the internet speed because that is a total JOKE! OH, and some people don't gamble, some people just want to chill in their room so maybe add a few more entertaining channels as well. One more thing, it would be nice if you could also let guests access all the football games on hotel TV's because your sports book room was completely over crowded, on top of every public area with a tv that a fire marshal would have a heart attack seeing... 

The only pluses are that the bed and pillows were comfy, and besides having a wonderful view of the wall, and the D hotel, I did manage to see a bit of the Sierras which was beautiful at sunrise and sunset. 

Overall, I will not be staying here ever again. Overpriced for so so rooms, packed and sardine like pool area and a ridiculous resort fee. Unless they change their horrible communication and the quality of everything included in the resort fee. Please train your agents to communicate well, not just some, and if you're going to charge our card, please actually tell that to our face rather than behind our backs then calling us in our room to tell us the card on file is declining.",5,0,0

I would recommend this hotel to familys. Kids loved the water slide. (TIP)Go early to the pool to reserve your chairs to get a good spot.,4,0,0

Arrived Tuesday around 4pm and the check in counter at the Carson Tower was closed so we had to check in at the Rush Tower which is about a 2 minute walk.  Apparently, this is pretty common so don't be surprised.
The check in areas featured self check in Kiosks, but I did not use them.  Check in took about 3 minutes after a 10 minute wait.

Our room in the Carson Tower was clean, fresh smelling and definitely no-frills.  There was no microwave, refrigerator or Wi-fi available in our Carson Tower room.  The room includes a wired Ethernet port that requires payment as well as a coffee maker that also requires payment if you use the provided coffee pods.  The room size is standard and everything worked fine (air conditioner, shower, sink, TV, etc.).

The donut shaped pool is very nice with a shark tank in the middle and waterfalls spaced out around the pool that you can swim under or walk through.  However, the pool is small for the occupancy of the hotel so it will get crowded during holidays.

There is a small Arcade room near the Carson Tower elevators that feature an Air Hockey table and some video games.  The Air Hockey cost $1 per game.

Overall, a nice hotel that was reasonably priced ($60\/night for weekdays in mid April).  Most hotels on the strip costed about 2.5 to 3 times that amount.  The Golden Nugget is a hybrid between a cheap downtown hotel and fancy strip hotel.  We will likely come back.",2,0,0

We have stayed at several properties on the Strip, but once we discovered downtown, we never looked back. The Nugget is by far the nicest hotel downtown with very reasonable priced, compared to the Strip. We have always stayed in the cheapest tower, Carson. The rooms are clean, spacious but not super fancy. The bathroom is a decent size and the beds are comfy. We don't spend much time in our room, so a lux room isn't that important to us. The hotel and casino was renovated a while back and is still in very good shape, with new features added once in a while. The pool is the best downtown. The lower level pool has an incredible shark tank but overall on the small side. On the weekends, you will need to get down and reserve a spot with more than just a towel by 8 or 9 am. The adult pool is very small and pricey, but a nice getaway from the kids. The downside to the Nugget is that the pool attracts families. I personally do not feel downtown Vegas is child appropriate, and do not enjoy having them present at the pool (I go to Vegas to get away from my own kids lol). I would say that is the biggest con of this hotel, so if you want a more adult like atmosphere you will spend $25 to escape. We like the new Cadillac Mexican restaurant located near the pool. It's relatively inexpensive and quick. As for gambling, we never gamble here. It's expensive, the dealers aren't very friendly and we never win. We gamble at the Golden Gate, where they have $5 tables and most of the evening dealers are fun, friendly and helpful. I could say a lot more about downtown in general, but I'll stick to the Nugget this time.",0,0,0

The décor had to have been newly remodeled as everything seemed very updated and fresh. I really appreciated having ample space in the bathroom to get ready for a night out. No bump ins at all! 

The reasons why I did not give the Golden Nugget 5 stars are due to the shower issues that I encountered... seems like a showerhead went unfixed, BUT they sent someone up quickly to fix it. The other reason was the check in line. I experienced a much longer wait checking into the Golden Nugget than I have anywhere else (at much larger properties, even). I'm unsure why the Rush Tower check in was closed... but they should consider keeping it open. ESPECIALLY on busy holiday weekends.

The property outside of the rooms is nice as well. Everything appears to be much more updated than you would expect an off Fremont hotel to have.

I was placed at the Golden Nugget for a business trip to World Market Center. I was disappointed my client chose this hotel, since my sister was tagging along for the stay. The Nugget, as we named it, does not offer the glam of the Vegas strip, but rather the retro feel of old Vegas. However, maybe from the excessive gold detailing or maybe from the amazing people watching, the Golden Nugget worked its way into both of our hearts. 

The hotel room was decently clean (the kind of clean where you just choose not to look too closely at the bathroom tiles or peak behind the furniture) and the beds were decently comfortable. The decor was very dated, but somehow charming. 

There weren't many great dining options at the hotel or nearby, which was probably one of the biggest downfalls of staying in old Vegas. While there are options, they just aren't welcoming. As for entertainment, we didn't see any nearby shows, but there is no need to pay for entertainment on Fremont. The ""street people"" are plentiful, drunk, and usually dancing. Oh, and if you want to meet Elvis, this is the place! We spent most of our nights taxiing to the strip. Transportation was not cheap (about $25 one-way) but we ran out of Fremont-fun.

We've always had good luck with the dealers. Doesn't mean we always win, but the losses aren't so bad if you have a fun and social dealer. Real drinks here, not the water downed drinks you get across the street. This is my favorite place to stay in Vegas, but I'm tired of the strip.


The downsides, no kids menu at the cafe ( I know its Vegas, but come on) and the food there is far below average, rude staff and high prices for junky cafe food. Pretty good buffet upstairs and well worth a couple bucks more. WiFi was over $10 per night which is a rip off, but there is no resort fee which I love.

I stayed and got a KILLER deal..$39.00 a night with one night free.
I was here for my birthday and have to say I really have NO complaints.

The room was pretty standard, in the South Tower (I think) with a very nice strip view.  I was in a smoking room..for reasons that I hate to say are true..I can't HELP smoking in Vegas, and perhaps my roommate may have smoked in there as well..(I am a reformed smoker) anyway, the rooms were not that smelly and didn't reek like other smoking rooms I have encountered in Downtown.

Next time, I would stay in the other tower if possible as it is a bit of a walk to the elevators.

The room is standard and has a nice big flat screen that my friend had turned to CNBC for our entire stay..and that is a story for another time.

I would have liked to eaten at the buffet but it was closed for renovations..I did eat at the 24 hour place and it was reasonable and good edible food.

The pool is AMAZING and I dreamed of swimming in it the entire time but the 52 degree weather stopped me, although I did dip my foot in and I must say it was very warm.

I have stayed downtown MANY times and I must say that the Nugget is the best place there..however the appeal of this part of Vegas for me is what I call the ""Old Slutty"" casinos located here..nothing beats Binions and the Lady Luck..I won at every casino I played at so all and all it was a good trip and the Nugget just made it better.

Here is a tip, join the '24 Karat"" players club..I know it is worth it as they will keep you apprised of great deals here.

The acquarium pool was barely open.  I was there for a week and never got to use it.  The staff was rude and short tempered, I lost $2000 worth of items in the robbery (laptop, ipod, etc...), and several of my friends lost more.  According to them, they have no security cameras in the hotel, and couldn't even help us find out when we were robbed.

The policy and services at the golden nugget are garbage, they are a horrible business, and I would personally turn anyone and everyone I could ever get to listen to me away from going there.

On the plus, their black jack tables were very nice, and the casino staff was friendly.  The drinks were watered down, but I wouldn't ever complain about drinks at the cost of tips.

I couldn't sleep because music was blasting way past 1:00 in the morning. I complained and received a complimentary room for one night. I used the comp when I visited last week.

Second, I had some guest\/friends of mines too come see my room and have a couple drinks before a show that day. Then all of a sudden I get a knock from security. Saying that I had to many people staying in there and I need to tell them to get a room. I told them they have rooms here and are just here having a quick drink. They did not care and kicked them out as well as threatening and warning me, strike two. All and all this was not worth paying all that money for getting sub-par treatment.

As you walk the main corridor to the elevators serving the towers, the brass railings and gaudy gold lighting takes you back a bit to when Vegas was Vegas!

The buffet here is small by Vegas standards, but a bit classier than the other smorgasbords you'll find! The casino floor is certainly smaller than those on the strip, but I find that attractive for what little gambling I'll do. I do find most of their dining options besides the buffet to be a bit pricey, but you have a ton of other dining options on Fremont from which to choose.

The Gold Tower rooms are reasonably priced and luxurious (comparatively speaking).

I should remove a star for the crappy ""band"" they now have at the Rush Lounge.  The entertainment was 100Xs better before.

However when work calls, it's a nice way to experience living in a hotel & see what it has to offer. The Golden Nugget is located in the heart of Fremont St. in 'Old Vegas' as some call it. This place is great because it's near everything you need and want especially when it comes to weekend festivities.
The hotel casino area is ok. It feels crowded at times simply because the table areas are close to one another. Their slot machines are a mixture of new & old. However you won't find or hear the coins falling from the machines. I did notice that table games, namely craps, increase their table minimum, not by the time of day, but by the amount of players joining the game. They do offer the 'make em all' bet on craps which some casinos have done away with. 
The hotel does offer a gym that is included in the resort fee, which is something I believe all casinos are now doing. The gym is located on the Spa level in the Spa tower. The gym is located in the spa separated by cardio equipment & a weight room. The gym has free weights up to 60lbs, medicine balls, a smith machine, 2 benches & a dozen machines. It's pretty cramped in there w\/ just about 4-5 people in there. No air circulating so you're gonna work up a sweat.
The hotel has plenty of restaurants to choose from along w\/ a couple Starbucks. It also has a club to enjoy music.
The rooms are broken up into 3 towers. I was placed in the Carson tower. The room I would compare to a Motel 6 type of look & feel. Everything is outdated. Depending where your room is facing it's going to be hot in there even when the air conditioning is at 60. The bed though is comfy. No refrigerator, but if you want one it's $30 a night! They do offer the traditional shampoo, conditioner & lotion. Also apart of your resort fee you get 2 bottles of water a day, free internet for 2 users, gym access & a couple other perks.

We stayed in an upgraded room in the Gold Tower, and it was plenty big for two people. The amenities are decent, and I loved the huge, soft bed.

The pool area is a big draw, and it's pretty chaotic. Luckily, there's another pool on the second level that is smaller and a little more serene. You do have to pay an entry fee, but you get assigned your own giant chaise lounge. Plus, no kids running and screaming around the pool!

Cons:  The shower curtain seems a bit short and some water got on to the bathroom floor but nothing that an extra towel thrown on the floor couldn't fix.

Tips:
1.  See the worlds largest gold nugget ""The hand of faith""on display next to Vic and Anthony's Steak house.  61 pound gold nugget found 6 inches under the surface!!  Lets see... 61 pounds, $1100 per oz, 16 oz in a pound...... Man, I'm going to start kicking rocks around!

We chose the Golden Nugget because the reviews were fairly good and the price was great.  The hotel has a great location in Downtown Las Vegas (about 5 miles from the glitzy part of the strip) and attaches to Freemont Street so the nightlife and people watching were awesome which is the one and only redeeming quality.
The hotel charges you a $28\/day resort fee which the front desk person told us covered parking, wifi, and two bottled waters every day in our room.  As we were walking to the elevators to our room after checking in, a large patron of he hotel passed us on the left, projectile vomiting down the main hall.  It was at that point, we decided to skip the buffets.  However, we understand that a crazy patron is beyond the control of the hotel.  We arrived in our room on a nonsmoking floor to find that the floor reeked of cigarettes.  The room appeared clean but there was a musty, smoked out smell.  Some of the outlets in our room didn't work but we decided we could make due with minor inconvenience with the ones that did.  The air conditioners in the room worked, but in order to reach the desired temperature, 70 degrees, it ran all the time.  This would not have been an issue if the unit didn't sound like a foghorn.  I wasn't going to say that the beds were uncomfortable, because I thought that it may be subjective, but when the couple that we were traveling with also complained that they felt that someone was sneaking into their room and kicking the crap out of them while they slept, I feel that it is fair to say that the beds aren't comfortable.  The television reception was sketchy at best so lucky for us, we spend $28\/day for painfully slow wifi.  We visited the casino but due to the poor ventilation and massive amount of second hand smoke, we weren't able to stay long before our eyes started to burn and our throats started to hurt.  I can say with a certainty that if you fall asleep in the uncomfortable beds, listening to the deafening foghorn air conditioning, it is either from exhaustion or lack of oxygen after being in the casino.
The final straw came on the second day, when after a long day of sightseeing, we arrived at the hotel only to find that there were no longer any parking spaces at the casino due to the casino giving people who weren't staying at the hotel.  We complained to the front desk but apparently, the company's motto is ""At the Golden Nugget, we don't give a crap.""  Upon hearing that we couldn't find parking space without a 5 mile walk through the scorching desert, he explained that the $28\/day resort fee didn't actually ensure that we would be able to park at the hotel, but if we were unhappy with that, we could pay to park at another hotel and he would refund that money.  When I explained to him that a long trek through the desert to get back to our hotel was not an acceptable compromise, and that I wanted a refund of that day's resort fee, he refused and when I asked for his boss, he informed me that he had no boss (apparently he owns the hotel).  At that point, we decided that every dollar that we brought to lose in Vegas would be spend elsewhere whether that was for food or gambling.  In the end, it cost the casino far more than the refund that I was asking for.
There are far better ways to spend $300 in Vegas.  I wouldn't stay in this hotel again unless someone was holding my children hostage and they would only release them if I stayed at the Golden Nugget.",5,8,0

I stayed on Friday and Saturday nights for about $59 per night (for a 4-star hotel). The price for hotels (like Treasure Island, MGM, New York New York, etc) on the strip were going for around $150-200 per night. Anyways, I heard about the great pool at the Golden Nugget and decided to give it a try.

The hotel seemed to be completely renovated. The room was completely renovated and better than I would have expected at any hotel in the old downtown. The room was probably as good as the standard rooms in Treasure Island, MGM, and New York New York (The last times I stayed at TI or MGM were about 3-5 years ago). 

The Golden Nugget swimming pool was awesome! It was featured on the Travel Channel show, ""Extreme Pools"" around the world! The aquarium was right in the middle of the pool and was filled with about 12 sharks and a bunch of different kinds fish. It was really cool being able to watch sharks swim right by my face! Within a couple of inches! The slide was pretty cool too! It twists and turns a few times before you shoot through the middle of the shark tank\/aquarium! I had to ride it a few times. The pool was not crowded when I went.

The Golden Nugget buffet was very good for the price. It was only $21 and they had pretty much everything. It was not as big as the Wynn or Bellagio buffets, but it is much less expensive. I had crab, fish, chicken, turkey, Chinese food, Indian food, pizza, desserts, and much more.

The Golden Nugget had a $39\/night special on hotel rooms.  We decided to upgrade to the brand new (opened November 2009) Rush Tower for a total of $69 on a Tuesday.  The room was pretty and clean; King Size bed, L-shaped sectional with ottoman, nice tv, raining shower head.

Our day started at the 3-story pool.  OK. So it's not really three stories.  The 2nd story is lounge chairs you can rent for $20 and awesome cabanas for who knows how much. The 3rd floor has an adult (16 and up ... haha) pool with a bar and lounge chairs. Our 2-year old liked the very shallow area with the lounge chairs...unfortunately she thought they were slides and kept trying to climb them.  The pool is small, but there's an awesome shark tank feature dead center and  slide that slides through the shark tank.  I didn't get to ride it because I don't think they would have let my little girl on and the line was pretty long.  

There's a snack bar and cocktail service but I don't think I would recommend it because it took FOR-EV-ER for us to get our food (2 chicken Caesar salads [soggy and they skimp on the chicken...maybe found the equivalent of 1\/2 of one breast and at least 40 croutons], a hot dog and chicken fingers).  We retired to our cute room shortly thereafter.

Our one-day staycation included dinner at Chart House in the Rush Tower and the Fremont Street Experience (both of which I will review separately)

For convenience I would recommend the Gold Tower. Not too far from Fremont Street and just a few steps from the Casino floor. Stayed in a room on the 11th floor facing the pool with 2 double-size beds. Wished the beds were Queen size but worked out great. Didn't have any issues with noise.

Ended up having a Casino Host for my stay. VIP Check-in and the VIP Line Pass were terrific! The Casino Host was able to comp several entertainment and general costs. Made me feel really welcome.

I had dinner at the Chart House and lunch at the Claim Jumper. See my comments on these 2 restaurants in my other reviews.

The room was very nice and modern in style. The bathroom was small, but during the refurbish I am sure they didn't have the option to expand it. So it is probably the same size when the Hotel was built but now looks really great.

The casino in the Golden Nugget is the best casino in Downtown Las Vegas \/ Fremont Street. Great slot games, casino is clean and well kept, and a fun atmosphere.

I stayed in the Tower Suite--a 1500 sq foot colossus of a hotel room--for $301.  Unfortunately for me I was in that room a total of 6.5 hours, but the fault for that is all my own.

They gave me a matchplay coupon and $60 for $50 in the poker room, plus two free drink coupons, all of which I used gladly.  I'm really impressed with the downtown area for cleaning up its act.  My first impression years ago was that it was really run-down and past its time, but now it is clean and semi-refined, and better than a handful of on-strip locations.

I still think it's essential though, if you stay downtown, to have a car.  Sometimes you just gotta get outta there.",2,0,0

The fixtures I am sure have changed a bit, but they still feel a bit old school, and the rooms have that old Vegas feel as well. The suites are awesome. Actually, I have never seen the regular rooms, so maybe the entire hotel is suites. I like the poker crowd here as well...they all seem to be better players than on the strip. I've seen a few pros at the big table, and a few big shot athletes too! Unfortunately, they were playing at the big boys table and I was at the kiddie's. The location is great for downtown bars, and I suggest getting a room on First Friday's. You can party all night then crash at a hotel room as opposed to crashing on the freeway at four am.

On check in - which was a tremendously (unnecessarily) long process on a Wednesday at noon - we asked the representative about who we should talk to regarding which restaurants in the hotel accommodated food allergies. Her answer: no such person existed and we'd have to ask each restaurant individually. This kind of set the tone for our hotel experience; it's really all up to you and they're not going to help. 

On our first night there, in the middle of the night, our floor (and a handful of others) were evacuated due to a fire. There was no one helping the evacuees, no one providing information, no one directing us where to sit. In fact, no one seemed to know anything at all. It took hours before we were relocated to another room, and even then it was only due to our persistence. 

There are no accessible outlets near the beds in order to plug phones in, even in the newly remodeled tower. Do they understand how people live? Do they care? Due to our phones being on the other side of the room, we missed our alarm on the final day, and requested a slightly later check out. We were told no. Never had that happen before. Thanks. 

In addition, the much-lauded pool was closed anytime we could've used it, as it's apparently really poorly architected and acts as a funnel for wind, even though it's completely enclosed on all sides. Nice. I appreciate that my ""resort fee"" (scam) goes to such good use as paying lifeguards to keep things from blowing away.

Internet is NOT included and they would have actually charged us $13 A PIECE for 24 hours for EACH of our laptops, it is not a room rate; we are cheap enuf to just fire up one. What a racket. On the other hand NO $25 resort fee PLUS TAX like at the Mandalay Bay, only a $5 resort fee. We figure we saved at least $100 a night over the Mandalay Bay pricey weekend rate.

The Room was very nice, housekeeping was less obtrusive than the Mandalay Bay who think they run that property. Much smaller than the Mandalay Bay complex but everything is there. We never smelled a hint of smoke in the Rush Tower and your walk anywhere, including outside to get to the front desk or a Walgreens, is MUCH shorter than the Mandalay Bay. Can't comment on the casino, we put our usual $2 into a slot machine and quit ahead. Food was ok, the coffee shop which we have enjoyed on previous trips, was closed so had to eat breakfast in the Grotto which was not a plus. GET their coupon book at checkin for 2 for one deals on meals, drinks, etc.
Fremont Street is fun but will get old fast, there are some interesting sights around the downtown and diverse less pricey food than The Strip, like the Kabob Corner (not on a corner).
