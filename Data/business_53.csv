See through jacuzzis. Go go boxes on the pool surface, drunk madness, beach balls - get there early or expect a wait. If you got there too early they have iced coffee from a can which was good. If you don't get there early, get a cabana. Pre-book your VIP chairs because day-of was more expensive. The hostesses are pretty and hot but not that friendly.
NIGHT:
Tuck your Dr. Scholl's in your purses ladies, those stairs are no joke, even sober. And there are more stairs to get to the pool level. The rooms are fun and awesome. The bar in the boombox hiphop room seemed the least crowded. And there are some benches and tables in the middle of nowehere if you need a seat to rest. We got to hear ATB!!!

First, super cocky guys at the door..we had our names on the list but it was very difficult to find someone to ask about it because they pretty much ignore you. After almost 20min a more a more friendly man cared to ask if someone helped us yet and he had us come in. The club was so packed you couldn't even walk, literally. My feeling was that there was more people than they were suppose to have there. We couldn't really walk, we kept on being squeezed in the crowd..it was awful! I'm used to go to busy places but this one was more crowded than acceptable. 
We lasted 10 minutes and decided to go somewhere else. 
I'm giving this place one star because we could barely see the place; the people at the door is extremely arrogant and they had way more people than they should in there. At least elevator guys and securities were courteous. Marquee, never again!",3,0,0

You have to sneak past the incredibly rude bouncers in order to dance. Worse, a ring of bouncers armed with flashlights shoves an ever-moving herd of hapless club-goers ordering them to keep moving. ""Where would you like us to go?"" I asked two separate bouncers, who said they didn't know. That's because there's nowhere to go. They just keep the crowd moving to conceal the fact that there's nothing there and no room for it. Too many people is not unusual for a Vegas club, nor is a long line to get in, but for their bizarre approach to crowd control, I give this one an F. Stay away. There are plenty of places to dance in Las Vegas and even more to get drunk. I will say the video screens were cool, but you're not going the DJ was typical and I feel like I've just survived a mob trampling that was completely unnecessary. Not how I wanted to spend one special night in Vegas.

Note: This review was written on Christmas Eve of last year. I don't know why it didn't post, but reading it again reminded me of how crazy awful this place was. I don't even know if it's still around, but if it is, avoid avoid avoid.",0,0,0

First of all, you MUST come clothed. Even though its a beach party, they won't let you in the line in a swimsuit or guys with a ""wife beater."" And guys, you must have on swim trunks, no basketball shorts or anything. If you have a backpack\/bag, you must purchase a locker for storage.

BUT, once we got in, it was CRAZY. Memorial Day weekend, it was PACKED. Very hard to get to the bar so I would suggest a little pre-partying or you will feel irritated right off the bat.

Also, this is NOT a spectator sport. You have to be willing to have some drinks and get weird with the hundreds of strangers because all the drunks just LOVE to interact. They will surely annoy you if you aren't one of them.

I preferred the experience at Encore Beach Club as its cleaner and attracts a less ""douchy"" crowd. Wear flip flops because there were soggy towels and abandoned drinks all over the ground. The water looks...gross.

This review doesn't sound all that great, but I'm just warning you. If you prepare for the above and can get past that, you WILL have a good time! Great people watching, the music hits HARD here with the hottest DJ's coming through and once the drinks get flowing you are sure to have some of the most unforgettable memories that you can't quite remember... : )",1,1,0

I personally don't like Tao Nightclub, the same group that manages Marquee but this place is definitely amazing and is a standard of modern nightclubs anywhere else in the world should follow. I honestly take XS with a slight edge of this venue but Marquee is awesome because it has various dance floors, especially the downstairs area that plays hip hop music. 

The facility is clean and sophisticated and it's great even when it is not pool season because they usually open up the Dayclub area to give more space to the huge crowd that packs this place on weekends. What's also cool is they have a switch\/sound board type setup outside to project live video footage of the DJ spinning on the main dance floor. 

As for the Dayclub, I did join a friend who had a cabana here last summer and this place was very clean and professional as well. Of course all the staff and almost all guests looked in great shape. 

I highly recommend hitting up this place if you want to see what one of the newest nightclubs in Vegas is like and if your music taste is both hip hop\/top 40 or electronic dance music. To compete with XS's lineup, this club's 2012 residencies include Avicii, Kaskade, Benassi, R3hab, Chuckie, LMFAO and possibly some other good ones I left out.",2,0,1

i agree the stairs and lack of diversity in the crowd are huge minuses.  stairs to get in after a certain time, stairs to go to a different room, stairs to find the bathroom, stairs to leave.  wear flats ladies!  it's just not worth looking *cute*.  sure pain is beauty- don't kill your feet here, seriously.  i'm all about a diverse crowd with a mix of all types of pretty people.  i'm no way racist (hell i'm mex\/spanish so how can i be?!) but it seemed like there were lots of asians.  where was everyone else on a Saturday night???

they truly have something special here, but the layout is crap.  small Boombox room makes for a hot mess, literally.  if you still want to check it out:

*get on a guestlist or get hooked up for a booth
*get in line early, like 9pm early, and save yourself a migraine from line confusion
*wear comfortable flats
*bring a flask, buy $4 sodas all night, and fill up (if you're on a budget)

We came by the Monday after EDC and got ourselves a daybed with a $250 spending minimum. There were only 2 of us but it could fit up to 6 and I'd super highly recommend it if you're with a group. For only a few bucks more, you get your own line to get inside, your own little area to yourselves, and a hot waitress to attend to your food and drink needs. Here's the quick lowdown:

Pros

- Not too crowded but still a decent amount of people to create a fun party atmosphere.
- Cabanas had their own mini pool\/spa! There were even cabanas with their own pool on a 2nd story overlooking everything!
- Pool not as big as Wet Republic but bigger than Tao. Perfect size for just chillin and having a good time.
- DJ was killing it with the beats

Cons

- Really small dance area (Way smaller than Hard Rock's Rehab and Wet Republic)
- Pool not as big as Wet Republic, Daylight, or Encore Beach Club.
- Drink prices were average for Vegas day club prices so be prepared to spend ($30 for specialty drink which is same size as a medium cup at Burger King).
- Not much shade if you don't have an umbrella, cabana, or no access to the bar.

Quick tips:

-Come early. You get first pick on everything and absolutely no wait to get in.
-If you're coming during the summer and looking at getting a daybed, make sure to request for a location that has an umbrella covering it. The summer heat is no joke! It reached temperatures of 115 degrees F during our stay and I kinda felt sorry for the people who had a daybed but were cooking in the sun without an umbrella.
-Find a promoter along the strip. They can get you in free with a free complimentary drink. For guys, that's around $50 total right there you save. Only downside is you have to wait in the guest list line. That's last priority and depending on the time you come, you could be waiting for upwards of an hour to get in.
-Put on sunscreen. You can get cancer in like 5 minutes in this Vegas oven sun.
-If you bring inflatable things, they have to be deflated going in.
-I wasn't allowed to bring my Kandi in but when inside, I saw others in there with it. Weird.
-Don't bring gum. It'll get thrown away.
-You can bring sunscreen.
-Don't leave your stuff unattended even with a day bed. Security is scant.",2,0,0

An elevator takes you up to the main dance room's level which is fine. But after that be prepared to trek up a ton of flights of stairs in nondescript stairwells to get to the other rooms. However, don't let this discourage you. Definitely check out the other rooms. One of my personal favorites is the library, complete with old school bookshelves, pool tables, couches and a bar.

I went on a Saturday night and cover was $45 for guys. Music is pretty much what you would expect with house in the main room and hip hop in a smaller (very crowded) room. I ended up having a lot of fun and staying until close so I would definitely recommend this venue. An added bonus for girls is the free flip flops the bouncers hand out as you leave the club.

Not bad for club, really big and spacious inside. I was Surprised when DJ EDX cam on stage and then to top the night DJ Sander Van Dorn came out, place went wild haha.
Only waited in line for about 20min. 
While waiting in the elevator to go up to the 17th floor, the elevator host Wesley was hilarious. That's the personality all host and bouncers should. Told us about the club it self and then began dancing. Got everyone in the dancing mood and had everyone dancing off the elevator.

The only reason I rated this 3 stars was because the price. $50MEN and $20 Woman. It is very expensive inside, but its worth it.Also the downstairs dance floor hip hop was way to crowded people were pushing and shoving each other. NO room to dance.

For guys that sign up for the guest list, you still need a even girl\/guy ratio. I tripped out on this at first, but now I think it's a good idea, which is what makes the club great.

How I got around this was that my friend and I just walked around and asked girls if they wanted to bypass the lines and go in with us (bouncer told us he would get us right in if we just brought up some girls). You'll be amazed at how nice some girls are guys, so just go up and ask them. And remember the guest list. And smile. And chewing gum for your stank breath :)",3,2,1

The layout of this place is similar to XS but... I didn't really like how clouded with cigarette smoke the venue was. It made it less enjoyable.. 

Anyway, the bartenders are on it and super nice. The music is super techno\/house\/EDM which is fine but we didn't recognize any of the songs. I know that the main DJ comes on at 1am but we just couldn't get that into the music beforehand. The beats were okay, just nothing too familiar. 

That's okay though because if you go downstairs to the smaller room, they play hip hop and there's a bar, dance floor and balcony. It was a way more enjoyable atmosphere and there was much more room to dance. I loved the vibe a lot more plus the balcony view was awesome.",3,0,1

It's not my favorite club in the world but I don't love it either. It's just the place my friends and I always end up going because everyone and their Mama happens to come here. 

They've got 3 stories: top floor with the pool where they play their house and trance but also happens to have the largest space. They've got a hip hop room that is just sooo tiny it sucks because I'd be in here the whole time if it wasn't so claustrophobic. They need to switch the hip hip to the pool floor. 

I usually buy the general admission (usually $20 for girls, $50 for guys) to ditch the line. I'm not exactly one of those girls that want to wait in line all night nor want to take the chance of going with my hot girlfriends to the front and ""expecting"" the bouncers to let us in.

Great tunes before Red Foo came out, top 40 and hip hop mashups, unlike last time I was here when it was strictly house music.

We were not hardcore enough to stick it out on the dancefloor to wait for Red Foo, so we lost our spot and couldn't get back on the dancefloor when he eventually came out. Security were desperately trying to keep the crowds moving out of the too-narrow walkway surrounding the dancefloor.

I like that they keep the patio open even when it's too cold to be outside. There's enough heat lamps to keep you warm though.

Came on a friday night to see Dirty South DJ that night, line was fat longggg, so i suggest coppin that presale ticket off their website a few days before, especially if it's other major DJ's like Avicii, Kaskade, etc. 

Their club here is huge! multiple levels, outdoor patio areas with private cabanna bottle service and over flowing jacuzzi's. They did an awesome job with Marquee. Also two outside bars and a couple inside bars to get all your drunken needs. Prices for drinks aren't bad at all, I'd expect them to be more but suprisingly fairly priced

Bartenders are nice and chill, they're quick, and never takes too long. Downside: it gets crowded QUICK. imagine coming here when Kaskade is DJing!

Everyone was packed like sardines inside.The club has absolutely no where to sit. I mean come on, I know youre there to dance and have fun, but girls wear heels and we need to sit down sometime!

Let's start with the dance floor. One floor was old school rap\/hip hop, another floor was packed with house music connecting with the pool deck, and the last floor (the library) is a great place to grab a drink, chill and play pool. But then what is up with the extremely small dance floor? The security kept telling us to leave the rooftop dance floor because there were too many people. Honestly if they want people to have a fun time, they should put a limit to the number of people that can come in instead of over packing the place.

And the BIGGEST negative about this place is the stairs!  Are they freaking kidding me?! People have to travel up and down on these ghetto stairs to even get INTO the club! They need to seriously get some escalators or elevators.  It's just really tacky.

First, we all got in for FREE. Both the fellas and the ladies. This could be because it was a Monday, but as we bypassed the cashier at the front door and led into the club, it was a real good feeling. (Get at me if you wanna know the name of my hookup)

Second, the Boom Box Room was playing all the Hip Hop\/Top 40 hits. I am not a big fan of House so this room was perfect. I can't remember the last time I was dancing to 'Pony' by Ginuwine. I think at a high school dance. It is a tiny dancefloor, but  I was surprised how small the main room was when I saw it for the first time.

Thirdly, FREE SEATING. Located right outside the Boom Box Room, there's about 6 or 7 couches for anybody to sit and chill. It's also the best spot to people watch. I also noticed there was benches up by the pool area. This is great for everybody to rest up and continue the party.

Fourthly, PARTY ROCK MONDAY. After chilling on the couches, we made our way to the main room to see Redfoo of LMFAO begin his set. This place was mad packed so we found a spot in the back room. We couldn't see anybody on stage, but we had a decent view of the big screen. Once 'Party Rock Anthem' started playing and the confetti was in the air and the lights and sounds were engulfing your senses, you couldn't help but get get into it. And this is from the guy that said he didn't like House music a few sentences ago. Definitely worth it.

While I agree the multiple levels of the club and the stairs can't compare to the luxurious layout of XS, the music and the vibe definitely win over Mr. Wynn's place. 

This is definitely the hottest club in Vegas right. At 2am. there were still people trying to get into the place. Make it a point to get here.",6,1,4

But they kindly took care of her and even offered to get us a cab... 

Thanks GUYS! :)

I've partied at Marquee many times and have gotten bottle service with my friends 4 times. It's so much better when you have table reservations. You get in a lot quicker. Even if you're all guys. Haha. It's Vegas so expect to SPEND. We have gotten a cabana at night during the summer and that was really where it's at. We had a big group of guys and girls so the cabana was the right call. It was our first time at Marquee and Kaskade was DJ'ing that night so the club was packed not too long after doors opened. You have 2 bottle service cocktail waitresses pouring your drinks. You have 2 tv screens that show you what's going on in the main room. You have storage areas for the ladies' purses\/slippers. And mainly, you have a place to chill and sit. Yes, youre gonna need at a megaclub that goes on all night into the morning hours. You will spend money but it will be worth it.

We've gotten table reservations around the pool area as well. Smaller than the cabana but more central to the party. We had a small group of friends in town that weekend so it was perfect. 

There are 3 main areas inside the club. You have the main room where the headliner DJ obviously plays. You have the Boom Box which is the hip hop room. You walk down the stairs and follow the signs. It's always TOO PACKED in there. It's claustrophobia inducing and I'm not even claustrophobic. Go see for yourself. You've been warned.... The last area is The Library which is upstairs and more on the loungey down-tempo tip. There is even a pool table in this part of the club.

Marquee has it all. Attitude at the door, big name DJs in the main room, hip hop and trap in the Boom Box and chiller sounds in the Library.. I'll stick to bottle service outside by the pools. DK Skratchy, DJ Vice and Eric D-Lux are our favorites to come see at Marquee.

Marquee Day Club is another story. Good times under the sun. There are card tables during the day and night near the bar outside closest to the main room.

Not in love with the layout, but do like the different areas. Of course the top floor library was my favorite with its own DJ, Pool Table, semi free areas to sit, and outside access to see the dance floor on the main floor.

Dance floors are small and are more like should to shoulder standing areas.

After a long hot day of walking the strip, we stumbled upon a promoter who had a guest list for free entry and also a two hour unlimited drinks at Marquee. So, since it was free, me and three of my friends decided to go there. And boy, am I happy I did. When we first got in, we were escorted out of the regular line and told to wait in the guest list line. The guest list line was so much faster! Once we made our way in, we went straight to the bar where we each were able to get two drinks at a time. That was another plus. After having about 4 drinks each, we went in the back and enjoyed the outside\/pool view. We were able to sit  at a cabana even though we did not have bottle service. 

When we decided to go in, the dance floor was jumping. The DJ was playing the usual Vegas music, I guess it's EDM mixed with some hip hop. Althoug EDM isn't my preferred choice, I made the best out of it. I jumped up and done and left with a lot of silver, sparkly paper on me.

At the time of my visit, the hip hop was not open. Someone had rented it out. If it wasn't for that, I would have definetly gave Marquee the total 5 stars. But I was bummed. I wanted to hear some 2 Chainz!!",2,0,0

A friend paid the bouncer (how much I don't know) to get us to the front of the line. Girls were $20 and guys were $50 cover. Um, huh? Girls gotta pay? A first for me. 

When we got in, the place was soooo packed that there was no room to move. On the dance floor where I'd like to hang and groove, I could only stand and bob my head until the elbows and pushes annoyed us that we had to ditch. 

The outside was beautiful! You can see the strip. Would be fantastic for summer. Too bad it waws 30 degrees the night we went. Everyone crammed inside. 

Very pretentious people inside. Lame. We didn't want to leave just after 30 minutes and dropping all that cash to get in but there really was nothing to stay for.

WORST club in Vegas and in Everdom! The line was ridiculous, but that was not really issue because, hey, its Vegas. However, we had to walk up about 5 flights of stairs in order to get into the actual club which is extremely inconvenient, especially if you're in heels. It was packed to the point that I was rubbing bums and back sweat and inches away from sucking face with complete strangers everywhere I turned. When my friends and I finally made it to the table area where a friend of ours had a table, that was crowded as well. So crowded that the bouncer asked us to leave the area and hang out on the dance floor, which was, again, CROWDED! Music was mediocre. Nothing to get excited about. I'm just happy we got in for free because if I had paid for even 5 minutes in that place, I would feel like a complete failure in life. On a more positive note, there are tons of other clubs in Vegas that play way better music and have a much shorter line and plenty of room to get your groove on.",1,1,0

As far as the layout, light show, dancers, performances, etc, Marquee definitely is an extremely solid 4.5.  The costumed dancers and the light show, man..what a great combo.  However in terms of managing the club itself, I had to bring it down to a 2.   To say you felt like a sardine in a can is an understatement.  You had girls crying, people throwing up because of the lack of air, literally being unable to move 10ft, etc.  Can't help but laugh about it , what a shit-show!

Holding true to someone else's review, The biggest thing I would advise to everybody is to get a table.  Especially when the venue has a big DJ or other performer, Marquee Nightclub is best enjoyed when you have a table booked and have deep pockets to unload some cash.  You will be so happy with that decision as you see other people suffering the above mentioned.  Worth the money in exchange for the feelings of euphoria you'll get when those steam cannons, lights, glitz and glam start hitting you from all directions.  

If on the other hand, you do not have deep pockets and still want to see that huge EDM dj at Marquee, get there early and stake your space on the dance floor.  But be prepared to camp there because if you leave that space to get a drink, you're not getting back.  

To be clear, I'm not upset with the experience because it did demonstrate the superiority of XS and solidifying the decision to stay at the Encore moving forward. 

My final thoughts:
GUYS - Shell out the extra $$$ and get yourself a table by the floor, you will have a great time for sure.    

Ladies - Get yourselves to a table",5,3,1

He gave us free entry passes and said to text him and then he would text us when he's ready to escort us up to the club. He texted us, we met him, and we went up to the club in an elevator. I know not of the stairs ya'll speak of, for which I am glad. 

If you like house music, they have plenty of that. I think the layout is cool, but when it gets crowded its a real pain in the ass. Security will move you if you are not moving but are in the aisle. I really didn't spend much time in the house music area though. I went to the ""boom box""\/ hip hop room.

 It was small and crowded, but the DJ was sick! Also, when a dude was getting up in my space too much security saved me and put me and my girlfriend up in VIP. Honestly if we weren't in VIP I think we would have left way sooner because the dancefloor was PACKED. But security told us to have fun and to feel free to stand on the couches and dance. We were going to anyway, but thank you. 

There is also an outside area you so you can go hang out and get some air. I liked that aspect too.

I've had a friend tell me she took her man there and had a totally different experience. and she had to pay $40 for tickets a piece and then had to go up a million stairs and security hassled them the whole time so they left early. My rating is not based on her experience at Marquee, just a little smidgen of extra info for ya.

I would say overall this club is overrated. I expected so much more because of the hype! I would go again for sure though, because of the hip hop room.",0,0,0

The dancers were great, the music was perfect, but of course very loud. The service was outstanding and we never had an empty drink. I couldn't believe how many people were still in line at 1:30am. While we had an awesome night, I don't have the patience to ever wait in that type of line.

If you have a room key, you can get in for free up to 2 people. So when you are at the front desk, ask for extras. LOL! Also, you get to skip the line if you have a room key.

Beautiful club with surly bouncers, and as the night goes on it becomes impossible to traverse the nightclub from one side to the other due to extreme crowding, all the while the bouncers are screaming at you to move...but you can't. 

The night Benny Benassi was there in February, bouncers weren't letting anyone on the dance floor, and you'd get screamed at if you tried to stand on the outskirts to watch the show. One bouncer ordered me to go downstairs to the hip hop room. Um, excuse me? We paid a lot of money to see Benny. Ok, so I didn't pay to get in, but my man did.

Outdoor space is gorgeous, although the night we were there it was like a mini hurricane outside, contributing to the extreme packing of the interior with people. Lot of places to sneak a quick break sitting down without having to pay for bottle service, that's really nice.

We got a ""hook-up"" from a promoter, but later found out the guys standing outside the club handing out the fliers were giving out the same exact deal. We ended up having to wait in line for 20-30 minutes before being let in. Than we had to be split up cuz our group was too big. We finally got in at noon and it was already packed. There was no where to sit. Even the edges of the pool and planters were occupied with people. At first I imagined having a crappy time because we had no where to post. I wasn't about to stand around all day! My guy friends realized that the only way we would have a good time was to buy a daybed. They wouldn't tell the girls how much it was but considering it was in the middle of the splash pool it had to be at least $1,000. We had a pretty nice spot next to the water fall and bar. We had a good time together dancing, drinking, and we even got to see and talk to Rihanna! She complimented my friends and I on our dancing (since we are all dancers). I think this was the highlight of my day here. At the end of the day we found out that along with the day bed we had to spend a MINIMUM of $500 on drinks!! Most of the group was already to go so the ones paying the bill had to stay behind and order a couple more drinks to reach the minimum. Don't ask me why they didn't tell us this before.

We originally had a cabana for the Insomniac party on Sunday at Marquee Dayclub. However, when we arrived, we decided that we wanted a daybed so we swapped. The staff were super accommodating and made the change promptly, placing us right in front of one of the grand cabanas with an umbrella, near the stage.

All in all, this was my favorite dayclub experience in Vegas, one that I wouldn't hesitate to pony up the cash for again. What made it so great? 

The staff. 

They were friendly, and super welcoming - from security on down to our amazing waitress, who waited on us hand and foot all afternoon long. 

The food! The food is amazing gourmet food that's a cut above what's available at other day parties around the city, and of course, you have access to the best alcohols available.

- crabcake sliders: delicious, tender

- guacamole: spicy and oh-so-delicious (really!) 

- chicken wrap: amazing

- fries: perfection (although a tiny bit overdone)

First time I attempted to get it, it was a no-go.  3 lines that was so ridiculous, it put Disneyland to shame.  Second attempt, even though we were there early, we opt for a promoter just in case even though we were early.  We didn't want to miss a chance.

This place was huge which is a major plus.  I need some room to dance people.  I loved how they had security controlling the dance floor because it seriously looked like it was packed.  I was so sad that I had to leave and wasn't able to get back in. =[  
I know they say there's 3 rooms, the main room and the hip hop room, the last room was a game room I think?  When I was trying to look for it, I went into this hall that was basically a behind the scene look at the Library.  It was pretty awesome. But when I found the room, there was pool tables and a bar and such.  I left because I wanted to dance.
The outdoor pool was beautiful.  I would love to see how it looks for the Dayclub.

The music was amazing.  Loved the house music and the hip hop music so I got the best of both world's.

Now the go-go dancers here were more entertaining than XS they were well choreographed and it was fun to watch while I'm dancing.  

Major downfall: who's the idiot that put the effing stairs there?! I was so confused and lost because it didn't tell me which floor was which.  My feet were killing me and I was out of damn breath from hiking up those things.  And to have the elevators there and not working? What a tease man.  Not cool.

So you can basically say that the main room (the Library) was a high-class rave type of club and the hip hop room was more like a regular bumpin' club.  Excellent.  Just work on those stupid stairs and I'm all game for this club.",4,1,1

I suggest getting in touch with someone who knows someone to get you a table (if you want bottle service) or at least to waive the cover if you aren't planning on a bottle. Of course, having a good ratio never hurts either.

Trying to navigate the entry line can be a bit confusing, but just keep walking toward the elevator and prepare for an experience. Upon arriving on the nightclub floor, you can feel the bass even before exiting the elevator. Follow your hostess to your table (or just make your way to the dance floor\/bar) and have at it! The tables are spread around the floor, throughout the club, and depending on which you decide on, can give you a sense of superiority over everyone else in the club. You can even have your own security guard who holds the key to your private bathroom. 

While the dance floor has multiple ramps for ingress and egress, it can get pretty packed, so get ready to push your way through if you're set on a particular area. No matter where you are, though, you can embellish in the confetti and CO2 dispensers (a nice way to cool off in the crowd). The DJ booth is at a good height, as are the platforms for background dancers who add a nice touch to the ambiance.",0,0,0

Yes, the venue is beautiful, the people are beautiful, and the main stage lighting setup is great. But what's the point of having a club when there's no room to dance? I came to see my favorite edm dj Kaskade this past Saturday, and I didn't even get to see him because security kept shuffling us around the main stage.

Lines are too long, venue was too crowded, and the outdoor area didn't play the music loudly enough. All they had outside was a video of Kaskade spinning inside. NO ONE WAS DANCING! How could you dance without any room? Ugh. I've seen Kaskade over 10 times at venues around the world and this was by far the WORST.

HOWEVER!!!!! One thing did save the night: THE HIP HOP ROOM! This room was AWESOME!!! It wasn't crowded, the music was great, everyone was actually dancing, and they even did a cool bottle service show with the servers dressed in referee outfits holding sparklers and champagne bottles.

Lastly, I like how they have improved their method of letting pre-sale ticket holders into the club. No long lines if you've purchased your tickets ahead of time, so make sure you do so (if you even decide to spend your night at this club)!",2,0,0

We tried to schmooz the bouncer just to check out the atmosphere inside Marquee, just to walk in and walk out kinda thing, but it didn't work, there was only 2 of us so it was a no go. 

After our failed attempt at trying to get in for free, we decided to sit at the bar, poolside and have a few drinks, hang out and play catch up... Before we could take a second sip of our drinks, we're approached by 2 young ladies asking us if we'd like to join them inside Marquee because they're 2 girls short of getting into for free, so we got up and walked on over the guest list line! 

We were in line for a mere 10 mins. The line was outdoors and it was pretty chilly that night but they had heaters comforting those of us shivering in the cold. Everyone in line was so nice, very chit chatty and was a real nice vibe to start off the night. 

One of my gripes with this place is the fact that being that there are 3 (or 4, can't remember? lol) floors and they made us walk the stairs, BLAH. I would've rather they make it ONE large room and party it up that way, not here-- get ready for a workout. Females in HIGH heels are really not made 3-4 floors worth of stairs. Cardio should be done in gym shoes! GAH. 

We found these kind of, hidden rooms that are overlooks for the club. There's a pool table on one of the upper levels. Bars, like in any club, take a long time to order drinks, so nothing new there. 

We breezed through the floors, since we were there just to checkout the place, we weren't really in club attire which I thought was strange that they let us in. I was in a tank top, cardigan, jeans and heels. My GF was in practically the same thing, 'cept she was wearing fancy flip flops, we were sure that we were going to get in because of that, but they let us in!

While I've been clubbing before, I wasn't really sure what to expect at a pool party. We arrived on a Thursday morning around 11am. While it wasn't necessarily packed at that time...there was still a good sized crowd. We reserved a daybed for our group which definitely came in handy. The daybeds have built in storage bins where you can throw in bags, etc. They are not covered so your only chance to escape the blazing heat is to go in the pool or wear a hat. 

It is important to note that we went on 4th of July weekend (not sure if that may have affected the usual crowd size). But I can safely say by around 2pm this place was PACKED! 

My generous friends covered the drinks\/food costs while we were there so I cannot speak to the exact pricing. Though I know all drinks are very marked up, so be prepared. I can say, however, that the drinks were strong and the nachos were very good. 

While I was initially apprehensive of the overall cleanliness of this place, I was left pleasantly surprised. The bathrooms were CLEAN (thank God)! Maybe because we were there early enough before the massive crowds kicked in...but we were able to dance\/take group pictures in the pool, relax on our daybed, and have a great time!

This past weekend was the first time I ever partied at Marquee's Dayclub and let's just say: IT WAS FUN.

I had a grand time. 

EDM music (not my total favorite), but I was caught up in my day-drunkness and celebrating my birthday to not even care! 

The lines at the bars are ridiculous. People at every corner you turn to. Half naked people! Only two bars: in the front of the patio and the back. There was a dancefloor towards the back bar, where the DJ spun, but it was so small. I feel like people just started making their own dancefloors throughout the place.

I don't think there is much a difference to the nightclub. Large crowds. Only two differences I noticed was the inside club was closed off and there is daylight out.

Overall, it was cool. Crowded like crazy. Ladies you're free. Men, depending if you're a male group with no ratios you can vary from 30-50 or more depending who is spinning that day. 

Hope that was kind of helpful!",2,2,2

by far my favorite club in las vegas! to get in, you take the escalator through the giant chandelier located in the middle of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, which just gets you excited. i've never had trouble getting in, but that's because i'm lucky enough to be able to get on the guestlist, so get in for free. our guy friends didn't have too much trouble either and got in for free once, but i think that was a fluke so don't expect that :) 

inside: its HUGE, with a stage that is usually packed (in a good way) surrounded by tables. dancers are incredible, lights are amazing, mist & confetti just top off the night. i swear, they put on a show for you, reminding you you're in vegasss!!

The world-class DJs booked here on a weekly basis are nothing short of mind-boggling, and the Funktion One sound system is an absolute monster. Add to that customized LED displays behind the DJ booth, cryo, confetti and foam and the dancefloor becomes one of the most intense spots in the world to dance your ass off.

The moment that the headlining DJ at Marquee takes the stage every night is made to feel like an even,t, and the energy on the dancefloor is nothing short of incredible. I used to complain that nobody in Vegas danced at nightclubs. Not anymore.

The rooftop pool deck is one of my favorite off-dancefloor haunts, the sound system is fairly impressive for an outdoor setup (but still conversation-friendly) and the bars outside tend to be quicker than in.

The Library is a cool space as well, a genuine library setting with an intriguing collection of books, all vaguely Vegas-related, or sin-related, or somehow relevant in a six-degrees sort of way. The cocktail servers upstairs, it should be noted, dress like sexy librarians. I'm just sayin'. If that's your thing.

The crowd is a blend of mixed motivations - househeads hypnotized by every crossfade, bottle rats who'll be carrying their shoes halfway through the night, VIPs staking out prime real estate - but one thing's for sure, this crowd comes to party.

A few of the little touches that impress me about this place are the subversive Marquis de Sade and Oscar Wilde quotes painted on the walls and mirrors, the stiff drinks (expensive, of course, but strong all the time), and a thoughtful nod to music lovers, the fact that the main room sound system is piped into the bathrooms, hallways and anterooms so it doesn't feel like you're leaving the party every time you need to use the bathroom.

The club stops being fun when it hits capacity though, when bouncers have to block off the dance floor. It's even less fun outside the club at capacity, so get here early or buy presale tickets. Especially for DJs like Benny Benassi, Kaskade and Steve Angello. But don't get shut out of the premier house music showcase in Las Vegas.",2,0,1

I AM NOT A FAN!! Hear me out before you judge me :). Haha.

Pros:
1. I'm a girl so I'm always on the guest list, therefore I never have to wait. 
2. Three dance floors
3. Kaskade performs here!

Now let me tell you why I'm giving this place only three stars.
I went on labor day weekend and the place WAS SOOOO PACKED. There was no way you can get anywhere. For Friday night, I went to see Avicci and the main dance floor was closed off because it was too crowded (this is understandable). So my friends and I went to the hiphop floor. The floor was so small and crowded. I seriously don't know how any one can dance in there because you can barely even more around. I wanted some fresh air so I went outside to the pool area. Yup, still crowded. It was nice and I like how they have tables for people to gamble outside but it was just way too crowded for me. Oh man, let me tell you about the stairs. It's ridiculously! The bathroom line was ridiculously too. Thankfully, I stayed at Cosmo so I just held it in until I got out of the club. The club was super crowded that my friends and I decided to leave early. It was probably about 1am.

I went back to Marquee for a second night to see Kaskade performed. My friends and I got there early so we can get to the front of the main dance floor, yup we wanted to see Kaskade! :D. It was 11pm and the dance floor was already closed off. I wanted to use the bathroom so bad but I knew if I was to leave, I would not be able to see Kaskade so I held it in :(. Kaskade finally came on at 1:30AM. I was in the front of the dance floor and had a lot of room to dance so that was nice. The only problem about being in a dance floor that is closed off is that you cannot leave to buy more drinks. Therefore, I highly recommend you guys to drink as much as you can before getting into the main floor or else you will be sober for the rest of the night! Once it was 3AM, I decided to leave. It was so hard to leave!! Everyone was trying to get into the main dance floor so there was such a huge crowd outside of there. I had to push so many people (I felt so bad but you got to do what you got to do to leave that place!) I felt so squished while trying to get out. 

In conclusion, I love Marquee for having Kaskade but I would never come back to this club. It's way too crowded for me.",2,0,0

The layout is awesome and the decor is very artsy. I really like being outside, checking out the view to the strip, and seeing all the lighted jacuzzi tubs. It makes me want to check out the day club! The first night we went, they weren't playing any hip hop music because that room was closed for the night. That was a little disappointing, but we still had fun outside and in the main room. The second time we went it was up and running, so we spent most of our time there. We also made a trip to the library, which was pretty nice. There's a pool table, bar, and a lot of places to sit. There are also about 5 hostesses that are dressed like extremely sexy librarians. Both times I've come here, I never had to wait in line more than ten minutes because we were on a guest list. I saw how long the line got outside though, so I was very glad I didn't have to wait in that. I even got an open bar wristband each time as well. The wristband was good for vodka drinks from 10-11pm, so I made many trips to the bar between that time and I never really had to wait behind people there either. 

The industry nights, minimal waiting with guest list, open bar, themed rooms, and good music make this place a 4 star club for me.",4,2,4

With that said, Marquee is one of the best clubs, simply because it is operated by the team who also runs Tao and Lavo (both in Las Vegas and NYC), as well as other top club\/restaurant venues.

Marquee always has top notch DJs. Location inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel is a big bonus, as is their pool and day club.  Lines will get ridiculously long, so if you're gonna try to wait in line (which I don't recommend), get there very early. 

Groups of girls really shouldn't have a problem getting in (provided they get there early), but it's always best to know someone who works there, or promotes for the club. Knowing the folks who run Tao or Lavo can also help. Groups of guys basically need to get a table -- and be prepared for hefty table minimums.  Mixed groups are better off getting a table as well.  It's worth getting there early, paying the high prices, and enjoying the ambiance and music that makes Marquee one of the top clubs in Las Vegas, if not North America.  

I noticed a previous review about workers here being ""ghetto"" and ""unprofessional"" .... I find this very hard to believe, and perhaps might be the result of Vegas nightclub chaos and attitude that permeates all venues in Vegas. I know the team who operates these venues, and they are top notch folks who really know what they're doing, and make sure they pay attention to every detail -- especially the people who work at their clubs.

While I love how open this club is, they decided to shut down the outside area as we walked in. Just imagine, a regular marquee crowd...only half the space. It was PACKED and WAY too hot. After this experience, I cant really deny the looming reality of Marquee any longer. The dance floor is just way too small. Yes it's cool dancing shoulder to shoulder sometimes, but not here. It's just not fun. They HAVE to remodel the dance floor. You cannot have major headliners perform with such a small dance floor.

Chuckie, one of my favorite club DJ's, was spinning which would lead some to assume that I would have a great night. But his set was...just awful. He wasn't even playing to the crowd. Bring me the Chuckie from 2 years ago!
The one saving grace was, believe it or not, the bartenders.  They were really friendly and very unlike a typical Vegas bartender.",0,0,0

Me and some friends went here this past weekend for my first time, because we knew some promoters and we had some free tickets so we tried our luck.  All I've been hearing lately that this is straight up the new hot spot on the vegas strip for electro and house.

When we got into the cosmopolitan and saw the place, my first reaction was HOLY SHIT this line is redonkulous.  The line went back from as far as I could see, that I wasn't even going to attempt to walk to the back of the line and wait.  

Because of some hookups we ended up entering the club from the 3rd floor, yes i guess they have multiple floors to enter.  We had to walk soooooo many stairs because I guess this was a back entrance for ticketholders or something.  I swear I was sweating before we actually got to the main area.  They do have an elevator to take you up btw its just at the main entrance.  On the way up I caught a glimpse of a smaller area that was hip hop only, where all the ""I hate all electro"" people are....wackness.

The main area is a decent size, but has a pretty small dancefloor.  The LED thing in the back of the dj is just amazing.  I mean I wasnt on anything ""special"" that night but it still kind of got me stuck on staring at it a few times.  They also had glow in the dark ballerinas above the dj.  The dance floor gets kind of crowded, but to cover for their small dancefloor, they have a HUUGGGEEE outdoor area to kick it.  I feel like you would get the most out of this place by getting a table and bottle service.

Standard vegas prices, realllllly stiff drinks so you def get your moneys worth, and decent bartender service. (fast inside slow outside)

Sick club, def going to be a place I always come back to for a while or until something better comes up.

We bought tickets for Gareth Emery online and stayed at the Cosmo (4 nights). We paid 50.00 for a guys ticket and 20.00 for mine. We are big fans of the DJ and planned our trip around this event. When we got to the club the guy said oh since you are a hotel guest, you get in free. So basically we wasted $70? Nobody told us that before. Anyways we get in and by 12 we werent allowed by security to get on the dance floor and aggressively told that we couldnt stand around but had to keep walking towards outside or another room. I told them that we are there for this dj and they didnt care. They eventually let us on the dance floor and it was dangerous...people pushing...way over the limit. We didnt stay for the entire set and we were so frustrated. There were several crowd control guys with flashlights constantly telling us to keep moving. How about telling the people to move who don't even know who the dj is? Its just not fair that fans of the dj cant even enjoy a show. We are very upset by this experience.

You go up two flights of back-alley fire hazard metal stairs and end up in a giant arena with a DJ booth in the center and dance floor directly in front. Surrounded to the side of the dance floor are tables for the high rollers and more bottle service tables. There's a path that leads you outside pool area that's about 2x the size of the inside club. There's another DJ booth outside for the day clubbing, pool party crowd; missed the chance this time around Vegas. 

Make sure to get to the venue early. I bought pre-admission tickets for Alesso so I didn't have to risk the chance of selling out. You get put in a separate line if you bought tickets in advance and that expedites the time getting into the club. I thought I got to the club early at 10:30p.m but there was already a massive line stretching around the vinyl rope. Finally got into the club around 11:00p.m and the dance floor filled up real fast. Once the dance floor was packed, there's security guards around all entrances of the dance floor limiting the people that can enter the floor. 

The LED screen above the DJ is beautiful. The music is crisp and you felt the vibes while one the dancefloor. The gogo dancers at the very top of the DJ booth are mesmerizing.  Unfortunately there are tons of people on the dancefloor so there's a good amount of pushing. Fights can break out. Coconut water and bottled water (fancy ones) are the same price, $8 per bottle. I would have been completely fine with just an ice cold deer park water. Drinks are appropriately priced for a Vegas club. 

I would definitely come back here for future events. Make sure to get there early so you don't get cut off the dance floor because that's where the fun is.",0,0,0

Both their nightclub and dayclub are great and provide a great ambiance.  The people are chill and the staff is amazing and very attentive.  For the nightclub, I always prefer a table outside by the pool, to avoid the craziness and packed inside.  The dayclub is also amazing, but I highly recommend to get a table so you have a place to hang back when needed.  Overall, I recommend Marquee to all my friends who are venturing out to Las Vegas.

We started off the night with free drinks and then took some photo-booth pictures. I was dead sober while my friends were chilling so I decided to smoke a joint. Yea, it was stupid, but also hilarious. I was promptly kicked out 10 minutes later. The big bouncer guy made sure to really X-out my stamp.

Having two separate rooms for different types of music is definitely a plus. Glad that they cater to both crowds. The only thing to complain about this club is that the dance floor is not very big.

I didn't enjoy my experience here at all, and I don't think I'm that hard to please! Maybe it's because I came on one of the most crowded nights (Saturday) and had guys in my party, so I had to expect an experience like the one I had.

 - Saturday nights always have a big name DJ playing at this club, so that means an even larger crowd than normal. Guarantee yourself entry by purchasing pre-sale tickets, or else you're going to have to stand in line for 2 hours waiting to get in. 

- If you want to go the promoter route (like I did) because you don't want to spend money on the entry fee (because HEY, you're a girl and should be able to get in for free!) hit up a promoter and ask for a hook-up. All girl groups = comped entry. If you're coming with guys, have at least a 1:1 ratio so that the girls can get in for free, and the guys will have to pay a cover. Reduced fees for guys are rare\/never happen, unless you get lucky.

-- Guestlist closes at 11, so get in line EARLY. Serious about this. Even if they cut the line off after you and say ""Guestlist line ends here,"" keep in mind that the bouncers always overestimate the number of people who can get in so that they can fill up the club. But that's never going to be a problem, because the club is always full. If you're in line by 10:30PM and the line runs to the other side of the hotel, don't even bother. You're gonna end up paying $20+ to get in (girls) and guys will pay $50, and waste 2 hours of your life waiting in line. Had I known that I was going to have to pay at the end, I would've left and gone to another club where everybody would've gotten comped admission AND drink tickets!

--  Nice design for a theatre, but a horrible place for a dance club. Bathrooms are all the way outside past the pool area, and you have to make it through the crowded main dance floor to get there. And to get to the other mini dance rooms, you have to go up 1-2 floors. No elevators to take you there, and you're walking in heels. NOT fun at all.

-- The one deciding factor on whether I like a club: the music. I am not hip enough to jump on the Electronic Dance Music bandwagon, and this place is ALL about EDM! Man I just can't dance to it. The other area Library had better music, but it was more of a lounge area with pool tables and not really a dance floor, and the Boombox was too crowded and played boring booty grinding music. I was pretty bored the whole entire night.

Overall, I'm glad I got to experience Marquee because it's supposed to be the #1 Vegas club, but unless you're willing to drop a couple thousand dollars to get a table and be treated like a queen\/king, don't bother. If you just want something simpler, there are a bunch of different clubs that you can go to with WAY less of the hassle.",3,0,0

My friends had us on the guest list already so admission was free and since we got there around 10pm ladies get unlimited drinks for an hour from 10-11pm for free with wristband ! Pretty sweet deal because we just handed off our drinks to our guy friends and kept heading back for more. EDM was the main stage inside and HipHop outside by the pool. The venue was absolutely gorgeous. Although it started filling up after 12 and my friends and I have made the mistake of exiting the main dance floor because when we tried coming back security roped it off and we could not come back in on the floor ): so best you use the bathroom get your drinks and STAY THERE because you cant get back in on the floor. And thats what sucked so much about it because Tritonal was playing that night and we wanted to see him but it sucked because it was so overpacked we didn't really know where to stand because you cant be in the walkways and and the VIP bottle service tables took up most of the space as well. Tritonal was tight to watch even though I was blocked half of the time (since im short) the lighting was great and surreal though and so with the sounds and vibes there. I think what it didn't like though was that it was so CROWDED. We even chilled outside for awhile because there was actually space to breathe and just chill. Outside scene was cool too since they played hip hop and all the old school jams. But our stay was supposed to be until Tritonal set was over but we were so over with the scene that we left around 130am because it was just to packed.

And what is up with the extremely small dance floor? The security kept telling us to leave the rooftop dance floor because there were too many people. Honestly if they want people to have a fun time, they should put a limit to the number of people that can come in instead of over packing the place.

And the BIGGEST negative about this place is the stairs! WHATTTT THEEE HECK?!!! are the freaking kidding me?! Why dont they make elevators or escalators?

I just happened to get the b---h cashier.  I didn't want to hold the line anymore so screw it we paid.  2 doormen AND the hotel told us it'd be free before 11pm. Even he was rolling his eyes at the girl on the cash register.

The wait isn't long if you grab some girls with you. Ask the doorman and he'll put you in VIP if you're staying at the hotel. You'll still need ladies though.

We go in drop our money cuz I know the hotel will fix me up with my cover charge tomorrow. Place is definitely packed. Cool place, great music. The elevator going up is kind of stupid. Like sardines being sent upstairs every 2 minutes.  Leaving, now that just clinched this place is utter crap. Who the hell walks 4 flights of stairs to leave a high end club?

Those stairs are a lawsuit waiting to happen. Plus the garbage can I get to walk by at the backdoor is awesome. Thanks for reminding you're garbage.

Everyone knows the place is fun when you're drinking and partying it up. But I wanted my cover back so I went to the hotel on checkout day. The hotel ended up comping me what they could back and giving me 2 nights free stay if I ever came back due to the situation. 

Apparently, the club is run by a separate corporation and is renting at Cosmo. So if something happens badly at Marquee while you're staying at Cosmo, Cosmo can't even do anything about it. The club even made the front desk person stand around to deal with it for an hour. By then it was principle, I don't care about $100, if I did I wouldn't be in Vegas. Considering it was daytime, the Marquee day manager can't deal with it, he has to talk to the night manager. WTH?

You're one company and your best answer is oh they worked last night so they aren't even awake yet. Wow that is pretty BS.  You make millions and I have to deal with this S--T like I'm a bum. I was pissed. 

I was unlucky that I hadn't charged my dinners at Cosmo to my room, or else Cosmo could have given all my money back without even speaking to Marquee.  It was a wasted exercise and it made the Cosmo people look stupid.

The communication between the 5star hotel, Marquee, two management teams for day\/night is f--kin ridiculous.

i dont think marquee is open on tuesdays but they were for the magic convention. as the newest club on the strip, i expected it to be extremely crowded and a big headache as all new clubs were. but it was actually not as bad as i thought.

of course the guys at the door are really uptight and act like big jerks, no surprise there. they all do at every club in vegas.  we got in pretty fast. we had a table reservation and the wait for it was pretty good. the table was on the outside part where the pool was. it was really really nice out there and im sure it wuld be awesome i the summertime. there was also a dj booth and a dancefloor out there wc was convenient. they had these really cool glass jacuzzis too.

the layout inside kind of reminded me of haze for some reason. the main dancefloor was a good size. the music was a good mix of hip hop that night and turned into more house music as it got later. the service was good. we had attentive servers.we had asked for a table inside after awhile because it got so cold and they accomodated us almost instantly.

one of the best ideas in that club was their photo booth. i guess they are the new thing now. they are so much more conveneint and so much fun to use. they had the whole set up with the props and everything.

As I mentioned in my earlier emails, I was looking for recommendations for a club with table\/bottle service for 40-50 year olds as it was my friends 50th birthday.  You sent me to Justen.  I did not know he only worked for Marquee.   He said the club was perfect for us and he would set us up with a ""great table"".  I even tipped him $100 on the way in...  

It was all 20 something patrons.  Not what we were told or even sold!!! They set us up with a table in the back corner by the bathroom.  It was horrible.  Couldn't have been further from the dance floor.  Not even in the ring. Then they triggered a fraud alert on my visa and they would not let anyone have any of the drinks even though they know we were staying in the hotel. What is that all about???   It took the waitress (Mary) over 30 minutes to re-process it. We were all standing there with our thumbs up our ass. 

Now the icing on the cake....Mary told me she was leaving for the night.  I signed the bill and included a 20% gratuity.  Then she comes back and asks for a tip for the bar back who kept up with the mixers etc...  She said the gratuity didn't include him.  I was so angry at that point that I just charged another $50 on my card.  Then I go to the bathroom and come back and our whole area was cleaned out and know one knew what was up.  I felt worked over and angry over the whole experience.  Disgusted!!!!

The next day on check out neither of you were around.  They had some manager from Marquee call me and he said he would give me $50 towards my next visit to Marquee.  Seriously?????

I will give 4 stars for the decor and the fact that it has high ceilings, multiple bars and an impressive outdoor area. But it wasn't worth the money. We stayed in the hotel and were told that we could get into a different line (faster moving) but still had to pay the fee. My BF and I stayed in a $1000k one bedroom suite for 4 days and the very least they could do is get us into the club. Anyway, the take you up in the elevator and drop you off at the club. A little tricky and confusing but there are two different music rooms. We were there early around 10:30pm so it was relatively early still. Once patrons started to arrive, it was like a mad house. The bouncers move people along the walkway not letting them stand or sit. All of the tables seem to be table service only. The dance floor is small so be prepared to get elbowed in the face, neck, arm, back etc. The outdoor area was nice but COLD (February). Throw in some more heat warmers people! Girls are in the shortest dresses and the least they can do is throw in more heat warmers so we don't huddle around like Eskimos. The only nice thing about this place were the bartenders.

Firstly, the stairs. It's a common gripe, I know, but it's seriously a pain. It's a fancy nightclub that girls will undoubtedly wear sky-high stilettos to, yet there are so many flights of stairs! 

Secondly, the hip hop floor is so small! I like it when clubs are popping with some good hip hop music, but I really don't want sweaty faces smashing against mine while I'm trying to bust a move. 

Thirdly, it can get so crowded that the bouncers literally tell you where you can and cannot walk. Especially when there is a famous DJ spinning on the floor that plays house music, you have to walk around the dance floor while the bouncers direct you away from running into it and jumping up and down with your hands in the air like you had intended to. 

Despite my three complaints, Marquee really is a beautiful club. The decor is stunning and its sheer size is impressive. Beautiful club, beautiful people.",1,2,0

We bought presale tickets to Kaskade's Summer Lovin' (dayclub) and Armin Van Buuren (nightclub)--I didn't even know I enjoyed EDM until I saw these guys spin--both shows were incredible. 

We did typical girl stuff--finagled our way into the VIP area, danced, took pics of ourselves, ignored drunken sexual advances, etc.--but somehow everything seemed 1000x better at Marquee than any of the other Vegas clubs. The line was a little crazy to get in on the night of Armin Van Buuren, which was irritating, but understandable for a holiday weekend. Other than that, I don't have many complaints. Marquee is a solid club that's earned its reputation. We will be back for more soon.

Other Pros: 
-Delicious strawberry daiquiris at the day club. The bartender didn't skimp on the booze.
-If you get there early you can get a great spot in shade right next to the DJ booth at the day club.
-For the most part, the crowd was respectable.

Other Cons:
-Delicious strawberry daiquiris were $15 each. Cheap for Vegas, but still a rip-off.
-If you don't show up early the lines are long even with presale tickets.
-A random drunk girl pushed me into the bushes near the pool and I bleed profusely. Not Marquee's fault, but crappy, nonetheless.",1,3,1

I do hate writing in a non-chronological manner, but I've saved up maybe 60 or so reviews and I'm unable to access the pics I need to jog my memory.  So, I figured I'd just do a review of a club I hold dear to my heart.]

You have to first ask yourself what you're looking for in a club:
- Cheap drinks? Try another place.  Or yelp a nearby casino that has good service if you play at their penny slots.

- Whores? Hmm, try another club.  Not sure I can leave a tip on this review, or I may get flagged ;)

- A good time?  It's who you are and who you're with, not the venue.

Well, I'm thinking too much on more things to check off the list, so without further ado, I will launch into my review of this fine hotspot.

Marquee has done a great job of recruiting\/stealing the top EDM DJs for events all throughout the year.  However, you'll only find some dancing space out in the patio area... or maybe a Monday night when its not Summer.  The main stage dance floor is usually packed, and you'll be bumping into people all night.  If you got 4-10k to shell out for a booth, then your girls will gain access to the platforms that line the perimeter of the main floor and divide the tables.  Someday...

The patio area is cool too.  You can get some fresh air, and stare at the hot roulette table dealers, or the table runners.  There's also a big screen toward the back that displays the main stage DJ, so you can enjoy his awesomeness without getting elbowed in the head by an overly enthusiastic fist pumper.  (Yea, I'm kinda short, so this happens a lot).

Expect long lines, as this is one of the hot spots.  BUT, if there's an event, pre-order your ticket online and get a wristband -- I got one that allowed access all throughout Labor Day weekend, and I went 4 nights in a row.  Ok, I didn't actually party hard every night -- I'd show up at midnight or so, and walked right in (no line with a wristband!).

Did I mention the bouncers are nice?  I guess I was impressed that the guy addressed me as sir -- it's the little things!

Oh, and one of those weekend wristbands will grant you access to the dayclub (pool party) too -- worth it's price if you go often.  Tip: If you ever wonder what the crowd is like, or the venue, just go on youtube.  Though it can't capture the great sound system they have.

Last tip: for dudes without chicks, go EARLY, get in, then LEAVE (with a handstamp).  Head over to the not-so-secret pizza place, or do some gambling, before making a timely re-entrance when the girls are a little more loose.  Up the escalator, there is an entrance for re-entries only!",2,1,0

Pros: Bouncers werent douches. I like the atmosphere of the Cosmopolitan and the futuresique of it. 

Cons: Bartenders don't know how to make drinks. You pay for a nice club and you buy 18 dollar drinks you expect them to be worth it. The drinks were made incorrectly. the cups were 5-6 oz plastic looking cups. I mean most clubs use plastic but they're like glass looking plastic cups, not the miniature beer pong cups size. So to compensate for the alcohol, the bartenders don't use any fillers. IE there wasnt tonic, in my gin and tonic ETC. It was like pure shots 

For example, the cup only fits 5 oz of liquid because they fill it with ice
unlike a 12 oz cup. 

An AMF has
1\/2 oz Smirnoff
1\/2 oz rum
1\/2 oz tequila
1\/2 oz gin
1\/2 oz Blue Curacao liqueur
2 oz sweet and sour mix
2 oz 7-Up® soda

1\/2 oz rum
1\/2 oz tequila
1\/2 oz gin
1\/4 oz Blue Curacao liqueur
1\/8 oz sweet and sour mix

And it's quite the pain to go to a table and gamble for free alcohol because its pretty far. 

I like my strong girly drinks damnit, even for a big guy I like to enjoy something I paid 20 bucks for.

Marquee is located inside the Cosmopolitan on the second floor. The line moves pretty steadily, and after they take your ticket\/check your name off, you take the elevator up to the club. This dayclub has a pretty nice layout. There are two main pools and three bars, and of course a bunch of tables\/cabanas around the perimeter and in the middle. The DJ stage is prominently in front of the last bar, and it's pretty easy to see from the biggest pool and all the tables. Also, I was pretty happy that there were plenty of places to find shade, and that one of the bars was inside and air conditioned.

Like most dayclubs, they provide you with towels, and you can purchase a locker to store your things safely. If you bring a bag that they deem ""too big,"" they'll force you to buy a locker. A smart thing to do would be to buy a waterproof phone pouch to wear around your neck - that way you can carry your valuables (phone, card, ID, cash) on your person while you leave your clothes to the side. 

TICKETS: If you are female, most likely you can get in for free! Males, don't lose hope, sometimes the guestlist allows for even ratio parties to get in as well. Make sure to book through a legit promoter; mine was Koco Nicole - (702) 420-6878 and she actually promotes through Marquee and responds quickly and gave me all the info I needed. 

DRINKS: There was an open bar for ladies, so luckily I didn't have to pay for anything, but some guy paid $22 for two cans of Corona Light! I think that's basically highway robbery. My only problem was that one bartender ignored the girls with open bar wristbands until it was past the time...but I do understand why he did that and I'm not going to complain about the free drinks I already downed.

Marquee doesn't disappoint as a dayclub. It is definitely fun to experience, and a surefire way to beat the heat.",6,4,4

That's like a dream come true! Well, to be honest, we were thinking of going to Vegas, but then when I saw that Markus Schulz was playing @ Marquee on  2\/15\/13, my boyfriend and I booked the package deal right away.

I bought tickets a couple weeks in advance just in case it ended up being sold out. The prices are ridiculous - $20 for girls and $50 for guys?! I wouldn't have minded the prices so much if the club experience was as good as I hoped it would be. 

Anyway, since we were staying at the hotel, we ended up getting to Marquee around 1am. With that being said, it was a breeze to get in since there was no line by that time. We had about 2 or 3 different bouncers ""escort"" us down some elevator (and if you watch the floors carefully, you will see that you pass floor 4.5). I have no idea why that exists, but it was pretty cool. 

Once we got inside, it was SLAM PACKED... I mean, there was no room to move. Since it was our first time, we didn't know where to go so we just started to make our way into the center of the dance floor. Little did we know that you are not allowed ""in"" onto the dance floor or be able to stand ANYWHERE... with there being 1 bouncer for like 5 people. They kept telling us to move no matter where we stood, but we literally had no where to go. Unless you pay for a table, you are shit out of luck if you get there too late. After a good 30 minutes, my boyfriend ""snuck"" past one of the big bouncers to get into the space that leads you into the dance floor. I tried walking through, but he just stopped me and told me I can't go in there. I literally had to beg him so I could go stand next to my boyfriend. After about an hour, we finally made it down to the front. During that time, I had all kinds of liquor spilled on me, was asked to move out of the way by a girl who said she's going to puke right now, got pushed and shoved in all kinds of directions, and saw some kid stealing money from a girls purse. 

If you don't mind all of that crap that we went through for an hour, then it was a REALLY good time because Markus had an absolutely incredible set. There is no denying that the sound system and the lasers are phenomenal, so it def helped with giving this place at least 3 stars.

Being from Chicago, we have a few amazing nightclubs very similar to Marquee (just not as big) but the biggest difference are the people. Marquee is  full of dirty people and douche bags. I was so disgusted after the night was over, i didn't even know what to do with myself. 

Regardless, we still had a great time once we finally found a good spot all the way up front. Unfortunately, I will not return to Marquee because it just isn't worth all the hassle. I am happy I got to check something off my bucket list, but that's where it stops for me.",1,1,0

There's a lack of communication between nearly everyone who should be playing a part in a creating a memorable Vegas club experience.  Our host took us through the whole club and dropped us off at a table miles away from any action, looked at his sheet and said ""oh, this isn't your table.""  Okay, that's fine.  We head back down to the pool area.  After ordering, it take nearly 20 minutes for someone to come back with our bottles.  From this point, the waitress pours our bottles into carraffes and ties linen napkins around them to distinguish them from our mixers.  Never seen that before, but I guess we're by a pool, so they don't want us to break bottles...so why give us glass cups?  Oh well.  The clincher was that one of their waitstaff must not have got the memo about the linen cloths and cleared our table of a quarter bottle of Goose and replaced it with club soda.  After some arguing, they made it right, but the whole situation was avoidable.  
Again, the place is pretty cool, but doesn't really have the 'wow' factor of some other places due to the fact they just don't quite have it together on the hospitality tip.  A great place to be seen, just not a great place to spend a ton of hard earned money, cuz you won't be treated well.",3,0,0

Pros: decent music from the headliner. awesome large, exterior patio. 

Cons: crappy mashup hip-hop house music before the headliner. the bathroom was a pain in the ass to get to from the outside. the main dance floor could be bigger IMO.

Tip: If you know you want to go to Marquee, just buy pre-sale tickets a few days ahead, and there is virtually no line at around 9-10 pm. If you do purchase pre-sale tickets, get your actual ticket on the first floor of the casino, jump in line on the third level (past the pizzeria), get yourself stamped, and then go back to your room to liquor yourself up and enter any time you want.",3,0,1

There are way too many tables at this place and not enough space for dancing.  The people that work there are extremely rude compared to other clubs in Vegas, and are less than willing to be accommodating to your needs.  The bathroom attendants don't do their jobs, and the bartenders make weak drinks.  The three floors of music sounded like a tight idea, but fails in their accessibility.  In order to go from one floor to another, you must walk through cutty, overcrowded, and narrow stairwells.  The layout of the club is extremely dumb, beware if you are claustrophobic, you just might freak out and die.  Our group felt caved in with the low ceilings and small dance floors.  If you want an excellent, spacious, and breathable environment go to another club such as XS or Tryst.

The line to get into the club is nuts, but very well organized and with helpful security, you know which line you should be in.  FYI for guys, if you are going to Vegas with guys only and think about not getting table service, make sure you try to team up with a group of girls that are in the same line with you.  Trust me, you'll get in the club faster, and thank the ladies with a round of shots when you get up there.  Remember, a group of girls will get into any club faster than a group of guys.  Back to the club.  The music was excellent, well I'm sure everyone reads the music was excellent, but what does that really mean?  To me, the DJ has a good flow, each song flows right into the next, so you don't lose rhythm.  If the DJ is good, and you have two left feet, you can still look decent on the dance floor.  Since it is a hot club, the dance floor is crowded and hot.  The security does a decent job of closing off the dance floor so it doesn't get overly crowded.  Had table service, the service was ok, but I have to give props to my security Sean, he was awesome and did an awesome job of keeping the riffraff out.  I'd figure the reason the service isn't that great is they already add a 20% gratuity to your tab, so since tip is already paid, the service doesn't have to be too good, nothing for them to earn.  I just stayed by our table and the main dance floor, didn't up go stairs to the library, which is a lounge area for people to chill, talk and play some pool.  Downstairs is a hip hop room, but didn't check it, so couldn't tell ya.  Just outside the main dance floor, they to have casino tables, so if you're out of luck with the ladies, you can try your luck at the tables.  The crowd was mostly Asian.

Overall: 
This place is as beautiful as you can imagine it, but I think it's a bit overhyped. It's definitely one of those places that you have to visit at least once because the outdoor view is unimaginable. It would also be nice if you had a lot of money to shell out and grab one of those cabanas to sit on. The lights, and trees and well lit buildings surrounding the club is beautiful, but I don't like how there are 3 floors. I liked how they did have different music on each floor that consist of techno, rap and a calmer billiard room (Library room), but I felt like my feet were going to fall off walking up and down those stairs throughout the whole night in 5 inch heels. Near the end of the night, I even tripped walking down the stairs once (super dangerous!) Besides the main floor, which is already scattered, the other rooms are really tiny as well. I'm also not a big fan of techno... I mean, I like the music, but it's hard to dance to it. Too bad most of the clubs nowadays have techno DJ's playing. I'm glad I was able to dance to the rap music in the smaller room for the short time I was there.

Drinks: 
EXPENSIVE! Obviously, club prices + Las Vegas = expensive, but add convention weekend = might as well just give away free money because you're going to be broke that night anyways. I remember paying $80 for 5 shots, and $30 for 3 beers. That's just ridiculous, but I'm not going to complain. It was just ridiculous especially since that weekend guys had to pay $50 dollars regardless (we went Friday and the girls got in for free, but if it was Saturday the weekend I went, girls would have to pay $30).",0,0,0

Spent a weekend in Vegas and our group made it a point to go to Marquee on Saturday night before we left.  We went at night and ended up going all out and doing bottle service.  Bottle service at this night club made XS look like garbage to say the least.  They even had Russian Jewel available which made Grey Goose taste like Smirnoff and my understanding was, at least in California, that it is no longer imported so that's a big plus.  The hostesses there are all gorgeous and friendly as well.  Our hostess was Natalie and she was amazing.  Always attentive to our needs and was there to sit down and chat with us and make sure our group had the best time possible.  Usually I had the idea that everyone working in Vegas would do anything to make a buck but here it really isn't true, at least not with Natalie.  What happened was I ended up drinking a bit more than i should have and opted to get another bottle for the table.  When the check came for it I hadn't realized that tip was already added so I added it myself.  The hostess however didn't even try to take advantage and made it a point to let me know that I didn't need to tip extra but in the end I did so anyway because the service was great, she earned, and I really appreciated it a lot.  Heck even if I wasn't trashed I would have thrown in that extra tip.  
Moral of the story.
Marquee is where you want to go when you hit Vegas and if you opt for bottle service definitely request Natalie, I guarantee you the best experience possible!",1,0,0

Is it Sin City that never sleeps or is it just me since it's 5 am in the SF Bay Area and the thought of writing reviews of my favorite party spots are blistering in my mind!? Anyways! I've had VIP service@Marquee and I've also been to the Dayclub which was phenomenal so I think it was time to share my experience with the masses! I must say the VIP service for the Nightclub was good but the table we had was terrible because it was crowded and small (Boombox Room... The actual dance floor was packed like sardines in a can).  What made up for it was the music, the company and the staff not giving a sh*t that I was standing on top of the seats shuffling like LMFAO was filming a music video inside! I even met some good friends who, coincidentally, were from the bay =) *wink*

The Dayclub, however, was the highlight of Marquee because I had an insanely good time with a mob of friends.  Live DJ on point, blackjack table on premise (which quadrupled my winnings) and no hassle experience that allowed me to jump in the pool regardless of whether I was in my swim trunks or not! That for sure put it over the top! (I did have swim gear but my toxicity level kicked in and I jumped in with no worries).  Marquee took top spot over Pure as my favorite Vegas club! Why wouldn't it since I've never partied so hard where my homie would end up leaving on a stretcher (points @ Frank H.! Hahaha)... #tweetthat",2,2,2

I was shocked at how big it was. I loved the somewhat outdoor area that was playing music for a hip hop loving crowd, while the EDM raged on inside the club. 

Benny Benassi was DJing when my group and I went on a Friday. We were a group of girls who were approached on the Strip by a promoter (I wish I could remember his name - truly top notch!) who gave us the royal treatment. We were given a table with bottle service, a waitress and all we could drink. We enjoyed the crowd, the music and the dancing and stayed at Marquee all night. 

Located pretty conveniently in the Cosmopolitan, it's not overly strenuous to get here. I know some clubs (looking at you Tryst and Wet Republic) make you walk about a mile in the hotels to get the nightclubs. That's not the case here. Get off the escalators and you're right here. 

DO NOT, I repeat, do not have a night out at Marquee without ending the night at Secret Pizza, also in the Cosmo. Find it, if you dare! 

Highly recommend Marquee as one of the best clubs in Vegas. I've been to 90% of them and let me tell you that this is one worth going to.",0,1,1

To start off, it is located in a good area of the Las Vegas Strip, The Cosmopolitan. It isn't too much of a far from any of the other most visited clubs in Vegas which is incredibly convenient. I recommend going on a Sunday instead of a Saturday-- due to the high volume of people. The vibe and music is never a let down and the fact that there's an indoor for EDM and outdoor for Hip-Hop is cool but if you do end up going on a Sunday, they don't play music outdoors since the amount of people isn't as much as it is on Saturdays!

The crowd came out with their A+ game with their attire.  There's a free photobooth just outside of the nightclub where you can feel like a ""Hollywood"" star with advertised background and such.  Dancers were terrific popping confetti and glow sticks into the crowd.  Probably the best part was the pool....just a work of art!

And they have a resting area that over looks the pool and the strip :)

I definitely recommend this place to everyone. 

I went this past labor day weekend and I guess that's one of the busiest weekends in Vegas and the admission for guys was about $50-100 and girls were $20-30. But I know on regular weekend nights its not as pricey. Girls are most likely to be free ;)",1,0,0

There's always a new club, Vegas is always reinventing itself, and our generation gets bored quickly.  But my experience at Marquee was so good that I have to say something.  Aside from it being gorgeous, over the top and larger then life, it's the staff that really stood out to me.  The doormen were the nicest I have ever met.  They weren't pretentious or mean, they greeted me with a smile and [gasp] even conversed with me.  Most doormen at Vegas think they are god, look at you like dirt and try their hardest to ignore you.  Little do they realize so many of them end up hand out cards on the strip.  But not Marquee! I hope they stay employed forever because they were genuinely nice.  They wanted all of us to have fun.  Even the guy taking us on the elevator to go up was pumping us up to have fun in the club.  

Its hard not to have fun in this club.  There are so many rooms to explore and music for all ears.  The Boombox is like Ghettoland where you can bust your bootay to hip top music and the main room feels likes a real concert with high end DJ's spinning on real turn tables (not clicking a button on an apple computer)  In the Library, you can get tables where you can actually talk, play pool, and even look down at the bumping bodies in the main room.  Outside is really cool too: bubbling jaccuzis heat lamps, bars, lighting - it looks like Vegas is portrayed in the movies.  My favorite was the main room, the DJ was so good!  Even though I'm not a huge house music fan, the mix up was full of enough familiar songs that I never got bored. Oh and the go go girls were HOT.  I'm a firm believer that every good LV nightclub needs pretty Go Go girls, it sets the mood.  This nightclub group does a good job of picking girls that also dance well and also making them wear lingerie.  I think tryst and XS's gold cocktail dresses are horrendous and they make their girls dance with these ugly jazz hands moves, its really not attractive.  I also hate when they just put up strip poles and let the customers dance on them- it looks trashy and they often have no rhythm and are fat but think they are hot.  Plus, then there is a crowd of dirty men taking videos of these poor girls panty shots

Oh and for some reason, we got lucky with the stairs because we caught an elevator down instead of having to walk.  But still I would recommend bringing flats since there are stairs to and from each room.  I can't wait to go back to Marquee, and hopefully they stay nice!",0,0,0

Saturday Night (yeee). Paul Van Dyk (amazing!). Party of 50 (!!).  Ladies free. Fellas $50.  Began the Marquee experience at 8:30PM.

Now, many of you might think..""that is way too early to get to the club"", because if you pre-party, your buzz is sure to wear off well before the club even gets packed.  I thought the exact same thing, but upon entering this gorgeous venue I saw the dance floor and my thoughts flew out of my mind and completely lost track of time.  Maybe it was the music.  Maybe it was being surrounded by my closest friends.  Maybe it was the bubbles that fell on us while we were dancing.  It probably was all of the above, but I think I'm going to give the majority of the credit to Marquee.  

For the people who aren't as excited about dancing as I am, I like that there are plenty of places to rest, including the Library Lounge upstairs (check out the balcony overlooking the dance floor) and the expansive patio.  There is a truly breath-taking view of the city lights from the patio that you can take in while sitting on their various cushy chairs (there's one that looks like a cracked egg, I like!) and sofas, a swimming pool, individual pools\/hot tubs, cabanas, and HEAT LAMPS (I think all ladies will appreciate)! 

But, the absolute best part of this club is that...it normally closes at 6AM...SIX IN THE MORNING...as in..it's basically like a buffet...of dancing. AYCD.  I'm a little too excited about this club, mostly because I just got back from Vegas and am suffering from withdrawals. But, I promise you.  If you love to dance and hate when venues close early, just get yourself over to Marquee, dress comfortably, and dance your heart out.

You have to retake the test. Don't pass the test- no ID! If I even asked for a plain Nevada ID for the meantime....that still takes 3-4 weeks to mail so it still wouldn't be in my hands. It's not instant like it used to be. It's not like I found a old NV ID from years ago and decided to dust it off for some local free drinks perks, it expired a few weeks ago. 

This is the first time this has happened to me since it's expired recently. Is it not the IDs purpose for the club purely verifying the age of the person? It's not whether I'm legal to drive currently.. It's a real ID (one of the newer NV ones that came out last year with the hologram) with my age on it- boom. In I go everywhere else (including their sister properties) so it definitely is just this particular bouncer deciding he wants to exercise his God hand as it's in their discretion only.

I could have gone all the way home, grabbed my passport and went all the way back, but such a place isn't worth the drive.  Nor am I giving them satisfaction a ant like me came crawling back wanting in even after being stepped on.

The bouncers here are complete pricks. Came here on a Saturday (12\/19) and I got my group on the guest list before 10:30pm and when we were at the front after 45 minutes of waiting, the bouncer grabs our slip and says ""okay, 5 girls 5 guys"". He doesn't even count and lets some random girl slip through, screwing up the ratio for our group. After seeing that our group numbers were off, he prevented 2 members of our group from entering and starts cussing and yelling at my friends and kicks them out of line. 

After a 2-hour fiasco of frantically trying all the other possibilities of getting the rest of our group in before guest list ended at 12, my friends were running around Cosmo getting different instructions from another bouncer who LIED to them about getting 2 free comps for being a hotel guest just to shoo them away and finally went from speaking to the front desk receptionists, the resort manager, and finally the hotel manager who escorted them to the front and finally got them in around 1am. 

The 7 flights of stairs up to this club are completely unaccommodating as well. STAIRS STAIRS STAIRS AND MORE DAMN STAIRS EVERYWHERE. My night was 90% stairs. Walking up to Marquee was like taking a trek to Egypt. After running up and down the stairs frantically trying to get the rest of my group up, I started getting a little belligerent in my 4 inch heels. The idea of being intoxicated in 4 inch heels and climbing and going down stairs isn't exactly an enticing one. The stairs aren't fancy club stairs either..it's like the ones you use during a fire escape. 

What's worse than walking up a gajillion flights of stairs is finally getting into a venue that completely sucks. This club is jam packed with sweaty people. Lost half our group again cause they cut people off from the pit.

Marquee has a pretty high ceiling with giant tvs, which makes it look a lot larger in pictures, but reality is not.  I bumped into people constantly.  The DJ table is right there in front of you and this makes it pretty cool though.  

Anyway, DJ Vice was spinning that night and he was GOOD.  He played from Wonderwall to Top40, in between he mixed with house\/techno music seamlessly.  He got me on the dance floor all night.

They won't take you down in the elevators until after 2 a.m. so we had to walk down a few flights of stairs (in stilettos) to exit. Once we got out of the club it was another nightmare trying to hail a cab.

--Walk around the strip during the day looking cute and a promoter will approach you. If they don't work for Marquee, ask them if they know someone who does (and they will). Contact this person and get on the list **this only applies if you are with all girls. 
--Eat an early dinner, pregame in your hotel, and arrive early (before 10:30). You will be escorted in free, no line or waiting. 
--Bring a flask with you if necessary to maintain your buzz throughout the night. 
--Go directly up to the pool area (the top) and hang out there. It doesn't get crowded and there tends to be nice, cool people hanging around this area. All other parts of this club are completely packed.

This review is from whatever I can remember, since theres no way I was sober that night ^_~

Place: Very nice and decorative. The main dance floor could be slightly bigger. The outside pool area looked real nice since you could see the surrounding buildings (Monte Carlo, City Center). Some of the VIP tables had jacuzzis with them. Yes, your very own glass jacuzzi, amazing. I vaguely remember the hip-hop room upstairs. I just remember the room being small, seeing some books, and a pool table. 

Music: The night I came here, EC Twins were opening open for Robbie Rivera. They were pretty good. We stayed til about 3:00am, so we only got to see Robbie Rivera for about an hour, hour 1\/2. 

Sound: Just perfect

Dresscode: Dressy shoes & collared shirt for guys. I was not able to get in with my black Vans. 1-1 Girl-Guy ratio (They're very strict on this one)
Normal price was $30-40 for guys I believe

Yes, I'd definitely come back. Yes I wish I can afford that VIP table w\/ the jacuzzi in the summertime. If you like house music, there are many many big house DJs that will be playing here.",1,1,0

The music is ok . And it's just a giant room with a pool and and tables around the pool no class . and girls looking like cheap prostitute l. Came in with a group of 8 and we left after 5 min . A real disappointment and I will let everyone in my City Chicago know this place didn't even come close to Chicago Night Clubs . Here is the kicker spend 700 hundred just for 2 cheap vodka bottles which they don't tell you . And when you sit down show you a menu with bottle list and it's goes up to $600 bottle for a bottle of Tequila . Huge let down I can honestly tell you Chicago makes this place look like a cheap bar. Money was not the issue it was principle and I felt like they didn't care about  their customers.  Walk up stairs and bought 3 bottles for $700... Danny Horal I hope you never make it to Chicago . Your people skills suck and you have no class with your cheap suite and gym shoes . Your suite you had was 3 suite sizes to small .

The club was pretty, the pool was pretty, the private bungalows were pretty. If you are going for pretty, this is the place. If you must go, get on the guest list. At least save yourself the 20-30 dollar cover. Use the internet to figure out how to do that.

I highly doubt that you will be able to find me here frequently after 9 pm though.

We had a Vegas newbie with us this past weekend and of course we had to show her the big, new strip hotel and the club! The dayclub was soooooo much fun, the crowd was awesome and despite the poor security guard in the main pool killing everyone' s buzz , the crowd overall was still a blast to hang with.  20+ beach balls all over the pool for everyone to hit - random splash wars and little clear stands in the pool that is large enough for about 3 girls to dance on just doesn't even begin to describe how fun my time there was. $48 for a drink pitcher\/$14 a pop or just look cute and you get it for free (well, not literally but you know what I mean).  The smaller pool has beds and about 1 foot deep and hey, drinks ARE allowed in the water over there.  The atmosphere was great and we had a blast.  I would LOVE to come back here again during the day.

Marquee Nightclub. Sigh...the place has sooo much potential but whoever designed the layout certainly hates women in heels. Seriously...Library and Boombox...you guys are so sweet but I don't feel like going up and down the stairs 20x just to see you again.  Then more stairs to exit...though one time we did manage to take the elevator out.  I'm not a fan of the crowd - I know you must be cool because you got in here, but so did I, which makes me better than you type of people.  Tons of girls, tons of Asian entourages, tons of cool kids who think they are too cool for school.  I'm in Marquee, b*tch. Main floor is so crowded, we go out to the pool but can't get in. Wahhh, I miss you dayclub!!!

Key to nighttime survival here: guestlist, come with good ratio (= no men), score drink tickets\/free tables (I love my girls), pick comfy shoes, study the venue and entrance map so you don't take 1 unnecessary step in the wrong direction (I am drafting one up as we speak), good attitude, acceptance of incompetent people, be a cool kid

I don't usually go partying, but my brother insisted we should check this place out. Turns out this night happened to be PARTY ROCK MONDAY! Guess what that means? A guest appearance by the man himself ""REDFOOO""! They usually have this every month on a monday. So lets put our hands up in the air and start waving them in the air while I start this review.

We called this place and they told us that the entrance fee was $50 dollars for guys. My brother looked at me and said.... Yo... this is your first time, i'll cover you and happy birthdayyy!. As we were walking towards Cospolitan, this promoter looking person told us he got tickets to the Marquee... all he asked for was a tip. So we were like lets give him $5 and see what he does...  he took our money and gave us the tickets and the night was on!

The venue was very nice! It had a outside patio and a pool for decoration! There's  a dance floor also, but it got full really quick. I had a nice time and met some nice people. Some of the residents of Las Vegas said that locals get in for free to most clubs in Vegas. Lucky Ducks! This club was a little different from what I'm use to. So you wait in line and then after awhile you are allowed inside a elevator that leads you up to the club. Let the dancing begin! Danced with this on girl, but after awhile she pulled out a cig and started dancing and smoking at the same time.... Reaaaaally.... who does that?.... I guess apparently she does. I guess the no smoking policy doesn't apply here. Total buzz saw... People were looking at her like... what the heck is she doing??? After that I needed a drink! Drinks are expensive here, but that's what is expected when you go to clubs in vegas.

After awhile, I told myself you can can't let one incident deter you from not having fun. Everything started to pick up again after RedFoo made his entrance.  He did DJ'ing and singing some hits from Party Rock! Night was saved!

The place inside is super crowded and there were times that you couldn't get on the dance floor because it was too packed.  The hip hop room is tiny and was super duper crowded (fire hazard status) because Lebron James was there.  I also hated the stairs and the stair climbing to get in and out of rooms and the club.  The drinks are priced at about $14-16 per drink depending on the alcohol but you can get free iced water from the dispensers around the pool area which is a plus.  My favorite part consisted of sitting outside the main restrooms (to rest my feet) and observing the crowd.

To start it off it was around 11AM on a Saturday and we had guest list admittance. Walking in you'd see the IV station set up advertising vitamin infused IVs set up by what I am assuming were LVNs. Going further through out the lobby you'd see the darker side of the bar illuminated by natural sunlight of the roof top pool. The drinks were harder to get to, a small wait however not to bad regarding the amount of people. The bartender was friendly and new how to mix well, my AMF being well crafted however ranging at the standard Vegas price of $22!

We made our way to the locker room where they held a bunch of small lockers on a dip near the bathrooms which lead all the water to soak on the bottom. Great place to slip and slide among a crowd of people needing to pee. 

The music was decent upstairs, the in pool bar kinda dangerous and the pool extremely crowded.

I had contacted a promotor\/host a month prior to get everything squared away. And everything was a go.  Once we got there, on time, I meet up the promotor and he talks to his manager or whoever...that guy tells us that they have closed the patio area due to high winds. And that was where we were booked to have our table. So now we have LOST our table.And they can't move us inside or do anything about it. And the best part I didn't even get a phone call or heads up in advance. SO unprofessional!!! I asked him if we could even pay more money to get a table and he said no. He said the best thing he can do is let us in as ""early bird"" table. Which is to sit at a table until the people that book that table comes and we get kicked out. At this point we were all dissapointed. So went ahead and just sat at the early bird table.  The entire time me and another girl was trying to contact people we knew to get another table and we were going up and down those retarded flight of stairs at least 4 times that night.Finally we gave up and it has been over an hour. I didnt really get to dance a lot and enjoy my night because of their unprofessionalism.  We left a little after and once I got back to my hotel, we all decided to go to The Bank at Bellagio. I realize that I don't have my ID and Marquee had kept it. Usually they keep your ID when you have a table and give you ID back when you close out the bill. SO why the hell would they keep my ID if I didn't have a table? Are they that retarded? So after a horrible time there, I had to go back and track down my ID. I had to talk to at least 5 people before they would let me in and talk to the hostess who had my ID to get it back. I finally struggle my way to get throught the crowded club and the girl doesnt even remember me and said she doesn't have it. Just f*cking great. I had to go back out and explain to other people that the hostess doesnt remember me and doesnt have my ID. At this point, one of the door guys personally take me inside to talk to the hostess. And it was so crowded that he couldnt even get to the table so he got someone else to do it. We stood there for a good 15 mins waiting, then he tells me wait here, ""i gotta go do something i'll be back"" I wait for another 20 mins, so i got a chance to stand there and fist pump for a bit. he comes back and tells me...theyre still working on it. Lets go back outside and wait. OMG. SERIOUSLY?! We get outside and he said wait around and we'll see where it is. Im thinking to myself, this is not getting anywhere. So my friend gives him her number and tells him to txt or call when he gets it. Im sure that he wont anytime tonight.  So I go back to my hotel bummed out and thinking I cant even drink my sorrow away cause I have no ID. yeah venue was pretty, music was cool. but bouncers were jerks and the whole damn place is just too hyped.

Bunch ass drunks spilling drinks all over my legs & dress. If you want to get to the dance floor, tip the greedy bouncer, otherwise good luck. You have no where to stand because Bouncer kept telling everyone to move along. NOTE: Marquee is a ripoff. They tell you to your face that they will refund your money to your credit card if you decided to pay them now at the window. LIES. I just got an email from them last week along with attachments as to the reason why there's no refund. Buyer's beware.

I think Marquee is shady. Plus it's dam ridiculous that everyone has to walk up 10 flights of stairs (not lying here) to enter the club. So weird. Not sure if I'll ever go back. XS is way better and more beautiful.

We were there 1 1\/2 hr before he starts and they already blocked the dance floor and we can't even walk\/squeeze through the crowd along the perimeters & bars to breathe.

I HATE MARQUEE. Stole my money and over capacity. They owe me dinner or something. Don't care to go back. I can still see those great DJs at Insomniac events, Avalon, etc. here in L.A.

We stayed at Encore and did not get in for free to either XS or Tryst simply because we were hotel guests. (now we get in for free because we know one of their top servers personally)

I loved Marquee.  Not as good as XS or Tryst but better than Hakkasan at MGM in my opinion.  There are lots of areas to explore.  My only gripe is the terrible stairs.  I understand the need for stairs in a place like this but dress it up a bit!  It reminds me of stairs in an old high-school.

Our favorite room was the BoomBox room - hip-hop and a lot of fun.  I did not get to see the Library or at least I don't remember lol.  Drinks are typical $20 each so pre-party to get your buzz on before coming to the club and prepare for a lot of walking.

As this place is ""dress to impress"" make sure your clothing is on point, especially your shoe game fellas. As for me, I was decked out in the typical Vegas attire, short dress & high heels, brutal! I was dreading the formidable stair climb that a lot of other reviews highlighted but was able to bypass that whole debacle by taking a nice, comfy elevator ride up! I was thanking my lucky stars and happier my feet were still holding it down while parading about on 4 inches of hell. Seriously guys, it's TORTURE.

Bitching aside, I was enamored with the outdoor area of Marquee. The space, lighting and music was all very Vegas-ish. The crowd that night wasn't rowdy and a fairly good mix of people. Drinks showcase your typical Vegas price tags as to be expected, I think 5 drinks were around $60-$65. If that's too steep for you, you can always pre-party in your hotel room which usually proves to be entertaining and a hell of a lot cheaper.

I can't say much for the inside of the venue as I spent the majority of my time outside. BTW although it was January, oddly enough I didn't find myself freezing - thank you global warming! Another key piece of info: if you don't get a table\/bottle service you can find some place to semi-sit along the ledges of planters.. Hey, ballin' on a budget - do what you gotta do.

Anyway, after a couple of hours my feet couldn't take the pain and were redlining the brink of ""Hammer Toe"" look in the morning. So, to  hell with looking super, super cute, I busted out my flip flops and was a happy camper and more importantly prevented the ill-fated blister foot. Besides, there were plenty of other girls who were happily dancing in their flip flops too.

Just make sure you get on a guest list so you can get in free, which isn't hard with the masses of promoters scouring the city.

Also, make sure you get there early. I walked in after a 5 minute wait and that was at about 10:30. It was a little strange looking for the 3rd floor entrance though.

Being one of two open clubs on Christmas Eve, my friends and I chose Marquee due to having free guestlist for both men and women. However, because of this, the line to get in was LONG!! It seriously felt never ending because the moment we got out of one line, we were moved into another - I was so shocked! My friends who were seasoned Vegas club veterans told me that they had never waited that long (about an hour and a half) to get into a club.

Once we got in, it was no surprise that it was packed. Andrew Rayel was playing, and although he's not my favorite, he threw down a lot of big room house music which, if you're drunk enough can be a great time since it's lighthearted and easy to dance\/flow to. Drinks were very expensive, but I guess I expected that. However, if you make friends, especially with a table, people are down to share :)

As for the actual venue, it was smaller than I expected! The outdoor area was open which was nice to get some air, but the indoor area was quite small with not a lot of room to dance due to being mostly filled with tables. I guess I understand because that's where they make a bulk of their money. Just a bummer if you can't make friends with a table since it gets packed and claustrophobic.

However the interior is decorated beautifully. There were amazing go-go dancers who were dressed up like candy canes for the holidays who were just beautiful goddesses! Once our dancing shoes were fueled up with some alcohol, my friends and I had an awesome time. Definitely excited to come back for another Vegas clubbing experience soon!",4,2,3

Me and my friends bought presale tickets. $50 bucks for guys and $40 bucks for the girls. Knowing that it was gona be packed we got there at like 8:30 PM (club opened up at 9 PM). When we got there, there was already a huge ass line that I didnt even see the end of, but since we had presale tix our line was only like 10 people deep. A girl came by to us one on one to check our tickets that we printed out and we were inside the club within 10 min of it opening. 

We took an elevator to God knows what floor. Upon entering there was a bar right as we exited the elevator. Sum of us checked in our coats which was I believe 5 bux per item but don't quote me on that. 

Walked towards the main room after that where they play all the house music. They've got all the biggest  house Dj's in the world playin there like: Eric Morillo, Chuckie, Axwell, Kaskade, Steve Angello, Benny Bennasi, etc. There's two big bars in that main room as well as a dance floor and a shit load of tables for bottle service. In front of the dance floor is a stage like setting where the Dj's spin, and behind them is like a 40-50 ft. LCD screen. 

Went up to the library which was above main floor since the club was still empty. They got a bar in there with a few tables as well as a pool table which was free to play which we played a few games. Theres also a balcony looking over the dance floor of the main room. Also had a separate DJ playin hip hop. 

On the bottom floor, theres the Boom Box room which is bigger than the library. It has a bar, dance floor and tables surrounding the dance floor and its own dj playin hip hop.

Awkward thing was when you go from floor to floor to each separate room, you have to walk  up and down these stairs which isn't good when ur drunk. 

Finally around midnight or so, they opened the patio in the main floor and it was beautiful. Not as big as the patio in XS, but just as nice in terms of how its decorated. During the summer time they're gona have sum rockin as pool parties in the patio area so start hitting the gym!!! Theres a bunch of cabanas and lounge areas in the patio as well as a couple of bars. 

One thing I noticed about Marquee is that the girls that went there were all pretty damn good looking. Not sure if it's cuz it was opening weekend and its the newest hottest club or what but i was blown away. Dont remember how much the drinks were but its vegas so you better expect to drop sum money. 

All in all you gotta check it out especially if you like house music, this place is built for house music on the weekends with all their lights,40 ft. led screen, and sound system. I believe monday nights they have hip hop and r&b performers.

As we approached the door we were invited to join a table about to walk in. As the whole table was escorted through the velvet ropes we followed and the rope was closed behind us. Then a host walked up and asked us to go back to the other side of the ropes. We were not allowed in with the group and told to wait by the host.

Bottle service is pricey, but totally worth it; having your own space in between dance sessions is so key (especially when your stilettos start to rage war on your feet). As for the music, put it this way: when my girlfriends and I were out dancing we kept waiting for a bad song so we could go hydrate.

I sent the letter below to guest relations for both the Cosmopolitan and Marquee over a month ago and received no response. This club is dangerous, unethical, and unsafe. Furthermore, they seem to only care for patrons who are straight. It's 2015, this behavior is unacceptable. 

Dear Management,

I am writing to you today in regards to an incident that occurred at the Marquee nightclub, located in your hotel. On the night of 10\/17\/2015, I entered Marquee with my male cousin and a female friend. 

A group of female friends of mine were celebrating a bachelorette party and had purchased a table for the night. I was invited by the group to come by the table and celebrate with them.

Upon entering the table area, located to the left of the DJ booth, a security guard immediately grabbed my cousin and I and pulled us out of the area forcefully. Due to his actions, I almost fell over and bumped into one of my female friends. 

The security guard then told us that this was a table reserved only for women and we had to leave. After informing him that the table was paid for by my friends and they had personally invited me, he continued to push us violently away from the table. 

This action was shocking and upsetting to me and the women at the table. The security guards actions were aggressive and inappropriate and he had no right to violently touch me and my cousin. The entire party found this action unprofessional, sexist, and incredibly dangerous to our safety as patrons of your establishment. 

I know certain nightclubs in the Las Vegas area grant free admission to women in hopes of enticing male patrons. Some staff may have seen two men near a female group and thought that they were a ""threat"" to business. However, as a gay man I also find this behavior sexist and homophobic. 

I would like to speak to whomever is in charge of safety and\/or guest services so we may resolve this matter. What should have been a memorable night for all those involved turned into an upsetting event. My friends and I are apprehensive about frequenting your hotel as we are concerned for our safety due to this event. 

We are planning to be in Las Vegas from 11\/20-11\/22 to celebrate another bachelorette party. I hope your establishment can convince us that you welcome all patrons regardless of gender or sexual orientation. If you would like to speak to another witness of this event, I'd be happy to provide you with their contact information.",10,7,3

We went on Monday to Marquee and they had their VIP line wait while the club filled to capacity. 2 hours later (don't ask why we stuck it out, I still have no clue) the club did not honor the guest list because it was after midnight by the time we arrived.  So guys paid the special VIP rate of $40 and girls paid $20.

Marquee is a 7,000 capacity nightclub, and there were probably 10,000 people crammed in. The VIP area IS the dance floor, but if you don't get a VIP wristband (which we did not, because we were after the midnight cutoff), security does not let you onto the floor. You're basically allowed to walk around the perimeter and go buy drinks. Felt a little scammed.",4,3,0

My friends and I were here for a night to celebrate a friend's birthday...
We arrived semi-early and saved so much time being on the guestlist; and having more ladies in our party than men. Ladies got in for free; and our boys had to pay $25 each.

We went through the maze that eventually led us to a bouncer, who escorted us in our own lift to the CLUB.

it was a WHOA... It's like a mini hotel turned club. So huge. So spacious, you could literally panic if you lose your group from the whole mass of party-goers.

Our feet were itching, our hips were about to bust out...we had to dance..we saw the first dance floor and mixed in with the pool of body sweat and hair flips and booty grinding and arms lifting and crotch kissing. This area played House music\/Electro\/Techno so it was FUN getting hit by all these bright strobes of light bouncing off the disco balls and the walls.. BUT... I was so concerned with my skin toned satin platform pumps I couldn't bang out like these drunk happy people. Maybe i wasn't too drunk yet.

Moving on, we sort of stood and walked around the outside area wherein, you see the strip....Amazing View... 

Then we took some stairs down and found the hip hop room... Aaah. if you think the House Room is packed. This one is eeeven more packed.
And the bouncers here are mean. Like they're some bomb diggity ballers.

At Marquee, you oughta be prepared to spend lots on alcohol. I mean. Paying about $32 for 2 shots.
And Ladies... buy some Dr. Scholls and put them in your shoes. I swear it helps. There's a lot of stairs in this club. so Yes. Wear comfy pretty heels. Or. JUST SUCK IT UP.

The Library room is pretty chill. The servers are dressed like Librarians (duh) and they're super nice. You can play pool, listen to chill music or, go to the balcony and overlook the club downstairs while you light a cigarette.

Overall, It's pretty fun to experience what the new big thing in Vegas is... But... I'm afraid it'll be so over-rated and it'll lose it's classiness.
Coz i think it's almost there.",4,1,1

I had booked a table with Amber Anderson, Customer Development Manager at Marquee Nightclub, on April 11th.  I explained that were 4 girls and would need a table.  She quoted me $1k - she stated $500 was an average table and $1k would get a better location. It was important for me to book the table well in advance given I was planning the party and wanted to ensure my guests would have a good time.

I communicated with Amber several times leading up to the 28th.  My last text with her to confirm the booking was at 9:15pm on the 28th.  Her response was ""see you later"". We arrived for our table at 11pm.  We were told to wait in the line for the table... the people in front of us said they had been waiting 50 minutes.  I asked a Marquee employee why a table reservation still had to wait and his response was to text our host if we wanted to get in sooner.  I texted and called Amber a total of 7 times with no response.  (Additionally, someone from Marquee told her I had arrived and she made no attempt to come greet me).  After approximately 1 hr we left Marquee.  I understand this is Vegas - however, this kind of service is appalling and ridiculous.  

This was an important event for me -- Marquee and Amber destroyed our evening.  In the short term Marquee will get away with the crappy service.. however, they will fail to have loyal customers once the fad passes.

Finally, the Marquee experience reflects poorly on The Cosmopolitan. I booked the Cosmopolitan because of Marquee.  I will never again stay at the Cosmopolitan given their association with Marquee.",4,0,0

I bought a pre-sale ticket, showed up PRETTY EARLY in terms of Vegas time between 9-10PM and got in IMMEDIATELY. I like how there's an outdoor section and it's high up so you can see the Vegas skyline.

I didn't like how there were several areas and floors and it's super easy to get lost or lose your friends. There's music inside, outside, downstairs, upstairs, what is going on? There were people everywhere too and it personally added to my semi-confusion about where people were suppose to congregate. I didn't get to thoroughly appreciate how nice it is outside with the running water and the couches and stuff since I spent a majority of my evening getting figuratively and physically beat up on the dance floor. 

Some girl GRABBED ME and said ""HEY, ASSHOLE, THIS IS HER BACHELORETTE PARTY! DON'T BUMP INTO HER."" I remember adamantly apologizing SINCE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT only to realize that girl was a massive piece of shit.

Seems like people didn't get the memo about Vegas clubs.. Here it is: Any time you go to a club in Vegas, expect to pay for overpriced drinks, expect some bouncers to be dicks and expect big crowds. If you have a problem with any of those three expectations, then you're better off going to a bar or lounge. Not to say that you're going to run into all three at once for Marquee, but expect it so it won't ruin your night.
  This past weekend I was able to go to both the Day and Night club. It's a fun experience. They did a job well done with the amount of space given for the club. I enjoy the fact that you can go inside and outside for the night club. The dance floors for both the hip hop and main floor get crowded fast (avoid hip\/hop if you're claustrophobic), so I'm usually outside for the main floor where I could see and hear the DJ spin. 

 If you want a good drink for the price you pay, make sure you ask for Jason (coolest bartender) and ask him to make you a Liquid Marijuana. He's the only one that knows how to make it really good! If you go to the day club, ask any one of them bartenders for the Beach Bum (that's also a good drink). They're like $14 which is reasonable for a club drink.

Girls --- Not to discourage you from going to this place with your beautiful high heels, but beware this place has lots of stairs to go from hip hop to main. Make sure the elevator takes you to the main dance floor, and I advise you to stay there. The Boombox room isn't that worth it unless you only like top 40's and don't care for EDM. Also, if you need to sit,  outside there's these concrete planters that you can sit on OR you can act like you're gonna gamble on the 21 tables and sit there lol.  

Guys -- for the day club DO NOT take any bags\/satchels\/purses\/backpacks they will NOT allow you up the pool until you put your shit in their lockers which is $30 (not worth it).

1. The line was unbearable, we were in line for 2 hours. And if you are a woman beware, security was watching people and telling them to put their heels back on if they were off. I don't expect for bouncers to be friendly but this was unreasonable for half of the girls there who feet were barking before they even got in the door. Ladies bring an extra pair of shoes to make the night bearable.

2. The cover was $50 for women and $100 for men. Maybe this isn't the norm but for my experience that was crap regardless of them not closing until 6.

3. Drink prices are ridiculous! The drinks were watered down and small with a $14 price tag.

4. The DJ was very unprofessional in the hip-hop room. I'm not expecting DJs to have the ethics of a saint but letting your friends crowd around you and screw up with the music of an already overpriced club doesn't make me happy. And they played the same songs over, and over, and over again.

Him: Leaving so soon?
Me: Yea, there's just so much electronica, and we really just want to dance to some hip hop.

I'm giving this place 2 stars because I think it's a nice club and they were pretty efficient. However, I think the security guards are pretty stupid and their rules are dumb.

I'll give you guys a quick story: My friends birthday so we obviously had to make sure he has a good time, get's drunk, and doesn't remember anything. We pre-gamed a fair bit but still got to Marquee in time for the promoters guest list. We get in and the guy continues to drink more with the free drink tickets all our girls got. I believe he had 2 drinks. We go to the restroom and we are all ready to go in and have a good time. Well as normal as this birthday boy seemed to us and did not do anything abnormal but stick out as a tall Mexican guy with a group of shorter Asians, he get's pulled aside randomly for being too drunk and obnoxious and he get's kicked out. He was not falling, he was not slurring, he was not doing anything that makes him seem drunk but hang out with a group of Asians (it's a major sin in sin city apparently-jk it's not). Anyways, we talk to the security guards and they withhold his drivers license until he is out of Cosmo completely. THATS RIGHT, Drivers License confiscated and X marked on his wrist (which means you are drunk and kicked out and can't go into any clubs anymore apparently-i'm not sure). 

Anyways, I am giving this place a 2 star based merely on that experience because I didn't really get an experience beyond the bathroom doors because of the unreasonable security guards at Marquee. I'm sure I would've given this place a better rating had it not been for this incident that will ensure I will not return. 

Tips: 
1) Don't stand out like a sore thumb or you will be targeted to be kicked out without reason
2) Have a good guy to girl ratio (2-1 girl to guy) so I've heard
3) Have fun and get drunk
4) Buy Bottles ! (that helps at all clubs)

Ok so I will say that this birthday boy was indeed drunk and blacked out, but, he acted so normal under those circumstances that no one in our group saw anything abnormal out of him. Especially since we just came from the bathroom. So if we all thought he was sober and not drunk, how can someone else think he is? 

Either way, not too happy with this experience. Not throwing money at anyone just because. I heard it gets packed and there's not much space anyways. I'll find another club to go to when I return..I like SLS.",1,0,0

My girlfriends and I were on a guest list & got right in without any problems or wait. We ended up bumping into old friends from our hometown out by the pool, and they so happen to have rented a cabana so this was a + for the night. Before we ran into them, we were at the outside bar grabbing a drink. The bartender was great - came right up to us even though there was a big crowd standing next to us. Drinks were tasty, & from what I remember, not too expensive for Vegas. 

Dirty South was spinning and I would have liked to have been in the main room by the time he came on, but still had a great time outside in the cabana.

I was a little shocked at the amount of young, sloppy drunks running around, considering this is supposed to be one of the top nightclubs in Vegas. But didn't lose any sleep over it ;) 

The Cosmopolitan is a BEAUTIFUL new chic hotel and walking through it before we came here was very intriguing. I'm coming back in May and will most likely plan a night out here again.

P.S. I remember the taxi line not being long at all at the end of the night, which was a definite + when you've been dancing around in 6 inch heels all night & want to get back to your hotel fast. We stayed at the MGM so 2 minute drive :)",1,1,1

This past trip however ... was full of disappointment. We were on the guestlist...and still waited a good 45 mins in line. This place was super crowded by 11ish and we literally had to push through the crowds to get through to the clubs. 

My friends weren't having it that night and couldnt stand the music so we went in search for the Hip Hop \/ R&B room. After their many flights of stairs, we finally get to this teeny tiny room that was probably 900 sq ft. We were seriously rubbing elbows with these gigantic size chicks dancing around us. Dance for less than 15 mins and bounced.... but guess what ? Couldnt just bounce ... had to trek through miles of stair cases before finally leaving that damn club.

The negatives (and they are HUGE negatives):

- MASS chaos on all bagillian levels of the Cosmo that have entrances into the club. Follow the mob of hundreds of people on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floor trying to get in. It's so ridiculous that the club actually hires people to stand with signs that have arrows pointing people in different directions- table service that way, promoter lists this way. Like a bad amusement park. Once you actually get into the line you belong in, you realize you're a million miles away from the front door. FUN.

- the layout of the club irks me so bad. Okay, so it's obvious the people over at Cosmo have a ton of $$$ and can afford to create a hot club but DAMN can we say huh for a minute. For a club so huge, the dance floors are STUPID small, like oops, we forgot to put in a dance floor! Let's slip one in here. Thousands of people and you want me to dance where?! And the club is a maze. Which floor is wha? What's around that corner? I've been a couple times sober and still got lost. The layout just doesn't make sense to me. 

The positives:

- tons of big name guest DJ's. IF the DJ that night plays your kind of music expect to have a badonks night. If not.. well.. find somewhere to sit. Like on top of their trashcans. (No joke. Don't judge.)

- it's pretty freakin gorgeous outside. I love the outdoor space as much as XS's. Mini-pools, strands of lantern lights dangling above, an amazing view of the strip.. it's so sexy. I wish they'd carried the same thought inside.

- the crowd is really cool, not necessarily the most diverse, but surprisingly laid back. And since the club has so many different rooms and patios it's easy to start conversations with people and score free drinks. Kidding!!!

I've been on both the bottom and the top of the club door hierarchy - no hookup, got there late, trying to stand in line, all the way up to promoters, getting there butt early and table service. What I've learned: No hook up? No table service? Skip Marquee. It's DEFINITELY not worth the wait. Otherwise, go ahead..I mean sure, why not?",6,8,6

We are staying in a suite that overlooks it, so had to listen to construction all Thursday and Friday as they prepared for their Halloween event. What we didn't realize was the loud outdoor music would be played all evening that we would also get to hear while we slept. Ugh

Saw the opening Friday night and enjoyed the vibe. Watched the doors open Sat which included loud music at 11:30am (when can we sleep). Vegas party crowd slowly arrived and by 1pm it was starting to hit its stride. We are literally overlooking the area so we can see what is occupied and not in use. Called to get a table or cabana (we haven't even discussed price yet!). After text messages with Justen (take 2 freaking minutes to call me back) we get that they've been open since 11:30, and everything is booked so what should we expect?  Hmmm...I can see many spots NOT in use, but ok. 

Worse service we have had from the Cosmopolitan. Find another company to manage the marquee as the concept rocks, the customer service does not meet expectations. Going to rock out from our terrace for free instead. 

After checking it out in the evening, deduced it was the worst experience ever. The dj was awful so we left quickly (pick a beat, a rhythm, or a genera dude). Had to walk many flights out after wandering the dark maze with no signs to find an exit. FAIL",1,4,1

Marquee Nightclub: (2 stars) 

Music: Armin was the DJ of the night and since I am a huge fan of Armin there are no complaints on this aspect!

Attendees:  In the words of Magic, Why do you gotta be so RUDE?!!!!
The nightclub was full of rude & inconsiderate people on Sunday night!  I was literally stuck in the front of the stage for more than 2 hours because no one would let me get out. I am not one to resort to violence but seriously people need to just calm down and move aside for people! I had a friend that went on Saturday for Kaskade and she said that it was just as bad if not worse! People need to remember that we are all there for the same reasons and that is to have fun and enjoy the music, so I hope people can learn to be more courteous!

Security: Thank you for pulling me out of the crowd when no one would let me through & thanks for saving me from the creep that was harassing me !


Marquee Dayclub: ( 5 stars)

Music: I really like Tritional's singles, but this was my first time ever seeing Tritional live and I thought they were really good. Although they are not as big as Kaskade and Armin they still managed to put on a good show!

Drinks: It was open bar for ladies so I took full advantage of it! Although all drinks were free from 1-2pm on Labor Day, remember to be courteous and tip the bartenders it just feels like the right thing to do. 

Security: Clumsy me managed to lose my wallet, but the head of security conducted everything in a professional manner and  eventually everything worked out because a kind soul turned in my wallet ! 

Attendees: Everyone seemed to be really chill and much more enjoyable to be around in comparison to those from the night before.

It's a great idea to have three different rooms of different kinds of music....but

-expect to get drinks split on u
-toes stepped on
-barely have room to walk
-and wait in ridiculously long ass lines, even if ur on the guest list

*my favorite was the hip hop room*

If they had less ppl there I'm sure it woulda been a better experience for me, but barely having any room to dance or breathe kinda hindering my chances of a good time.

*sexy ass waitresses and bartenders 
*good looking crew
-got kinda a snotty vibe from most ppl tho
-ppl all seemed kinda irritated due to the lack of breathing room

Seriously, once there was a line that seemed to be a mile long, going down to where the giant stilletos are.  I always wanted to check out the club, but could not imagine standing in line for an hour plus, in heels, then have to pay some ridiculous cover.

Hands down, number one, best way around this?  Bottle service.  Yes, I know the litany of reasons why bottle service seems dumb, i.e., it's an obscene amount of money for a bottle that you can buy at the store for a fraction of the cost and feeds into the crazy Vegas club culture that allows the clubs to charge an arm and a leg.  

I don't care about being front and center, but bottle service means no line, no wait, no cover, and premium real estate, i.e., a place to dance with no pushing, elbows, being stepped on, or drinks spilt on me.  But best of all, it means a place to sit down when the song sucks, my feet start hurting or I just need a moment to relax.  To me, bottle service (albeit, split among friends) is worth it every once in a while, and especially at the current hot spot like Marquee. 

So under this context, Marquee was AWESOME!!!  My group got in as soon as we got to the entrance, and were whisked up right away.  (No line, no wait, no cover.)  The service was amazing.  Our hostess was really nice and friendly, was constantly by, and danced with us.  The bus boy was also super attentive, quickly clearing away glasses, cleaning the table, replenishing the ice, and reorganizing the mixers.  (Seriously, I think he replenished the ice like ten times.)  The security guards were also cool guys.

We were in the hip hop room; the DJ was pretty good and spun a mix of current hits and throwbacks.

The only downside was having to walk down the stairs to leave, but it is not uncommon at Vegas clubs (e.g., Tao, Lavo).  Seriously, I have to imagine that people eat it on the stairs pretty frequently, but I digress.  

Overall, I had a blast at Marquee.  I don't know if it was the club, the ambiance, the music, the bottle service, my company, or a combination of all of the above, but it was one of THE best times I've ever gone out in Vegas.",4,2,2

Location - At the Cosmopolitan. Super convenient if you're staying at the center of the strip. We walked over from Planet Hollywood...nice easy walk. You will need to walk up several flights of stairs to actually get to the club. Good luck if you're wearing heels.
Dance floor - So small!!! I was shocked by how tiny the dance floor is. I understand that these clubs are geared towards bottle service and tables, but come on. The dance floor was way too crowded and way too small. Whoever designed this place clearly wasn't thinking straight.
Staff\/service- The male bartender at the bar outside was great. Really nice guy. The female bartender by the elevator was very rude. The security people are kind of annoying...there was no more room on the dance floor and they didn't want anyone standing near the walkways or behind the VIP tables. So where do they expect us to go???? 
Bathrooms - Clean. The ladies in the women's bathroom were very attentive, always had a paper towel ready for you after you wash your hands.
Drinks - Good. I was actually surprised by the prices. Drinks are very expensive in Atlantic City so I was expecting them to be even more expensive in Vegas. The prices really weren't that bad. And there wasn't a minimum to use a credit card. Maybe I was just ordering cheap drinks??? lol
Lines - There was no line to get in the club. We ordered tickets ahead of time though so I think that really helped. We walked in around 11:30pm. Lines for the bar weren't bad either.
Coat check - We didn't take advantage of this. We called ahead to find out the cost - $40 for guys, $20 for girls. That is INSANE. Who would pay that? I really hope that there was a miscommunication and that was the price to get in the club, not for coat check.

After about an hour or so trying to find a space on the main floor, I'll usually head down to the Boombox room which is a smaller floor where they play hip-hop. There's a bar on this floor too, as well as some VIP table area. It's not as big or extravagant as the main floor but I like it a lot better since I'm a bigger hip-hop fan. There's also a bathroom right outside so you don't have to walk through waves and waves of people just to freshen up.

In all seriousness, if its a big name DJ, get to the dance floor early and stay there. Dont leave or you might not get let back onto the dance floor. The area in front of the stage is small and gets super packed on a good\/busy night.

**As you can tell I didnt have much fun there that night, HOWEVER, that was for Kaskade on a Saturday night... I went back on monday to see W&W and the place was AWESOME. Plenty of space in front of the stage, didnt get herded around in a circle by security and had a blast.

I'm not big on clubs in general, but when in Vegas, I like to do my hair, put on a short dress, and go dance until my quads give out.  My first night of this same trip, I had a great time at XS - I'm not just an old lady grumbling about clubs.

I am grumbling that this particular club, due to its status as Vegas's newest, is an unenjoyable clusterfuck, with people packed like rats onto strangely small dance floors.  We tried to maneuver our way onto the floor in the only area playing hip hop, and we couldn't even get our elbows in.  Elsewhere, the music was bad and weird, with lots of irritating house and techno.

The best parts of the club were the outdoor areas, and Marquee gets that extra star because I liked the pool and the surrounding tables.  Of course, after a certain hour, you need to sign over your firstborn before you get to use a table, but I suppose if you're not too attached to your DNA the space is nice.  The outdoor areas are also fairly breathable, and some of the views are wonderful.  It was a cold night when I went, so I suppose I didn't get to enjoy these things thoroughly.  I also didn't really mind a random balcony we found, where we were able to take off our shoes and observe the dance floor.  But it wasn't glamorous, and it wasn't really part of the designated club experience.  

Probably also not a part of that experience?  Those ridiculous bleacher stairs.  Marquee is huge, like several stories high, and the night we went, the elevators were down.  From what I understand, even when they're operable, it's sometimes better to take the stairs.  To which I respond - what?  Then why does the stairwell look like the kind of shady back-of-the-building place where a girl in high heels might be murdered?  And more relevant to most - why am I expected to take these stairs in five inch heels, so that I almost eat shit by skidding off a step in front of the people in Marquee, who number in the thousands?

Anyway, if you must check out the hottest new club in Vegas blah blah blah, go for it.  If you're a girl, you're still best off if you know someone, and if that someone likes you, you can get in free.  If you're a boy, that same someone will still charge you $45.  We had no hassle getting in, which makes it even more amazing that I didn't have the time of my life.  (I also spent $0 inside, having pre-gamed in the hotel room and at dinner.)  We went early, and if you are inclined to check this place out, do show up as soon as you can.  Get a stamp and go to dinner if you have to - they won't guarantee your reentry, but it worked fine for us.

While I won't be surprised if I find myself back here, I can say with confidence that it will not be my choice.  Marquee's infestation of people and parking lot stairs really turned me off, and I will have to be plied with vodka before I'm willing to return.  I suppose in Vegas, though, that can easily be arranged.",7,12,6

Luckily, my group had hookups and we were able enter the club anytime.  HOWEVER, I did get dinner at China Poblano around 8pm (separate review - 2 stars) which is in front of the Marquee entrance and wow...the line was LONG!!!  Wrapped way down the hallway and for it being only 8pm, I was surprised.  Granted, it was opening weekend, but still.  I can imagine that anyone who writes a review based on waiting in that line will give the club 1 star or something.  The line looked awful, and Marquee has a strict dress code, so NO SNEAKERS GUYS!  I bet a lot of guys were turned away after waiting in that long line because they were wearing sneakers.  

Anyway, my crew rolled up around midnight and were walked right in.  Ladies were $20 and guys were $50 (this could have been an opening night price list especially with kaskade performing).  The layout is very windy and spread out kind of like a maze.  I remember getting lost multiple times just because it's not spread out flat like XS is.  The dance floor is in the middle surrounded by tables that are kind of elevated up similar to a cirque del soleil layout.  There is a large outside area that was surprisingly open for it being so cold last night (35 degrees).  There is also an upstairs that is more of a loungy area that is called the library (from what I remember at least).  A good part about the club being so spread out and maze-like is that there are a lot of different areas for people to hang and drink.  I think that once the initial buzz gets worn out, it'll be easier to get in for the general public.  I'm excited that kaskade will be spinning there regularly though!  I'll definitely be going back when he's there.",7,1,3

I've been here a number of times within the past 6 months. Each time has been pretty different from the last, but I'll share my thoughts and personal experiences about this new scene. I'm warning you now... if you have a weak stomach, you might want to stop reading this now. It's not pretty... but hey, you know the saying, what happens in Vegas... 

I first laid eyes on Marquee last August for one of my girl friend's bachelorette party. We wanted to come here on Saturday night because we knew this would be a cool spot for the night. I spent most of the day sippin' on drinks and sunbathing at the Hard Rock Pool. I had so much fun in the sun, but I may have had too many Blue Lagoons. And don't we all know how well sunshine and alcohol mix... not well!

So after that, we went back to the room to get ready. We skipped dinner, downed some drinks, and headed out the door to Marquee. It was most of our first times at Marquee and it was kinda difficult to figure out where the line for the club was. Apparently there's a million different entrances, but on this night we went to the very top floor and went in near the pool. The line was long and I was already feeling pretty nauseous. Great, the day's festivities have finally caught up to me. We must've been waiting in line for at least 30 minutes and we were finally close to the front. At this very moment, I knew I needed to find a bathroom or else I'd be caught in the act of a very distasteful scene. I also knew if that happened, it would be the end of our night. It took all of my energy to keep composed in front of the bouncers so he'd let us into the club. Right after I got in, I was scrambling to find a restroom. Holy crap, how many flights of stairs does this place have?? When I finally found a restroom... well, what do you know? There's a freakin' line, of course! I really should've pushed every girl out of the way and into a stall, but I didn't want to be ""that girl."" Long story short, I waited and handled my business when it was my turn. So did my friend and from what my other friends told me, we were handling it simultaneously. Maybe next time we'll try to synchronize it, haha jk!

Alright, so I like this club because it's pretty big. The pool area is cool too if you just want to chill outside. I've been to the day club too and I had a good time, but it was a little drizzly when I went so it wasn't very poppin'. What i don't like are those endless flights of stairs! This is definitely not a girl friendly place. It also gets so ridiculously crowded to the point where you can feel the sweat on the person next to you. It also sucks that you feel like cattle when you're trying to move from one area to the other. I bet if this place had a fire, we would all die. Dead serious about that one. The hip-hop room is pretty small... or is it just crowded? Not sure, but you can't even move through that crowd at all. Another thing I don't like is the lack of diversity here. Yes, I'm Asian, but I don't understand why we all must flock to the cool new place and take it over. I'm all for diverse clubs which is probably another reason I don't like Marquee so much. I guess I'll just have to wait to enjoy Marquee when the next new ""cool"" club opens.",3,5,3

The best I've seen in my entire life. You really have to experience this at least once in a lifetime. My first visit was in September of 2013. I liked it so much that I went there again when I was in Vegas in April of 2014.

Cons: It's difficult to find out what kind of music they are going to play. I really enjoy Electro, House, Techno, Trance and Dubstep, but I'm not into Hip Hop or Rap at all. If they have so many different rooms, I think they should be playing House only in at least one of those rooms or list music genres on their website. 

They played Hip Hop almost all the time in all the rooms. That's why I left at 2:00am instead of 5:00am. Can't wait until real club dance music becomes popular again...",0,0,0

The guestlist line looked pretty long but we were in the club by 20 min. Fiance had to pay $50 cover, mine was comped. For the first 20 minutes it was great--not too crowded, and the 1st DJ of the night was much, much better than the one we had at XS the night before.

And then more people came in. It soon turned into the mosh pit that was XS the night before. Some guy came up to the couple dancing next to us groped the girl in front of her bf! The guy instantly shoved him backwards and the creeper bolted. At this point we got sick of the shoving and getting stepped on (girl in front of me kept rubbing her pit sweat on my arm, which I would then rub back on her dress--GROSS) and took a walk outside (there was this open pavilion area? I'm not sure what the actual name is). Outside we found a sea of Asian dudes. Almost no girls. Just a sea of Asian dudes. I was really confused.

Overall Marquee was slightly better than XS, mostly due to the first 20 minutes where it wasn't disgustingly crowded. Also I found $20 on the floor, so that made it marginally better. Still, unless you get a table with a group, idk how you can have fun in this place.",1,6,0

From the enormous crowds clamoring to get the attention of the bouncers, I can tell I did not have the average experience. But I had a good time.

It's in The Cosmopolitan, which is a strikingly beautiful hotel. Glitz and glam, young and modern. Once we finally got our hookups straightened out (I guess everyone says they know someone - my friend had to show the guy his text from his friend to prove it) we went up the elevator with our three bouncer escorts. 

We spent very little time in the inside area of the club, because the dance floor was so crowded, they were not allowing anyone else on the floor. The club is gorgeous, and the DJ (Kaskade) sounded great. There is a large outdoor patio and pool area, where the music is still blaring and people are dancing. The crowd was young and disproportionately Asian (cool by me). People tripping on some drug or another were staring at their friend's multicolor light-up gloves waving around in front of their faces. Some dude ""made it rain"" over his friends and sent $1 bills everywhere into the pool. 

I have no idea what the bottle service costs, but it may be worthwhile. As with many comparable clubs, there is very little open seating.",2,2,2

Located in the absolutely beautiful and stunning The Cosmopolitan, it made me wonder why Marquee wasn't as breathtaking as the hotel was.  Prior to Marquee's opening, I saw news articles stating $60 million was spent on the club, $4 million of that spent on the DJ booth alone.  

Once I got back, I did something I never do: researched to find out who was responsible for the horrible design of the club.  David Rockwell of the Rockwell Group in NY designed the club as well as lobbies, the beautiful Chandelier bar, and guest rooms of The Cosmopolitan...obviously he wasn't consistent in designs.  Marquee was created and is operated by TAO Group.  If you've ever been to TAO, you've experienced the tons of stairs involved to maneuver throughout the club.  The stairs and design of Marquee is absolutely horrible and it's obvious that there wasn't any female involvement in the design because no female in her right mind to walk everywhere in 5 inch heels.

COVER:
$20 girls\/$30-50 guys (up to the manager's discretion)
Security were RUDE and SHADY with us.  We had 5 girls and 2 guys.  The girls were on the guestlist, however one security guard told us that there was no way that the guys would get in themselves without 2 girls with them.  My friend and I happily stood in line with the guys to be surprised by a RUDE security guy that since we were standing in that line, my friend and I would have to pay cover.  We explained that we were standing there so our guy friends could get in but he wasn't trying to hear any of it and rudely cut us off  and said we had to pay since we were standing in that line. 

LINE:
Since it's a new club, we knew it would be crowded.  We arrived at 9:45pm.  There was probably about 40 or so people in the guy\/girl guestlist line and the general admission line was completely empty.

ROOMS:
*Library Room - Consisted of a pool table and a bar, more of a lounge area
*Main Room - Pop and House, lots of tables for bottle service however 80% or so was empty when we were there
*BoomBox - Hip-Hop and Top 40s (1 star, you don't have to worry about your favorite Hip-Hop songs mixed in with House)

BAR:
$16-17 per shot for Cognac
(1 star because they have Hennessy Black!)

EXIT:
Good luck trying to leave the club.  Seriously.  There are several sets of stairs, each one leading somewhere differently and rarely you ever find one that actually let's you out of the club.  My friend and I had to ask how to leave because the place was like a maze and we were led out a door.  Walking through that crappy exit made it seem like I was in the emergency exit of an industrial building, no reflection on the hotel at all.  What's worse is that we ended up on the opposite end of the exit that our friends went through.

Do yourself a favor, go to XS.  Only because of a hip-hop only room and Hennessy Black, Marquee gets TWO stars for me.  Would I come back?  Maybe one more time and that's it, but because I want to see the pool.",4,0,1

Long story short I had a group of girls\/cousins come into Las Vegas for a bachelorette party. They needed a club to go to on Monday night - Marquee is open on Monday night - 1 star!

On Yelp I asked for some help to find a promoter\/host for a club on a Monday night and I was referred to Gia Lee at Marquee - found her on Facebook and got all 17 girls into the club, VIP line, with open bar from 10 pm to 11 pm - 1 more star!

Although I am NOT a club-goer (I used to be) I do LOVE The Cosmopolitan, and since I have high expectations for places in the Cosmo, Marquee was no exception. And Marquee delivered. I loved the look and layout of the club, plenty of accessible bars, an outside and indoor dancing area. The pool part of the club was especially my favorite. 1 more star!

My complaint #1 is the same complaint for ALL Las Vegas clubs; even with being guest listed my group STILL had to wait in a line. It's just annoying. I wish they would stream-line the process. If I'm going through a promoter, why can't she just walk me in? Why do I have to deal with the club-thugs (as I like to call them)? *sigh* I guess it's all part of the ""experience"".

Complaint #2 and this is a big one. When I went to leave the club I left by myself. I went directly to the elevators that I had come up in. The club-thugs at the elevators pointed me to a flight of stairs. WHAT. THE. F*CK. Yes, the profanity is definitely needed. ARE YOU KIDDING ME, MARQUEE? How dare your club-thugs make me use a flight of stairs in high-heels and drunk. Even at The Palms they let you take the elevator back down (yes, it is many more stories), but STILL. That needs to stop immediately. If it weren't for that ending I probably would have given 4-stars.",2,2,1

Needless to say this place is expensive.  They made this place for people with tons and tons of cash: russian and middle eastern jet set types.  With that in mind; clowns like us had to split up the bill.  This made it mildly affordable.  As for the club itself, absolutely beautiful, great music on the night in question and the girls were pretty unbelievable.   

As for what I noticed, entry is quick for tables, but there is still a line , if you are ga idk how you get into this place.  Cool elevator entrance and exit, host was ok, good ratio and people seemed to be having a good time.  The vibe is very euro-centric in the main area, that is to say its clearly catering to the ibiza-type crowd, house djs, good energy.  We did not go up to the dayclub\/nightclub area, though I think the move is getting a table at the dayclub and just staying, getting more and more bottles throughout the night; this can be cheaper than just showing up late night and getting a table on the dance floor.  The trade off is that way you aren't in the center of the action.  Given a significantly larger bankroll (15-20k) we could have blown this place up huge but that was not to be I suppose.  

Marquee marks a shift in the type of customer Vegas is starting to cater to.  Long a place for American tourists, this place looks like Ibiza nightlife which as an awesome thing.  The downside of that is that prices are quickly shooting up to come in line with that same kind of crowd so if you aren't prepared to part with a lot of your hard earned cash, skip this place.

If I had to put it in short, this club is like a mixture of TAO and XS, but with the crowd of what XS used to be when it first opened, which will probably mean that in a couple months, Marquee will be just like XS, a little overrated and super exclusive

But getting in is pretty simple.  You can talk to promoters to get the ladies in, but getting the guys in for free with them will be tough.  Guys will pay on average 30-50 depending on the night.

So when you get there, you take an elevator up to the club, and you enter onto the main dancefloor.  The setup is really nice, you walk around and it's very nice, elegant, and decorated with lots of colorful lights, but not too many as the club still remains pretty dark, like a club haha.  The dancefloor out there is a decent size, not impressively large, but not too small.  They generally play house music on this floor and this where guest DJs will generally be.  There are a couple of bars located around the dancefloor and tables that surround the dancefloor.  There's even an outside area with a pool area, very similar to the one at XS but with a different layout.
There's also a staircase, much like TAO, but it leads up AND down.  If you go up, you will find a lounge, which they call the Library, because it is set liek a Library\/Study Lounge, just like those you see in rich mansions.  They setting is much more ambient, which some music in the background and places for people to sit and a bar.  It's a nice place if you want to get just get away from the crowd but still want an intimate setting.
If you go downstairs, they call this the Speakerbox.  It is just another dancefloor with lots of tables around and here the DJ plays hip hop music.  It can get pretty crowded as it gets later into the night, but from my experience the DJ on both dancefloors play some pretty sick music.

The bar, I've only had one drink and she messed up my drink.  But it's only one time, so I'm willing to give it another go so I can't say too much about that just yet.  Drinks do run at about $15 a drink though, like any other club in Vegas so don't be surprised by it.

So overall, i'd give this place a 4.5-5.  I still need another time here because I can definitively say that this is a good club.  But like I said before, a mixture of TAO and XS.

the one thing that still amazes me about here is that belvedere is their well vodka.  that still blows my mind, and then they ask if it is ok they are using it.  are you kidding, i thought you guys were going to use smirnoff or popov or something",1,1,2

Getting a table, line pass, being on the guest list or being the first dozen in line is the only way in my opinion to ensure a good clubbing experience in Vegas unless you don't mind getting in in the am hours. 

I didn't expect our table to be outdoors but was pleasantly surprised on how nice it was to be outdoors.  Thank goodness for monsoon season which lowered the temps to a comfortable setting and the fans also helped keep things cool.  Our drink server was also very nice and attentive.   

The music was AMAZING! We walked inside to get a closer look and the beats were definitely getting us all to move around a bit because I will say that is the downfall as it is overly crowded! Seriously kept thinking I was going to get elbowed or poked in the eye.

All I remember was the upper level with the rooftop pool\/lounge which sucks if you don't have VIP because there are NO seats anywhere. And the music started out good but by the end of our night, it got worse and we were tired and there was no where to sit!

We ended the night at the library floor I think and that was crowded as well.

THE WAIT: Okay, the first time my friends and I tried to go here (we were staying at The Cosmopolitan, by the way), apparently (and I say apparently because I had not arrived yet)  the bouncer kicked our group out of the line because one of our tipsy friends had been drinking in line. I guess that's a policy we didn't know about but whatever. The next night we came back again and didn't have this problem.

THE CLUB & DANCE FLOOR: I have to admit, I was impressed at how big Marquee is. However, all the stairs and passages made me really tired! It was more work out than dancing! Needless to say, because of Marquee's popularity, all the dance floors were packed and super hot. Ugh.

THE MUSIC: Meh. I was pretty disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I love my fair share of electronic and house music, but I like a variety. The DJs just kept playing the same bleep-bleep-wom-wom sans-lyrics stuff that all the songs just started to mesh together, you know? I was dying to hear SOMETHING different, even if it's overplayed radio music. We went to all the dancefloors in Marquee and it was all the same.

THE PEOPLE: Creepy and rude. I know I shouldn't generalize or anything, but this was how my experience at Marquee went down. There was a girl who grabbed me and tried to dance with my reluctant self and screamed ""NOOO!"" when her friends tried to drag her away. It's funny when I think back on it, but not so much when it was happening during that time. Then, when we were trying to leave one of the dance floors to go rest somewhere, this angry girl purposely splashed her entire drink on our ""group train."" I don't know what her problem was because all we were trying to do was get out. Because my friend and I were the first two in our train, my friend's shirt got soaked and my hair was wet with nasty alcohol.

We ended up leaving at around 1 or 2AM because all of us just weren't feeling the vibe. I don't know if I would ever return to Marquee unless a celebrity DJ that I like is performing there.",3,2,0

I went here with my company as VIP guests, so we were treated quite fantastically from the moment we arrived. A welcome cocktail, ushered to our private section with open bar service, and friendly wait staff bringing us delicious libations. It was great. Once we were good and socially lubricated with our drinks, it was time for the live DJ to begin his set. We were taken to our VIP section to the right side of the DJ booth, where we were delighted with bottle service. The music was fantastic, the service amazing, and the drinks were non-stop all night. It reminded me of my club days in my 20's. 

Once we were ready to leave, we made our way back to the elevator area and waited to go back down to the exit. Eventually, an elevator arrived and we were told that we could not exit that way, that we had to take the stairs. Joy. Let's send a bunch of drunk people down stairs; that should be fun. And fun it was. The lady in front of me was clearly not suited for stairs, but still forced to take them. She had to slip off her high heels, and still stumbled down the first two flights. Upon reaching the next landing, we were met by an employee who told the lady that had just fell into her that she could not walk down the stairs without shoes on. The inebriated girl said to her that she couldn't walk with shoes and continued on, and the employee yelled at her that she had slippers. When the intoxicated lady was unresponsive to the employee's demands, the employee decided to yell, ""F*** you then"", to which I didn't take too kindly. In return, I spouted, ""Well, F*** you for not letting the drunk people use the elevator!"" and continued down the stairs. It seems I started an outcry of agreement to my statement and the employee just shut up and sank away. I guess Marquee didn't want anyone seeing the drunk people leaving the club, and they didn't care how they made it out - which I think was pretty crappy.",7,9,6

Well, from my previous Yelp review, I got a message from their guest relations apologizing for my unpleasant visit. Had wrote to me saying that me + 1 would get a comped admission + 1 complimentary drink each. Wow! :] 

I gave them a call on Saturday night, explained the message to them, and was told I would get a call back. 2 hours later, I get a call from one of the security guards at Marquee and said that everything was arranged. 

Arrived at Marquee at around 12:45 ish..and with nooo problem whatsoever, we got to cut the line, got our free admission, and the security guard who's name is Joe handed my bf and I 4 complimentary drink tickets. Now that is great customer service. Definitely more than what we expected. 

A much better experience this time. For both of the bars we went to (hip hop room and main room), they didn't have any milk to make my bf's White Russian. :\/ 

They seriously need to make the hip hop room bigger! Why so small for?! Good music though, loved it. Love the balcony outside as well. Has a great view. 

One thing I don't like about Marquee though, is too many stairs to walk up and down to to get to the other rooms. 

Main room dance floor is ridiculous. People, do not dance with your elbows up. You're going to hit someone, and cause a freakin' fight. Which was reallly close to happening. 
Felt like anchovies in a can. Pushed a couple of elbow dancers. 

Main room bar..idk about that bartender. He made me the worst Midori Sour I've ever had. I feel like he put pineapple juice in it?????!?!?!?!?! It was undrinkable..but I drank it. :\/ 

Other than that..thank you to both Jennifer and Joe for that night. Everything was great!",15,5,9

We bought tickets in advance to see Sander van Doorn and thank god we did! The line to get in was easy, breezy. Just go upstairs if you have tickets, instead of braving the hordes of people waiting downstairs.

Drinks here are Vegas priced, which translates to hella expensive! I think a round of shots for 4 was $55? And, it was so disgusting. I ended up pouring my vodka shot into some juice. Call me a puss, but I'm too old to down nasty shots. Now, if it's a good tasting shot, sure, bring it on!

It was a pain in the ass getting from the outside to the inside of the club. We had to stand in line just to get back in, instead of just going back in through the open patio. 

It's prettier outside, but the music doesn't sound as good. Be careful of the pools, you don't want to fall in. The music was kinda eh till around 1 am when Sander came on. Then, it got ten times better! We ended up dancing inside, since we wanted to be part of the energy, but it was super annoying getting told to move by security every 5 seconds. Geez! 

We ended up dancing over by the back patio. Whateves. I danced so hard that I broke my heels! And, my feet hurt for 2 days after.

If you are in Vegas to satisfy some checklist of stuff that you saw on the travel channel or celebrity gossip, then your purpose is obviously different, so proceed...but ye be warned.  Personally, I went in with no expectations but still came out utterly disappointed. 

Pros:
Packed with people
Excellent bottle\/table service
Multiple dance floors with different music genres
Great view of the Strip

Cons:
Packed with people
Rude bouncers, door people\/security, and management
Very long lines for everything

I went to The Marquee Club without knowing a thing about it.  We had VIP table reservations, so I figured everything was going to run smoothly, until we got to the Club.  There were nearly 500-600 people waiting in one line and another 300 waiting in another - I thought it was because we were early and the doors weren't open, but it was actually because the Club was already full.  The longer line was for people without table reservations: they let you in when space opens up (slim chance) as ""standing room only"" for a hundred dollars cover.  The shorter line was for people with table reservations: they have limited number of tables so you have to wait until one opens up, but at least you're guaranteed to get in. 

The club was packed with people - sardine can tight.  It was impossible to find a place to dance on the dance floors, let alone walk through them, and a lot of people ended up dancing in walkways, near the fences, and other odd areas where they could find enough space to move around.  Some people danced near a chain link fence without even getting a sniff of the dance floors.  By the way, there is no place to sit if you don't get a table, and drinks are expensive.  Only when I'm on vacation will I think that spending four thousand dollars on a bunch of bottles is justified - just to have the convenience of couches and an area to dance.

The best part about the Club was the young lady responsible for taking care of our table.  She poured our drinks, got new chasers for us, flirted with the guys, took a picture with me, was completely pleasant, and looked like a model.  She more than earned her thousand dollar tip because her customer service skills were off the chart.  

The worst part about the Club, aside from it being completely packed, was the attitude and actions of the door people, bouncers\/security, and management.  Considering the amount of money people pay and the expectations they have, you cannot hire thugs with no regard for customer service.  These guys wear suits, but they are little more than bullies on the Club's payroll.  In all my experiences, I have never dealt with a staff that was so rude and blatantly disrespectful to paying customers.  The bartenders are too busy running around getting drinks to even offer a smile... a shame considering the cost of a drink.

I'll list some of my random observations.  There were about 2-3 times as many guys as women.  Most of the people drank before entering the club to save money and hardly any of the guys were trying to buy drinks for the ladies.  Ladies who came in a group, danced in their own group.  There were a lot of guys just dancing by themselves or sneaking up on unsuspecting ladies.  There was nothing ""upscale"" about the clientele or the club, but you do have a very nice view of the Strip.  The really attractive ladies ignored everyone and sort of walked through the place trying to be seen.  I stuffed bills into a girl's thong after she flashed me and gave me a little dance.  Women relieved themselves in odd corners because of the lines to the restroom.  There are more posers than actual ""ballers"" but most of the ladies can't tell the difference.

There was an incident on our exit.  One of the bouncers grabbed a guy in our group and called management on him.  They said that he had to be detained because he was too drunk.  We tried to tell him that we were on our way out, but he refused to listen to us.  Without telling us a thing, they grab him and take him to a backroom.  When the women in our group started asking questions about our friend, their guys actually threatened us and challenged us to fights.  So that you understand, our group was composed of managers on a little team building vacation, not young thugs.  After 10-15 minutes, they report that our friend was too drunk and that we were all being kicked out of the Club.  

You're only in Vegas for a handful of days, so go to a club where you won't waste your time in lines or have to deal with a less than professional staff.  You will find the same crowd and overpriced drinks at the other upscale clubs but with less fuss and hassle.  If you're ideal club experience involves a sea of posers and the pretentious, then go right ahead.  It really isn't my ideal club environment\/vibe, but I have to admit, you will see some crazy stuff at The Marquee Club.",12,1,1

Let me start off by saying Marquee has potentially the BEST staff of any club in Vegas, and nothing in this review is any reflection on any of them that I've ever interacted with. The bouncers seem to be the only ones in Vegas that are actively friendly. Now, I rarely have issues with bouncers because I make sure I'm polite and can handle myself (i.e. not falling down drunk or screaming like a moron), but the bouncer directing you make an effort to joke around with you and get you excited and ready for the shenanigans. It makes a big difference in setting the vibe for the night and not making you feel like you can't laugh\/joke\/mess around with your friends in line. They are still good about removing people that are problems, which I appreciate.

Marquee also does tons of promotional deals. On my most recent trip this past Saturday for Cash Cash, a relatively big DJ, it was free for guys\/girls even ratio, and open bar for girls from 1030-1130 for those guest-listed. My girlfriend and I had 3 drinks each, and they were surprisingly well-made. (Shameless plug from a former waitress: make sure you still brings $1s to tip your bartenders at an open bar. It's just the classy thing to do, and they'll often remember you and make your 2nd\/3rd\/4th drinks stronger). Marquee is one of the few venues I've never had trouble getting guys in for free with even or better girl\/guy ratio, even for bigger names, and it definitely makes it a more attractive venue. When I was in graduate school, it was our go-to because of the price point. I also have to shout-out Jenn Tang for being the f*cking best promoter I've ever had in my Vegas life - she's never steered me wrong once and is always reliable.

Okay, now for the problems. One, the layout is just weird. I'm far from an architect and not sure what the logic was behind it, but the ""main"" dance floor is too damn small. On this past Saturday, it was even smaller than it was in June when I came for Galantis, with an extended stage area (presumably for the ""money bunny"" dancers to strut around on, who admittedly were very sexy and entertaining). It's absolutely ridiculous how little room there is to move, and you can FORGET about being able to dance after about 1045. Being at a table on the dance floor is precarious, as the crowd ends up pushing in and even falling over the rope once during my visits here. The bouncers do their best and are very apologetic, but I still feel like I always have to be on my guard so I don't become a collateral domino (especially in my stilettos). There is an L-shaped area (no view of the stage) with some additional tables and a bar that is nice to get a drink at (long bar), but last Saturday they only had 2 bartenders working. Even with both of them clearly busting their a$$e$, it was very slow. However, a noteworthy plus of Marquee: they will give you free tap water!! Hallelujah, no $12 bottles of tiny Fiji waters like seemingly everywhere else on the strip. I still think this should be mandatory at all bars\/clubs for safety reasons, but I digress. THANK YOU Marquee, for allowing me to moderately diminish the inevitable Vegas hangover.

In addition to the above, the crowd kind of sucks here. Again, I know this isn't necessarily something that the club can directly control. Likely because of the perks listed above (free water, great DJs, great promotional deals, free entry with guestlist, etc) the crowd is generally younger and, oftentimes, much more annoying. There seem to be people everywhere swaying and unable to handle their alcohol that well; I also get shoved more here. This also might have something to do with the nights I come on, but still something I've noticed on multiple occasions.

The downstairs Hip-Hop room (the BoomBox) is much better laid out; unfortunately, the music oftentimes sounds like someone plugged their iPod into a stereo at a house-party. The songs in general are good and the crowd is fun, but there is little to no transitions and it feels a little halted. I love coming down here when I get sick of the pounding EDM beats.

I've seen many of the big DJs that spin here (Dash Berlin, Galantis, and Cash Cash most recently) and even when they are absolutely KILLING IT the layout makes it really hard to enjoy. I usually end up either schmoozing at a table or in the back by the bar near the dayclub entrance where you can see the DJ, the visuals, and the dancers up on their little posts and still be able to move.

I guarantee I will be back here because my promoter Jenn is amazing, the music is always fantastic, and their deals\/free water are hard to beat for Vegas on a budget; however, it's definitely not my favorite. Come prepared to be a little patient and with a fantastic attitude on a night with a headliner you're excited about to offset the issues you might have.",4,0,2

Was having an ok time, nothing special, until things went crazy over a flask a friend had.  We filed a police report over what security did. They wanted my friend to leave and he agreed, and we decided to leave with him. Security wouldn't let anyone go with them while they took him in the elevator.  It was one unimposing guy surrounded by 4 giant security guards, they pushed him against the elevator wall and made his nose bleed then they choked him until he was unconscious.  They then tried to convince him they found him that way.  My friend pretended to agree with them because he was scared for his safety, but he was not drunk and remembered everything. They had their first aid person clean him up and only let him leave after he pretended to go with their story.  We filed a police report and are looking into legal action.  If security ever takes your friend here, get their names and take their photos. Do not trust them. Do not write this off as drunk belligerence. None of us were drunk, he did not resist them.

As usual in a club the music was loud and pumping but you can escape that by enjoying the outdoor space.

Sure, it came with a price to sit at a table.  It was expected in Vegas.  I mean, that's what makes this hell hole of a town thrive.  Money talks.  So, who gives a crap about statements like ""giving you my word"" and ""fair business practices"".  

""Whoah whoa!""  you say.  ""What's with all the hostility? It's Vegas!  Don't be angry!""  

 I can't stand how utterly third world Marquee's front staff really is. 

So here is what occurred.  A member of the bachelor party had spoken with one of the employees of this fine establishment to discuss the amount needed to obtain a table.  We were quoted 4000 for a ""tier 2"" table.  The members of the bachelor party, (mind you, some did not have the income to splurge) had made a consensus to get the table.  

When we showed up in the line for a table, the classic ""bait and switch"" technique occurred.  We were not honored such a deal, and for 3000 we were to get a tier 3 table as someone else had supposedly taken our previously negotiated table for a larger sum of cash.  

You know, we were honestly ""slighted"".  ""slighted"" to the worst degree.  And by ""slighted"" I really mean the f bomb.  But, we didn't want to dampen the spirits of the group.  They were excited to go to a club to have some fun.  After a few grovels here and there, we just decided to take a look at the said tables.  They had the nerve to make us pay 500 more for a table that was just next to the table he showed.  

The club itself was packed.  It was fun, but mainly because we were a cohesive group of buddies.   You know what, Marquee managers?  I would never stoop to your level.  If you came to me with a medical illness, I'd treat you like anyone else.  With respect and courtesy.  If you became my patient, I would look past this event and make sure that you were healed and happy.  It's just that no matter what I say will matter one iota in the big scheme that you have over there.  I just hope that this will warn people not to trust you guys.",13,8,5

The Will-call line was poorly managed. People kept appearing in front of me after I'd been waiting in line for over half an hour. Not cool! Get some barriers to stop people from pushing in.

To enter the club we had to walk up multiple flights of ugly metal stairs.. not a particularly great first impression to a Vegas super-club (!)

Once inside it was pretty crowded, but this was made better as the nightclub opened out onto the day-club. 

Drinks were expensive (as expected) but quite strong and tasted pretty good! 

In my opinion the dance floor itself is too small for the size of the club and promotes a huge crowd of people pushing to get to and from the dance floor. It also makes getting to the bathrooms really difficult.

Overall my friends and I had a really fun night and I would go back again!",6,1,3

DJ Chuckie was spinning, so you know it was crackin' already!

The Cosmopolitan Hotel is, hands down, my favorite hotel on the strip. It is ritzy, it is glamorous, it epitomizes Las Vegas hotel beauty. As you make your way to Marquee, you'll be mesmerized by Cosmo's chandelier bar; you need to stop there and grab a drink before going to Marquee. You won't want to waste 30 minutes ordering drinks once you get into the club, trust me.

Everything about Marquee is unreal, but amazing: the lights flashing everywhere, the music booming (all you hear is pounding bass!), the go-go dancers, and all of the secret passageways to the different dance rooms. The main dance floor spins House\/Club\/Trance, and if you don't want to squeeze your way in, you can forget about dancing in there - it gets packed. 

In the ""library"" they spin Rap & Hip-Hop; it's called the library because there are book shelves along the walls. [If you can find it], we also went up to this semi-catwalk area where we had a view of the entire main dance floor! 

We ended up dancing out on the rooftop terrace because our friends had a table, it was cool because there was a DJ spinning outside too! We had a beautiful view of the Vegas lights' skyline and saw some girls swimming in the pool, like completely swimming in the pool in their dresses. I guess they forgot they were at a damn club? You are literally enveloped by the music, and it's no wonder, the entire sound system cost $2 Million! Now isn't that worth a listen?

If you are going to Vegas soon, you MUST go to Marquee, no questions, just GO.",2,0,4

The easiest way to sum up their pool party is to compare it to one of my other favorite venues, Wet Republic at MGM. That way you can get a feel for which you like better.

-------------------                             --------------------------
Summary: Rage Fest, Cluster         Summary: Spacious, Medium Chill
- wait 30+ min in line                       + hardly a wait to get in
- main pool that's a cluster              + multiple pool areas not as packed
- no shade by pool if not VIP           + shaded waterfall area
+ state of the art visual effects        - decent visuals
+ larger: 54,000 sq ft                       - smaller: 22,000 sq ft
- everyone and their mom is here    + slightly more spacious
- poolside cabanas easily invaded   + some cabanas have mini pool
+ Steve Aoki, Tiesto, Calvin Harris   + Porter Robinson, Audien, Tritonal

Wet Republic (WR) may be bigger, but as we all know, size isn't everything! So true. Although Marquee is less than half the size of WR, it isn't as jam-packed cluster-****ed either. It feels a lot more spacious with more breathing room. Sometimes you might want to be where everyone is, but other times you may want to take things down a notch. The pool areas at Marquee are not as much of a cluster as at WR and I love the shaded ankle-high pool \/ waterfall area here. You can comfortably stand with a drink in hand and not worry about getting soapy splashes in your drink.

Yes, WR has a newly remodeled DJ area with state of the art visuals and can pull the top charted more mainstream DJ's, but the DJ's at Marquee are just as talented and awesome to hang out with. 

I think my favorite feature at Marquee is the individual mini-pool that comes with certain cabanas. Great way to stay cool but also keep things a little more private. 

TIP: Get tickets in advance online or sign up for guest list through one of the promoters. Don't pay last minute prices for any clubs or pool parties! Plan in advance.

DATE TIP: If you want to ensure that you impress your date, get one of the cabanas with its own little pool. Nice and intimate! Or if you do not yet have a date, get one of these cabanas and I'm sure you soon will!",52,40,47

Marquee Nightclub is hyped as the current 'it' club in Vegas, and for the most part, if you're willing to get through some of the pretty annoying parts of it, it lives up to it's title.  

A couple nice things about the club include three different floors with different music playing on each, a pretty big outdoor patio area with a casino, and a relatively excited crowd there to celebrate.  The sets themselves are pretty extravagant too and dancing there with gogo dancers dressed in different garb, confetti, mist, and glowing tube sticks all add up to a pretty unique experience that I've never had until Marquee.  

A couple things to note - there is an elevator (two?) that will help take you up and down the floors.  However, with how packed the club usually is on weekends, it's best to take the stairs on the side to go up and down so do expect some climbing.  Speaking of the crowd, with an excited crowd comes popularity and with popularity comes overcrowded areas.  If you want to really dance, try to get to the dance floor as early as possible.  Bouncers start to block off people from entering the main dance areas when it's deemed 'overcrowded' and will randomly let people in at times when they feel it's right so be like a hawk and try to aim at the right moment.  

As always with these popular clubs, getting on the guestlist is a 'must' for a Saturday night along with getting to the club early (even getting there around 10:30PM will probably force you to wait for about an hour).  Don't expect to get in anytime soon if you arrive late and aren't on some list.  (I'd mention expensive drink prices but really, that shouldn't be much of a surprise.)  

So again, if you love some spectacle DJ sets, a choice in music floors, and a great crowd beside you and you're willing to put up with some annoying parts, Marquee is a great nightclub.",5,0,0

Last time I was there, you could barely walk through, and people were getting down and dirty in the walkways...it was extremely difficult to get around in there.

Very thankful that the club had different floors with different music to please everyone.  The rooftop had a pool (look out for the mermaids in the pool) surrounded by cabanas and electro music played.  More of a laid back atmosphere...didn't see anyone dancing...honestly, I saw many people who looked bored in their cabanas.  Went one floor down and it was crackin!

So after partying at XS Nightclub, my boyfriend and I decided to go to Marquee Dayclub the next following day. And yes...we only had 4 hours of sleep. We went from a nightclub to a dayclub right away. 

Originally, we didn't have plans to go to a dayclub. But since it was summer...why not? :) 

My boyfriend and I got there around 10AM thinking that we were going to be late. Turns out we were one of the early ones there. Hmmmm...people recovering from their hangovers, I believe? I SAY YES! XD

Water was really clean when there is only a few people. But be aware...as soon as it hits after 12PM noon time, you will see some slight changes in the pool. Yes...you know what I'm talking about. XP On top of that, Marquee Dayclub would toss out some inflatables and beach balls. Sometimes if you're lucky, you might find a rubber ducky nearby. Of course with the DJ spinning some awesome music, people will be splashing here and there. So don't complain about your hair being all wet. After all, this IS a dayclub. =P

Overall, I had a lot of fun!! There are lockers that they provide but rental for the whole time period is 20 dollars. Also, they serve some food at the dayclub.  

I would most definitely come back here. :)",1,0,1

Once we were through the doors we had to climb more stairs than I could ever count.  And not a nice fancy staircase, but an emergency exit white metal grate stairwell.  When we made it into the club we went straight to the first bar we saw.  We were served drinks fairly quickly at the first bar, but the second bar took us over 10 minutes to be served and we walked right up to the bar.  This club was dark, had zero character (there was so much ""fog"" that we couldn't even tell if the walls were painted, everything looked gray).  The dance floors were extremely crowded and we were pushed around more than anything.  I felt like I was back in my punk show days moshing in the pit - not fun in a dress and heels.

so my last review, I only reviewed the day club, but here's my night club review:

THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!! I LOVE MARQUEE!! 

This past weekend, I saw my love, Ryan Raddon, better known as KASKADE, and it was AMAZING\/WONDERFUL\/SPECTACULAR\/PURE HAPPINESS. Honestly, sooooo many people told us we wouldn't be able to get in without pre-sale tickets, but you know what? WE DID! SO THERE! Anyways....this place is always a good time. 

Venue: There are THREE floors: top floor - chill bar\/library (nice place to chill and have drinks), middle floor - house dancefloor + pool cabana area, this is where all the dj's play and where most of the tables are. They have multiple dancefloors on this one floor, the pit, the dancefloor near the bar, and one more outside where the dayclub is. It's pretty spacious but it gets really crowded, especially if someone is playing that night. so be warned: IF A DJ IS PLAYING, THEY WILL CLOSE THE PIT AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET IN, bottom floor: hip-hop room aka the Boom Boom Room, if you wanna get down to some hip-hop, this is your place. It's always a good time

Crowd: seriously, it's so diverse. This weekend, I saw people my age (early 20's), people in their late to early 30's, and even a couple of guys that my friends and I swore looked like they were in their 60's. I mean these guys were wearing bowling shirts and had white hair...not that I'm hating.... 

KASKADE: yah i know he's not always there, but I had to add this anyways. He came on at around 1 and played until like 4\/5. HE WAS AMAZING! HE KILLED IT and HIS SET WAS BOMBBBBB. Played all of my favorites and even snuck in the new SHM song into the set which seriously made me love him even more. Then, when the beat dropped, down came SNOW(basically soup bubbles), BUBBLES, & CONFETTI!!! it was crazzyyyyy!!! He seriously killed it saturday night. I'm just happy thinking about it. 

Anyways, I seriously love this club. I've always had a good time and I've seen sooooo many people\/ DJ's here, I couldn't hate this club if I tried. The only bad part is that it gets SOOOOO CROWDED and crowded = HOT HOT HOT & STUFFY STUFFY STUFFY! Luckily, when the DJ's go on and the beat drops, they blow this nice cold air on you...IT'S AMAZING.",2,0,2

My friends and I choose Marquee ( Dash Berlin was performing) over XS club on our last clubbing night in Vegas and it was the best decision ever! One of my friends contacted a promoter and we were put on a guest list (Yay- no cover!) and promised a free table with bottle service. However, when we were going through security, we were told that we did not have any table. Despite loosing our table, we had too much fun dancing the night away to really care. 

The dance floor is a bit cramped and tiny, but there were many special effects that made in worthwhile to stay on the dance floor even when you have sweaty bodies pushed against you. Throughout Dash Berlin's set, which was amazing by the way, there were bubbles and confetti and even gushes of cold air blasting at you. The gushes of cold air was a life saver and blessing since it was hot on the dance floor. Luckily, towards the end of the night, the dance floor became less crowded and it was easier to dance there.  

Besides the main dance floor where Dash Berlin was performing, you can also head outside where the music is all hop hop\/ R&B. Its a nice change of scenery if you needed a place to cool down or just wanted a break from EDM music.  Dash Berlin definitely kept the crowd entertained the whole night.  Even when my friends and I were chilling in the restroom, we were jamming to his set with random strangers. We were having a mini bathroom party in there thanks to Dash Berlin. Marquee is definitely on the top of my list for my next trip to Vegas!",1,1,0

We met two different guys who asked us to join them at their tables and we did and had the time of our lives!! Me and my girls were a good group in Vegas LOL. The music here is mainly techno while the Boom Boom is all hip hop so after we were tipsty we headed over here to dance the night away.

Security's kool,  good music, but the bottle service waitress try to bamboozle me. We had made previous arrangements to get bottle service at the club with a capacity of 15 party goers. So we show up right on schedule. Everything look good skipped the long line right onto the elevator where one of the promoters handed us over to a waitress. She then walked us to our VIP area that holds about 20 people located right next to the  dance floor. When we walk into the lounge area there was already a different party of 10 occupying half of the VIP area. There was two couches, two little ass tables one for each right next to each other. Our area hold 4 standing, the couch hold 6, and the rest of my guest were standing on the walkway outside the VIP lounge not inside. It was so crowded that our waitress couldn't walk through and she was Asian tinny and really skinny. But By then she already had my American Express. She ask what would we like, so I order a minimum of 3 bottles, but before she walked away I told her we didn't fit, and that some of my guest were standing on the hall way, if passable we would like our own space. So I know the bottle service would be price about 1,500 with about 400 to 500 in gratuity. So as my guest and I are discussing to move to a bigger place, I get a security alert on my phone by American Express that if I was authorizing a charge of $3,100.00 on my card to txt back to confirm it. I was disappointed with our waitress. So she comes back and tells me that my card didn't go through and I replayed, because u tried to charge me $3,100 bucks. So she walks away didn't say much, and a little Asian boy in a suit trying to look important comes up to me and asks me what was the problem, so I ask him how much for our bottle service, we ordered 3 bottles?  if you want to order 3 bottles he said $1,500, I reply,  so why is your waitress trying to charge me $3,100 bucks.. He looks down on his phone pretending he was txting someone.. The reason was shity, he said it was to add gratuity. Me; Huh $1,600 bucks more.. Oh the reason she charge you more was just in case you wanted more bottles he saids.. What you're crazy I have never heard of your lil scam. Then he said ok $1,500 and I'll move you to your own VIP ok kool. So as we are gathering my peepz he said we can't do it. So I said ok bye.. Walk right out and had a wonderful time at a real club. !PURE NIGHTCLUB AT CAESARS PALACE!.. Thanks to my security alert the little Asian due didn't bamboozle me!.. Please be extra alert when you attend this club and keep a visual alert on the little Asian guy that looks like Jackie Chen and his lil Asia accomplice waitress, ask how mush would it cast b4 they bring out the bottles and check your receipt at the end..

I'll admit, I'm really not a big fan of clubs anymore now that Im older & married, so my expectations were low. But Marquee really exceeded them!

My friend & I were in Vegas celebrating our birthdays & she really wanted to go to a club. I agreed, because I wanted to experience a Vegas club & all the hype. I signed up for the guest list via the Marquee site a month in advance. But when we got there, (a little early because we were having drinks at Chandelier first) a promoter put us on his guest list instead. It worked out way better because his guest list included free entry & an hour long open bar. The legit Marquee guest list may have included that as well, but Im not sure. 

We left Chandelier & walked over to Marquee at 1030, & there was already a long line for guest list entry. But, it moved so fast! Id say it took maybe 20 minutes from when we got in line to when we were inside the club. Props to Marquee for making that process so easy. 

So basically, the entry process (for guest list) goes like this: you show your guest list text\/email to the first bouncer for confirmation. Another bouncer makes his way down the line to check ID's and stamp your hand. My promoter also caught up with me & my friend to give us wristbands for the open bar. You move through the line & meet another bouncer who gives you a free entry pass. AT the door, you either pay the cover or hand in your free entry pass. Get another hand stamp. Then, another line forms to check bags & do a quick pat down. Another bouncer brings you upstairs in the elevator to the actual club. Sounds sorta confusing but it was a breeze to get in, trust me! 

The club itself was pretty cool. Awesome lights, effects & sound system. The bartenders were sweethearts & made strong drinks, even during the open bar. The bouncers & other staff were great as well. My friend tripped & fell & spilled her drink everywhere. Two bouncers came right over. One helped her up & the other had a towel handy to clean up the spill. Both of them checked on her to make sure she was okay. 

DJ was bomb too. Eric DLux was spinning that night & he was fire. Played a really good mix of EDM & pop hits. Confetti, misters that blast cool air on the crowd, smoke & fog, & big light up foam glow sticks were added extras that enhanced the performance. Shoutout to the go go dancers too...beautiful & entertaining to watch. 

The only thing that sorta sucked about Marquee is the stairs you have to take to exit the club. There must be like 6 or 7 flights, which usually isn't bad...but when you're drunk & wearing heels, it's tough! Ladies, be careful! 

Also, a tip for the gentlemen: at least 95% of the male clientele were wearing suits or button down, collared shirts & ties. Dress nice otherwise you'll be really out of place.",5,0,0

COVER:
Friend's promoter hooked my girls and I up (bachelorette party) with VIP tickets so we didn't have to pay for cover or wait in line. Otherwise I'm sure cover is the regular Vegas price of $30 and beyond...  But you know girls can get in free nowadays.   So if you can find a connection, do it because it's not worth paying cover to get in here.  Drinks are the usual $15 bucks and up for a small glass.  Cups if you're outside.

VENUE:
Like Miss Vanessa said, this place is like a maze getting from room to room.  There's tons of stairs.  Carpeted stairs inside and these metal stairs in the back you have to walk to get to the floors.  Um who designed this place?  Lawsuit and disaster waiting to happen,  I was just waiting for some wasted chick in her 20 inch stilettos to roll down the stairs and eat it.  Actually it would be like 10 girls since they were all holding each other walking down haha  I wish I took a picture!  Anyways, security let us use the elevators at the end of the night heading out....thank gawd.  I will admit the ambiance and decor is beautiful.

***Top Floor:  lounge area with pool tables.   Didn't get a chance to go up here.
***Middle Floor:  Ok sized dance floor and a patio that opens to a small pool with swimming mermaids.  A bunch of VIP areas but not a lot of ""free"" seats.  Got stuck here since the bottom floor was so packed.  A**hole security kept telling me and my girls to stop leaning on the VIP chairs when it's so obvious other people were.  Also told us if we blew up one more condom we'd be kicked out.  First none of us were blowing up the condoms on our necklaces, it was the random guys who were grabbing it from us.......this is where I pull out the racist card.  Music was house\/trance all night....dislike.
***Bottom floor:  Tiny room playing hip hop beats.  Wanted to stay here bc of the music but the place is so small you're jammed up against all these bodies and can't move anywhere.  Sweat and smells everywhere. This is where fellas get their free grabs.  Dislike. 
Pain in the butt finding the bathrooms and I wasn't even drunk yet.  Dislike.

ATTIRE:
Dressy of course!

With multiple levels of dance floors, you can choose where to make a fool of yourself and where the debauchery begins. 

Upon entering Marquee Nightclub, they take you up an elevator to the top floor where the main stage is. The outdoor patio is stunning and definitely makes you feel like you're in paradise. 

As opposed to the other floors, I only remember going to the music box which is mainly hip hop and feels like you are literally jammed in a box. Still fun, nonetheless. 

The crowd is usually pretty young (20's to early 30's). Marquee has also started becoming more and more crowded as of late. Not good when you have to have that many people crawl down those flights of stairs...

The drinks are always expensive as expected! Expect to pay $13-18+ tip per drink if you're getting thirsty.

For Marquee Dayclub, I've always had a great time as well. It's pretty much the same except everyone is in bathing suits and you have a clearer view of who is hitting on you. For girls, they sometimes have open bar specials (Sorry boys). Day drinking at its best.

It pays to be on the guest list at Marquee as we were not in line for very long. We were whisked away via a back entrance route to the club. Ladies, this entails a very brutal walk up the stairs as evidenced by my lady friends. The ladies with the large heels have to work for a wonderful clubbing experience. The club consisted of two sections. They were playing hip hop outside while playing EDM inside. The thing that was most noticeable were the translucent hot tubs adjacent to the cabanas. It seems like those tubs would be used during the day time. I was mainly outside listening to the hip hop music but the EDM music was also pretty good as well. Also, if I remember correctly, mixed drinks were about $16 a drink.....so definitely try to pre-drink before you come to the club.

Marquee provides you the ability to purchase your tickets in advance before going to the club. For the world renowned DJ's that they bring into the venue, it is advisable to do so. Also, Marquee has all access wristbands that are good for an entire weekend. One weekend I saw had the price point for an all weekend wristband was $100 for males and $30 for females. I suppose that if you were a guy who really wanted multiple opportunities to hookup with girls, the wristband may be worth it. Who knows......

The music definitely stole the show. I would love to return to Marquee in the near future.",5,1,2

This club is over-rated. It really is, if it wasn't for the big house\/trance head-liners who DJ's here. That is the only reason why I go to Marquee and will return to Marquee. 

One of the main problems that many clubbers face is not the $ issue its  the fact that Marquee has Long chaotic line! If you are not there early, have table reservations, or no connections, you will be waiting for a long time! Save yourself the worries of whether you will be getting in or not by buying the presale tickets online (ESP guys) or be there super early. If you want to stroll in to the club later or want to skip the long lines and free\/reduced admissions without getting table service, you will need to know and contact a host, and i'm not talking about some junior rookie host either because they do not have seniority and most will just give you discount passes (girls free\/guys $5~10 off)  like the rest of the folks on the streets of lv blvd...someone on the executive\/senior level would be nice... who can better accomodate you.

While taking the escalators to Marquee, there were tons of people walking out telling us how the line is so long, no one will get in, good luck getting in, etc etc. But that didn't stop us since we had a host. 
The bouncers weren't particulary assholes but i can see they can be. Our group had 8 girls and 2 guys. While the girls were busy taking pictures in front of that big ol red shoes (lol!) the bf was walking towards the club, and the bouncer said he won't be getting in because of his shoes! (vans.lol) I was thinking like Noooo! 

At this point, i'm thinking wth! his shoes aren't even that bad. It's black and not dirty... I told my bf, forget the stupid bouncer! I text my host and he tells me to meet him in front of the ropes. So off we skip all the people in line and we get into the club! This whole process took.....5 minutes. 

The sound system is NICE but it is VERY VERY LOUD! like wow! I could feel my self vibrating. LOL Drinks are good.Layout is meh.Hiphop room is SMALL. The dancefloor gets overcrowded to the max. Once the headlining DJ comes on and you go OUT of the dancefloor, you can not come back in...(supposedly, from my friends who tried to come back to the dancefloor after using the restroom or buying drinks) So stick together or just party outside the dancefloor.

Entry: As we came up the escalator, first thing we saw was Metro Cops everywhere (not casino security.  Then, there are multiple lines for different things, I'm not sure even the bouncers know what is what.  To round that off people were cutting in front of us across the ropes.  The bouncers checking the lists didn't even check ours, the girls we were with were amongst the hottest in line.  Once to the elevator they crammed us in like sardines.

Club: After an elevator ride up, we entered the club which is on the roof of the Cosmo with indoor and outdoor areas.  The main dance floor is too small, no room to dance, lacks high-quality lighting and sound (Drai's, Wynn, and Rain are better.

Drinks: We ordered the same drinks 3 times in a row and were quoted different prices each time, upon asking about this the third time, the bartender rudely said we got a receipt with each drink, we didn't...  ON top of that, the drinks are weak, not even worth buying.

Crowd:  The crowd was rude and careless, two people in my party had drinks dropped near them.  Another had her own drink dropped by someone right after getting it, of course the bartender after seeing this told us he wouldn't replace it.

Exiting:  We left early because the club sucked, we went to the elevators we entered through, we were rudely told we were not allowed to use these elevators and the exit was through the adjacent hallway.  So we went to the adjacent hallway and found out the exit was actually through the hotel's emergency exit stairwell.  The girls we were with both had high heels, so we had to carry them down the stairs for safety (approx. 4-5 flights)

I would give this place five stars if it wasn't for the funky layout. Right when you enter you have to walk up this flight of stairs that will make you tired if you aren't moderately fit. 

The cool thing is that there are several floors that play different music, and a pool room that is more of a lounge area to chill. More rooms means easier to find people as long as your have reception. When this place gets crowded though, get ready to fight through people since most of the floor space is not open grounds where you can just squeeze through people. 

Guys...be smart and buy your pre-sale. I know, I know...you're a cool guy with LOTS of girlfriends and you get in free to clubs ALL THE TIME...stop being an idiot and just buy a pre-sale.

The Main Room was packed as normal.  The girl I was with, we tried to get in but security already blocked off entrance but we caught a glance of Red Foo from LMFAO.

We went outside and there was a decent amount of people in the dayclub area and we got drinks there (Drinks are not cheap!  Be prepared!).  Overall had a lot of fun, but I'll be only going when it's free for locals so Marquee Mondays it is!",2,0,1

:\/ This review is for people who don't have a VIP table. If you get a table I think the experience would be 10 times better.

Did I miss something? I went on Marquee Monday. I don't know guys. I think this place might be a little too hyped up for their own good. 

Should have known it was a bad night when the bouncer was super disrespectful to the group of ladies I was with. Little chocolate man with your guest list roster around 11:40PM this past Monday, what is your deal?! Why are you so angry? Didn't your mother teach you how to be a gentleman?

When we joined a guestlist group in line at XS, they had no problem at all letting some extra ladies into the club. At Marquee I don't think they really care about girl to guy ratio.

A nice, but very drunk group of girls invited us to come with their group on guestlist. When the girl pointed us out to the bouncer, he let them through and acted like we weren't part of their group and they were so drunk they didn't even notice. When I told him Britney said it was okay for us to join, he looked up at me like I had just told him he was an idiot and said there wasn't a Britney in that group. When I pointed out the girl in the leather dress he said she wasn't the name on the guest list and instead of going up to her and asking her about us, he straight up accused me and condescendingly said, ""WHY ARE YOU LYING TO ME? WHY YOU LYING? You need to get out of this line NOW."" He pushed past me and went to the group behind us. A nice bouncer took pity on us and let us cut the general admission line and apologetically told us we would have to pay cover. We didn't look especially hoochie that night so we said sure why not. At least we don't have to wait in that line.

Big ups to the hot bouncer who noticed it was my birthday the day before and wished me happy birthday still, and for letting us in for free.

THAT'S RIGHT! LADIES WHY ARE YOU PAYING FOR THIS PLACE?!?!?!

I'm upset that I see so many cute girls on here saying they paid a $20 cover. Like what? If my average looking ass didn't have to pay cover, all the pretty girlies on here should definitely not have to! I think if I had paid cover, I would have been more pissed and this review would have had A LOT MORE CAPS!

I was like ""okay this place is well onto redeeming themselves for that shitty bouncer.""

So we enter in on the 2nd floor, take the elevator up to the top. Long story short

-music sucked in all three rooms! I'm not really a fan of house but if it's got a good beat I'll dance to it! Couldn't even give us that!

EVEN THE HIP HOP ROOM! How do you mess that up? WHY DO YOU CUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A SONG SO EVERYONE HAS TO PAUSE AND LOOK AT EACH OTHER LIKE WTF?

-they block off the dance floor and keep everyone moving. the bouncers have these stupid lights they keep moving and it's literally like herding cattle.

-no where to sit. if you find a place, the bouncers make you get up

-no where to dance! they block off the dance floor and don't let anyone in or out
soooo crowded! definitely a fire hazard

My friends left literally within 20 minutes. I left after an hour of trying to have a good time but it wasn't happening. And then....

THE STAIRS? LOL WUT
Thankfully I was smart and brought foldable flats and the bouncer let me pull off to the side to change into them. He said they don't allow girls to walk barefoot so a lot of ladies trying to take their shoes off had to put them back on.

There were a ton of people leaving at 1 AM. That is ridiculous. Who leaves a Vegas club at 1AM? It was that bad...everyone walking down was uttering their disappointment about Marquee. Also saw two girls eat it down those stairs. 

So funny once we all got out of the club, everyone went into that little lounge that is right next to the 2nd floor entrance to Marquee. That place was POPPIN! No cover, the hip hop music was on point, the majority of the crowd had just come from Marquee. I actually saw people leaving the Marquee line to go there. And who should I find there but my friends who left me at Marquee. lol

I don't want to be that annoying person that compares everything to XS cuz before I went to Marquee I was going to give XS 3 stars but literally at XS...

music is better (and it's hard to please me with house music)
they love the ladies and don't make them pay!

Go big or go home. This ain't California. This ain't hippy."" Touché, snatch, touché.

I would've been better off spending my time at the spa. 

You see, I'm not too fond of Vegas clubs; getting dressed in upscale attire, waiting in line to get in, paying crazy cover charge (not always) then making your way through a multi-leveled club that feels at overcapacity. Don't even get me going on getting a drink at the bar and paying a grossly amount on watered down ""liquor."" 

I'm a t-shirt and jeans kinda gal who'd prefer to just go down to the local bar\/pub and enjoy my time muss-free with a good beer in hand and maybe a round of pool. Since we were in town celebrating my BFF's 'Fine at 29' weekend we had no choice but to check the hottest club in Las Vegas at the moment. Suck it up. I guess I'll quit my bitching now.

As guests of the hotel we got free passes and was lucky enough to go through a very fast ""hotel guest's line."" Whew! After making our way through the back entrance and walking up several flights of stairs, bumping into one of the backstreet boys all the while singing, ""Cry me a River,"" we entered Marquee. First point of order, hit the bar-find friends later.

Wandering through the different ""music"" floors and checking out the open aired patio we spent most of our time in the hip hop room, 3rd floor if I remember correctly.  After discovering our friends dancing in the middle of the floor and having gotten a drink spilled on me squeezing my way through the gyrating crowd, we found it easier to chill outside along the breezeway where we can enjoy fresh air, conversation, smokes and drinks all while throwing our hands in the air like we just don't care.

We didn't get back to our room until dawn, normal for Vegas standards but tell that to my sleeping toddler who then got up at 730am ready to hit the pool. Not a fun day for this mother bear I'll tell you. You can bet that would be our very last time clubbing Vegas style.

Note: Bar kiosks found along the sides of the club floors offered beer. A plus for my beer drinking husband. Women's restrooms were surprisingly a breeze to get in and out of.",3,1,2

It was very crowded but who cares when you are totally into the music and jumping around as one being. What I did find annoying is drunk girls. Get off the freaking dance floor, it's not a yoga studio so stop sitting in the middle of the dance floor! And Guys - if a girl can't stand, stop dipping her! How many times can she end up laying on her back on the floor before you stop dipping her?!? After an hr, you should get a clue.

When I went it was ALL house. What's the point in making separate rooms and hiring separate DJs if they all play the same genre? The library room upstairs was the only place we found that played hip hop (and that chick was legit!), but its a lounge room, no dance floor... unfortunate. I've heard they've added a hip hop room though, just haven't found it.

We got there very early and had a decent ratio so I didn't experience any problems getting in, but I can only imagine this line sucks if you don't know someone or get there late. Typical prices: expensive cover, expensive drinks.

The pool area looks nice, makes me wonder what the dayclub is like. But the billion flights of stairs to exit the club wasn't the best design idea. I can't think of who would want to climb down that many stairs after a night of drinking and dancing (Maybe to keep the employees entertained watching sloppy drunks or girls in heels fall on the way out?)

They have an outdoor area as well so you can go out there to cool off and catch your breath from dancing.

Being on the guestlist is great because you skip the lines and for us ladies admission is free. Don't worry fellas, you guys get in at a discounted price.

There are multiple dance floors depending on what type of music you're feeling. Second floor for hip hop, third floor for house.

We had a cabana, which may skew my review towards the positive, as the service was excellent.  Our cabana attendant was awesome - very friendly and helpful.  In fact, he was a huge help in kicking out (with zero drama) a group of girls who latched onto us and who we did not want around.  The wait staff was also incredibly friendly and attentive.  Again, this is probably a function of the amount of money we spent.

While a few people in our group were apprehensive about the amount ($3000, not including 20% gratuity, 10% entertainment tax, and 8% sales tax), even the most apprehensive among us ended up really enjoying themselves in the end.  I saw one of my most conservative friends, who didn't start drinking until after college, in the pool at the end of the day fist pumping to EDM.  

The cabana itself (regular cabana, not a grand cabana, which can run around $10,000, but has a small infinity pool in front of it) was well-appointed, with nice decor, a couch, coffee table, fridge, plenty of space to store wallets, phones, etc (beware - they do not lock), TV (for watching all the college FB games we bet on), and two adjoining chairs in the sun.  It was also relatively spacious, providing enough room for 10 of us to hang out in and around.

Although the place turned into the typical debaucherous messy drunken scene you would expect from a Vegas pool party (and I am not complaining about that), when we walked in, we were blown away by how nice the place looked - very pristine and exclusive (that soon changed, but it was a nice first impression at 11am).

The food was surprisingly good (bar pies, burgers and fries).  We kept ordering pitchers of the iced tea vodka lemonade.  Delicious, but not sure how much booze was in them.  A good idea would be order a bottle, and add liberally to your pitcher.  Bottles are expensive ($500 for absolut), but what do you expect?

There were a lot of beautiful women here also.  Unfortunately, there were many more that could use a salad and a trip to the gym.  Basically, it was your typical Vegas pool party scene.  

All told, it was a lot of fun and, in my opinion, worth the money.  Mileage may vary if you do not have a cabana.",2,0,0

We decided to try this club after the recommendation of our waiter at STK on 1\/5\/15.  Although it was packed outside the club, we were able to get in without the wait in line.  

And here's where it goes downhill:
1.  We get in and my girlfriend and I head straight to the dance floor.  Its packed, great music playing and we get on the dance floor right away.  However, when our husbands attempt to follow us, they get blocked.  Yes, the male bouncers literally shoved my friend's husband off the dance floor.  After seeing that, my husband went straight to the bar.  I joined him at the bar, and had a cranberry vodka.  We were able to get our drinks quickly, despite the crowds.  
2.  But now we are separated from our friends.  When I attempt to go back on the dance floor to see if they are still there; they again, stop my husband.  I am able to get on the floor and find that they have left.
3.  We wait around to get on the dance floor, and I guess because they have too many people, they have blocked all entrances to the dance floor.  Seriously?
4.  At this point, we decide to leave.  What's the point of going to a dance club if you can't get on the dance floor.  So, we go to leave and the exit is a flight of stairs (so much fun in heels), down what feels like a back fire escape.

The dance floor is a decent size and super high DJ booth is very exciting. At certain points they released confetti down to the crowd, which was fun. The dancers are also really attractive. The other two levels are smaller and don't seem that exciting. Looking down the balcony is pretty great.  

The best part about Marquee was the abundant number of couches and chairs and seats. On the main floor there are comfy couches outside the bathroom to rest your weary feet, and stools inside the bathroom. The bathroom is stocked with candies and other little useful necessities.

Nightclub:

It's not the greatest nighclub on the strip but its decent. They have a pool that looks pretty but nothing like XS. It's really hard to get a drink at the bar. The dance floor is kind of strange and hard to find a place to boogie. Not very memorable and got really uncomfortably crowded that the group just ended up bouncing.

Dayclub:

I'm a fan! It really helps to be on the guestlist or just know someone who can help get you in.  If not, get there EARLY because the line gets RIDICULOUS after 11AM. Luckily for my group, we've been able to get in pretty easily and avoid the long wait. There are places along the edge of the pool to park your bikini bottoms down (or trunks...or speedos...) and hang out. The pool feels amazing in the blazing heat. It's very easy to get drinks (~$10) and they open the inside of the club so you don't have to be stuck melting outside. Bartenders are sexy and super friendly. They were also selling poolside popsicles that we dipped and broke into our drinks and made vodka smoothies with.

OK STORY TIME!

We found a great spot to hang out (near the waterfall under the shade) and got ourselves situated, unaware of the sex show that was about to commence behind us on the cabana. Why there were some butter faced girls humping each other and purposely exposing their tatas was beyond me, but I'll bet it began with TE and ended with KILLA. But hey, maybe you'll get lucky next time and run into these girls.

The end.",2,5,1

After checking in with ID, our party is escorted to the back (dark and gloomy hallway) to take the elevator up to the rooftop (at least I thought we were). After stepping out of the elevator, there's a security check to inspect the bags. Ladies, make sure you leave big purses or bags at the hotel or car; they are very particular about the size of the bag to bring in, lunch bag size or smaller is probably okay. There are metal lockers outside of the security gate to store the items at $30.  Crazy!  After the security let us in, there is another metal staircase to access the rooftop pool, again, with another security guard to check the party.

Overall, there are lots of security checks, but the pool is okay.  Restrooms are clean, and the falling water backdrop is cool for photo shoots. The pool is very shallow, up to mid-calves, and one can barely immerse in to enjoy the pool on a hot day.  Not a lot of shaded area near the pool.  There are some cool looking cabana\/daybeds, but be ready to spend some serious dough for that.  Found many cigarette butts in the pool, very unpleasant.

Yasssss hunny ! This was the first stop on our girls weekend and our first day party. I was with my 2 best friends and several days before our trip we reached out to a great promoter, Chris Hornak that really hooked us up. 

We arrived around 12pm, received free admission and an open bar with vodka drinks from 1 until 2 ! Ummmm yes please. The pool was huge and I appreciated the smaller pool towards the back, that's were we made camp. There was seating and a nice shady spot waiting for us. The bartenders were also quick and friendly. After that open bar we decided to order some fries that were also very tasty or maybe that was the alcohol. Either way order here lol

Came here with a large group of friends this past Sunday. With five women and six men our ratio work out where the five girls and four guys got in for free, while two of the guys in our group had to pay 40$ each. All employees were nice and friendly from the bouncers to the bartenders. 

We arrived close to the beginning of the night so the girls got free drinks for the first hour. Which was smart because drinks on average run from $20-40 for small 4oz drink. Super pricey even for Vegas. Lockers were $40 so if you share its not that bad. Or if you come early you can claim a spot, stay near their and not pay. 

I will say that it was beyond crowed with people who don't want to go in the pool. If you aren't planning on swimming then don't come here because there are so many other clubs and i would think with the main area being a pool this place would be pointless for you. But if you are planning on swimming and at least lounging by the water you will be making the most of it. Like any pool with a lot of people the water was a little dirty but who cares, shower after. I was in the water for hours and has the best experience.

I took two stars away because the drinks were outrageously pricey and the lifeguards had no idea what they were doing. Having experience as a lifeguard these guys were about as bad as they come. I did however add a star back because my fiance lost his shirt somewhere in the club and we were walking out, when one of the bouncers said hold on a minute and gave him a shirt to wear so he didn't have to walk around cold at 4am. 

Overall I would say it was a great time, and a good place to go for large groups.",0,0,0

Marquee is probably one of the more popular clubs on the Strip. Yes, it's gorgeous and lush and all things Vegas, but I was really surprised by how horribly it was designed. This quickly diluted my enjoyment of what is otherwise a beautiful club. 

#1. The line outside the door is long, and yes, it's long because there's a freaking mob inside, but also because to gain entry, you must enter an elevator to get to the upper floors leading to the club. What genius decided this?? Someone who surely loves to make everyone and his momma wait. 

#2. The bathrooms, the way to the bathrooms, the total nonexistent signs leading to the bathroom were horrid.  Hey, if I was a club-designer who didn't want the lovely floors to get puked\/peed on, what would I do? Not what Marquee did, and that is make the restrooms completely invisible from the dance floor. No signs, no prominent entryway, no nothing. Just a darkened corridor that leads to a hallway (where the wind blew in and toppled you over nonetheless) with weird art. Once inside the bathroom, you're crammed inside, until some loud bathroom attendant literally orders you to a stall. I was sitting there, peeing, thinking the attendant would yell at me to stop peeing and get out! 

Also, some support for my argument - someone puked on the floors and we had to take a detour. 

#3.  The long haul back to exit the club. It was a looong trip to exit the club. You have to take around 3 flights of stairs through the ugliest part of the club. This is probably the worst for women in heels. And yet, if they can provide an elevator UP to the club, why not provide it down, when people are inebriated and tired?

As my friends were eating at Holstein's, they saw the line grow starting at 8pm to get into the Marquee. Around 9:45pm, we decided to go wait in line. It turns out there's a separate line for hotel guests which was much shorter. After a little running around so that I could get our group of 6 in, it turns out that only 2 hotel guests per room are allowed to go in for free. However, my other 4 friends were able to skip the lines and pay cover. $20 for girls, $40 for guys. So all the running around was worth it in the end. 

I also learned that hotel guests will always be able to get into the Marquee no matter how busy the night is excluding, of course, paid concerts like the Black Keys. 

We take an elevator to the main room of the Marquee and it is packed. And a rude bunch of a crowd too. A lot of pushing and shoving. We couldn't dance. By 10:30pm, there was already a fight on the main floor. 

The DJs are awesome and it was great to see Above & Beyond. The sound system is fantastic.  I can hear and feel the bass in my hotel room on the 69th floor. 

But the stairs are a killer. I wore my heels for an hour and went back to my hotel room to change to my flats. And what a difference! Screw heels here. And the dress code wasn't consistent. There were a few people wearing sweats and regular day clothes. So I didn't feel bad about wearing flats. 

The bouncers are great and really nice. 

My favorite room is on the 3rd floor in the Library. There are doors on the opposite side of the bar. Go through them and you'll be on a balcony overlooking the main room. It is awesome.

We were on a guestlist, so we arrived at 9:30, since doors opened at 10. The line was already pretty long for both general admission and GL.

For the GL line, once 10PM hit, the guys with the lists walked down the line, gave you the piece of paper to say how much (or not) you have to pay to get in. Behind them, there was another bouncer that was checking ID's and stamping people so when you got to the front of the line, they didn't have to do that. Unfortunately, no one communicated with each other that they were doing that...so we still had two bouncers at the front check our ID's and try to stamp our hands, only to realize that someone else had beat them to it.

Since there were only three of us, two girls and one guy, the GL guy comped the guy...which was amazing to me. I didn't think that any guy could get into a LV club for free. I finally realized why it takes so long to get the line moving, because you have to go up elevators. Gotcha, same situation with Moon at The Palms.

Once we got into the club, the girls had wristbands to get free drinks until 11PM. Well, we got into the club at 10:40, so we basically hit up every bar on the main level before 11PM. They make strong drinks and since there are so many bars throughout the club, none of them were super crowded early on. 

The best bar to go to is the one after the exit to the patio because it's tucked away, but it's pretty big. They had a lot of staff working, a lot of them were just standing around waiting for it to get packed.  We went downstairs to the Boombox room and upstairs to the library. Then we came back upstairs when RedFoo got on stage. 

It was insane...the sound quality in the club is amazing. The crowd was going crazy and RedFoo put on a great show. The go-go's were entertaining up above the crowd. 

I'm a club promoter, I've been to many clubs. But this by far is my favorite one I've ever been to. XS is nice, but Marquee has something for everyone in your group.

Basically,  two of my friends and I had a couple drinks at the bar, then we went to the dance floor and started dancing. My friend and I decided to take another shot at the bar...While we were walking to the bar, we got stopped by the security and asked us to follow them. At this point, I thought that, ""I guess I am really fucked up and I'm going to get kicked out!""

So we continue to follow the security, which leaded us into a room. Next thing the security in the room yelled at us and said, ""Where is the E? Why are you guys selling E?""  The fact that we did not have any E or drugs, my friend and I were really confused. We told them we didn't have any drugs, but the security kept yelling and questioning us and even said that they got us on tape for evidence.

At this point, I was EXTREMELY frustrated and felt very disrespected, so I took all my belongs out from my pocket and told them,"" Find the fucking E if you can!!!""  Since they couldn't find E or drugs, you would think that they would apologize for the mistake and let us go... HELL to the Fucking No... They said, ""Here's the deal: you guys are banned from Marquee, Tao and the Cosmopolitan property forever.""

Then, you probably pay off the fire marshall to WAY OVERPACK the club to levels where dangerous mobs of people will literally crush you between between. You can not walk anywhere... and everywhere you try and stand the bouncer says, ""You have to move. You can't stand there. Sorry, you can't stand there either. You have to move."" Move WHERE?! 

The dancefloor is *tiny*. Too bad they wasted all the space on the patio. The stage\/light show set up is amazing and the sound system good, BUT, amidst all the bad stuff, please... stay far, far away. 

Side note: my girlfriend and her dude ordered 1 round of 2 drinks at the bar and the tab for those 2 drinks?? $55!!! Insane. Also, 80% of the club is asian so you better be OK with that too.",5,6,2

For one, the place is super small.  Even with purchasing a cabana, its pretty cramped for room and we even had people asking us to pay for beach chairs, just so they could have somewhere to sit.  Its a huge pool dead in the middle and a few smaller pools surrounding.  But the biggest thing is almost the DJ booth (how absurd is that).

Price wise its basically like everything else in Vegas, extremely pricey.  But I think this place is more ideal for bachelorette parties and things of that nature.  For those looking for more fun and more importantly more room, I'd definitely go to Encore and Rehab.",1,0,0

I can't find much positive to say about the Marquee. We bought tickets to Ferry Corsten before we got to Vegas and figured since we were going to see Tiesto we should see Ferry if he was gonna be there.....
So the tickets cost us $5 more since we were guys. Ok, as much as I detest that, I will play along.
It was nearly impossible to tell where to line up. The elevators never came down to pick us up so we ventured around until some randoms directed us where we might go. Nothing obvious about it. We found a line and got in it. Again, not obvious because there were a few. I will say that the wait was fine. I saw lots of comments in previous posts about waiting for hours but we waited about 10 mins. I have no idea if it was because we had tickets or not. And there were 4 of us guys which didn't seem to be a problem though they did let in a huge group of ladies ahead of us. 
So I don't know if this club was an afterthought for The Cosmopolitan, but that stairs thing everyone commented on is pure craziness. At least 5 flights of metal stairs through what looked much like a parking garage. I was slightly outta breath when we finally got to the top and I am in pretty good shape. I felt bad for the ladies with 4-5 inch heels. Especially on the way back down after a few drinks. We got herded into the bar, and since we knew there couldn't possibly be any chance of a transition from hip hop to trance we decided to ask a boucer how we get to another part of the bar. The hip hop room was jam packed. 
After finding our way upstairs (a common theme for the next hour was having no idea where we were, where anything was) the music sounded pretty good, house music at last :)  The drinks were $15, but it's Vegas, I suppose I get it. This floor is also insanely packed, can't move, getting bumped into constantly, $1-$2 of our drinks spilling each time. The outside area was nice, a good breeze. Besides the outside area tho, there was literally nowhere to stand. Seems the entire bar was VIP. We couldn't get close to the dancefloor and Ferry wasn't even on yet. We couldn't stand in the area close to the dancefloor cause the bouncers, albeit friendly ones told us we couldn't stand there. And we didn't have VIP so we ended up in a small corner off to the side of the stage where we could see nothing. Four of us were left standing around looking at each other in bewilderment. Wtf are we doing here?? After a couple of bathroom trips (nobody I saw had any clue where the bathrooms were) and the night getting later, it got ridiculous. You literally couldn't move at times. And with no chance of coming close to the dancefloor, nowhere to stand, certainly not dance, we decided that as much as we love some Corsten, we'd have to settle for some YouTube vids or music on our iPods if we wanted to hear him. 
It was just stupid. And sooooo not worth it. Not for a second. Unless all of that sounds appealing. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. I will say the bartenders and bouncers were friendly. But that wasn't nearly enough. See-ya! Ugh. We won't be back. No for any dj, and i'd go to the ends of the earth to see some of 'em.",0,1,0

Marquee - a club for the masses, where they treat like you like cattle unless you have a table with bottle service.  It's not the employees' particular fault that they yell and shove you and tell you to keep it moving.  It's a result of the layout of the club in the main room.

The small dance floor is a circle with its perimeter surrounded by tables.  It looked like they dedicated equal or more real estate to tables than common areas.  Sucked for us folks who don't feel like blasting a few grand to party.  From a business perspective, I guess this is smart so that they can maximize revenue from bottle service. 

Don't bother going to this club if you don't get a table.  Thank goodness my friends and I knew someone so we didn't have to wait in line and pay cover.  I would have been upset if I had to pay a fee to enter a very crowded club just to be treated like an animal.

Went on a Saturday night w\/ DJ Kascade spinning (starting at 1am).  Like typical Vegas clubs, they had an acrobatic performer and dancers once he came out.

Drink prices are average (for Vegas).  3 kamikaze shots were $42.  Plenty of stalls in the bathrrom for the ladies so there wasn't a long line.  They also had lots of chairs in front of the mirror so that you can freshen up.

Pool area outside was also open, but who wants to hang around outside when it's still in the 90's during the summer even at nightime?

Inside, the a.c. system was great, because it didn't feel muggy like some clubs can get when it gets packed.

Huge range of people in the crowd, from men in their upper 40's\/50's trying to party like they're in their 20's again and loving the attention they get from the gogo dancers\/cocktail waitresses to people who just turned 21 and are clubbing for the first time.  But most of the people look like the ""forever 21\/jersey shore"" crowd.  Then again, most folks at the Cosmopolitan hotel in general look like that.",1,0,0

He was playing at Marquee Dayclub and he heard some great things about it. We bought tickets in advance, which turned out to be the way to go, and got us in very easy. Met up with Melvin, who is the man at Marquee and he got us set up with a great table near the pool. The unfortunate part about that Sunday was the weather, awful! Things were blowing all around the pool, freezing cold, and people were just not feeling it. Most dayclubs, probably would just let everyone bare through it and not do to much else.

Not Marquee! They clearly put in alot of work and moved the ENTIRE dayclub, in to, the night club! AWESOME. We got to see part of Aeroplanes set inside and then Norman Cook came up to tear the roof off. It was an awesome scene with everyone in their bikini's and boardshorts dancing inside, totally fun.

Our waitress was absolutely awesome, very attentive and took care of us very well. A+ service for sure. All of the hosts were equally great and really worked to make sure everyone was happy. Oh and the food was delicious as well, from what I can remember?

My usual Vegas crew loves EDM music and before Hakkasan and Light opened up, Marquee was THE best place for EDM music.  Although in my opinion, I like XS just a little bit more, Marquee still holds its own. 

Highlights of Marquee

-Large and gorgeous venue: It is both an indoor and outdoor club so there's a small, correction, very small, dance floor and an even better outdoor section with a pool, gambling tables, bottle service tables, cabanas, and a bar.  Warning, they do not let you go into the pool like XS does, do not even think about putting your feet in there.  Just stay away from the pool and you will be fine.  There is also a smaller hip hop room that you see, on your right, when you're walking up the stairs.  Why anyone would even want to be in that room is something I will never understand.  It is small so it gets very hot, and honestly if you want hip hop music go to 1Oak or something.  You are not getting the Marquee experience in that room.

-Awesome DJ's: I've seen Gareth Emory, Armin (sorta), Above and Beyond (twice), and Markus Schulz, just to name a few. 

-Free drinks and early table service for groups of girls: I guess if you get there early enough and they have unsold tables and you have a good group of girls.  They will set you up with a table and one free drink.  You can stay there for as long as the table is unsold, after they sell the table, and believe me, they will sell the table, then you have to leave.  

-Clean bathrooms: Ladies, the bathroom at Marquee is wonderful.  Clean and there's plenty of stalls, you never have to wait that long for a stall.  They are a little hard to find though, but head towards coat check and you'll find the restroom.

Cons of Marquee

-The stairs into and out of the club.  Unless you're one of the lucky few who get to take the elevator, get ready to work out them legs and walk up and down the stairs. 

-Density of crowd: It gets ridiculously packed in there, and unless you have a table it is really hard to move, let alone dance if you are on the dance floor.  Everyone just ends up chilling outside cause it gets so packed and hot in there.

-Security: This can be a pro and a con, because I will admit security does do their job, but damn they are so strict and mean.  Like I said, pro and con because I like the fact that they are good at their job but they are also a*******. 

Tips: Try to go in with either an even ratio of guys and girls or more girls than guys.  Drinks are pricey, people stop whining about drink prices.  If you want cheap drinks go buy a bottle and drink in your hotel room.  Nobody said Vegas was cheap.",8,4,4

Who designed this place? The main dance floor is the size of an average 1bd apartment. Then you have several tables around, but you cannot touch them, even if you are PUSHED into them (what happens really often, since 50 people can make that dance floor crowded). EXTREMELY RUDE STAFF (except to the nice girl at the bar outside). The security guy decided to move those lines that separate the dance floor from the tables CLOSER to the crowd, even though there was a WALL right BEHIND IT and - of course - the crowd would push the damn thing back into the wall anyway. WHAT IS THE POINT OF PUSHING EVERYBODY AGAINST EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO HAVE ONE FOOT OF ROOM TO NOBODY? 
I see many people here complaining about stairs... This is a one star review and I even took the elevator up. It's further ahead from the entrance that says Marquee in front of the bar in the main floor.
The crowd was so bad, pushing around, rubbing their dicks into girls when we would be pushed to each other like sardines.
But then it comes the worst part...
At 3 in the morning they closed a part of the outside. Then at 3:15 they started pushing everybody towards the inside because, apparently ""they need to get people pumping inside"" HOW? THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO ROOM THERE. Ok... Then we decided to stay right next to the outside bar, just to find out that if we wanted to go to the restrooms, we would have to stay inside.

The first time I came here I had to wait over an hour in line to get in, and I got there early.  This time my boy talked to one of the promoters and let us in through the ""secret line.""

This place is huge.  3 levels, the bottom level plays hip hop, the main level plays edm, and the top level is pretty much just a little lounge to chill.  I don't know why I can't give this place 5 stars.  It has so much potential.  Marquee books big name DJs to perform on the main stage.  The light wall behind the DJ is incredible.  If you don't like EDM you can go downstairs to get your groove on to some hip hop.  If you're a little tired you can go upstairs and take a break.  There's even access from the main floor to get outside by the pool for some fresh air.  And there's beautiful women everywhere. 

Here's where Marquee needs to rethink.  So you decide to make your club huge, 3 levels in fact, but there's a limited number of elevators you can access to get from floor to floor. No one wants to wait 20 minutes to get to from floor to floor.  Then you think it's okay there's stairs. The worst idea.  Nobody wants to walk a million flights of stairs either.  Invest in a ESCALATOR PLEASE!  Also, Marquee has to be breaking the capacity law because it's like sardines in the damn place.  I don't want other dudes rubbing up on me while they're trying to get pass me. 

On a side note: if you get faded, most likely you won't even care about all these problems.  So just have a lot to drink, and enjoy all the potential Marquee has.",1,1,0

My best friend and I planned a trip for Vegas for a concert and just happened to be there the same weekend Avicii was performing here. Luckily, a few of our friends knew the promoters here, so we got in for free and were one of the first few people to get into the club early to kinda explore the place. I advise you show up there around 930 or so if you don't wanna wait in crazy lines! The place started to get packed around 11&it gets worse from there (Keep in mind we were there on a saturday night).

LADIES, I know the club scene is all about dress to impress, but seriously, if you're gonna wear sky high heels, I'm almost positive you'll end up hobbling around bare foot by the end of the night. The club has 3 floors; the elevators are pretty crazy because of the high volume of people going in&out of the club. Unless you're happy all night with the floor you're on, you'll probably be taking the stairs a lot. I saw a ton of girls walking around holding their heels as the night went on. At one point, my heels were giving me unbearable pain, so one of the friendly promoters mentioned that some of their bathrooms sold slippers\/flip flops for $10. PURE GENIUS. THANK GOODNESS. My throbbing feet were in heaven.

There are tables for bottle service basically everywhere you go on each floor. There's not too many places to sit down by the time the place gets packed... so I guess it really depends if you want your wallet or feet crying by the end of the night. 

Good music always playing. The main floor is always house; they have a ton of good resident DJs for you EDM lovers, (Avicii, Kaskade, Above&Beyond, ATB, Cosmic Gate, &tons more) and even line up a lot of good guest DJs as well! The floor below it is the Boom Box, always playing hip hop. &The top floor is The Library, a small room with a lounge vibe; they got a pool table, bar, book shelves, a fire place, even bottle service tables here too.

Not quite what comes to mind when I think of Marquee.  Not that there aren't beautiful people, I'm sure there are...  But there's no way in hell you're going to see them in there.
Once you get past the daunting lines (unless you're in a bachelorette party and one of the girls has the hook-up, holla!), you're left with a sense of ""holy shit, is this really what I waited for?""  Entrance to the club starts with a climb up about a bajillion flights of stairs (or at least it sure feels like it in heels!).  No special view, just dark staircases.  You finally make it to the club, good luck finding a spot to dance in.  We wandered for about fifteen minutes, found some outside area, and looked for a cabana to crash.  No welcoming cabanas, just a friendly guy to buy the bride a shot.
Fast forward twenty minutes, we find the girl who promised us a free table.  A free table turned into one free drink per girl.  Ok, thats fine with me.  The music was good, the bar continued to be dark & excessively cloudy, no matter where in the club we ended up.
We finally made it up to some little library\/study looking room.  We got yelled at for leaning against the couch to fidget with our shoe, so we hightailed it out of there.  Apparently this was the room the big spenders paid ridiculous amounts of money to be ini, just to stare at another bunch of dudes in a library.  If that's your thing, enjoy!
Other than that, we just found ourselves wandering around the whole time, looking for a cool place to stake ourselves.  No luck, so we left for XS.

First time I went we had a table in the hip hop room. Table to the left was the Dallas Cowboys and the table to the right was G-Unit. Kind of who cares but somewhat cool at the same time. $4000 for 3 bottles of Henny. The second time was in the main room and the table was right by the stage. I had a blast!!!

The Library is the main dance floor area and the Boombox is downstairs and is a smaller hip hop area.

They now have blackjack tables set up outside which is a decent way to kill some time if you happen to get there a little early.

The lines are long, it's a pain to get in, the drinks are expensive, the tables are ridiculously expensive...and the girls are hot.  In general the bouncers are pretty good at keeping the douchebag factor relatively low.",2,1,1

... to be fair I went during the day, and bottle service was only $200 for a cabana and $75 for a lounge chair. They just had to tell me what a great deal that was compared to the prices at night.  
We overheard the bouncers making fun of a couple of guests in a cabana.  So apparently, even when you pay for a place to sit down, you are still not important enough.  

I heard from a limo driver that a lot of the new clubs are doing this.  The owners plan on selling within a year, so they use the bottle service to rape the suckers who want to be seen with a table at the new clubs.  As soon as people get tired of the experience, the owners sell and go start another club.  They never have to pay the price for failing to provide a good product.  He expected the Marquee to sell within a year.

Welcome to Marquee Nightclub & Dayclub. Everybody wants in.

Is it because their drinks are out of this world? Maybe they have a huge dancefloor? Or maybe they let everyone in free and you just have to wait in line? The answer is a big fat NO.

Marquee came into the Vegas club game with their mind on the money... and money on their mind. They knew EDM (Electronic Dance Music) was on the verge of climaxing all over Sin City and they took full advantage of that. Installing state-of-the-art sound systems by Funktion One and placing world class producers & djs in exclusive residency contracts propelled Marquee into nightlife superstardom on the Las Vegas strip since Day 1... literally... they had their Grand Opening on New Year's Eve last year. 

I've been here so many times in the last year, I can't begin to count it. Sometimes I get in on discounted guestlists, sometimes I get in via pre-sale tickets, sometimes it's bottle service... but I NEVER EVER wait in line for hours-upon-hours. Except for Halloween 2011... when I decided to drive up to Vegas on a whim after work on Monday (yes wtf was Halloween on a Monday) to see KASKADE... no presales in hand meant waiting about 2.5 hours to get into the club but it was WORTH it to dance to Kaskade til 6am... take a nap at my friend's penthouse suite then drive straight back to LA for work.

The trick is to come early, get stamped then go do your thing. One thing I like about Vegas clubs is that they allow in-and-outs... and I'm not talking about that disgusting SoCal based burger chain. Take advantage of their generosity and come early, get stamped then go grab food, drink drink drink drunk drunk or finish your hair and makeup. This applies for both Nightclub and Dayclub. Oh ladies, if you're coming to Dayclub, have a pair of heels ready in your bag, just cause it's a pool party doesn't mean they're not looking for ladies in heels to let through the line.",4,1,2

We walked into Cosmo and saw the hideous, disgustingglyyy long line and I was ready to leave. Luckily we met a manager who was able to walk us through upstairs. I went up and down floor to floor, chilled at the outside bar area, danced on the dance flooor... I was just all over the place! But sadly Marquee only amused me for a couple of hours, then I get bored and wanted to leave by 1am. Because of this, I have not gone back for the nightclub but I plan on giving it another chance soooon.

SO, the reason why I LOVE LOVE LOVE MARQUEE is because of my first dayclub experience. My girls and I went for memorial day weekend Sunday; our friend\/promoter got us in right away and I could see how the outside COULD be HELLA fun, but omg that day was ridiculously windy. Shit was flying all over the place, girls were covered in towels, you could barely hear Afrojack over the wind. We spent the first hour deciding if we should leave or not but decided to just get a few drinks in us and see if it got better. 30 minutes later we were all buzzed, but still freezing and not having a good time.

THAT was UNTIL someone :) and the owner of Marquee decided to open the nightclub dancefloor\/table area during the DAY. It was amazing. One minute I was wrapped in a towel, shivering, sipping on Sangria and the next minute I was in my bikini, dancing my ass off, getting personally served unlimited DOM P, Goose, and Patron next to the owner of Marquee and a very very very generous man! That table was ... wow. 

It was EPIC. I remember checking the time and seeing that it was 2pm but I felt like it was 2am. I have a snapshot in my mind of all of my girls all in the nightclub in our bikinis and sandals, dancing the fucking DAY away, and having the time of our lives. Definitely on the list of my top favorite times in Vegas! Thank you MARQUEE !!!!!",12,12,14

The best part was the DJ!  I go to the same conference every year and there is usually dancing but I never saw so many people dance for so long as I did at this event.   He was seriously skilled at getting everyone, no matter age, gender, race or religion out on the dance floor.   His mixes were terrific and made you eager to hear what he'd play next.   I am not a dancing guy but I was out on the floor for over an hour!

The part I wasn't crazy about was after I ran out of drink tickets, I had to buy my own beer and dropped $11 for a bottle of Stella!  (Plus a tip).   Honestly, I was offended by having to pay that much for such a mediocre beer.

Night club: 
Super popular DJ's (Avicii, Above and Beyond, Kaskade, etc), ridiculous lights, confetti cannons and disco balls. Unfortunately, the dance floor is small and gets crowded. Plus, the inside is super confusing. Mainly because my first time there I had a little too much fun at the pre-party, didn't realize the place was a circle, and basically walked in circles for 30 or so minutes before a friend stopped me. Whoops.

Day club:
Really really hot waitresses walking around in tiny swim suits, guys that are more than willing to buy you drinks\/invite you to their table\/give you free drinks (all okay in my book), and girls that like to take their swimsuit tops off, get yelled at by servers to put their swim suit tops back on, and proceed to pout and whine because they weren't allowed to take their swimsuits off.

Okay the last one only happened once, but it was hi-larious to watch.

Trust me, if you come to Marquee either during the day or night, you will have an amazing time people watching, dancing, and enjoying good music.

Make sure to get on a list. Girls are typically free but guys have to pay, just like all clubs in Vegas. Sorry boys, Vegas is the only place where women have a one up in the world. Deal with it.",7,7,4

i dont know how i did it...

all i had was a name and ""the only guy with a goatee"" as identification for our tickets inside. and hello mr. facial hair! he made eye contact with me and i got us girls in at 1:30am. amazing....pays to be assertive when everyone else gives up! 

$20 cover :-\/

Every time I've been at the club, the Boombox room plays all the best hip hop songs that I can get a serious groove on to. It gets pretty serious. 

Yea yea yea this place has great dance music too, but honestly there's DJs every damn club here so I don't feel the electro dance music selection sets them apart from the other clubs on the strip. 

Dance music plays at the main floor and you can find the hip hop one floor below. If you want to take a break from all the chaos, you can hang out in The Library where it's more of a lounge setting, or just hang at the outdoor pools (assuming it's not winter time). 

The thing I don't like about Marquee, is that the staff all seem like they have a giant purple stick up their a-hole. More specifically, the bouncers, but then again who can blame them when they're dealing with lots of eager people who think they're too cool to wait. If you're a guy, good luck. Either you wait in a long line, buy a bottle, or pay the bouncer a big fat tip to jump ahead of everyone. Even with purchasing a bottle, you'll still have to wait in a line so that might not be the easiest way out. I believe minimum for a table is $500. Best thing to do is find a promotor out on the strip and get on the list, that could at least help avoid a lot of bs you'll have to go through before even getting in. Entry fee for guys is $50.

And if you're a girl, bring like 5+ more girls with you so you don't have to deal with all that mess period. I'm not promising you 100% won't have a hard time either though. Again, get on a list and get in free! If not and you just want to take your chances and show up, I believe cover for girls is $20. 

There's definitely a price to pay to get in to one of the most popular clubs in town!

Such as the multiple rooms and unique layout. Very cool and interesting while sober but extremely difficult to maneuver and keep track of after a few drinks. It's great that there are a few different settings to fit people's individual preference. We briefly walked through the hip hop room, which was small and packed, on our way outside. In November, it was quite chilly so we quickly headed upstairs to the main room. Then we wandered up even more stairs to the library, which had a nice, laidback vibe, which I would have liked better had there been a place to sit. As the night progressed and I had a few drinks, I found that locating the nearest bathroom and then finding my way back to my friends was a nearly impossible challenge. Luckily, I somehow managed to find my way but it was not without difficulty. 

I know there are plenty of people who like the techno\/house that's played in the main AKA largest room but I've never been a fan. I need words to get into a song and dance. I remember excitedly shouting to my friend when a song with words finally blasted after an hour of steady beats. 

We were lucky enough to 1) get hooked up with free entrance by a friend's promoter and 2) be welcomed to someone's table for the night. I guarantee that my feet would not have survived an entire night of standing in heels so a huge thank you to the guy who let us crash at his table!  

Another interesting note, there are a lot of stairs, including a random, vacant stairwell up to the club. Makes for an interesting evening for girls in high heels.",0,0,0

Ladies... you know how you read all the reviews about all the stairs..

of stairs entail.

THE STAIRS..........

in progress. please proceed to the stairs to exit the building. 
So... imagine the stair way going down to escape a building except youre 
going up the stairs to go to the club... NOT THE BUSINESS...

Tip: Ladies if you got a promoter. Do what your promoter says
       he is your life line to get inside of the club quickly.

Me and my friends came here on a Saturday Night this time instead of a Monday. The door man did not give us any trouble this time around although I asked him to play a little joke on my boy (denying him entry bc his ID was suspect lol) got a good laugh out of it too.. 

Once again there were beautiful women all around this establishment. In my opinion out of all the clubs I have been to in Vegas Marquee seems to have the prettiest women. Some were Stuck Up (As Expected) and some were Mad cool.. Got a few women that thought I was a Taye Diggs\/NeYo look alike when I smile or have a cretan look in my face which I've heard before so it wasn't a real shock to me. But they were good fun to hang with and they bought me shots due to the fact I was a 4th of July baby. 

I also came back here bc when I came here last year the Hip-Hop Room wasn't open due to the fact we came on a Monday. This time it was open and it was DUMB crackin in there and hella packed just like the Main Room. With all the music I was accustomed to back home in the Bay Area. 

But yea great service, no drama, good conversations, dancing with women and good drunk birthday fun. I just wish they made the dance floors bigger tho and  that I had Bottle Service so I can feel cooler haha.

Went in early May on a monday night and it was freezing.  We had bottle service outside but i was so cold it was almost unenjoyable!  The music outside wasn't even that loud so it wasn't fun to dance outside, we went to the dance foor inside.

Still giving it 4 stars because of the AMAZING service, gorgeous hotel and club, and location!  Cosmo is the nicest hotel on the strip and the best location!  Walking around the Cosmo you keep looking up at the gorgeous chandelier.  We got bottle service that night and we met one of the promoters outside the entrance and they escorted us up an elevator to our table outside (big mistake when its freezing, but its our fault not the clubs)

So normally you get bottle service and they bring you the mixers, glasses, etc and you never see them until the end of the night.  But this place is crazyy they would take away dirty napkins and cups right after we put them down (as if they were watching us) and we got fresh chasers, straws, new glasses, limes etc within seconds of us needing it! We got treated super well and none of the security gaurds, promoters, acted like they ran vegas.  I will always remember how wonderful the staff of this club is!

Marquee night club-HORRIBLE
Our group with 7 girls went there with a group of guys who reserved a table on 8\/30 night. The door did not let us get in with the boys. The entrance fee was double that night from $20 to $40. So we all paid $40 to go in to have a good time. But when we got in, there were way too many people. We literally had to push people to walk. The security was mean and just kept yelling at us to ""keep moving"" when you did not know where to move to. Because it was too crowded, I decided to leave earlier. Then there were five-level of stairs that you have to climb to get out. I took off my heels because it's too painful. It's like you were going to limbo with endless stairs. I finally got to the ground level then I got yelled at the door by a guy to ask me to wear my shoes. EXCUSE ME! I was about to walk out from this place. Why you are yelling at me??? Overall experience: over pricy, SUPER RUDE staff and security, way too crowded

Marquee day club: RUDE STAFF
My girlfriends got VIP passes so we decided to give marquee day club another try the next day on 8\/31 because some girls heard good things. Most of my friends went around noon and got in with VIP passes. Me and another friend went later and arrived the door around 3:05 pm. We asked the door if we can get in with the VIP passes. The door guy went to talk to a bald guy who seems was the guy who was in charge the door. He then told us that the VIP pass was only good until 3 pm. We tried to tell them that we have 5 girlfriends were inside and we came here bc of the passes. We also asked him where it said on the pass that the entrance was only good till 3 pm bc i could not find it anywhere. The bald guy then said the pass actually ended at 2 pm instead of 3 pm. At this point, we were super confused. He then told us it is only $20 to get in and asked us to pay. He yelled at us saying ""it's only $20. You cannot even pay $20. It is very cheap"" The bald guy was super RUDE and OUTRAGEOUS.

The guy I spoke to at the entrance was a real jerk. Did not even stop walking away mid-conversation until I agreed to the $500 minimum for bottle service. Wish I could call him out here, but I didn't get his name for fear of retribution. He was a real a-hole. He only started acting human after I agreed to the price. The owner should have his staff wear nametages, but obviously, they don't care about customer service.

Anyhow, the Asian kid who took us up the elevator was nice. Pretty much downhill from there.

We got to our daybed in the pool with high hopes. After a lot of arm-twisting, we got moved to a spot with more shade. Understand: it was about 11:30am on a Thursday. The place was practically dead.

We loved it the first few hours, however, it spiraled downhill after there. My biggest complaint is the security makes no effort at all to keep those of us who are paying for bottle service separated from the masses who will swoop down and take your spot as soon as you turn your back. Everyone is allowed everywhere, which is very stressful for two people trying to get their money's worth while acting as their own security versus hundreds of drunk people desperate for shade; which we had and was in short supply.

Furthermore, my wife kept asking the staff what would happen when the numerous beach balls in the pool got thrown and knocked over our bottle of booze. She was told ""it won't happen."" Sure enough, it did. Who woulda thunk it with all those drunks having fun? I get it, but when we told them what happened, we had to practically beg for replacement drinks, which didn't equal what got spilled in the pool.

Was here 2 weeks ago for Kaskade's set once again and just like before the energy was OFF THE HOOK!  However this time around, me and my friends decide to pitch in and get a grand cabana. My host set me up prior and within 5min of arriving to marquee, down the elevators and onto my table.

The Grand Cabanas are located on the patio on the left hand side. Its a short walk from the main room but isnt bad at all. The cabana provided air and a place to party when I wasnt on the main floor shuffling the night away.  This by far was the best night of my life and the bill speaks for itself.

The Marquee, visually is incredible! The decor is very modern and the layout is unique in comparison to other clubs in town.  

Pros-
 * Awesome layout \/ Decor ... visually stimulating!
 * Music variety 
 * Friendly staff
 * Fast guest line 
Cons-
 * Drinks are extremely expensive!  3 drinks for nearly $50 !
 * dance floors are way overcrowded
  
Tips-
 * hold on to the railing when you go up\/down those stairs!  especially if you've been drinking.
 * drink before you get in!
 * Get here early unless you want to be waiting in line forever.
 * Monday is industry nights and free for locals.  

Overall, I like this place.  I can't wait to go back (most likely on industry night) where it's free for locals.  Can't wait to explore this place more in-depth next time I come.  So far so good!  I didn't like the drink prices, but what do you expect from a trendy Vegas nightclub?  Don't let the long line intimidate.  It was extremely long, but the wait wasn't that bad considering the line was that long!  They seemed to be pretty organized.",1,0,1

My friend and I arrived here pretty early (10:15pm) and even though we were on guest list, the line was ENORMOUS. So we approached the main door security and after some friendly banter and conversation with the security guys, we were walked right in, bypassed the lines (including the line for the elevator) and brought right into the main floor. I thought that was incredibly nice of them as they didn't have to do that. I was surprised to see so many bad reviews about the security in this club, I never not once thought they were rude or obnoxious, they are simply trying to do their job whilst having to deal with a load of drunken idiots.

So perhaps they could have not filled the club quite as much as they did but my friend and I spent all evening at a table outside so it didn't matter too much to us how busy it was, especially inside. But I can see how it would be incredibly annoying for people trying to get on and off the dance floor. 

If I could give this review 4.5 stars I would, but I can't. Where I would knock half a star off would be for all the stairs you have to go down when leaving. And also because the stairs are metal and have little holes in them. Even though I was wearing comfortable heels I could walk in, the heel of my shoe got wedged and caught in between the stairs a couple of times. It's just a bit of a rubbish way to end what was a good night that you have to go down a load of stairs. Although once you've gone down them and gotten out of the club it's soon forgotten and it wouldn't put me off returning again as it really is a great club.",2,0,0

Out of XS, Surrender and Hakkasan, Marquee was my favorite venue to go to at night in Las Vegas. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for lanterns at night or that Kaskade is a resident here, but I loved going to this club. Since we arrived relatively late, the main stage was blocked off and we stuck around the outer area, which was understandable.  The dance floors were relatively crowded but that was to be expected. 
After my experience from Hakka-suck, I was very happy to see that there are areas outside where you can actually SIT and enjoy the music. The best part is that there are monitors outside for you to follow along as you sit near the pool and take in the pretty decorations around the area.",5,1,2

Here's why I drastically changed from love to hate (NIGHTCLUB):

1. Hello, millions and millions of lines ... where do I go? Oh, I'm not sure ... but doesn't matter 'cause a bouncer is bound to yell at me and tell me to BACK UP if I want to get in.

2. Ooooo! Insider connection got me to a back line? Oh ... that just means entering through the back in a WORSE line. EVERYONE, LISTEN UP. DO NOT go in the back line - you will hate your life and want to just leave.  If they didn't allow hundreds of hundreds of people through the back, it would be awesome - but for some reason they decide that the back line is not special.  You will be TRAMPLED on when you come near to having your ID checked - why?  Because for some reason, the lines mush together and people start shoving to get in. Took me a good two hours to get in once. Learned my lesson the hard way.

3. Bouncers need to learn that shining a flashlight in my eye while I'm walking THROUGH the dance room is really not doing anything.  Yes, I understand. I cannot go to the dance floor because you blocked it off since it's too crowded. Awesome.

4. My god is this night club CROWDED and the inside part is WAY TOO SMALL. Compared to XS, Marquee is tiny and NOT good for huge crowds. 

If I were reviewing for the night club only, I'd give it one star, but the dayclub is the COMPLETE opposite.  No need for me to go into details because it's literally completely the opposite - WONDERFUL crowds, NOT that crowded (surprisingly), AWESOME DJs, and not a thousand lines and bouncers.  FIVE STARS for the dayclub. Seriously. 

End of the story? Don't bother coming here at night - go here for day club only and you'll want to stay in Vegas forever. 
But I'm rating it as a whole and I have to average it out - 3 stars to you, Marquee.  Do something about the night club, please.",7,2,3

If you like those things, you will love Marquee. I have been twice, once to the day club on a loungy Monday afternoon, and most recently for Sander Van Doorn on a Friday night.

If you like nightclubs, you will love Marquee. If you don't, you will probably not. For world traveling revelers, you will get a very European style clubbing experience on a weekend for top quality DJs.

If you love house, electro-house, and related genres, you will love the Funktion-One sound system booming while confetti rains down.

One major concern: STAIRS. Never a women's best friend especially since you know, we like to wear stilts. 

Lower Level: Top 40s\/hip hop, will get extremely crowded. 
Middle Level: Main room with the headlining DJs of the night. Above&Beyond, multiple thumbs up! The dance floor is fairly small for being the level that caters to the majority of people. This floor opens up into the outdoor area where bottle service and for the people avoiding the crowd. Heat lamps are everywhere, so huddle under one of those on cold nights. Otherwise, once the weather starts warming up, the outdoor area should be amazing.
Top Level: ""The Library."" Bottle Service. Pool table. Balcony overlooking the main floor. Old school hip hop and a mix of current day hip hop. I like this room the best but there's no dancing up here. 

Don't get me started on the line. IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. Don't even think about getting into the club until 2hrs after lining up if you get there later then 10. There are so many lines, I have no idea which ones go to where. Bottle Service line. General Admission line. Guestlist line. Mixed guestlist and general admission line.

Security involves more process and steps than the TSA. We had bottle service so you wait in the table reservation line, and not the long, general admission line that seemed to be wrapped around and stood still for hours. First you get the standard squint from security as they scrutinize your identification involving different angles of holding your ID up, experimenting with multiple lighting, such as using a flashlight. Then you wait for the second roped off section just to get into the club. Once in, you go through a second set of security. This time ladies must hold their purses off to the side of their bodies while the guys have to empty their pockets into a clear glass bowl. Both sexes get wanded and eventually waved through. From there, you wait behind the 3rd rope to get escorted onto the elevator that takes you to the club. 

Not all of the girls in our party made it through security in time (I'm talking to you aggressive pushers and line-skippers!), but the security was kind enough to hold the elevator and expedite the process so we could all go up at once and make our entrance like in the movies (kidding).

We were whisked to our table facing the dance floor and DJ, the house DJ was doing a fine job, spinning some EDM and Top 40s music. DJ Vice came on around 1 am. 

Maquee has dancers above the DJ set much like Light, who kept the energy going. That and along with the cool CO2 blast they'd set off and some light shows.

We loved our comfy booths, and the top of the booth acted as our own private dance area so all the girls could dance the night away without being harassed, it also helped to be behind the rope the entire night.

The only con I'd have to say was that there was only bathroom that we knew of, which was on the total opposite side of the area we were at. So you have to push your way and throw up elbows through hoards of gyrating drunks to go to the bathroom, and repeat on your way back. 

We did pass a cool bar area where there was a dancer in a cage behind the bar.

Overall it was a very lively club, the guy and girl ratio was adequate and the patrons were mostly attractive, age-appropriate club goers.

We got in without any problem (4 girls and 3 guys) and once inside it was just ok until I found out they charged $20 for my whiskey which usually costs me $13 at other clubs.

All in all, its not a bad club but its an overpriced average club. We went to XS the next night which was a lot more fun!

My fellow yelp elites and I had planned a trip to Vegas, and one of them wanted to party. So I knew that I had to hit up my guy. Everything was super last minute, and our party kept getting bigger and bigger. By the end of the night, we were 10 deep. Luckily, my guy took care of business and made magic happened. We didn't have to wait and we got in for free!(normally $20 cover for girls and $45 for guys)

I've never been to Marquee and was very impressed with the venue. 3 levels, main stage was EDM, and on the night we visited, DJ Cedric Gervais was spinning. Upper level is kinda like a library bar with a pool table, and the bottom level is where they played hip hop. Not gonna lie, I appreciate the bottom level the most. Playing all my ""urban"" jams. Because our group got in at around 11pm, there was still room on the dance floor to dance! Imagine that. After 1am, just like any other dance floor at any poppin club, it's pretty much shoulder to shoulder.

Drinks inside are pretty expensive. Belvedere was like $21 each not including tip. Yikes. That cost almost as much as my dinner. But it is what it is. And it's a premier club in Vegas. One should expect super overpriced booze. Once you are inside the club, you get unlimited reentries. And the reentry is located on level 3. Main club entrance is on level 2.

So who's this guy anyway? Ok, just happens that this guy is my good friend. Local Vegas resident. I always hit em up when I'm in Vegas.

I felt like I was literally walking into a movie. I'm not normally into glamour or luxury, but damn if I don't want to stay here the next time I'm in Vegas. I went here a few weekends ago on a Friday night to see W&W. My two girlfriends and I were on the guest list (our two guy friends bought tickets in advance and got inside before us) and probably had to wait around 25 minutes total to get inside. One thing I really didn't prepare for was the walk up the kinda-janky-yet-very-interesting stairs to get to the EDM floor. My friend wore flats that night and I was pretty jealous about an hour in. There aren't many places to sit if you don't have a table or a cabana, so beware. 

The dance floor was super tiny, and it eventually was swollen with people two hours into the night. I was lucky I didn't have a drink because I was shoved around and stepped on until I decided to leave. I couldn't handle it anymore, plus my wedges were killing me. I went outside for a much needed drink and waited about 5 minutes to get served. $14 for my Maker's Mark and ginger. It got more and more packed inside and outside as the night went on. W&W killed it, but we could barely see their set because of the massive swells of people. The lights were awesome and the dancers were getting their hawt thang going! The bathrooms were really nice, and they have everything a woman would ever need for sale at the counters. The interior is super high class and beautiful as well as the outside. The pool is so tempting! I wanted to dunk my feet in a few times. 

I give Marquee Nightclub three stars because when I compared it to my experiences at other Vegas nightclubs, it didn't stand out. I'd definitely come back here again, but maybe next time I'll either bring flats in my bag or come with a crew of girls only to increase our chances of getting invited to a table.",3,1,1

Go onto their website and order the presale tickets and you can enter with little to no wait at all. It is definitely worth spending more time inside, rather than in line outside. You can also check out what DJ's are spinning on which weekend so you can get your tickets early.

When you are an attractive girl it is a lot easier than if you are a guy guys have to wait in line girls have to wait in line to if they look a little sloppy but if you are at 10 and you have at least six girls with you you will get ride in but just remember you're going to pay up big for a table I have never paid for a table in my life I always went with friends that had company cards
Or I would come with groups of girls and just find guys to share their table with them but remember looks are everything and for me I was always able to get in with no problem but if you come to this place now they've gotten a lot less stingy with the looks department because Hakkasan and Omnia opened up afterwards and the last couple of years this used to be my favorite hotel and it used to be very young but as far as the nightclub seeing those and it's not the hottest place in Vegas to go to and it is very very touristy
Turn left have a person that waits online for anything so if you can deal with that then go right ahead but inside is pretty cool

Of course we wanted to go out and have a good time but we did not know what the hot spots were or where they were or how exactly anything worked over there. The only club I had actually heard of and an apparent ""must go"" was TAO, but for some reason I didn't feel like checking it out that night. So indecisive of where to go , I turn on the tv in our room and there's a commercial on Marquee. So we decide to go there just because that was what came on tv and we had never heard of it before. We didn't even know where the Cosmopolitan was since we had been in Vegas for only a few hours! We get a cab and 20 freaking dollars later we arrive! (note to self: don't take cabs in Vegas, they make a 5 minute ride, 20 mins!) 

We arrive at the Cosmopolitan and it's absolutely beautiful inside! We go up the escalators to get in line and to our surprise the line only has about 20 people in it! Weird thing was we didn't hear any music. Even though the line was short, it was standing still. So 30 mins later, the gorilla at the door starts letting people in and when we get to the line he stares at us up and down for like 5 seconds before saying ""alright go ahead have a good time"". Wtf so if he didn't like our clothes we wouldn't get in? Pheeww good thing my bf was wearing a suit and I looked pretty darn nice if I do say so myself!! Lol. 

Anyway....now I know why I couldn't hear music! Cuz u have to take an elevator to get to the actual club! Once off the elevator (ok now u hear the music bumping) you have 3 choices: straight, left or right. We went straight...WOAH!! Crowded, loud, alcohol everywhere...this is Vegas! By this point I lost my bf like 2 times already. Once I find him waaaay back there, we walk to the very back and ohhhh how nice: a pool area. We grab a drink, pay $32 for them, i go into shock cuz that's ridiculous for 2 drinks, and now out of shock we head downstairs and we hear hip hop (yay). Find a spot where we can actually stand (crazy packed!!) and we dance the night away. at one point I couldn't stand my feet anymore so I took off my shoes outside the dance room and a security very nicely said "" sweety you can't have your shoes off here, sorry"" so I put them back just because he said it with a nice smile ;) 

We didn't have a bad experience with anything there, fun times. I took away 2 stars because the bartender automatically tipped herself 2 times and the other because I can only take so much house music before wanting to leave! Hip hop room was fun but too small !",0,1,0

I would highly recommending getting on the guest list buy bring a high girl to guy ratio or buying tickets from the pre sale if you plan on getting into the club otherwise. It will be long wait or risk not getting into the club. The dress code is strict with collar shirt and dress shoes. Bouncers at this club are quick and friendly. I came on a Monday night and Andrew Rayel was playing on the EDM side of the club and there was also hip hop playing at the pool. The size of the club is huge, with a ceiling as high as 3 floors and a lot of LED lighting around the club. Bartenders are quick and are good at multitasking when it comes taking multiple orders from different people. Be very patient, the bartenders remembered what everyone ordered and will get back to you in a timely manner. The prices for a drink are very fair for a club in Vegas. The prices ranged from $17-25 for most cocktails. This club exceeded my expectations and was way better than the clubs I have been to in San Francisco and Downtown Los Angeles.

There were a lot of Asians (me, being one of them as well). But damn, all the guys were short, Asian, and very Asian. 

Before Clubbing: Get on the guestlist! It's hard enough to get in. Luckily we had a contact and he got us free on the guestlist for girls, but fellas always have to pay. $45 each! Poor guys. Get in line early, lines get full at 9:30am already! 

At Clubbing: Expensive drinks, so expensive! Everything is expensive in Vegas, but sometimes they do go over the top. We got in the club at 10pm, and it wasn't packed yet. So that was good. I like how there are 4 floors, the top is the ""lounging""\/library room, 2nd is the ""house music"", 1st is the hip hop, and there's the poolside with seating and heat lamps. The library played the best music. Hip hop floor got full in a second. At around 12-1am, club gets damn PACKED. Like seriously packed that drinks will spill on you and you literally can't walk. 

People were like every other club in Vegas, but I miss admit, Cosmo have better looking people then most other clubs (especially Chateau). But some people were waaay over the top. They thought they were Kim Kardashian or some shit. Thinking they own the place and that everyone should move for them. Ugh, bitches. 

When it got packed, I got annoyed...I think you need to be drunk to enjoy this club, or else you'll be frustrated at 1. how packed it got 2. how expensive it was 3. how the people thought they were celebs 3. how the bouncers were douches

It's nicely done but with a few kinks to improve. The location of the club and the entry lines were a bit confusing:

If you're entering from the ground floor, you have to take the escalator up to the second floor for general admission and table reservations; If you pre-sold tickets, you have to go visit the box office on the ground floor, then go back up on the third floor to get in. There are suits with directional signs indicating where you should go based on the type of arrangement you have (does not help however, when there are thousands of people trying to get in). 

We got there around 11 and got in quickly(thanks J!).  Once you're in the club, you have to climb about 12 flights of stairs in a fire escape-esque hallway (could've at least painted a posh color!). It was miserable as most of us ladies are already in uncomfortable heels. I would say this is the biggest flaw of this club. I understand not putting in elevators (due to capacity issues); but I'm not sure what kept them from putting in a few escalators in this tier 1, multi-million dollar Vegas establishment.

The main dance floor isn't huge but it opens up to the outside area. Big LED screens and tons of attractive people so dress to impress! The outdoor area had tables with tubs (which you are not allowed to use), bars and gambling tables. The bouncers weren't very friendly as they were shoving everyone to ""move it along"" despite it was dead obvious that the place was way too crowded to move at your desirable pace. We did not visit the other two rooms because that means we'd have to brave the stairs again. Not going to happen in 5"" skyhigh Christian Louboutins and I'm pretty sure the in-sole's probably already covered with my blood from the initial climb...Shout out to the lady working the bathroom with those $10 a pair Old Navy flip flops. Genius business decision.

I would only visit Marquee again on a less high-profile weekend. Labor Day weekend was incredibly packed to a point where it was uncomfortable. They also had some sort of strobe light going on which I thought it was going to give me a stroke or something. Should've pulled a Jersey Shore and wore my stunna shades inside!",1,0,0

The ambiance is cool with a bit of an upscale late 20's\/30's type crowd. The best part is that you usually run into some club promoter that puts your name on a list to get in free, which is what we did. They had an open bar for an hour, but I'm not a big drinker (I had water) so I'm not sure if that part was good for other people. The dance floor is a decent size and it's a pretty big club with a lot of room both inside and outside. But once it gets crowded around midnight, you get stuck in one spot because it's so difficult to move through the club. The only downside to this club is that there is absolutely no where to sit down in the club unless you buy a VIP table area ($$$).

Avicii
Kaskade (1 day, 1 night)
Armin Van Buuren
ATB

Let me tell you the major cons I have about this place. 
It is super super packed. It will be extremely hard for you to get around here, with the way this place is laid out. The dance area is in the center, enclosed by this circular area. You cannot even get in there. The security won't let you in at all unless you have a table, or if you bribe them. How lame is that! Depending on the night, the outdoor area can be fully packed as well. 

Now during the day, it can be a bit better. It is not as packed, and you can still get around in the mob even if a good DJ is performing. It's nice because you can chill outside in the sun if you want, or inside if it is too hot. They have couches around the edge of the club where you can chill out, although sometimes the remove them. 

Drinks here are a bit cheaper than other clubs in Vegas. Roughly 15-16 a cocktail, similar to LA clubs. 

Lines are long to get in. I would just buy a presale and go in with barely any wait. I got onto a promoter's guest list, and wasn't even able to get in quickly. I still had to wait in the regular line and pay. Might as well buy a presale.",2,2,1
1171360,HO9BovGc3K4UkGxeiMaZzA,S9zMHMOyCZCmmZW1bgWE-A,WUq8HJHIZU4uteB154XN7w,1,2011-08-16,"Marquee has a strong reputation for being an awesome club and perhaps that reputation is part of the reason why I was disappointed when I went there for many reasons.

First of all, the line up process to get in was ridiculous. We were moved twice into different lines that seemed to have no logic involved in how they were organizing people. There was the supposed guess-list line, which we were in, but the two other lines were moving first. So what's the point of being in the guest list line then? 

Secondly, $45 dollars to get in for the guys and that was the discounted guest-list price to get in. Ok its vegas, I get it ... guys have to pay, but for that price I expect service and not all the vices that I will dictate in this review.

Thirdly, it was so crowded. In fact, it was so crowded that I couldn't dance anywhere. I could barely navigate through the crowd. I felt like if a fire started inside and pandemonium ensued at least 25% of the people would of died or have been injured. And oddly enough I was so uncomfortable that this thought became cynically funny as I stayed longer and longer at Marquee.

Fourthly, and this is for the ladies out there. The club is huge at least three levels. The party that I was with had a number of ladies who's high heels were killing their feet the entire time we were there only to have a bouncer bark at them when they took off their shoes and went barefoot climbing all the stairs. For f@&k sakes, what do you want them to do? It isn't heel friendly, give them a break.

Fifthly, no lie, an employee there intentionally pushed aside one lady in our party stating something like ""I work here, get out of the way,"" as a justification to push her to the floor leaving her potentially to fall down on a floor where there was barely room to walk, let alone dance. Are you crazy? Do you not have a soul? WTF is wrong with you? Oh, I forgot its vegas!

Sixthly, to get out of the club once you get in you have go down at least five long flights of stairs. Which isn't a problem that is until you want to get back into the club and you have to walk back up all those stairs. It's terrible for the women and quickly frankly I was sucking wind going back up as well. They need to come up with a better system for re-entry. Maybe there is no other way, but it was kind of crazy.

Not everything is pure evil. The DJs and music were awesome, but if you can't dance what's the point. And the mermaids in the pool on the top floor were happy to take pictures with the patrons and kept doing it even though no one was tipping them. They deserve tips at least they are making sure everyone was enjoying themselves. The club itself is pretty amazing in terms of design and look, but ultimately if so many small things keep you from having fun what's the point.",7,3,1

Marquee Day\/Night Club and pool was super clean looking.  It's not the biggest pool in town but the cabana's looked nice and even had their own hot tubs right in front.  ANY seating that you might want, you have to pay for.  So you would be looking at about $100-$200 for a typical lounge chair or chaise and everything else is up from there.  The drinks were delicious and the people were really friendly and the service was quick during the daytime (it wasn't very busy though).  There was poker and blackjack going on and the dealers are super nice and want you to win money.  Drinks were $16 a pop but if you gamble they are always free....so gamble!  

Onto the nightclub.  First order of business is dress code.  ALOT of places we went to require some snappy dressing.  Dress shoes for men and heels for women.  My friend was denied for wearing all black nice Nike's so he had to come back with diff shoes.   When we walked in the dance floor was crazy fun and they always had some stuff dropping from the ceiling with crazy lights, confetti and this AWESOME cool air smoke machine.  It felt amazing after dancing and sweating like crazy!  The best part was when a huge platform dropped from the celing and four GORGEOUS women appeared on it.  They were dressed in crazy sexy space suits with lasers, changed to sexy police officers and so on.  They choreograph danced the hearts out and everyone had their eyes glued to them, it was some serious entertainment.  Drinks flowed pretty quickly too but was definitely pricey, as is everywhere else.  

I also left my card at the bar that night.  TOP NOTCH service when I called and asked about it.  They have their own lost and found and it took me 2 minutes to reclaim my card by showing ID.  I actually did this twice that weekend and both times they located it in their data base and told me where to go.",3,3,1

Half of our group (the Vegas regulars) swore by Marquee and decided this was a good first stop for our Vegas trip. 

Upon entering, the club closed off it's other levels and only the ""basement"" was open. It was so small and only two club dancers were performing above the dance floor. It was so crowded on the small space and apparently they let anyone in tonight because I saw woman wearing sweats and sneakers? and guys who look like they just got in from going to the gym or something... really? This type of attire doesn't fly in NYC or nice restaurants. You don't need to be dressed to the 9's, but come on, sneakers are a absolute no no. How can people dress like that to a club? After that shock,  a lot of people, like us, went outside to chill on the balcony. 

To top off this experience, we wanted to order shots but many of the liquors were sold out. We peaced out after 30 minutes even when the guys just paid to get in.

I bought tickets for our group of 4 ladies to go and see Benny Benassi in May. My sister and I have wanted to see him for years and finally, there he was, in Vegas. And hello 'female presale' that meant tickets to get in and for the show were only $20.

We showed up and the lineup system is a mess. Large groups of people are everywhere on the casino floor and it looked like it was going to take us a year to get in. We spoke with a bouncer and said we already had tickets and he directed us up the next set of escalators to the main doors. Without asking, there would have been no instructions on where to go. Organize!

Up we went and joined a tiny lineup around the pool area. The dayclub area is beautiful and we loved the pool and the setup and the view! So nice! Though there were groups of people lying on the daybeds, napping, which probably should have clued us in that we were in for a long night. We waited in line for about 20 minutes before someone came by and asked if we already had tickets. Again, it was a yes and we were put in a line where we were at the front. In we went!

The outdoor bar area is huge and is full of couches and benches to hang out on. There are outdoor bars but the entire area was packed. And a double highball cost me $24. Shudder. So we moved inside and again, there was no where for us to go. Any time we stood still, a bouncer was immediately on us, telling us we couldn't stand there. The dance floor was too packed and when you went on it, you couldn't move. 1:30am rolled around and still no Benny. Just a DJ who was spinning trance shit.

I'm going to make this short and sweet because I had one epic night. 

Came to Marquee Saturday night memorial weekend. Went to the hip hop room saw a ton of fine women. A girl in VIP gave me the ok look to talk to her. So I snuck around the bouncer start talking to her and her friend. It was 8 girls at the table with grey goose and ciroc bottles. Then the turnt-up began. She offer me shoots then lap dances one friend got jealous so she started doing the same thing to me OMG. Next thing you know hooking up, ladies gone wild on me. The bouncer was like you can't be doing that up in here bro. I really wanted to offer him a cup of haterade. Good fuckin night ! 

Tip's
Get your pre sale tickets totally worth it. Go early interact with girls and leave a happy man. I saw a ton of guys with bottle service spending a ton of money $$$ looking bummy. 

Pros
A lot fine women but to me the hip hop room had most of the single girls dancing and interacting with guys compare to the main dance floor. 
Great open view of the Vegas cityscape. 
Overall great crowd.

The real party happens downstairs in the hip hop room.  Definitely bumpin' the best music.  It can also get hella packed.  I overheard a woman yell to her friends, ""What the f**k?  I'm too old for this sh!t."" Ha. But if you're lucky enough to squeeze through the crowd you may just end up partying with the celebrity du jour.  

The venue is massive and navigating between dance floors, bathrooms, and tables can get interesting.  Bouncers are kind of strict; so much so that we were worried we'd get kicked out for the smallest of things.  Ah well.  Still had an awesome night with mah ladies.  Best part of the Marquee experience is the elevator ride to\/from the main floor.  The elevator staff dude entertained us with a little freestyle.  Good times.",0,0,0

We got drinks, expensive and not good. Tasted like cheap vodka. Then we all made our way to the dance floor. 

Security made it hard to hang out if you wanted to take a break. The only place you could stand around and talk with people was outside. They did have heat lamps which were a plus but it was still cold. Security was strict here. 

The dance floor was not that big at all and it was really had to move around. There is a giant screen showing like naked girls dancing, not really interested. I'm not sure how much a table would have been but I definitely suggest it. 

I'm not sure if it was because it was thanksgiving weekend but there were a lot of awkward foreign tourists there. The only thing going for this place is the atmosphere.",0,1,0

I don't flip off anyone unless I find them very rude, so I flipped you off but didn't mean for you to see. I kept apologizing and just wanted to have fun, but you X me out anyway, a tiny, innocent, cute asian girl who was just having fun who was clearly SORRY.

I've been to a lot of the clubs on the strip and thought this one was poorly designed and small. We had to climb quite a few flights of stairs through the fire escape stairwell which was not fun in our six inch heels. You enter in and have to walk through a small walkway in the shape of a half moon. When you get to the middle you're able to exit into a bigger area that lets out to the pool where the day club takes place. When the club gets packed it's a traffic control nightmare. You literally have to push your way through a cramped crowd to get in, out or around to get to the bar, bathrooms, or exit. If you're claustrophobic don't even think of going here. 

    I didn't enjoy the opening DJ's set and that put me off for Kaskade. DJ Lema stuck with the same B.P.M's his whole set which I found boring. I've been to every Insomniac event and listen to countless EDM  podcasts and found his set to lack creative transitions and sampling\/mixing. Even with the awesome screens and visuals it did nothing for me. At one point I thought they changed D.J's because I saw no one managing the laptop or mixing for a good three minutes which lead me to believe his set was pre-recorded. 

    The club itself reminded me of a mini-scale version of XS and I left the main room to go elsewhere before Kaskade came on. On the way out we found the hip-hop room and wish we'd went there first because it was a good time but super crowded.

The only downside to this place is that I always get creeped on often here. I know there are creepers at every club or bar, but for some reason, Marquee really knows how to draw in a lot of them.

Anyway, I was invited to go club at Marquee, prior to its official opening to the general public on 1\/1\/11. Because it's owned by Tao Group, employees of Tao Group & their guests could get in during industry nights. I went on 12\/29\/10 & I was first in line.

I don't know how it will be when it opens, but I was by myself because my three friends hadn't shown up yet. I just stood in the guest list line by myself & chatted with one of the security guards for a long time. He told me I could walk around if I wanted until my party arrived & that he'd let me right back in the very front, no matter how long the line got. Good deal, but I knew my friends would probably be pretty late & I might as well just go in when the club opened. 

Oh, we didn't line up on the first floor where it says ""Marquee;"" the line is actually upstairs, so go up the escalators, & get in the lines up there. After you are let in through the line & get your two stamps, a bouncer will check your ID & point you to the elevators next to him. You'll get in one of three elevators that will take you to the club. These same elevators take you back out of the club - you'll be let off on the second floor again, even though the club entrance & the same elevators are one floor down. I don't know what's up with that. 

Upon entering the club, you're let off in a room with a bar & signs to The Library on your left, The Boom Box to the front right of you, & the main dance floor to your direct right. I went to check out The Boom Box first, which you have to walk down two flights of stairs to get to - good luck if you're drunk. It was only opened for a viewing so there was no music playing. It is a pretty decent sized room with a bar, tables & a dance floor. 

Later during the night, I went to The Library - good luck if your feet hurt or you're drunk, because you have to go up six flights of stairs & a hall way behind the two story main dance floor screen to get to it. There are pool tables & books (only bottle service tables to sit at) & a bar. There's not really any dance floor but there is music playing. There's also a balcony that is covered by sheer panels that overlooks the main dance floor. I was intrigued most by the lighting equipment & the gels they used. (Gels are what you put over theatrical lights to make them look colored, FYI.)

The main dancefloor actually has a smaller dance floor separated by a walkway for overflow - it is sorely needed. Dancefloors are ALWAYS too small in these clubs, which sucks. The overflow dance floor is next to the main bar, & has doors leading out to the outside, which isn't open yet, but is absolutely gorgeous - tons of chaises & heaters. There is a second bar (it is the first bar if you enter the dance floor by entering left out of the elevators - the whole club is a big circle.) The second bar is where you need to head to find the (ugly but large) bathrooms & a lounge area that has FREE SEATING. Yes! Because I was there for a promotional industry night, there was a free photo booth by politeinpublic.com, Moet Chandon & Seven Magazine where our pictures were taken, printed out, & given to us in a press pass necklace. I like free, so... cool.

The main floor music was the same as it is at Tao & Lavo - a little less house music than Lavo, actually. They played Too $hort & E-40 so I was happy. The Library had techno\/house. The crowd was more white than any other club I've been to thus far, which I'm not knocking, it's just a fact. This is of course probably because it was only open to Tao Group. There were a lot of older people there (50-60's.) I'm assuming they're investors with their wives\/mistresses\/hired hoes. Will they be there when it opens, probably not. The rest of the crowd was like Tao's - young people & business men. 

One side comment, I really disliked the videos playing on the two story screen. There was one they kept playing of girls in black underclothes, with white stoic masks in a dark room touching all over each other or walking up stairs, or standing at attention. I'm not buying the avent guard ""art"" BS. I'm more than well versed in political and pop culture symbolism and that immediately stuck out to me as sex slave psychological abuse, especially when I saw the masks. Basically, it's a psychological tool used to make the victim disassociate during a sex act which aids to break down their sense of self during abuse. It's a way to take away an victim's identity so that they're basically just a shell of themself and can be abused further without resistance. I'm not some typical drunk clubber who thinks I'm just looking at art. I know what it is they're showing, and I don't think it's cute.

Good music, interesting design but I don't care to go back.",15,6,9

When you ask people when they like to go to Vegas, they'll usually say during the summertime. I bet it's because they like to go to the day clubs and the nightclubs. Hitting two birds with one stone is always good, right? Although I do like partying in Vegas when it's hot (and the summers there get REALLY hot, like 100+ degrees hot), sometimes I like to enjoy my vacation without feeling like I'm melting. And that is why I like going in January. During the winter, the weather is beautiful. You can wear t-shirt and shorts or dresses and not feel cold at all.

Some of the girls were wondering what we could do if day clubs weren't open in the winter. I didn't mind just drinking and hanging out on the strip. However, my coworker Brian, who is a huge Vegas junkie, told me Marquee had recently opened a festival-style dome day club. This day club installed structural arches with state of the art lighting that covers the whole club. The dome helps control the temperature (around 85 degrees) at the pool so people can get that summer vibe. Clubbers who go at night can also hang out in the insulated pool area.

The day club was so much fun! It was definitely the favorite for a lot of people in the group. :) It sure pays to have friends who are hardcore party people who can tell you all the cool places to check out!

Although I didn't have a beach bod at the time, it was definitely pretty sweet to be able to go to the day club during the winter time. And plus, who doesn't like day drinking?",10,5,4

He performed until 1 AM and we actually thought he was the main DJ. but the main DJ, benassi, came at 1 AM and we only stayed until 1:40 AM. He was horrible. his songs were horrible. We could easily see that everybody else wasn't also enjoying him. anyways I wouldn't go to his show! but frank tempe was great. I don't know if he was famous or not but he has the potential to become a good dj.
The club was horrible itself. We had pre sale tickets and if you didn't have pre sale or you did not have room in the hotel you did not have a chance to get into the club. there was no general admission that night. Although we heard if you really wanted to get in, you could tip the security guys, for about 100$ and then purchase the ticket to get in!!!
The security people were so rude to us. The drinks were so expensive. They even charged for the water. 9$ for a water. The dance floor was too small. and when we wanted to leave the club they didn't allow us to use the elevators and they asked us to  use the stairs!

There was an issue in the line, and the bouncer was incredibly disrespectful, copping an attitude with me! After some back and forth, we were told to speak with the manager. The manager came outside of the club to speak with us, and he was just as rude.

5 things to contemplate while climbing the stairs:

- If God ever gave a sign to stop smoking, this would be it.
- I should drink less. Hundreds of heels clanking on metal echoing endlessly is giving me a headache.
- Why did I come here? Why did I just fork over $60 for this torture?
- Is this how cows feel when they are forced to walk down the metal ramp to be slaughtered?
- Oh I'm finally here! Praise the lord.......wait don't I have to get out of this club the same way?

Must be some kind of sick joke for whomever designed this thing. And just to make you lose even more pounds, they neglect to turn on the AC when you get up to the club. Little to no crowd control, they cram as much people as they can in here and there isn't room anywhere to stand or dance. The venue itself is undeniably gorgeous though. 

The dayclub is much more fun, music is awesome and the party doesn't stop. The downfall is the lack of space (again) and the water is slimy, isn't this place suppose to be new? The waitresses are easy on the eyes, drinks are yummy. Oh, they also let senior citizens party here, and dance on the podium.

After this annoying discovery, I was at least happy to get inside and find a really dope club. This place is huge, and it has an awesome outside area with more bars, another DJ booth and pools.

There was a huge LED screen \/ stage behind the main DJ booth with costumed women dancing around. 

Probably the only downside was the relatively small dance floor. How can you consider yourself a top dance club when there's barely any room to even move around?

Day club:
Virgin alert! This was my first day club ever. What a great way to pop my day club cherry!

So my group had a promoter and ended up at a poolside table. We had two large pitchers of fruity beverages, random smaller pitchers of mojitos and an array of food. I'm not sure if my friend or the promoter ordered the food, but two plates of wraps and chicken skewers with a salad really don't make sense to share amongst a group of 10 girls. We also had a plate of fries but I have strict no fries in bikini policy. The food was fine, but didn't really satisfy anyone's hunger and was hard to eat. But we weren't at a day club for the food, were we? 

I didn't love the music. I'm not sure what to classify it as, but it wasn't electric or top hits. Sometimes a hit or two would sneak into the mix. The poolside set up was pretty sweet so the club was a win in my book. Our group was able to stay together the entire time with the option to hang out at the table or in the pool. It was definitely a party vibe but in retrospect much more laid back versus the other two day clubs I went to that weekend. 

Night club:
Hours and naps later, we made our way back to Marquee. This time we had a poolside Cabana. I didn't love the set up. It was wide versus deep so it was kind of hard to hang out with the group. There weren't enough seats for everyone so some of us had to sit on table area over the mini-fridge. 

Why were we sitting at a club? The only place to stand is a crowded walkway. And the music wasn't really danceable. 

With the setup and music aside, I really liked the ""chill"" vibe to the club. We were hanging poolside at night on a gorgeous roof deck in the middle of Sin City. We didn't last incredibly late because some of the group just didn't like the scene. 

Overall: 
Marquee was fun and had a different vibe. Different strokes for different folks. A 4 star rating for the day club and a 3 star rating for the nightclub. I didn't love the music for either so I'm rounding down to the 3.",3,0,2

Soooo I am directly comparing Marquee Dayclub with Encore Beach, and for me, Encore Beach definitely wins.  The problem with Marquee Dayclub is that the pool just isn't really conducive to meeting people very easily, and there's only 1 pool.  There IS another small pool I guess, but it's in this VIP area and nobody was in it.  I'm sure that in the middle of summer this place is more hopping, but it's the end of April and it was a Sunday, so maybe it was slow for those reasons.  

On the plus side, there were free drinks for girls from 1pm-2pm, so that was nice.  But it didn't include fun drinks, just well drinks... at least they're trying to get chicks drunk.  I did like all of the bartenders though, they are super nice!

The VIP areas they had aren't really that close to the pool, so that was kinda lame.  And the people there just weren't as hot as I was expecting.  I think I'm just being picky, plus my past experiences at Encore Beach were just better than here.  Overall I wouldn't say don't go....but I would say to try Encore Beach first.... (sorry Marquee, get some more hot guys into your club!)",0,0,0

There's a boatload of stuff going on in Marquee. In terms of Houstonian comparisons: the poolside ambiance from Monnalisa, the electro\/house action of Red Door, the swankiness of a place like Manor, and the occasional d-baggery of a place like Ei8ht. There's really nothing quite like it.

Overall, it was an enjoyable if costly experience, and something I'm glad to have done once but will probably never actively try to do again. Here's our night in a nutshell, for those doing similar planning.

Bottle service for a table of 8 guys was a 3 bottle minimum, with bottles around $500. Add in tax, gratuity and extra drinks and we hit 2 grand easy.

The sales rep strongly recommended getting there by 10:30. There's a separate line for table service, but that apparently gets long too. Also, tables are taken as parties come unless you've got that special pull. Our sales rep called back the morning of the day of, which I thought was respectable.

Half our party arrived a little before 10:30, and we waited for a few stragglers. No issues getting in, and the name-check \/ deposit process was actually quite easy. Getting to our table was an experience straight out of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion, as we went into an elevator and navigated a couple hallways and stairs. I'm frankly surprised we didn't end up in some plush, movable black seats ready to become ghost hunters.

The club was plenty packed as we made our way to our table, which ended up being outside by the pool area. I assume the in-room tables are more prized, but I liked the outdoor atmosphere, far enough away from the music to hear each other talk and cool enough to feel the breeze. Yes, I'm sure I sound like an old fogey.

We toured the area at various times. I think I made it to two different floors, but judging from the reviews I don't think I ever ventured to the third venue. The pool is situated just outside the House room, and we also stumbled upon the Top 40 room as well. Poolside was honestly my favorite location in the club, for the old fogey reasons mentioned above.

No complaints at all about the service, which was efficient and well-done. Our hostess came around enough times to ensure we were sufficiently stocked and having a good time. A manager also stopped by to check on us at some point in the night.

Hmm, what else? Dress is fancy, obviously. Club stayed packed the entire time we were there (til 3-ish). There are gambling tables set up in the club for the addicts. Dance floors looked small, but apparently some big name DJs play here. Really close to Secret Pizza which is straight money.",4,4,4

There are plusses to this place. We were on the guest list and yes even guys got in for free before 10:30. At this point there was no wait to get in. I also appreciated the signs out front that tell you where to go for what line. Girls also got a wristband for open bar until 11. Open bar meant well drinks, but they used 10 Cane for their well rum. Wow. Love 10 Cane. There was never more than a minute wait at the bar. I went to the one near the hallway to the restrooms and all three bartenders there were very nice.

Even the security guys were nice! Many of them even chatty! Lots of reviewers said the bouncers were all very rude but I guess since we were there early they didn't get in a sour mood yet being around a bunch of obnoxious drunk people. I know I'd get annoyed too.

Now the minuses. The dance floor is ridiculously small. We didn't even attempt to dance. The outside area is large, but the pool is laughable. I can't imagine there being a dayclub at that tiny thing. Is the real pool hidden somewhere?

The huge minus is when you exit, you have to walk down about four flights of metal stairs that are probably the real fire escape. Talk about weird. Drunk people in heels walking down four flights of metal stairs? I'm surprised I haven't heard of anyone suing!",3,3,2

Went to Marquee 9\/1\/13 for Benny Benassi and Tritonal. Arrived here around 11pm and luckily had bought pre-sale tickets, the wait was around 20-30 mins. I noticed the lines resemble the Disneyland queues were you get in a line to go to another line etc. To go to Main Floor you take up an elevator you have to wait for. 

Walking in was visually stunning, this place is HUGE (Except the Dance Floor) The main floor is surrounded by tables and more tables. If you want to chill and talk you should go outside were there is more room to stand. The views are very nice. Make sure you check out BOOMBOX (Hip Hop Room) usually less crowded. 

Overall had a good time, the lights shows and confetti were awesome, although not as awesome as Hakkasan.

Reason for four stars is that the Dance floor gets soo packed  the security cards will not let you in (Without a tip) Which is pretty annoying. It would be cool if they had the music louder outside by the big screen. 

I would definitely come back here. Drinks were Vegas average. Kept coming back to a bartender named MATT in the outside patio, because his drinks were LEGIT!",1,0,1

Come on.. for a club trying to attract beautiful girls (& the guys who are going to spend cash money to spend time with them) its not the smartest idea to have flights of stairs necessary to get anywhere in the club. 

This club is one of the larger, but many people might not know because of the confusing layout. 

The main room has some of the best Electronic and House artists regularly. The problem is that sometimes the music can get a little boring if you are trying to dance, but that doesn't really matter because when someone popular is performing, you are sandwiched between strangers and have no room to move and dance anyway. 

The pool area is great to get a fresh of fresh air, and some much needed personal space. The lighting and waterfall are lovely, and great for ladies looking for photo ops!

Their staff, however, are totally terrible and very unprofessional. I was in line waiting to go inside, then one of the staff approached me and took away my milkshake drink, saying that to not allowed in the club. He did not even give me the option to step off the line and finish my drink, and I was at the very back of the line.

Originally we had planned to go to XS which we felt was a safe bet and would have been slightly cheaper but it turned out that one my friend's girlfriend was gonna be there with her gfs and that would not have made it a good time.  Why would we want to go to Vegas and hang out with someone's gf while were on a bachelor party?  So XS was out and we considered Tryst because it would have been cheaper than Marquee but we heard that Tryst were all the rejects from XS and Marquee.  Its a bachelor party so we decided we'd do things right and go to the hot spot.  Okay so on to my review. 

Wow talk about an awesome club.  Great crowd and cool layout.  I've been coming to vegas for about a decade and this club exceeded my expectations. 

If you come earlier you might be able to get a better table location.  I would recommend a table in the outdoor patio area, halfway between the bar and the dance area where there's a lot of foot traffic.  The tables on the side aren't as good because no one goes there.

We walked into the club at around 10:30pm and it was already packed.  Get there early, even if you are getting a table.    The club opens at 9pm which may sound too early to go but you really should start heading over at the time and be outside of the club at 9:30pm.  It is that insane.

If you're coming with a group of guys I highly recommend getting a table with bottle service because it will make your experience much better.  Prices for liquor were not cheap.  A 750ml bottle of Belvedere\/Grey Goose\/Patron was $495 and Red Bulls were $7\/can.  Also they have a minimum bar tab that you need to meet which fluctuates depending on the how popular that night\/weekend is. This can range from as low as $1500 to as high as $4000 depending on how large your group is and whether or not you have a hook-up. For the night we went, the minimum table price was at $3000 but we managed to get a table for $2000 minimum instead (this gets you about 4 bottles).  Plus tax and 20% tip. A general rule is that you can bring 3 guys in for each bottle. All in you can expect to spend between $350 to $500 per guy.  If you know the right people and are willing to give the host (not the bouncer) $300 to $500 up front everything will be a lot easier.  Is it worth it?  I'd say yes but your experience may vary.

The VIP bottle service comes with mixers (cranberry juice, tonic water, etc) but VOSS water is $6 each.  You get introduced to a security guard who watches over your area but will also tell you to wake up your friends if they start sleeping on the couch.  WTF guys, seriously?  Why would you come to vegas, spend all this money, drink yourself out within 2 hours of entering just to sleep at the club?  Anyway.  Also, you get your own server who helps you pour drinks if you'd like.

So after finally experiencing what it's like to roll like a VIP, I don't think I can do regular entry ($50 for guys on Saturdays) anymore.  Waiting at the bar to buy drinks and walking around aimlessly with no place to sit is just not appealing anymore. Sure you might *only* spend $150 and have a decent time ($50 entry and 4 to 5 drinks) but theres a reason why bottle service is so expensive.  You are paying for the experience and it's definitely worth it.",3,0,0

Hip Hop upstairs (WISH IT WAS BIGGER, OR a bit LESS CRACKIN? hah)  from this room is access to the side balcony w\/ view of Aria to catch a breather and air.  They also have music out there and a mini bar closer to the bottle service spots.

Room with Pool Table and very old school style looking.. it has a clock that you will see thats similar to the clock tower in Back to the Future =P, VERY COOL AREA!  seemed like underground hip hop & a mix up... maybe it was just the dj that night. (same floor as Hip Hop joint and balcony access)

The Library: main room trance house - Biggest Room with sick lighting effects and screens galore... this room also leads out towards...

The Outdoor pool main where theres a waterfall to the right of the main outside bar - some what mixed, but for the most part House 
umm k, thats all i remember...

For the Bottle Service Peeps - I think the best setups are at the outside main pool area on the sides, Not the center(gets way to crowded and peeps will be all around your spot).  if your near a jacuzzi or against the walls... You are good....

A promoter we met up with made sure we didn't have to wait in a line. He took us through to the back entrance. I will say that it is the most official club as far as gaining entry into I've seen. It seems like each promoter had their own line to put people in, then the ID checkers are pretty legit, then you get a stamp after.

This club has 4 different stories. Each level has something different to offer. The very top has what's called ""The Library"" it's just a bunch of pool tables & it's the quietest of all the levels in my opinion.

The 3rd floor was my FAVE! & where we spent most of our night. We got a free booth right by the DJ & got a free Patron shot. Since it was a Party Rock theme since the guy from LMFAO was making an appearance there were glowsticks provided at our booth, as well as glasses & foam fingers.

Was here for memorial and 4th of july weekend. Loved the multiple rooms. I spent most of the time in the hip hop room but also spent some time in the main room. Enjoyed both but I gotta give it to the DJ's in the hip hop room. Their selection is probably the best in vegas, None of that only hip hop tracks you hear on the radio stuff, but hot tracks you'd normally only hear on satellite radio, mixtapes, or cd's.  The hip hop room dosent get jumping until around midnight though.

The main room is incredible with the DJ perched high up top and a pretty kickass light show. 

I like that you have access to the outside pool area which is their dayclub in the afternoons. It has fantastic views of the strip and hotels. A must see! Great place to go if you need a breather, cigarette, etc.

If you're a guy and have no bottle service buying an online presale ticket is a must. The lines for general admission looked ridiculously long the 2 times I went. I kinda felt sorry for em. Oh well, I love using their presale tickets. They make you feel like a VIP for the price of regular admission. No lines, you got right up the escalators, thru the dayclub, and you're in. From the time I checked in to get my presale ticket to the time i got inside the club doors was 10 minutes if that, I kid you not.

Very popular nightclub with a good crowd and great EDM music (as well as a hip hop\/top 40 area too). The legit DJs however make it so that guys have to pay a significant amount of moneys to get in w\/o hook-ups - $50 ticket cover for my guy friends in our group. But Krewella was amazing. Probably one of the best dance seshes that night. THE LAZERSSS! We were also right up against the DJ, not too hard to get up there before midnight which is cool, well aside from the crazy amount of stairs there are...

Drinks were quite intense - $80 for a round I paid for about 5 drinks...given they are legit, but $15 for a red bull vodka?

- DJ lineup is usually pretty impressive and has big names
- Bathrooms aren't too crowded and are well maintained by the staff; there is a large parlor area in the girls bathroom

Cons
- Small dance floor; most of the time the dance floor is blocked off because it is overpacked so the security guard tells you to go somewhere else to dance

Once in the club, we escorted to the main dance floor and comped 6 bottles of champagne, for bottle service. I guess it helps to have hot girlfriends who were partying it up Sin City style. Being comped, from what I've read, is pretty standard when you're a group of girls. But, it still felt pretty awesome to get that many bottles for free.

What happens inbetween the start of drinking and before I got separated from the group, shall remain unsaid....

After losing my friends (accidentally!!), trying to find my way out of the club became an adventure in itself. Try four inch heels, three ass pats, a couple of dances later and, eventually, making it down a whole lotta stairways to get out of the club, in one piece.

When I eventually found my way out of the club (so many stairs! WTF?), I saw half the party noshing on pizza and the other half with the bachelorette who was saying, ""Where's Rianne? Oh, my gosh! We lost Rianne! Rianne never gets lost!""

A lotta bachelor party people were out this night. Music was groove-worthy and different from just the top hits but it was techno-ish and not my ultimate preference; but still, it was all right to dance to. Female dancers in their typical get-ups were scattered in niches across various walls and about 4 dancers were on stage-most had decent bodies and normal lookin' faces. Place was packed. Once indoors, a nice, tall, broad-shouldered gentlemen split the seas of people and kindly escorted us to the restroom. A bartender we encountered was cold - bad night?, hating dealing w\/ alcohol-induced people, perhaps?  

We waited in the 'other hotel guests' line to get in. Terrible. The bouncer, too, gave us an attitude way below chilly. Waited an hour, from midnight to 1am. While the night was fun, I don't think it was worth the wait. Waiting to get in is just boring, and it was a $20 cover charge. It is a spacious place, though, with a spacious interior connecting to the outdoor area. It seems the way to get in quickly into packed night clubs in Vegas is to know or make acquaintances with a club promoter, which is how we got into Club XS on Saturday night. It is the promoters' job to promote their clubs or whatever they are promoting, and this way you can help avoid a needless, tedious wait.",4,0,0

This time I got to stay for the whole night (past 4:30am) and it was so much fun!! I got to walk around and explore a bit more. There's a DJ in the back of the pools that I don't remember seeing before. Also the main floor had burlesque dancers performing above the DJ (markus shulz on a sat night), but not sure if that's a regular thing now. They were entertaining nevertheless. 
Tip: If you want to dance on the main floor, you can squeeze yourself in to the front of the DJ booth cuz there's actually dance space!! The front side corners have the most dance space. I love it. And they burst cold air in at random times--quite a chilling surprise!! If you're lucky, you can get a foam light up stick to wave around. They also did a lot of confetti drops throughout the night...the only annoying thing at the end of the night was trying to peel it all off your heels. All in all, I like it better now.

A month or so before we were to arrive in Vegas we already knew that we were coming to Marquee on the Friday night so I contacted a promoter to request that he put myself and 4 girls from our group on the guest list. The rest of our party (10, mostly guys) were getting a table (approx. $600 a bottle x 3) in the Library.

We got to the club around 10:45pm and found that there was already a line both for the general admission and for the tables.  Surprisingly the guest list line was short and within 10 minutes we were in. Cover was $50 for me but the women were free. As the rest of our group was still waiting in the table line we explored the patio area of the club. Wow! The night before we were at Surrender but this was even better. Cozy outdoor booths with jacuzzi's, lots of greenery and seating, space to walk!, and a good number of bars as well.  They even had a few poker tables setup!  All in all a great vibe.

After about 20 minute our table was let in and we met them in the Library. Smallish space but classy and not overcrowded.  The music was just loud enough that you could dance to but also carry a conversation.  The table in the Library turned out to be a blessing in disguise because later on in the night when we ventured back to the patio and the main floor it was packed!! Bouncers were at every turn directing the herds of people and getting from the main area to the patio was a nightmare.  We did attempt to dance on the main floor but it was so packed that I thought I was going to be crushed. It was like front row at Lollapalooza all over again. After escaping the dance floor and EDM  we were happy to have the table in the Library to sit down and relax at.

The drinks we bought at the bar were strong and as I found out over the length of the trip is the norm in Vegas. The bartender just kept pouring!

At about 3am we got a pleasant surprise when our table server advised us that we could move to one of the booths on the main dance floor. Yes! We walked with her as she led us to a table right on the dance floor! The table next to us was popping humongous bottles of Dom Pérignon. This is Vegas.

This table was awesome as we had some private space to dance. Great way to end the night.

As we exited the club around 4am we did find Secret Pizza but as the line was so long we decided not to wait.",2,0,0

I understand it's a new club and that Kaskade was performing that night and I didn't have a ticket and was in the general admission line.  

I got there about 9pm and the line was fairly long as I expected.  There was also a line for invited guests\/VIP and also a separate line for people who bought tickets before the event.  

When I went into line some people were I talked to were telling me they were waiting downstairs for over an hour before someone from the hotel or club told them the actual line was upstairs on the 2nd floor.  Luckily I wasn't one of those people.  But I did end up waiting in line for 5 hours and I had to leave at 2am since my friends wanted to head home and they weren't with me to try and attend the event.  Anyways.  When I did finally leave I was about 5 feet away from the front.  I noticed that there was still people in the ""Ticket"" line and it was longer than the general admission line at that point.  I felt sad for those who payed already and they were still waiting in line at 2am to get in still.  I really hope they don't treat their future guests this way.

Just make sure you come in really early if you want to get in this club unless you're an invited guest.  And make sure your on the 2nd floor and not the first cuz they may make you wait an hour or two before anyone tells you your on the wrong floor.",6,1,0

By the way my friends ""wrong shoes"" were $300 Gucci dress shoes that had laces.  I guess laces on dress shoe indicate a dress code violation.

The layout is absolutely the worst ever.  The architect must have been a professional stair climber because all I remember about the stupid club was walking up and down stairs all night. 

Exiting the club was so ridiculous.  First off you have to walk down a crap load of stairs after a hard night of drinking.  Once at the bottom of the stairs you end up in butt fuck Egypt somewhere outside of the hotel and you are forced to take an elevator up to the main level.

THIS PLACE GIVES ME A HEADACHE
There are like freakin' 4 separate lines, how the f are you suppose to know which line you're suppose to get into. Even the staff are confused, they sent my friends on a wild goose chase and had them going up and down the stairs. 

THE STAIRS OF DEATH
When we walked in, we walked in to find that we have to walk up 3+ flights of stairs!! DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO WALK UP THAT MANY FLIGHTS OF STAIRS IN 5.5 INCH HEELS???? When we got to the top, we were ALL out of breath and my calves were on fire (it was worse than the stair master)!! 

SWEAT DRIPPING EVERYWHERE
The first floor we went to was the ever so tiny hip hop room, be prepared to have people wipe their sweat all over you because there isn't ANY room to dance. It was almost impossible to maneuver your way around the dance floor, you either had your elbows in somebody's ribs or somebody else's elbows were jabbed into your ribs. Also since that room is so freakin' tiny, it's hot as shit in there and you know what that means..EVERYONE IS DRIPPING WITH SWEAT. And what do they do when they walk by you with their sweaty asses, they wipe it all over your skin and clothes. GREAT THANKS! I wish they had a bigger hip hop room because that was just ridiculous, if not pitiful. 

UNCE UNCE UNCE
The house music area\/ floor was a lot bigger and is outdoors and wasn't nearly as painful as walking through the hip hop room, thank God because I was irritated at that point. What does more room mean? It means there was more room to dance but not a lot of people were,  most people were just standing around and I believe we were the only group of people who were actually dancing (and I don't really like house music too much).

I purchased presale tickets for Kaskade on August 18th and I paid $80 for them. Two weeks before the event they were as low as $60 online, so if your Vegas trip is planned, you would do yourself a favor to buy tickets. General admission was $100 and that is likely the case every Saturday night. If you are in general admission line after 9:30 pm, good luck. In my experience, about 20-$40 per person will get you past the line in Vegas. Just put it in their hand, nothing unusual about it. I really have no idea how much would be safe bet to grease with at Marquee. The horror stories about the prices of drinks in Vegas are infamous. I tipped our bartender $5 or more on the first 2 rounds of drinks and from that point on, he hooked us up with both very strong drinks and 2 rounds on him. This was my experience on Saturday night and on Monday night as well. Take care of them and they will do the same. As someone who absolutely loves clubbing, there is nothing more amazing than seeing a jam-packed dancefloor at 10 PM. It sucks if you would like to dance and go back to the bar for more drinks, however I cannot be mad. Everybody wants the experience that is Marquee. If you would love to experience the floor on a Saturday night, good luck after 11 pm. I don't recall the floor ever being closed on Monday, however it was still really crowded.
If I could take a half of star off my review, it would definitely be the attitude of the bouncers. I firmly believe it it is intentional and by design because the Cosmopolitan staff could not be more polite but you would be hard pressed to find a friendly bouncer. Even if you are polite as can be, when you speak to them, they respond bland. I got thrown out of the club at some point during Kaskade's set and In their defense, I could have been doing something really stupid that I really do not remember. On Monday night, the bartender said to me that I couldn't have done anything too rude and that mostly people get thrown out for acting drunk. I realize they most likely want to get as many people as possible into the venue and throwing people out for minor drunk acts, is their excuse. That is unfortunate.
Aside from that, I had an incredible time at the venue both nights. The outside area is incredibly beautiful and the view as well. I never made it to either the hip-hop room or the third floor because house is my thing. I love the little boutique shop as well and $40 for the t-shirt I bought is not too outrageous. There of course has to be blackjack tables but why not sit down at a $10 table in in a club, it is Vegas.

Pros:  Large open layout (especially topside pool area), plenty of places to sit or lean if you need to take a load off or just hold yourself upright.  The drinks were great and the bar tenders were hot as hell.  What impressed me is that she remembered my first drink and was able to make another without me saying a word, just raising a finger ""1 more please"".  A couple Tokyo Teas (strongest I have had yet) and that set me up for the rest of the night.    

As previously mentioned in another review the top inside dance floor was armed with every type of club life atmosphere you can imagine.  Lights, big screen, confetti, smoke, bubbles, you name it..it all was there.

The view of the city is great.  If you are not a local, you definitely have take some pics!

Cons:  For live performances (REDFOO\/DJ CHUCKIE) the dance floor was packed.  Once Party Rock really got going the crowds kept pushing up to the access of the dance floor but then the cross traffic was just creating a grid lock.  Finally the club staff got wise and started closing off certain sections of the room to control traffic.  Since when do you need to be ON the dance floor to dance...get over it people.

Probably a CON for most people:  Lines, lines, stamps, lines, stamps, and more lines.  We got there at 9 and decided to eat real quick at Holsteins just outside.   There was no line at the time and they were still setting up the barricades for crowd control.  By the time we finished dinner it was 9:45 and the lines were well formed.   Between guest list, table reservations, ladies only, re-entry, you name it, there was a line for it.   We were in general admission (since pre-sale was sold out) so of course it was the slowest.  We finally got on the elevator and into the club by 11:30.  If you weren't in line by 1030 at the latest, forget it. I highly recommend being IN LINE by 9 if you are just doing General Admission.      

Marquee takes the Girl\/Guy ratio seriously and they will move groups of ladies ahead of the line to balance things out.  It is a big deal for these clubs and most people don't get it.  I would much rather be in a club filled with tons of ladies then a bunch of dudes.  

The overall layout of the club is a bit of a maze..  I stuck to the top area mostly, but briefly walking around the rest of the club was a challenge (especially after having a few).  I really didn't pay too much attention to the other dance floors below.

Dress code is typical...  However, there were plenty of fools in the club with t-shirts torn jeans (money talks).

After hitting Pure on Friday, The Joint for Tiesto on Saturday, Gallary on Sunday....   Marquee is on top of my list.  I still need to hit XS, TAO, and VooDoo.

I could have given this review a 3 but I was so impressed by how the top side (open air) pool area merged with the inside of the club I gave it a 4.

We bought our tickets weeks in advance as we knew we'd be attending, and got in no problem. However, I should mention we got there early - 10. But with no girls in our group I was real happy we still got in very quickly. (If we had not bought our tickets in advance, we would have been forced to go into a massive line, but thats the case with any good Vegas club)

Anyways, this place was packed with beautiful girls, my twin literally could not believe it, and the ratio was great. Kaskade was unreal. Best show I've seen ANYWHERE, and he played for around 4 hours. 

What made me want to really leave a review for this place however, was the service that we were treated with by the bouncers and everyone working the event in general. My brother ended up losing his wallet, and we informed a bouncer later in the night, he was real kind and gave us the lost and found business card of the club. We called it in the morning, and they had the wallet. Huge break for my brother, and nothing was missing. 

Anyways, great club, they have the worlds best DJ there, and the staff is great, you should probably go",0,0,0

We didn't have to wait long to get in and once we entered the club it was very overwhelming. There were so many places to go and there were tons of people, which made it hard to move. 
I finally located my friends table and as I was making my way to their table I felt someone grab me up by my arm so aggressively that I nearly fell over. He pulled me a foot away from the table that I was trying to get to and looked at me and said ""get out of here"". I looked up and saw that it was one of the security guards that worked in the club. I was completely shocked considering he worked there and everyone I meet in Vegas is so sweet no matter the situation. 
I eventually had to have my friend come and get me and bring me back to the table. The only good thing about that night was that Kaskade was spinning and thats nothing special considering you can find him at Encore Beach Club, where they don't get physical with you. The Encore and Wynn are the greatest hotels in Vegas and nothing like what happened at Marquee would ever happen at one of those hotels.

Let me preface this review by saying that I get pretty annoyed when I read a Yelp review that claims a place has ""the best pizza in the world!"" or ""best burgers in the universe!"". A claim like that means that out of every single place on the planet that you've sampled that type of food, this one particular place is a clear cut #1. It just seems that people throw such a claim around way too easily.

With this in mind, I can say that in my limited worldview (having visited places like Hong Kong, Miami, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and of course NYC), Marquee Monday was the single best nightclub experience I've ever had - bar none. The music, the lighting, the people, the views - everything was top notch, and this is a must stop if you're in Vegas.

Arrival

We had a party of 5 dudes, so we already knew that we would have issues getting in. We decided to split ourselves into a group of 3 and a group of 2 to make it easier to pass the line. Unfortunately, apparently we can't follow directions, and we started talking to each other on line near the front. The bouncer saw us and told us that we'd have to buy a bottle. Damn it.

Undeterred, we left the line, and decided to split up into two groups of 2, and I would try my luck solo. My friends went back on line in about 5 mins and they got in with no problem. I killed some time in the casino downstairs, came back, and also got on line with no problem. As an added bonus, I befriended a group of girls waiting to get in, and they let me tag along on their list so I got in with no cover. Sweet!

Inside:

As you get off the elevator, you can appreciate how huge the club is. There's a small bar near the elevator that you can use to replenish yourself, but most of the action is in the inside room. A semicircle with tables and couches surround a large dance floor, with a huge stage up on the front with dancers, flashing lights, and the DJ booth. The dancefloor was packed, but everyone was shaking, moving and otherwise having an awesome time. There's also a downstairs bar section with a smaller dance area, more tables\/couches, and different music.

Music on the main floor was mostly a mix of rap and electronic. The night we were there, Chuckie was DJing and he had a great set. The downstairs bar area was mostly straight hip hop and reggae. It was pretty good to be able to move freely between the areas and sample some of the vibe from each.

Outside:

Like Tao, Marquee has a really great outdoor area with more music, more bars, more girls, and a great view of the Vegas night. If you need to regroup from the pandemonium inside, it's great to just chill and have a drink outside. 

Overall:

Marquee was probably the highlight of my last trip to Vegas. Definitely one of the best nightclubs you'll ever go to, and it's no wonder why it sits at #1 as the highest grossing club in the world. 

Pros: 

Awesome scene
Hot chicks
Great mix of music

Cons:

I paid $35 for my ticket to get in and was pretty damn excited to go. A friend very close to me was celebrating her birthday there. What happened next really upset me. 

I'm in line after pulling my ticket up to be scanned and the guy, who I assume is a bouncer, let's a bunch of us in. He then comes up to me and is looking at me up and down. I ask what's up and he proceeds to tell me he needs to find out if I can get in with what I'm wearing. He said it looks like lingerie and this club is business casual. He goes to get someone else and they both come to check out my outfit. After a few moments he said it was ok and I could go in. 

1- I called the club earlier that day and the lady said "" guys can't wear tennis shoes and they need a collared shirt. Jeans can't have holes on them. Women is pretty much anything goes just again no tennis shoes."" So what was the problem with my thigh high socks and garter? Doesn't sound like it's breaking any rules. 

2-the fact that this dude was looking up and down and then got someone else to check me out was fucking uncomfortable and took a little too long for my liking. I have no problem with checking me out but this was embarrassing when I didn't see them say anything else to anyone about what they were wearing. 

3-my friend had the same damn garters and socks on as I did. No one said anything to her. She didn't get stopped at all. She's by no means thin but she IS thinner than me. If we are wearing the same thing and you have a problem with only my attire, what do I assume? That you just didn't like how my body looked in it. 

4-THE COCKTAIL SERVERS WEAR LINGERIE. They were garters and thigh highs and super short lacy dresses. I'm not knocking it cu it's cute as hell but come on.

5-lastly, I counted at least 20 people with tennis shoes on, saw some hokey jeans and a TON of dudes in tshirts. I also saw girls with short ass dresses and some with sheer tops where you can almost see their nipples. And let me tell you...they all looked fierce and fly as fuck. No hate! But come on now...what is wrong with what I wore? Nothing. Also, don't come at me with some whack ass excuse that the club attire is business casual. 

My general point is you need to hold all of your standards to EVERYONE in the club. There was no reason my outfit was inappropriate. All I can assume is that you didn't like my fat body wearing what I was. Does it sound like I'm jumping to conclusions? Good. I hope Marquee sees this post and realizes that they need to work on their door people and enforce their policies throughout. 

I felt put on the spot y'all. Not in a good way either. I never get embarrassed but the whole situation could have been handled better. Way to go Marquee. I'm not planning on going back and I'm sharing my story with everyone. I'm not looking for a free table or a corporate pre written apology. I'm just giving back some of the shame I felt tonight at your establishment. So have fun with that.

But before I go all hater, let's explore the pros: I waited in line for less than 10 minutes and got in free. Yay. But it's Vegas, and being a woman, this is pretty standard. The Cosmopolitan itself is a nice hotel, and Marquee had a nice layout, with three floors and decent 'atmosphere.' On this particular night, ladies drank for free til midnight, I think, which is always nice. And the music in the hip hop room was great!

And now... onto the cons: For starters, THE STAIRS. Ho-ly crap, I should've packed sneakers in my clutch, cause upon leaving the line to enter the club we were climbing stairs for what seemed like AGES, and in 4-inch heels, that is a killer!! From one set of stairs to the next to the next - seriously? By the time we got to the first floor I felt like I'd just spent 20 minutes on a Stairmaster. The drinks, while free, were nasty. WAY too strong; the bartender must've used an eyedropper to add the coke to my rum. But perhaps they want everyone to get buzzed quickly, I don't know.

The hip hop room was JAM packed. I go to the club to dance, but how can you dance when the room is so full you can't even lift your arm without jabbing someone in the side? It was literally impossible to move. Given that, everyone trying to move through the crowd was pushing and shoving, it was literally a hot mess. The largest floor played all that techno\/trance\/house crap, music with no lyrics and a relentlessly annoying beat that made me feel like I was trying to dance inside a crack-addicts head. Who LISTENS to that? And how do you DANCE to it? No really... someone please tell me, cause I really don't know. 

I can see the appeal of Marquee for some people, truly. From the looks of things, the drunk 21-26 year olds LOVE this place, so good for them. For me though, this just wasn't the place to be. There were women and men who were clearly older than me who seemed to be having a decent time, standing around drinking. So maybe it's not my age, maybe it's just me. I just know when I go to club, I go to dance, and when I don't get to do that, I don't have a good time. So sorry Marquee - just 2 stars from me.",3,3,2

Marquee is located in the absolutely gorgeous Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino. Everything about this hotel is fabulous and just screams Vegas!

We met a promoter a couple nights before and he got us on the guestlist (thanks Danny!) and we had no problems getting in. Definitely get on a guestlist because this place was super crowded around 10-10:30! 

Marquee has multiple floors with different rooms and music but we stayed on the main floor for Kaskade. It's such a beautiful club and a very close second to my favorite, XS. The pool area is amazing at night! There are tons of cabanas and VIP tables outside as well as inside. Drink prices were pretty standard however I didn't drink too much because once you left the main DJ area, it was hard to get back in since it was so crowded. 

The one thing I didn't like about Marquee was the stairs! WHY are there so many!?! My 5-inch heels could not handle it but thankfully I brought some TOMS to give my feet a break. Ladies, do yourself a favor and wear flats, sandals, or wedges...your feet will thank you later, trust me!

The long of it:
Marquee is my favorite club in Vegas right now. It's so different from the other clubs in Vegas which is quite refreshing. There's different levels to this club, and three different rooms (main room is house, boombox room is hip hop, and a library room with R&B and old school). They have a resident DJ Kakade that plays at least once a month (you must go on this night!). You get a mixed bag of people here and  I've always had a great time whenever I come here. As much as I like this club there are also cons, like the excessive amount of stairs, dance floor gets too crowded, main room gets hot like a sauna. One interesting thing that they have here where I haven't seen anywhere else is that the bathroom lady sells flip flops for $10 (for those of you who can no longer walk in your heels).",3,2,2

So you have been going out in your hometown. You have hit all of the clubs and feel you are ready for the big time. You head to Vegas and you want THE Vegas clubbing experience. You  want to go big or go home. Well here it is. You really ready for this? Marquee is a classic staple of Vegas for years and its setup is probably what you imagine when you think of world class Vegas Clubbing. Only a few clubs can boast the sheer size and variety of Marquee. It's right up there with Pure and Surrender and Drais on scale. Don't get me wrong you will still be crowded and pushing on the dancefloor but that is really every club in Vegas. When we went the bouncer said there were 6,000 people signed up for the guest list for a Saturday night. Just to give you a feel for what its like. That was with a major DJ performing but even if its half of that on a typical Saturday night you are in for an incredible time. 

The diversity and number of people just add to the once in a lifetime party feel which is what you are looking for in Vegas. There are so many rooms and so many themes and ways to get away from the crowd that you really can't ask for more in a nightclub. If dancefloor sweating is not your thing there is an incredible outside seating area near the pool where the day parties are hosted. There are bars and music out there so you could stand and talk to strangers till your hearts content without ever having to step on the dancefloor. If techno is your thing the largest and main dancefloor is huge with an array of lasers and tricks to make you feel like you are in the middle of a Tiesto or Aoki concert which you very well could be. There will be streamers and foam falling down constantly. The only issue is it usually turns into a performance so people are really dancing as much as jumping up and down to the DJ but if that's your idea of fun then they have it here. Looking for a drink? Go to the more than 5 bars located in this establishment. Really once you get up through the elevators you are surrounded by fun from people to drinks to music that it can get overwhelming in a good way. 

The best part of Marquee for me of course is there is a separate room and area for HIP HOP. YES. We were able to pull of the amazing feat of finding Hip Hop at five different clubs in five days and Marquee was the premier behind Tao for us. The Hip hop room is located downstairs in a basement type setup. Once you get downstairs there is a small bar which can get crowded then there is a small dancefloor with a DJ behind the bar. Behind this setup is a circle of VIP. Really if you are going to have a good time you should be down in this basement sweating profusely and dancing to the best hip hop in Vegas. Tao has amazing DJS but there set we heard here was one of a kind (Sorry 1oak). They played hip hop from every region of the country, underground stuff, pop hip hop, 90s and 00's stuff and the latest hits that you may not have even heard before. We never wanted to leave this dancefloor. It is the most crowded from about 11pm to 1am when it is almost impossible to move and people pushing. But you have to embrace it and get in there because it is worth it. After those times it starts to space out as people commit to the main dancefloor upstairs and you have a couple more hours to dance to your hearts content. If you are with a large group of people it's going to be hard to stay together but once again you gotta accept some sacrifices for music this good. 

It's the combination of all of these factors that make Marquee a five star option in Vegas. This is what you tell people about when you say you went clubbing in Vegas. It's something your friends can't imagine unless they have been to Vegas before. The amount of attractive people, the space, the variety of music, the amount of drinks and the layout is just one of the best on the strip and you would be doing yourself and anyone you are with a disservice if you at least try to get into Marquee one of your weekend nights.",0,0,0

EDM music inside. Hip Hop outside.

We came here over the weekend for Cosmic Gate. It was a great performance. 

We just hated the fact that it was extremely crowded in the dance floor.
Of course, we expect that all Vegas clubs are more directed towards bottle service, therefore, the VIP tables took up most of the space. Its just so unfortunate that the dance floor is so tiny and compacted with people who are inconsiderate of personal space. So beware, you will be bumped and possibly hit in the head or get your foot stepped on. 

At least the bars aren't over crowded and it's a lot easier to buy a drink than it is at any clubs in San Diego.

The outdoor part of the club outside is beautiful. Big open skies, tons of space to walk around. Plentiful of tables and pools. But it was also lame that the DJ played all the most basic hip hop songs you hear at every other regular club. They need more originality for the most part.

Is the spot where you can experience being pushed over and yelled by security. Go upstairs by taking the stairs if you want to go to the Library or BoomBox. See a fight in every corner and I even saw a guy getting his teeth knocked out by a drunk ass bastard. Security kicking out girls because they decide to sit down on the edge of the stairs rail. Bottle Service is a complete mess, with pricing and service. I am a local and let me tell you something, Marquee was good on their first 4-6months. Hospitality and service is the worst that I've ever experienced. When my friends come to town I tell them go anywhere besides MARQUEE! COMMON MARQUEE book more DJ's stop booking the same ones. Get out of your COMFORT ZONE! Train your freaking staff, expand your marketing team and stop digging your own grave!!!",6,4,0

- it has an outdoor pool
- there is a large outdoor area to take in fresh air and try to talk to people... try. 
- It attracts all the top DJ's who perform quite a lot: ATB, Kaskade, Madeon, Benny Benassi, LMFAO, to name a few. If there is a desert tour for top DJ's you'd be sure that some will definitely play at Marquee because it's the place to be. So just save the ""ugh Marquee is so overrated"" and go to the club if you're into that music scene. 
- I got in for free because my group had a contact, so that probably made up for a lot of the pain that other people complain about

I want to complain about:
- worse than usual crowd control. I was literally in a can of sardines. 
- smallest main dance floor ever for such amazing DJ's. WHY??? Only table service around it too. My friend and I were pushed by bouncers to keep walking even though I just wanted my few minutes of ATB. So lame. 
- the bathroom. As per usual... girls really suck.

This club is the opposite of spaciousness. I mean it's standard, when you consider the amount of attention and people that this club receives. But they really need to fix something about the occupancy in comparison to square feet.

This club is about 3 or 4 stories, with each floor being somewhat limited. There's normally a hip hop floor, outdoor floor, and a main floor(which primarily plays EDM).

The line can get ridiculously long. So I suggest an early arrival and to get a stamp so you can go in and out. Guys are normally $50 - $80 depending on the performing DJ.   I also suggest that you buy a ticket so that you can cut the majority of the line and so that you can pay in advanced and reserve a small spot for yourself in the club. During the night I came, it seemed as if the guy to girl ratio in the club was about 5:1 if not, even more. And there were so many creepy old guys there, trying to pick up young and fresh girls. Sad to see....

One thing I'll truly rave about Marquee is the professional security. This is a component that I HARDLY approve of but wow Marquee's security was nice, at least to me. Despite even making us wait extra periods of time, they courteously apologized to my group for the long delay and that they will accommodate us as efficiently as possible. And even inside the club, they were nice. Normally, they only allow girls into the main dance floor(when it gets packed) but when I asked if I can go in, they let me! Wow! Even when I have a penis, they let me in! Talk about feeling special and proof that Vegas may not be all that sexist. I hope the douchebag security guards at Surrender reads this and learns something from it. 

Overall, a decent experience. For once, there was professional security that treated me like a human rather than a farm animal and that really made me believe that not all security are assholes(nor hate me). Not enough spaciousness and major improvement needed in gender ratio.",1,0,0

Door guys are surprisingly nice, girls are nice and actually hot even the girlfriend agrees lol(not butter faces like most clubs).

My bad, I can't walk because the place is far over the capacity but I get scolded because I'm a decent human being and I won't shove my way through? Whatever.

We went both for the Above & Beyond concert (trance fanatics) as well as Friday night to just dance and get in a blur. The main pits were crazy busy and everyone stepped on your toes, but everyone was just in the dance state, so it was an amazing experience. Friday night we finally found a separate little dance floor with a lot of room, and just had a magical time dancing away in our world. Saturday night (the A&B concert) was super packed, but we ended up near a railing, and near a bouncer, which was nice since they moved along the people, in front of us, but we were safe.

Of course, Vegas always has something to offer in a lil' city. Great minds think alike when the words of: pool party, vegas, house music, and a combo of inebriated drunkards basking in the sun while sipping on endless amount of booze come into play!

Marquee is deemed to be THE spot to pool party. However, I think Encore and WET Republic take the cake. Here are my gripes:

Small pool to splash around and sparse accommodations to any of your belongings, yet alone, leave it with a large pile of other people's belongings. Hence, bottle service gives you a small space to party like a rockstar with your friends and soon-to-be friends and leave your stuff hanging around. The service is baffling!! My friend orders us bottle service and pitchers of more alcohol to go around with our group, but to our own dismay, the little monster shuffling her small frame and fake boobs in our faces was utterly rude! She wanted us to pay first before we got our drinks?! WOW!! My friend paid for everything, called his credit card company to cancel the transaction, voila!, we got our FREE booze in hand!! Boo-yah!

The crowd was so-so. I've seen better eye candy at Encore and WR. A group of guys tried their best to fondle me and my girlfriends thinking I wouldn't say one word. I NEVER take that kind of advantage from ANYBODY! Security was shamefully nonchalant about the incident and scurried off thinking it was no big deal. Really?! After much avoidance and drinking plenty of vodka shots and AMFs, I was dancing like nuts to the filtering sounds of house music!

I really want to give this place more than what it should be credited for but I find it disappointing when I receive lack of service from anybody. I enjoyed the hours of incredible music, my awesome set of company, and what was little to be known, an okay venue. Is it worth it to come back again? Depends. If they held any of my favorite house DJs, I'll be back or someone holds their birthday\/bachelorette party here.",5,3,2

Whenever I'm in Vegas, Marquee night is always the best night of all... except for that one time... ANYWAYS, pretty huge venue and very elegant. I've been to two dance floors and the really pretty outdoor area. The Boombox is for you hip hopsters. A smaller dance floor compared to the main but it's pretty fun and chill. The main floor gets crazy by 11PM. Get ready to push and shove your way through while you hold onto your friends' for dear life. 

They play house music mostly but once a month they have Party Rock Monday. This is my favorite Monday of all Mondays. If I didn't have a 9-5 job, I'd be at Party Rock Monday every month. If you don't know, Party Rock Monday is a LMFAO hosted party. It's crazy with neon colors, zebra prints, and wigglers. ""There's no party like Party Rock Monday.""

1) Cool vibe - everyone I met came to just have fun, smiles all around. dimes. dimes everywhere.

2) Dance floor is popping - if you like to get wild, then it's all good. it get's packed, if you dont like that then go outside and kick it by the pool area (there's tv's all around to show you whats happening inside on the stage) or the areas on the side.

They will stop people from coming onto the dance floor if its too crowded. Solution? 1) buy a bottle or make friends w someone at a table 2) slip him some money 3) be a really good looking girl

3) Production - LASERS. LASERS EVERYWHERE. I dont even think swedish house mafia sets blast that much laser. screen's are all sync'd well and gogo dancers make you do a double take. if you are into productions and that sort of stuff the lighting guys are actually at the very back of the club near the pool bar. they are more than willing to talk shop if you are interested. 

P.S: they also blast confetti everywhere and at some point had the bubble machine turned on too (yo dawg i aint try to get random soap on my hair so chill with that) SENSORY OVERLOAD.

4) Staff - was most impressed by how well the staff was working. have enough friends that run\/work nightclubs to understand how much effort it actually takes. for a better glimpse check out the GQ article that came out featuring marquee. used a promoters gl and got comped drink tix also - protip: always make sure you make some new friends that work in the industry ;) a simple hi how are you doing goes a long way. I'm not sure who is responsible for hiring the talent but keep up the good work my dude ;)

5) Music - probably the most important part. they book plenty of good EDM acts, and the resident DJ's are also pretty sick. I feel like my hypem playlist had most of the same tracks they played (thats a good thing). 

6) A lot of people ask which is better, XS or Marquee? They each have their own strong points. I'd say they are kings in their own leagues. Go to both =)

Even though it was crowded and took forevers to get in i figured since we are there already and it would be good to check out a new place.  We go in and they took us to our ""table"" at the library.  At the library it was way to small to have pool tables there.  The people shooting people barely had any room adn we kept having to avoid the pool sticks every time they had to shoot.  

So, we decided to finish our bottle and then walk to another room.  Well, the next room we went to, not sure which one it was, but it was really dark and sooo crowded.  So crowded, i'm not sure how people who were in the middle would ever get out or even move.  I couldn't handle this place anymore that i just HAD to leave! Well, we arounded up the girls and started leaving.  In order to leave this place you have to walk down all the flights of stairs.  Very painful.  These stairs are metal and reminds me of a fire exit or warehouse stairs.  Even if your feet were not hurting it would hurt by this point.  We all felt like the stairs was endless.  Finally we got out of this place and i felt so relieved that we were still alive going through this.  We left and went to XS.

I went for the first time back in March and couldn't remember a thing. Then I went back over Memorial Day Weekend to see Markus Schulz, albeit with very high expectations. Overall, wasn't that impressed. 

First of all, it is INSANELY confusing to get into this club. First floor, second, third, fourth? Where do you start? It is so confusing. Whatever happened to ONE entrance and ONE exit? The other not-so-helping aspect about this already confusing club is that the bouncers\/security people aren't all on the same page. They all tell you different things, sending you on a wild goose chase to find the mystical entrance. We eventually got in, so yay, but I definitely lost my buzz in the process.

The outside of the club is really cool. It's set up around a pool and there are pretty lights everywhere. The inside... it's regular. The pictures you see on the website don't resemble the inside at all in terms of lighting. It's all black\/dark, I really didn't see anything special about the ""main floor"" at all. There's a huge screen in front of you, but it's really nothing spectacular. Also, the main dance floor area has been described to me multiple times as a ""mosh pit of dancing dudes."" This couldn't have been more true. 

The funny part is that when you leave, they make you all take the same elevators down to the exit. Oh, so NOW there's one way to exit, but really?? You're going to make thousands of people take the same way out... via elevator?

I don't like big, loud, douchey nightclubs, and it would be stupid for me to write bad reviews on other ones I've been to (I won't be writing one on Haze at the Aria, which I was also at on this debaucheries LV weekend) when it's the entire scene in general that's not up my ally. It's like giving a bad review to an Italian restaurant when you don't like Italian food in the first place. 

Anyways, if you like nightclubs and wanna go to one in Vegas, I'd make this my choice. It's HUGE, beautiful, and has a completely different vibe in different rooms\/floors so there's something for everyone. Honestly, I know there's a lot more to this place that I didn't get to check out, but what I saw I liked. The pool area was gorgeous and there was lots of room to sit & mingle w\/friends. I'm not a big fan of electronic music, but this area was huge as well. Later in the night (well...early morning) I checked out the hip-hop area and adjacent patio, which was also a lot of fun. 

I can talk about lines, cover charges, rude bouncers (which I didn't experience here...stand-offish, yes...but not ""rude""), but at the end of the day that's the Vegas club scene so you probably already know that if you're bothering to read this review. Plus, everyone has a different experience when dealing w\/promoters (if you go that route) so the logistics of Marquee is hard to comment on. I will say the drinks are expensive in general, but on par w\/Vegas standards (as far as in night clubs). Of course you can always sneak a flask in (who, me?). 

At the end of the day, Marquee is a nice nightclub and if you're gonna do the club scene in Vegas I would recommend it. If you absolutely detest this whole scene, however, I don't think this place is necessarily gonna make you convert so I'd definitely come prepared to deal w\/douchebags. Just have an open mind I guess :)",1,1,2

It's located inside the beautiful Cosmopolitan which is in the smack middle of the strip. They have a pretty good list of DJ residency so I am sure you will have fun here.
Marquee entrance is located on the 3rd floor but your group may have to go to a different floor depending if you're on the guestlist or not.
I suggest for your group to take a group photo in front of the beautiful Cosmo chandeliers before you enter the club! Then after there are a variety of restaurants, snack bars, and bars after you leave the club. I suggest Secret Pizza or Egg Slut. 
Nightclub: The Marquee bouncers are extremely good at crowd control so you won't get pushed and shoved around as much as you'd experience in other nightclubs. This also means that if you leave the dance floor, you may not be guaranteed to come back and join your friends- unless if you're a girl with a few other girls.  I love the outside patio area which has a huge led screen so you can see the dance floor. What I love about Marquee is that they have some outdoor seating! They also have gambling tables outside if you're feeling lucky. 
The table services are great here and you have a great view of the DJ from pretty much any table, which is a huge plus. 

Dayclub: Marquee Dayclub is in the same spot as the nightclub but it's all outside in the patio area. I love this day club during the summer because you can stand in the bar area right behind the DJ! It's a pretty small day club with plenty of bars and bathrooms. I would recommend for you to bring your waterproof phone case because everyone splashes the pool water when the beat drops.",4,5,5

I'm not a real big clubber, I prefer going to bars with excellent mixology programs and where I don't have to stand in line for two hours and drink crappy, expensive drinks  BUT we were at the Cosmopolitan, it was 2 a.m. and the birthday girl wanted to party. I was relieved t see there was no line PLUS I didn't have to pay because I am a Vegas local. 

Anyway, I had read on Seven magazine that there is this area in the club called the Library where the head of Tao's beverage program had created a special cocktail menu since the Library was supposed to have more of a lounge feeling. So we stumbled across it finally and I headed to the bar thinking I'd peruse the menu to see what their house creations were (mind you, I had just been at Herbs and Rye and the Vesper bar downstairs) and the bartender told me they only had bottle service. So I asked him what he had. He pointed to the bar and told me they had everything. So I asked for a bramble, a mint julep, a negroni and he told me they didn't have any of those cocktails. So I went with a gin and pineapple juice for FIFTEEN DOLLARS! WHAT!? I can get a delicious hand-crafted cocktail for $12 bucks at the Chandelier bar!

After getting over this shock, we headed to the dance floor. I had a good time, stayed until close. Probably won't be coming back since a club really isn't my scene.",1,1,1

As a result of missing the guest list, my friend dragged us upstairs through a whole bunch of people ( which made them really mad) I was just amused, because if you had gotten there earlier then there would have been nothing to complain about. 

We ended up getting in about 20 minutes after our friend talked to his promoter friend.  So it didn't really take that long at all !!!! 

It was 45$ for guys with 2 girls, girls for free, I'm not sure how much it would be normally though.
This place was so confusing since there are a few different ways to get in, so if you get here early around 945 or 10 then you should be fine.
There were many stairs to walk up to get into the club, which is kind of a bitch if you are in heels. 

Martin Solveig played that night, and the dj before played house music as well.

The dance floor was way too crowded, and they didn't let anyone, so we had to sneak in ok I know you are not supposed to do that either. ahaha 

The outside area where the pool was was so nice and pretty !!! It could have been larger though. 

2 shots of patron and a coke were $30, I think the rest of the drinks were around $15 - $17. 

But we had free drink coupons, so not that bad :) 

I don't think I would come again because there was barely any room to dance, and the whole club just seemed to crowded and small.",1,1,1

(I think that's what it was). When we arrived it was packed! It started at 2pm and we got there around 3:20. We walked around for a bit, stopped at the bar with our 2 tickets for free drinks. I had a margarita and she had a lemon and vodka type drink.  

Then we got SO lucky! She found someone she knew who escorted us to a table under the tent. Someone else came over and asked what we'd like to eat. They sent over a tray of fresh  fruit while we were ordering food and drinks. ( I really like it when I'm treated like a high-roller). They offered us a bottle, but I was driving and going to Embers that night, I only wanted a mojito. My friend wanted one too so they send over a carafe of mojito's. 

For food we had:  Ahi tuna over salad. The salad had cold blanched snow peas. WOW, insanely delicious. Next time I see them, I'm buying them and putting them in salads. WOOOOOW.
There were cherry tomatoes, avocado and artichokes in the salad too. The dressing was very good as well. We also had the fish tacos'. They were delicious too. We had a side of fries to and they were nicely seasoned. 

For drink: Margarita and mojito. The mojito was definitely better than the 'rita. I dont like the fake syrupy stuff. They didn't use fresh squeezed (key ingredient!) lime juice. Cheap tequila. No Grand Marnier floater like a really good 'rita has. The mojitio was better, and it did have fresh mint, but it was only OK. I guess we should have gotten the bottle!

The Scene: lots of scantily clad early 20's pretty girls taking orders and bringing drinks. They have male runners bring the food. Lots of people, in their mid 20's to early 30's drinking. A LOT. Since most of these are friends and family and employee's I'm sure this was toned down. A DJ playing good music. A table full of good food and drink. Me likey!

I wish we would have gotten there a little sooner and wish I could have stayed a little later. It was cool. DJ playing music, tons and tons of people walking around drinking. On one hand I did feel a little old, on the other, if I didnt work that day and have to work the next, I'd probably be, no, I *would* be one of the tons of drunk people. Instead, I went to Embers and had a FANTASTIC time at the elite event. 

I wish I could say I'd come back here. But I wont. Why? It's crazy expensive. We didn't pay to get in, or for the 1 free drink we each got. BUT the high roller cool sh*t we got came with a ""bill"" but it was ""comped"". For ONE carafe of mojito, 1 ahi tuna salad, 1 side of fries and 1 order of fish taco's the bill came to $149.00! They was no table charge, and I dont think I saw a fruit platter charge, and we didn't pay to get in OR those drinks, so, this would have been, what, a $300+ day if we had truly paid for each and every thing. Getting all that stuff was great, I loved it, and I'm thankful for it. I just would not spend my own money on that.

I have been to multiple clubs on the strip, plenty of times. On two different occasions I have been in a group where we have had our phones stolen on the dance floor. This has never happened to my me or my group of friends, anywhere else. The first occasion it was one girl and out of her purse. The second time THREE of us got our phones stolen on the dance floor (zipped inside purse pocket, front pocket of jeans, inside bra). Let me also mention that we were all sober. Within the half hour it took for us to cancel our phones, they had made calls to Colombia and switched my SIM card into 2 different phones. They were professional phone bandits! Watch your phones, guys! 
Besides that.... Marquee has two stages. In the summer, there is the main EDM stage inside and a hip-hop stage outside. In the winter the outside portion closes off and the Boombox room, with hip-hop, opens up. The Boombox room is always packed, however the bar is easier to get to than the upstairs bar. The outdoor poker tables stay open even in the winter!

Located inside the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas, Marquee has been one of the stand out clubs to grace the Sin City.  Lights, drinks, pools, dancing, and a good time are what you'll find in Marquee.

We went around 10pm on a Friday night.  Luckily we ordered bottle service because tickets were sold out for tonight's event (Gareth Emery was playing).  Bottle service was about $2500+.  We had about 15 of us, so we all split the bill.  

The place was half way packed.  There were a few people dancing on the floor, people walking around outside and inside, and people just chilling at their tables.  The bars inside and outside displayed the various liquors they had; the dance floor was a little small, but everyone made it a habit to dance on everything during the night; the sound systems sounded crisp, and you could hear every single laser beam and fart in the room; and the outside patio was vast and felt like a whole new world to explore and get lost (and possibly drown in the gigantic pool).

And what's Marquee without seeing a few celebrities?  We saw freakin' Neil Patrick Harris making out with his sexy husband.  Oh man, Doogie Howser was eating his face like it was the last supper.  I also got to shake his hand.  Til' this day, I haven't watched my hand.  Now there's green bubbles and mushrooms growing on it.  Oh yeah, my friend went to the bathroom to relieve himself.  As he was urinating, he looked to his side and saw FLAVA FLAVVVVVV!!  YEAH, BOY!!!!  From what he said, Flava Flav was tilting all over the place and his bodyguards needed to help him stand up.  

Marquee-- always guarantees a great time.  Seeing celebrities, dancing with hot chicks, shooting down liver-pounding drinks; it's like I died and went to hell.  Thanks, Marquee!!!!",0,3,1

One of my local friend took us there and we went straight up  to VIP without the wait.  If I have to compare this to XS Club, I would have to say the pool area is not as big and fancy as XS.  The only downfall is the hip hop room.  It was either too crowded or too many people was there that night.  We could not bare less then 10 minutes.

It is also being run by the Tao Group (who also own Tao and Lavo - in both Vegas and NY) and they know how to run clubs. 

Overall, I think Marquee is a nice club, but sometimes does not live up to the hype. There are 4 different areas you can party\/dance\/hangout\/drink. The main dance floor area is where all of the action is but is overly cramped - way too crowded for me to enjoy myself and so I find myself exploring and hanging out in other areas of the club. There is the Boom Box room where they usually play hip hop and the Library room which is more chill and not so club like. The outside area (which is Marquee Day Club during the day) is usually where I end up (mostly because that is where my table\/cabana has been lately). The vibe is always going on at Marquee and it is always crowded - be sure to go early if you are not getting a table\/bottle service and be prepared to wait. You can get pre-sale tickets online through their website and that is a very good idea especially on long weekends or nights with big name DJs.

The pool parties are also very good and a lot of fun and sometimes I enjoy these more during the summer than actually clubbing. Nevertheless, another great addition to the nightclub scene in Vegas.",2,0,0

Multi-storied club with multiple DJs spinning different types of music.  Very modern and chic. Just take a look at the pictures.

Music:
1) Lower Level - Hip-Hop, club mixes, Old-school Hip-hop as well.

Crowd:

El boliche explota. Está 10 puntos y tenés un sector abierto (el patio) donde pasan mas hip hop , y es más tranqui para charlar y conocer gente. Asi mismo está el sector de adentro, donde toca el Dj, que en nuestro caso fue Porter Robinson. Ahí adentro casi no se puede estar de lo lleno que está, y no bailan es más una onda agitar al Dj de turno.

Recomiendo contratar bottle service, para poder asegurar un lugar donde hacer base y tener una buena cantidad de tragos. Creanme, van a gastar lo mismo que pagando la entrada y pagando las bebidas aparte. Cierra por todos lados si eligen las mesas de afuera (las de adentro son muy caras, y un bardo)

The dance floor was almost as big as the one at Bank but the VIP tables were separated by a path and that seemed to make a difference. The only complaint was the freaking bright lights that they would flash once in awhile. Why do they do that to our retinas? 

It was easy enough to get in but getting out was a different story. There weren't any elevators going down. Instead, you had to walk down multiple flights and once outside, a bouncer would greet you with ""Watch your step"". So you think it's the immediate step and then you look up at the beautiful view of the strip and the pool area and there, a tiny but deadly step that the guy was talking about. I caught it in time but the paramedics were already on the side helping a fallen victim. 

Once you clear that step, you have to walk around the pool area to escalators that take you to the mall level, the floor above when you enter the club. It was great PR on their part to get the guests to do a walking tour of the hotel amenities.

Did we go anywhere else with our broken feet? I don't even remember. Oh wait, we went to Jet.

Getting in:
We were on the guestlist via www.freevegasclubpasses.com
With that, it took maybe a couple of minutes while the guys found our names on the clipboard and got themselves organized. Free.",2,1,2

Simply put, it feels like a different nightclub. 

Right when you walk in, you'll notice the main floor is no longer endless runs of house\/trance. Instead it's a perfect blend of electro, hiphop, & a splash of house. It brings much more flavor to the main floor. 

In doing so, this gets rid of Con#3 on my previous Marquee review in where everyone stares at the DJ and dance like zombies. Instead, the focus is on the dance floor. Much much better. 

Naturally since it's Industry Night, you'll see a lot more locals compared to weekends. A fun twist too since they are always excited & curious to meet ppl outside the city. 

the warehouse stairs r still not fixed in the venue (probably never will be) but hey... their change in Monday Nights is a sure start in the right direction in creating the ultimate nightclub in Las Vegas.",0,0,0

DJ Carnage was on that night and the table min was quoted at $2000 for main room out rim.  This was not my first time at Marquee but first time getting a table there.  I met Andrew at 10pm and was ushered straight in.  I met our host Bryan who walked up to our table.  It was on the outer rim kind of near the bathroom.  I thought it was ok for the price and would fit our group comfortably.  I met our server (Kenna) who took my order.  She tried to push the bigger bottle packages but I stuck with the minimum needed to reach our table min.  Then I left and gambled til about 11:30.  I brought our group back in and was ushered straight to our table.  I was pissed to find about 15 dudes in our area.  Bryan explained that we only had 1\/2 the area.  I met Scott our security and he did his best to try to keep the 15 dudes on their side.  But I could tell that this was not going to work out...So I flagged Bryan and asked to be moved to the next section.  AFter about 15 mins, he got the ok and we were quickly escorted to the new table.  Kenna followed us as did Scott.  Everything was good from that point on.  
My thoughts on the club...It is a decent layout.  IT got pretty damn crowded and the dance floor was def not an option.  The bathrooms were a tad far, but was not crowded.  Service was good and fast.  Music was EDM and was good if you are into that.  The crowd was decent and probably had an avg age of 25-40y\/o.  Good mix of both sexes.

I expect that it's going to be worth my while. This club was insanely difficult...and we didn't even have to wait in line! But even if you're allowed immediate access, there's a line to get onto the elevator that's a little ridiculous. Granted, i understand that this club is brand new...but it was a little much. 
Once you get up there, it's a nightmare to try and navigate your way around there. But they play great music, the go-go dancers are awesome, and the ambience is amazing. So you can deal with the sea of people running into you. 

Now, MY only REAL gripe about this place is their outside bar! And their bartenders. Me and my cousin LITERALLY (we timed it) had to wait 45 minutes for the girl to even acknowledge us! Once she did....SHE FORGOT! She got distracted by some other guy at the end of the bar and we literally had to shout at her and remind her about our drinks. We are not the only people she did this too. I've never been to a nightclub where there were so many people complaining about how it didn't live up to it's hype! Once we got our very simple drinks (and we ordered 2 a piece to avoid having to go back) they were gross. If you're going to do a crappy job at least be heavy on your pour rather than weak. Plus it was quite a task with a clutch and in heels trying to not have hundreds of drunks spill your drinks! 

$60 for weak drinks and over 45 minutes of waiting for those bad drinks definitely took away from the glamour of this place. Other than it being crazy packed and that...it was a very cool nightclub. Would i go back? Ya...but not without a table and bottle service. Otherwise you're going to waste the majority of your night! 

Seriously, for the newest spot in Vegas and considering how nice the hotel is...they need to hire more bartenders and have more than one girl working each well...and preferrably more considerate ones. Then I think everyone would have a better time.",1,0,0

I have been to Marquee SEVERAL times and have never really had a bad experience. Yes, it's crowded, yes, it's expensive and yes you may feel a bit uncomfortable at times...

My recommendation to anyone is to get bottle service, preferably a cabana and just enjoy the hell out of your night. Great times can be had at Marquee, but this comes at an expected cost. Highly recommend either Marquee or XS for and EPIC night out in the city of sin.

I went during my 21st birthday weekend to see Cedric Gervais here, and it was fun but I really shouldn't have worn terribly high heels! We ended up leaving early because we couldn't deal with the squished feeling.

I'm from L.A. and I don't go clubbing all the time, but I have been had my share of exclusive\/hot\/trendy clubs and this one def has the potential but there is WAYYY too much going on. The staff, the 4 flights of stairs, not any stairs, like metal stairs that crunch your feet and toes if you wear heels  (i'm not joking. and girls, wear COMFORTABLE SHOES) The $16 or $17 dollar cocktails (but they don't make them weak, they have a heavy pour) and not being able to sit anywhere, and being sandwhiched between people constantly becuase it is soo packed is not fun for me or my friends. Again, I've been here twice and it as exactly the same both times. Asian people, no seats unless you have a table, and tons of people that isn't for someone that is clausterphobic.

Oooooh this place is amazing! My girls and I partied hard here on a Saturday night and had the BEST time. Gorgeous decor, pretty people, overall a sincerely classy act compared to some of the other clubs on the Strip. 

Three separate rooms - the main room (house), the Boombox (hip hop), and the library...which...shh...we can't talk about ;)  We danced and drank the night away, mainly in the Boombox room, and also chilled out on the balcony that has an amazing view of the strip. DJ was off the hook and outside, the views were breathtaking. The people were good looking and well-dressed -- this is not your 'lower end' club scene with the skeezy sleazies! 

What I love most about Marquee: awesome DJs, multiple bars - we never waited in a line for drinks longer than 5 min., short lines in the bathroom (a godsend for us ladies!), different levels and rooms (for a change of scenery). 

I will say that if you're a guy, expect to pay $40-$45 cover. Marquee is so hot right now and has such crazy lines, that even if you're a girl you might have to pay cover (although...we got in for free, thank god lol).

The stairs lead us into a smaller dance room which we made a complete circle around, only to realize that the only way out was back the way we came.  I'd have to agree with Patrick C. review of, ""too many stairs"".

First and foremost, make sure you call and make reservations for day beds in advance.  If you try to do it at the door, you will most certainly run into a higher table minimum.  We did it at the door, 3 of us with a minimum of 1000, the table next to us did it in advance, 5 of them with a 500 minimum.    If u end up not getting ur own area, then general admission is only 30 bux, but u end up being a douche just standing around, or in the over crowded pool.

One you arrive, the waitress is very nice and accommodating, taking ur initial order.  Then they come back with whatever u got and your minimum bill with tax and tip already added for you to sign.  You can imagine since tip is already added, and you have signed, that service will suck after.  You're right!  The waitress afterwards is literally no where to be found.   We asked 10 different people for things over the course of our time there, service was horrendous. 

The music is pretty amazing.  The people look great and are very friendly, probably bc everyone is dancing and drinking.  The pool gets totally packed.  The water looked NASTY, it had a cloudy appearance to it that made it look very unsanitary.  

It is a fun party, just remember, book in advance and expect the worst service of your life.  The good music and the fun good looking ppl make up for all the bad.",8,2,0

My cousin saw Kaskade here during his crazy set on NYE, he warned me to get bottle service next to the dance floor to make the best of the show, but I figured we could all just eventually get on the dance floor like other clubs, but boy was I freakin' wrong!

First off, we got there around 1030 and got in right away, but the dance floor on the main floor was already ridiculously crowded and wouldn't let people into it already.  You can't stand around anywhere around the border of the main dance floor because all you can do is keep walking.  Outside of those walkways you can't really enjoy anywhere else inside because it isn't the dance floor and the main attraction effects don't even reach that area.  Basically, if you aren't set up for bottle service surrounding the dance floor your night is pretty much shot (unless you like standing around outside just listening to the music and watching the screen of the POV camera set up right behind the DJ)

The crowd that was there that night clearly didn't really know who they were listneing to because most of them seemed to be ignoring the music, and the few that did know the tracks being played or who the main DJ was for the night were outnumbered the vast amount that was just there for the scene.  What was hilarious was the amount of people who would run into our group looking for drugs or asked if we were looking to buy one of the escort girls they were pimpin' out to the random folks in the crowd.  Honestly, that was where I seriously found myself really close to walking out.  If it wasn't for the fact that I really enjoyed Kaskade's set, regardless of where I was standing at any given point of the night (since we were told to consistently keep moving)

The club is separated into three areas, a tiny ass Hip Hop room and a random spot called The Library, which I have no clue what its main purpose is.  Those other spots could be used in a different way since I feel that most people are on the main floor regardless.  Oh, and beware of all the stairs that you have to climb to get to the main club, and other floors.  It's going to be a journey!  However, the stairs are a great test of sobriety for those leaving the club at 4am.  I bet there are tons of photos and experiences of folks falling down them.

It really would take me a ridiculous amount of convincing to come back here and try this place out again, and the only way that would happen is if our squad gets bottle service that night.   However, I definitely would try this spot out as a DayClub, I'm assuming the experiences are different.  However, as a nightclub, this place is freakin' bananas.  The bouncers here I give props to, since they definitely doing their best to do what has to be done amongst all the craziness, but I feel that some of their work can be cut down by letting people go in N out of the dance floor.  Closing the dance floor does not help with the capacity on the floor.  I can easily see someone getting trampled if an emergency just happened to occur (which i hope never does).  

Like I said, I'm down to go back and try this place out with no reservations in the daytime, but at night, its gonna take some convincing.  Until then, the nightclub gets the ending my cousin gave it at the end of the night, ""This Club is Whack!",3,3,1

Benny Benassi was there last night, which was awesome, but it meant that the main floor crowded up pretty quickly. By midnight they weren't letting people onto the main dance floor anymore. But there was still plenty of room to dance, plus the lower hip hop floor, which is my favorite part anyway.

Lets start w\/ the day party - 2 stars - came through on Friday July 4th after we all landed. First the foolishness at the door with the hardcore I.D.'ing and lines to get on lines, even though we were on the guestlists and we're a group of girls. Prejudice from other staff members of our own color, were giving us a hard time and power tripping. Once upstairs the asian bartender was a total turd, we ordered gummi bear shots from her, she misheard and gave us some minty shyt that tasted like scope, she had an attitude problem when we told her it was wrong and we wanted her to change them to what we ordered, as if WE did something wrong, cause its our fault that the music was too loud and she couldn't hear us? Ok, so then she goes and tattle tales on herself to management before we go and speak to them ourselves, cause she wanted to soften her own story by telling it herself and still wanted to charge us to change the shots, cause naturally someone shot it all since they're supposed to be shots. Duh. Anyways, we finally got our correct shots after some back and forth, but it was a total buzz kill to deal with her sourness, especially when the party was already dying down. We had started our day so happy and ready to party, they completely harassed us down to were we just left. Came back again Tuesday to kill time before our flights and it was such a dead zone. Had lobster tacos, they were ok, light, small, nothing too flavorful. Both times they played awful EDM, no house at least, no switching up, no classics, just super niche electronic shyt. Marquee dayclub staff and management is super weak, and you would think they would conduct themselves better with new, hipper, sexier competitors like Drais taking the majority of their crowd.

As for the night club - 4 stars - we had a good time there last year, and a great time there again this year on a monday night after the 4th of july holiday weekend. Got through on the guestlist with no harassment this time. But also worth noting we got there really early, like 10-11ish. Was supposedly their industry night, we stayed in the boombox room with hip hop. Music and mixing was good, everyone was dancing, tons of groups of cool girls ready to have good clean dancey fun. We were some of the first to arrive, some sponsors got us tons of white gummibear shots so we were feeling nice again. Place got packed, music was great, Lebron James was in the building, things got good, cause we forced it up to be so. But originally the girl bartender was super nervous to make our normal drinks properly during the open bar because of ""cameras"". Same with a guy tender at another bar downstairs, and he was of course more rude about it. Management needs to empower and encourage their barstaff to apply discernment independently for situations, 3 hot ladies celebrating a birthday and bachelorette, shouldnt have to negotiate for well made drinks, especially at the given pricepoints. You would get so much more money giving people proper drinks, cause then theyre feeling buzzed and enjoying themselves and want to stay longer and spend more money. Stop being so effing cheap on the liqs and making your staff so scared and bitchy, or if the struggle is so real, dont have an open bar then. And your door shouldnt be armed to the tooth by assholes. They should have the good sense to let the party girls into to party. Lighten up marquee, you're really not that hot and you're losing your audience to other hotter, better staffed and better managed spots on the strip.",5,2,2

While grabbing a delicious meal and a few drinks at Shake N Buns in the Cosmo, I notice a line forming outside. Our bartender informed us that it was the line to the Marquee Nightclub.

With money left to burn, I figured this would be a better option than gambling it all away. So $50 a head and five minutes later, we were in!

I got off at the hip-hop room. A small nostalgically appointed space, but nice. I don't know who that DJ was, but he had a great ear for classic hip hop! 

The library area was really more my style, but it was empty when I made my way up there. Being the uppermost area I witnessed what seemed like scores of high-heeled women wobbling their way down the dimly lit staircase grasping on to the handrail for dear life! Mildly amusing.

The main floor, had some kind of house techno thing going. Again a nice space, however the music there wasn't really my cup of tea.

The outdoor pool area... very very nice and really crowded. Perhaps the best place to get bottle service in my opinion.

After about six Blue Label neats, plus the two Glen 12s and a glass of absinthe earlier all I remember was I managed to spend the whole night there, danced with a group of lovely ladies from San Fran (happy birthday Ms. White Dress whoever you were), met a nice cougar from out east, chatted with Bouncer James at the outdoor stairs leading to the pool area and totally fell in love with my bartender Jennifer who was working the hip-hop room bar (I always get attached to my enablers).

I absolutely enjoyed my night here as we listened to Robbie Riviera spinning, danced, and sipped on drinks next to the beautiful pools and loungey tables outside, and not to mention on the rooftop of the new Cosmopolitan hotel.  There are many bars located at this club, so if one is packed, you can linger around another, inside or outside. I can't emphasize enough how beautiful it was outdoors at night.

The main dance floor was incredibly packed and it was sort of a hassle to actually step foot, and furthermore dance. That was probably the only con, but on Saturday in Vegas.. uh, what's new?
There's a large and mesmerizing LED display background behind the DJ set. And although I didn't really prefer this particular DJ who only played one type of music, I still thoroughly enjoyed the music because the sound quality and atmosphere was great.

Women's bathroom, no line. Amazing? Yes, kinda. But it was crowded in there. There were long couches and vanities where most girls were just lounging around and (drunkenly) chatting up. COOL

-Network with a host..they are easy to find on facebook\/Instagram\/etc. Getting in contact with a host will ensure that you don't have to wait forever in line. Arrange an arrival time before hand, simply text when you arrive and your host will walk you in. BE SURE TO GIVE A PROPER HANDSHAKE..i always gotten great service from Marquee hosts and take care of them.

-Other then that, Cosmo hotel guests get a +1 with room key on Fridays and Mondays. There is a separate line too.

-Best night to go is Marquee Mondays aka their industry night. Alot less hectic to get in, and they are more relax on the dress code. Don't be fooled..Monday parties here are more fun then the weekends. Bottles are marked down greatly ($500 on weekends drop to $350 range)

-Being a tier1 club..it currently has one of the highest table minimums on the Strip. If you want a good deal\/lower minimum, plan on arriving early.

-Hennessy\/Patron are $16 a shot! Visit the outdoor bar for quicker service.",17,1,3

The entire vibe of the place is great and everyone was there to have a good time and party in true Las Vegas fashion.  We went during ""Party Rock Mondays"" in July and was worried because of all the hype surrounding the place, and it def. lived up to the hype.  Never at a nightclub have I received such amazing customer service from everyone working there between the bartenders, waitress', bussers, hosts, etc.  Did not experience any pretentios attitude.  We went in through general admission because we were staying at the cosmo and got in for free.  After walking around the place, which is huge and sort of like a maze (which I saw as a positive and a cool way to go around and see what the club has to offer).  We were out in the dayclub  area and noticed a few empty tables so our group decided to talk to a host and ended up getting set up with a table for the night and had an amazing time.  We had a table outside for NIght Swim at XS the night before and the whole vibe, set up, seating was SO much better at Marquee.  It was also sufficiently cheaper which I was surprised by.  The DJ's in all rooms had the crowd going.  In my opinion, right now Marquee is the club to beat in Las Vegas.",2,0,2

Where: Cosmopolitan

What: Best Club in Town

When: Monday Nights the best or weekend i guess.

Why: Because they have a Boom Box Room that spins Hip Hop and not just ElectrotechnohouseRoboJobo like everywhere else

How:  Get presale tix.  You have to be in shape to walk in this club.  You must drink before you get in. You must look your best and be on your best behavior.

Marquee got the best club layout I've ever been to. I love the way its decorated and looks.  Bartenders Cool, DJ's Cool, Security Buttholes, Drinks too expensive, Layout is awesome!!!",8,4,4

The venue got packed around 1pm, so make sure you get there early to avoid the line. 

The place provides lockers for $30, which is definitely a good deal, since you'll need a place to put your wallet and phone. Trust me, everything gets drenched; it's inevitable. So invest in a locker! Additionally, my friends got their shirts and flip flops jacked, so beware of thieves!!

The music was great, the temperature got hot, and everyone was having a good time. Once Kaskade started playing, water was getting splashed everywhere, so prepare yourself for a wet and wild time.

It was like running into someone you don't much care for who is better than you remember. Smokes less. Not as drunk and obnoxious. Tolerable.

But you still want the experience over immediately.

Such was Vegas, where I returned for my first (and likely only) visit to Marquee.

So much hype. I guess when you live in the best city in the world with two of the best clubs in the world (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/ruby-skye-san-francisco#hrid:ssUu4hCdIIjyHeqILya2JQ and http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/mighty-san-francisco#hrid:6JtZVbPB0HCMop8tzKzIQQ) you're not as easily impressed.

Cool visuals. Plenty of confetti. Good sound. Nice staff. Outside area to lounge.

In other words no better than home. And back home smoking is not allowed, drinks are half the price, the crowd energy is more positive and there isn't some stupid rule requiring guys to wear dress shoes.

Love dress shoes. Just not when dancing. This isn't a wedding.

They had performers and confetti blew out on us. It was pretty sweet. A different variety of people too.

Although, the only negative downfall I would say about this place, is that it was extremely crowded. People were stepping on my feet the whole time and when I woke up the next day, I had bruises on the top of my feet. If you don't like to constantly bump into people, this isn't the place for you.

I mean so many pretty girls and you don't know which one to pick and which one to dance with.  We were on the first floor where they played techno music. I was just going with the flow and started dancing with some fine looking female. I probably danced with 50-60 girls and girls hardly said no to me. I guess it was one of my luckiest day.

They always have great dj's headlining and there are several rooms to dance in. You can seriously get lost with all the stairs and rooms in Marquee! (WARNING: Drunkness will inhibit your sense of direction, especially at Marquee! Be ready to explore...) 

The Library plays old school hip hop and has more of a relaxed vibe. Bottle service tables, fireplace, pool table and a bar. Upstairs from the main floor.

The Boombox is dance\/hip hop mixes, very dark and gets VERY crowded. Has lots of tables inside, and direct access to the outside strip of balcony. Close to the elevators.

Main Stage is pretty small of an area to dance in, but if you go to see a DJ get your spot early! Bouncers close off the ramps once they feel it reaches capacity down there. They have awesome audio\/visuals for DJ sets and one of my favorites is when it gets a little hot they blow puffs of cold air! Exactly what you need to keep your groove going!

Outdoors will play the same music as the DJ on the main stage just no special bells and whistles of course. But other times they have a DJ out there on a mini stage. Depends on the night

And as we all know, it will cost you your first born for a drink in Vegas, no surprise there. Drinks will be no less than $20!!

One thing is a plus is that they will offer free water! Unlike other clubs claim to only carry tiny bottled waters for $8!!! (AHEM, Haze)

ME: I go out.... A LOT. I've been to every major club on the strip and then some. Marquee is as good as it gets. Luxurious, Fun, and the epitome of Las Vegas glitz & glamor.

OVERALL: Marquee is certainly one of the largest clubs. There's the main room where the dj's\/headliners perform, a large outdoor pool area, and a more relaxed upstairs area called the Library. There's a lot of room to move around and there are quiet spots where you can chill and have a conversation.

WHY SHOULD YOU GO ? : This might just be the EDM snob in me, but Marquee always has the best line-up. Armin, Cosmic Gate, Above & Beyond, Aviici, Porter Robinson, the list goes on! You can always expect the best at Marquee.

LINES: The line is slow-moving and packed. If you want in on the weekends, be sure to show up early and have a 1:1 or better ratio of girls to guys.

TIPS: FRI & SAT have a very strict dress code for guys. No Sneakers No Polos. As cheesy as it sounds--dress to impress man.

INDUSTRY: Mondays is Industry Night--Party Rock Mondays! All Locals Free. LMFAO is there every so often to party rock the place. Its basically a mini-rave. Dress however your heart desires!",5,2,2

Word of Kanye, Jay-Z and some other celebs have already ventured through its doors. Suit up, throw some rubbers in your pockets, and prepare for a night of chaos. You may even get lucky by the end of the night.

Where does it begin? The lines to enter that is. Tables, guestlists, VIP, ticket holders, general admission. There are lines everywhere. If you're trying your luck in the regular line, look for the longest. It wraps longer than Dirk Diggler's goods and it is slower than your grandma's driving. Pre partying in line? You better make it quick. The men in black suits will jump on it if they see you boozing in line. Ultimatum given: kill your drink in front of him on the spot or toss it out. BTW, there's not too many trash cans around. Chances are, you're going to litter and the poor girl behind you is going to kick it.

It gets stuffy as hell in the lines. There's absolutely zero ventilation while you're waiting. No fresh air, constant cigarette smoke, booze in your system, and no water is an inevitable disaster waiting to happen. Possibly even a lawsuit. People getting dizzy and light headed, yack is already found on the ground, people slipping in that yack, and NO, you may not leave the lines even if you're about to piss in your pants. Too bad the suits says, leave and try to re-enter where your friends are and you will be asked to go to the end of the line.

When you finally get in, you are ushered into a bunch of elevators like cattle. The door opens and the elevator man yells out, ""WELCOME TO MARQUEE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN."" At this point you don't know it yet, but you've been put into a scientific experiment that you didn't know you signed up for. Ever wonder what rats thought about when they were put into mazes? You will soon find out. No table service you say, good luck hanging onto all your friends. You might as well say good bye because the only time you'll see them again is when you randomly run into them an hour after you lose them. Ladies this is especially true for you because you girls don't carry your cell phones with you & dudes are constantly trying to break up your pack so their chances increases (baiting club chicks 101).

The place is incredibly packed. Shoulder to shoulder, toe to toe. Don't wear your Louboutins because some drunk tard is going to spill their drink and\/or step all over them. Besides, I would recommend comfortable foot wear for men and women. This place houses a billion steps. There are steps EVERYWHERE and you can't access the elevators. By the end of the night, you'll be crying for a $15 Chinese foot massage in Alhambra.

Everyone is dressed to impress. It's like prom but what do you expect from a Vegas club such as this? No one cares about your douchey $300 Ed Hardy sneakers. Throw on some nice leather, even albino aligator skinned kicks, then maybe you won't look like such a fool when the bouncer doesn't deny your entry.

Bars here are a mission. There's 50+ of you for every bartender they have. When you venture for a drink, order an extra drink for yourself. Chances are you won't want to wait another 30 minutes for another drink. Take orders from your friends too, save them the trouble. You might as well take the entire crew up there and whoever gets served first can order for everyone. Don't act appalled when you find out one drink is about $14. You're in Vegas and it's the most happening club right now, not one of your typical hipster Downtown LA dive bars.

Marquee is also a daytime pool hot spot. I think they're going to do very well with that during the summer. It's almost as if they geared their outdoor areas just for that. Cabanas, private jacuzzis, pools, everytthing is top notched, uber grand, and classy.

Music varies depending on the different rooms & which level you're on. The main room started blasting house\/electro at one point while the downstairs smaller room had classic hip-hop\/rap which is more of my forte, ya dig? Every inch of this place was filled with bodies, there's no escaping it except maybe far outside. There's plenty of eye candy as well as that little thing called a ""venereal disease."" So play it safe tonight, actually every night.

Bring your credit cards or a wad of dead US presidents (preferably Benjamin Franklin) because it's going to be an expensive night at Marquee. 

Did I fail to mention that it took forever to get out of this rat trap? Good luck all.",16,19,10

Not super crowded, but it was a Thursday.  

For those who haven't been, this is a really small  pool but it is very beautiful and the service was always excellent.  The grand cabanas have their own private jacuzzi (not heated because not needed), couches, a refrigerator stocked full of tons of non-alcoholic beverages (i.e, redbull, coconut water, water).  Can only imagine what the going rate is, but if your group is big enough or rich enough, it would be worth it.  

Even with the set-up, I still enjoy the Boulevard Pool more.  A few free chairs, some regular folks.  What can I say?  I'm laid back like that.  And Boulevard Pool has shuffleboard!

Cons: Can get crowded pretty quickly, lines start getting long a 9PM, stairs

Wow. Good stuff Cosmopolitan.

XS at the Encore is pretty cool, but this place is cooler. Marquee is the newest club in Vegas and it definitely raised the bar. This place has 3 different rooms. The main room is the biggest room and the DJ plays techno\/house music. In the ""boombox"" room, they play hip hop. In the ""library"" lounge, they were playing old school hip hop and R&B.

What makes this place so cool is the decor.  The main room and the outside pool areas are just as nicely decorated as the rest of the Cosmopolitan.

The drinks here are your typical vegas fare (i.e. $15 bucks), but that's too be expected.

The only downsides are it gets pretty crowded and there are lines at 9PM.  It might just be because this place is new, but we'll see.

Definitely check it out if you're in Vegas.",2,1,2

The DJ set that night was what you'd want if you went to see French. Hip-hop from all the decades and a few surprises here and there. The crowd was chillin and came with a low aggressiveness rate. 

Their outdoor area is so Vegas! It is quite refreshing for when you want that breather after knockin down a few drinks and grind sessions.

The security for this makes getting in pretty time consuming and you have to go through a line before getting into an elevator, after which we needed to go through another line. Good thing our group didn't have to pay to get in here. Sad thing is that a lot of people tried to cut Into our group, so be watchful when you go!

Overall the place looks cool but the main dance floor is small. 

Another heads up if you leave early like we did (aka leaving around 11pm),you have to take the stairs instead of going down the elevator. The elevator is reserved for people going up at that time, 

You end up having to walk down an industrial set of metal stair cases for what feels like 3 to 4 floors. So if you are wearing heals then that will be a bit of a problem. My friend who was wearing heals was having quite the time going down. Luckily there was light at the end of the tunnel and there was a person giving out free marquee branded sandles. Definitely a life saver when my friend saw that. They gave the slippers after we had already walked down 70% of the stairs.

We get a table and bottle service (2-3 bottles) every time we come here for three reasons:  1. You skip the insanely long line outside, and form in a much smaller ""table"" line 2. You get a place to sit down and catch a breather 3. The security keeps people that shouldn't be in your area\/table out, and they escort overly drunk people out as well so they don't ruin your experience.  Heck, for a nominal fee we get a sanctuary in one of the hottest party spots in Vegas?  All  good!

Table service:
It is what you would expect.  Book early, tip well, and you may find yourself ""upgraded"" to a really awesome table inside the main floor.  Or you can opt for ""cheaper"" tables outside in the pool areas, etc.  Be sure to tip the person in charge of security in your area so that you can count on them keeping an eye on your stuff! Be careful with the upgrades though because sometimes they will stick you in a TINY table in a better location.  The last time we went we figured we would try it out, and we had mixed feelings about the super cramped spot.  Much better view and right in the heart of the club, but only 2-3 people could sit at a time of our 5 person group.  We had a 6 person table outside...

Experience:
It is a really safe place.  I have never seen a fight break out there, or anyone too obnoxiously drunk causing trouble.  It is more of a high end hang out spot.  Everything here is extremely overpriced\/expensive so be prepared for that.

been here for day club many times and it has always been a great experience! i prefer day club over night club because i just feel theres much more fun to be had! now ALWAYS get on that guest list. there have been times we scramble to find more girls to even out our ratio and we aim to get to the line latest at noon. don't come later it may be hard to get in if you're on guest list. ALSO some times they allow girls to get a wrist band and get as many free drinks as they want for an hour or so. AMAZING.

this day club has many different pools and table sections as well as a bunch of different bars open. they have lockers downstairs and upstairs. i recommend waiting til you get into the actual day club to get a locker so you don't have to wait in line to get back in. also bathrooms have plenty of stalls and are gorgeous!

ALSO i commend the staff here because we came once and there was a storm the morning of and i called and they let me know if it continues to storm they will not cancel and will instead open the indoor nightclub area as well as outside. made for hell of an experience! my only complaint is often the djs come out super late in the day rather than when everyone is there! but hey this is my favorite day club if you can get over how grimy the pool is... but its vegas... lots of grime everywhere!",4,2,5

First of all, this place is FILTHY. We walked in and the whole place smelled like urine and drunken desperation. We had a cabana and the little carpet inside was sticky under our feet. The daybed attached to our cabana was lined with towels but they were all stanky and full of questionable stains. Like, seriously? A $1500 cabana and the staff can't change the towels on the day bed? And I cannot convey enough how disgusting the pool was. The water was thick and soupy with random floating debris and hair floating everywhere. It looked like it hadn't been properly cleaned in a month. I stepped in up to my shins and it was at that point I decided that fully submerging in that sewer water would surely result in a staph infection or pregnancy. I got out and had long ass hair stuck to my foot. I was, and still am, totally grossed out.

The food we ordered was very good but the staff wasn't super attentive. Again, for a$1500 cabana with auto grat, the service should have been stellar. It was getting to the point where I wanted to put a little bell around my server's neck.

Now it's obvious that men are basically anathema in Vegas ultra clubs without females. That's no surprise. I write this review fully understanding that male groups are the lowest of the low here, but even this was surprising. 

I headed over with three male friends and asked a host if there was any chance we could get in at around 9:30PM. He was super courteous, smiley, and unnaturally helpful. He said ""you guys will wait a while and go in one by one, but it's possible."" He then informed us the club doesn't open until 10. 

So. We wait. 

A bouncer approached us and said there would be no general admission tonight. He said we could go in for a bottle. We could get in for ONLY around 500 a bottle. 

I told him we would consult. It was confusing. We were receiving very different messages from the staff. 

I re-asked the smiley host if general admission was still happening. He said yeah. This guy was so friendly that I was gonna tip him on our way out. 

So we wait. 

Bouncer comes back, offering us a bottle again. We said ""no thanks. We will wait for general admission to open.""

He opens the rope and asks us to leave. He's clearly kicking us out of the line because we aren't going for bottle service. This whole thing stank of some sort of extortion racket.

I am giving Marquee a 5 star because both the times I went, I had a blast. They aren't lying when they say it's a Dayclub & Nightclub. First time that I went, I experienced the nightclub. Second time that I went, it was a pool party. Pool party season in Vegas is March-September. We went in January and they were hosting a pool party on a Sunday with guest appearance, Jeremiah. This pool party was on a roof with a cover over it so if all fails, rain or cold temperature can't ruin it. Brilliant. But I thought it was the perfect temperature in January, sunny but not in the ridiculous triple digit degrees. Once you dance, you are warm anyways so providing a pool party at this time of the year when nowhere else does is awesome! 

My group of girls bought a giant fish tank drink for $150, it was enough to get the whole group of 12 people drunk so if you do the math, that end up not even costing that much for a person. You could get a booth so you could store all your belongings in a cover. Or you could throw your stuff somewhere random & hope it's still there at the end, but warning it could (will) get wet so bring a plastic bag. Bring a zip lock bag if you are going to carry your phone. I am unsure if price depends on what size of the booth or time of year or day of the week, but we looked into it and at that time; in order to get a booth, it would be a $500 promise on drinks & alcohol.

Even the night club part rocks the first time I went. Because it is built to be both a club venue & pool party venue, it just feels nice to have the option of an ""open"" atmosphere whenever you need fresh air outside from all the dancing inside the club.",7,1,2

I swear, it felt like I had been here before - that or all clubs in Vegas look the same on the outside. Probably.

Getting in was easy. We walked right past people waiting in line, didn't have to pay a cover, and got in an elevator to take us up to the club. Fancy schmancy!

Then we got INTO the club...where it is SO DARK. And the demographic here was late 20s to early 40s, except it seemed no one ever learned how to be polite with personal space. The DJ thought an air horn was acceptable transition between every song (hint: it's not), and the music was all current terrible top 40, instead of the old school hip hop that - on the rare occasion they played 20 seconds of it - everyone lost their shit over.

The drinks are about $20 a piece, there is no place to sit unless you're getting bottle service (Vegas, I guess), good luck getting water for anything under $10, and some guy tried to start a fight with my boyfriend because he was knocked into said boyfriend by some random person. Like, get over it guy, it's 3am and you're clearly not going home with anyone so stop being so angry at the world.

Then you have the issue of the creepers. Groups of awkward guys, usually in threes, standing around and waiting for some unsuspecting female to not be attended to\/be falling down drunk so they can take advantage. Watching this take place sober is why I'm a feminist who actively speaks out against rape culture. When my boyfriend went to the bathroom, some guy tapped me on the shoulder and kept saying something to me - the music was so fucking loud but by the look of his face I KNOW what he was asking - and I just gave him the Jenna Marbles ""How to Act if They Don't Get the Picture"" look. THAT didn't even work!

I could stand all of that, however. I could take the overpriced drinks, the pushing and shoving, the lack of space to sit down, the absurdity of that goddamn air horn - but at the end of it all, they made us take the stairs back down to the entrance. FOUR STORIES OF STAIRS. IN HEELS.

Look, Marquee - you want girls to come to your club? You want them to bring the guys who will blindly pay for your overpriced drinks? Then for fucks sake people, don't make us walk down four flights of stairs in heels after dancing for four straight hours. Not. Fucking. Cool.",21,19,8

I've been here a handful of times and I just never have a good time here. I'm not exactly sure why, but XS is just so much more superior than Marquee!

Even though I don't like Marquee, I always end up coming here when I go to Vegas. I don't know why. Maybe because we are always forgiving and hoping Marquee will prove us wrong. So far, nope. Out of all the times I've been here, I've only had a remotely good time twice. Once when I went with my boyfriend and his friends and they got a table - it's always fun when you have a table, lol. And the last time I came here (couple weekends ago) when Sander van Doorn was playing was the only time I had a remotely good time here. Still, meh..I prefer XS.

Marquee is located in the Cosmopolitan and I will admit that the venue is really nice. It gets pretty crowded though and the walkway is kind of narrow, so I don't like that about this club since it results in everyone pushing and shoving so they don't get separated from their group - doesn't help when everyone is drunk, too. Ugh. The outdoor area is pretty nice and I actually prefer to be out there than inside. There are a lot of cabanas and a nice pool. I hear their Dayclub is a lot better than their Nightclub, so I'm definitely looking forward to checking that out to compare.

Aside from all this, the thing I hate most about Marquee are those damn STAIRS TO GET IN. Gawwwwwd. MARQUEE IS NOT GIRL-FRIENDLY, I TELL YOU! There are like a million flights of stairs you need to climb before you get into the actual club. WTF?! By the time I get in there, my feet are already hurting. Ugh. They have elevators to get from floor to floor (they have different levels which is a cool concept) but they only let some people use it...L;HKADH0-9DAIHDP'HODK I can't.

In short, I don't plan on coming back here because my feet will hurt..unless it's for Dayclub in the summer. If my friends really want to go though, I'll go with the flow.",5,1,1

After leaving another club, I decided to go to Marquee because I was staying at the Cosmo and I got a free entry. I thought why not give it another try, maybe I just had a bad night before......

NOPE, Marquee is still a hot mess. I have no idea who designed the layout of this club but it is awful and confusing. The dance floor is a small circle and the hallways are so tiny. You can't even get to the dance floor because the aisles that lead there are packed with people blocking your way. There is absolutely NO space to dance. The bouncers are SO RUDE!!! They will push you out of the way because they can barley fit through the small hallways. We just laughed it off because it was deja vu all over again. I can go on and on....

I mean, if I had a table, maybe I would feel different. MAYBE. With so many other options in Vegas, I would STAY AWAY from Marquee nightclub if you truly want to dance. Just sayin'. I will definitely not be coming back here, even if its free.",0,0,0

I agree with the other reviewers who believe the layout of the club wasn't well-thought through. There's no excuse for any club to reserve half their floor space for bottle service tables, leaving little space for tired ladies with swollen, callused feet to rest. For those of you who have been to XS before: Remember how you could like dip your pretty little feet in the pool for temporary relief? Well forget that shit here because you can't. Maybe you could sit in those cute swinging chairs to chill out for a min? OH NOPE NEVERMIND, WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY 2 OF THEM. And you know, it didn't help that there were too many flights of stairs to deal with...for getting to the club, roaming the inside, and exiting the club. So THINK AGAIN if you chicks want to LEAVE the club for a little bit, because it's a f'ing journey to get anywhere beyond the clubbing grounds...Or even getting to the bathrooms for that matter with a hallway that might as well include VIP tables since they're bottle-service crazy. Jeez.

The main dance floor was below average in terms of size, and in no way did I consider migrating to the jam-packed basement (or I meant their Top 40's dancefloor if that's what they wanna go by). The outdoor area was nice to look out, but that's really all the value it has in my opinion. Couldn't really enjoy it in the 95 degree weather. Also, some of their floor areas need some serious waxing because I felt like I was going to slip in my heels.

So, what did I enjoy then? Those outdoor lounging chairs on the way out from the club. Just because you get to lie down while simultaneously observe guys take photos of chicks at cooch level.",0,1,0

Granted, this may have been because it was 11:30PM on a Friday night, but that's besides the point.  I would strongly suggest getting here as early as you can.

We were told to meet our promoter by midnight.  We walked right in through the entrance towards the back of the casino, and then up a set of escalators.

Around the Chandelier you'll see a massive group of people to the right.  It didn't seem like there was any sort of method to the madness.  Luckily,  we were told to go to the 3rd floor and meet up with the promoter.  There were WAY less people up there.  We told them who we were with, and got let in for free with no problem.

Little did we know that we were about to go up 6 flights of stairs, in heels mind you.  We made it to the Boom Box Room which mostly plays Hip-Hop music.  Our promoter gave us a little tour and took us up to the pool area and main (house) room.  We also got drink tickets--super cool of him!

Marquee is HUGE, and just plain beautiful.  The view from the club is a little bit ridiculous.  As we headed into the house room, I noticed this girl on the floor.  Then I saw security lighting a flashlight in her face.  Turns out, she fell in someone else's throw up on the ground.  How nasty is that?  The look of utter disgust was enough for me, I felt awful for her.  I hope they gave her a comped room or something for her to get cleaned up.

Aside from that nasty little incident, we headed straight for the dance floor.  I'm not a huge fan of house music and it was a difficult to move as there were SO many people crammed into one area.  Made me think of Rain and how the dance floor there gets full so fast.

We decided to go to the hip-hop room in hopes of more space and better music.  DJ Politik was spinning lots of hits and we were dancing the night away.  One guy was a TAD bit too pushy with trying to dance with my bestie, one of the girls in my group almost beat him up, literally.

All in all, we had a great time til our feet started hurting.  We then called it a night and headed for Pho So 1 for a wonderful late night meal!",3,1,2

There are ins & outs once you get stamped, so after we had climbed up all of those warehouse looking stairs, we THEN decided to go get some free drinks at another place before the cut off time... so yes, we walked back down those flights of stairs just for free drinks.  

The last time I was here, I got kicked out b\/c I couldn't handle a drink a guy at the bar bought me and my b\/f (jager, goldschlagger, & patron, but I think the bartender used cabo wabo instead).  So it was like I was seeing the nightclub for the first time!  I didn't make it to the Library, but I enjoyed the Mainstage & the Boombox room.  The patio side was also very nice (what I see most of my visits at Marquee).  I went on a Friday and it was crowded, but it honestly wasn't horrible. We were able to walk around and dance w\/o being pushed around (with the exception of the mainstage dance floor).

Drinks are still great and well worth it (I usually get an Adios or Long Island).  
Not sure if walking up and down the flights of stairs is the new thing they're doing now, but all of the other times I've gone, I entered and exited through the 2nd floor elevators which took us up to the nightclub level and back down to the hotel level.

NIghtclub: like the fact that girls get in for free, love the pool area where you can get away from the crowd.  like the fact that the bar has a water dispenser so you can grab it yourself.  The best room (the hip hop room) is poorly ventilated and OUTRAGEOUSLY hot.  I wish they could move the hop hop music into a larger room\/area.

I will absolutely, positively never come back to the Marquee under any circumstances ever again. If I could give zero stars, I absolutely would. I was in town last week with a big group at the Blackhat\/DEF CON conferences. We decided to throw down a silly amount of money and buy a big cabana at Marquee for Saturday night. Not a table, not just bottle service, a whole cabana. A handful of our group finished dinner early and headed to the Cosmopolitan while the rest of the group finished at our respective client dinners. 

On our way over in the limo, a few people who had headed over just before texted us, frustrated, and said they were leaving because they couldn't get through the line. Worried, we showed up to find there was, in fact, a massive amount of people waiting to get in. We thought we'd be ok, since we had just dropped a bucket load of money on a cabana. Turns out not. We were passed around from rude bouncer to bouncer, and no one was interested in giving us the time of day, none the less telling us why we couldn't get in (they were terribly disorganized. What a hot mess). Finally a nicer gentleman let us know they were on a door hold and we wouldn't be getting in anytime soon regardless of the amount of money we dropped. 

I understand fire code and whatnot, but since we had bought space, we should have been accounted for. So we stood there. For hours (2 1\/2 hours, actually). And watched as scantily clad women kissed the bouncers, begging to get in, and naturally, were let in. DOOR HOLD IS BULLSHIT! Our couple of friends on the inside tried everything they could, and we tried everything we could, to no avail (not even a $200 handshake would sway these guys). Alas, we abandoned our very expensive, practically empty, unused cabana and went else where (where we had a blast, I might add). What a huge, horrific waste of time and money. Go to Surrender. Or anywhere else. DO NOT BUY A MARQUEE CABANA! I've never paid so much money to be treated so terribly.",25,2,2

 Although bouncers and security were originally created to protect patrons from harm (not harass them for blinking an eye or touching water) i have come to accept the inherent douchery that is the majority of  Las vegas nightlife (except for the like 6 security\/host i have personally interacted with who happen to be quite friendly and willing to answer ""insider"" questions) The snoody Very Insulting Host who ask to check your I.D after having just checked your I.D. The bartender who holds your card after processing to see how much you are going to tip him, (in this case a short dark haired guy who works at the bar on the right placed just before the pool).

This is Las Vegas, that's just how it is here, you can't change sin city. Sin City doesn't care what you think about it. With that said, I only rate my outtings on the experience itself.NUMBER 1: If you don't like house don't go to a club that plays house (NUMBER 2: Drinks in Vegas will ALWAYS BE $14 minimum @ MEGA clubs. NUMBER 3: Stairs are for YOUR benefit. If a fire breaks out I doubt I'd be taking my prescious time to squeeze into an elevator.
NUMBER 4: This club is HUGE and full of beautiful people having a great time!!! Strong drinks, three rooms for music, EXCEPTIONAL performers including ballerinas and headlining DJs. NUMBER 5: Go no later than 10:30 best to go at 9:30 or you will not get in.

I loved it, and would go back!

Alex: 1 star. Angel wanted to see Kaskade, so we went even though I try to avoid nightclubs now mostly for reasons mentioned above. I was not surprised. 

I have partied around the fucking globe. Belgium, Germany, Italy, Romania, the UK, UAE, and more. No nightclubs have impressed me less than Vegas nightclubs, and Marquee is the new king of over-hyped, spit-on-your-shoes, I'm-better-than-you shitty attitude that doesn't belong in a venue where you come to let loose from the work week. I was charged $50, couldn't get my male friend in, was constantly pestered by security dweebs, smushed in a human meat sandwich, and of course over-charged for drinks all night. Besides typical Vegas nightclub fair, the overall design of the club was impressive. I wish I could have relaxed like I am able to at Voodoo Lounge, because I would have enjoyed taking everything in.

 Not too much shade, but the place already has a major key to success being that there are places to sit without paying for a cabana or daybed. You can lay a towel out as long as it's close to the pools edge and not blocking walkways. Cabanas are nice and guarded in addition to being shaded and spacious. There are ledges near the pool where you can sit as well if you don't mind being close to a trashcan. The food looked pretty appetizing as well!

 Restrooms are clean with ample mirrors and goodies ( sunblock, mints, cigs if that's your thing(1$) and tanning lotion). Music was typical pop edm hits with some hip hop mixed in when the dj came on. Enjoyed the smoke machines and water gun showers by the hostesses.

As such, the stairs made it even less worth it!

But we did do the full lap around the club.  I must say had we decided to stay in the library (on the top floor) before they hit capacity I think I might have enjoyed it.  They were playing top 40 and their full capacity is perfect, still leaving room to move around and dance.

Marquee does attract famous Djs every weekend.  Best advice is to get your ticket online and come here early as with any other major club in Vegas.  If not, you could give a bouncer some cash.  My friend and I thought we were out of luck with no online ticket, no guestlist, and not staying at Cosmo.  But the bouncer casually asked us to give him cash and we would get in without issue.  AND it worked! 

Two dance floors.  The major one is for EDM and the smaller one is for hip pop.  Both are nearly impossible to move around when packed.  The outside pool area is pretty nice but once its crowded, it's not so fun.  The visuals and the effects at the main dance floor is pretty nuts.  Now the layout of the venue is top floor pool and main EDM stage and then lower floor is the smaller hip pop room and a secluded bar.  Pretty simple right?

I was excited to hear that Dash Berlin was going to be at Marquee on Day 2! My date and I bought tickets early, it only cost me about $20, which is great. I didn't want to stress about guestlist, because I understood there was a cut-off by 1pm, and I wasn't sure if my date and I could even make it to the line in time by then. I'm glad we bought our tickets because they sold out pretty early.

The line to Marquee was pretty long but it moves pretty fast. We were in line by about 1:30pm and made it inside by 1:45pm. It wasn't bad at all. They do check your bag, no liquids or outside food are allowed, not even water. The dayclub itself is smaller than other dayclubs I've been to, the pool here is definitely smaller, but it's still able to fit a ton of people. The cabanas and tables were pretty packed and extremely close together, so it's a little hard to pass through to the lockers. There isn't much of a walkway because everyone's drunk and dancing everywhere, it's a lot of fun.

The lockers are $40 to rent for an entire day. I thought it was a reasonable rate, because it also comes with a charging dock, so you can charge your phone while being in the pool. Restrooms are located right beside the lockers as well. It's think the location is pretty convenient. 

The dancefloor isn't really that huge here, but there's definitely some bit of space to dance. The tiled floors reflect sunlight so it gets really hot. I always try to get in the pool as soon as I can. I don't recommend the pool for Germophobes, it is kind of gross, but if you're drunk enough you can definitely ignore the fact you're sharing it with hundreds of other people. Once Dash Berlin was out, the crowd was wild. I even got to stand kind of close to him while passing through from the restroom. The dancefloor only got more and more crowded towards closing.

My date and I ordered a Jameson and Coke, double shot. It was about $30 for the drink, definitely pricey but it hit the spot. We were drunk and just having a blast in the pool. Singing all of Dash Berlin's songs and splashing water at everyone. You will eventually get wet, no matter how hard you might try to avoid it. I'd say just jump in the water and enjoy it! It's Vegas!

I had a great time at Marquee Day Club. It's definitely smaller than other Dayclubs, but I was very lucky to be here during EDC weekend. I know it's definitely more crowded on other weekends.

There is plenty of room both inside and outside on the pool deck to walk around and mingle. Unlike some clubs in Vegas (Hakkasan, Omnia), here at Marquee it's much easier to meet people and get social. The employees - bartenders, cocktails and bouncers are all relatively friendly here too. I can't stand the clubs where they load up on VIP tables and unless you drop $1,000, you can't have a fun time hanging out with the 'general public'. Well if you get annoyed with clubs like that then you need to give Marquee a try. A very solid venue that is a lot of fun and there are tons of good looking people that hang out here and in the hotel where it's located - The Cosmopolitan (best hotel on the strip).",0,0,0

My main gripe with the club is that they make you walk up these jenky stairs to go up into the club. Many, many interminable levels, in your high ass heels. It hurts. It's not nice. We already get enough cardio dancing, we don't need a stairmaster workout before the drinks have even started flowing.

I like the cabanas around the pool. I like the hospitable people with bottle service up there too, with their free-flowing alcohol for the ladies. :) We ended up staying on the electro level, even though my love is for hip hop. But Kaskade was spinning that night, and he was awesome. Can't complain.

The decor is stunning, as expected from a gigantic new club in Vegas -- especially in Cosmopolitan. And might I add that the hotel itself is breathtakingly gorgeous. If I were loaded, I would stay there.

My friends and I started off on the first level because we had to take a break from all the stairs we climbed just to get into the place. The music was Hip Hop and the bar was easy to access and had decent prices. There is a door that leads to an outside balcony type area that has a great view of the strip and is nice to escape when you're too hot from being inside. The resident DJ Lisa Pittman was playing all the jams we liked and we had fun all because of her! We took a break to see the upper floor which was an open patio area for House music, but we didn't enjoy the music as much as downstairs so we retreated back down. 

One time we were inside and it just began to smell really bad. I'm guess the staff noticed because they burned matches or something to alleviate the smell which I think is great and it worked!

The marquee rent a cops in suits need to take a lesson from the bouncers at Surrender or Tao where they actually bring dimes to your table and not block them.

The staff is friendly and all, but it's Vegas.  That much is to be expected.  Sadly, the Cosmopolitan's ""toptional"" pool fails to live up to any other expectation you might have.  Toptional is their word... it basically means that female guests can take off their tops, but only while they stay confined to their daybeds.  They waited until my wife went for a dip in the pool before explaining the restrictions, she was not amused.  Despite the younger crowd, this is a boring place where you can go if you want to pay for the privilege of sitting down.  ALL the seating comes with a steep food and drink minimum, no matter how dead it is.  You won't have trouble meeting the minimum, though, thanks to the watery and expensive drinks. 

They almost earned a second star because some of the food is actually pretty good (and their kitchen stays open a little later than the other pool's), the music is nice, and the layout has a lot of potential if you bring a big group to liven it up.  And it is a nice place to take a nap once your do order a few drinks.

Tips for day clubbin':
-Watch your shoes or secure them someplace. Some girls had their shoes stolen, no joke
-No large bags allowed. They'll make you rent a locker which cost $30. Perfectly shareable though.
-$15 drinks, but you can get pitchers. Typical club prices though

-Get there early to wait in line.
-Get on a guestlist. Girls, you better work it.

We had a blast at Marquee's LDW 2011 day party and night party. 
Porter Robison, Gareth Emory and Benny Benassi were spinning on the decks with a live vocal performance from Gary Baker to the hit ""Cinema."" They all brought the house down!!! We even got a couple surprise songs from LMFAO.

At Marquee's night party Chuckie rocked the party and Benny filled in for Martin Solevig who didn't show. Paris Hilton and LMFAO made appearances.

Super fun, really crazy, and I loved every second of Labor Day 2011!!!
You should have seen some of the crazy outfits people wore. People act like they have no shame in Vegas and the world aint' watching. These days though everyone has a camera phone. YIKES!!

2.0 stars for size of pool area -

My only gripe is the roof top pool area is way too small to host a big event like this. The pool was also a no go because I don't like rubbing wet elbows with people I don't know. Not to mention that by the middle of the day the ground reminded me of a nasty 7\/11 bathroom. ewwwwww
I had to keep my flip flops on. Who knows what foulness was down there. 

2.5 stars for beds but they were a mess by the end of the event. Not very durable. I am still thankful our group had beds because there is NO where to sit otherwise.

2.5 stars for bathroom set ups 
Just forget about getting to the bathrooms in a hurry.  In the tight crowd at Marquee's pool parties it's almost impossible and you have squeeze through everyone. YUCK!  
The nightclub bathrooms seem like they are half a mile away from the club. You should have heard all the hens clacking loudly in there. It's like they congregate and never get out of the bathroom. Spending tons of time in the bathroom is not my idea of a fun night out in Vegas, but whatevs.

3.0 stars for Staff -
The staff at the day pool were on the ball and kept our ice filled and the drinks flowing. It's a nice almost private pool scene, but not one I would rush back to, as there are other much nicer and more expansive pool areas in Vegas. 

The night party was insane!!! We had a table and the staff are super attentive as they should be for a cool grand plus tip. Definitely worth it if you want some place to sit and watch the crazy peeps and the bottle rats scurrying around. 

Overall I had an amazing Labor Day and would definitely go back to a night event at Marquee.

(Another) high class Vegas hotspot with international celebrity DJs in residence to bring the party every night. Three rooms with different vibes and music.

Actual experience:

I was there: Saturday, Jan. 30. 

Club set-up:
1. Boombox room: Featuring hip hop
2. The Library: Laid back, lounge-y vibe. No dance floor, just a place to chill and relax. Has pool tables, cushy leather chairs and a bar with a specialty cocktail list.
3. Main room: Featuring the headliner DJ of the night. Typically house music. Sound was good, lighting\/visual was bomb with the huge video wall behind the DJ and the disco-like ball from the ceiling

Getting into the club: 
I thought it was hilarious how the guest list line was longer than the actual regular admission line. Kinda makes you wonder if this club lives up to the hype if people aren't being drawn in. Warning: if you're in the guest list line and you happen to have more guys than girls in your group, you're going to be turned away. This happened to a group in front of us. Bouncers were polite and efficient.

To get into the actual club, you're stuffed into this elevator that zips you up to the 6th floor (which is where the main room is located...make sure you keep that in mind given the confusing layout). Once the elevator doors open, you're in this dark lobby area with a bar. 

Getting around the club:
The most confusing, weird, frustrating, and tiring layout ever. What sadistic person decided that the best layout for a club with 3 different rooms was to put them on different floors?? And these rooms weren't just separated by tiny stairs, these were actual FLIGHTS of stairs. Both the girls and guys in my group were complaining about it. I can't picture a drunk person navigating their way around this club. 

There's also two sets of stairs to make things even more confusing. Worse of all, there's no signage that tells you which floor each room is at or where the bathrooms are. You just have to wander around or ask a bouncer.

The Boombox room has an outside patio so if you're tired, hot, and need some fresh air, make your way outside! The Library has some couches and chairs in the hallway that you can sit on without being told off by some bouncer or territorial VIP. 

Crowd: 
Pretty well mixed, and gets really packed towards the end of the night. There was barely any room to move so you get unfamiliar bodies\/body parts pressed up against you (gross). 

Air flow\/ventilation: 
This place got HOT. Bad airflow so if you want to breathe, go out to the patio that's connected to the Boombox room.

Music: 
Liked the main room DJ. Boombox DJ...not so good. We left that dance floor in less than 20 minutes. 

Drinks\/bar: 
Quick service. I was able to get my drinks in less than 5 minutes. Mixed drinks were about $12 (higher for premium ones). Drinks weren't too strong (not strong at all actually) so it's probably a good idea to pre-party.

Restrooms: 
We all know bathrooms are important in the clubbing experience; especially for girls. You need a big enough restroom to handle the crowds of girls that need to pee, primp or throw up (although I didn't see any puking when I was there). Thankfully, there was little to no line for the restroom even when the club was crowded. I liked how there was a huge couch for girls to lounge on while waiting for their girlfriends to finish doing their thing. There was also a separate vanity area with mirrors for girls to touch up their makeup so there wouldn't be any divas hogging the sink area.

Bottom line: 
I loved my XS experience and was looking for something to top that. Marquee tried, but couldn't do it.",2,2,0

-indoors + outdoor space - people only mingle outside. even though there is a DJ outside, no one is dancing. indoor space is PACKED. DJ is upfront  with dance floor below surrounded by booths and tables. the visual projection behind the dj is pretty sweet.

First off, the layout was pretty awesome for the floor Armin and W&W were on.  The dance floor and VIP booths circled around the DJ booth making no bad spot if you were in the main room.  If you were unlucky to not be allowed in the main area, due to capacity, there was on outdoor area surrounding their pool.  They had a live feed coming from being the DJ that was displayed on a huge protector.

When you're out and you finally spot that cute girl you want to dance with... the last thing you wanna stop you is losing her in the crowd because you can't get around some fat guy and a group of grenades. The solution would be more open space and a clear walkway.

I definitely enjoy the crowd here. Not because it's full of Asians but because everyone seems younger and the music is just awesome, sure to enable a ""crackin"" night! They have resident DJ's and guest DJ's all the time, make sure you check it out. Kaskade, Tiesto, ATB, and Above and Beyond are just some of the famous spinners who stop by here and make your night LEGENDARY.

Another thing is, it's definitely hard to get into Marquee if you're just a group of guys. You can't even pay general admission if you're by yourself, you need an even ratio of guys\/girls.",3,6,5

My friend and I decided to go to Marquee that night, as one of our friends told us to check out the newest club that happened to be multiple stories high. So, on our last night, we headed out to Marquee.

First off, the Cosmopolitan Hotel where Marquee was located was utterly gorgeous. Wow. Shiny everywhere- even to the point of the parking garage. You walk into the hotel and that's gorgeous as well. Omg.

We stood in line about 45 minutes to get in. As it was our last night, we were like, ""why not?"" and rode up elevators to the main room....and bam, there was DJ Kaskade cranking out his music and the place was packed.

A little too packed. I had this little girl behind me who had a horrible voice who kept screaming....but nonetheless, DJ Kaskade plays an amazing show. Lights, dancers, and the puffs of cold wind coming out of nowhere....along with his crazy good music? This was my first introduction to Kaskade. I had never even been into the techno\/electronica music, but experience that night was so much fun...that I now am converted.

We didn't even get to see the other floors. But overall experience? What a night, and only in Vegas. How it is without Kaskade? I'm not sure...I don't think it would be as good. But any night that Kaskade is playing...it's so worth it. Definitely go. What a night.",0,0,0

This was once THE club in Vegas to spend your nights, and it still is! Thanks to some great promoters, amazing DJs, and comp drinks for the ladies, Marquee has continued to be my staple for any Vegas trip.

Gents- it's going to be upwards of $50 unless you have some ladies with you (and some hook ups of course). When there aren't any huge EDM names spinning on that night, it's going to be easier to get in, so be sure to check the Vegas EDM schedule.

Marquee may not be the biggest club on the Strip, but I've had some awesome memories made here. Before going in, pound back some Fat Tuesdays over from Planet Hollywood. Yes, get the extra shot of Everclear with your 190 Octane. Then, get in line when you're supposed to. Have your ID and (near) sobriety ready, and dance on inside. The dance floor is moderately sized, so don't expect coming in and wanting multiple rooms. Ain't gonna happen.

Drinks inside are going to set you back $10 - $15 each, but that's a no brainer for any Vegas club. Sometimes, ladies get some free drink vouchers, so gents, be nice to your friends and you'll be rewarded with some sips.

Marquee hosted ATB once and I was livid. My favorite DJ with a great sound system that pumped out the treble and bass to my liking- YES. They even throw down some thunder sticks for you to party to. ATB was amazing that night, and I'm sure there's going to be more crazy nights to possibly remember.

Thanks Marquee for all the fun times!",0,0,2

At first, it was a little discouraging because we arrived at 10 (Marquee, by the way, is gorgeous), but the line was already insanely long.  However, after two hours, we were IN.  

We took an elevator to the top floor (at least I think it was the top) and stepping out, it was crazy!  Lights flashing everywhere, people everywhere, music blasting in your ears.  To the right, it seemed like a slightly more hip-hope scene, but in the center there was a dance floor with a stage and the DJ was playing house music.  The night we went, he was featuring a lot of the top hits, which I personally enjoyed, and once we managed to enter the floor, it was amazing!  The crowd's energy was great, and even though it was ridiculously crowded, it was fantastic.  They had fog and snowflakes? dropping and there were dancers above us on the balconies.  

Outside, where there were cabanas and a pool, it was a little more mellow.  We spent a little time out here to take a break from the high-intensity dance scene.  Also beautiful outside!

I expected the same for Marquee, and it's pretty nice. I think XS is still more aesthetically pleasing, but you can still have a good time at Marquee.

So the only WTF thing about Marquee is its ridonkulous amount of stairs. Y U NO HAVE ELEVATORS FOR LADIEZ?! Seriously?! I think we had to climb like 3 or 4 flights of stairs?! I'm prettty sure I saw an elevator for guys.. UGH WTF 

Anyway, the club is big, has a huge outdoor area, and a really nice dancefloor\/stage inside (Kaskade DJ'd this weekend). My girl friends and I got in for free on a guestlist and proceeded to do a lot of mingling among the cabanas and tables. I like that there are many stalls in the bathrooms (this is very important to me when I go clubbing!). I was pretty buzzed so I can't remember every little details, but overall, it was a good time.

I like the outdoor section at night.  There's even a few blackjack tables off to one side.  The club itself is very small and very broken up.  Unless you have a table (or you're outside watching from a tv) you're not going to see the DJ.  It seems like the club design was an afterthought of of the hotel.  Armin van Buren was playing the night I was there.

If you're waiting to get in you'll never see people walking out b\/c there is a separate and very ghetto metal staircase that you'll have to walk down do get out.  Not the ideal exit when you're wearing heels.

Some nights you can get in for free as hotel guests.  Just show your hotel key and you can bring a +1 also.

Based on previous experience: ladies, you have to get on the stairmaster at your local gym and train in heels before you get here. There's a chance you might trip and break your neck from walking up and down the stairs.

Anyway, I came here with 10 girls around 12 PM this past Saturday (May 4) for the dayclub. Right when we walked up to the line, the security guard clearly had an issue with our group. He gave us a difficult time and questioned 4 of us about our ID's when we're all 21+.

Girl 1: Smile was too big in ID photo
Girl 2: Had different hair
Girl 3: Didn't look like her since she took the picture 6 years ago
Girl 4: Looks different smiling

The stocky, short, bald and Hispanic looking security guard pulled aside Girls 2&3 and immediately proceeded to tell them that their ID's were different girls.

- When Girl 3 pulled out her debit card with her picture on it, he looked embarrassed. She rolled her eyes and walked away. He tightly grabbed her hand and told her he had the power to not let her in. Hun, you work as a security guard. You do not have power whatsoever. Quit power trippin. And I'm sure that shaking from the firm hand grip could be considered assault.

- The security guard asked Girl 2 if she had anything else to prove her identity. This girl pulled out 4 credit cards and her school ID. I don't know about you, but I would never let someone carry FOUR of my credit cards. Also, Girl 2 is Thai and has a ridiculously difficult last name. However, she signed her name 3 times and it was not EXACTLY the same as her ID so she was not let in. Everyone knows signatures can NEVER change.

- We spoke to a different security guard and asked if Girl 2's ID looked like her and he said ""it wasn't his call."" So... what are you allowed to do? So far it seems like no one really works here...

- We asked to speak with the manager and he brought the security guard back over. Apparently first and last names are separate because he claimed Girl 2 signed her name 6 times.

- Employees insist they have no time to deal with this issue. I'm sorry, I didn't know you had no time for your job.

- While we were waiting for our promoter to sort things out, the same security guard came up to us to harass us about waiting. For real. What happened to checking ID's. If you don't like us, stop following us.

- Of course the employees all agree with each other and refuse to change their minds so they can attempt to retain some sort of credibility. They even feel the need to YELL at promoters and girls to prove a point.


No respect. No customer service. No education.

If you ever come across this bald amateur, run far far away. Or wait until he's not checking ID's.

Although the line-up may be amazing, these employees need to get it together. The main reason any club makes money is because of the girls. Treat them better or you can enjoy your own little sausage fest.",25,5,2

I don't understand how people say the bouncers are rude, I have NEVER had an issue getting into this club.  

The main floor and the outside area is the best.  There are two other rooms, the library and the boombox room, which are cool if you like hip hop or want something other than EDM.  

The EDM scene here is the best that you can get in the US, even better than Hollywood (and I'm from LA).  THe main floor is cool because you really can get super close to famous internationally renowned djs. You may even get to meet them ;).  It's the exact same with the Day Club, you get as close as 5 feet from the djs.  The pool party is classy, but fun and with good music, it really does not get any better.

I got a pre-sale male ticket so that was cool since I got to enter at a different part of the club and there was pretty much no wait. All the online pre-sale ticket holders go in the same line (boys and girls). I paid $20 for this ticket--legit.

Anyway, the entrance that I went into was basically like emergency stairs of a building. It was pretty funny watching people walk up these metal stairs--especially since they were wearing heels. Clink-clank-clink. And this wasn't like 15 easy carpeted steps, it was like 4 flights with about 60 steps total. Yes, you will be tired when you get to the top and yes you'll be like, this isn't Vegas at all. Maybe the main entrance is grand and amazing like other places I've been, but this was just terrible. XS has an awesome entrance where you're greeted with the whole club. Marquee is just like an old low-celing hotel.

The pool area wasn't even that nice. I feel like it could have been designed better. At XS you can see the whole pool from everywhere and the design is clearly better for the eyes and the mass movement of people.

I was in the hip-hop room most of the night which was too crowded and the whole dance floor was just people walking through. I went to Haze the night before and it was more fun than Marquee.

The name Marquee doesn't even sound like it's going to be cool.

I have to say that this club is one of the biggest ones on the strip but unfortunately they only play the fast music: house, trance, high energy, etc.  You will probably hear a good hip hop song but mixed in with some trance beat in the background.  Other than the music, this place is huge, there is room to breathe, and the club is pretty posh. What I don't like are the number of stairs that you have to trek to in order to get to the outdoor patio and back down.  This is not good for the drunk people especially the chicks in high heals.  So you see a lot of girls at the top of the patio resting on the side rails to catch their breathe after walking up the stairs.  

The club does feature some hot DJs every once in awhile, but you have to get there early to beat the line, know one of the hosts, or sign up for a $3,000 minimum table tab with a group of people.

We bought pre-sale tickets to this club thinking that it will speed our entrance in.  That was so not the case.

This whole process took nearly an hour!

Once were made it into the doors, we had to climb many many flights of stairs to get to the 1st floor of the club.  Guess what?  Going up to the 2nd & 3rd floor means more stairs.

PROs:
- they invite top DJs
- big lounge outside
- nice interior display

CONS:
- smallass dancefloor
- hence it gets ridiculously crowded especially when the top DJs are playing
- people pushing and pouring drinks on each other
- pricey drinks... $14!!
- $8 for a bottle of water.... 

PS:
- prepare yourself to walk up 2-3 floors to get there!
- buy presale ticket to avoid line

There's a line to get in on the first floor and another line for girls only on the second floor.  We went around 10 on a Saturday night and waited about 45 min.  I recommend bringing a beverage to help pass the time.  We were on a list, so there was no cover, but guys were paying at least $60 that night.  I feel sorry for the guys in Vegas.

The layout of the club is cool because the first floor has a hip hop room, the second floor has the house music and an outdoor area, and the third floor is a chill room with table service, a pool table and it's decorated like a library.  None of the dance floors are that big though.  It also sucks that stairs are the main way to get from area to area.  High heels plus lots of stairs equals no bueno.  

For the short time I was in the hip hop room, they played mostly old school stuff.  The DJ in the house room played good music, but it was incredibly annoying finding room to dance.  We ended up spending most of the time in the library room since we made friends with a bachelorette party that abandoned their table, so we had somewhere to sit.  

Maybe I'll give it another shot when the hype dies down.",0,0,0

PROS: 

1. Great Hip Hop floor (very rare in Vegas now)
2. Excellent EDM DJs!
3. Strong drinks!

CONS:

1. SO MANY STAIRS... literally 3 flights to enter and 3 flights to exit. My shoes are usually off by the time I step out of the club.
2. The dance floor is so small that if you don't get on it before midnight, it'll prob be closed off. It's also super packed so it's nearly impossible to stay there for too long. CAN'T BREATHE.
3. Drinks are expensive (standard), but not a big deal for girls.

There are different lines on different floors.
2nd floor is guest list and that line gets LONG.
3rd floor is presale tickets and you basically go in right away.
It's convenient to stay at this hotel bc you can go in early (no lines), get a re-entry stamp and go back up to your hotel room and continue drinking!
It doesn't get packed until 11PM anyways and DJs usually don't come on until past 1AM.
If you're with a group of girls, security will take you to bottle service tables occupied by all guys.
I love the decor of the place but I wish the dance floor was bigger!
If you are up front, you'll be hit with lots of confetti and sometimes $1 bills are shot from the stage as well!
The outside area (where dayclub is) is also very nice but there's nowhere to sit unless you have a table. 
There are 2 rows of tables that line the main dance floor and a row of tables and another row of cabanas that line the pool area outside.
There are also a few Blackjack tables out there.

That is unacceptable in my opinion for a nightclub.  The layout is also kinda strange.  It is very small inside, and then there is a large outdoor portion with pools and cabanas.  It is fine during the summer, but during the winter, when there is no room inside and only outside standing\/bar space available, it is just too cold.  

Also, at one point I was outside, and the bouncer roped off the entrance to get back in to the club.  My group of friends was in eyesight, but out of ear shot, and he would not let me in, nor get their attention for me.  He said I had to walk all the way around, through throngs of drunk people in an unfamiliar environment.  I let him know that my group of friends was nearby and that I didn't want to get separated from them since I did not have a phone or money, and he wouldn't budge.

Most of us just danced the night away in ur effing club with our high heels on..give us females a break!)

The best thing about this club is that with a promoter you can get in with 1 girl - 1 guy ratio. They usually have open bar from 10-11 pm. I was really grateful that on Friday they extended the Guestlist to 1 am, we arrived at 12:15 am and managed to get in by 12:50 am, even though the line was really long.

For my most recent Vegas trip, we went to Marquee both nights, for DJ VICE on Friday and Tritonal's last performance for the year 2015. Normally with a Promoter, the ratio for almost any club is usually either girls free or 2 or 3 girls to 1 guy ratio, but at Marquee it is usually 1 girl - 1 guy, which is another reason why Marquee is awesome! The previous trip for Memorial Day weekend, my group and I were lucky enough to enter the Marquee Day Club with a 1 girl - 1 guy ratio to see Cedric Gervais and it was open bar.

From my experience, everyone has had a lot of fun here and I have only heard good things, definitely the club to go, even though its not one of the more newer ones, but the overall set up is great.

* Difficult to actually dance because it was crowded and limited space on the dance floor.

We sat inside which is a plus because the pool was jammed packed  and it was hot hot!! Inside was great because it was air conditioned and no sun! Yaay! Hate the sun! Lol! Anyway, the area we had inside was big and the waitress there was the nicest! Actually all of them were nice! 
They poured drinks and were able to take photos... 
The only downside is that we were told we had a VIP bathroom so we wouldn't have to wait for the other one... But it ended up that it was broken and we would have to use the other one with everyone else... But that was fine the other line moved fast...
All in all I had a good time.. The price for this table over the weekend and holiday was 3k. Yikes!  We went with a lot of people so not so bad..

It's obviously the hottest club in vegas because it is the newest. The layout isn't really the best because it can be hard to navigate in and out of the club (esp when inebriated). The two stars is for the ambiance, good music, and awesome promoters.

The reason for my negative experience was Lilli. Blonde bimbo bartender w\/fake D cups working the bar on Saturday, Sept 18, when Kaskade was playing.  At 11:26 (I still have the receipt), I wanted a round of Henn shots for me and my 5 girls. I asked her nicely and noticed she poured up some Henn Privilege. (I ordered the same round of 6 shots from Gabrielle earlier and was charged $84). I was curious why the Priv but sometimes they run out of the regular Henn and give you the Priv. No problem. She rings me up--$102. I said ""wait, I just ordered it and it was $84. Why is it 102?"" With a whole bunch of attitude, she says ""It's 102."" Lilli didn't bother to explain that she poured up the Priv. Obviously, this felt to me like a dishonest way of overcharging her customers. 

THEN, I asked for some iced water for a drunk friend. Lilli pulls a Voss water and starts ringing it up. I said ""wait, i just want tap water."" She doesn't look too happy and takes it back. She starts filling two cups of water, saying ""Water back."" And proceeds to only provide 3 cups of coke back. After throwing down my money, I couldn't even get her attention to get coke back for the other 3 girls. 

With her poor customer service and sneaky ways to overcharge, I left quite unhappy.  Look, I'm not stupid, I know how much shots are in Vegas. I definitely know the differences between regular Henn and Henn Priv. And if you don't serve water at the bar, effing say so.  Bars should serve water to rehydrate patrons so they can sober up and drink more. BTW, if you can't even smile, be nice, and be honest, don't expect a tip. 

Management, if you're listening, you should fire Lilli. Find another blonde with fake tits who can actually leave a positive impression on your customers.",13,11,9

*I love The Cosmo (their parking spots green\/red system, Estiatoro Milos restaurant, Art-o-mat machines, etc) but Marquee was mostly worthless the night I went.

On Fri\/12 Apr I was with a group of total 8 people (3 women, 5 men) going to Marquee.
- That night it was special guest DJ Benny Benassi (did a great set but that doesn't compensate for Marquee's failings) and it was $50\/man and $20\/woman cover charge.  We had bottle service so we didn't have to pay cover.
- Group I was with got bottle service, 3-bottle minimum requirement.  For the 3-bottles Birthday Boy (who paid most of the tab; he was crazy generous because it was his 21st b-day) opted for 2 bottles of Ciroc and 1 bottle of regular Crown so the tab came out to $2,100.  We were expecting $1,500 but maybe that's only if we ordered the non-premium spirits.
- We arrived at the door about 12:30 am and so they put us in the ""Library,"" which was a lounge not a marquee club we were expecting to enjoy.  It played different music from the dance floor so in the Library we couldn't hear DJ Benassi's set.  The Library has a pool table and an older crowd, and to me was really boring.  Only good thing was the music wasn't as loud in the Library so it was easier to hold a conversation (eg with a girlfriend).
- Birthday Boy and most everyone in our group wanted to be on the main dance floor but the waitress was never able to move our table there.  I don't fault the waitress\/staff for not being able to move us since we arrived after midnite, but sticking us in the Library should entail some perks\/consolation (perhaps discounted bottle service, knocking off $200 or so off our $2,100 tab).  We wanted to party at Marquee Nightclub, not the Library lounge at Marquee.
- Making the most of the Library assignment, me and a buddy (the other 6 people were 3 couples so they weren't as concerned with finding eye candy) would walk down the stairs to the main dance floor a few times.
- It was so disappointing because: a) the bouncers at each entrance (about 5 of 'em) to the dance floor would not let me enter the dance floor (they only allowed people to exit the dance floor).  When I asked which way to the dance floor entrance no bouncer gave me an answer.  Really, I can't go to the dance floor in a nightclub? b) Between the main club area and the Library, it was about 2\/3rd's male. 

Sausage fest + $2,100 for 3 bottles + dreary Library table = 1 Yelp star.

Even though we had a fun time everyone in our party independently came to the conclusion that we wouldn't come back here. 

I really don't understand the reviews that are raving about how beautiful the place is. Visually it has nothing on XS and even compared to Tryst or Surrender it hardly impresses (I realize I just named all Wynn\/Encore properties, no I'm not affiliated with them, they just happen to have elegant clubs :))

The level of service we got at Marquee was way below what we would expect for the kind of money involved (2k minimum got us a terrible table, so we upped our minimum to get a decent table). My buddy described it as ""they're phoning it in"" because it is so popular. I think that kind of describes it. Our hostess was absent most of the time and so I wasnt feeling generous and my patience was wearing thin when at the end of the night we had money left over and she insisted it couldn't be closed out without purchasing something. I explained that i understood what a minimum was and that was ok with me I just wanted to close out and get my ID and card back and obviously they keep the difference, we had only agreed to that minimum anyway to get the bigger table. What would be the point of us waiting for her to come open another bottle and bring a bunch of mixers when we were about to leave and what a waste anyway. Just take the money, how hard is that? We literally had a 20 minute argument about this. she even had the audacity to suggest I use the money to buy her a bottle of champagne to take home. Are you serious? I wasnt allowed to use the excess to buy the bottle for the table next to me but I could buy it for the hostess that was invisible half the night? Could hardly believe what she was saying. The whole thing made no sense and was just aggravating for no reason.

My friends and I have had excellent service in a variety of clubs in vegas, so what is Marquee's problem? Power to them that they are the 'it' club of the moment but they already lost our return business so good luck to them a year or two from now when the novelty fades. I don't expect them to have much staying power. 

To offset my bitterness about this experience I'm going to go write a positive review about Lavo and the service we got there the previous night. Sure its a small club and not as fancy but we got treated like gold for spending 25% of what we spent at Marquee.",9,1,2

That being said, Marquee is the hottest club in Vegas, and possibly the United States.  I went here for the first time last summer for a friend's bachelor party and I went back again this past weekend when I made my return to Sin City.  The club is amazing.  The huge open pool area with cabana tables surrounding it is the best day pool club in the city.  It's also a very nice place to party and gamble in the evening at the night club.  Just inside the doors from the pool area is the electronic room...and as a big fan of EDM, I can say this room is incredible.  Huge screen behind the DJ booth including a catwalk featuring go-go dancers.  Luscious tables surrounding the dancefloor and plentiful bars for alcohol.  And then lastly, downstairs from all the hoopla is the hip hop room and the music here is just as bumping as it is upstairs in the larger rooms.

Tips:
- Stay at the Cosmopolitan for free entrance
- Drink before you go. Drink more after you get there.
- It's crowded. Don't expect any space at all
- Table service is expensive (of course). Do you really need it?
- Check the schedule for special DJs and go early those nights
- Marquee isn't open every night. So plan ahead.
- Plan for lots of walking down metal stairs when exiting. Not cool in heels.
- Don't go alone. The guys get really grabby.

My first time at a real vegas pool party went like this.  Wake up in OC at 9am, drive to Vegas at 10, get to the pool area by 1:30pm and it was hotassballs (not a real word).  I really do not understand how these chicks walk around comfortably in what I can only describe as dante's inferno wearing HIGH HEELED PLATFORMS.  C'mon girl, keep it real... your face is melting and your thighs are chaffing.

Drinks were about $14, so be warned, savor your ice cubes in your drink after the liquor is gone.  Each cube is a dollar.  There's no place to sit and it eventually gets soo hot you feel like you might sprawl out and die so you gotta psyche yourself up and talk yourself into entering the overly packed pool.  The DJs typically play house so you can imagine how house dancing looks like in a pool with a bunch of drunkards.  Good times.  At the Marque Dayclub they let you splash, which I learned will get you a stern warning at Encore's beachclub.  So when the beat builds in a song (think fist pumping) everyone starts splashing like 5 year olds... kind of fun to watch, not be a part of.  Needless to say I was drenched, imagine that, entering a pool and being slightly upset that you're drenched from head to toe in what is possibly pee pee water. =\/  

I got out of the water and noticed a divide at the center of the pool, people were trying to push something white from one side to the other and vice versa.  I looked harder thinking it was some chicks panty liner... but, nope.  It was a flippin tampon.  Yes, TAMPON! Oh Lord Baby Jesus, WHY!? *raises hands to the sky*  It was even a brownish color at the tip.  I threw up a little in my mouth after realizing my face was wet from drunk people's pee and a vajayjay blood. :(

What does one do in a situation like this... take out her Amex, head to the bar and double fist alcohol until everything in the world is okay again.

Why the 4 stars?  Because I had a blast laughing my ass off and retelling this story.  Sometimes the bad times make the most memorable best times. (Deep, I know... unfortunately not quite as deep as that girls escaped tampon)",2,8,0

Rude, judging and unorganized.

We reserved a cabana for my older sister's bachelorette party with 14 girls.
My younger sister (also her 25th bday) has never been to vegas, and neither of us have attended a pool party, so we don't know the rules\/expectations.
We brought our Fat Tuesday (bday sister never had one) and the Security looked at us and told us rudely: 
""You can't bring that in here. No outside drinks allowed"".
My sister and I looked at each other like ""wtf??""
Where's the sign?
Then he proceeds to say, ""You also can't wear those tanks because of that bad word""
The bad word he's referring to is ""Bit××""
And told us to flip it inside out!
So we left, already late meeting up with our older sister, THE Bachelorette--- chugging the rest of the Fat Tuesday,
Which was 90% filled up.
Instead of wearing our tanks inside out like idiots,
We opted to not wear it and just walk around in our bathing suit instead.
We were later approached by a hotel staff in a suit saying ""clothes"" are required at all times. BUT we saw plenty of other girls walking around in their swimming outfits,
And what about at night when there are ladies wearing barely nothing going to the club??

***side note, they told our bachelorette party who went in earlier that they weren't allowed to enter Marquee Day Club Pool Party, with just a swim suit.. REALLY???***

So, I put my empty souvenir fat tuesday cup inside my  backpack and proceeded after that 1st security guard who told us, no tanks, no drinks-- ok, done.

Then they check my backpack, telling me I can't even bring a backpack inside, because of limited space and I could rent a $30 locker to keep it there... what the f?! I tell them I have a Cabana. (Which is $1000 to rent) The guy looks at me and says, Oooh, ok you don't need to rent one. Alright, awesome.-- even though he says and looks at me as if I couldn't possibly be at a Cabana!
And then, he sees my empty fat tuesday, and proceeds to tell me that we can't bring the empty souvenir inside. REALLY. That was for my sister's 25th birthday experience, and now I'm being told something different about the cup, and out a $25 souvenir!? I told the security, it was for my sister's Birthday, and he didn't give a fck. So they threw it away, making the birthday girl angry.

So I go to the next checkin point of the line, which is empty, and the woman tells me the same thing, ""you can't bring a backpack, rent a $30 locker"" and I tell her, I have a cabana, and she looks surprised too, like ""Oooh, ok then nevermind""

We enter the nightclub, since that's how you have to get to the pool area, and upon entering the empty club, we see 4 big security guards, escorting out a very agressive and drunk male-- gee I wonder who let him in?

I can only imagine the reasons is Marquee is trying to keep a certain image and want nothing associated with Fat Tuesdays or women wearing inappropriate words displayed pubically... they value their status higher than customer service-- which made them come off rude and judging--- Not a great first impression.

Also, everyone adored our Tank tops and they even knew who my sister was since there was 14 of us, everyone, strangers at the pool party were appalled by the rule of no inappropriate words visible, even though 99% of their customers have said that word more than 10 times in their life.

Thinking about this makes me angry.

People, it's not the location you go, there's many pool parties-- it's the poeple you party with.

The staff inside were very helpful, and in particular, Jocelyn gets 5 stars for being beautiful and awesomely fun. Which can explain why the outside staff were in foul moods-- I'd be upset not hanging in the Pool area too, but doesn't mean you have to judge or be rude to people trying to have a fun time.

Small venue, and gets packed really fast. I love the photobooth, but pictures take forever to send to your email. I can't really speak about the prices because I'm always in a large group of girls and get things free.

Hip Hop room really gets jammed fast all night long, and it's even smaller than the small main dance floor.

As fortune would have it, on the fine Monday night we ventured to Marquee, Redfoo from LMFAO  happened to be there as well. Besides a large blow-up zebra being thrown off the stage, lots of smoke, flashing lights, and random exploding things...I don't remember much about his performance. But, I had an awesome time nonetheless. The energy of the crowd was off-the-wall and was probably one of the primary contributors to the awesomeness of the night. 

We mainly stayed on the top level since this was where LMFAO was performing. However, this suited me just fine since the top level was also my favorite. Similarly to XS, it features the 1\/2 outdoor-1\/2 indoor layout with a pool as well. 

If you're coming on a night when LMFAO will be there and you actually want to see something, DON'T MOVE if you manage to squeeze into a spot with decent views of the stage. As it gets closer to performance time (1am on the night we went), they start roping areas off, leaving only crappy side views behind. 

The only drawback to Marquee is all the stairs you have to hike up before entering the actual club. I'm sure many lady reviewers have mentioned this already, but hiking up a few flights of stairs in 5 inch heels is no fun :( Lucky for me, quite a few of my friends are podiatrists in training, and given all the abuse I put my poor feet through, I'm almost positive I'll be needing their expertise sometime in the future. 

I'm not sure how much cover would normally be for guys and girls since my friend who knew a promoter got our group of 15 in for free. But even if I had paid $20-$30, I still would've managed to party my money's worth.

I've been here twice, and I'll admit, the second time was better than the first, but not by much. 
Stairs, stairs, stairs. If stairs are an obstacle for you, you're gonna have a bad time. These stairs don't even match the club. And what I mean by that is that they look like fire escape kind of stairs, not glamorous-looking Marquee stairs. At least put a chandelier or two in there to give us something to look at while we're breaking a sweat just trying to get to the first floor. 
Anyways, the club. There are 3 floors. The boom box room is by far my favorite. Compared to the main room that plays house music, the boom box room really is the size of a boom box. I haven't spent much time in the library, but I'm sure it's a swell place. 
This place has potential, it really does. It's just over-hyped and a tad overcrowded. I probably won't come to Marquee again unless I really have to...",0,1,0

Friday night: my 4 girls and I were walked into the nightclub by a Marquee promoter and it was quick and easy. The crowd was an OK crowd overall since many people were just wandering around, hanging out and not much dancing. Chuckie was performing that night so we were excited to see him but he didn't perform until 12:30am. I also checked out the hip hop floor with a friend and it was really crowded and stuffy though :( OVERALL, 3 stars Friday night.

Saturday night: my group of girls and guys went out with a speedy entry and the crowd was definitely filled with party people. We had a friend with bottle service in a cabana so everything was poppin, especially those bottles. 2 AMFs that night at the bar costed $30 so be prepared to front bills if you don't have bottle service. Arty and Rider performed that night so it was definitely a great night. It was a 4 stars type of night.

Sunday afternoon: my girls and I were guestlisted in the dayclub pool party and we got in for free as well as open bar wristbands for free well drinks from 11am - 3pm. We arrived at 11-12pm and it was alright since not a lot of people showed up. We got to hang out with another party people group and got the party started dancing in the pool and mini pool stages but we were suddenly kicked out since someone of the other group was caught smoking a blunt. We were escorted out by security since they assumed we were all one big party group that came in together and that pretty much ended our dayclub but they pretty much kicked out the lives of the party. I would give it a 4 stars while we lasted lol",2,3,3

Come on - you're in Vegas, on the Strip, and at the hottest hotel (Cosmopolitan) - obviously everything is going to cost you more.  You're also going to the hottest club out there, so yeah, you're going to spend tons of money.  I knew that, and so I decided to focus on having the best time of my life, and I did!

As a guy coming in on a Friday night, I got charged $50.  Fine by me - we had a hookup so at least the girls didn't have to pay to get in.  If we had a better ratio of guys to girls, I'm pretty sure that the guys would've gotten in for free too.  

The music is awesome - they have a hip hop room, but most of the club plays EDM.  Let me mention that this club is HUGE!  According to my friends, the place is actually bigger, but because we went in February, not all parts are open due to weather.  And it was huge as is!  Seriously, stay close to your friends - you can easily get lost, especially when hella packed.  

My only gripe with this place is that there's a lot of stairs.  Kinda tiring after a long night of partying and drinking, but if you read the reviews, then you would have already known that.  

Seriously - the best clubbing experience I've had in Vegas - I woke up with confetti stuck to me the next morning!  Pre-game before you get there to save some money, but please don't be that drunk guy or gal who gets kicked out.  Go with friends who can handle their alcohol and don't cause too much drama and you'll dance the night away and have a blast!",2,1,1

I love a great pool party but came here on a Monday after a weekend of partying. My gf and I came to the Dayclub for the first time to recover and relax and it was exactly what we needed. The pool area is 'roof top' similar to Tao and unlike places like Encore beach club (my fav), Wet Republic, etc. So compared to Tao this place is roomy and has a regular pool and on the corner a pool with beds and a water fall and for the VIP tables their own private jacuzzi, nice touch. It's a nice place to lay out lots of lounge chairs, but I also feel like it was crowded with lounge chairs. It's unlike Encore beach with a better flow of chairs and tables.

We didn't come here on the hottest Vegas day (it was late Spring) so the minus about this place (especially if your a sun worshipper) is because this place is situated on the lowest part in between these skyscrapers and as the sun sets and moves it shadows this pool area a lot sooner than if you were at Encore or Wet. It's a bummer and we were freezing when this happened.  

I can't wait for my next Vegas trip I gotta come here when it's happening on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. I gotta experience it's party scene.",0,2,2

Has an indoor and outdoor area with DJs. Marquee always brings in great DJs and performers. The dance area is always monitored and even though there are lots of people, you don't get crushed like at other clubs.

Drinks are crazy expensive though...but where aren't they on the strip? 

Overall, just a really great club with several levels.",0,0,0

The wait time for entrance into the club can apparently be up to 2 hours depending on how late you get into line. I highly suggest being in line by 9:00-9:30pm to get in easily, and you'll also save a couple bucks. Guys have been charged $50-$70 for entrance after 11:00pm. Bouncers are douches and narks and will find every reason to kick you out; if they get the tiniest notion that you are too buzzed\/drunk or even just because they don't like you, they will confiscate your id and kick you out! I had to literally BEG for one to give my friend back her id although she was sober and just wanted to know if the water in the spa by our table was warm. They probably just want to make room for more people, who knows, but yes JERKS for real. 

Other than that, the inside is okay looking, I expected it to be designed better but its not. Restrooms are bright and clean with stools by mirrors so you can sit. The best part was the outside area in my opinion. The view is beautiful as its situated nearby the City Center, and there is lots of room to move around, always a plus! Pushy crowded areas tend to get me cranky. There are also plenty of large heating lamps that you can stand by if it gets too blustery since you are outside on a top level. Also lots of different bars to order drinks at! Fast service from bartenders, drinks are about $14-$18 for cocktails. Music is mostly house\/trance\/dance music :) 

TIP: Early arrival, Guestlist ahead of time, Ratio of girls to guys should be at least 1:1. Check online to see who's spinning Fridays\/Saturdays. Have fun!",5,4,4

(To be fair, there were at least two decent bouncers who weren't jerks like the others).  This place is 95% crap area and 5% dance floor.

Main dance floor is quite small and you do feel like cattle. The bouncers push you around and are quite rude.

FUNKTION-ONE sound system, IT WILL MOVE YOUR INSIDES!!! Including your bowels, so make sure you take care of business before the club. The sound is so powerful that I started to bring ear plugs just for this club because sometimes I feel like my ears are just going to blow at any given time.

The other reason, THE TALENT!!! Bajeebus, if you are an EDM freak, this is the place to be. Resident DJs are Kaskade, Above & Beyond, Dirty South, Markus Schulz, etc. This place attracts them all, so get your Untz Untz on!

Also the stage is pretty ridiculous too, the dancers dress in the most outrageous costumes. This girl once shot fireworks out of her bra (think Austin Powers femme bot).

I brought my student ID, which used to work, but now it doesn't. We even brought our gas bill, and it still doesn't work. 

Nightclub: For women in heels, this place is the worst club to go to. You first start off at the House music room. In order to go to the other rooms, you have to go up flights of stairs, which sucks in heels. Even to exit, you have to take stairs unless you leave after 1:30am. I must admit, the House room is fun ONLY when LMFAO is there. Other than that, I hate it. The bouncers suck because they block the dancefloor after a while. They keep pushing you around the dancefloor and don't tell you where you can go, because there's NO where to go. The Hip Hop Room is packed, hot, and sweaty like Tao. It's gross and ridiculous.

When we finally arrived at the pool we couldn't move. And neither could the people in the water. Please see my uploaded photo of the pool aka sardines in a can. 

Maybe the daylight puts things into perspective (I REALLY wouldn't want to see a nightclub with the lights on...scary) but everything just seemed dirty.

We got bottle service outside Sunday night and had a chill time. Keep in mind, the atmosphere outside is totally different than inside at the main dance floor. Sunday was a good time but nothing crazy. Then comes Marquee Mondays. I have never in my life partied at the same club two nights in a row. Met some girlfriends for dinner at STK and they were set on going to Marquee for the night, while I had plans to hit XS (previously my favorite Vegas club) for Afrojack and Skrillex. 
  Of course, the ladies got their way and we ended up at Marquee, again. IT WAS INSANE! 
  DJ Chuckie started off the night and got the place going, then Benny Benassi gets on the decks and kills it. It's 3AM and this place is just getting hot....LMFAO and the PartyRock Crew come on and this place goes ape shit. You know you're in the right place when Will.I.Am is high-fiving you for spraying Veuve all over the crowd and Paris Hilton is dancing to your left with her hands in the air like a stoned, high school senior. 
People that dont like this place.....go somewhere else. The music is the best in Vegas (resident dj's include Kaskade, Avicii, Dirty South, ATB, Benny Benassi to name a few). If those names don't ring a bell, again....go to another club. You'll probably catch on in about two years. 
  The energy, light show and sound system in this club is top-notch compared to any club in the country. The staff was nothing but courteous and willing to help with any request our tables had. The crowd was unbelievable as well. Beautiful people everywhere just getting together to party hard. 
Tips that you should already know (but I'll re-iterate anyways):
1) Don't be a jackass at the door. That won't help your chances. 
2) Bring your money and be prepared to spend it. You'll have a much better time, I guarantee it.
3) Tip well. It's good karma and makes you look like less of a douche.
4) Bring a group of hot ladies with you. Again, you'll have a better time.
5) BE READY TO PARTY....you won't be disappointed.

BEST NIGHTS TO GO: Monday, Friday & Saturday. You have more celebrity hosts & performances on these nights. Monday nights is a better mix of tourist and locals. Me and the girls had such a blast here when we went on a Monday night.

LOCATION: 2nd Floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel

LINE:  Opens 10:30pm. General Admission tends to be the right line and table check ins on the left. Don't hesitate to ask someone that works there to make sure you are on the right line. 
WAIT TIMES: 45min-3 hours (Fri, Sat & Mondays) Quicker on Sundays. Best time to arrive by 10pm to avoid a long wait that can kill your buzz fast. 

DRESS CODE: Play it safe, don't wear any sportswear. Wear nicer shoes gentleman and come in wearing a collared shirt\/ or sport coat.

DRINKS: Mixed Drinks Start $15, Beers $8, Shots $8 Table Service Bottles starts at $475. Lots of bars\/areas to get your shots going.

TABLES: Most people i've talked to prefer mostly booking a table in the main room where most celebrity dj's play at. The library is more intimate, has pool table and the Boombox below has different music\/vibe. I enjoy the Main Room the most every time i've been there. 

ENTRY: $30-$50 (Women $20)

**If you buy pre sale tickets, ticket holders will not go in through the General Admission lines but ticket holders will enter through a separate entrance which is usually much faster. For bigger events this is usually prefferable than the later.

Me: ""Hi, we're not sure how this works...?""
Doorman: ""How many girls?""
Me: ""5""
Doorman: ""Okay, come with me""

That was easy. We skipped the line and didn't have to pay cover! +5 stars =D. Marquee is huge! The dance area was super packed so we decided to walk around outside first. After scouting out the scene by the pools\/outdoor bars, we decided to go to the dance floor...but got separate along the way because there is a bouncer to the entrance of the dance floor and only half of us got in. This began a 30min search for the other half of the group. After we found everyone...this random guy decided to follow us...to the bathroom and actually waited for us outside...wtf? (The bathrooms are really pretty and there are huge vanity mirrors so you can fix your makeup!) After we finally ditched him, we were able to have some fun!

We didn't realize there were other rooms (because it's so damn big) and we were tired of the house\/techno music on the dance floor, so we peaced out and moved on to the next club on our list. Next time I come, I definitely want to check out the other rooms!",0,0,0

We were all on a friend's guest list. Due to unexpected complications, we didn't get in line until a little after 10pm. So very long story short: Make sure the person who's name is on the guestlist is with you when ur getting in. The girls barely got in, and the guys had to pay. I had to tip the doorman a bill for the guys to just get in and still pay the cover.

Lesson learned: Pre-order tickets or get in line way earlier.

There's many different levels and sections. Think Tao Club on steroids. It was so crowded that I didn't get a chance to explore and see everything. I only got to see the bottom floor, which seemed crammed and not impressive, and the level with the main pool patio area and the main dance floor. I'll take Brian C's advice next time and get in earlier so that I can actually walk around and check the full venue out.
When we were at the outdoor pool area, it started to rain. Great - it was already packed but now everybody was scrambling to get out of the rain to get in the already crowded insides of the venues.

The place was PACKED and beyond poppin, and in my honest opinion, I think in terms of being the most popular\/desired nightclub, Marquee takes the cake in Vegas. As for the outside pool\/patio area, XS still holds a strong edge.

So yeah, I think due to the negative circumstances, I didn't have a great first impression of this place that most people seem to have. I will definitely give this place another try someday soon and hopefully it'll be a little better.

Dayclub-  Friday as hotel guests were told we get in free, when I showed up they wanted to charge $20 each, there was no line at all and the place looked dead, I only stopped by because a friend was working and was going to say hi. I never went in and just left. Saturday we were walked in and after being ID'd and going up the elevators we had to wait in yet another line to be searched and let in, it just seemed disorganized. (everyone was looking around the with WTF looks on their faces) When we get up to the pool deck there is almost Nowhere to sit\/stand.....there were so many daybeds and loungers empty for rent you could barely walk around. I'm all for selling out your daybeds and such, but when your guests are almost falling in the pool to more from point a to point b there is a problem. At WET you have room by the pool to sit on the edge, lay out a towel in some areas, etc...here the daybeds go all the way to the pool edge all around the pool, you can lay a towel behind a daybed, but in the walkway by the bar....I'd recommend taking out a few loungers so your guests can move. We stayed about 10 minutes and went down to the boulevard pool in the hotel (this would be a MUCH better set up for a pool party)

Nightclub- We went on a Saturday night around 11:30-12:30 with a big name DJ playing....the line wrapped all the way around the club into the hotel walk way (over by the tall shoe installations), must have been a few thousand in line...we had a about 8 girls and 3 guys and were able to walk right in as hotel guests. When we get up the club is SUPER dark, more so than usual, the place is like a maze with all the different rooms and unless you have a table you really can lose your friends. It was also packed to the point it was hard to walk around. Our plan was to get early and get our stamps so we could come back in later through the readmission door. (some girls had to finish getting ready, and we wanted to go back to the room for a few drinks) To our surprise the exit and readmission is down these crazy back utility stairs almost 5 flights down! So all the girls in 5"" heels and mini dresses were walking up and down the stairs just to leave\/return....really ruins the ambiance of the club when you have to leave out of a back fire escape. Again I think this is due to the disorganization of management....club seemed like it would be ok with a comped table with friends, but if I have to walk down the stairs again to leave...no thanks!",0,0,0

Yes, I know Vegas pool parties are not fair for a bunch of dudes and frankly we all get that. 

But this goes beyond that. Granted we had a great time and have nothing but praise for the service from our table hostess and her crew. However, when we arrived that morning we were greeted with lies and broken promises. Here is our quick story. We did our due diligence and reserved a table weeks in advance. We picked out the exact table we wanted and didn't argue the price we were given. Our VIP host Anthony Khotsikian said cool its yours. But when we checked in we were rudely told we got bumped from our table, the new table was take it or leave it and Anthony was no where to be found... Nice way of handing the people who RESERVED one of the most expensive tables (not cabana) available. So instead of trying to work with us or offer something to help subside the situation... they instead insisted we keep the same money limit, get a smaller table and a not as good location. We had no backup plan, they knew that and took advantage. We didn't want to ruin the day so we bit the bullet. I did my homework on the prices before hand I knew the new table wasn't as expensive. To verify I asked around the other tables near us if they didn't mind sharing their table limits. Yep... they were all much lower than ours. Just bad business...

I'm not a write a review person but i wanted to share our story for the rest of the guys out there trying to do Vegas the same way. Vegas planning sucks for guys if you are not balling out of control. So I hope this helps out the rest. I do highly recommend the party itself but the front end office is questionable. Do yourselves a favor and if you do come here and are getting a table. Double check your reservation the day before so you have a back up plan if needed. Especially if its from Anthony",5,0,0

Why anyone would stand in line for 3 hours to listen to HOUSE MUSIC! (I hate house music! To get a better understanding of how I feel about it, peep this: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5T0DiYyYkYQ). Don't worry- this review will be based solely on the club and not its music preference.

I'm a 702 veteran, and I know that boys have it real tough in Vegas. Most of the time, I have a heart of stone and make our group of boys figure out how to get in the club themselves while us girls skip the line :) Unfortunately, this was NOT an option at Marquee. In order for boys to even be allow entry into Marquee, they were REQUIRED to have a 1:1 ratio. (Security was literally walking up to guy groups and kicking them out of line.) So our group of 20+ girls waited in line with the 16(?) boys so that they could get into the club. We waited for 3 hours. I'd say we should get mad props because we could have gone to the girls only line and gotten in right away.

Once we got inside, the club was SOOOO PACKED. UNBELIEVABLY packed. I felt like the entire club was as packed as the floor of a NKOTBSB concert. Marquee, how are you going to make me wait 3 hours to get into a club that I can't even dance around in? HM?

Yes, the venue is beautiful. Yes, they have a great sound system. Blah blah, Kaskade was playing.... I don't care. Alls I know is that:
1. All venues in Vegas are beautiful
2. I don't have to wait in line at other clubs
3. I actually have room to dance around at other clubs
So compared to regular clubs, Marquee is decent. But compared to other Vegas clubs, it's not worth it!

My friends and I bought pre-sale tickets to see DJ Chuckie this weekend and arrived around 12:30AM. Since we had tickets already, the bouncer just let us up to the front and we got in rather quickly. The elevator service to take us to the club was impressive and the operator was good at getting everyone pumped. 

As soon as I stepped into the club, the dance floor was PACKED. We squeezed our way to the dance floor but were unsuccessful at getting anywhere closer than at the very back. DJ Chuckie was okay, but I've heard better and I guess I wasn't really feeling the vibe at first. Especially after I accidentally ended up eating confetti twice when they turned the machine on two times during a 15 minute time period. Guess I shouldn't open my mouth to scream, ""WHOOOOOOO!!!!"" whenever they turn the machine on. 

We left the dance floor to grab drinks, and since I already pre-gamed, I decided to just get an orange juice. However, upon paying $4 for a small glass and tasting it, I discovered that it was WATERED DOWN by a lot. Come on, bartenders. You're charging me more than double the amount of what it's worth but serving me half the actual amount of what it is. Not cool. 

And I guess leaving the dance floor was a bad idea, since the bouncers were not letting people back in throughout the night, so we just decided to dance towards the back of the club at the entrance to the outdoor area. My friends got separated often because it was so crowded and hard to find each other. 

The outdoor area is quite pretty, although not nearly as spacious as XS or Surrender. There weren't a lot of sitting areas and walking around in 5-inch heels are not fun when you're wandering around looking for a seat.

Overall, it was an okay experience, although it wouldn't be my first choice. It is, after all, one of the ""hottest"" clubs in Vegas at the moment and they attract a pretty friendly crowd.",2,2,1

Came this past weekend to see Dash Berlin. The club itself isn't that big. I mean, it's big if they open pool area where there's another bar and a few tables for you to gamble. But if they close that part out (which they did later in the night), then the club becomes much smaller. The bouncers and security dudes working here were cool (at least to me), which is surprising because at other Vegas clubs that I've been to there are some that are straight dicks who probably enjoy that power play. Actually, everyone seemed pretty friendly from the bouncers to the bartenders, which in my opinion is super rare in Vegas. But my experience and opinion might differ from the next person. 

The dance floor itself consists of a pretty small area and like every other club in Vegas, if you're a dude, be prepared to have some random dude start dancing in front of you out of the blue. It happens. The drinks are pretty much in line with every other place in Vegas as far as prices go. I think I paid $11 bucks for a Corona and about $9 for a Red Bull.

I recently attended a private event here, the AJA VIP party, during NAB 2012 and had an amazing time. I arrived two hours late and the whole place was packed already. There were people everywhere.

I now had the challenge of finding all of my crew. I started collecting them one by one like a mother hen looking for her baby chicks. I established an area outside in front of the pool. Close enough to enjoy the DJ inside but not close enough to have to yell until my voice was horse.

The outdoor pool area is incredible. Yeah I know it is a pool by day but I've never seen it under the sun so it's all new to me! There were elevated cabanas with private hot tubs and cascading water falls. I made a loop to check it all out.

I also found that the bar behind the pool way in the back was a little less crowded, so I decided to stock up on my vodka on the rocks. I just needed two until I decided to hit the road back to my hotel.

As we were leaving we got stuck just staring at the DJ. He was rocking the room unlike any DJ I've ever seen before in all of my years on the clubbing scene. In fact, two things kept us locked there in a trance. First he was in this set where he kept slamming songs every 20 to 30 seconds and this went on for over 30 minutes. He was also covering music over a 30 year period and the crowd was just dancing there hearts out. The second thing was the giant light wall behind the DJ it was a show all by itself. My favorite was when it would go full bright lights and all you could see was the DJ's black silhouette standing there. I still have no idea how he could see any of his music!

Yeah this club is worth it for a fun time. I'm coming back here Vegas. I also recommend if your a company and looking to throw the corporate event of the year in Vegas then this is the place to do it!",6,4,8

Their bottle service quote was actually double what Tao at the Venetian charged us for the same amount of dudes which shocked us but we had no other realistic option.

Walking up the entrance, I was shocked by the length and actual number of lines they had.  Kinda felt sorry for some of them.  Our line seemed a bit lengthy but our wait was short.

Instead of having to take stairs, we had the privilege of being escorted up through an elevator to our table.  Bottle service attendants were great and friendly and security dedicated to our area took care of the numerous moochers that overstayed their welcome.  I'm more of a hip hop fan so I was disappointed our table was in the main, house music area.  I was too tipsy and legs were too shaky for me to walk often that night and having to maneuver stairs was a bit much for me.  So naturally I was stuck with the house music.

Once inside, its like Asian chick heaven (for dudes).  I've never seen so many hot Asians in one spot before.  Up, down, round and round, they were EVERYWHERE!

But here's what I did like about My experience here.
Being a girl with 12 other girls.. essentially not much waiting in line. 
The dance pit was cool, very compact but once you're in it, you feel like you are IN IT!  I love that feeling.  I can ignore the fact that there are armpits in my face when I know I'm having a great time.  Dance the night away.  The DJ, the lights, the adrenaline keeps you pumped up.  This is Vegas.

Here's what brought my 5 stars down to a 3. 
I dunno if the elevator was out of service, or if they always make people take the stair, but being in heels.. asking ladies to walk like 9 flights of stairs is a little pain in the ass.  They were metal stairs too. so clank. clank. clank.  Felt kind of like cattle herding. 

They have a bouncer at the dance pit area who supposedly regulates the crowd.. really?  So he harshly said a stern no, but 2 minutes later we snuck in anyways.  That's not very effective is it?

The outside area is nice but gets kind of crazy-crowded.  This is how it is, although next time I go, I'd like to try snagging a table and getting bottle service.
I'm getting old.  Which means the crowd nowadays doesn't listen to as much hip hop as they do this house stuff.  I think the room that plays hip hop was closed.  So eventually when the house stuff starts moving towards the no-lyrics-just-repetition.. I get bored.  The highlight was when they played Swedish House Mafia, Save the World.  I did enjoy that one because the whole room as singing and dancing along to it.",3,1,2

Love the electro & house music, especially the great djs that spin here, but the main dance floor is so small that it's nearly impossible to get on it and actually enjoy the music.  The club also gets super crowded that you can barely move and sometimes are forced outside and not let back in.  Half the time I'm trying to maneuver around people trying to find a place to stand or dance without getting bumped or stepped on, and the other half I'm climbing up and down the damn stairs, trying not to eat it.  

The good thing about this place is that they have multi-level dance floors, so if you're not into the edm scene, there is a hiphop dance floor downstairs.

They do have towels provided for you so we just carried our credit cards and sunscreen in with us. It didn't make for a fun start, neither did the 20 minute line to get a drink.

Ibiza in Vegas? Not that I would know since Spain is half way across the world, but Marquee's house & trance crowd is still going pretty strong. Great sound system and stage with lots of pretty LED lights. Only downside here is the smallish main dance floor which gets super crowded and forces security to cut off people. You can still hear the music outside in the day club area but it's not the same. If you find yourself downstairs in the hip hop room at Marquee, you're probably doing it wrong but to each their own.

Haven't had bottle service here yet but one sure way to skip the lines is to hop on the presales sold through their website, guy or girl. If they aren't at capacity, there's in and outs the back way by the Boulevard Pool, where presales enter.

Don't miss Kaskade when he's spinning here, or any other top 100 DJ for that matter. The clubbing crowd can be a mixed bag of like minded music lovers to super douchey bro types. However, don't let that get you down, Vegas is still learning to embrace EDM.",2,2,1

The main room seems to mimic that of Tryst and Wynn, with the tables surrounding the main dance floor in a fan shape and then at the other side it opens out to the outdoor area.

What I did not like about Marquee is that the different rooms are on different floors that you have to access via stairs.  You can say that I'm an idiot, but we did not find these rooms until we were on our way out through the stairwell.  I would have liked to check out the other rooms but after checking out the entire main floor end to end, it didn't occur to me to check the stairwell for another room.

Drinks: $14 for a shot of Patron, which is pretty standard in Vegas.

The outdoor area was pretty nice with the heat lamps, since it was a chilly Vegas winter night.

My girlfriend and I had Double Date wristbands for Kaskade's Summer Lovin' series - meaning that we had access to both the Dayclub and the Nightclub within the span of the same day. We really just can't get enough of Kaskade. 

The first of the two shows took place at Marquee Dayclub, where we had no problems at all as far as finding the correct line to check-in and claim our wristbands at. The girl who put our wristbands on even went so far as to cheerfully make sure that they weren't too tight on us - a gesture of kindness that I don't witness too often in the clubbing scene.

I've learned some handy tips for those not familiar with Marquee Dayclub: 

- I'd advise getting to Marquee Dayclub early - that's your best bet for getting a pool towel to use. That towel, in turn, will allow you to stake your claim somewhere near the pool area (assuming you don't have a chair\/cabana on deck, of course). We had little trouble getting a great spot near the main Dayclub pool, being that we arrived at around 12:30 PM or so. This being said, we may have arrived at this day party a bit too early - Kaskade didnt come on until almost three-and-a-half hours after we arrived (although Amtrac had the party rocking all day long!).

- Free water is provided for on both sides of the bar towards the back of the venue, behind the DJ decks. It's got hints of cucumber and is consistently nice and chilled (and never empty), so you've simply got no excuse for paying for bottles of Voss water other than for the sake of looking bougey. 

- There are blackjack tables at the ready, all prepped to take advantage of drunken passerby. My advice - don't be that guy. I didn't see a single soul walk away from that table with any look on his face (only the fellas bought the bait) other than that of complete and utter defeat. 

One rather sketchy transaction took place after the lady and I bought a Daiquiri from the bar stationed at the back of the Dayclub. My girlfriend paid with a $100 bill, and it was a good thing I went through the trouble of counting our change back - our bartender shorted us on change by twenty bucks! You would think that it's a common practice for someone working in food\/beverage service to count cash back for a customer (especially with larger denominations), but this server made no effort at all to do so. Of course, after her mistake was identified, our bikini-clad bartender was happy to correct things (""Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetie!""), but I was still suspicious. Frankly, I wouldn't have been surprised if she would've contested this claim, had we not caught it right then and there. 

On the flip side of things, the overall vibe of Marquee Dayclub is laidback, sexy, and irresistibly fun. For me, dayclubbing doesn't exude as much of a pretentious sort of vibe as nightclubbing does, and this was certainly echoed at Marquee. From the group of Asian girls proudly parading around with a massive Kaskade cutout head (which they were repeatedly lending out to other groups of attendees for photo ops!), to the group of gay guys that couldn't stop complimenting my girlfriend and I on how great we looked with one another, the place was filled with folks who just wanted to have fun and take in the experience of a complete departure from the real world. 

Coolest of all were the lucky partiers who had booked VIP cabanas that day; in addition to spraying the crowd with bottle upon bottle of Cliquot (we're talking like a college tuition's worth in champagne here, folks), the dayclubbers in one premium cabana kept providing my girl and I with free Heinekens - all in all, I must have anywhere from $30-40 thanks to their generosity! I felt like I was on the set of an episode of ""Entourage,"" or something to that effect. Needless to say, the crowd at Marquee Dayclub made the ""Summer Lovin'"" feeling seem all the more real for us. 

Speaking of, Kaskade himself delivered a set that was perfectly geared for a hot Las Vegas day. While it wasn't as diverse as his Marquee Nightclub set later that night (review coming soon!), I nonetheless enjoyed his mix of melodic build-ups and electro house breakdowns. Per usual, everyone's favorite funky Mormon DJ exceeded expectations. 

Needless to say, Marquee Dayclub was a bit of a departure of the norm for me. The Dayclub bug has bitten me, and I'm downright addicted.

During the peak hour, dance floor got super spacked both times. My friends and I were locked out unless we paid the bouncer. We paid $20\/person and it just went downhill from there. People are shoving left to right, elbowing you, stomping on you, etc. A couple in their 50's kept shoving me to go to the front so I pushed the guy really hard and he looked at me like if he was going to hit me.

Actually spent a good amount of time at the Night and day club on my past trip to Vegas.  Luckily we got hooked up with VIP entrance through a friend of ours. Got in relatively quick with no silly cover charges or extended waiting.  Of course they provide a limited number of tables if you want to play.  

The place gets pretty jam packed especially toward the end of the prime pool party season.  I saw two famous DJ's here for the first time: Armin Van Buuren here and Dirty South which was awesome at a venue like this.  All the staff are pretty cool here and fit well into the party atmosphere.  I had a great time partying with our group here, so I can't complain.  I think the outdoor area of the place misses some of the wow factor that some other competing outdoor pools.  

The second day here we ordered some food to see what they had to offer.  I got these chicken skewers that they told me would take a while to prepare... hoping that they'd present me with something rather good.  The actual chicken was forgettable but the salad on the side was alright.  My friends ordered burgers which I didn't feel like eating but might have been better.

The venue has 3 levels and a beautiful outside pool area...so it's kinda like 4 venues in one! Depending on the night, it could be an EDM club, or hip hop club, or a club with multiple sounds depending on the level\/room that you choose to be in. The nightclub is open every Monday, Friday, and Saturday nights. I tend to favor Monday nights as that's when most of the locals attend. The Dayclub is usually open everyday between April and October (depending on the weather). The weekdays at the dayclub are usually calm while the weekends are ridiculously off-the-wall, in a good way though!
Even those the type of music varies at Marquee, they always have THE top DJs. The crowd is always very high energy. The gogos, lights, and confetti are great visuals to accompany the music as well. Being on the dance floor while the DJ does his set is a stimulating experience for all of your senses.
I would highly suggest bottle service if that is an option for your budget. The waitresses are well trained with the best customer service on the strip.

Lines: If it's your first time the lines could get kind of confusing. I suggest going onto the Second floor in front of the Entrance there's usually a guy who's holding a Marquee direction pole. YES its a pole with Arrows telling you where to go, either your Guest list, All girls, Ticket Holders, or General Mission that sign will tell you where you need to go. The lines can get pretty long, so I suggest go early like 10-10:30 after that expect a wait. Wait time's can get to be over 2 1\/2 hours I've even heard. They are very strict on the guy to girl ratio so 1:1 at least. 

Music: EDM, top 40. Marquee lives up to the name ""Ibiza to Vegas"" If you didn't know Ibiza is like EDM party central in Europe. Always the best line up expect nothing better than Marquee. Trust me Marquee never disappoints to put on a great show. 

Price: General Admission for guys is $70 and girls $30. So I advise you to either buy tickets early (which I've heard is cheaper) or have a promoter. Girls added to Guest list are free. Drinks are pretty pricy, for a crown and coke it was $14, but its Vegas what can you do.",3,0,1

We were escorted out and only when the big bad bouncer made sure we were all out did he give back the license and credit card.

If GTL is your lifestyle...then you would fit in perfectly at the Marquee Dayclub. Just saying.

I really love Marquee as a nightclub because the pool area looks so classy and gorgeous at night, but during the day I wouldn't be able to tell this pool apart from a frat house pool.
Me & my friends LITERALLY stayed at the dayclub for less than 30 minutes. In fact, some of the poor guys in line said to us as we were leaving ""That great, huh?"". 

The pool area is just too small to fit that many people. Whats the point of going to a pool party if there's so many people you can't even get into the pool?
Maybe if you had a table the experience would be better because you'd actually have a place to sit & lounge.

Great place, but it takes planning to get inside.  I've been twice to the night club once in April and recently on Memorial day weekend and once to the day club.  Cute girls contact a promoter, follow their instructions and you'll get in no problem, but getting to the right line might be a bit of a trek so give yourselves an extra 15 minutes to figure out where you're going.  

Whenever I go theres always cool DJs and I always have a good time. I love how this club is both indoor and outdoor.  

Theres music for everyone at this club because it has so many different spaces.  I don't know how the pricing is because we either had open bar, bottle service or someone else always bought our drinks in this place.

The day club is fun too, but crowded (can't expect anything less on Memorial day weekend) as far as I know Marquee day club was free on the guest list.  Drinks were difficult to order.  the cabanas look amazing and each had their own jacuzzi - that seemed really cool.  LMAFO were also chilling at the pool that was a fun sighting.",0,0,0

My first pool parTAY ever definitely went out with a ""bang"".

The staff was great. I have ZERO complaints. The drinks were fab, although I kept my minimum to Veuve Champagne.  
I loved the DJ, and may have cursed out of love that he was spinning DeadMau5 AND Adele. Not simultaneously of course. 
We also ordered some pizza and fries, the fries were hot(taste) but the pizza was good. I also ordered a pitcher of frozen lemonade with vodka...WOW. At the taste of it, I dropped my glass of Veuve and didn't look back to see if anyone was hurt by the glass. 
After about 6 glasses of Vueve and other misc. drinks in my body, I felt safe to step into the pool that now had over 80 private parts bumping and grinding to the fab DJ.
The only complaint I have, which is by most....why the EFF do we have to go down an escalator while highly inebriated? Most of us are half naked, and because of this, luckily we are not snagging any jewelry, undies, or shoe laces.

After how god awful XS was I swore to myself I would never go to another Vegas strip nightclub. However after some coaxing from my friends, guest list, and free drink tickets, I had a change of heart. Worst case scenario I didn't spend any money to have a miserable time. I expected the worst.
I got through the line in about two minutes and went inside. I, unlike a lot of reviewers, actually like the stairs and layout. Maybe it's because I enjoyed seeing people struggle to walk up and down them in their ridiculously tall stilletos. Seriously, I get it, it's a Vegas night club, but are they really practical or necessary?
The outdoor pool area was open and it was a beautiful night out so I spent most of my night out there waiting for Prydz to come on. There was plenty of room to sit and talk to my friends which was nice as I usually can't even hold a three sentence conversation at a club without tearing my throat. Even as a local I never get tired of an elevated view of the strip and the roof top does offer a nice view.
My friends and I have this corner near the back bar we go to because you have plenty of room to dance without trying to go on the dance floor. Why would anyone go on any of the tiny, cramped dance floors in Las Vegas? The whole point is to be insufferable to the point you'll buy a table next time. The view of the screens from back there is meh but I don't go to a club to stare at an LED screen, I go to dance. Give me dancing room and I'm happy. Not to mention, being arms length away from the less used bar is always a plus. 
I was extremely impressed with the lasers during Prydz's set, out of all the night clubs I've been to in Vegas i'd have to say the production there was the best. It wasn't overdone to the point of being tacky or triggering an epileptic episode. It also didn't have any stupid pyrotechnics that made me feel like I was being set on fire.
I left the club that night buzzed and extremely happy, which was the total opposite of how I thought I'd leave. I was anticipating having the worst night ever after the horror stories I've heard about Marquee but thankfully escaped unscathed. Will I ever go back? Eh, maybe. Unfortunately Prydz is the only artist they book that I like so I don't have much reason to return. Either way, 7\/10 experience.",6,2,4

I had a reserved table and showed up at 12AM and got in with no waiting. 
Had a table on the 2nd tier, table 46, and it was a great view of the dance floor and had enough space for our own personal dance area. Dropped about 6K and it was well worth it.

The club is absolutely beautiful, the music was off the hook (Kascade was playing, amazing!), the sound system was ok (I am spoiled by Funkion 1s on the regular).  My host that night is a friend of one of the directors there, and we were treated to VIP.  Unfortunately, my friend and I lost our other friends early on, and weren't able to be in the VIP area with them,  but being an outgoing and friendly women, we made new friends..... Here comes the bad\/scary part....  Towards the end of the night, the bouncers usher everyone into the main dance floor area and closed the back patio and bar... We met a man and he asked us to sit up on the ledge with him.  A big bouncer came over and told us to get down.  We said no, we are out of the way and are resting for a minute up here.  He seemed angry and told us to get down, and I jumped down, and he grabbed my right arm, extremely hard and pushed me forward.  It hurt so bad! :(  I immediately went over to a bar to the right and the bartender was cleaning up, and I told him what happened, he got the security supervisor.  The security supervisor, Michael Betts, took me to a back room where they had 2 EMT workers there.  They took my statement, put a cold compress on my arm, and talked to me a bit and I started to calm down, I was crying and scared.  Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.  At this point, also I should state that in the commotion, I lost my other friend I was with. So I was alone, and didn't know really what to do.  Mr. Betts was very nice and helpful, and gave me his card, if I have any questions I am able to contact him, which I might do today.  After I left the room with the EMTs Mr. Betts walked me around a little bit to see if I could spot any of my friends, which I couldn't.  Then he took me out to walk in the front of the elevators, as that is the only way to exit the club.  I had a drink there and waited, they didn't show, so I left.  What a horrible end to what should have been an epic night.  I hope the bouncer that hurt me was fired.

We saw Gareth Emery (4\/20) at the Nightclub and then went to the Dayclub opening for Avicii (4\/21) and had the best time I've ever had in Vegas.

Gareth Emery-Amazing set. We had a tier 2 table for 3k miniumum dead center, 1 row from the dance floor. Usually goes for 5k or more. Once we got there, they bumped our minimum to 4k due to demand. I did not like the increase but it's Vegas and we were still getting a deal so I went ahead and paid the difference. It was totally worth it. Glad we did not bounce and go to XS (aka the club run by the ""foot clan"" that asks for 400 dollar host tips to sit your party on a table the size of a bar stool...i could go on and on).

Around 4:30 AM....Right after ordering a $1100 magnum of champagne to finally hit our minimum, Gareth Emery was tearing it up so hard that I decided to climb on top of our booth, which is about  5 ft up, to ""fist pump"" like a d bag (not recommended). At the time, I was a pretty hammered to say the least. I did not realize how slick the bottom of my loafers were and slipped and  fell off the booth and smashed 6 or so glasses of champ and the bottle.  Holy balls--this shit never happens to me.... Before I could realize what happened, the security team came in ""red team go"" style, picked me up, and took me to a back stairwell.  At this point, all of my party swore I was going to jail. And they continued to rage like I would have wanted them to when spending 4k plus tax plus tip.

Not so fast... Once in the back stairwell, I realized they had brought me to a medic instead of beating my ass or taking me to jail.   The medic was super nice and she cleaned my wounds, made sure I was okay, and then sent me back to the show to continue domination. My buddy's were like ""They were saying we gotta get this guy back out there!!"" No where in Vegas would I have been treated this well. I can say say that if i had just paid cover like many I would have been bounced in a heartbeat  but the security at Marquee takes care of the those that spend an arm and a leg to party. The club finally shut down at 6am and those in my party still rocking and I headed back to get some sleep before the Avicii party opened at 10 am.

The opening of the Dayclub was the highlight of everyone's trip. We got up at 9:30am and headed straight to Marquee so we wouldn't get caught in the bottle service lines like everyone else.  

One of the hottest DJ's in world (Avicii), plus a cabana, plus the best looking people in Las Vegas. Service was again top notch and our cabana was filled with Marquee and Avicii paraphernalia to wear or to pass out  The food is actually pretty good as well and goes towards the minimum spend. If you are going to spend the 5k to get set up in a cabana right in front of the stage then they will make sure you have the best time of your life. 
Since i'm a Dallas Cowboys fan, I drunkenly decided to tell that to D'Angelo Hall (who had a day bed right in front of us) that I am a cowboys fan and the Redskins suck.  Lucky for me, he was more interested in getting booty thank kicking my silly ass. I wasn't trying to start shit although i am not sure what i expected to happen by opening my mouth to a pro bowl athlete.  The vibe is really good though.. Nobody was trying to start fights or piss each other off (except me apparently?)

Recommendation, do not go out after the dayclub--you will be inihilated and spend every dime you have.  Going to the Dayclub is a weekend worth of Vegas fun wrapped into 8 hours by the pool.

I will be back as soon as I can afford to do it right.  I will never go here without at least a daybed so i can have a home base and have somewhere to put my wallet,flip flops,etc.

The set up of this club is slightly different from the main hot spots in Vegas. It's about 3-4 floors in the Cosmopolitan. The top floor has something called the library: closely mirroring a lounge type area. The main floor has a huge dance floor, massive LED screen and patio area access to the left\/corner. Then the bottom is another dance floor that plays mainly mainstream hip hop type music. Stuff you can get down and dirty in. 

I loved how this club doesn't get boring. Most clubs play a certain type of music  (ie. XS, Surrender) and if you don't like a particular song, you kinda just gotta tough it out. But for Marquee you can just leave for another dance

Crowd-wise: young. Its the newest club in LV so it bring a more clubbing ambitious crowd. 

Cons: I came with lots of girls and they made us come from a different entrance to avoid the line BUT it involved climbing 3-4 flights of stairs in high heels and short skirt. Not cool.

When you're leaving and have had a few drinks, you better hold on to those rails because you're likely to venture on to those mile long stairs again going back down.

They had body guards that stood around ""hall"" and they always tell people to keep moving. I guess it's for safety reasons, but they wouldn't let us into the dance floor until my friend asked nicely.

Overall the experience is okay. I didn't get to explore the whole club. Floors are a bit slippery. So be careful ladies! People got drunk by the time I went in and because the spacing is so tight, I accidentally knocked someone's drink onto the floor.

Great thing is that they do offer free water, do-it-yourself, kind of thing. I think every club should have that!",0,0,0

Located inside the Cosmopolitan on the Vegas Strip this club has it all!

The set up is similar to Kress in Hollywood, 3 stories, with a rooftop area only the club is better and bigger! But it's Vegas so of course it is!

To start, get there EARLY, we got there around 830\/9 and the line was already long! If you can tryy to get on the guestlist to get guys discounted ($45 from $60) Sheesh! I know! .. I don't know how much they normally charge girls because we were on the GL.. Very important though! The ratio of girls\/guys needs to be EVEN! They will not let any guys in without an equal amount of girls! It's just how they roll! lol (Honestly, I prefer even ratio, it's way better than a bunch of one sex runnin around) 

TIP: Go at 8\/830, get your stamp, go back to your room, drink, pregame, w.e and then come back around 11.

The security is insane and the line has all these different areas for different things (VIP, GL, Bottle service, etc.) BUT they are very organized and OMG the bouncers and elevator guys and stair people are sooo nice! I was in shock! They were even goofing around and would conversate with you instead of just give you looks... at one point the elevator guys were competing on who had the most girls! lol...

So the club interior is off the chizzain! It's ultra fresh and the outdoor patio! OMGGG! lmao I'm getting excited talking about it... There was lights, wind (natural, which I liked cause it made it feel tropical), jacuzzis, pools, bars, cabanas! Shit you name it they got it! The outside are is more for lounging, chatting, drinking, as there is no dancefloor, but it's an awesome area to chill out and relax!

The dancefloors were packkedd! They only had two that I saw, not too big, but decent, find a spot and dance your little heart out - they had one techno room and one hip-hop (I was in hip-hop) .. The music was great, I danced for hours straight! :)

You know Vegas, so I wont talk about parking, if you're there take a cab, etc. I stayed at Vdara which is next door so we just walked over. Very convenient!

The only thing is when you leave it's a bitch to get out and you have to go back that way if you leave and return, not through the main entrance.. its pretty confusing and kind of a long walk, not gonna lie! So ladies bring some fast flats! :)

Overall you really should check this club out! When I go back to Vegas I will be going back! ;)",0,2,1

Yes, DB is one of my favorite EDM DJs. Great mixes, great beat, that's not too overwhelming, as in a very good combination of energy. 

Okay, back to Marquee. When we got there, as expected, the lines were extremely long for general admission. And there was no way we'll stand in those lines waiting an eternity to get in just to stand around the bars poisoning our livers. We're not in college anymore... ha! So as planned, we got table service. Even though it was extremely expensive (2k+), it sure beats standing around with your party. We had our own booth, our own drinks, our own waitress, and even a bouncer who stood nearby us. Yes, we felt like celebrities with the VIP. 

The inside and outside area felt like two different worlds. Both areas had their DJ spinning. Bars were everywhere, and people drank while hippingly swaying to the beats. The inside is obviously much darker with lights flashing in tune with the beat. Tables were stretched around the whole club set for bottle service while there's a dancefloor in the middle.  The outside area ""the beach club"" seemed very tropical like as in an island feeling. I'm glad to say that there were no knucklehead problems, no fights, and security was tight. Our waiter\/waitress was easy going while they made sure we were catered to. Even the bouncer was cool. I really enjoyed our time there!  And yes, we got very ""light headed"" and everybody in our party had a blast.  We had so much alcohol that even our neighbors from the other tables came to drink with us. Good times!

I was a little disappointed in the Marquee Dayclub. We left EBC and came here since somebody we met had a cabana here. We probably arrived a little after 3pm and the whole pool area was already shady! There was absolutely no sun anywhere. 

Getting in wasn't a problem since they didn't have a special dj that day. The pool was a lot smaller than I expected. I would say it's less than half the size of Wet Republic. You also can't bring your drinks in the water. They have to stay in the ledge. Wtf kind of bs is that! I bouncers had to keep on reminding us to put the drinks back. I've been to 5 other pool parties in Vegas and this is a first.

Just as the story goes in Vegas, guys had to pay a wholesome price of $45 at the door but I had a slight feeling that they didn't mind the price too much once they were in the pool of hot girls dancing around them on a dance floor. The dance floor was rather small but the club was pretty big with 2 bars indoor and 2 bars outdoor. The outdoor area was actually a poolside and even had blackjack tables even though I didn't see anyone playing cards. 

Every once in awhile, and as bizarre as it was, the guard carried out two ladies in mermaid outfits on a oversize cart like the ones you see at the CostCo then picked them up and dropped them into the pool so they could swim around in a pool that was by 11pm filled with cocktail straws, cigarette butts, and some unidentifiable trashes floating here and there.

My group ended up staying in one area for most of the night, so I knew where to find them and went to the bathroom by myself.  Do I recommend that females use the buddy system in clubs?  Absolutely, but I was not intoxicated and know how to hold my own.  They had started shutting down the outside area (without warning- it would have been nice to know when I headed to the bathroom).  I was confused about the shutting down of the outside area and explained to security that my group was outside.  She snapped at me ""STOP SAYING WE!!""  Mind you, I never even used the word ""we.""  I'm sorry, I know the security guards have a job to do, but it absolutely disgusts me that they would not be more concerned about their female patrons - especially in a huge place like Vegas where many people are from out of town, unfamiliar with their surroundings, and have been drinking heavily.  The tone she took with me was totally unnecessary; I was nothing but polite to her and only said one thing before she came unhinged.

All that being said, will I go back to the Marquee?  Yes, yes I will (see initial paragraph).  GIRLS, USE THE BUDDY SYSTEM!!! Security only cares for you so much.",2,1,1

The stairs are killer. We saw a girl slip down the stairs. I'm sure that happens all night. Wearing heels is a hazard but it's Vegas, I'm going to wear heels, as are other girls. Why are there stairs?!

My heart swelled when I saw a hip hop room with boomboxes and a neon ""You down with OPP?"" sign. My heart was crushed however because they eventually stopped playing hip hop all together and it was only around 11pm! WTF. IT IS THE HIP HOP ROOM. WHAT IS THIS NONSENSE. There is already house music on the main floor what the heck is this?! On top of it it got so packed in the room you literally could not move. I couldn't breathe. I was so sad. 

I loved that they have an outdoor area but then there isn't any music and if you do hear some it's the house music so if you love house and electronic, it's definitely your spot. And you will have room to dance, unlike the hip hop room that doesn't actually play hip hop for very long...

The top floor was very chill and kind of nice because WOW we can actually have room AND they are playing hip hop? But it definitely wasn't meant to be danced in so that kind of offset the hip hop playing. I want to dance to it, ya know?

Whatever. It might be the hot spot in Vegas right now, but I'll pass.",6,4,1

Which means there is barely a chance for those who are not on the Guest-list to even make it inside. Sorry about it. 

One of my favorite moment was the elevator to get to the club after going through security.  They totally make you feel welcome and the bouncer completely turns the light grumpy light off and gets ready to party on with us as we enter the club level.  

This place is a little bit confusing to get around if you have already pre-partied before this or starting to get intoxicated from the moment you enter the place.  There initially are a lot of different areas to dance in, but depending on the crowd mass some dance areas might just turn into standing around area.

Otherwise, you're going to be in for a long wait. Before you do get a table, make sure the ratio of your group is spread out (typically they always like more women than men). Luckily I know a promoter who got us a table and bottle right away, and the wait for that is not too bad considering how big your group is.

Marquee is definitely one of the more unique clubs in Las Vegas, as there are different rooms and areas for different means of clubbing (a main dance area with the DJ stand, the Boombox room for Hip-Hop, and the outside pool for socializing and also dancing to an outdoor DJ\/system). What I really love about Marquee is the pool outdoors; at least you don't need to be shouting over your friends to talk in order to actually hold a conversation, and its a nice area to come get a breath of fresh air from dancing inside. You should definitely aim to get a table out there since there's a lot more room to dance around your cabana and get some free space. Be careful not to finish your entire bottle right away, for the instant you do, you'll be ushered out so the next group could take it. 

My only drawbacks is the dance floors are very tiny. I agree that the stairs are a liability waiting to happen for anyone drunk and strutting around on platforms, but that's why I always try to club in cute shoes that aren't heels. ;) Otherwise, I had a blast at Marquee! Definitely a switch up from all the typical Vegas clubs that have one standard theme, at least this one switches up the atmospheres! I have to say hitting up Marquee on the weekdays is a lot better than the weekends from a local perspective, especially on Monday nights!",1,0,1

I was out on a 3 day Vegas vacation with some high school buddies this past weekend. It was a while since we all got together to have a little bit of fun. We decided to do VIP and get bottle service. On the Marquee websites the price was set for 10 people at $1000. Tax and tip would be a separate charge. 20% for gratuity and 8.2% for tax. I did the math and I was expecting to pay around $1,300. But this actually did not happen. When I received the final bill the total was actually $1,656. Way above what I was told at the door by the promoter. The worst part is that there were fees charged that were never mention at all. Like a
 $78 entertainment fee, water bottle fees and some other things that were never brought up in my arrangement with the host. Needles to say, I felt like I was completely taken advantage of. Even if I can afford it, it was completely wrong for them not to provide all details before having anyone sign any agreement. The marquee night Club was a disappointment. I had better hopes for the location. But definitely not the experience I was looking forward to. Try other clubs and make sure you emphasize to the host to explain all the details before you sign anything  and do not sign until you see the final price printed in a piece of paper. Ask for a copy as well. Another tip is try other clubs. A good club is Omnia. I had a way better time at Omnia and the irony is that it was completely free to get in and have a good time. Omnia is Way way better by far. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Marquee.",0,1,0

The bouncer checked our I.Ds, put on the wrist band and sent us to the elevator. There was an employee in the elevator that escorted us up to the floor. He told us to walk around and we would find the pool.  Well if you don't pay attention you will miss the stairs up to the bar and pool area. 

Once we reached the Marguee there is a small store front selling T-shirts and souvenirs. There is one bar, a few tables to gamble at, lounge chairs and cabanas for rent. It was a Tuesday afternoon there were probably 100 people enjoying the area. 

We took a seat at the bar and ordered a drink. The bartenders were nice and service was quick. Two well drinks cost around $30 plus tip. Since there is no cover I think they charge more for drinks.

As many people have noted, Marquee is freaking huge! Some comments about the layout:

Pros: There's a little something for everyone with a bottom level playing primarily hip hop, another with mostly house music, and the Library on the 3rd floor that's more of a lounge. I can't really comment on how enjoyable the first level or the Library are since we never really moved away from the bar by the house music. (What can I say? My girl friends know how to have a good time... ) 

Con: Stairs are a terrible terrible idea. Intoxicated girls in heaven-high heels trying to navigate their way up and down several flights of stairs? It's a huge lawsuit waiting to happen. 

** Tip: If the stairs are a bit much for you and you're starting to regret wearing those hooker heels you just couldn't leave at home, just invest in a pair of flats that they sell in the bathroom. (Hey, it's Vegas -- they think of just about everything!)

Also, because of the popularity of this club, it gets absolutely packed by 11. The promoter claimed that there were 7,000 people in Marquee the night we went and I completely believe it. The dance floor was crowded to the point where it was difficult to even get onto the floor, much get your groove on. 

Drinks here were typically priced for Vegas but were decently strong and rather tasty. Also, the crowd here was great -- young, hip, fun, and generally easy on the eyes. More importantly, we didn't meet any really creepy guys and everyone was just out for a little fun. 

One last note, Marquee is supposed to be one of the harder clubs to get into. For girls at least, the easiest way is to wander around and get in with a promoter. He (or she) will walk you in right when Marquee opens at 8, you get your hand stamped, and then you can leave to eat\/pre-party\/club elsewhere before coming back and entering through the re-entry line (which is infinitely shorter than the main entrance).",2,0,0

The dayclub used to open at 10:30 but they changed it to 11. It was my second time at any dayclub and I wasn't sure what to expect. We got there super early and secured a nice spot in front of the dj booth by the pool. The pool is really small there. 
I went to the bar and discovered the fishbowl! $150 for a cocktail on their list (some light and fruity and some super strong). We got one (strawberry cooler) for our group and it took us 3 hours to drink it. I think it is worth it (we had 4 people). The bartender that helped us was super nice and patient and explained the menu to us. 
When it got more crowded it was harder to get the bartenders attention but we really didn't need anymore alcohol. 
Only bad thing was we found out the main dj wouldn't come on till 3. I was instructed to be there by 10:30 so it would be a super long wait. We ended up leaving before the dj came on but had a really good time. 

For the nightclub... I've had more negative than positive experiences. The stairs especially! 6 flights of stairs is hard for drunk girls in heels. 
The first time I went it was super crowded and hard to move around. The next few times were decent. One time I was there to see a specific dj and bought tickets for it only to discover they changed it last minute. I was very disappointed. 
But this time around it was not bad. We got drinks and somehow wormed our way to the front of the dance floor. It was still crowded but it was one of the better days.

We got in through a promoter so the girls got in for free. The guys still had to pay which sucks but guys have to pay anywhere they go in Vegas. There was no celebrity DJ but this place was so popping. All i heard throughout the night was untz untz untz. It was pretty much EDM overload and since I am not a fan of that music, I had to force myself to appreciate it. It is definitely an experience I will never forget, especially since I came out of that place with huge blisters on my feet. Lesson learned girls, buy those foldy flats. They will save your life.

I think that the overall venue at Marquee is soooo pretty and gorgeous. It is super crowded inside and you will get pushed and shoved around like at any Vegas club. What differentiates this place is the BEAUTIFUL outdoor patio where all the bottle service is. There are bars out there, lamps, tables, couches and little streams of water. The only negative is that there is no actual seating for people who dont have tables. The only thing you can do is sneak a seat on the dividers between tables and hopefully those people dont mind you sitting in their space. It beats XS where there are even fewer places to rest your feet.

XS is STILL the #1 club in my book but Marquee should definitely be on everyone's Vegas clubbing line-up.

On Sat, 2\/19\/11, we came to Marquee for the FINALE of my friend's Bachelorette Party. So that there would be a home base for everyone, we opted for bottle service which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:

GUEST LIST 
FREE COVER for girls

GENERAL ADMISSION COVER
$20 for girls and $50 for guys

LINE
Unlike other LV clubs, Marquee opens at 8:30 PM and I've heard the line starts forming at 8 PM! 

There are separate lines for GA, GL, and Bottle Service. The lines are LONG for GL so just go to the GA line and pay for cover. 

WARNING: Bouncers will NOT let you in if you show any signs of being tipsy in line. 

DRESSCODE
Club Attire; NO tennis shoes, NO baggy jeans, NO flip flops and NO ""T-shirt Time"" (collared shirts for the guys)!

Tip: Ladies, I HIGHLY recommend investing ~$10 for a pair of Dr. Scholl's Fast Flats. I bring these babies every weekend when I go clubbing and they are a lifesaver! http:\/\/www.drscholls.com\/drscholls\/forher.jsp

CROWD
Mixed crowd w\/ 35-40% being Asians; majority in their mid 20s to early 30s.  

AMBIANCE\/DÉCOR\/LAYOUT
Marquee is part of the Tao Group and is a hybrid of Tao (layout) and XS (ambiance\/décor). Unless you're a Stairmaster Nazi, you will NOT like the layout of Marquee. 

There are 3 rooms. There's also an outside pool lounge area but it was closed that night b\/c of bad weather. 

Upon entering Marquee, you have to walk up 5 floors, about 8 flights of stairs to get into the 1st room.

ROOM #1: BOOMBOX ROOM - 5TH FL

There's 1 large bar, platforms for go-go dancers, a dance floor and bottle service for about 7 parties. 

MUSIC
The DJ was spinning Top 40s, Hip-Hop, Mash-ups, Rap and Pop. Unlike Tryst, XS, and Surrender, House music was NOT mixed in! Yay!

The compilation of music the DJ played was good although there wasn't a smooth transition from one song to another. Nonetheless, the girls and I ended up dancing on top of the couches which is a good indicator we had a blast!

ROOM #2: MAIN ROOM\/PERFOMANCE ROOM - 6TH FL

""Above and Beyond"" was performing that night and the main room was CRACKING before 10 PM!

The main room was like a combo of XS' classy sheekness w\/ a touch of an underground rave feel w\/ all the glowing florescent lights and fishnet claded go-go dancers w\/ bright wigs. There were 2-3 large bars, multiple large booths for bottle service and 1 large dance floor.

MUSIC
House. If you are a House Music Fanatic, you MUST check out the main room. The sound quality was awesome and each UNCE UNCE UNCE was clear and crisp! 

ROOM #3: LIBRARY - 7TH FL

The library (smallest room) is a ""man's man"" room w\/ a rustic western feel, complete w\/ classic wooden furnishings, a pool table and antique-like books that  you can actually read! There was 1 bar and several very small tables for bottle service.

MUSIC
Trance. My raving days are long gone, but I actually enjoyed the music for the 5 mins I was there.  

STAFF
The staff at Marquee ROCKED!!! This made up for the poor layout, hence the 5 stars!

PROMOTER\/HOST: Mike Tran was AWESOME! When I was arranging for bottle service, he was on top of EVERYTHING! He always responded quickly to all my calls\/texts and annoying questions.  

Even though Mike was working at Tao that night, he text me to make sure everything was ok and even came by to Marquee after Tao to make sure we were having fun. Seriously, who does that?!?!?

A special thanks goes out to Waldo for handling the logistics of our bottle service and Gia for help facilitating getting the girls in. 

BOUNCERS: Unlike most clubs, most of the bouncers were very friendly.

Joe, the bouncer near our table was the BEST! He was friendly, sociable and made sure I didn't lose or get my phone stolen since I stupidly left it laid out on the table.

BAR\/DRINKS
$15\/shot for premium shots\/cocktails. Drinks were easy to get at the bar w\/ a wait of 5 mins max. However, my friend bought me 3 double shots of Goose (yes, I'm a lush) and each looked like a single shot. 

BOTTLE SERVICE
We got bottle service in the Boombox Room and the minimum was $1,500. 1 Liter of Goose is $495. If you do the math, 1 Liter equals 33 shots and each shot at the bar is $15 which is also $495! There is an 8% tax and 20% gratuity BUT it saves you the hassle of waiting at the bar and you have your OWN area. WELL WORTH IT!

Our VIP hostess, Shauna was the sweetest thing ever! She was on top of everything; promptly made our drinks, ensured our area was clean, and was there the entire night overseeing things.  

RESTROOMS
There were restrooms at every room level w\/ multiple stalls, so there was NEVER a wait! A variety of toiletries was available: lotion, hair care products, perfume, eyelash glue, gum, etc. 

Thanks to the Staff at Marquee, I had one of the BEST times of my life! I can't wait to come back and make a GRAND EXIT by jumping into the pool...",39,14,14

I had heard so many good things about the club, I had such high expections. I go to Las Vegas at least two times a year. We do at least one girls trip a year and at least one birthday a year. Every time we go we have at least one night at a club with table service. Being that the Marquee is a up scale club I was expecting excellent service with first class accommodations,sad to say I was extremely disappointed. To my disappointment by far this is the worst table service I have ever experienced. The night started off with as soon as we entered the club the staff trying to collect more money then what we had already paid and had arrangements for. After dealing with and settling that issue in about 15 minutes, it took over 45 minutes to even get our bottles to our table. Yes that's right it took over an hour for us to receive any of our drinks. Followed by one of the servers spilling a drink on the bride, ruining her shoes, leaving her  and her dress smelling horrible and sticky. She got a quick sorry  as the server laughed and left never to be seen again, not even a replacement drink was brought to our table. We never got the goodie bag for the bride or the complementary Champaign that was part of the package and was paid for. The server told use that there was no packaged deal such as the one we paid for and they had never heard of such a thing. We had to bring up an email on OUR phone to show the package deal we ordered. This is not a way to run a business so unprofessional. Most of the staff was not very friendly and we saw our server maybe five to six times in the 6 hours we were there. We were never asked if we needed anything and (for the first time ever in my 14 years of Vegas trips) when we ran out of the bottles we had ordered we were told we had to go to the bar to order more drinks. I have never had that happen, we have always been served at our table. I have myself personally had table service at eighteen different clubs in Las Vegas, marquee makes nineteen and never have I been treated so poorly or been so disappointed.  The club it self is very nice,clean, splendid decor, enjoyable ambiance, great music, variety and large, its such a shame there was no costumer service skill what so ever. Our bus boy James is the only one that I have anything positive to say about. He was very sweet and efficient.",4,2,1

The first couple of nights I was in Vegas, I had to went to Tryst and XS. They were cool, but nothing that ""blew me away"". 

Well, that all changed when I went to Marquee. This place is freaking amazing. I was surprised to find that getting into Vegas clubs was easier than in NY or Miami, at least with my experience being a guy.  In any case, i was literally blown away by the energy of this place and just the massiveness of it.  The main DJ room is a true experience with the glass panels and dancers coming out of the wall. 

The pool area was phenomenal and a great change of pace if you didn't want to get all crowded and hot in the main room. I walked around some of the other rooms (hip hop, etc) but I was there for the EDM. ATB was the DJ that night, and he just killed it.

While the main room is crowded and there's traffic flow problems, if you can find a good spot it's a great time. The energy is amazing and intoxicating. The entire crowd feeds off it and it's just an incredible atmosphere. The lighting, use of smoke and other presentation aspects are the best I've ever seen at any club i've been to in the world.I went back the next time I was in Vegas and had an even better experience knowing where to go and how to get in.

The bouncers are pretty strict about the dress code (i.e. you need to wear a sports jacket at all time if you're not wearing a dress shirt) but overall they're pretty friendly suprisingly. I'm used to the rudest of the rude in Miami but for the most part they were pretty cool.   


This is a place I plan to go everytime I go to Vegas. Even though the tables on the dance floor are offensively expensive, if it was a bachelor party I'd absolutely do it because having that type of space but being right in the middle of it is worth the experience once in your life.",1,0,1

It's a mission just getting to the club! Took the stairs and it was about 3-4 flights of stairs to take before actually getting to the club. Drinks $15 

There are 3 levels: Boombox, Main Room & Library. 

Boombox plays top hip-hop and rap hits. It's really a war to get on the dance floor, but me and my cousins found a way to the back close the rail that divides the tables and dance floor. It was really fun in the beginning, everyone was dancing and we even meet some cool people. The night I went was the night that Lebron James, John Wall, Paul George, Dejuan Blair and Matt Leinart decided to come and get a table. So more and more people just flocked to the side where me and my cousins were to try and take a picture of Lebron and everyone else. It was insane how pushy everyone got just to get a picture. Honestly Lebron was so tucked away in the corner you can barely see him. And the DJ was no help telling everyone where Lebron was. Also the DJ repeated a lot of songs, he played ""Don't Drop That Thun Thun Thun"" about 4 times, within 3 hours! really bro?

Main Room was all house music that night. The lights were flickering throughout the whole night, it was pure madness. You can barely see people because the lights are just flickering constantly. 

Library is at the top and is really chill. Has pool tables and limited seating. The music they were playing was mostly reggae. 

It was pretty fun and an amazing experience seeing the NBA players. Just didn't like the flights of stairs, it was a super workout and how the crowd became once the players entered the building.",2,0,0

The casino itself is eye candy. Walking past the stunning colored glass inside Cosmopolitan got me pumped up for what to expect at Marquee. On a Monday night around 9:30, I was there early for a private party before Industry Night kicked into full swing. 

A lot of Yelpers lamented about the price of drinks; hells bells, y'all, it's Vegas! What did you expect? Make a reservation for a table, order a bottle of Belvedere and just enjoy the ride! I was lucky enough to be here for a vendor event, so I never saw a tab, but can definitely say bottle service is the way to impress a lady.

That being said: show up to Marquee dressed to impress. You'll want to look your finest at this leading establishment. Gazing out over the balcony at the Sunset Strip in a cocktail dress and black suede pumps I felt ever-so-posh.

Around 11 p.m. the club was starting to pack out and I made my way over to the elevators. I was alone in Vegas since this was an event for work, and one of the hosts asked me why a girl like me was out at night by myself. When I explained I was in town for a conference, he gave me his card and said if I needed anything while I was in town to give him a call.

I was so impressed with the gentility (dare-I-say chivalry) of this kind host that I'll go ahead and give him a shout out: you are awesome Derrick! 

When I left Marquee the line was almost 1,000 people deep! I was in awe of my VIP treatment and am already looking forward to going back. Hopefully next time, I can enjoy Marquee to its fullest without having to get up and go to work the next day!",4,0,3

Can you say: UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ? yes, I've always wanted to start my review off like that! The sound of thumping noise! w00t

What makes this club stand out from the other places? Its kind of hard to say, but what I enjoyed the most was the DANCE FLOOR.  The LIGHTING and SMOKE effects helped create an amazing dancing experience.  I was *FIST* pumping all night! Sweat till you can't sweat no more, I say.

Wipe that sweat off your forehead and head to the PATIO.  Its more or less impressive at night (anyways).  Being that it was Winter, I was not able to enjoy the poolside much but it was nonetheless good to look at as well as the surrounding hotels with pretty glowing lights.  There's ample room to move about, so if you get tired of body bumping on the dance floor, definitely come out here to cool off before you gyrate like a lunatic again. 

One more thing to mention, there's a little stage out in the patio with a ginormous display that lets you peep into what's happening inside.

My lovely guests and I were on a guest list to their LIBRARY BAR which was a few flights up as you get past the Elevators.  Once you make it up the stairs and pass the bouncer, you are now inside a quaint bar that appears to look like a library.  And no, not like your local library, like a private home library inside a fancy home.  Hands down, a great secluded area to chill away from all that noise happening downstairs.  But if you want to checkout the action, there's a side door that allows you to stare down at the dance floor.

While all these things are great and fantastic, the most ""cray cray"" and annoying thing about Marquee was the stairway that you MUST take to depart the club.  It was long and luckily I do not wear heels! That's the only complaint I have.

If you have a crazy itch to get your dance on, I highly recommend coming here.  Happy UNTZ-ing!",10,10,11

When we get in we look around and it is like all guys.  This makes me even more pissed that we paid cover - they honestly should have been paying us for putting up for how aggressive these guys were being.  There were this glowing phallic tubes that some guys had, and actually whacked one of my friends with when dancing behind us.  The music was house and I'm a hip hop girl, but ok, I'll deal.

I'm a little biased, because Marquee was the first nightclub I ever went to. With stars in my eyes and blisters the size of marbles on my toes, I looked around in awe at what remains, in my eyes, as one of the best nightclubs in Vegas. 
It has an intimate feel, with so much to look at that you'll be dazzled. There's an upper platform above the stage where dancers strut their stuff, and an upper level of tables as well. Confetti rains, world-class DJs give Saudi princes birthday shout-outs: the usual Vegas glitz and glamour. But Marquee feels classy, despite all the gritty glitter. It smells nice, for god's sake. Everything is so well-executed that you lose yourself inside Marquee until you stumble out at 5 AM, shocking a family on their way to a sunrise tour of Hoover Dam (hypothetically, of course).",1,1,1

However, I was not impressed by a few quite important factors. But first, let's start with the positives: 
1. Located in the trendy Cosmopolitan 
2. Well crafted cocktails 
3. Higher standards for getting in yet quite feasible - I contacted the promoter Larson beforehand and got me and my bf on the guest list. After that, it's a typical girls on the guest list get in for free and guys on the guest list pay $50 cover. If you're not on the guest list, you can't get in. It's simply that packed and there's a huge line. 
4. Great DJs 

Here are the cons and the reason why Marquee is a solid 3 stars: 
1. CRAZY packed. I literally could not even dance on the dance floor let alone move my hand. Since people are so close to each other, drink spills are beyond commonplace. So expect to have cran-vod spills on your sexy Vegas clubbing attire
2. Very small. The venue is 3 stories with 1 floor for Hip Hop (where I spent most of my time), 1 floor for Electronic and 1 floor for Top 40s\/mashups. Each floor is extremely small with the Hip Hop floor as the smallest. The ""dance floor"" is so tiny that it's no wonder the place is so packed! When I go clubbing, I expect to dance my heart out. And there was simply no room or space to do that. 
3. The stairs from hell. Clearly the genius who designed this club could not have been a woman. To get from floor to floor, you have to walk up a flight of ridiculously high stairs and of course that equates to feet suicide for women.  

So yes, the music is great and yes, the club is trendy but unfortunately it falls short on a few important tenets that warrant a 4 or 5 star review.",3,3,2

It was pretty easy to find the place inside the hotel and easy to get in. Once inside, the bars were all easily accessible so it was easy to get drinks. There are 3 different rooms but I mostly stayed in the main room. 

What's crazy about this place was the SOUND SYSTEM. I think at one point of the night my ear hurt because of how loud the music was. Didn't bother me too much though because I'm used to it. The LED screen by the DJ had cool visuals and I think if I wasn't so drunk I would remember more awesome things about this place. My friend took a picture of these things hanging over the dance floor that spun with crazy lights... So LOOK UP when you are on the dance floor. 

It def can get crowded here but just move outside and there will be plenty of room to dance! Another plus is KASKADE is the resident DJ for a little while... If you go to one club in Vegas... GO HERE!",0,0,0

Every time I stay at Cosmopolitan I will be sure to stop by the Marquee Day Club for this sandwich.  The price is $22, but it is totally worth it and easy to split, so for $11 per person I see it as a good deal.  The sandwich comes with lobster, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, spicy mayo and comes with excellent seasoned fries.  

The bartenders also make excellent mojitos and painkillers (piña colada)!  Be ready to spend your money if you are looking to drink and eat though.  Specialty drinks are $12-$14.  You're on vacation, why not?

However since I go there so much, it would be redundant. I m going to post my most recently VIP reservation experience at Marquee. 

Going into the AOD End of Summer Invasion, I knew Marquee Nightclub was going to be one of the highlights of the trip. At the beginning there were about 25 people interested in getting VIP services at Marquee. As soon as we got the quotes back of $300-400 per head, it quickly eliminated the contestants in a hurry. So I ended up with a final total of 8, and the best I can do was a 5 person reservation at an outside table with my man Brad Spieser at the Marquee group. Even this was almost impossible to pull off because Marquee reservations were pretty much completely booked out for Fri\/Sat, for a few weekends to come. We had to be there nice and early, no slipping up. 

On early Friday we had a pretty chill pool party, and I made sure I didnt get chocolate wasted at Liquid. We got back to our room, and everyone was on point when we were getting ready. For the first time on this trip Gio\/Mike B got all dressed, and were actually ready for me to pimp them out with the double windsor knots on the ties. We were looking sharp we left the Signatures and even got offered limo rides. Nah, we roll gangsta. Cabs only. 

Got to the Chandlier bar at 8:45! We just had to wait for Ola, Chad and the rest of his crew. Thank goodness I brought a can of 4loko with me. So we were waiting for the crew to assemble, and I popped the can. Right away I took a huge ass sip. I handed off to Gio, hes like no thanks. Mike B also said no thanks. WTF. This meant I had to kill this whole can by myself. Either ways its Marquee, fuck it. We lay it all on the line. Slowly but surely I chugged the whole can. Rest of the crew appeared, I picked our select 5 on table. Collected the cash and off we went. The other 2 dudes had glist lined up with 12 girls, so they were to meet us inside. 

We took the escalator up to Marquee level and honestly I was seeing 30 ropes infront of me and I talked the guy that appeared to be in the middle. He said we had to wait an additional 10 mins before VIP line actually opened up. Apparently I was totally slurring my words cause Mike B said I was wasted and he still was polite with me. I was like calm down Mike B, even me wasted I can handle Vegas business with 110% efficiency. Thats how I roll, Major style.  So finally our guy Brad texts us back, hes waiting at the ropes. We quickly bring the crew up and he lifts the ropes, then off we go. Say good bye to the millions that are stuck on the other side of the club which have no idea that we take this secret elevator without ever being in line. 

In the elevator ride I persuade Brad to come drink with us, and sure enough he agreed. Slapped him with a huge tip for being a bro. So we go to the outside level of Marquee, Brad straight walked us to the center front dance floor daybed, right infront the screen with a sweet view of all the oncoming talent. Everyone was bro-hugging each other because all our hard work of planning this trip finally paid off. 

We order bottles, and the rest was pretty much history. Heres the bits and pieces of what I remembered:
-I was yelling at some random bouncer for picking up bottle serviced drink and disposing of it, and I was telling him how much it costs vs the bar, and he said he didnt give a shit
-I was making out and dry humping one of our friends and she was loving it on our daybed
-I shuffled like a madman, and somehow found my way at bungalo cabanas ( a good 100 yards from my daybed). Then some guy came back to our table and asked to have what I was having..

Just bits and pieces.. and many numbers in my phone when I left. I also remember the light show as incredible, and it was most banging house music I ever heard in my life outside of EDC. Oh Marquee, the next time we drop a couple of Gs we will try to remember it better.",4,10,5

The Cosmopolitan was very helpful to get me in contact with the right person to reserve a table. We had 8 girls so I didn't think this was going to be a problem. I just wanted this whole experience to be perfect and amazing for my sister. Sadly, it was not.
The woman I reserved the table with wanted us to show up at 10pm. If you have ever been to Vegas no one shows up at 10. Besides we had 10:30 dinner reservations. I told her I would come by around then and pay for the table just so they knew we were still planning on coming. From the initial meeting of the staff to the moment I left I felt very unimportant almost as if they went out of their way to make me feel this way. After one of the hostesses walked me to the area we would be in for the night she left me to pay which isn't a huge big deal, but it was such a process to exit the club I felt like she should have helped me get in and out of there quickly especially knowing I had 1030 reservations. After dinner I returned with my sister and her girlfriends in tow. We stood outside of the ropes looking like idiots while I tried to get the hostesses attention. Even after I told the bouncer we had a table and had already paid he shewed me like I was some little club rat giving him the come bang me eyes to let me in. I texted our hostess and she eventually came over to let us in. We then had to stand in line for another 15 mins while they let everyone else in America ahead of us. She told me that they have a different table for me which was fine but when I saw where it was I wanted to switch back to the other one. They sold that to someone else though. I made the best of it and just started having a great time. We shared the area with a bachelor party which seemed like good fun until they had over 30 people in their area over flowing into ours. Their guests also tried to drink off our bottles. I told our cocktail waitress and the bouncer and nothing was done. The club is beautiful, but the staff makes it ugly. We even had cabana reservations the next day and chose to go somewhere else. I will not give Marquee anymore of my money.",3,0,0

The Main room, where most of the big acts perform is smaller than I expected (the high ceilings can be deceptive!).  If you want to see that huge EDM dj at Marquee, get there early and stake your space on the dance floor or near one of the multiple bars, or book a table with a huge minimum. 

Marquee has three distinct floors each with its own type of music.  It you need a break from the pulsing music or snag a cutie from the dance floor and want to chat, make your way to the top floor's Library room.  Just be prepared to make the journey and grab drinks at the bar first.  You will have to wait in line for a packed elevator or hike up a flight of stairs to get there. 
 
Tip: Check out Monday nights at Marquee, it is still a busy night to see and be seen in Vegas, but Mondays avoid a little bit of the weekend overcrowding.  The crowd here is very good looking.  Dress to impress at Marquee, or let alone to get through the ropes in the first place!  Also grab dinner and drinks at STK first. It's where all the ""locals in the know"" nosh before Marquee.",1,0,0

I would think that the bouncers SHOULD know when their GA lines open up, or even have an idea of around what time it would.  

You walk in and get into an elevator.  The elevator takes you up to the actual club. 

Drinks inside was in a glass cup & a red bull vodka was $16.  However, my friend got a red bull vodka outside, which came in a taller plastic cup & cost $24.  Strange.  The bartenders were pretty nice though and hooked my other friend up quite a bit (he ended up getting quite drunk from the hook ups).  There's a few jacuzzis and a pool outside bc of the Marquee Dayclub in the day time.  There are also some cabanas w\/ tables and some poker tables outside as well. 

I needed a few bandaids bc i got cuts from my new heels so my friend went to go ask security for one.  I had to show the security my cuts in order to get a few bandaids.  He took me to the back area where first aid was waiting.  They took my info, put peroxide on my cuts, and gave me extra bandaids.  They were really really nice! 

The downside of this club is that in order to exit the club, you need to walk down six flights of stairs.  This is a balling club in a balling hotel and there's only one elevator to take you up.  I think they should invest in an escalator or another elevator or something.",0,0,1

First time, I was taunted by someone who worked there themselves. But that was easily forgiven. Second time was the last straw, a friend of mine was pulled to the side and told to give up her ID. I butted in and asked why, I'll provide privacy for the security individual but he said, "" She is clearly intoxicated and stumbling."" Which was a totally bogus reason. I asked the other security guards and had no idea either. The crowd I roll with never ever causes troubles, and usually buys a good amount of drinks providing business. But Marquee, you sure did mess up, and have lost a huge amount of customers. I suggest you review your security team, and stop getting muscle heads who have too much protein in their brains.

Moving forward from my rant, the facilities here are good. It is clean and there are bars EVERYWHERE. There are different ""rooms"" here and it is nice to step into another area and have a different genre of music and a different crowd of people.

Lastly what gives marquee such a low rating in my book is their poor poor layout. Seriously? Stairs? I know the ladies will have a hard time after a night of drunken dancing, safely walking down the stairs. Someone is bound to get hurt and probably sue.

I'd come back just for the rather large outdoor area, but the lines to get into the club are pretty ridiculous even if you know a promoter.",0,0,0

Marquee Nightclub - 2 stars

Where do I even begin?

I'll start out with what I like best about Marquee.  If you're going to check out Marquee, I definitely recommend going for the Dayclub.  Even though I've only been twice (once for Armin van Burin, who was uh-mazing), I love the ambience and decor of the place.  Definitely not as big as Encore Beach Club or Palms Pool Party, but I like the atmosphere and music much more.  I'm considering getting a table here for my birthday weekend :)

Sadly, that's the only great thing about Marquee.

I've been to the nightclub more than a handful of times to see ATB, Cosmic Gate, Markus Schulz, etc.  Was here during Halloween weekend, was here on Christmas Eve -_-  I can say out of all the times I've been here, I've had a good time only once.  Once!  Every other time has just been bad.  I don't know if this place is cursed or I have bad juju... but my friends and I have had pretty bad times here :(

The first time I went to the nightclub (Halloween weekend), one of the girls in my party pre-gamed a little too hard and we had difficulty getting past the bouncers.  One of my best girlfriends and I tried to sway the bouncers, but to no avail.  I ended up fighting with the bouncers (I had a little to drink too) and walked away in tears and frustration.  In the process, I lost more than half of my friends.  We all managed to find ways to get in separately, but it was just really frustrating and such a hassle to be in that situation.

Second time I went (to see Cosmic Gate), we went through the ""VIP"" entrance with the million flights of stairs.  Why do the VIPs get to go up the stairs and regular guest list people get the elevators?!  I don't understand this.  Anyway, because I hadn't drank water the entire day and had one mixed drink, by the time I reached the actual club, my heart was racing, I couldn't breathe, and I fainted.  I woke up on the floor next to the bar, was taken to the ladies' restroom and fainted in there as well.  By the time I woke up, I was told by the restroom attendent that the paramedics were coming.  They whisked me away in a wheelchair just as Cosmic Gate was performing my favorite song... :""(  They took me to this place where I guess all the medics take care of the injured and after fainting again in there, the medics said I was fainting due to dehydration and I was taken to the hospital.  It was a series of unfortunate events, but I believe if I never climbed those whack ass sets of stairs, I would've never fainted.

Times after that have definitely been a lot more chill for me, but when crazy stuff like that isn't happening at Marquee, this place is super packed.  The dance floor is a mess and it's a mission to get inside, and to get out.  I do like, however, that they blast air over the dance floor occasionally so it doesn't get as hot.  The music really depends on the DJ they have spinning, but on average, has been pretty good.

I would definitely come back since it's the place to be and if my favorite DJ is spinning there, how can I say no?  Is Marquee my favorite club in Vegas though?  Definitely not.  And if I could avoid it, I would.",6,8,3

Marquee really grew on me because it's pretty, has tons of bars, and a separate hip-hop room (Boom Boom Room). It can get really crowded, but that's typical of any Vegas nightclub. Because of my excellent promoter, I usually get a free table with round of drinks. Until someone actually buys the table, we can stay there and chill right by the dance floor. Ladies usually get open bar on Monday nights as well.

It's kind of funny that every single time I've gone, I've entered in a different way. They really make you work for it when they make you walk up and down the flights of steps. They should have better signs for that.

Oh yea, if you're going to get extremely intoxicated, watch out for security because they're really strict about it. Two of my friends have gotten kicked out; one ran away, but he eventually found her.",3,6,2

Ladies, you know what I'm talking about. Unless you've got someone willing to carry you up and down a few flights, stairs are not our friends, and Marquee has plenty of them.

The mix of the crowd here was a little strange... Saw someone who looked like my friends dad on the dance floor. He was just standing still in the middle of all the madness texting...

Maybe I'm nitpicking but I wasn't impressed by the restrooms here. They were kind of small and not too pretty.

It was impossible to get on the floor towards the end because Avicii was playing that night. We were fine hanging outside by the pool where we made friends with a couple guys who had bottle service. 

I liked the pool area a lot. I loved the jacuzzis next to the cabanas! Too bad we couldn't use them :( The outside area is spacious enough where you can get some air, yet small enough that you can walk around and socialize. Or in our case, dance in our seats while random guys gave us lap dances.",1,1,1

I say this because, it's too much walking to get anywhere around in the club. Let me get this straight, it's nice that it's perfectly spaced out, but during one of my visits, I had to climb a million of stairs, and that was just the entrance! Elevators were shut down that time around. Luckily, on another visit, I took an elevator up and that saved a lot of time. But boy, these stairs were a bit tricky. Too much focusing for a girl who's intoxicated, haha.

Also, they have a house\/techno floor and the bottom room would usually blast hip hop which was the perfect combo, until one night... Hip hop room was playing some good oldies my first visit. AND I definitely enjoyed that. But during my second visit, I heard the hip hop playing and by the time I got into the room (around midnight), they started to play MORE house music. We already had the top floor playing it, why should the second floor play it too? If I wanted house music, I would've walked to the top floor! The whole damn club had house music on so I definitely bounced from that club within an hour since I expected the hip hop room to be craccin out hip hop music all night. It didn't. I got tired of waiting for it to come back!

I think both dance floors should be bigger too. The hip hop room is ALWAYS, ALWAYS crowded. This club has a lot of lounge areas though. Which is the good part about this club. It gives a lot of areas where people can chill. Dancing AND lounging definitely do not mix in this club. THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE IN ALL CLUBS. I definitely hate sitting at a table, and less than a foot away some chick and dude are dry humping in my face. This club keeps the separation of the dance floor and tables perfectly apart. People shouldn't confuse the table area as a dance floor!

Oh, and I do like the fact that there are barely any lines in their bathroom AND they have hella bars to get your drinks from. PLUS!",1,1,0

We got there right when they were open and bought our tixs presale so we haD to head to the 3rd floor. Its through the glass elevator on the casino floor and up the escalator. The bouncers there were every nice to my husband and I. They directed where to go to get To The Club Line. Since we were the first ones in its actually another flight of stairs to the 5th floor. The bouncer was nice enough to warn me if we leave before 2am we had to take the stairs down 5 flights. We went into the hip hop room which is on the 5th floor and it was pretty small. Proly no bigger than the usual bars inside any of the Vegas casinos with a small maybe 15 x15 dance floor. We decided to check out the main room on the 6th floor since ferry corsten was djing that night. We bought an audios and a beer n it came out to be $23. Very expensive drinks given we could had got free drinks playing at the casino downstairs. We thought lines were going to be long from reviews but were so wrong. It wasn't until near 11pm when the crowd started. My husband bought a shot, another audios, and a grey goose with red bull for $50. He had used his credit card for this. (this will be a wrong decision later...stay reading to my review here.) We had a pretty good time there. We both danced the night away and didn't get anymore drinks given we didn't want to be drunk walking back to our hotel about 5 hotels north of marquee. We left around 2am-ish as we were able to take the elevator down. On Monday while leaving Vegas my husband receives a call from his bank saying there were suspicious activities on his account and that's how we found out marquee has charged 2 additional charges to his account. When it finally cleared today i gave marquee's accounting department a call to dispute that but was told normally they deal with the bank on this. I told the lady the bank asked us to call to dispute it. She said she was going to email me the transaction of which i gave her my email addy but have not since received the transaction. This is ridiculous but if the charges has already cleared my end and it happened 3 days ago the receipt should not be hard to provide. I've worked at a restaurant before and i know how it goes with credit card receipts. Going to call the bank again to let them know to credit me back for fraudulent charges. By the way the accounting lady gave me the info on the receipt of drinks i don't even drink as my fave is the audios. Over all the club is very impressive for the 3 stars but my concern was on the fraudulent charges. I wonder if i wasn't sober enough to remember everything what others who are drunk are getting charged and they get away with it. Tip for anyone going there use CASH. Thank goodness i did on my first bar order of the audios and beer...my bank card could have gone through the same thing as my husband's.",0,0,0

i came here just last weekend 3\/4\/11 & Dirty South was spinning

Tips: 1.) get there EARLY !! seriously the line starts forming around 830, we got there exactly at 9, and managed to get in the front of the line, easy entrance for girls, and it was free! $25 for guys since we were so early

2.) dress code - FANCYYY. my friend wore a blazer jacket but didn't have a dress shirt on the inside (such a noob move), just a regular shirt & they wouldn't let him in.  Also no tennis shoes at all...even if its all or 90% black, strictly dress shoes

3.) don't LOOK\/ACT\/SEEM drunk. they are nazi's about this, one slip and they kick you out.

otherwise, Marquee is a really nice club, has 3 stories, the main story where the dj spins has a spacious dance floor and banging speakers, perfect for those hands in the air moments :)

my favorite part of marquee is the outdoor area, really big, where the pool is and it over looks all the brightly lit vegas buildings around it, gives it a really nice ambiance, and it just so happens the weather was perfect when we went.

#1 likes about this club is, there are so many bars around, you never have to wait long to order a drink (unlike XS where it takes 1 hour just to reach the bar) at Marquee, the bartenders are nice & quick & no hassles around the bar. perfect !

really nice club, maybe not as flashy as XS but definantly a TOP 3 club you must go to in vegas!",3,0,0

It's almost as if the bouncers here are making an effort to treat you with disrespect. I understand that they must deal with plenty of craziness every night, but this certainly does not give them the right to treat their paying customers like children. 

My friends and I had paid for a table. As with all tables, there's a low-hanging rope delineator blocking off the private table area from the public common area. I had been sitting at the table, and I stepped over the rope to walk to the bar for another drink -- when the bouncer takes me by the arm and tells me that I'm not allowed to step over the rope; I have to go through the actual opening on the side. I think he's just giving me a warning, so I sincerely apologize and remove my arm from his grasp... He continues holding my arm, asks for my ID, and tells me I need to leave the club. When my friend chimes in to back me up, he takes her ID as well and leads us both out of the club -- refusing to acknowledge any of our arguments. 

If anything, I hope that the staff will someday understand that there are actually some reasonable people in the club. Sure, there are tons of people who deserve to be kicked out, but the staff needs to be able to tell the difference between the two -- and refrain from kicking out paying customers for petty reasons. When you can't even come up with a logical response to someone's reasoning, maybe they don't deserve to be removed from the club. 

The only reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because I always end up having a great time at Marquee as long as I'm not interacting with the staff. The venue is large and diverse, and though it's deathly crowded in some areas, you can always walk outside to get some air. So, thanks Marquee for kicking me out of a club! Now my friends all think I'm a total renegade, until I tell them that all I did was step over a rope from a private, paid-for table to a public space.",21,5,7

Thanks to a friend, our guys didn't have to pay a ridiculously high cover to get in (only $25 with guestlist access).  I've heard that prices can go as high as $50 - $80 a night.  Entering the club was a complicated process though; we started off in a long guestlist line when our grouop, including 15 other people were led by a security guard around the Chandelier Bar and up the escalators to yet another line.  After getting through that line, which started to feel like going through airport security, we were then led up a long flight of rickety stairs in some back woods part of the building.  (Given the mixture of alcohol and high heels, this is a liability waiting to happen).  By the time we reached a small doorway to enter the building, we already got quite a work out.  

Entrance fiasco aside, the club is pretty cool.  The sexy dark lighting, phrases like ""You down with OPP?"" lit up on the wall, and rooftop area is a great backdrop for a fun night out.  There are two packed floors of music playing, with the hip hop room on the first floor crammed and much smaller than the upstairs trance\/techno floor.  I can't comment on how good the hip hop music was because we could barely breathe in that room long enough to hear a song.  Grab a drink at the rooftop bar and you won't risk being trampled by the crowds.  That is, if you can survive the flight going down the stairs.",1,0,0

Came here this weekend for the Avicii pool party on Sunday. Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! It was an awesome day party. Very intimate space to dance to your favorite dj!

The line didn't seem very long but the guy working tried to discourage people by saying it would take an hour getting in. What a dick. He must have been sick of dealing with people for the day. Anyway, we got in less than 15 minutes. It was relatively cheap entrance for a pool party during a busy weekend. 

Girls, be careful in heels. Floor is extremely slippery even when not wet. I wear heels all the time but almost slipped because the finishing on the floor. I swear I wasn't drunk (not yet, anyway). 

The pool itself is pretty small and murky. There were pieces of mint everywhere. I'm guessing from mojitos spilled in the pool. There were plastic cups on the bottom of the pool floor too. Anyway, the music was great. The crowd was rowdy and fun. Everyone in the pool was splashing water when the music was going crazy. There were these little platforms in the pool that you could dance on. Made it look like you were dancing on the water. So awesome!

Drinks are normal Vegas prices which means expensive. So bring your plastic or lots of cash.

Going to into the Cosmopolitan was itself a pleasure to walk through. Valet parking is free so take advantage of that if you didn't know :). The wait to get inside the Marquee wasn't too long of a wait, but the fee to get in for guys is pretty high. So if you get a chance try and track a promoter down so you guys out there don't have to pay so much. But even with the reduced cost, it was still pricey. It costed my boyfriend $45 to get in and that was with VIP passes. I wouldn't want to imagine the regular cost to get in. Ladies are free from what I know, but most clubs usually allow girls to get in without any cost. 

Going inside the marquee was an adventure of its own. An elevator came down to bring us to the club and the boucner there was trying to get us pumped up before we got inside. That was really exciting! As soon as we got into the actually club, the music was jamming and people were already flooding to the dance floor to get moving. We decided to explore a bit and my favorite part of the club was the outdoor decor. There was a large swimming pool in middle with heated lamps along the side.
We also saw jacuzzis and female dancers dancing around the platform above it. 

Music there was most house, trance, electro, techno kind of music. Most of us didn't care for it, but we thought that was the only floor there until later notified by a friend that there was a another floor that had more main stream, hip hop music. DARN!! It was on the second floor i believe.

I came on a Saturday and the following Monday and they had slightly different decoration changes. Their ""go-go dancers"" behind the main DJ booth are always dressed in something Lady Gaga would wear which makes it fun and artistic and opposed to watching someone shake their butt around but they have those too. It's nice that they have a hip hop room for the non-electronic music folk. But do those kind of people even exist anymore? 

Cons? As you can read from the other reviews, it gets REALLY packed. Arrive 10pm if there's big name talent. You might still have to stand in a bit of a line. And you want to get into the little center space in front of the DJ before 11pm. But once you're in there, good luck trying to get out. Don't they have fire-safety rules for capacity?!

However, we love the Cosmopolitan and we'd heard good things about Marquee.  We had a pair of VIP passes to get into Marquee on the Monday night that we were in town, so in the interest of science and the spirit of adventure, we decided to check it out.  The cover charge is $20 per head on Monday nights.  I can't say with any certainty, but probably most of the people in the club on this particular night didn't pay this price.  The front of house staff and security were all business, but professional.  Of course, we were there relatively early in evening so, perhaps, the buffoonery doesn't start until later in the night\/morning.   

The club is a large, sprawling, multi-floored mecca of thumping beats and bodies in motion.  Each of the floors has a different theme\/vibe with hip-hop downstairs, a chill library\/billiard room upstairs, the main room\/dance floor with the dj and gyrating go-go dancers, and a beautiful pool area with private cabanas and a more relaxed feel.  From an aesthetic perspective, Marquee Nightclub looked classy and pretty damn impressive!  From an aural perspective, Marquee sounded and felt impressive as you could feel the driving bass give you a sonic beat down!  Drinks, as to be expected, weren't cheap.  My gin & tonic was a steep $15, but to her credit, the bartender made it a stiff one.  Marquee also has blackjack tables on near the pool area with comped drinks, made with the same strong pours, for players.  As luck would have it, a nice little run at the tables made for a very cheap night out at Marquee.  

Marquee does what it does very well.  I can't speak to what the place is like on the weekends, but I think I definitely prefer the Monday night scene, which seemed more geared to the locals than how I imagine the weekend would be when it's overrun by out of towners.  In truth, Marquee is exactly how I pictured a Vegas nightclub should be.",3,2,3

The night club was my first experience. The lines are way too long, the club itself is way too big, and there's literally NO WHERE to sit unless you buy bottle service and a table. And leaving at the end of the night?? Horrendous. It's a maze inside.

The day club on the other hand is SO much fun. We bought a daybed, and it comes with a line of credit--we had $750 to spend on all we wanted for food and drinks. It goes FAR.

The staff at the club (bouncers and bottle service guys as well as bussers) are all selling drugs and linked up with local organized crime. I watched as a bouncer and staff members stood and sanctioned a beat down on an ordinary person who was a little tipsey but harmless. The ordinary customer accidentally bumped into a local who was handing off drugs he was selling. He got in the ordinary person's face, and after the person apologized and tried to walk away he went after him again for no good reason and started hitting him then continued while he was on the ground. Several Marquis staff stood over and actually prevented others from stopping it. When I went and told a Cosmopolitan employee he wasn't surprised, said they had many of the same complaints, but that since Marquis is a third party venue with their own staff there was nothing they could do. The bouncers and staff also allow their local friends to sneak into your VIP area and steal bottles and take free drinks. They didn't kick one person out who had magically wandered into a VIP area and actually drank right from the champagne bottle. They very gently removed him and allowed him to stay. He later beat down the ordinary person.

While the club itself is gorgeous, with the nonsense described above and many better club options I won't be back ever, especially after the head of Cosmopolitan security explained what I mentioned. Hakkasan is better anyway.

Since this place is so popular, get a promoter to get your group in, it will make your time there go much more smoothly. We went in with a little uneven ratio, with one guy more, but it was still okay. 

IT can get pretty packed on the main dance floor since it isn't ridiculously large, but hey the music and the alcohol can make any place a good time.

I do give the place props for having an amazing outside area though. The lights, pool, and overall atmosphere really reminded me of a smaller version of XS. They did a really good job of keeping the girl to guy ratio high. Flocks of girls would be strolling into the club in the beginning. 

But seriously, is it REALLY necessary to have girls in 4-inch heels walk up 5 flights of stairs before being able to get into the club?? The design of the entrance was definitely not optimal, they could have had an elevator at least, and the stairs were the janky aluminum looking kinds they have in emergency stairways. My feet were killing me by the time I reached the first level of the club. Then of course you want to explore the rest of the club, so we ended up walking up 2 more flights of stairs to reach the top, so you could only imagine how much pain we were in.

Also, I think we came on a really bad night. ATB was playing, so the club was especially packed, not to mention that it was 97 degrees the entire night.

My friend and I are not ugly by any means and we were the best dressed out of most of the girls there. I dont care how bad it sounds the truth is the truth. We are from NYC and I work in the fashion industry so I know how to pull a showstopping outfit together.  People say it is ""diverse"" but if you call all Asian and white (or at least light in skin color) diverse you need to get out of your bubble more often. 

Doorman completely ignored my friend and I and kept going around us. I asked if there was a problem and he said no problem but refused to let us walk in.

Marquee- amazing when you get in and its not so packed but after awhile it gets wayyyyyyyyyyyy to packed. I understand that this is the newest nightclub and everyone wants to be here but come on its very overwhelming.

Pros: great music, gorgeous people

Cons: wayyyyyy to crowded, they block off the main floor, lots of different rooms you can hop around but its always super packed they definitely need to expand the hiphop room because hiphop is a staple in clubs also. You will lose people in the club and its not fun. The wait time because you have to go up the elevator and 1:1 ratio when you go to the club. Bouncers were yelling at girls how they needed a guy and everyones scrambling and Cover fee is super steap its ridiculous.

Last weekend, our group headed over to the club and hopped into the guest list line (each one of us put ourselves onto the Eventvibe list and even got email confirmations for it.) Out of 18 of us, not ONE of us were on the guest list for some odd unknown reason. Luckily, we had passes from promoters that took care of us, but I thought the whole website (that was legit, because we've used it before) was a little disorganized and confusing to say the least. Also, it seems like they changed their entry lines when before, certain guest lists were located on different floors, and then last weekend, the bouncers told us there is only one guest list now. After the whole guest list fiasco, we left to pre-party in our room and when we returned, we were sent off on a wild goose chase by different bouncers to find the re-entry for the club! Actually, that might have been the funnest part of the night. Once we were in, it was claustrophobia to the nth degree. In my opinion, they should switch the hip hop room to the main floor every so often but again, that's just me... Great if you're into EDM and all, but I most definitely am not... =\",5,5,2

I really wanted to try this place since I had heard so many good things about it, so I got in line at 1:00am and patiently waited an hour to get in, which actually wasn't bad since my friends and I were cracking jokes with the bouncers and they were letting us go in and out of line to eat and drink (we had a 1:1 ratio so I knew we weren't going to get to cut in line unless we bribed the bouncers and I don't bribe for sh*t; I'll wait, thanks).  Cover is $20 girls\/$30 guys.  

The actual club is pretty huge.  The main trance\/house floor is the largest floor and sooo awesome!  When I go to a club, I actually like to dance to trance\/house stuff more than hip-hop, so I was loving this.  The electronic display\/go-go girl dance space behind the DJ booth was pretty cool and so was the freaking cold blasts of air that would randomly hit the dance floor!  It was much appreciated after dancing up a storm.

The upstairs room was small and played old school hip-hop, but what I like most about this floor is that if you go through one of the hallways on the other side of the floor, there are chairs and couches you can sit on!  Yay for free seating in a packed club!

The downstairs hip-hop room was pretty good too, but it really needs A\/C or something because I almost passed out from the heat.  Luckily there's the smoking patio just outside where you can step out for fresh air.

I'm not sure what the complaints are about the stairs since my girls and I didn't walk up\/down more than 2 steps inside the club. There are elevators that take you up and down to the club. 

Anyway, right when we walked in, we were all amazed. It was absolutely gorgeous inside with a spacious dance floor, plenty of bars and various other rooms. The outside pool area was amazing as well with great views of the surrounding hotels (Planet Hollywood) since Marquee is elevated. I was so excited when the DJ was spinning hip hop since XS played ALL techno the nite before. 

DJ Vice spun in the main room (he mixed hip hop with techno) inside and he was off the hook. He got everyone so amped up and rocked the place. Everyone was dancing their asses off and there was the energy in the room was insane! They also had a guy dressed as Jack (Jack-in-the-Box) and he was handing out large styrofoam ""glow sticks"" to people. There was also a guy throwing out dollar bills and was ""making it rain.

We had a really, really great time there and I definitely want to go back the next time we visit. It definitely lives up to its hype as being the hottest club in Vegas (sorry XS).

Yes, the STAIRS.

First of all, to even get to the club, you have to go up maybe 4 flights of escalators to make it to the club entrance.  Alright, no big deal.

Then, you'll have to wait in line.  If you're on the ladies' guestlist, it's maybe a 10-15 minute wait.  No problem.  

Finally get your ID checked and your wrist stamped, and then you're led into this stark white corridor featuring what looks like a torturous flight to heaven.  Yes, stairs, stairs, and stairs.  And more stairs.  These are fire escape stairs too, so imagine the clack, clack, clack.  After the FOURTH flight, I started to get a little belligerent in my 5"" heels.  But we finally got there.

First floor.  Hip hop.  Douchey, sweaty people.

MORE STAIRS

Second floor.  House music. The elevators were blocked off by a burly man who wouldn't let anyone use it.  I'm surprised I didn't kick him in the nuts.  Oh yeah.  It's probably because my feet were aching from the treacherous hike in 5"" heels.  Outdoor pool area was pretty cool.  Okay, it was pretty breathtaking.  But, still:

MORE STAIRS

Third floor.  Harry Potter-type library setting where the cocktail waitresses dressed like slutty library nerds.  It was quite awesome if you ask me.  This was worth upping this review by 1 star.

Time to exit the club.  Guess what?  

MORE STAIRS (?!)

Marquee at the Cosmopolitan was a disappointment. We show up (three of us: male, male, female) and talked to one of bouncers who informs us that we can get in without being a guest at the hotel. We get redirected to a different line and  then we are told to go back to the same line we just came from. After a few more shuffles and false claims we are told, ""You guys can get in since you have the lady and I need a $100."" We had no problem paying a cover charge at the very beginning if they had just told us that. However, after experiencing their line game, we felt that the club's bouncers were untrustworthy.",1,0,0

I have only been at night (a few times), so I have nothing to speak to regarding the day club except for that fact that it has to be just as awesome, if not more awesome (since you can swim). They don't allow you to get near the pools when it is a nightclub, so don't try or else you'll get thrown out (have seen this happen). If you have a suite in The Cosmo, your balcony will lead straight to this club.

Marquee is located in The Cosmo (Cosmopolitan) and right in the center of the strip (next to Bellagio and the Monte Carlo). Great location! This place is SO BIG and has MANY LEVELS\/AREAS, but despite this fact, it is always busy. Busy in the GOOD WAY. Not busy to where you can't move without touching someone. (Ew!)

Great DJs, awesome music, fun atmosphere, variety of levels\/areas to appeal to many tastes, plenty of bars, and all the good stuff. There is a bar called The Library, on the bottom floor. It's more quite there and intimate so if you don't really like clubs but your friends do, this is a good place to retire to. It's a bar inside a club, as I said appeals to all tastes.

My girls and I got in for free because I know a host and had open bar for an hour. BUT I have known people to have trouble getting in. When we leave, there is usually still a line of people trying to get in. For guys, I know you have a better chance of getting in if you have a bunch of girls with you.

Imagine the cockpit of an alien spacecraft, that is basically what the main DJ stage resembles. They open the Dayclub at night so you can get a breath of fresh air. They have random smaller bars off the elevators and some on each side of the main stage.

It was really nice to see they had Amstel light for $9, and other high end drinks for $13 (not bad) Plus, they GIVE YOU FREE WATER. Surrender and Haze nightclub charged $8 for a bottle of water. It was really nice to see all the bartenders were cool with keeping Hydrated.

We saw W&W here and they handed out orange glow sticks to everyone which was pretty cool. All of the light, smoke, confetti were nicely coordinated with the songs. So far, best club experience in Las Vegas, although I have not been to XS or Hakkasan yet.

Make sure you bring cash with you though, because you can get into the main circle near the DJ's but you have to give the bouncers $20. Not bad for getting VIP seats without paying bottle service. I will be back.",3,0,0

Nikki sent me a message about a Hello Kitty event. So, I met up with another friend, went here a bit before 10pm, skipped the line, got our drink on...open bar FTW! We had as much Veuve, Dom Perignon, Hennessy and vodka our liver allowed us to have. Thank you, Louis Vuitton!

What's funny was that nobody seemed to know what the Hello Kitty event was about and where exactly it was happening. But we know it was happening since we saw a few girls in HK garb. We walked outside at the cabana\/pool area - nothing. We went upstairs to the library - nothing. Nikki and I (well, and my guy friend too since he had no choice) were on a mission to be one of the first 25 people there so we can get HK goodies. When we finally found the right spot, we all got our gift: HK bracelet and a HK mug, yay! They were also selling HK Philippines tote bags to benefit typhoon victims.

Marquee happens to be the ""it"" spot right now for Vegas and I can't disagree.  This place is just amazing.  From the entrance to the exit, its insane with a touch of class.

Getting into the club, there's separate lines for guys and girls.  As always, entrance is pretty much at the discretion of the bouncer\/promoter.  If you don't have bottle service or know someone...expect to get in line early but even then there's no guarantee that you'll get in.  There were 8 of us (all guys)...so the obvious choice is to get bottle service.  $2k minimum for a cabana with 8 guys is a pretty reasonable price.  

Looking back, definitely a good choice going with a cabana instead of the main room.  Nice spacious area outside right next to the pool and you can actually hold a conversation with people instead of the inside area where its loud as hell that you couldn't even hear a nuclear bomb going off if you tried.  Our server and hostess were on point, everything was restocked when it needed to be and they were checking up with us constantly.  Awesome service!  Could not have asked for better.

As for the club itself, the main room is pretty crazy.  You'll have to pretty much force yourself through people to take a few steps but that's to be expected in a Vegas club.  With all those people, you'd think that it'd be scorching hot inside the club but that wasn't the case at all with Marquee.  They have A\/C and they know how to use it.  It actually felt cooler inside the club than it did outside.  How many times does that happen inside a club?  Uhh....never!  There's also a hip hop room downstairs which isn't too bad.  Obviously not as big as the main room but plenty of space to shake yo' tailfeather.

Overall, this is a great club.  Bottle service is definitely the way to go if you can afford it, otherwise you're looking to get in line pretty damn early.  If clubbing is on your agenda for Vegas, then Marquee is a must!",2,0,1

I understand people have to be processed and you have to put on the 'show' at the door, but come on, do you have to be a douchebag about it? And being a guest in the Cosmopolitan that experience reflects poorly. Door guy asked my friend to change his stylish T. Without incident he went upstairs and changed. Door guy said he'd get us right in. We get back door guy takes us to a point and drops us off and those guys tell us to go to the end of the line. At this point, I'm done.

Just when I thought nothing could get better than XS....here comes Marquee!!  Came here on a Saturday night to see Steve Angello (Swedish House Mafia) spin, and it was awesommmmeeee.  I REALLY think nothing can top this club now, haha. 

This is the newest club and hotel to hit the strip in Vegas and seriously, nothing comes close to topping Marquee AND the new Cosmopolitan hotel. You get to walk through the gorgeous hotel and up the escalators too the huge entrance area of the club.  The guestlist lines get insanely long, so I can't imagine how long the general admission lines are.  Saturday nights are ridiculously slammed so always use a promoter if you can.  Obviously with all girls you will be walked right in...sorry to say but if you have guys in your group, you WILL wait at least an hour in line.

Got there at 9pm and had no problem getting in, you take an elevator up a level and you are greeted by a bar as soon as the doors open.  The promoters and doormen are awesome here. Really organized, efficient, and they definitely have it together here.  If anything, your party should just go super early, get your stamp, and come back later...the re-entry line is super fast.

The awesome thing about this club is the different areas\/levels that you can go too. The main dance floor is a lot smaller than XS, but its just as beautiful and fun...like any other club it gets ridiculously packed, but hey when you're drunk, who the hell cares.  

I LOVE that you can see the DJ booth in the center stage, it always makes the party more fun when you can see who's spinning.  There's a huge 40 foot LED screen behind the booth too which is awesome.  

Definitely check out all 3 areas of the club!!! The main room spins house\/electro all night since that's where the resident DJs and guest DJs always come out. While the Boombox, which is a level downstairs, plays all hiphop\/rap music for all you dirty clubbers, with its own separate bar and DJ. While the Library is a nice intimate loungey area with pool tables and lots of tables.  And to top it all off there is a huuuge outside patio area with sofas, more bars, the pool, and an incredible view of the strip.  And the bartenders make drinks extra stiff =).  I can go on and on about this place.

But my top 3 pros for this place:

1. Great service, music, and people
2. There are a ton of bars so you never have to wait too long to get a drink
3. Beautiful hotel, people, and decor. 

This has got to be the world's longest review, but I will finish by saying, this place is a MUST VISIT the next time you are in Vegas! It was the first time in a long time that I stayed out til 3am..and I got there at 9pm! Even when I left at 3am the lines were still super long.

Drinks are expensive, weak, and small, so drink before you come. It gets so crowded because it's so small inside so most people are outside just standing around.

We made reservations for my sister's 30th birthday MONTHS prior to this weekend, and the club had no record of it at all. We were gonna get a couple of bottles and a cabana, the whole 9. However, the club came through and we finally had a table. It was nicely situated but it was difficult to make sure people who were not in our party did not sit at our bed thing or drink our drinks. Thankfully Jameel and Risa were so supportive and totally on our side. They helped us get rid of the free-loaders and provided excellent service. This was the only time at the Cosmopolitan we actually had good service. Money apparently doesn't mean anything anymore, so I was very grateful that Jameel and Risa came through and provided us with a wonderful evening. 

As far as the club goes, what is with the insane maze? That stairwell to get down to the Boom Box Room is a death trap! The main dj as with all the clubs in Vegas is that same techno crap, but the hip hip room was alright. I'm very impressed that I did not fall, but I did get lost numerous times.

Marquee is similar to XS. The layout is similar - circular with tables surrounding the dance floor. Like XS, Marquee also has an outdoor pool area. However, XS is more spacious and more hmm... I guess posh is the correct word.

If you like hip-hop, you can chill in the outdoor area. 
I was surprised that they had tables outside - my friend ended up playing the night away.

The point of the place is supposed to be to have fun but the entire layout is a scheme to make sure you don't have a damn bit of fun unless you pay four or five figures for a place to sit. You literally pay them thousands of dollars for the privileged of parking your ass. And then there's the lines. Line to buy a ticket, line to get on the elevator, line to go in, lines at the bar, lines at the toilets. And when you're sick of all the lines and you just want to get out, guess what? Bam! One more line, just to exit the damn place!

All the trouble might be worth it if there were something interesting about the pool area itself, but there just isn't. It's a cement hole that goes 3 1\/2 feet deep and has tacky fake palm trees around it. I've seen nicer pools in apartment complexes.

There are multiple levels\/rooms of dance floors - the boom boom room (hip hop), the main room  EDM music and the poolside is mixture of EDM\/hip hop.

I haven't been here in awhile, but definitely still a great spot to party it up. I went to Hakkasan a few months back and I still like Marquee more. It's nice that there's a hip hop room and a main floor which plays house music. The night I went the hip hop room was definitely bumpin' and it wasn't ""ghetto"" music, but more along the lines of top 40. Another good thing about Marquee is they have multiple outside areas, which most other clubs lack. These areas are the pool area near the main floor and the side area next to the hip hop room, which are nice for those who need a breath of fresh air and let some of that sweat dry off.  Surprisingly it wasn't super crowded for a Friday night like most clubs on the strip. That is the worse experience when you're trying to enjoy dancing and you can't even move because of the crowdedness. Drink prices are a bit steep considering I paid $36 for 2 red bull and vodkas, worst part is the bartender didn't bother asking me what type of vodka to use therefore automatically giving me the pricer one. I know for a fact that he served me the more expensive one because my friend who is a female only paid $32 for the same thing. Another downer is one of my experiences with a promoter. This past summer I tried getting my group on the Marquee guest list and the promoter asked me to send a picture of each girl in my group, really...?!

The main points (I wrote a long description, but no space so here is the summary):

1. Been there 3 times. (I'd been there 2 times in the past before this last Saturday featuring DJ Kaskade. My comments are valid for all times with particular emphasize on this last visit.)

2. Too expensive. ($80 per person is the most expensive club entry fee I've ever experienced in my life.)

3. Too crowded. (people are let in even though there is no space to move inside, particularly around the dance floor.)

4. Because of 3., the dance floor is ""closed"" right after the real party begins (around 12am). (guards block all alleys to the dance floor and prevent people from entering)

5. Because of 4., party groups can be separated. (Had anyone from my party remained on the dance floor after we decided to go to the restroom, we would have not been allowed to join them!)

6. Some of the guards are quite arrogant (but others are very professional and polite). (we spent 2 hours trying to enter the dance floor and were greeted with ""Move!"", ""Don't care about you!"", ""You are nobody!"", ""Don't talk to me!"", etc phrases by some of the guards)

7. There is no spot whatsoever you can occupy inside (unless you have a table). (you have two options: 1. to circle constantly around like an idiotic headless chicken back and forth since guards require you to always move or 2. go out to the patio and pool area and freeze by standing up (cause the music from inside is barely hearable there)

8. You can be easily kicked out of the club just by saying ""Boooo.."" to a guard. (we were almost kicked out in a situation in which we stopped for 20 seconds to discuss what to do, but we were not allowed to since we had to constantly move and I frustratedly said ""WTF! I did not pay this money and bought these drinks to constantly move and circle around and not be able to access the dance floor, listen to the music, enjoy the light effects and dance"". Thankfully, his advisor got very quickly the situation in control and did not believe this guard's lies.)

9. Even if you enter very early, you may not be able to enjoy the night on the dance floor anymore once you decide to go to pee. (we entered at 9:47pm, went to the restroom at around 11pm and were not able to get back on the dance floor until about after 3:30am. Hence, we missed the confetti, cool light effects, best dance rhythms. etc)

10. Too many Asians. (sorry, a fact.)

11. The dance floor is actually small for the size of the whole club and for the expected crowd! Architects and designers, what did you think?!

12. Bartenders don't make complicated cocktails (old-fashioned, for example).

13. You are served straight-up whiskey in a ... large plastic cup for water! You barely see the whiskey on the bottom!

The positives are:
a) the music and DJ was great (but why would you care if you cannot enjoy it!)
b) the atmosphere and settings are cool (but who cares if you cannot enjoy them!)
c) there are many girls until 12am (since they enter for free) and many of them are hot.

Marquee, if we pay $80 per person, enter at 9:47pm, buy a lot of drinks, we have certain expectations. Some of them are: to be able to drink somewhere while enjoying the music, to be able to dance, to be able to see the light show and screen, to be served whiskey in glass, to be treated with respect, to be able to walk without hitting a person every second, to be able to occupy a spot inside without constanly being kicked out or told by your guards ""Move!"".",3,0,0

Not to mention the line gets held up once again because you get crammed into an elevator to get to the actual club area. (Clubs that require elevators deserve their own rant. Such a mess).

2. The ""Clientele"" - So-Cal college kids on spring\/summer break. i.e. Girls in cheap Wet Seal freakum dresses and tired ""hidden pump"" heels and douchey ""bros"" in whatever they think makes them look rich. Basically giant groups of people who have no business pretending to be wealthy cause we all know they're staying 6 to a room at the giant cigarette known as Circus Circus.

3. The Stairs - This place is where they should shoot the next P90X video cause you will burn at least half of your muffin top off while trying to maneuver the chaos that is the floorplan. There are a few different dance floors, each one playing a different genre of music, which is cool. However, you have to climb up and down flights of stairs to get to each different section of the club. Drunks in heels + stairs = liability insurance nightmare. Also, traffic jams and feet being stepped on by said drunks in heels.

4. The Vibe - People don't come here to dance, they come here to feel cool. If you enjoy walking in circles through a club that's too small and too crowded, this is your place. People just stand around and text and there's very few places to sit or stand without being pushed or knocked in to. It's a hot mess and you're ready to leave in 20 minutes because you are bored and exhausted already. 

Being a local and a girl, I got in for free. I can't imagine paying to get into this over-hyped catastrophe.",1,7,0

Let's start that it's better to get your tickets online (women $20, men $50), rather than wait in a very long line and possibly not make it in.  Now that you are in, what to do?  Well, you climb stairs of course.  I'm finding this is a theme for many of the clubs, Marquee isn't the only one....Hakkasan!!!

What I did like about this club was the different rooms you can pick and choose from.  They had the main EDM room with your special guest DJ, other room has hip hop, top floor is the library room, pumping out the live EDM music, and the outside patio area with gambling dealers wearing bra tops.  Only in Vegas.

Bathrooms are a little hard to find, but once you do, overall clean.  They are located outside past the gambling tables.

If you enjoy going to a club, check it out.  Just be warned that we were in the wrong place at the wrong time.  While walking the main EDM floor, Kaskade decides it's time to come on, thanks Kaskade...not!  We got swarmed by tons of people.  I couldn't move or breath, I was on the verge of passing out.  Try to stay away from the middle when the main talent goes on.  We didn't know???  Never again.  Once we were able to crawl our way out of that, I enjoyed the club so much more.",3,2,1

Kalila and I went for my friend Sam's birthday on a Monday night. ""Marquee Monday"" is party rock themed. Go dressed in either ""party rock"" attire or semi-casual.

""Party Rock"" attire involves anything the guys from LMFAO would wear. Giant afros, big framed glasses, anything neon & bright, anything animal print, anything fur.

This place was absolutely PACKED. It was hard to walk around and hard to dance, but that doesn't stop people from having themselves a great time. Being bumped into is a normal part of nightlife. Marquee is definitely doing something right if they can fill their entire place up on a MONDAY. They have a great thing going for them with their alliteration.

They have 3 different floors. I only got to go to 2 floors. There was a party rock floor with all EDM (electric dance music) and ""The Boombox"" with all hip-hop music.

Ladies, this place is full of stairs. No effin joke. And not the carpeted nice ones through some pretty well designed hall way or anything .. they are the 'coming in the back way, metal' kind of stairs. 

Last time I went, we had VIP entrance which was cool cause we didnt have to wait in line.. which is always lovely. The bathrooms are almost a whole other mission to get to. Place is super crowded.

On Easter weekend, it was packed so I can only imagine what it'll be like over the summer. The venue is pretty but not as elaborate as the Cosmopolitan nor themed like The Tao Group's other properties: Tao + Lavo. Its multi-faceted design with 3 separate areas + an outdoor patio caters to clientele with different tastes who want to party all night to the 6am closing time. Love the lighting effects + the ease of finding a corner to sit + rest my weary feet without having to get table service, but what kills it is the STAIRS! And I don't mean 1 pretty flight of stairs spiraling between 2 levels like at Tao or Pure... I mean the narrow, dark stairways (hidden if not for signage like this http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/WUq8HJHIZU4uteB154XN7w?select=c_NyhX9Rsg-o9jy-SZ2XRQ at the back of the club) that you have to climb to get between the 3 areas on 3 different levels. 

* Location - While the club itself it on floors 5-7 of Cosmopolitan, the entrance http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/WUq8HJHIZU4uteB154XN7w?select=2UXu2vtfFG_hxAXQWoqkkw is on the ground floor between The Chandelier + Queue Bar.  

* Parking - The Eastern parking garage is the closer than the Western side, but the Western has valet. Self-parking is free. 

* Venue - Huge club designed like a maze with dark corridors + multiple stairways. The 3 areas split onto 3 different floors are the Boombox Room on the 5th floor, Main Room + outdoor pool patio on the 6th floor + the Library on the 7th floor. Each has a different vibe from the music to the decor + from the seating to the lighting ambiance. With an epic amount of stairs separating each level, we primarily stayed on the 6th floor for its large dance floor with 40' LED screen behind the DJ booth + the outdoor patio http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/WUq8HJHIZU4uteB154XN7w?select=FGSaWfN5tIurdh_zuVg8rA. The Library is a pretty chill spot with books in shelves along the walls + a fireplace http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/WUq8HJHIZU4uteB154XN7w?select=CJOxBoirLSOv3OLYXC2WaA. From the balcony, you can get a pretty cool view of the Main Room dance floor down below http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/WUq8HJHIZU4uteB154XN7w?select=0nz-CQ2uYRMVjpAbi-JrNQ. We avoided the Boombox Room because it made us claustrophobic after just attempting to get on the dance floor.

* Cleanliness - Quite clean bc it's still new... but by 5am when the crowd on the dance floor thinned out, I could tell the cleaning crew were getting sloppy as there were empty glasses on tables + random crap tucked into corners on the floor.

* Crowd - It looks to me like the trend-setters have migrated from XS + Surrender to Marquee. In mid-April when it's still a bit too cold to be at the aforementioned predominately outdoor clubs, the young + hip are here for the best of both worlds.   

* Music - As mentioned, the rooms on each level have different vibes + thus a completely different music experience. Gone are the days of hip-hop + top 40's dominating the dance floor as that genre is delegated to the small, overcrowded Boombox Room.  The Main Room + the outdoor patio feature house\/edm DJ's while the Library is a mix of oldies, funk + mellow jams I didn't particularly care for. To each their own.    

* Bar - 7 bars total throughout the venue so the wait isn't nearly that bad except in the overpacked Boombox room. The outside bartenders + table hostesses had on these adorable purple little eskimo dresses + boots. I wish I could have stole one of their outfits.  

* Drinks - I haven't had to pay for a drink here... but expect pricing ~$15 for shots or cocktails for a decent drink. On the high side for Vegas pricing indeed.   

* Bathroom - Plenty of bathrooms, yesssss! No signage so ask the bouncers for directions, but each level has at least 1 so we never had to wait for more than just a few girls ahead of me. I was very amused to note, though, that the GUYS bathroom behind the outdoor patio bar had a line of 10+ nearly all night, ahahaha!  

* Price - As always GET IN CONTACT WITH A PROMOTER! Girls have no excuse whining about having to wait in line or pay cover if they don't make the effort to get a hook-up. With our promoter, we were walked right up to the door, + yes, it was the 2 longest flights of stairs in my life just to get to the lowest level of Marquee, but we were in free in less than 5 mins. Done deal.  


By the end of the night, the staff closes off the Library, outdoor patio  + Boombox room so that the crazy party people still there until 6am are left in the Main Room. Thank goodness, they let us take the elevators down to exit the club rather than having to trot down a zillion more stairs... no wonder some girls thought to wear flats.

I have been to Marquee a couple of times now, both for the pool party and the nightclub. It's been pretty standard mid-to-upscale Vegas fare, and there's been nothing remarkable about it for me until this last visit. 

We were in a small group of women there for the dayclub on a guest list. We were waiting in a long line, which is to be expected. What was unexpected, however, was the completely outrageous rudeness and audacious power-tripping of one of the staff who was ""helping"" the line move along. His role was to get people to discard their outside drinks before they got in. Ok I get it, obviously we can't be bringing outside drinks into their dayclub. Not a problem. What IS a problem though, is how this person, who went by DJ, went about doing his job. This guy DJ is walking down the line bellowing at us all to throw our things away (""I didn't say finish,"" he screamed at the zealous group in front of us trying to guzzle their bottled drinks, ""I said THROW AWAY!""), and, though startled, we obliged by tossing the alcoholic bottled bevs we'd been sippin on into his giant rolling trash bin. But one of my friends was drinking from her water bottle to get hydrated before spending more time in the sun, after walking the strip for about 30 minutes. Though my friend attempted to tell DJ it was only water and that he could check it, he literally swiped it out of her hand as she was trying to take a last sip. What kinda BS...? He then justified his action by snapping, ""We have plenty of water inside. If you don't like it, go somewhere else"". We still had 15-20 minutes before getting to the actual club. Why couldn't she finish her water?

What added insult to injury was that when at the pool, we happened to be sitting near a group of guys on a daybed. We witnessed them (not-so) discreetly passing pills to each other and taking those pills. I'm pretty sure they weren't popping vitamins on their daybed. So, excellent job, security. 

That incident really soured the beginning of our afternoon, but luckily the pool was still mostly fun. Drinks were, expectedly, on the pricey side. One standout from their cocktail menu was the strawberry cooler, which I want to go make for myself on hot afternoons now. 

The bottom line is, these events are supposed to be fun and relaxed. We weren't trying to cause a problem; my friend was just trying to drink water, which the staff should be encouraging in the midst of all the wasted idiots they have to deal with. Borderline-assaultive individuals like DJ need to quit being so bitter and taking out their pent-up frustration on guests.",7,2,0

Marquee is the worst of what you think of when people describe Las Vegas Night clubs. Most of the bouncing and line staff are just dicks. This is the kind of place who hires doormen who really get off on what little power they have in their lives.

There were crazy lines, prices on tables switched every 15 minutes, and my group got the run around - you know the usual ""oh you've got to talk to so and so"" and ""I don't think she's working tonight b.s."" Whatevs, it's Vegas, I understand that it is douche bag mecca.

The real problem came once my friends and I actually got inside. I figured after all of the b.s. and the runaround and the big fucking deal the doormen were making this place HAD to be the shit. 

We get inside, fight our way to the dance floor (which also had separate bouncers keeping people off of it - yup, you read that right even after getting into the club there are bouncers waiting to keep you off of the dance floor) and I am shocked to see the overflowing sausage fest spilling out of the dance floor.

After all the exclusivity pretense - trust me I live in L.A. I'm used to that bullshit - I finally get into the place and it is 70% dudes - busted dudes at that - on the dance floor, awkwardly grinding on each other, leering at the one or two unattached women on the floor. I left 1 Oak for this shit! Are you serious?

I had been hearing all this garbage about Marquee being the number one rated nightclub and blah blah blah. I guess folks in Las Vegas buy that shit because there were plenty of people lined up to shell out their cash in this bullshit, promoter-created, artificial club. 

I went to XS literally the night before. It was not even comparable. At XS on a random Monday night in March, Lil John was DJ-ing, the crowd was hype as shit, and there was absolutely no bullshit. When I next go to Vegas I will be skipping this douche factory.",10,10,6

Before  Around 11-12 pm it got really packed, so dancing could get a bit annoying when everyone around is pushing you. Drinks are quite expensive, around 20$ for basics (gin&tonic etc), however amazing soundsystem and visualizations make up for it.

The Bad: 
 - The bouncers and the Doormen are assholes. They think they own the place and  are total douchebags. They made us stand for half hour and they were letting others in who were bribing them. Totally not acceptable! They had no courtesy for hotel guests, which makes it a bit more annoying.

However Marquee is not one of those places. It's a little smaller than some other clubs (e.g. Hakkasan, Omnia ugh) but it has enough room to move around and breathe. Whenever I've gone, the day club area is opened up and people can sit wherever, even the areas reserved for bottle service. The day club area plays hip hop, whereas the main club plays EDM. I enjoy both areas.

Almost every time I've gone, open bar is offered for ladies between 1030 and 1130. But show up too late, and it's full price.

The first time around, I waited for two hours in the ""Table Add-On"" line. It was miserable... But I'm a pretty patient dude, and I had a good time watching obnoxious brohammers wave hundred dollar bills in front of the doormen and get shut down.

Furthermore, by the time I got in, it was incredible. As luck would have it, I wound up at a dance floor table for Kaskade--probably an $8,000 or $10,000 minimum--that I didn't have to pay for. I realize that this can't happen to everyone--well, girls, it can probably happen to you--but I can only rate my own experiences.

The second time, determined not to wait in line (and not buying a table), I showed up as soon as the doors opened... Literally. I was inside the club at 8:50 PM on the Saturday of Labor Day Weekend when Avicii played. I know what you're thinking, and the answer is: Yes! It was pretty lame waiting around for three hours for things to pick up. But in the end--just like with waiting in that God-forsaken ""Table Add-On"" line--it was worth it.

BOTTOM LINE: If you're into house\/trance\/electro... Marquee is the place to be. Vegas has plenty of other fantastic clubs... But keep in mind that Marquee is the only one to be built with EDM in mind. All the rest were built when Vegas was still a hip hop town. The music, the lights, the smoke cannons... It all comes together at Marquee to make for an unforgettable experience. There's no better place in Vegas (America? The World?) to see your favorite DJ.

PROTIP: Avoid the ""Table Add-On"" line at all costs. If you're getting a table, have your entire group show up at the same time. The thing about the Add-On line is that the people standing in it don't represent  new money... Your bottles are already paid for, and you're not going to the bar. In other words, there's no incentive to let you in quickly. Avoid, avoid, avoid!",5,0,1

Club photos that I don't remember being taken that will never grace a social media page, because yeegads, they're not flattering to me at all (though my companions look gorgeous!).

For a newbie on the club scene in Vegas, Arty @ Marquee was an amazing experience. It wasn't ever so crowded that we couldn't move, or were so packed in that it felt suffocating. Maybe Saturday nights are crazier than Friday nights? It's bigger than it looks, with the hip hop room being down a flight of stairs and tucked away. Plus there's an outdoor area to relax from the heat of the dance floor.

After waiting almost an hour, we decided come back later.  We came back down around 1 to find that most of the line was gone.  After a short wait, we got in!  The club was stunning.  I believe there were three levels with the main DJ being on the first floor and hip hop being spun on the second floor.  The club is HUGE and it's connected to the outside pool area.

We went here on a Saturday night and got in gratis since we had a great hookup. You ride in an elevator up to the club. Inside the main room is amazing with cool elements that rise and fall from the ceiling, and a huge LED Screen behind the DJ. Being inside this club is confusing because there are hallways that lead to nowhere, stairs all over the place and dark corridors. For whatever reason the people dancing all faced DJ Lema instead of each other, we've never experienced that in any other club. 

We took a look outside and the poolside bartender didn't know how to make a Wet Panty and acted like I was the crazy one. What's with the attitude?  Dude, you're all of 22, get over yourself!

We love going to clubs wherever we travel and we've been to other LV clubs when they first opened up, like Pure and Tryst. We've also been to Pure's sister club, Aura.  in the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas and danced til 5am. Marquee just didn't do it for us. The main room was playing EDM which we love, but the music just wasn't inspiring. We checked out the library, which is pretty much the only place to sit down if you don't have a VIP table. The best room was the Hip Hop room, which was totally packed and the music was great. If we had started out in here we probably would have stayed and dropped some cash on drinks, but after the lackluster experience in the main room we were done.

To exit the club we had to walk down 4 flights of stairs. Good luck to the girls wearing high heels, thankfully I was wearing flats and made it downstairs without incident.",7,5,4

The only issue I had with Marquee was the bar tenders during ladies open bar, a few of them were rude! I was waiting to get a drink during open bar and a gentlemen approached the bar at the same time i did; when the bar tender finally approached us the gentleman said ""you go ahead and order"" and I said ""no you go ahead!"" finally the male bar tender interrupted us and said to the gentlemen ""you go ahead you're paying, she's not!"" RUDE! I totally get it, i am not paying but that does not mean to be rude during happy hour! It is a service MARQUEE provides, which is great but the bar tenders obviously don't understand that.

There are only two critiques I hope they change:

1) There was nowhere to sit down. Luckily, we swooped in on a big loungy couch outside but other than that, if your feet really hurt, you should just leave.

The main floor, from what I remember, plays electro, and there's another room that plays hip hop. Those were the most popular. 

It is so chaotic inside on a busy night. If you come with a group that's more than 4 people, expect to get broken up, because my group got broken up for the rest of the night practically the moment we stepped in. Someone got lost, someone fell, someone lost their cell phone, someone got kicked out, someone shoved someone, etc. The entrance and exits are really confusing too. I remember having to walk up and down like, 5 flights of stairs behind the club, just to get out. My main complaint though is that my friend got kicked out for no reason. I literally was walking next to him across the room and a bouncer picked him out and escorted him out the club.

Douchebags flailing their arms and fisting the air like no other. You may just end up with a concussion after a night out at Marquee. Ratchets are sloppy drunks, staggering around trying to look sexy and dance. LOL, they seriously just like a ragdoll. Hot.

If you go, make sure you have  one aim and one aim only- to have a darn good time because it is all everyone is there to do. The hype is well, real - You can tell when you're  in one. I can't stand hype, so I tend to analyze and reanalyze, but this was warranted. I have to say that the crowd was a good genteel set, no low brows ass grabbing spitting beings here. They were insane, but comfortable to be with. 

The lighting----is hard to be beat. Its like lighting on steroids. Amazing job with that. The DJ (I was in the EDM side) was not bad, worse thing you can do to me is get into electronic, and just leave the damn cuts running like even I can do it on any given afternoon (kidding, no I can't ;) but still) So, I can say that the DJ was good enough, not terribly exciting, but fine. 

Its classiness comes with a price. $50 for men. Unless of course, you have a room at the Cosmo, in which case its free. Thats enough a reason already. That, and no cabs after. 

This club is big in an odd way. Its stacked, with many sections, and the main room opens up to the pool area, which REALLY helps coz thats how many people are in there. The fresh air is a welcome breeze, and makes for a laid back vibe if you so choose it.

Their exit stairs, however, is just horrendous. They throw you out of the club like cattle, walking mercilessly down three floors on metal fire exit stairs. And with heels---this was just a torture.

Since we planned on spending the day there, we opted for 2 chairs. Most pitchers of mixed drinks were $75, (up to $150) steep but good. I have to say if you're going to do that, the Margarita is the most potent, choose wisely :)

The day we went was a Tuesday, so no cover, which was nice, but not many people were there. My top was the only one off all day, and I was only allowed to stay that way on my daybed. I had to put it back on to get in the pool or go to the bar...

Luckily, I was able to redeem myself when I went this past year with my girls. We were able to get in for FREE and keep in mind it was already 12am. We saw some girls that had to pay, but we were so thankful that we didn't have to. We immediately went to the main bar and went straight for the LC and Henessey shots (2 LC & 2 Henessey = $60). It wasn't bad compared to XS (5 shots of LC = $75). 

My girls and I had so much fun at Marquee because we were lucky enough to get snagged by whole bunch of Asian dudes and hung out at their table. We had bottle service right next to the DJ stage. For the most part after this was such a blurr.

We bought 2 bottles for $1400 at approx 1AM and each had about 1-2 drinks since we only had 2 bottles.  At approx 2:45AM some of us decided to go to the restroom.  One of my friends sat on the counter to rest and was rudely told by a security guard to get off the counter...she did but then she kinda leaned on it again and this time the guard yelled at her to get off and to show her ID.  We told her we left our belongings at the table and she was sorry so she said send another friend to go get the ID as I stood next to my friend waiting for it.  She then proceeded to call security to escort my friend out.  I was shocked since she had just sent my other friend to go get the ID.  Why didn't she just tell us to all leave or escort us all out instead of making us split and get lost from each other.  As they escorted my friend out they wouldn't let us go with her from the same exit they wanted us to leave her alone and go out from another exit.  If my friend was too intoxicated as the security claimed why would Marquee management not want their clients to leave their venue accompanied by friends instead of alone?  We spend $1400 to enjoy less than 2 hrs of fun and we all got lost from each other and our belongings.  Horrible night.

Getting to Marquee proved a little confusing because the club entrance isn't located on the first floor like most other clubs. However, on your way up to Marquee, you get to see all the pretty decorations the Cosmo has to offer. You can even stop to take a photo by the dangling crystal light fixtures. When we arrived to the club, we were directed to to the guestlist line. Another plus is how quickly the security guards let you into the club if you are on the guestlist, unlike Hakkasan, who made us wait an hour to get inside.

Once inside, you take an elevator up to the main floor where the headliner DJ begins to perform around 1:00 - 1:30 AM. From here you can either continue to the back of the club which leads to the outside rooftop area or down the stairs to the hip-hop floor. 

The hip-hop floor is small themed. It has a small bar and a good sound system, but a terribly small dance floor. There are also a few small tables surrounding the floor.

As for the outside pool area, it is pretty relaxed because it is not as packed and stuffy compared to being inside any club in general. The outside has pretty palm trees and a great rooftop view of the Vegas lights and buildings. This is also where their day club occurs. There is another DJ here so the cabanas and tables outside have music. 

The main dance floor is not terribly small, but it is not big either. When it gets packed (around 1 AM, sometimes maybe earlier) they do not allow you on the dance floor. I walked over to a side entrance and just made my way to the dance floor anyways.

Overall, Marquee is a great club with three musically different areas. They have great views and they offer areas to sit for anyone suffering from sore feet. And their security aren't pushy like those at Hakkasan. I love the light sticks they have and the DJs they have here as well! The only thing that this club could do differently is the location of their bathrooms, one is located outside near the pool area and the another is outside on the hip-hop floor. It is a journey to get to one of these bathrooms from the main dance floor.",2,1,1

Came here the Friday before NYE and lo-ooo-ved it. I don't know if it was because it was such a stark contrast from the other ones I went to the previous night buuut this place is bumpin'. Good people, good music + lots of space (inside + outside, whoop!) to move your pretty self around. Even though our party didn't have to pay the cover, I would definitely have forked over the $ to get all up in this lovin'.

A huge drawback is the insanity that is the stairs. I know everyone and their mothers (hey, why not) must have mentioned this but THOSE STAIRS. Wore a pair of 5 inch heels and Maqrquee's floor climbing experience has nearly made me swore off heels for life. 

Ladies, prepare to climb many flights of stairs. And if you're going through the promoters' side, many more flights of stairs. The upside is though, no matter which floor you're hiking your way up (or down), its worth it. I loved that the first two floors had good music & the third floor was more chill (complete with pool tables + all!) and relaxed.

We headed to the perimeter of the dance floor. Within 15 minutes of entering the club, my cell phone was stolen out of my clutch. All of our honeymoon pictures were on that phone. I was devastated. To make things worse, security gave us the run-around, and we didn't end up leaving the Cosmopolitan until about 3 hours later. There were 3 other people that were making similar complaints of stolen cells while we were.

My friend got us on the guest list, and I thought the line moved fairly quick. It took maybe like 10 minutes total. They gave us wristbands for the free open bar, which only allowed you to get beer or well drinks. Since the open bar is only until 11:30, the bar areas were pretty crowded. Can't really complain as it was free! The drinks are pretty strong, too.

As for the club itself, it is a pretty cool space, but very cramped! Granted, I know I went on a Saturday night, but I feel they could open up the dance floor more by moving some of the VIP tables further back. It feels less like you're dancing and more like you're being sandwiched between sweaty strangers who spill their drinks on you.

I was told there is usually an outdoor space, which alleviates some of the crowding, but unfortunately it was closed when we went. 

The music is pretty cool, though, as are the lighting shows. It gets pretty hot since it's so packed, so it's nice when they blast cool air down on the dance floor.",1,1,2

I'll start off with the pros: Marquee is able to lasso some renown DJ's (I came the night Redfoo of LMFAO fame was deejaying) and I liked the music in the main room and in the smaller hip hop area. There's a nice balcony\/pool area, that is all the more enjoyable if you go during a warm evening.

Everything else about this club is a nightmare.  If you are absolutely insistent on checking this place out, I have only one recommendation for you: GET A TABLE.  If you do not get one, you will have to deal with the following:

1) Rude ass bouncers both outside AND inside the club!  Yes, I understand you've been standing for hours herding and hustling people (most of whom are probably not fun to deal with, drunk or sober), but be professional.  You chose this job.  Or maybe you didn't.  In which case, it might be time to get that GED.  

2) Crowds and crowds of people.  Maybe you're into that sort of thing, but I like to go to the club to dance, not have to deal with drunk white girls pushing me and screaming at me when I literally did not touch them and getting elbowed in the face and kneed in the back of my legs.  If you do not have a table, you will constantly be herded by the bouncers to places with no space.  You are NOT allowed to stand in walkways or enter dance areas that are already at full capacity.  If you stop to rest, a bouncer will yell at you.  If you stop to take off your heels to rest your feet (due to climbing an endless flight of stairs, see point #4), a bouncer will yell at you.  

3) Nuclear levels of douchebaggery.  Some guy named Cash who is an employee of this fine establishment helped our entire party get in without a cover.  Honestly, I was thankful to him and wanted to just tip him for his generosity.  But we didn't, and he ended up spouting some nonsense to us about how he'll get us a table and free drinks.  Well, these ""free drinks"" ended up being $20 a pop and consisted of an 8 oz cup of club soda.  No alcohol.  My guess is Cash pocketed most of the cash and lived up to his name.  Uncool, dude.  No need for that type of play.  I would have rather he be upfront about things.  But that is exactly the type of BS that you'll have to deal with coming into a place like this. Naturally, Cash left to do his thang and the promise of free drinks and a table left with him.

4) The stairs: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/WUq8HJHIZU4uteB154XN7w?select=JvT5VYkd_3HHLnrljGKv7w.  Absolutely unacceptable.  Whoever designed this club needs to be fired.

The venue itself is beautiful. 3 different levels, 3 different themes. The main floor is where most people are at. The night we were there, they had a special performer so it was WAAAAY too crowded. I didn't even feel like it was a dance floor. More like people just watching the DJ while shoving everyone around. The outside area of the main floor is very spacey, its a good place to chill to take a breather or talk to people. The upstairs library area that isn't really anything unless you want to get lost with someone there ;). The downstairs has a hiphop room which actually had people dancing. I was there most of the time, because we actually had space to move around.

The staircases here were also terribly designed. They should've took inspiration from Palms and used escalators instead to get from floor to floor.

I was expecting to be amazed and go WOW, but sadly, it only crossed my mind once.  Could've been that I pictured it differently or that my expectations were too high.  

Since two of us didn't get to Vegas until 1030PM, we missed the chance to get our stamps.  However, after meandering through the crowd, we were lucky enough to find a nice bouncer that let us in without having to wait in the super long line.  Outside it looked like it was another Asian Invasion, but once inside, the crowd was pretty diverse.  Maybe they have an Asian quota?? =P

Once you pay\/get through, you use an elevator to go down to the actual club.  The first thing you see is a bar in an underwhelming room.  Drinks are the usual Vegas price, $15\/shot.  To get to the different rooms, you have to go up and down stairs, which are killer when you're wearing heels.  It's also a buzzkill.  The Boombox Room was pretty standard in terms of layout and design.  This was the only room that played hip-hop though and it was crazy packed!  The Library Room is more lounge-y since it's small and designed for a more cozy feel.  There's no room for dancing, but there is a pool table and chairs to sit if you're tired.  It does have a small balcony, apparently the place to makeout and hookup, that overlooks the Main\/Performance Room, which was Marquee's only wow factor for me.  The EC Twins were spinning that night and it's definitely got a rave\/house feel to it.  I really liked this room, however I didn't get to spend much time in it.  The main dance floor is in the middle of everything, but due to the fact that it was sooooooo packed, they weren't letting anymore people in.  Too bad.

It might have been the mix of lots of shots and super nice people who gave us free alcohol at their tables, but overall I had fun.  It won't be my first choice for a club when I go to Vegas, but it's definitely not my last.",0,1,1

I had a body suit and shorts on. How the hell was I not allowed in to a pool party where eventually I was going to remove my shorts. There was nothing wrong with my body suit it looked like a damn top. I was so livid because my husband and I specifically left to Vegas that morning on June 19 2017 checked in to Tahiti, got ready had breakfast and headed to Marquee to see dj Carnage play. Due to traffic and uber we arrived there around 2-3pm. Then they directed me to the store next door ""so convenient"" to purchase a cover up that ranged from $115-215. Why or who in would ever pay that. By the time we go back to our room grab a top and go back probably would of been between 4-6pm. This ruined our day, and we ended up going to Vegas to just walk the strip that night and go home the next day. I was very upset and I will not be coming back here again. I work in marketing and social media and you better bet the word will be spread. I payed $ for tickets and that went down the drain. I would at least think they would have some common sense to mention dress code enforced even though it's a pool party you are going too. I am highly disappointed still.

The boombox room gets way too crowded to even move and on the main floor, once Nadia Ali came on, there were no ins or outs on the dance floor since security stopped the crowd.  It was ridiculous - packed like sardines.  I would never want to be put in that predicament again especially after someone stole my bff's iphone from her purse that night.

The last two times my friends and I got a bed floating in the water next to the DJ outside, and its always been amazing.

This review is for the last time I went.  This particular group had people fly in from all over for a friends birthday, and the birthday girl got a table that turned out to be inside the club.  This was fine, except for when we tried to go to the pool.  No one was let outside.  Apparently, its acceptable for them to sell tables for a ""day club"" and not let the customers set foot in the day light.  I'm talking about not even one foot.  I was appalled, and I'm pretty sure everyone else inside was too.  If you looked around everyone was in shorts and bikinis, and I'm pretty sure they didn't get dressed up that way to be inside all day.

Tickets to get in are pretty expensive: $50 for men and $20 for women. Keep in mind that these ticket prices are pre-sale so I'm guessing they get even more expensive as the night moves along. The advantage of getting the tickets pre-sale was that we didnt have to wait in line (and it was a really really long line). Drinks are also pretty price (average of $14 per cocktail and $9 per beer). 

The venue itself is awesome. There are three levels in the club; each with a different atmosphere. The main dance floor is very crowded. It also has a gigantic outdoor pool side. There are also multiple bars so the wait time for a drink isn't too long. This is the largest level. The other two levels are a bit smaller. One is a room primarily for hip-hop, while the other is more chill with pool tables and other games

In summary, I would definitely recommend this club to anyone visiting Vegas. The only reason it got 4 stars was because it's a bit pricey.",0,0,0

All I know is we entered from the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan & were let into some dark hallway to wait for an elevator that made me feel like I was waiting for the Hollywood Tower of Terror ride at Disneyland. I have no idea where the elevator took us, but we walked out and wandered around looking for the bathroom & were told to go upstairs. OMG IT'S THE HORRIBLE STAIRS THAT EVERYONE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT! It's like a regular stairway that you'd find in a hotel except it's dark & I wouldn't be surprised if someone fell and got injured. It's like a lawsuit waiting to happen... or maybe has happened?

Anyway, I felt like this place was too scattered. There was an extremely crowded hip hop room where the DJ played music that made me want to spend most of the time sitting on a box instead of dance, which is exactly what I did. It felt like he kept playing Black Eyed Peas or other music from 2009. The room was seriously over max capacity... there wasn't even space to move\/dance at all. I thought I was going to die right there trapped in the middle of the dance floor.

The main dance floor on the 2nd floor was a lot better than the hip hop room and played better music. It also led to the large patio area outside, which was pretty nice. I would recommend wearing comfortable shoes here since there are lots of stairs.",1,1,1

So it was pretty crowded and crazy over the weekend. My cousins and I had plan this trip for months and made sure we had to be in the guest list otherwise we would be screwed and had to wait in line for about 2 hours or more. We had about 25+ people in our party and none of us had to pay and we probably waited in line for 20 minutes. Luckily, my cousin Jay got us a good hook up. 

As for the ratio goes, we had to have an equal number of girls and guys to get into the VIP guest list and we all had to be there at 930 in line otherwise if we were missing some people we had to walk back to to the very end  of the line and start all over!. Since we had a pretty big group we decided not to get tables because they we're offering to give us a table and bottles but every person has to pay at least $130...ummmm how about no?! I don't think paying $130 is worth going to ANY club...for what, just to dance for a few hours ? haha  i mean, personally i don't think spending that much money is worth getting in. If you want to drink and get chocolate wasted just pregame it before headed out to the clubs otherwise drinks at this place is $14! 

What is pretty cool about this place, there are 3 floors..The main room is humongous which has an outside patio. Very big, there is a pool and gambling tables on the sides. The only downfall about this floor is they play techno music all night long!! So if you like that kind of music and know how to fist pump then this is where you want to be at! Otherwise, you can check out the second floor where they play hip hop music. (which sort of sounds like techno too...but a remix version?) Now this floor is a lot smaller than the first one. The dance floor was a big disappointment. There was no way you can shake your ass or at least do the two step. It was too crowded, i had to shove some people to get out of my way, but hey! you got to do what you got to do! haha We didn't get the chance to get out the 3rd floor, but one of the security guys told me it was just a lounge, a place to just chill and relax nothing too fancy.

Overall, it was pretty cool, just wish they play better music. So, plan ahead. Get on a guest-list asap and drink before going there...UNLESS you go to the tables and gamble. Order your drinks from waitresses and all you got to do is tip them.. WORTH IT then paying $14.. That's how i got mess up and didn't spend too much.. oooh yeah!",3,4,3

We put ourselves on the guestlist for Marquee on Christmas Eve and it was free for even ratio until midnight. We didn't end up leaving Encore until 11:25pm and arrived at the Cosmopolitan valet at 11:41pm. I was starting to worry that I had napped too long and wouldn't make it before midnight. When we got into the guestlist line, it was already 11:47pm. I was mentally prepared to make alternative plans.

To my surprise, the bouncers were extremely nice and expedited the guestlist line even though the presale and general admission lines were long. The guy checking ID (11:58pm at this point) had a big smile on his face and greeted each customer happily and wished me a happy birthday. We were off to a great start!

I'm not a party animal and I'm also old now. I just wanted to go out for a little bit that night. We went up the elevator and got ourselves each a drink and headed to the incredibly crowded dance floor. It was clear that once we got onto the dance floor, it was going to be impossible to leave and come back. We found a tiny bit of space toward the DJ booth at the front. Andrew Rayel was the headliner and his set was just ok. Where we stood was too close and it would've been better had we had a broader view of the club, lights, and dancers. But we were stuck and the floor was extremely sticky. I planted my feet down and stuck my elbows out to protect my personal space.

It was alright but after an hour or so, I had about enough. We fought our way off the dance floor and headed outside for a few minutes. Even the covered pool area was very crowded. My feet were killing me at this point and I had already proven to my 31 year old self that I could stay up past midnight and party with the kids. It was time to head back to my comfortable bed, but not before going through Marquee's signature torture of many flights of stairs for intoxicated girls in heels.",7,7,5

This is definitely your typical Vegas scene with the loud music, the 2 foot tall margaritas, and everyone looking like they're in a sorority\/frat. 

For the pool parties, make sure to get there on the early side so you can get in for free (ladies). They tend to start charging after 4pm. For the nightclub, I'd get there by 11pm unless the promoter says otherwise. Look up the promoters on Instagram for free entry! The bigger nights will charge but they will still get you in and can drink at their table. Hit them up a few days before if top DJ's like Calvin Harris are coming through.

Yes, it's not cheap, especially if you're a guy - I spent 45 bucks to get in and that was already with a slight discount - still, I thought the experience was worth it.   

Everyone here is pretty well dressed and there's definitely a lot of room to move around without feeling too squished, unless of course, you're near the dance floor. You'll probably find hip hop on the bottom floor, house music on the larger middle floor (huge awesome screen btw), more alternative sounds on the smaller and library-themed upper floor and more popular music outside the middle floor - as I said, all the floors are really well designed. Drinks, not surprisingly, are priced like any other club\/bar. 

I do have to admit, I probably would've given this place a better rating if it wasn't for the exit - you have to go down a good three or more four of stairs to the first floor - I think this is pretty much a safety hazard if you factor in people who have had a bit too much of drink or girls who are wearing heels (take them off ladies).

I was trying to get past one to join my group's table but evidently took the wrong route. Instead of saying ""Sorry, you can't get thru that way, please go around that way."" I was blocked, stared down and simply told ""No, you need to leave"" and was then promptly knocked in the gut as he turned his tank of a body around, spilling my drink all over me. I was simply shocked!! I tried to ask him how to get where I needed to be, but this *horrible* human being actually turned his entire body away from me as I tried to get his attention. 

Fine. Forget you. 

So I got around the long way and get to where I needed to be. The girl that was taking care of our table was fantastically sweet and attentive, no problems there. After splitting away from the team to bounce on the dance floor, I come back to find our table over-crowded with invaders. Before I can even squeak, there's another ox grabbing me by the arm telling me I couldn't be there and some jerk who I had never seen before sitting at *our* table encouraging the bouncer to remove me!! 

I asked for a manager and was simply told NO. I asked if this is how they typically treat their guests, he just stares. I fibbed and said I was staying at the hotel rather than my friends, ""Is this how you treat your hotel guests?"" he answers ""I'm affiliated with the Bar, not the Hotel, so yeah. Don't like it? Leave.""

Shocked, appalled, disgusted.

We were excited to check this place out because we heard it was the spot where everyone goes.  In that respect, it didn't disappoint.  The place was packed and fun as hell.  The beach balls flying around was awesome and made for a good time.  The pool was a little shallow, but not the end of the world.  I thought the clear tables for girls to dance on was a nice touch.

What I didn't like was all of the rules.  When we got there, we were told that our friend couldn't go in because he was wearing a wife beater\/tank top.  It's not like he wasn't going to just immediately take it off, so I'm not sure what the issue was.  Instead, he had to go and buy a crappy $30 shirt from the hotel just to be allowed in.  I was wearing a sleeveless shirt, but somehow that was okay.  Next, we were told that there are no bags allowed into the pool area.  We had to fork out another $20 for a locker to store our bags.  Again, that seemed kinda inconvenient.  The next thing was the ""Pool Nazi"" who walked around the pool telling you that you could only have your drinks outside of the pool.  Do they not realize how much piss and other bodily fluids are already in this pool?!?!?!  Is there a difference between somebody spilling some of their $10 Miller Lite and somebody pissing in the pool?  I really don't think so!  Lastly, there was a European guy there wearing a speedo.  They came up to him and made him leave the pool and buy some shorts because his swimsuit was too short.  I felt bad for the dude.  The suit wasn't that uncommon for a European guy, but I guess these folks just couldn't stand for that.

All in all, I had a great time though.  I would've given this place 5 stars, but I felt that they take themselves way too seriously in respect to all of their rules\/regulations.  If I could've combined Ditch Fridays @ the Palms rules with this location\/atmosphere it would've been the absolute perfect time.",2,0,1

There's a total of three floors to the Marquee night club: top floor - private tables and lounge area (looks like a library), middle floor - main floor that plays mostly house and EDM music, and the bottom floor - hip hop music. 

If you're on the main dance floor, there are three bars located on the inside and a stage set up with LED lights. Though I do like the DJ's that they host here, the layout of the dance floor is just not people friendly. The dance floor is very small and is surrounded by booths and tables which makes getting in and out a pain. The bouncers also close out the dance floor when it gets too crowded which leaves you to herd like cows to either the bar area or outside. 

Outside has two-three bars and has card tables for gambling if you want to sit around and chill. However, the minimum bet is usually ~$50 which is a little too steep for my blood. 

As a dayclub, I feel like Marquee is very small. There are two small rectangular pools, one that is only about 5-12"" deep in which you can reserve cabana style seating and sit right in the center of the pool. Cute waterfall decor on that pool. The main pool goes up to about 3.5-4 feet deep, which is fine for a Day Club but beware of getting into Vegas Day club pools. o.O 

FRIENDLY TIP: 
This place has suddenly had an surge of theft activity, a group of my friends went to Marquee and had all their ID's stolen (not sure why ID's but ALL of them) and on a separate occasion, I recently went and my friend and I had our iPhones stolen right out of our purses. One of my friends found her purse unzipped and she was certain she zipped it 30 minutes before. If you decide to go here, please leave your valuables at the hotel - all you need is ID and cash (steer away from bringing phones and credit cards if you can).  Just makes me sad thinking there are people out there doing that regularly. :[",4,0,0

First, if you do not like EDM\/Techno music...stop reading... do not go here, you will not like it. Other then the very crowded Boom Room at night, it's All EDM, all the time.
Next a big Thanks to Amber Anderson, one of the hosts at Marquee who did a fantastic job at setting us up with a table on Saturday night to see Kaskade. And a note to all of those going . The line into this place is crazy, so when your host or promoter says get there at 10 pm... Don't be late, after that they will be impossible to reach or your table will be gone. We talked to a group earlier in the day who said they had a table reserved for Friday night but got there around midnight rather than 10 pm  too late, it was gone. 
Our waitress was great and the best part was our security guy. He kept our area clear of random guys and watched over our Bachelorette group like we were his sisters.
Great music, packed dance floor with some cool relief outdoors around the pool.
Two complaints..... 
First...The much talked about stairs....yes there are lots of them, we did not go upstairs or downstairs very much and thanks to yelp, we brought some flats. A full evening in 5 inch heels is tough on a girl.
Second.... bathrooms... not enough and they are in remote areas...
Still a great time was had 

Day Club....
As a Cosmopolitan guest we got free entry.. as a group of 4 to 7 women staying at the Cosmo we got quick free entry.
The day club is a combination music club, frat party, drinking contest and tiny tiny bikini contest... ( I tied for second place the last day there :)
We had great time. Never went into the main pool....not sure what color the water was... but it was not clear... But we were invited to a few of the cabana's that had their own private hot tubs in front... very cool set up. 
Not sure what some of the other Vegas pool parties are like... but it will be hard to top the fun we had here !",2,0,3

I've never has a bad experience because most of the time I have a great promoter that usually hooks up with a efficient experience. Marquee is located in the beautiful Cosmo hotel. That hotel is one of the prettiest hotel I've ever visited. From the lobby to the entrance, the chandeliers and the shimmering tiles make the hotel so elegant. The rooms are pretty awesome as well. Super clean, and you don't smell the cigarettes. 

On to da club. I enjoy this club is because it is big. There are three different floors. 1. The EDM floor where there is a big DJ that spins. This is the largest floor with tables and bars that extends. There is also a big patio area that leads outside where there are other tables (I am guess this is where more affordable tables are.) The decorations outside are pretty fancy as well. There is also a hiophop floor. We all have that friend that doesn't dig the whole house music. You guys don't have to split the clubs up! Just split floors. The other floor is the mini bar floor where the bougie folks who enjoy chatting it up without the grinding or the unce unce. 

Girls usually never have to worry about drinks because it's Vegas. They are practically treated like princesses. But guys, I am sorry. Vegas is where you have to roll deep with the bands. I am assuming that guys usually have to pay about 15+ per drink or shot. Bottles can range from 4K-10K (?) 

Entrance and Guestlist fee. I highly recommend getting in contact with a host a promoter so you he\/she can cut you a sweet deal. Party Safe!",0,0,0

Little tip... if you are looking for a place to sit down- there are swings outside and upstairs on the level of the library room there is a couch and chairs in a halfway.. it's rather strange and in a secluded area, but if your feet hurt bad enough it's at least a place to sit and chill for a minute that doesn't cost $2000!",1,0,0

I was out with two friends, looking for something to do and randomly ended up here this past Friday.  It was after midnight and we were on our way to the Chandelier Bar for a cocktail and saw the HUGE line out in front of Marquee and figured it might be something good.  I talked to the door guy for a second and he escorted us past the line and the cashier to the elevator.  Score!!

Being newbies, we explored a bit before picking our spot.  The outside area was gorgeous... swimming pools, palm trees, music, and an incredible view.  We found our way to the bar and ordered up some drinks.  The bartender came to us right away and was super friendly.  There was a bit of sticker shock on the prices, but she hooked it up strong.

We enjoyed our drinks outside before heading in for the real show...

Audien was playing.  Holy smokes it was good.  The sound system was incredible.  The light show was spectacular.  Beautiful go-go dancers.  And the music.... wow.  We danced our feet off until after 4:00am and the party was still going strong.  I was wishing for more comfortable shoes so I could keep dancing.

I've seen some complaints on here about rude staff, but that couldn't be further from the truth for us.  We actually commented to each other about how polite and friendly everybody was.  Which is weird for a nightclub.  Guess we have lowered expectations coming from Atlanta.  lol.  But seriously, every staff member we encountered was very welcoming.

And the crowd was amazing.  Very few amateurs.  They do a great job at filtering out the obvious d-bags at the door.

First of all, the club is really cool. We bought a table and we were next to the pool and had plenty of room to chill in the cabanas. However, inside the club is small and there is no where to dance. In addition, our waitress was unattentive even though we had 2 bottles and dropped about $2K. Lastly, some cheap a$$es sat a our cabana and I had to continually chase them out vs security doing their job. $hit, I already have a job.

Outside of the club's controls was a couple of guys who split the table w\/ us. The first guy I will call ""Ron"". He gets too $hitfaced and is bending at the waist like the matrix. He ultimately falls down and gets kicked out of the club. It was pretty late any way, but on the way out if the hotel, we lose him. He tells us the next day he doesn't remember what happened, but he had over $2,000 more in his pocket than he remembered. I asked him if his a$$ hurt - LOL. Then he said he remembered going to a table. Honestly, I think he sold himself to a shemale - lmfao. My friends and I now say when one of gets too drunk, ""Don't be a Ron"".

The second guy who I will call Von said initially he wanted to share the table. However, later he said he only wanted to pay for what he drank. I have known him a long time so I told him to pay what he thought he owed when we returned to OC. He ended up giving me $250 after sharing a table and sarging on our action at Bare the next day. What a cheapa$$! His middle name is Von so now when we refer to a pake (Hawaiian for cheapa$$), my friends and I say, ""Don't be a Von"".

The moral to the story is when you go to Vegas don't be a Ron or a Von - lmfao",3,15,2

Nightclub:
OMASL;KFJL;ZJXCVLKJ THE NIGHT CLUB IS THE WORST THING EVER.

Dear architect of Marquee, building a club that's 3 levels = worst idea ever. Oh, you think you're so clever & unique for coming up with such a fresh design, huh? This is completely absurd. What they should've done was either make these 3 levels 3 completely separate clubs, or just had one club on one floor completely.

Marquee is a very ""trendy"" club these days so everyone crowds to get in. Even if the DJ that's spinning is a nobody, it's still crowded, which means the elevators are blocked off (WTF MARQUEE, SERIOUSLY.) & you're all forced to use the stairs.

These stairs are not nice carpeted stairs, no, these are straight-up, ""in-case of fire emergency, use the stairs"" stairs. Industrial metal stairs. How tacky is it to force your club-goers to walk up 5+ flights of stairs to their destination while most of them are intoxicated & in heels? Yeahhhh brilliant. Up & down the stairs, no access to the elevators.

The main floor isn't that big. The dance floor isn't that big, it's kind of awkwardly situated, the hip-hop room blows (hello high school prom music!!), & that other floor is unremarkable. 

Their drinks suck. Had the worst tasting AMF here ever. Come on, night shift, let's go.

Highlight of Marquee happens to be the mermaids that swim in the pool. I only feel sorry for them because they're stuck swimming in that nasty thing.

Who says that you need to be filthy rich, a celebrity VIP, or attached to a group of skankily-dressed girls in order to waltz into what is (supposedly) the hottest nightclub in the USA right now?  I'm a nobody, but they let me into Marquee -- and I had a blast!  Here are my tips:

1.  BE A HOTEL GUEST.  Assuming there isn't some special event going on, Cosmopolitan hotel guests don't pay cover (which, in the case of guys, is upwards of $50).  Hotel guests even have their own line, which means only 5 minutes of waiting instead of the usual 2+ hours.  That's all it took for me to move past the velvet rope.  (It also helps to be super polite to the bouncers and door staff.  They're used to self-entitled douchebags throwing money around, so a simple ""please"" and ""thank you"" will go a long way.)

2.  PREPARTY APPROPRIATELY.  In my case, it was a Yelp event down the street.  In your case, it may be vodka in your room or a cocktail in the Chandelier bar (conveniently located across from the Marquee entrance).  Anything to avoid paying for $20 well drinks inside the nightclub.

3.  FIND A LIQUOR REP.  Speaking of avoiding overpriced drinks -- it turns out that many Vegas nightclubs have reps from beverage companies giving out freebies of new booze that they're trying to market.  Look for these people, be friendly to them, and tip them a lot!  The night I was there, Asahi beer reps were giving out free bottles, and girls in short skirts were carrying trays of free vodka cocktails.  Good times!

4.  WEAR COMFORTABLE SHOES.  Marquee is a gorgeous venue, but it's enormous and spread out over several levels.  I was lucky enough to be whisked up to the club via elevator, but latecomers have to walk up some 4-5 flights of stairs.  On the main level, there is the main room with a dancefloor, the pool\/dayclub\/cabana area, as well as the smaller Boombox room.  Up even higher is the Library (my personal favorite), with a more eclectic music selection and stylish decor.

5.  MEET OODLES OF CRAZY BRAZILIANS AND AUSTRALIANS.  Vegas nightclubs are especially popular with international tourists -- and Marquee is no exception.  Foreigners are especially keen on meeting Americans, drinking with Americans, dancing with Americans, and then proceeding to make out with Americans.  Take advantage of this... if you dare.

6.  DANCE SO MUCH THAT YOU FORGET HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO SIT.  It's true that there's nowhere to sit in Marquee unless you're dropping thousands of dollars on table service.  Screw sitting down -- that's for wimps anyway.  I recommend that you stay standing -- and dance the night away instead.  :-)",20,22,9

Well, mostly because we were staying at Planet Hollywood & Cosmo was right across the street from us. Didn't feel like cabbing to XS (slightly regretting it...), plus promoter hookups for both nights = free (for the ladies obviously...the lone guy in our party had to pay $25) & speedy entrance. 

Marquee is gorgeous, I would say a larger version of TAO (from the same creators). Different levels, music & decor and very maze-like. Indoor & outdoor. Luckily, we went with someone who has been there before, so she showed us all the different rooms without us mindlessly wandering around. 

""Boombox"" area (I think the 5th floor?) = the best music (mostly hip\/hop) if you like the top 40's. The main dance floor (6th floor?) is mostly house. Good variety for those with groups who like both types of music. 

Guy to girl ratio was pretty ridiculous for both nights. Lots of girls! I have to say, crowd is (from what I remember) waaaaaaay better looking at XS...or maybe because I spent all my time at the hiphop floor.

However, as many female Yelpers mentioned...this place was definitely designed by a MAN. I loved each floor and the mix of music, but the stairs got super excessive even though I had pretty comfortable shoes on!

The club was POPPIN' off the HOOK on Party Rock Monday! Got hooked up through my friend who knew a promoter and got in pretty fast upstairs. The line downstairs was crazy - but we got in in like 10 mins as opposed to 30 minutes. And...it only took 10 minutes because it was some crazy back alley way to the club from the pool entrance. I thought they were gonna murder us for a while there, but luckily we turned out okay! 

The drinks were standard pricing but pretty hopped up. If you give a hefty tip, expect a hefty drink - that's just how it works in Vegas. The water was ridiculous at $8 a bottle but I guess it was Voss...so...that makes it ok? Meh whatever! 

I really liked the outdoor patio because it had a decent view and the system was BOOMIN'! However, the view from Caesar's Pure is MUCH better...too bad Pure hires douchebags (see Pure review). 

The bouncers were okay - not overly friendly but not super douchey either. It was pretty much, don't act a fool and they won't kick you out so that was cool.

No....SERIOUSLY...packed to the gills with gorgeous females as far as the eye can see!!! And a tip of the hat to the bar staff - they make some obscenely strong drinks. Sure, they're expensive, but you're getting your $$'s worth. My tip tho - find a local with pull for the guestlist, otherwise you'll be in line for friggin' ever.

They HOOK you up with everything, FREE GUEST-LIST for GUYS & GIRLS on a Saturday night on 9\/6\/14 to see KEVIN HART? Don't mind if we DO! 3 girls & 3 guys come before 12AM and there will be a short line and easy access to the club. Come after that and except a LONG LONG wait to get in the club. 

The club was pretty big compare to other clubs in vegas. The floor was jam packed, the DJ that night was Eric Dlux and hosted by Kevin Hart. There was an outside area too! Good if you wanted some fresh air! Though I suggest staying inside because that were the good DJs at! Plus they blast you with this air thingy you might not be able to see things for a couple a second and they're not cheap with those damn confetti! They hit you with that shit a couple of time LOL. Security was okay, they weren't so tight on it like checking your purse or patting you down, which is good. AMAZING view outside, great pools! 

Cons: FUHHHing took forever to get on those damn elevator, you have to wait in line to get in the line to get in the elevator to get up to the club. GROSS.... they try to fit so many people inside one elevator LOL & the worse part is everyone has to go down using stairs! Guys are whatever about it but GIRLS we wear friggin HIGH HEELS, trying to hurt our feet even more ahahahaha and while buzzed? No-No-No. I suggest you take off your heels or bring flats.",8,2,2

I wore leather-outsoled shoes and tested the surfaces all by myself. The eight-year-old geek in me is really proud of this. 

Main dance floor and area stretching out behind it: Can't figure out the material, but it's good for dancing, at least, until the spilled drinks ruin it. It's always fun being part of a huge crowd of people dancing, but it can get old because, well, you're stuck in a huge crowd of people dancing (spilling drinks and being drunk). Obviously, I recommend dropping by on the early side to enjoy this part.

Table service areas: Too slippery to dance safely, but cleaner, at least. There are these areas to dance on top of the couches, and lots of people do, but it's a narrow piece of furniture on which to try to express yourself, and dangerous, after several drinks. Basically, it's good just for the YOLO moment of dancing (rather, more like wiggling on a narrow ledge) up high, in full view of everyone, acting like you're having a wild night in Vegas. (I don't believe I actually used the term ""YOLO"" in a review, especially at my age. I'm both proud and awkwardly ashamed.)

From a pure flooring perspective, the rectangular tiles in the walkways between the concentric circles of the VIP tables are the best, OMG--the perfect amount of friction, but there's a lot of passing traffic. Later at night, it gets clogged with the traffic, though the amount of spilled drinks tends to be less than the main floor, but still a bit hard. 

Out back, there's an outdoor roof terrace with multiple pools. You can't go into the pools at night. Unsurprisingly, the concrete at the center of the area is only semi-okay. However, the concrete flooring at the edge of the pool area is surprisingly decent for dancing. It's likely to be less crowded and you can dance without sweating as much on a cool night. 

THE BEST PART FOR DANCING: In the back, where the entrance\/exit elevators are, is the bestest dance area if you really want to express yourself to the music. If you have good dancing shoes on, the flooring is PERFECT--such good swishy-ness! There's even a not-crowded bar back there, and Sarah the bartender is a lovely ray of sunshine! You can still hear the music but you're secluded from the deafening speakers. Very few spilled drinks. Aside from random foot traffic entering\/leaving the club, there's almost no one there, except in passing, so there's room to spread out and DANCE.

Bathrooms: Unfortunately, I forgot to test the floors here. Probably not advisable, anyway. They're quite lovely, though.",0,1,0

It took me the better part of a year and some change to finally get in here, and since then I've made it here a total of 5 times (4 times nightclub, 1 time dayclub).

After rediscovering my love for XS, witnessing the magic of Omnia, experiencing the extreme comfort of Drai's, and being done with Hakkasan, I've been around the block more than I ever anticipated I would when I couldn't even get into any Vegas club. I still love Marquee, but it's not my favorite anymore.

I still love the visuals setup (great LED wall, lasers to kill you) because it pretty much is a mini-rave. I love the expansive outside area (...even though they closed it last time I was there). And last I checked, this is the only club in Vegas that has a pool table in it (and also, the only club in Vegas in which a pool cue was cracked over my friend's head...but that's a story for another time).

But I worry for Marquee now though. They lost most of their DJs to Omnia and Life, Kaskade's gone to XS, and the place could definitely use a remodel (that dance floor and the hallways are just beyond sardine-cramping level).

My love for this place will keep me coming back because I always have a good time here. But yeah, DJs do matter to me. At least you guys still have Dash Berlin, Porter Robinson, Tritonal, and Andrew Rayel...and Alesso on some non-exclusive rights!

I'll find a reason to come back though. Nothing beats walking from my Cosmo room to Marquee, raging hard, getting Secret Pizza, and walking back to my room to eat my pizza!

P.S. Yeah I know I keep pimping his name out, but I wouldn't do it if he wasn't that good. I lost my Marquee contact, and my man Chris made sure I was squared away with zero drama or BS. Hit him up at (702) 722-8585, you won't find a better person to take care of all your Vegas needs.",7,2,2

I went there both Friday and Saturday night this past weekend and I have been twice before. Bottle service is the best way to go if you can afford it because the club and especially the dance floor get PACKED quickly. This is the reason that Marquee lost a star from me. It is almost unbearable to stay and dance when they let too many people in. I go for the dj and the music and my experience is ruined when I am being shoved and bumped into. I wish they would control that better. 

On the plus side the decor is great and it is clean. They set off a lot of confetti which is always fun and the go-go dancers are great. Girls should definitely get on a guest list to get in free, and it can cost a lot for guys depending on who is DJing. But then again, everything in Vegas costs a lot for guys. If you stay at the Cosmo and arrive at the club early you can get 2 people in free with your room ticket. Something I discovered this weekend is that you can enter from both the second and third floors but if you enter from the third floor there is no elevator so be prepared to walk up a lot of stairs. 

The vibe is very energetic and everyone seems like they are there to have a good time and not cause any problems. There are plenty of bars so it usually doesn't take long for drinks. There was an open bar for girls from 10-11 on Saturday so that was a definite plus and there still was not a wait to order a drink. This is currently one of the best spots in Vegas and despite the fact that it gets over-crowded you definitely need to check this spot out if you love EDM.",5,1,1

I personally prefer XS over Marquee by a long shot because of the strictness at Marquee and the chillness at XS.  At XS I can sit in the lounge areas and enjoy myself but at Marquee, there's only a couple spots that you're allowed to sit at and they are individual swinging chairs that are seldom free to sit in.  My friends' needed to sit down because they were exhausted but we were kicked off immediately.  I can understand not being allowed to sit down in an area that is reserved for people who pay for bottle service but I think they should at least have a bench somewhere for people to sit down and rest every now and then.  They also have a lot of rules about what pathways to walk on to enter the dance floor.  I understand it's to direct traffic but that just points out that the layout of the dance floor and the club isn't very good.  

Also, I don't like the partitioning in Marquee.  It's easy to lose your friends because there are so many different floors and separate rooms.  It's not as united as XS is.  I also don't like the huge flights of stairs you have to climb before arriving at the actual club.  

XS on the other hand is a lot more level.  Marquee however does have cool views of the city since it is located higher up. 

Plus if you're a boy, it's going to cost you a around $100 to get in. =T",2,0,1

I've had nothing but pleasant experiences so we'll start them off at 5 stars.

Our female friends were in their room getting ready, you know how females are? We were downstairs gambling, eating, pregaming, and getting ready to go in of course... We approach the line and the bouncer says he is unable to accommodate our party due to the ratio. We had explained that the girls were getting ready and this was our last night so we wanted to drink our faces and race to see who would get alcohol poisoning first.. He didn't care. Understandable, still at 5 stars to be GENEROUS.

You know the drill.. a hip hop room which was especially ratchet this night and MEGA crowded.. So crowded my shoes were trampled, girls hair was all up in my face, people grabbing so many asses including mine. PAUSE..... -1 We're at 4.

The insides are the same, beautiful as ever. HIP HOP floor, MAIN room which the usually HOUSE\/EDM DJ will spin and melt your faces, and the top THIRD floor aka the library is complete with bathroom and billards table for your lounging pleasure. 

The ratio was terrible that night. There were so many dudes there I felt like I was partying at an all-boys high school. It was awkward, weird, and lame all at the same time. Never experienced a ratio like that, guess I know why the bouncer was trying so hard to enforce at the door! -1 We're at 3.

The drinks were obviously overpriced, its Vegas don't lose your titties... BUT I was super duper mega ultra faded and ended up losing my CREDIT CARD! AH! The last charge was made at Marquee so I assume I bought some rounds and left it there? Regardless, there were no other charges. I'll give Marquee staff the benefit of the doubt and say they held it and tore it up until I could realize and call my bank 2 days later lololol!! +1 star. We're back at 4!

One for the best parts about this space is that they open up the outside area where the dayclub is. So you can meander around out there is you need some fresh air. 

But my favorite part is 'the library', a secret room upstairs with a private bar, seating, and a pool table! That is our designated spot every time we go to Marquee. And this year they had large screens so we could watch Kascade spin, the perfect setup! 

They also have gambling tables outside so there is a little bit of everything going on. But don't forget to hit up Secret Pizza when you leave! (located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo... just follow your nose).",3,0,2

The main dance floor reaches capacity so there is crowd control by security.  I received free drinks comp`d for ladies, free from glist. This is nice!! Free certain drinks until 11pm. I pounded it for 30 mins off redbull & kettel. That lasted me the entire night\/morning 5am =)

The only odd layout of this club is the entrance.  There are several entrances.  The back entrance is VIP\/GL? and leads to staircases. It's just really tacky.  Other than that, the club is superb.

For the nightclub, the crowd has gotten larger and larger and the space seems like it is big enough to accommodate club goers but it always feels like we're squished like sardines.

Unless you really need to listen to hip hop, avoid the jukebox room at all costs. You'll be grinding with everyone around you, male, female, or shemale. And you'll probably get in a fight with someone after being elbowed or pushed in the crowd. Expect all of this to happen past 11pm.

The main stage is still banging and is why I will come back despite what I listed above. I was here for Kaskade and it was an amazing set. You'll have fun here no matter what. If you have bottle service, even better. The outer tables are a decent size for a party of about 8 people.

What I can't stand about Marquee are the re-entry stairs. You take these to exit the club and to re-enter (obv) but they are the jankiest staircases to ever grace a Las Vegas club. Image should be everything at Marquee, and those stairwells belong inside prisons...

I had to come here one more time before I could give it a review since I was only there for about an hour due to a friend passing out because she had a little too much to drink.

I have to say that this is ""THE PLACE TO BE"" in Vegas right now.  My friends and I had a great time.  We arrived around 11PM and got right in with tickets.  If you're a guy, which the six of us were, BUY TICKETS, you won't have to pull girls from the lobby or line in order to get in and have to pay the same amount you would if you had bought tickets, plus you won't have to wait in line for an hour.  Also they no longer have you climb four flights of stairs, you take the ELEVATOR NOW!

I thoroughly enjoyed the music and the people there.   There were a lot of ladies there and the majority of them were very down to earth and not too standoffish from what I remember, but then again I was very drunk.  The staff there was also very accommodating.  As I mentioned I was very intoxicated and was stopped by a bouncer and told I would have to leave, I asked for his supervisor.  I spoke with the supervisor, or head bouncer, or whatever his job title was, I informed him that I was there to have a good time and promised not to vomit on, or punch anyone in the face.   He told me to continue to party, drink water, and go about my merry way. I obliged and continued to dance.  About 10 minutes later I was stopped by another bouncer and asked to leave due to my level of intoxication; I again spoke with the supervising bouncer and informed him I had been following his prescription of water.  He was very understanding and polite from what I remember, and sent me on my way once again.  We then danced the night away until 4 am.

It does get pretty packed as the night goes on, and they won't let you on the dance floor, but I'll give you a tip if this happens.  Wait for a bouncer to get preoccupied talking to, or chasing off a drunk individual, then slip by him onto the dance floor!",3,3,1

Marquee is my type of club. Hip Hop (downstairs) and EDM (main floor) music in separated rooms and playing real good music. The downside is that Hip Hop room was way too small, even the music was killing it and there were still a bunch of guys standing in the dance floor, holding their drinks and NOT DANCING. MOVE, PLEASE. There's a reason for the area called ""Dance Floor"", it's not ""Stand Floor"". It was super crowded every time we tried to squeeze into the dance floor. The past Saturday we got there very early and got a nice space dancing, but soon it was packed as usual. Even it's packed but I still love it.

I was in the main floor (where the world-famous DJs performing) couple times and after a certain hour, you just can't make it into the dance floor. I saw people gave $$ to the security and made their way in. Last Saturday, we were able to get in from the right side to see Kaskade. People come and go, you just need to make your way into the dance floor and that's all. Cool effects, sexy dancers and the smoke thing made the audience scream.

What I love about Marquee is that there is a huge open space at the pool area, and you can still see the DJ from the monitors. Bars are everywhere but I found it hard to get your drinks since all the bartenders are very busy. I visited here 5 times and still love it. I've been here in March, July, September. July is the most packed month if you are thinking to come here. Lots and lots of people and almost no where to stand or sit. March is a bit too chilly but September is perfect. Kaskade was playing last Saturday and it was super packed. It was probably the first time ever I experienced the full crowd. If you don't like to dance in the packed crowded (I mean, who does anyway), try to avoid holiday weekends.

In Vegas, girls usually don't need to pay for covers as long as you found the right promoter :) I've never paid for getting into the club. The drinks were expensive. $20 for a Redbull Vodka, yikes. The crowd was awesome every time I visited. Very descent crowd I would say. I met a guy who claims he is Ryan Reynolds' cousin, they looked alike, he was like Ryan Reynods with beard. I didn't believe him anyway haha.

We had the similar situation a couple of weeks before and we paid him $20 each ( $100 total ). We wouldn't mind paying sometimes if it's really worthy on a busy day but yesterday was not busy and there were only 3 or 4 people in the line.

One of our friend still wanted to go alone but he was not allowed. Tommy told other bouncers not to allow him until we pay him. Really..??

Finally, We decided not to go to Marquee again and went to XS at Wynn with DJ DIPLO. We all got in for free and had an awesome night.

- Even though we were on the guest list, we had to wait in line, just to wait in another line, just to wait in yet ANOTHER line...to be told to walk up 4 flights of stairs in 5-inch heels. One of our girls has a serious heart condition, so she cannot exert herself and we had expressed that to our promoter who told us that we were in line for the elevator. Either he was in idiot or that was a lie. Once we got to the stairs and told security our situation, they allowed us to use the elevator immediately, which is what they should have done in the first place. Took us an hour before we made it into the club.
- Standing room only, unless you're willing to pay $$$$ for bottles. (ladies, I would advise stashing flats\/flip-flops in your clutches)
- Having to precariously teeter down 4 flights of industrial stairs in heels (security won't allow you to take off your shoes for liability reasons, they would rather have you fall to your death in your pumps).

We met some nice people who offered to buy us drinks, which I turned down because I was already exhausted from waiting in line in heels and not getting enough sleep after partying the night before. I was ready to head out at about 1am...I know, very early for Vegas. 

At some point, we were invited to sit at a table hosted by a bachelor party. I didn't drink, just grateful to rest my feet. The girls were polite, only drank what was offered, but mostly engaged in polite conversation. Then, out of nowhere, the groom's deranged brother flipped his lid and started spewing hate and profanities directed at our group and demanded that we vacate their table. Everyone was shocked, including the bottle service girl who shot me horrified and apologetic looks. Insulted, we quickly left. I saw her talking to him after we took off and, soon after, we noticed the table was vacant...guess they were kicked out for being offensive? The groom also ran into us later and apologized for his brother's actions. Eh, the damage was done, but we got over it quickly. I went back to our hotel room to sleep and the rest of the girls danced the night away and didn't stumble in until 5am. 

I think I would have enjoyed Marquee more if a) they would have had a more organized entry system b) if they had a safer exit system c) if I had worn more comfortable shoes d) if I could have avoided disastrous run-ins with douchey pricks with poor manners",2,1,0

While it can get packed around the dance floor area in the house room (I've never even been to the hip hop room), hang out towards the back near the doors to the outside and you'll have a little bit more breathing room and room to dance.  I've never once felt too confined this way, but yes, the dance floor can get crazy packed; what did you expect from one of the most in-demand clubs though?

I've been here to see Kaskade, Chuckie (x2), Dash Berlin, and Arty\/Kryder...not once have I been let down. 

Pro-tip: Always buy presale! It'll save you a TON of door drama! You have to walk up the stairs of death, but only to the hip-hop room, from there take the elevator!",4,3,3

We had Avicci our weekend and we all know how bad ass he is. House and Trance is what's hot now and that is what Marquee offers. It's the hottest day\/night club at the moment in Vegas which means beautiful people that comes with it. Marquee in the Cosmopolitan resort is a 60,000 square foot venue with three different rooms that plays different music but mainly electronic.  

I strongly recommend getting a table if you have a large group. We had a group of 10 dudes and got a table right inside the entrance between the main dance floor and pool area. It was a good spot where the DJ was clearly visible and also the breeze that came in from the pool area. If you don't get a table, the wait can be hours in line depending who is spinning that night. 

The place is jammed pack meaning shoulder to shoulder when the DJ comes out, which is around 1am. This is where having a table comes in handy. Waiting at the bar to gets drinks during this time is almost impossible with all the shoving and drunks. The decor is very modern with a purplish theme to it. It's a perfect vibe to get your drink on and party! People here are friendly and attractive from the party goers to the employees. I had no issues at all through out the whole night and had a blast.",2,0,1

We came here on our last night in Vegas.  We were on the guestlist so we got in for free. I heard it's pricy if you have to pay.
There were a lot of stairs, so ladies beware, especially with those high heels we all love to wear! There were two main floors that I was on.  The house\/edm dancefloor and the hip hop and r&b level.
This place was packed, and there was a good ratio of girls to guys (even though there were more guys, but its better than when there are about 10 guys to 1 girl!). I mainly stayed on the hip hop floor and it was amazing. Near the end the dj stopped spinning for a good two minutes and suddenly edm music came on. The crowd was so mad and yelling that it finally went back to hip hop!
This place it a hit and miss for some people, but I think it really depends on the type of music you like.  I enjoyed myself because there was hip hop that night. 
I recommend you check this place out for yourself. I definitely want to go back :)",2,2,1

However it was still extremely nice, but not on the same level as XS for many reasons

I came to Marquee over the weekend with a group of about 15 people. My promoter got us all in for free and quickly which was one of the only things it had over XS which could be a pain in the ass to get in sometimes. Anyways the music in the club was mainly trance and house however they did have different dance floors and rooms for different genres. I know they played hip hop in the boombox down stairs from the main room. The crowd was very diverse which i really enjoyed. I hate how Asians are invading everywhere even though I am Asian myself. The drinks were strong which is a plus in my book because it means you would need less to get drunk hahaha.

I came mainly to Marquee because I wanted to see Makus Schulz which turned into the biggest fail ever since i blacked out. However from my friends I heard that he killed it. Marquee seems to be getting better DJ's than XS but other than that their music is the same. The main dance floor is rather small for a club that has so much hype. They closed it off around 1AM since it was so packed. Would have been better if it was more open to avoid ppl bumping you with their drinks.

The one thing I have to complain about Marquee is STAIR STAIRS AND MORE STAIRS. I have never had to walk up to many stars to get somewhere. The layout of the club was honestly designed by a person who did not care about the easy flow of drunk people and girls in high heels. To get in you need to get packed into an elevator and to leave you need to climb down like 4 stories worth of stars. Everytime i was in the stairwell I could hear girls complaining hahaha.


Overall a very nice club with good drinks, good people, and most importantly good music. However XS will always remain on top mainly dude to the wide open spaces and abundance of ramps! This is a must see club though but don't trip if you don't get in.",1,1,0

Pros: 
Good DJs 

Cons:
øWay too many stairs (especially for girls, who wear heels, good luck)
øSmall dance floors

We stood in line at 8 and didn't get to the door until 945.  Once you get in, there are 3 levels of disappointment to choose from and to get to each one, you have to walk up and down several flights of stairs.    

The bottom floor...I didn't stay on this floor long, because people were just standing around.  I didn't come to a club to stand around and people watch, so on to the next one.

The main floor was popping.  If you can't dance and want to get lucky this is the place to be.  I could barely walk to the dance floor without people brushing their sweat up against me.  When I finally got to the floor, the bouncers were telling people to move and walk the other way bc the floor was too packed.  ""That's fine,"" I thought...""There's always the 3rd room. ""

The top floor had chairs and tables everywhere.  The room was smaller than my hotel room.  What's the point of having an area where you can barely move and to get out, you have to walk around in a circle?! 

At this point I was done with Marquee.  I just wanted to get out, but it's not going to be that easy.  I felt like I had to go through a maze of 6-7 flights of stairs, to get out of this house of horror.  For anyone that is heavily intoxicated, I will pray for you.  

So why the extra star you may ask?  Well the bathroom line was real quick and I did get in the club for free.  However, I'm sure the line was short because people would rather pee on themselves before walking out in the cold and getting lost in the maze that is Marquee.

I've been to a ton of clubs, but this is by far one of my favorite clubs ever! I believe we payed over $2,000 for a table, but it was totally worth it! 
At first, we had a table in the hip hop room. Ummmm YAASS! Anyone who knows me definitely knows I love me some hip hop. Not much of the modern stuff nowadays, but that old school! And that's exactly what they were playing! Biggie Smalls? Ice Cube?! Snoop Dogg? Yes please! The entire room had so much energy. It was insane! 
Unfortunately some people in my group weren't really down with the music, so we ended up moving to the main room. I was kind of bummed until I actually saw the room. We we're smack dab in the center, and it was even better than then the hip hop room! It was gigantic and the stage in front of us was filled with beautiful dancers and colorful bright lights.
The music? Again, YASSS! Only the greatest house music ever!
I was not only very pleased with this club, but how safe I felt as well. We had security standing by our table the entire time making sure nobody snuck their way in since we had a big group.

Even if you have a table, it gets packed. The outside is awesome though! Just inside is impossible. So Marquee Nightclub over a busy weekend. I say Nay.

I went back here for the Dayclub for LDW last year and it was AWESOME. Again for Kaskade. I found this promoter Brian T and I wish I had found him sooner. He is the best promoter in vegas!

The short version of the story is that my friend was pretty drunk and stumbling around so Elsie proceeded to help us take care of her and personally walk her back to our table so we could enjoy the rest of our night. She also periodically checked in on us the rest of the night and performed her job duties with the utmost excellence and professionalism! I'm extremely grateful to her and the ladies that work in the bathroom as well for putting up with our bathroom group pics!

Anyway, this is one of the hottest new clubs in Vegas competing with XS. The layout is pretty novel. There's an elevator that takes you up on first entry. Once in, you can go to three levels. The hip hop floor, the main floor which has a pool and the top floor, which is more of a lounge. Personally, I've never gone to the top because I never knew it existed.

The best part about this club is the re-entry. Which means you can go out, get some cheap drinks and come back in. The only problem is the maze you have to navigate through and the 15 flights of stairs you have to walk down and then back up. And also, depending on the time, you may get blocked from re-entry because of the sheer amount of people. Luckily I got back in 20 minutes before they shut it off.

All in all, it's a pretty nice club. There's a waterfall in the back, pool on the main floor, dance floor in front of the DJ, tons of people to talk to and heat lamps outside for when you get cold. I can't tell you about the drinks because I'm sure it's $15 for a jack and coke like the rest of Vegas.

Alright, I know that there are 1100+ reviews for this place, but why should you read mine..? Bundles and bundles of TIPS, that's why!!
First of all, I have been here twice-- once with a table to watch Kaskade and the second time without a table to watch Dirty South. 

Tips (especially for the guys):

1. If it is within your price range, get a table. Please. Get. A. Table. A table in the Boombox room\/Library\/outside will run you $1,000 minimum in alcohol and bottles, but don't forget to tack on the outrageous 38.1% all-inclusive tax (entertainment tax, gratuity, more tax, etc etc). Our table's base with tax ran us $1381, but it was for my birthday, so it was worth it. We had a table of 6 and everyone pitching around $250 is more than worth it. Remember that cover will run you $50-$80, tack on 5 drinks at $20 a piece, and you start nearing what you would pay with splitting a table!


2a. If you elect to splurge on a table, the Boombox room is a great time; however, your party's interests may differ. The Library was calm and much more reserved, whereas the Boombox room offered hip-hop\/top 40 and several more tables. The main room where the EDM DJ headlines will run you around $2500-$3000 minimum in bottles...absolutely ridiculous. Unless you win a nice chunk of change at the tables, this one is tough to swing. 

2b. For a table reservation, we went through a promoter by the name of Amber Anderson and she was fantastic with securing our reservation, contacting us, and answering all of our questions in the days leading up to our reservation. I am sure that if you contacted Cosmopolitan concierge, they could give you her number and information. She even automatically placed us on the guest list for the Dayclub the next day where Dirty South & friends happened to be headlining.

2c. If in the Boombox room, request Bahara as your table host. She is Kim Kardashian's twin, no joke. She offered fantastic service and deserved every bit of her gratuity. 


3. If you elect not to get a table, get there early. I know it sucks to cut short your pre-gaming time in the room or wherever you may be, but getting there early will ensure that you get in Marquee in a timely manner and with a potentially smaller cover fee (especially with big headliners such as the aforementioned). When I say ""early,"" I'm talking no later than 9:40 or so. As always, a positive ratio of women to men (at least 2:1, we had 3:1) will help you, along with contacting a promoter or getting on the guest list. 


4. No matter how drunk and unruly you may feel, be extra nice to security and the bouncers. I've heard other stories about people getting tossed from here for simply disagreeing with security. 


5. BIG TIP: If you want to have ANY chance of being on the dance floor for when the headliner steps up in the booth around 1:00, you need to secure your spot on the floor no later than 11:30. Try to go to the bathroom beforehand as once you leave the dance floor, good luck even getting back into the main room (the bouncers won't have that). Security shuts off the dance floor and you could miss your favorite DJ, so get there before 11:30! 

6. Not a tip, but this place can put on a damn show! SENSORY OVERLOAD. Incredible laser\/light shows, LOVED the confetti drop (I'm easy to thrill, apparently), and the blasts of cold air alleviated the 174 degree heat on the dance floor. Don't forget the bubbles and EVENMORECONFETTI.

7. Following your EDM-coma, hit up Secret Pizza on the third floor. Perfect ending to a night of endless dancing and boozing.",25,9,6

Me, on the other hand...let's just say clubs are NOT my scene. So my review is from that perspective.

When we arrived around 1pm or so, we didn't wait in the general admission line for long. Maybe 5 minutes before being prompted to pay a $20 cover (for me) and $40 for each of the guys. I really just paid $20 to get into a pool. Yay. 

When we got in I was shocked at how small the pool area was for the amount of hype there was for this club. There was literally NO WHERE to go. No place to put my stuff. No place to lay out a towel. Actually, the only place there was to stand was in the pool. So, we went back downstairs to store our stuff. A salesman by the lockers informed us that it would be the reasonable price of $20 to get a locker. And I though the $5 lockers at Disney World were a ripoff. So yes, we paid $20 for a locker. My group of 3 is already $120 in the hole and we haven't even started to party.

Back in the club we go, and we head straight for the bar. I skipped rounds of drinks here and there to save money, but I learned very quickly I was going to need a drink if I wanted to survive the afternoon without going completely insane. I will say our bartender was great and it never took too long to get to drinks. Mixed cocktails were poured strong, and even girly drinks (like my strawberry mojito) were made with care. Total bar tab ended up around $300 for the 3 of us. 

The party itself... meh. Since we were basically stuck standing in the pool I experienced a lot of not super fun stuff. The party monitors (people with whistles?) spent a lot of time making sure the sexy party didn't turn into a frat party. We were constantly reminded to keep drinks by the edge of the pool. However, that didn't stop the water from getting nice and murky by the end of the day. 

Many beach balls were tossed around the pool which basically served the purpose of men showing their manliness by seeing how hard they could volleyball spike it towards opposite ends of the water. 

Finally, splashing. One guaranteed strategy to make sure you go back to your room alone is to arrive at  Dayclub buzzed and proceed to splash all the girls on the edge of the pool that clearly spent time prettying their hair that morning. Eventually splashing became standard as songs got hyped up, but definitely don't go around just splashing people. 

I experienced a LOT of pushing and shoving around, trying to get to the front, not moving when I shouted ""EXCUSE ME PLEASE!!"", because almost everyone who comes here thinks they're better than everyone else. I realize this is normal club behavior but for goodness sake, make a little room when a girl is carrying 3 drinks. 

I did find that the staff (bartenders, DJs, party monitors, etc) were all great. I really appreciated that the dancers were not totally slutted out, they were wearing cute one pieces. 

So basically I didn't have the greatest time. I would have really appreciated this place a lot more if it was probably half as full as it was so people could actually move around the space. Also I probably would have enjoyed it more if we had a much larger group-- probably 5-7 people is the sweet spot. 

I can understand why guys love it, because there are tons of hot girls (and if you're a gal, you better be super confident in whatever body you have, because I guarantee there will be 3408324 better looking girls than you). The two guys I went with said it was the ""highlight"" of our 4 day trip. As for me... probably the least favorite thing I did. 

Instead of spending $100 and basically not being able to move, I'd rather spend $50, relaxing and sunning on a chaise, and having a server bring drinks to me instead of fighting my way for them. But that's just me.",6,10,5

As a fresh 21 year old as of july 2011 who has had a fake id since high school who has club hopped all over LA&LV, Marquee delivers everything I could possibly want in a club. The door policy outside to actually get in, the once you get pass that velvet rope feeling that your self-esteem gets, and the amazing DJ's that create the line-up every weekend at Marquee to represent the pull they have in the world. 

Let me just start out by saying that since July, I have stayed at the Cosmopolitan four times up until this point because I love it so much. Why you ask? Because it is a one stop shop. EVERYONE in Las Vegas wants to go to Marquee...the line to get in is ridiculous. I recommend knowing a promoter or befriending one because they make your life so much easier when dealing with this club in specific.

Once you're able to get in, that velvet rope becomes your self-esteem booster, kind of like the mafia, once you're in, you're in. The main room is where you will find me. Right up against the DJ booth, whether it be Kaskade or Dirty South, the 40 ft LED screen behind the DJ booth with dancers prancing up above by a scaffold make Marquee something worth experiencing. 

House music is my life=&Marquee gives me everything I could possibly ask for in a club. You can feel the bass running through your veins as you walk in or by the main room. 

I highly recommend giving this club  a chance, because I promise you it will be worth it. The newest, hottest, and hardest club to get into in Vegas is worth giving a shot.

Marquee is so pretty on the inside as well as the outside, by the pools is what I'm talking about.

I go to every club there expecting a long wait. To top it off, I'm a dude(girls don't know how good they got it). We are treated like peasants, tossed around in different lines from upstairs to downstairs, getting cut by groups of girls or ""VIP groups' that just tip out the bouncers to get in. 

The left side of the entrance, people crowd up like animals waiting trying to get the bouncers' attention like dogs waiting for their treats. 

This place is a hierarchy. Friends of bouncers, people with money, and girls get in. Everyone else, the average joes just wanting a good night in vegas gotta pay a ridiculous amount of money, wait in line 3x longer, and literally get treated like crap.

I remember walking in line with a 3 of my male friends. it was already 1am and there was a small line in front. Right as I hopped in, he told us to, quote me on this, ""GTF"" out of line. No explanation, just get out. -_-

After three different visits to vegas, I finally managed to get in because I was part of a cousin's group that lived there, and they had friends. The place definitely does have it highlights, but I wasn't blown away. I had a better time at XS to be honest. 

Also, if you happened to not workout your legs the week you go, don't worry. There are plenty of flights of stairs to get them quads fired up.

That aside, Marquee was good but not great. I'll give it another chance when I'm back in Vegas again but I hope it doesn't disappoint again :(

From my experience, the Marquee staff is clearly racist against black people, and therefore regardless of everything else deserve the lowest rating possible.

I got a table with bottle service for my little brother's 21st birthday. Our group had 7 people. When the staff came to escort us to our table, they let the 5 people that were not black in, and then stopped the two black guys and asked them if they are with us. The guys were clearly with our group.

Then we show ID's. The girl checking ID's checks everyone's ID, and then when it gets to one of the black guys, checks the ID for a good 15 minutes, while the rest of us wait, on the other side of the ID check. They bring an extra person to check this clearly valid driver's license from Florida, while they harass us for waiting for our friends to get in to be escorted to our table.

After that we got into the club, and by the end of the night, both of the black guys were kicked out of the club, with an 'X' marked in permanent marker on their wrists so they can't get back in.  While I did not see what happened, I know everyone in that group. They are long time friends of my little brother's and they are some of the coolest, nicest people I know. They are not the kind of people that cause trouble in clubs.

It is inconceivable to me that this was a series of unfortunate mistakes or coincidences. My friends were kicked out for being black and not dressing ""white"" enough. I expect we would have had less problems if they put on a white button-up shirt, suite and tie and tried to look extra friendly and smile extra big for the racist Marquee staff. I think the Marquee staff saw two black males and assumed they would cause trouble, so they gave them as much trouble as they could and ultimately kicked them out.

This was our experience and we had bottle service. One can only imagine how the staff must treat black males they determine are ""too black"" that just want to come in and have a good time. I'll never go to this club again.",187,4,2

Although these things are very important in a good nightclub, here's what made my recent visit to the Marquee a two-star experience:

1. The feeling of constantly being herded like cattle. Ladies and gents, be warned. If you're not signing up to drop several bills on bottle service, your options of where you're ""allowed"" to be drop significantly. I was at the club with four other girls celebrating my friend's upcoming wedding, and it seemed like if we weren't in line to buy drinks or in the main dance pit, we couldn't be anywhere else. At one point, three of us were on the second floor on a balcony overlooking the main DJ area. A few minutes later, I felt a tap on my shoulder and much to my surprise there was one of the staff members shining his little flashlight on the floor directing us to leave. Really? Why? It's not like we were intruding on a VIP area or blocking a walkway. Being the pacifist that I am, I complied, but I have to admit I was very confused. An hour later, we were invited to someone's bottle-service table, and even though we were within the seating area and not at all in the walkway, a staffer was telling us that we had to move in even further. Very weird, and although I understand in a place as packed as the Marquee they need to be strict with safety measures, it felt excessive.

2. Drink prices. A few of the gals in our group decided to buy rounds of drinks for us, and for five, non-top-shelf drinks the bill was $70. REALLY? The only other place I've been with drinks that expensive is the Ministry of Sound in London, and the Marquee is nowhere as iconic as that. Ladies and gents, do yourselves a favour and get your pre-drink on.

3. The layout. Given that at least half of the guests at the Marquee are ladies wearing (oftentimes) uncomfortable heels, I found the amount of stairs and slippery, sloped floors surprising. When it came time to leave, we had to make an epic trek down what looked to be an industrial staircase. Although my lady friends and I aren't sloppy drunks and therefore had no issues, it was painful for me to watch all the young ladies try to make their way downstairs in their sky-high heels on wobbly legs.

4. The available dance space. I'll admit -I love to bust a move when a good tune comes on, but given the limited areas in which you're allowed to stand and dance, the only dancing I could do was an awkward jiggle which I now call the ""sausage dance"" -because you feel like a sausage trapped in its casing.

Overall, am I glad that I came to the Marquee? Yes, it was certainly an experience, but considering that I was part of a group of five intelligent, confident and beautiful ladies in their late-twenties, it felt strange to have our ""fun"" dictated to us. The crowd was filled with young, just-turned-21 year olds all hooched up and getting sauced, which didn't bother me as it was what I expected -as should you.",5,2,1

Thank you to Kay C.'s lovely promoter, might I add all of them were looking fresh and fine that night with their suits on. ;) Marquee is located at the top level of the Comospolitan Hotel so we had to take the elevator up. Once the doors opened and I walked out, I was blown away by the beauty and the grandeur of Marquee. The inside had three separate rooms with multiple bars for easy access, each room dedicated to different types of music. I swear to god, it was so big I got lost going to the restroom. (@___@)"" But my favorite part by far was their outdoor patio where their gazebos and jacuzzis were located. They had a screen that's linked to the indoor main house floor and a bar located off to the right. I just loved the fact that you can see all of Vegas out the side windows and the pools were dimly lit with hazy blue lights and fire lanterns everywhere to keep one toasty and warm in the frigid coldness desert nights. Multiple gazebos were located on both sides with a jacuzzi per slot, I heard these were also for bottle service, but they had to close early that night because it got too cold? Not sure if they got a refund or not... But the place is just gorgeous, I would definitely come back during the day for their day club!

BARS: Hadn't had trouble getting drinks (shots: $16), they were friendly enough to give us cups of water for free. Although once it gets packed, don't be surprised that you'd be waiting a while before you get to the front.

Most of the night I had fun, but really you have to be either drunk or buzzing really good to enjoy yourself fully. By 2 am I was sober and the crowd was driving me nuts. People were rolling and drunk, I had alcohol spilled all over my hair and my foot stepped on while I was in heels. Some guy was ramming his junk behind me and it was just cray cray. But Kaskade's performance was pretty nuts, the lights, the bass, the dancers in their neon Lady Gaga costumes... Fucking awesome.

When it starts freezing outside, Marquee Dayclub may be the only option you get but it may be better to just save your time and money.

For the most part, dayclub season ends around mid fall meaning all the day clubs start closing up shop like Wet Republic and Encore Beach Club.  Thankfully(?), if you are still interested in the dayclub experiences up until the winter months, you are in luck because Marquee is the only one that stays open.  They put a cover over the club space allowing some shelter from the cold but there are still pockets of open space.

However, what makes the dayclubbing experience so great?  For me, it is being able to stroll in without much fuss and enjoying the sun!  Sure, with Vegas it may still be sunny but as the sun starts to set, it starts to get cold.  So for those people who still want that dayclub experience in the cold, Marquee is available but I have come to find is not my cup of tea.

In terms of the actual club itself, there are only two small pools and one major bar.  Compared to the others, the space is small too.  I am glad, however, that since my last visit, they installed lockers which is located in the back near the restrooms.  The lockers are decently priced compared to other clubs ($30) and have chargers inside.

Everytime I have gone it has been relatively easy to get in so any time you want and you should not have a problem with lines.  The main DJ is usually pretty decent and they will get on stage around 2:00pm.

Overall, Marquee Dayclub is a good idea in theory but is ultimately underwhelming with nothing amazing about the club itself to compensate.",4,1,2

We got a table in the main room and just the two of us paid a little more than $4,000. We have been to Liv in Miami several times and paid about the same amount (with more people) and there is NO comparison!!!!

Some clubs make you spend an exuberant amount of money and then treat you like shit. Not Marquee. The service was impeccable. I hate being pushed around in Vegas clubs like some form of cattle but there was a security guard in our section at ALL TIMES who made sure that no one was touching our table\/that we were comfortable in-between two other rowdy tables. When I had to go to the restroom, the security guard walked me to a private bathroom and I did not have to wait at all. I was really surprised.

They let us take the bottles back to our room as for 2 people we did not finish the two bottles that we ordered. This was really nice as the security guard walked us to our room with the bottles. We will DEFINITELY DEFINITELY come back again the next time that we are in Vegas\/staying at the Cosmopolitan. The only minus was that there was a special dj for the night (that I had never heard of) and the music was very boom boom boom. There were hours where there was not one word. I love house music but this was a little excessive. We did overall have an amazing time.



Dayclub:
We went on a Monday so keep that in mind. The dayclub was pretty cool...there is a minimum to sit at any chair but I mean what do you expect from a Vegas pool party? It wasn't bad at all as it was a  Monday so we had a lot of fun. There was no DJ but the music was still amazing. We got a table right by the pool and after our umbrella fell over they moved us to a cabana in the side pool. It was really nice. The pool was a little gross as there were straws and menus in the pool which did not make it appealing to swim in but other than that the ambiance and overall scene was pretty good. If you are a guest of the hotel there is another pool nearby that you can switch back and forth with if you do not like Marquee. It is more calm and definitely cleaner.",3,1,1

I had heard it was small and lots of stair climbing and not a lot of hip hop.  But I had to see for myself.  

Okay, so I have a friend that works for Marquee so she was able to get my girls in for free and guys for $25, no wait, but we had to show up pretty early.  So we got in, no wait, no problem.

My first impression was that the place is really lux and has that glitzy, high end look.  But majority of people are not cute, at all.  Lots of grenades.  I mean a lot.  I was shocked.  Lots of janky people, really.  I didn't get the high end, big money, modelesque feel from the crowd like you do at XS.  If you're coming here looking for uber good looking people, it's not the place.  If you have beer goggles on, okay.  Docked a star for an ok-looking crowd.

We walked around the place to check things out but ended up spending the whole night posted at the bar in the Boom Box (aka hip hop) room.  It was small and the dance floor is small and really packed so we just made our own spot at the bar and partied the night away.  My good review may be biased since I was on Patron all night, so I had a really great time.

I docked another star because more of my friends showed up later around midnight, half girls & half guys.  They let all the girls in for free but held the guys back for a long time.  When the guys finally got to the front of the line, they told them they had to pay double cover ($60) then the door goons changed their story and said they had to buy bottles to get in.  I think they let all the girls in the group in first, knowing the guys would have to pay since their girls are already in.  That seems really shady to me.  

Honestly, I party a lot in Vegas and pay for tables\/bottle service but I'm growing tired of this trend of door guards basically doing a shake down of tourists and demanding tips for every little thing.  I'm pretty sure club management and\/or owners frown on this.  I'm sure there's some type of regulation that does not condone this activity.  But what can you do?",4,3,2

The first time since that original review, I don't remember much only that it wasn't bad. We came for Gareth Emery but ended up leaving early because members of our group couldn't hack it.

The second time, I came for day club. They had a ""Halfway to EDC"" pool party they threw. It was super hard to get into so we arrived early. We stood in a huge line and eventually got in. 
Everything was awesome, though super crowded. Dash Berlin rocked the house and I remember being impressed by the setup of the place more than I had been last two times i had been there. 
I also ordered some crazy nachos which were delicious but I couldn't eat very much of because I was still hung over. I still drank though, and had no problems with that. We met some amazing people and had had a great time. I'm very happy I dragged my boyfriend to it and decided to give Marquee another try.

My third time, last weekend, everything was perfect. The atmosphere was spectacular, and ATB made us dance until we got blisters on the bottoms of our feet. (Which are still killing me, but so worth it.) The setup of the place impresses me more each time I go there, I sware. I just notice more great things about it.

Oh and it helps that we never had to walk up those crazy high staircases again. That only happened that first time. Now they have a bunch of very operable elevators to get us to the needed floors.

I love Marquee now. They just blew it the first time I came, but they've certainly redeemed themselves.

The eight of us wanted to go swimming at some point of our trip. We could have gone to the pool at our resort, but since we could get into a dayclub\/beach club, we decided on that. So I hit up Scott the day before our visit and and asked him if he could put us on the list for the Marquee Dayclub. As soon as we went outside to the car so that we could head on over to Marquee, we saw the gloomy skies and were worried that it was not going to be warm enough to swim. Nevertheless, we still went on over. We arrived at the Cosmopolitan about 15 minutes later and walked upstairs to the club. Let me tell you, the Cosmopolitan is one of the nicest looking hotels in Las Vegas. That chandelier in the middle of the hotel is exquisite. We walked upstairs to the club and had to wait in a line. The manager looked for my name on the list, but couldn't find it, so he then asked me who was supposed to put me on the list. I told him that it was Scott Reading, and the manager wrote my name down on the list and told me that he knows Scott from Thunder From Down Under. He then gave me a slip and it gave us ladies free admission. Score! :) Anyway,  the VIP line was longer than the general admission line and it was divided into two because there was a walkway to the horse race betting area, and the line couldn't block it. 

Because of that, some naive people thought that the line ended before that walkway. The girls behind us were getting pissed because there were people cutting. My friend Isabel was getting pissed at this one couple that pulled that grimey move, and then they had the nerve to tell her that she was wrong. So my other friend called the manager and escorted them to the back of the growing line. We had that issue as well with other people, but the manager caught them. We didn't catch these two girls cutting in front of us, and the guys in front of them were trying to vouch for them (even though we could all tell that those two girls weren't with the group of guys). One of those girls was making some kind of comment about the line, and my friend Kerri told them that they cut the line and there were people waiting behind us longer than them. One of the girls told her to not make such a big deal about it, and then laughed. Kerri mocked that laugh because that girl had an ugly laugh. I didn't get involved, but I couldn't help but laugh inside. All I can say is that the management at this club did their job as best as they could with controlling the line. Kudos to them! :) As soon as we got to the front, we were given waterproof wristbands and escorted to the elevator. As soon as we went outside, it started to become a little cold and windy. The sun came in and out, and it was really hard to enjoy the club because of that. 

All I can say about this club is that it really is nice with all the cabanas and the swimming pool, but it was totally not the right day to be out swimming or tanning.  I think one thing this club needs to work on is the seating arrangement. For those who don't purchase the cabanas (some with personal jacuzzi tubs), they only have the options of standing or sitting at the planters. It was pretty awesome to get into this club for free, and we probably would have enjoyed it more had it not been so windy and chilly.",1,1,1

I went on a Friday night for which was over-the-top.  It was a fun crowd and I had a great time.   As I recall the price to get in was $40, drinks are $16 a pop.  So bring your big wallet!   It was nice thought that if you go to on Friday night you get a free ticket to come back on Saturday or Sunday for the pool party--which I did. 

The pool party was a completely different vibe.  They still had the bottle service and the DJ but most people found themselves in the pool and there was raucous fun.   I do recommend that you spring the $40 for a locker which is cheap insurance over losing your cell phone or wallet.  Not sure when it starts but at 3pm when I arrived it was going pretty strong already.  

If it is a special event you can reserve a cabana with bottle service AND you get your own Jacuzzi which makes everyone in the place jealous.

It was nice that there is an indoor pool party in Vegas when the January weather is 46 degrees outside.  I would guess that they keep the pool a little above 85 so there is still a pretty harsh sting of the cool air when you get out.  Even being an indoor pool the air temperature isn't exactly warm.",3,1,1

Marquee Dayclub is like that one girl or guy who ends up being smarter than you think he\/she is.. but who still is not as smart as HE\/SHE thinks she is.  Yes, Marquee was sicker than I thought it would be(having been only to the Nightclub before), but it's definitely not as awesome as the promoters and ""hottest day club of 2011"" awards make it out to be.  Having been to a bunch of the other dayclubs in vegas, I'm going to say the venue, the drinks, the food, the service, the people... meh, average.

With that being said, the shining jewel of the Marquee Dayclub is: the girls who work there are HOT.  Like seriously HOT.  Like I dont think I have ever seen groups of hotter girls before, not even on television; and that's saying something because my favorite shows include Entourage, Nip\/Tuck, and South Park (that last one is not really conducive to my point but whatever).


So does an average club with nothing to set it apart from the other clubs but extraordinarily hot girls deserve a favorable review??

In addition, we got free drinks from 8-11pm (something like that) which saved us a lot more money. However, it was really hard to get a drink because the club was just so packed. 

Ladies, don't wear 8in stilettos unless you plan on throwing down for a table. This place has a ton of stairs and even in my 3 inch heels my feel were killing me. We waited for Red Foo of LMFAO to perform and then got the hell out of there.

This club is giant, you have take an elevator up to the 6th floor and up there were 3 levels to the club. The first floor you get off of is the main dance floor where the dj is. Lots of tables and a pretty big dance floor. A long bar and the nicest bathroom ever with lots of sitting room but they don't let you sit for very long. They make you leave after a while.

If you go downstairs, it's called the Boombox. A smaller dance area with another bar playing different music than the other floor. If you go up one level from the main floor, you're at the library. Definitely just a place for you to chill and rest up, again playing different music from the other floors and has its own bars and some pool tables. From that floor, there's a balcony that you can go on that is above the main dance floor and you could see everything. There's also an outside part to club by the pool? with an outdoor bar and cabana seating. We didn't stay out there very long because it was freezing but I bet it's really nice during the summer.

The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that there's not that many places to sit on the main floor. And when it gets crowded, the walk ways are almost impossible to go through without squeezing past one another.

It's been a loooong while since I went to a club in Vegas......No, I'm not that old I just hate crowded places.  But I made an exception that weekend because it was my best friend's bachelorette party and us ladies were in the mood to party and get crazy!!

This review is a few months late but like the saying goes, ""better late than never"" right?  So let's move on with the review:

August
Temperature was about 95 degrees
Tickets were pre-purchased online 

First off, I just need to say that I was in total shock driving into Cosmopolitan.  I was in even more shock walking into the building.  It's so modern, beautiful, and trendy.....even the people there were gorgeous!! Hello hotties!!!
We were the lucky ones to get a Kaskade band, woot!  Walking into the club, I was pumped!  I was told there were several floors, one of them being a hip hop room.  

The pros:
-Beautiful venue
-Beautiful people
-Great music
-Kaskade!!
-Multiple rooms with hip hop
-Great views
-If you're on the guest list and get there early enough, its free for ladies
-Plenty of bars, got my drinks quick

Cons:
-Extremely crowded, people were shoving each other just to walk around
-Venue isn't that big
-Too many stairs, not so great for ladies in 5+ inch heels or drunkies who can't walk straight
-Not enough ventilation\/AC especially on those scorching hot summer nights
-Looooooong lines everywhere

Lows:

The scene- other than going to see your fave DJ, it's like your typical meat market vibe...people are looking to  hook up, get plastered, or even both, especially the ladies advertising their goods with cheeks and boobs hangin' out...dignity goes out the door and later, they lose the heels and walk barefoot around the club-YUCK!!!

He made sure we were on the list for bottle service and had no issues getting in! At the last minute he got sick and didn't come! I was worried! But when we got there he made sure that me and my sister were still on the list and everything went smooth! We paid 860 for a bottle of Ciroc for the boom box room. Everything went well. The boom box room played nothing but rap and hip hop just like cliff promised! We closed the joint DOWN! Cliff even texted me the next day to ensure I had a good time and that I was given the best service for my b day. Def call this guy! (586) 489-4531,0,0,0

I've probably been here over 20 times in my life time so the excitement of this club is gone for me.

-Has a dayclub\/nightclub with major EDM artists that play here regularly.

-Ladies be warned! You're going to have to walk down\/up some stairs whether you're leaving or re-entering (you take the elevator going in from the entrance) so make a sound judgement before you wear your high heels.  Ive seen many barefoot Asian girls running around after the club.",5,2,2

I dig the outdoor area because you can actually breath but the house\/Jersey Shore-ish music wasn't my scene. The main room was crowded as hell. We made our ""hand holding train"" and walked through the crowd and that was pretty much all we did there. We went to the small ""hip hop"" room and chilled there most of the time because, in my opinion at least, the music they played was really good. From what I remember, I loved everything they played pretty much LOL All in all, the club itself was nice (although, I do like the decor at XS more) but the crowd was ill and just more fun than any other club... so that's huge points.

You exceed my expectations of what a Vegas club is supposed to be even though a big name DJ wasn't present that night. Come on, admit it Redfoo is a mainstream trip hop group, not like Kaskade or R3hab. But still, I had one of my BEST Vegas nights with you...

Line at Marquee? Pshhh. nonexistent. When I'm in Vegas, I go VIP...which means no waits AND no cover even though its a cockfest in my group. Vegas is all about networking. It's all about who you know. We skipped the line and got in within 10 mins without cover. Suggestion: try to mingle & network with a promoter who can give you VIP cover & line tickets. You'll get in w\/o a hassle.

By the way, there were 3 floors of LINES. They were ALLLL long so yeah try to network with a promoter or even the club people if you can.

OH YEAH....beware of the stairs. We had to walk at least 5 flights of stairs before getting into mainstage. WTF. My legs were already sore from XS the night before, and now I gotta walk these stairs. FUCKKK.

Bottle service. You NEED to do it here at Marquee since there is absolutely no room to dance unless you're in the walkway, but then security will be on your ass about moving. BOTTLE is worth it here !! There was a 2 bottle minimum that night, and we had a HUGE group that night so we got bout 5 bottles (500+ each). Our table was by the mainstage in the middle and had ledges you can climb on and dance. The girls LOVED those ledges. As a gay guy, I felt like a stripper whore hustlin for my monayyy though most of it went towards the bottles. HAHA

We ventured around the club for a bit, and it was nice that they had a huge outdoor scene with a pool and cabanas with jacuzzis. The club felt more spacious and less claustrophobic but around 1 am...they stopped letting ppl into the club from the patio. So people had to enter through the side entrances. Um what?

THE CLUB GETS PACKED. We got sick of the craziness so we hung around our table most of the time. Redfoo dropped a sick set to my surprise though most of the night was blurry. All I remember was Bounce - R3hab remix and some Mark Knight songs.

Typical Party Rock to throw out inflatable toys during their set. Our group somehow got our hands on a inflatable animal and brought it home. Yayy !!

The people here are so damn good-looking esp the girls !! I'm not straight but damn those girls were freakin hot !! LOL

The party is hellaaaa crackin here so now you know what to do on a Mon night. PARTY ROCK !! Wiggleee wiggleee wiggleee wiggleee yeahh !!",17,13,15

Make sure you contact some good promoters though, as the lines seem to get pretty crazy. The last time I went there and left at 2am (had a trade show to attend the second morning at 8am) there was still a LONG line waiting to get in. A little ridiculous...

Because my friend is personal friends with the DJ spinning that night (I don't want to give out details for her and the DJ's privacy, but the DJ is pretty famous and has spun at Ultra and Tomorrowworld). So the DJ got us on his artist guest list and off we went!

Like last time, the place had HUGE lines that wrapped around everywhere. It was like the fucking Maze of the Minotaur that Hercules had to find his way out of. We flagged down a bouncer, he found our  names on the list and we skipped ahead to the cashier. I will make a point that the bouncers are much nicer than a year ago, so it seems like they are making an effort to change. 

The cashier was a snot. She sniffed when my friend told her we were on the list and said, ""no you aren't. It doesn't say so on your paper"". My friend ""Um, yes it does"". The cashier looked down, ""oh..."" and we were waved ahead. There are elevators now (THANK GOD!!!) and no more climbing six flights of stairs in heels. 

So we wandered around the club not really knowing what the artist's gust list was and tried asking many, many bouncers where we were supposed to be, if we even had a special place to be. No one had a clue. I suggested giving up and just enjoying ourselves. My friend tried one last guy who turned out to be a manager of sorts. Lo and behold, we had FREE BOTTLE SERVICE WHAT WHAT. 

We went to the table (yay!!) and got a drink. Not even ten minutes later, this DJ's manager shows up and states that this is his table. The bouncer\/security at the table tells my friend ""You've got to leave"". And shoves us out. =(

Now obviously a friend of the DJ's and her silly friends are not as important as the DJ's manager, and at this point I was just happy that I got some free drinks and got to skip the line, but my friends were treated very disrespectfully by the bouncers at the table. I'm not upset that we didn't get to stay. I'm upset because my friend was extremely embarrassed that she was sneered at and dismissed like a piece of dirt. 

Anyway, to be honest, the rest of the night we got over it and we had a good time (The DJ was very good). My friend is semi-famous and mentioned her bad experience to her legion of fans and Marquee sent her an email apologizing and offering her free tickets for next time. And like I said, I did notice the bouncers were more tolerable. No one screamed in my ear and no bouncer pushed me out of their way. Their promoters are always great, Brian T is a good one on Yelp to get on the guest list.",7,5,3

I've been to Marquee the highest number of times out of all the EDM clubs in vegas.  It was my first club when I turned 21 in Vegas. Since then the club has been surpassed by the newer ones like Omnia. Main reason I went to Marquee was I like the djs that have residency there.

First off those stairs...of death.  Seriously the designer of Marquee must have wanted to create a circle of hell for all of the ladies wearing sky high heels because walking up those stairs (sober or not) is NOT COOL. Maybe they just enjoy watching us struggle on the trek up those stairs.

Dance floor is super tiny and barely any room to dance.  They close it off if it's too crowded, which will happen when you see a big name dj. I've seen Dash Berlin, ATB, Kaskade, and Armin at Marquee. Drinks expensive like any club in Vegas. Like all night clubs, hit up a promoter to try to get free entry if you're female or discounted admission if you're a guy.

Overall Marquee is nice and I've had fun the times I went, but it is definitely not the top club in Vegas for EDM.",0,0,0

Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat

Marquee Nightclub was packed. The music was thumpin' and the drinks were flowin'. Who cares if there were more dudes on the crowded dance floor than ladies? We were there to jump and dance ... and after quickly staking out a spot in the middle near the front, that is exactly what we and a few hundred of our new best friends did.

Tip #1: Stay at the Cosmopolitan. Go online and book a room because it includes free admission to Marquee through a much shorter line. It'll also give you a place to freshen up before hitting the club and crash\/party afterwards. Ask for a room in the East Tower for convenience to Marquee.

Marquee Mondays makes Marquee a reason to stay in Sin City an extra day. The EC Twins and Nadia Ali performed on the Monday before Christmas and this was like an early gift from Santa.

Tip #2: Get on the main dance floor early cause by midnight it was wall-to-wall people with almost no one getting in or out. Many ""couples"" were frustrated with the tight quarters, so, come prepared for bumpin' and jumpin' with people from all around the globe.

DJ Lisa Pittman worked it at the pool while Eddie Makabi and another DJ pumped up the beats inside before the headliners came out around 12:30. Nadia did a 30-minute live set which had the crowd frothing and then the energy reached a peak with the frenetic twins.

Tip #3: Get a table if you aren't planning to stake out a spot on the crowded dance floor. If you are just wanting to chill at a club, the outdoor pool vibe and tables may be best or get one of the prime spots inside so you and your crew can dance in your own area.

Drinks are expensive ... of course, and table service is crazy expensive. Plan accordingly.

Marquee was a blast. We loved the vibe, the confetti, foam light sticks, blasts of cold air, and non-stop beats. If you get free admission to Marquee while staying at The Cosmopolitan then it is easily a 5-star night for any EDM fan.

Considering we were hotel guest at the Cosmo it took about 2 min for us to get into the club...Showed them our room key, the lady at the front swiped it and bam...we were in. 

The main stage was not my cup of tea....it was EDM and I really liked watching the girls dancing over the dance floor but EDM makes people jump. Usually these people jumping have drinks in their hands...by the law of science stated in Newton's 1st law An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Well I think you get what I'm trying to say....drinks start flying, people start getting wet...no bueno!

Given it's winter I love the way they enclosed the outside space and made it the hip-hop area. There was plenty of space to dance, it was congested, it was warm yet cool so there wasn't that nasty sweaty factor and the music was great. I had so much fun with my girls people watching. The drinks were somewhat pricey...about $20 but eh its Vegas. The ambience was gorgeous and so were many of the men! LOTS OF PERSIANS who love dark skinned women! :D *wink*

The only thing I would say that is wrong with this club is the exit....now yes there are elevators but with the amount of people in this club it takes a while to take the elevators..I was like ok let's take the stairs. OH HOW WRONG I WAS. In my 6 inch Louboutins even though I was SOBER...I was dying. What architect in his right mind would make a club with an exit consisting of I don't even remember how many flights of stairs. Apparently this architect never once went to a nightclub or experienced the hoards of drunken women in heels scrambling on to the railing for dear life.

Myself and 3 other girls followed the promoter instructions and showed up around 9 to grab a few drinks at Queue bar which was pretty comfy. Then when it was our time to head up we followed the rest of the girls in the parade up the escalators and into the house room.

The place is really cool, the crowd was young, and the waitstaff was amazingly nice. Everything was going great until we needed to sit down. There wasn't a seat to be found and all the tables were reserved, but no one was sitting there so we had no chance to flirt our way into a seat. 

We traveled up to the Library and then down to the Boom Box, but after climbing 3 full sets of stairs we were just cashed out and grabbed the elevator down. It's too bad because it was our last night and we were really excited to stay out a live it up, and I'm sure we would have if we could have just sat down for a few.",0,1,0

LOVE how I enter the club after i go through and up the elevators. People are not as snobby (IMO) and everyone was having a grand ol time!

The DJ was TEARING it up!!!!!!!! Only bad thing about this place is the packed dance floor. I could barely make it 4 feet deep into the dance floor before I'm like fuck it and escape from the can of sardines that they call a dance floor. The patio was much more forgiving, although the wind wasn't. Brrrr!

Drinks are $15 for a small glass, but if you go to the guy at the end of the bar to the left of the stage...guy has a heavy hand and will definitely get your effed up. Also, there's a table to sit at ladies! :)

Only negative is the LONG walk to get out of the club...and to return you need to take that BFE walk from the front of the hotel to the back 4th floor entrance. Really?! There has to be a better way to maneuver around here.

The Main Floor had the best music and the most crowded dance floor. The Boombox had a chiller atmosphere with music to match. The Day Club was perfect for taking a break, enjoying a drink and doing a little people watching. 

Security was interesting - there was a pick pocket at The Main Floor towards the end of the night and myself along with about a half dozen other people had items stolen - they weren't terribly interested or responsive. Again - you're kind of treated like cattle.

If EDM isn't your thing, there are two other rooms that feature different genre's of music (hiphop and top 40).  

I give it four stars because we had trouble getting in with a 5 guy to 7 girl ratio.  Maybe it was because the club is still experiencing the new opening boom, or because ATB was playing.  Even though we got in for free through a promoter, we still had to wait in line for a good three hours.  

There are plenty of spillover areas for dancing.  When you get too hot, you can head outside where there is an unobstructed view of all the surrounding hotels (the club is on the 17th floor rooftop of the Cosmo).  Drink prices are normal.

What a cluster getting into this place!!!  There are, what seems like, about 20 different lines all for different purposes.  We were lucky enough to be on the guest list and also guest of the hotel.  The guest list line was RIDICULOUS!!!  We asked one of the doormen about being guests of the hotel and a new line was created for us and others.  After waiting in that line you then move to another line and then to another line and then finally to the elevator line.  In all, I believe it only took about 30 minutes to get to the elevator which wasn't too bad.  You see, you have to take the elevator down to the club.  I have no idea how these guys keep the lines straight because it looked like a mess, but was run very efficiently.  

The club is gorgeous, ginormous, and so much fun!!!  There are 3 levels of fun...all with a different sort of theme.  I really liked the top floor with the library set up.  We also became aware of a secret hidden door on this floor...is this where the uber secretive VIP room is???  We spent most of our night, however, on the main level outside which is just the converted Marquee Day Club.  It is so much fun out there, plus the night was perfect when we were there...not too hot...not too windy.  This location also makes it super easy to get to the bathrooms and to the bar.

Anyhow, this club is a love\/hate for me.  I've been going here since it first opened and even before that.  So, I know wtf Im talking about.  

Its definitely beautiful and the color and ambience is nice.  But its too dark in the mainroom.  Plain and simple.  The traffic flow sucks only because the bouncers who control the movement are over-bearing in making people move, which isn't really their fault because its over-crowded in the mainroom and people tend to stop and stare at the stage because of the magnificient 40ft. LED screen and exotic burlesque dancers in their over-the-top outfits.  I would stop myself and take in the view.  Its amazing but the bouncer ruin it.  Many people who travel once a year maybe two are going to be in awe of watching what's going on cause it becomes a show with the world's best DJ's.  Dancefloor should've been bigger anticipating the popularity of this place.  Only good table are around it and the view there is the best but it'll set up back a few GRAND.

Tables inside the mainroom are small and expensive per person on the table.  This club is expensive overall but this is understandable being it's their first year and currently the hottest spot.  Alot of negative comments that there's alot of stairs and I agree.  A vertical club isnt the best idea for traffic flow and safety hazzards for the sloppy drunks and bare-footed girls trolling around (yuck).  

However, each room is beautifully decorated with top-notch material and the sound system is the best I've heard.  

Bottle Service isn't quite the best nor are the drinks you buy at the bar. The girls are hot but arent that attentive and do the least service as possible.  Don't expect to get her number unless you are tipping beyond the 20% auto-grad.  And she's only giving it to you to try and get you to comeback and do it all over again.  Nothing more fellas.   

Getting into the club is a effin' nightmare VIP or not.  You got the outer heavy duty barricade, then once you pass that, then you have the inner rope, then it bottlenecks to the register\/stamp regulator, then you have to wait in one of 3 roped lanes to go up elevator to get into the club.  

SO be SOBER getting in and find a spot to chill for the night if you cant afford their tables.  The outside is very nice tho, so try that without falling into the pool.

I live in NYC and have been plenty of times to the Marquee in NYC when it first opened and many times after.  Let's just say that the Vegas Marquee is terrible.  I have never seen this type of ridiculouness in my life.  As I stood there I noticed that they turned away every single person who was either african american or hispanic.  They could have been dressed amazing and looked like models but nonetheless they were turned away.  Basically, you couldn't get in unless you were white or asian. Very strange especially since this Marquee is a branch of NYC's Marquee.  The line to get in was hilarious.  People actually stood in line for 3 HOURS to get in. lol really?? Not even in NYC do you stand in line for 3 hours to get into a club.  Not even in NYC do you stand in line! lol  This Marquee has a lot to learn.  I saw a group of guys get clowned by the Marquee bouncers.  They would tell these guys who happen to be black that they were at the wrong entrance and had to go to the upstairs entrance.  When they got upstairs they were told that the line here was for people who had passes to get in - they didn't have passes.  HOWEVER, there were 2 white guys behind them that said they didn't have passes either and they were let right in.  Hmmmm....what's going on here?  I was totally disgusted by the behavior of Marquee. actually a friend called out the bouncer who said that and all of a sudden they wanted to let the african american guys get in. i guess he didn't like his character called out.  i seriously was offended with this place and am glad that we decided to leave after seeing this behavior.  i still haven't call the las vegas tourism board (if there even is such a thing) to inform them of this behavior at Marquee, but i will get around to it eventually.  they have this crap of a place all over their guides as one of the top 10 spots to go to for nightlife, but what they really need to do is put this on their top 10 spot not to go to unless you want to be offended. shame on you Marquee.

There's nothing better I'd like to say to you that hasn't already been put perfectly by Ralphie from WTTD: ""You think you're hot sh-, but you're really just cold diarrhea!""

Seriously, the bouncers\/security are the rudest ones I've ever encountered in all of Vegas. They go around acting like they're curing cancer or guarding Obama or something. As a result, they're condescending, smug, pushy, hostile. It's one thing to have to be stern with overly drunk patrons who are making a scene - but these guys are just d-bags by nature. Every time I've tried talking to them, I've been taken aback by the type of responses I get. My polite and friendly questions are always rebuffed; they smirk and talk down to me like I'm stupid. I half-expect them to pat me on the head and laugh in my face sometimes.

They walk into the girls' restrooms on the regular. They say it's to check for drunk girls. I say it's a weird and creepy invasion of privacy.

They kick out people like it's going out of style. My friend was crouching down to make a phone call so she could hear better, and they kicked her out because they insisted she was peeing in public. I swear the guards get some kind of sick satisfaction with each person they kick out. 
 
They don't let you stand in the aisles. That makes sense, sure - but sometimes I feel like you literally aren't allowed to stop moving for more than 3 seconds before a guard pops up in your face with a flashlight, herding you along, ""Can't stop here. Move it along, keep it moving."" Are we sheep being herded? Are we cars on the freeway? Can I just catch my breath for a second?

The stairs. Oh, the infamous Marquee stairs. Can we just have a moment of silence for the brilliant architect who designed a club (where half the patrons will be wearing short, tight fabric and high heels) with dark, winding stairs?? Insert confused Jackie Chan meme face.

Sure, Marquee is a gorgeous place, really new and hip. I love the pool on the roof, and I like the idea of different music on different floors. Plus, they get really big names to DJ there, so they must be doing something right. It's a decent space, eons bigger than clubs I've been to in LA or SD (but then again, this IS Vegas, so...) The experience is just completely ruined by the people who work there. 

Overall, I'd go to Marquee again if I had to (maybe for the dayclub; I've never been), but I'd pick XS or Surrender over it anyday.",6,6,2

The one thing that really sells me this place is often the forgotten part....management. Most places you'll wait hours in line, then get inside to realize that you are stuck in the middle of a corridor unable to move....not at Marquee. For such a huge headliner, the line was barely there, and everything was a breeze. You go up from those elevators into a sultry sexy club that fits with the entire sex appeal of the Cosmopolitan.  Then in every little nook and cranny, there may be an asshole of a security guard....but he makes the experience better by simply making sure everything is moving.....by that i mean crowd control is perfect. Never have I had such an easy time moving around a club this packed.

ANYWAY, next to the rest of the club....the inside is gorgeous and the center dancefloor is vaulted to reveal lights that mesmerize, and leave you lost in your ecstatic bliss ;) 
Then when you want to chill, just head out into the day club area to see an amazing view of Vegas paired with the hottest looking dayclub around. Its pools are picture perfect and all the cabanas have their own jacuzzis with glass sides to reveal all the hottness inside! At night its lit up with the fire of those illuminating columns that help keep you warm from the chilly night. Wanna keep the outdoors still vegas-y....they've got blackjack tables outside for you to blow more money on this lavish playground.

This place is HUGE, with multiple levels which I unfortunately didn't explore because i was enTRANCEd by Armin! The showmanship and surrounding dancers rivaled that of massives, in the much smaller space of a club. As for the bars, well there are many of them for you to get to, so you're not waiting in line everywhere...and the bar staff are lightning fast with drinks, even if they are some of the most expensive drinks in Vegas clubs.

In the end....ALL WORTH it. By far one of the best club experiences I have, for a large variety of realistic and party reasons! This club definitely has the money for some great headliners (ARMIN!!!!) so no matter when you go, you'll be guaranteed amazing music with a club that makes you feel a little ok with that massive hole in your pocket it makes.",1,0,1

I like the different rooms and the music they play. There's the main floor where they play mostly techno, a hip hop room and the library (I think that's what it's called) where the atmosphere is very chill. You can sit at the bar, play pool or, if it's open, go on the balcony and look down to the main floor.  

Most of the time I don't wait in line, but one time I did and it seemed a bit unorganized. They have signs, but with all the people, you can barely see them so there can be difficulty finding where to go. Plus, depending on what time you get there, the lines can be very long. Something else I didn't like is how small the hip hop room is. When I went in there it was jam packed and I was squeezing my way through people the second I entered. The dance floor is packed as well. It's super hot in there. But, if you get too hot, granted the season isn't summer, you can step outside to cool off. 

Every time I've left Marquee, I never had the smell of smoke lingering on my clothes or in my hair. Nor when I walk through the casino. They keep the place well ventilated in my opinion.

Tip 1: Go early - waiting in line sucks and the dance floor gets PACKED.
Tip 2: Go drunk - pre-party with your Fat Tuesdays on the way there because booze is pricey...so I've heard...I don't actually know for a fact since I've never bought my own drink.
Tip 3: Get your dance on early and then chill out outdoors after.

I went on two different occasions - both times, girls were free and guys were $25\/$45.  I think with it being a holiday weekend, the cover for guys was $45. Both occasions, guys suited up, girls slutted up - that's just how you gotta do it! ;] 

So there is a LOT of stair climbing.  There is usually re-entry, so I went in with my fly heels and then walked out, went to the car and grabbed my flats.   (I don't like carrying things around, so it's not like I had a bag to put my shoes in.)  There are three levels - The Library, the Main Floor and The Boom Box.  Until about 9:30\/10:00, the Main Floor and Boom Box usually are the same music.  When it changes, one is House and one is Hip-Hop.  The Library is a chill lounge area with pool tables and a bar.  The balcony of it overlooks the main floor.

The only thing that bugs me about here (and most clubs in any case) is that most of the bartenders are female.  I mean, I understand the marketing aspect of it and all because duh, it's going to be guys mostly buying drinks, but most females just can't get the drinks exactly right. *sigh* Oh well, I get what I paid for...and to date, that's nothing.

Marquee, which is in the Cosmopolitan, is the newest and hottest nightclub in Vegas right now. It's center strip so if you're not staying in the area, might be quite the trek. We walked from Planet Hollywood which is right across the street. Everyone talks about it and they get the biggest names to spin there almost every night its open.

We went for Party Rock Monday with Red Foo. I would recommend buying pre-sale tickets. My group of 4 guys didn't have to wait in line at 10:30 with tickets. Literally, check ID and walk-in. My female friends that didn't have tickets had to wait in line for an hour even after pairing up with some people. Red Foo didn't go on until 1:30 so maybe keep that in mind. The warm-up DJs are decent at best.

The design of the club was bizarre if you ask me. Whoever designed the nightclub didn't seem to think about spacing very well. The main floor where the main  DJ is performing is TINY. There are clubs in Vegas (and hell, even D.C.) with bigger side rooms than Marquee's mainfloor. That was a little disappointing. It also feels like you're always in a hallway or walkway because they've stuck tables literally everywhere inside and outside. The bouncers are pretty rude. In general, room to dance is quite limited. Outside, in December, they had these heaters which was nice but by the end of the night, half of them were off and they didn't turn them back on and trust me, it gets cold at night in Vegas. Another thing that irked people were the stairs you had to climb to get to the club and leave the club. Some were lucky enough to take the elevator but most had to walk up like 5 flights of stairs. Sucks to be a girl that's wearing heels I'm sure.

Drinks are really expensive. A beer is $9 and a Red Bull Vodka (made with Grey Goose, dunno if you can get a different vodka) is $17!!! Don't even look into a table unless you plan on dropping serious dough that night.

They definitely overpack the place. But the place is full of beautiful, young people. Barely anyone over 30 I would say and everyone dressed pretty well (even for Party Rock Monday). It's a place where people go to be seen for sure. It's definitely a nightclub worth checking out for one night and I would go back just for the names they pull there but it has a lot of downsides for what is supposed to be the best club in Vegas.",2,0,1

BUT

I dislike going to clubs.

I had no intention of going clubbing on my last trip to Vegas. However my cousin invited us with the guarantee that we wouldn't have to wait in a ridiculous line or pay cover. With that in mind, my sister and I were curious to check out the newest ""hot spot"" in Vegas so we decided to tag along.

My cousin did deliver on that promise and we only had to wait about 5 minutes before we got in also for free. Outside the club was complete madness! Groups of people waiting in line and more groups trying to sneak their way in without waiting. 

I think we got in around 1AM and the main room was playing some type of techno music. Not my cup of tea. We checked out the pool area and it was really nice. But it was also crowded. If I was rating the day club I'd probably give 4-5 stars especially if you get the separate hot tubs.

There are three rooms total: Main, BoomBox and Library. We only went to the BoomBox where they were playing Hip Hop music. Now that's the music I can dance to. However I didn't get to dance much because it was SOOO crowded! Not to mention the space is pretty small already. Also to get to this other room we had to climb some stairs. I believe I already mentioned my hatred of stairs in a club before. I swear it could be a disaster waiting to happen.

Overall I still had fun but if I had to go to another club again I prefer XS at Encore.",8,7,9

By reading the other reviews it sounds like they charge to get in. My boyfriend and I were on a list and didn't have to pay (that feels impossible to write without sounding like a jerk) the cover charge, but I don't feel like its worth a $40 entrance fee. I will say that I don't feel that there's anything else like this on the strip. 
I loved that there was a huge outside area poolside, where you are surrounded by infinity Jacuzzis. My boyfriend and I sat in a hanging eggshell chair at the end of the outdoor area for quite a while, just enjoying the show. Fun people watching.
Having a club partially outside is a great way to catch a breather, or to just choose your vibe.
 After a run to the bathroom (super fun bathrooms, worth the visit), we decided to do some dancing. The LED background is neat, I especially liked that on one of the upper floors you can walk behind it. The dancefloor however is pretty tiny for a 60,000 sq foot club, and it being that size, you get the sense that they'll pretty much let anyone in. I encountered more than a few obnoxious people, with bad dance floor manners, but I guess that's just par for the course.
They had a great light system that they didn't put to much use.

So why the three stars? One word:
STAIRS.
There's a stairwell to go up to the two other rooms at the club, one which is a mini version of marquee, a little darker, with a bar and a dance floor. The other is more of a lounge, with a euro feel, complete with fireplace and billiard tables. It's much more quiet and intimate. Its more than a little incongruous when paired with Marquee, but it was pretty empty, I think because it was around 5 flights of stairs to get their, and it was pretty warm. Only plus side is they have guys stationed at all the landings, just to make sure you don't fall down.
This place would be a disaster in a fire. Your mind cant help but go there.
Now here's the kicker.
You take an elevator to go up to the club, and you cant take one down until one am. So if you want to leave before that, too bad, you're taking the stairs. Be prepared to exit through your typical office building industrial metal stair case that goes on and on and on.....
I'm in good shape, and I had to stop a few times and catch my breath. I counted, and I think from top on the club to bottom, I counted 13 sets of stairs. Its excessive, but the upside is you'll definitely be feeling your glutes in the morning, especially if you're wearing heels.",1,0,0

New club in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel on the strip.  As you're walking towards the club, the first thing you will notice is just... how perfect this hotel is for girls, and it's actually quite smart of them.  The decor has a lot of bling, pink, red that just attracts girls' attention.  Vegas glam with a modern twist.

The club is no different.  The entrance is located on the 2nd floor and as soon as you walk in to go upstairs, it just grabs your attention.  You are brought to a House Floor where they play everything electronic.  Most of the weekends there is a famous DJ spinning on the main floor.  Huge huge LED screen right behind the DJ, so that's pretty cool.  There's amazing talent each week spinning and it's now Kaskade's official new resident in Vegas.   Keep walking, and there's an outdoor area with cabanas and tables for bottle service.  I was lucky enough to get in for free and friend had a table near the table so I got to enjoy bottle service.  The outdoor area is not as big as XS but it feels more accessible and not as random.  Of course, no jumping in the pool and I don't think the bouncers even let girls soak their feet in the jacuzzis if you have a cabana.  There's a bar near the end and the restrooms are towards the corner (mucho important).

One floor below is the Hip Hop Room.  Good music throughout but didn't stay long since friends were on the main floor.  There is a ""Library"" room above that plays a mix of everything as well.  I can see the older crowds up there.

Drinks are around $13-15.  Bartenders are nice and be sure to tip well so you can keep going back to him\/her!  At one point... I think my Kettle & Tonic was just pure... Kettle, not that I'm complaining :P  Bottle service here is just ridiculous though.  2K-3K minimum so if you're with a group of guys... tough.

Be sure to come early!  Even if you are on the guestlist, if you're not there early (9pm), you're gonna wait.  Be sure to have 1:1 ratio or else... good luck.  Bouncers are douches here, inside and outside the club.",5,1,2

Their pool parties are awesome with the DJ music, full bars, multiple pools and people!

Their night clubs are fantastic.  I went when Kasade was playing on the top dance floor area and hip hop music was playing downstairs.  You can get a taste of both music genres!  It was super crowded when Kaskade was playing all night.  This place never sleeps!  Literally.

You cannot avoid Marquee when you're in Vegas.  It is the ""IT"" place to go to!

They also have a small outside patio area, where you can take a second to breathe in the livelihood of Vegas!

The lines, however, for guestlist, can get really, really, strenuously long.  Try to beat the line by getting there at around 8pm!  Yes, 8pm!  It is super early to get into a club that early, but trust me.  Getting in line that early, is actually being on time for Marquee!  

Your whole day can be spent blissfully here!",5,3,3

Not that I had trouble getting in but I did see the line and felt bad for some of the people standing in the thousand person+ line.  Once inside as expected it blows you away.  Easily the biggest place I've ever been to nightclub wise.  Amazing music\/Dj's and dancers and environment.

My main problem was a little with the layout of the club.  It had a walkway where they had these huge bouncers (i mean of course they were big otherwise what's the point of being a bouncer right?!) standing in the middle trying to direct traffic to keep moving.  I understand the idea there but it effectivly was like taking the 405 freeway in LA and leaving only one lane open.  Traffic backs up and then everyone starts to get agitated.

The patio was where I spent most of my night which was amazing.  Very nicely decorated and there was enough room to breath and talk with the friends I went with.

The other problem I had which I expected was the pricing.  But as it is the newest and hottest club in vegas (and most likely on the west coast and maybe even all of north america! I duno) the drinks and everything was very expensive.  I guess people come to vegas to blow lots of cash but as a local I gotta stay on a regular daily budget.

I'd say well worth the experience, but it is a pain getting in so maybe try somewhere else unless you have a connection to jump the line.

Oh and I have yet to experience the dayclub but it sounds like a good time!",2,0,1

You have to take an elevator from the bouncer to the actual club. Then you are greeted by another bouncer : ) 
There are three rooms:
1st room- the ""hip hop room"" was ok. Didn't see any hot guys and the floors were super sticky from the spills. Stuck around maybe 5 mins.
2nd room: the ""main room"" was super crowded. So hard to just walk in the door. Music was so loud I couldn not hear a word anyone said. Lol. House music. Hung out maybe 15 min.
3rd room- ""the library"" has pool tables and areas to sit and lounge. Played fun music. I danced to old school Bobby Brown. Things got interesting here. And that's where my review ends.

Me and a group of girls went for labor day weekend and we got a table which was over 1400..You would think being girls they would ease up on the price but no since it was a busy weekend things were jacked up like no other. We first got a table on the patio and it was scenic but you could not hear music and the wind blew our flutes into the pool. We decided to switch our table to the library area -the hip hop room which the promoter accommodated. The hip hop room was crowded on the main dancefloor so we were really lucky to have a table off to the side otherwise we'd prolly be backed up against a bunch of drunk creepers. 

The music wasn't too my liking..The hip hop they played was straight from the hoods of compton it seemed. I wish the dj played more mainstream hip hop that would actually be fun to dance to. Minus 2 stars for that.

LOVE:

The swank is great. Love the style. Love the Cosmo actually. 

Loveliest pool deck w\/ fabulous views! Ah-Mazing at night!

Cabanas w\/ private jacuzzi are bomb! 

Lots of VIP tables. 

LOATHE:
It's almost criminal to make your guests climb 6-8 flights of stairs just to enter. 
It's a deal breaker for most girls wearing short skirts and 5"" stilletos! All you see are girls flashing their chachis up and down the stairs as girls stammer on their heels. it's a work out. I regretted my choice of shoes that night. 

Drinks are typical $17-20, a pop! 

Small dance floor. 

Very aggressive and rude security. 

There is a difference between being firm&affective as opposed to aggravated assault.  I understand the need for crowd control but when people are wall to wall, shoving and yelling in people's faces to MOVE doesn't create more space.  Especially when there is no where to move to! It's pretty simple really. Stop going over capacity and you might restore balance to the situation.

Came here on feb 9 2013 for a b day.  The music and vibe was great

Everyone here is super cool from the security to the servers!!

The only problem I had was our servers including the cup guy and our bartender at our table kept clearing the table when our drinks were still in there.

I noticed this because my girlfriend told them when her drink was gone and they said they only empty out finished cups, 

So I lost my buzz and watched them as they strategically threw out our drinks some full an some half full.

My problem with Marquee is with the staff for both the Dayclub and Nightclub.  Or maybe, my problem was that I just had way too high expectations and Marquee didn't deliver--yeah, that's it, too.

Was in a long line for the dayclub on a Saturday afternoon.  For the douche bouncer who was rude and disrespectful to our party and those in line, I understand you need to be strict and adhere to your job title, but damn, you could do away with the dirty glares and attitude in your voice.  So our party ran into trouble as we were told we were put on the guestlist but turns out, we really weren't.  The bouncer we talked to was not willing to hear our story and merely dismissed us when our names weren't on the list.  Originally, we were looking at free for girls and $25 a guy.  He tells us it'd be $25 a girl and $45 a guy since we weren't on the guestlist.  We knew another party in Vegas that weekend and they later went to Marquee dayclub and got quoted free for girls, $30 a guy.  OH, I love the consistency, thanks for NOT trying to help us, Marquee.  Also, one of the guys in our party wasn't going to be let in because he didn't have on swimming shorts...?  ""There are holes so they're basketball shorts, not swimming shorts.""  BS, they're board shorts.  Somebody tell me when did Fox start manufacturing basketball shorts 'cause last time I checked, they were a racing and surfing clothes company. So we bounced because the bouncers were being unreasonable and ended up at the pool at our hotel, I'll save that $25\/$45, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


My most recent experience with Marquee was with Elisa C. for their nightclub on a night Avicii was playing.  I expected it to be packed and a fun night, and while Avicii was pretty damn good, the rest of my experience at Marquee is something I hope to never experience again.  It's super crowded when there is a big name playing, I understand that, but WTF WHY CAN'T I MOVE AND GO ANYWHERE?  I get reprimanded by security when I lean against railings, I get hustled to keep moving when I'm ""blocking"" the walkway but there's honestly NO WHERE to go (yeah, I'll just keep moving in damn CIRCLES around the club), and I can't even sit down anywhere because the only places you can find a seat if you don't have bottle service is on those giant flower pots that everybody and their moms are hogging because their feet are hurting from standing.

The dancefloor is TINY and there are assholes who are shoving to get to the front and pouring their drinks all over me because they can't keep their damn hands still as they're moving through the crowd.  Yet again, there's NO WHERE to go because you're sandwiched between hoards of people who are too drunk to function or high off their minds.  That's Marquee on a busy night for you.  Even outside where the pool and cabanas are is PACKED.  The recurring question of ""where can I go?"" reappears and I'm left walking in circles around the club AGAIN.  Thanks Marquee, thanks.

I'd probably be less annoyed and irritated at Marquee if I wasn't in tall heels and struggling to keep my feet painless throughout the night...but when people boast about this place being a great venue and one of the top clubs in Vegas and I didn't see that, that's a problem.

I'll probably give the dayclub and nightclub another chance in the near future, but first retrain your staff and then I'll see whether it's worth going or not.",4,4,3

Overall I had a really fun time, mostly thanks to Benny Benassi and good company, but the venue was also quite nice. However, I did have a really bad experience with the bathroom attendant which I will mention below. 

Dayclub:
- Definitely one of the prettier outdoor pool areas, especially compared to Tao which we had been at the previous day. Lots of lounges\/tables, mini-pools (for decoration), and the main pool is quite large. 
- Pool's mostly empty and nice for lounging before 1pm or so. Starts to get really crowded\/amped after 3pm and then the party is on! 
- Sometimes they hand out wristbands at entry that will get you open bar from 1-2pm. 

Nightclub:
- First off, the line to get in was ridiculously long starting around 11pm. I would recommend getting there early to get in and get a wristband, which will allow you to exit and come back whenever in a separate entrance with no line. 
- The actual dance floor was smaller than I expected as the inside is mostly bars and tables. The dance floor really starts to get packed probably past midnight-1am, when the DJ is about to come on. At some points it was like shoulder-to-shoulder so you have to be aggressive about finding\/making some space to get your dance on! 
- The outdoor pool area is still open at night and great to escape the crowded dance floors. It's much cooler at night than during the day and the lighting outside is beautiful. There's a separate DJ outside who is more chill, but there are still people dancing outside too by the DJ. 
- Benny Benassi was there the night I went and he was amazing! Loved the mixes and energy he brought, and would have been perfectly happy dancing the night away if it weren't for how crowded the dance floor got.

My one negative experience with the bathroom attendant: Towards the beginning of the night, some random girl with 5"" heels stepped on my toe while on the dance floor (and didn't notice\/apologize D:). At first it just hurt a lot but then I realized it was bleeding, so I went to the bathroom to evaluate the damage and it was actually bleeding quite a lot. As I was rinsing my foot\/shoes, my sister asked the bathroom attendant for a band-aid, who coldly replied ""band-aids cost a dollar"". We didn't have any cash on us, but she still wouldn't give us a band-aid even though I was actively bleeding. Luckily, the EMT\/medic for the club came by and took me to the medic area, where she put pressure on my toe and wrapped it up nicely in gauze\/tape. After that, I was good to go for some more dancing. Still upset with that first bathroom attendant though. And lesson learned: wear closed-toed shoes to clubs!!",5,1,0

No staff was inside to tell us we're not lost. We went up like 10 flights of stairs and mind you, these looked like fire exit stairs so we really were confused. We dump out at a pool like place only to be shoed away telling us to go upstairs even MORE. Lol! So we go back to our fire exit stairs and continue on. Finally, were here. Paradise! I had a blast. It's not as crowded as Wet Republic which is a true blessing. This day club is less hype, more quality. There are two clear platforms in the pool that you can jump on and dance for the crowds!

Admission: If you are a guy, always always buy presale tickets unless you don't mind waiting hours in line just to pay extra money.

Bouncers: Typically I'm not the one to judge or criticize someone until I know them well enough but I can't help myself from believing that the bouncers here are mindless drones with little to no common sense. A friend and I went to the day club for Dash and were denied admission due to the dress code. The overweight, bald, uneducated douche informed us that we had to wear a proper ""shirt"" to get in. FYI, we were wearing swimming trunks and black wife-beaters. People with tank tops were walking in and when we questioned him, he told us that tanks were allowed but not wife-beaters. I don't understand what kind of logic goes through this drones non-existent brain but a wife-beater is simply a ribbed skin tight tank made from a different material. Plus, it's a freaking POOL PARTY I'm going to be shirtless the moment I get inside. 
My friend and I walked over to the store next door and purchased an over priced tank top; walked back into Marquee shaking our heads in disgust of how ignorant some people can be.

Drinks: It's Vegas so obviously drinks are going to be around $15.

Venue: 
DAY- Although a bit small, I always have a good time at the Marquee day party. The main pool is a public restroom but fun to splash nevertheless when the beat drops. The shallow pool with the waterfall is much cleaner and less disgusting. They have two bars you can order from and a few gambling tables. You can only sit if you bought a table.
NIGHT- Two different rooms and the outside (where they have the pool party). This place is PACKED to the point where it is almost impossible to move around. If you aren't on the dance floor by 11 or 12, chances are you'll never be able to go on it. Once you leave the dance floor, you won't be able to get back in. So at this point, you'll be forced to just chill outside if you don't have a table. This is the main reason why I don't like Marquee that much anymore. There are just too many people and you'll end up outside.

Music: Music is always good, they always have good headliners that know how to please a crowd.

TLDR: Come here for the DAY for a fun time, avoid NIGHT at all costs unless you enjoy not being able to move.

So my cousin's and I decided to get bottle service at Marquee. That was cool. We were able to bypass the long ass line and enter the club pretty quickly. When we got inside the club and seated at our table we were right behind the dance floor! I knew it would get messy over there. And it didn't help that our table was on the house floor. I wasn't really digging the house music. But whatever, I enjoyed my time there. lol. 

The room I really enjoyed was the library on the top floor. The DJ was playing old school hip hop. If I had a choice I would've liked our table to be in this room.

Bottle service was dope! Having a place to chill and drink without having to go to the bar. But we had to lock down fort on this. People will be sitting at our couch with out asking. People picking at our ice with their bare hands. WTF,  get your dirty ass hands out of the ice bucket.

Hostess: Our hostess was dope. She really took care of us. (i forgot her name.. my bad). Mixed up drinks for us. Brought us back bottles when they got empty. And just checked up on us every so often.

Security: OHHH.. DAMNNN... you know how i said it would get messy? well here is the messy part of where our table was. So I'm just chillen, sitting on the couch, trying to enjoy the music and drinking. And the next thing I know my jeans are wet. I'm thinking to myself ""WTF."" and I look at our table and some fat chick was sitting on our table and she knocked over all our bottles and ice bucket. With out saying sorry or anything, she got up with her dude and tried to hide in the dance floor. Security came to us, quick, and asked us what happen. Then they brought my cousin to the dance floor to see if we can see her. Her fat ass couldn't get far so security handled them and they got kicked out of the club. Thanks security.. Ya'll rock!

2. They need to do a better job of managing capacity, there were so many people packed in there it was a fight to get anywhere or see anything. The club also caters more to table service than other groups as the tables take up the entire space surrounding the DJ, save for a little space for a dance floor that was too packed to allow for dancing.

3. We went to the restroom, and then were told we had to wait in another long ass line for re-entry even though the bathroom is in the club?? Ridiculous. 

My group ended up getting fed up and going down to the Hip Hop club one floor down. The place is ratchet, but the music is good and there was actually room to dance and breathe. 

You'd have to pay me and carry me up the stairs to get me to go back to Marquee.",12,2,1

This is where its interesting they have 5 or 6 roped off areas to get in. One for folks who just walk-up, one for guest list, and the others I assume are for super-Vip and\/or bottle service. All these lines funnel into the smallest foyer ever that leads to the cashier and then the elevators up to the club.

Getting in was easy breezy, I strolled up gave the djs name and was given a ticket to get inside the ropes and up to the bouncer. Now I gotta say all the talk about guy to girl ratio, groups of guys have no chance well not what I witnessed..We waited maybe 5 minutes to get in and in that time I saw the bouncer let maybe 20-30 guys all  dressed very casually in, as a group of 12 good looking girls waited; one of the girls kept calling the bouncer out (not a good idea, but she eventually got it in).

Once inside...OH MY...this has got to be the best club in LV right now..huge overcrowded dance floor, but being summer the pool area was opened this was packed as well..good crowd having a good time..they have bj tables in the pool area and getting a drink was pretty easy...we were able to sit on the back rests of some bottle service areas in the pool and people were really cool about it..I think its all in the approach..

We then walked around to the other rooms and to thank the dj (Djtinat) for hooking us up.

The smaller rooms are nice and a great spot to grab a drink..my friends hit the hip hop room and ran into several Boston Celtics players..good for them..We had an amazing time time..

I do LV on the regular and I will no doubtedly be back..",1,0,2

The crowd was diverse also, and being Halloween weekend and lots of people in costume, the dress code was out the window.

But for such a large venue to only have 3 rooms (plus an outdoor patio area - which btw - doesn't matter much when it's zero degrees and the heat lamps aren't working) - one of which is more of a lounge (the Library) - it just doesn't make sense.

The lower level room plays hip hop & r&b and while the music really is great, by midnight you are like a pack of sardines. I get it - that's the ways dance clubs are these days - but isn't the whole point to be able to dance too? Just sayin'.

Another strike against Marquee - why oh why would you make each floor (and the exit) only accessible by STAIRS? Drunk people (esp girls in 4""+ heels, myself included) + walking DOWN 4 flights of stairs = a disaster (and lawsuit) waiting to happen.

But I will say this - as a person who's been to nearly every club in Vegas, Marquee's staff is as unprofessional as they get.

Yes its true - bouncers and security at Vegas must be strict for the safety and well being of everybody in the club - especially when people drink and act wild.
However, that is DEFINITELY NOT the way bouncers have been trained at Marquee - unfortunately.

I was standing at the bar buying my second drink, only 30 minutes into my night at the club. Once I turn around, a bouncer calls me over and asks me to follow him - as if I did something wrong.
It turns out that since the club is so packed, they start picking on people with the excuse of - ""you've had too much to drink""
I know this because they just stood by the bar and decided to pick on people in that area since they have drinks in their hands. Moreover I know it because they did not even communicate with me to realize I am not as drunk as the people they are trying to kick out since it is over capacity.

I was minding my own business, completely harmless.

To sum it all up - sad, ridiculous, lame, unprofessional and most of all - INCOMPETENT

Main floor = EDM, usually a big name dj
Bottom floor, ""boombox"" = hip hop

The only con is that the dance floor is ridiculously packed, but being a girl, it's easy to get into to. You'll just have to leave your guy friends behind.

Cover is free for girls and if you know a promoter, you'll get walked in. Guys, buy the presale cuz the girls do not want to wait in line with you, as you need ratio to just be standing there.

Yes the music, ambiance, and drinks make a difference. But we all know what really makes a place pop is the people there. I've always said that all the really matters is the people you are with, but we all know everyone wants to go to the poppin' places. Currently Marquee is that place. The line can get pretty crazy and the tables are crazy expensive. However, the venue is very nice. The decor is done really well. They have both outdoor and indoor areas, with many rooms with varying types of music. No matter what music you like I'm sure you'll have a good time at Marquee. The drinks are pricey, but that holds true at most nice clubs. The thing that I really like is that marquee gives you the option to pre-purchase tickets. This allows you to pretty much bypass the line and get in much quicker. The disadvantage is that girls also have to pay, but I think its worth it. Paying 70ish dollars is way worth it to get in quickly without having to drop $1500 for a table. It allows you to avoid everyone trying to get in via guest list etc.

Marquee is the happening club in Vegas. If you want to go here I suggest buying pre-sale tickets or a table, as the line gets pretty crazy. Common on your in Vegas just spring for the pre-sale and save time. The tickets cost about the same as a few drinks. Jut buy the tickets, pre-game in the room and have a great time in the club by avoiding the long wait in line!

The only disadvantage to this place it that there are many stairs. So ladies try to wear comfortable shoes or your feet will be hurting at the end of the night.",1,2,2

PROS:
--2 dance floors = twice the fun. They have hip hop on the lower level and house on the main level. The hip hop floor can get crowded, but that just means more to love ;)

--free places to sit- no table? No problem! Outside, Marquee has lounge areas for guests to relax and sit. The upside is that it's free; the downside is that it's free... meaning that a lot of other people will also be sitting here.

--relatively easy to get in- no long lines, no $$$ covers for boys. 

CONS:
-- too many Asians. Speaking as an Asian girl, even I feel like there are too many Asians here!! But, hey, if that's your thing... go for it :)

-- VERY CROWDED- like many (relatively) new Vegas clubs, it gets really crowded after 12am-1am :\/ 

-- weird exits-- the club itself looks really nice, but what happened to the exits? The floors are not carpeted (aka not heel-friendly) and there are many flights of stairs to walk up and down just to get out!

Despite this, I tried to have a positive outlook, and just tried to enjoy myself.  Our group decided to get bottle service since there were so many of us.  The table had a $1,000 minimum in order to get the table.  We arrived at the club a little before noon.  We were able to get in through the VIP line since we got the table.  Upon arrival, I was told by several staff and bouncers, that my basketball shorts were unacceptable.  Great... They told me that I could purchase shorts from them for $60.  I had no other choice, so I went along.  We then entered a room with about four or five other tables.  Inside was also a bar, with AC, which was a plus since it was so hot outside, and the it was only going to get warmer throughout the day.  

After we got situated, a bunch of different people came to greet us.  I honestly felt like such a VIP because they were introducing themselves to us, and accommodating us in any way possible.  We decided on Ciroc and Jameson which were about $450 each.  We also ordered some fries and a pizza, which were a great snack considering we did not get the opportunity to eat breakfast yet.  And just like that, we reached the $1,000 minimum.  Luckily, they forgot, and  did not charge me for the shorts that they were so adamant about.

If I could separate it I would give 5 stars to the Dayclub and 3 stars to the Nightclub. Why you ask?

Well they are combined, yes, all one, both stages are opposite of one another, one inside, one outside. Both were open when I attended the nightclub and when I attended the next day at the dayclub. So, that is kinda cool... you can go in between both no problem and when you are inside and SO HOT, you can walk outside to get some fresh air or if you are outside and SO HOT, you can go inside (during the day) and cool off.

Positive things about Nightclub:
- Amazing sound system

Negative things about the Nightclub:
- PACKED inside beyond belief. I know that they think they have more room since both areas are open but if you are there to experience a certain DJ, more than likely you want to be inside, right? So it was packed so much that they were not allowing you to enter the main dance floor. There were employees everywhere telling you to keep moving - you could not stand anywhere near the dancefloor if you were not in the thick of it... which was cut off. However, my friend slipped the dude $20 to let us on the dancefloor, that worked (which made me sick to think about, how rude!!) however, when he requested to go use the restroom and come back, the dude asked for $60 more from him and any of us that had to use the restroom... ABSOLUTELY ABSURD! ""Security"" pocketing money when they should be there to, oh I don't know, keep everyone SAFE?!?! Terrible business antics I witnessed. I had to hold myself from not slapping some sense into the security dude. And some of you may be thinking, this girl has no idea what a club like this is for... and I do, it's a ""high class"" club that makes money off the VIP guests, well that doesn't mean you should be rude or offer different service to people who paid to get in the door and enjoy a night with their favorite DJ. Sigh... so sad. 

Negative things about both:
- $8 water. WHAT? Yep $8 water. That should be illegal. Towards the end of the night when they are counting their HUGE $$ Bills... they will just give you a glass of ice water, how nice?

- We had a ""special"" bracelet, as they have different package levels, specials etc, and our allowed us access to all the shows over LDW and each and every employee, the three times we went, had different information on what were allowed to have access with it. Some gave us VIP treatment, others had to ask 3 other people if we were even allowed in, it was a hot mess but I know overall it was appreciated since we were ultimately given correct access but we should not have had to jump over so many hoops to get what we had the right to receive. 

And the Dayclub is just an entire different beast! Yes, they pack people in but some are there for their VIP\/Pool experience only and others for the DJ experience. I stood right up at the top bar next to the DJ booth and had room to dance and enjoy the entire day, lovely, just lovely. I appreciate that they had lockers as well!

The day club is pretty amazing especially with bottle service.  For a larger group of doods, its definitely more chill in a spot so that you can just sit back and kick it or party in the pool when you feel like it.  The hostesses are all amazing and very accommodating.  Partywise, the tracks are good and the crowd is definitely in the mood.  ALSO, they have food!  Pizzas are good, fries are good, JUMBO SHRIMPs are AMAZING, even at $19 for 4 pieces, its definitely worth it.  The pitchers of mohitos are definitely refreshing and does the job to get that buzz going, but if you need it, just get a bucket of beers.  

At night, its hard to say what goes on in the hip hop room, although having stumbled in there a few times it was pretty cool.  If you're drunk and walking around though.....you might get lost.

We climbed, legit, like 9 flights of stairs. Imagine doing this in heels and a dress. It was awful. I felt like we needed to stop for food and water! 

We finally arrived to the entrance to a packed house. The club is a great size and easily accessible to get a drink. Took me all of 3 min to get one.

Again we got the hookup and got to bypass the long lines on the second floor. I think we came at like 9:30pm which is so early by Vegas standards and the line was already like 70 people deep. It's cray cray. Haha. First off since we went through a special entrance, we had to take multiple sets of stairs to even get up to the club. I heard that there are usually elevators if you go through the normal entrance. Furthermore to get between the different rooms, they were also on different floors so you need to take the stairs. Stairs are tiring enough - try climbing them all night long with sky high heels. They need a better system or layout. We had also gotten there early and it wasn't quite so busy yet so we hung out outside by the pool. This was my favorite part because it so cool there and it's the rooftop so there's pretty views. The pool was off limits as far as I could tell but a couple of drunk people jumped in a little later in the night and I didn't see them reprimanded or anything. Although we pre-drank, we still had to get something at the club. They only had blended red bull vodkas, which was odd and each drink set us back $16. Ack - but expected and normal prices for Vegas. The main room is cool but it can fill up fast. They play house music there which is ok for me but can sometimes be hard to dance to. But the DJs always look like they're having fun. The whole screen behind him is like LCD\/LED screens which has cool graphics showing the whole time. Lights and lasers are going every which way. It really feels like a club. I much preferred the music in hip hop room but that place is super tiny. And we spent like 15 minutes in there getting pushed and pulled and jostled before finally getting fed up with it and leaving. It's not even dancing if you're just moved by the crowd, getting more and more smushed like fish in a tin can (is that an idiom?)

Your friends and alcohol :). Just because you had a good time at the end of the night doesn't mean the club was great. My case in point...

This place is crazy. We went on fri night with no table service and on sat with table service. $30 for guys and $20 for the girls on Friday. You get one free admission plus a free guest if you have a room at the Cosmopolitan.  Lines are long even if you are getting there early and you're in the hotel guest line or the table service line. Both nights we had problems before getting in. On Friday they had told our friends who had a room and a suit there that there would be no prob getting in and that it was free. Bullshit. They almost made us get in the gen admission line even with room keys. Our friends had to make a scene. On Saturday it was BULLSHIT at the front AGAIN. We had a problem with the amount of people we had with us. I don't know if it was a miscommunication or what. They bumped up the price and put us in a cabana instead of in the main room. They also gave us grief about having more guys than girls even if we had a table. I think the total was $4500. Pretty steep. Last I heard before we got there it was supposed to be in the $3500 range for our party. The cabana they put us in was all the way at the back so we couldn't see much of the crowd. After the drinks came out it was a good time though. Our hostess, Alicia was very friendly and my boys were in love. LOL I didn't care much for the music in the main area or outside (same music) which was house, I think. The hip hop room was playing good stuff but it can get cramped in there.  The club as a whole is HUGE. Plan on doing a lot of walking and lots of stairs if you wanna see the whole place.  

If I was grading atmosphere\/layout of the club and our hostess alone, then maybe 4 or even 5 stars. Even the table security was cool making sure if we wanted some of the extras there or not and keeping the unwanted out. The assholes in charge of the lines are a MAJOR flaw though. I just feel like if you're putting up money for bottle service or staying at their hotel, you should be treated better. It's not like that at other clubs we've been to.

My thoughts are that you go clubbing to drink, dance and have a good time. Well, you can do all that for less $ and less hassle almost anywhere in Vegas other than here.  At the end of the night, the fun that was had was equal to the fun we've had at other venues but that was because that part of the equation stayed the same (friends+drinks). It was just more expensive and less pleasant at the door\/line. I guess it's a good thing to experience the different rooms and the layout of the club but I don't think we'll be going back there unless things change out front.",3,1,0

I didn't realize why at the time, but at the line the crowd felt a bit... ""Dramatic"" to me. Like a casting call line for a Jersey Shore set. I had a strong urge to punch someone, in particular the weirdos with the neon glasses or one of the ""bros"" with Affliction shirts.

I did not like the crowd AT ALL! I don't like how they talk, how they dress, how they look or their retarded conversation subjects. Who really wants to hear some ""logical"" debate about weed legalization for the 15th millionth fucking time? Their personalities rubbed off as a chronic liar. And drug addict.

Inside the club, some random lady BODY-SLAMMED into one of my female friends ON PURPOSE! What the fuck? She will tear out your smooth lotion-ney throat with her damn teeth if you fucking cross her again!

Now I wrote rave reviews of XS, because of their great production budgets, lineups, and most importantly, CIVILITY! But I can't say the same for Marquee, because its a lot of flash, money and big name DJs, but literally nothing about the quality of the people that come in here.

When I went down the second level outside of the hip hop room for a smoke, these two spun out looking cougar ladies wouldn't stop poking me with those padded glow sticks. They tried starting conversations with me while failing pretty badly, and a lot of what they are saying they realized they were offending me (they came off as ""rude""). Then the girls I came with found me and rescued me.

There was a HUMUNGOUS and hot amazon lady that kept staring at me on the main level. Now, I like a lady I can piggy-back all the way to the bedroom (or in other cases, being carried all the way up there LOL), but as I approached her I immediately got intercepted by these seriously nasty looking meth head women that were really aggressive in ""breaking the ice"" with me.  In like... 40 seconds they asked me where I am from, what do I do, and whether or not I can take a picture with them. When they finally are gone, Xena was no where to be found :(

But the WORST part of the club is THE STAIRS! 

We had a nice, calm, elevator ride IN the club. But to get out, and that goes for all of you, you must take THE STAIRS. It's EIGHT levels of not tripping over drunk bitches that can't walk in heels (and forgot their sandals). 

There were bitches that decided to sit and lounge at THE STAIRS!!! Get the fuck out the way, your holding up traffic! 

When I woke up today I thought over about what I experienced at Marquee the day before. Then it hit me. Half the people inside the club were HIGH! The flushed faces, bloodshot eyes, sunken Crypt Keeper like cheekbones, ridiculously stupid and creepy behavior, and seeing bouncers escorting people out the exit every 5 minutes. Apparently there is ALOT of dope flowing through this venue. 

On my way out to the parking garage elevators, this dumb midget motherfucker tried to block my way with his hand for ""one of his bros"" that was staggering around like an idiot. I blew right past him for being an ass, and he started stumbling. 

I fucking hate Cosmopolitan and the Marquee. This is the spot where scumbags hang out and get a quick stay at the Clark County Jail.",7,14,3

So many stairs and the rooms were very small. In order to get to the first room, we climbed one too many flights of stairs (I think it was like...the 5th floor or something ridiculous like that). The hip hop room had a great DJ who spun everything from current top hip hop hits to classics that hit home. The dance floor was extremely tiny though! We had to climb another set of stairs to get to the main floor where Kaskade's set was. Unless you had a table, you are constantly standing and bumping into everyone. The main dance floor has bouncers who keep you moving through the club. They pick and choose who to let in to the main dance area in front of the DJ. if you aren't able to get in, you are forced to keep moving until you are pushed outside. Lucky for me, I was able to get into the middle with a few friends, but part of my group wasn't so lucky, so we got split up. When Kaskade came on, it was super fun, until it got way too crowded and everyone was just packed in like sardines. Didn't help that the people next to me were doing cocaine on their credit cards in the midst of everyone sweating and farting profusely on each other. After a good 30 minutes of jumping up and down, we decided to leave. To me, that wasn't worth $50 for the guys. I would choose a pool party over this nightclub any day.

Assuming it was maxed to capacity, we continued to party outside.  A few friends got separated to use the restroom (outdoor restroom blocked off), and were able to go inside through the side door.  Unable to get back out, they asked security for directions to join the group outside at the pool area, only to be directed to the elevators to leave, 5 times, by 5 different security guys while none of them bothered to tell them they can't go back out to the pool area.

The rest of us decided to leave this place, only to run into our friends by the elevator.  Some wanted to stay because it was still early... 1 am!  Were they able to?  No, because security kept flashing their stupid flashlights directing anyone walking in the walkways to exit.  

We later heard from some people that Marquee is known for closing early during winter season, and that it is common to close the outdoor patio area early, resulting in overcrowding in the dance floors on the inside, so they try to give people the boot to make room, so whoever is still waiting in line can go inside.

All I've got to say is that I've never experienced this at XS or any other major clubs in Vegas.  Marquee, you may be new but the chance of my group of friends going back is very very slim.  The way you guys operate your business, especially on a Saturday night, caused much frustration and anger throughout the night.  My friends have even told me stories where their friends had the similar experiences, causing nothing but frustration.  Being the newest club on the strip is what's bringing people in but once the hype is over and Marquee's reputation is tarnished, there's no need to wonder why.  

To be fair, the decor is gorgeous and to sum up the view, it's an urban oasis BUT THE EXPERIENCE HERE IS DEFINITELY SUB-PAR!",1,0,0

Great music, swings (or were the chairs seemingly swinging the night I was there?), and free drinks... in hindsight, I'm a woman so free drinks may not be universal.

The night was even better because I had an awesome wingwoman who thoroughly prevented creepsters from hollerin. (Where was she when I was in Vegas in November 2010?) I think it helps that I'm from the Bay and that I know how to move to the bass line as opposed to the people who swing their hips and hair wildly in the hopes that they look hot (they do, but dancing is a different story).

Back to The Marquee - honestly, I got in for free, didn't have to wait in line, and all I can distinctly remember is debating with every person that approached me on the dance floor. But that's like any other club experience I've had in Vegas.

There were girls EVERYWHERE; seriously the girl to guy ratio was probably 5:1. I felt like a sorority house exploded. Maybe I went on a good night or maybe all the ladies just love Robbie Rivera ;). 

The nightclub has three floors (4 - 6). The 4th floor spins hip hop; I would have loved to stayed in there longer but the room was packed. You can escape to the patio where they have speakers bumping or make the trek to the other floors using the stairs.

The 5th floor spins house and trance. They have one dance floor and tables lined up all around the floor. if you reserved a table, ding ding ding you're a winner. If not, no biggie, you'll have fun exploring the nightclub anyway.The 5th floor also features an outdoor\/balcony area. When it's cold out they have these chic heating lamps in the shape of nightstands. Go out here, have a smoke or get some cold air after tearing up the dance floor. 

And last but not least, head up to the 6th floor to play some pool, lounge a bit and listen to some late 90's music OR, if you want a better view of what's going down on the 5th floor, sneak off to the balcony and get a perfect view of the DJ. It's a great spot to just chill - you'll have plenty of room and it's not crowded. 

Quick Tips
- if you're coming here for a special event, buy your tickets online then when you arrive, present your email confirmation to the ticket booth located on the first floor. Tell the Bouncer you're there to pick up your tickets then go upstairs to the second floor and report to the Ticket Holder line. 
- This place has STAIRS. Be prepared. Ladies make sure your stilettos are not only chic but super comfy! Don't be that girl that falls on her ass cause she drank too much and nobody wanted to catch her. You know what I'm talking about - you've seen it, you laughed, you pointed.

If you are in Vegas to satisfy some checklist of stuff that you saw on the travel channel or celebrity gossip, then your purpose is obviously different, so proceed...but ye be warned. Personally, I went in with no expectations but still came out utterly disappointed.

Pros:
Packed with people
Excellent bottle\/table service
Multiple dance floors with different music genres
Great view of the Strip

Cons:
Packed with people
Rude bouncers, door people\/security, and management
Very long lines for everything

I went to The Marquee Club without knowing a thing about it. We had VIP table reservations, so I figured everything was going to run smoothly, until we got to the Club. There were nearly 500-600 people waiting in one line and another 300 waiting in another - I thought it was because we were early and the doors weren't open, but it was actually because the Club was already full. The longer line was for people without table reservations: they let you in when space opens up (slim chance) as ""standing room only"" for a hundred dollars cover. The shorter line was for people with table reservations: they have limited number of tables so you have to wait until one opens up, but at least you're guaranteed to get in.

The club was packed with people - sardine can tight. It was impossible to find a place to dance on the dance floors, let alone walk through them, and a lot of people ended up dancing in walkways, near the fences, and other odd areas where they could find enough space to move around. Some people danced near a chain link fence without even getting a sniff of the dance floors. By the way, there is no place to sit if you don't get a table, and drinks are expensive. Only when I'm on vacation will I think that spending four thousand dollars on a bunch of bottles is justified - just to have the convenience of couches and an area to dance.",2,1,2

(3.5 stars)

My cousins and I came by on a Friday at around 11:30 p.m. When we arrived, it wasn't terribly crowded. The house DJ playing that day stuck to EDM, but had a bit of variety here and there.

Venue itself isn't entirely large. I really wish they had more seating\/standing space, especially more space for dancing. I'd highly suggest grabbing a table if you can.

Bartenders are accommodating. Wished they could mix their frozen drinks a bit better.
Prices for drinks are typical, ranging a bit above $15. However, they give free, cold water. That's a winner in my book!

Overall, it was a cool pool party. I just wished this venue was a bit bigger.",0,0,1

Usually this means waiting in intolerable long lines, paying peak period cover charges (yes, ladies, too) & perhaps not even getting in. 

It's times like this when it pays to know people who can make miracles happen. I wouldn't even bother coming, otherwise. Let me take this opportunity to extend my appreciation to all the rad people working in town who help facilitate the fun & minimize the bullshit. Everyone knows I don't do lines or cover..which is why I don't go places unless I have a connection. So, thank you to all of my friends in town.

So, Marquee..not as big as I envisioned. You take an elevator down to the main room (2nd level), which is the largest of the 3..strictly house\/edm with a bananas sound system & all kinds of fancy lights\/lcd screen flashiness going on. 3rd level is the boom box room: dark, simple and hip hop. 1st level is the library..decor is self explanatory..a good amount of leather seating and a pool table. Loungey music. There is a catwalk you can enter from this level that overlooks the main room below. This is the room my group & I stayed at for the duration of the night\/morning on NYE\/NYD..and we didn't leave until after 6 in the morning or so. Morillo was spinning and he didn't stop until about 10 a.m. from what I hear. That's one great thing about spending NYE in Vegas versus L.A.: The party doesn't stop two short hours after midnight. 

On NYD night, my girl, Chanel D. flew in and I took here here for our 3rd stop of the night. Again, stayed until about 6 a.m. Both nights got in with no sweat. Had a great time dancedancedancing the night away. Had a blast. One of the best NYE\/NYD's I've had. 

Looking forward to checking out the dayclub portion come spring\/summer time with my beautiful ladies. That means you, Marian B. And you, Chanel D. And you, Sade J. And you, Joanie G. + giraffe fam. 

Ah, nightlife. Always in it for the dancing & good times with the girls and shunning all the douchebags, assholes & jerk-offs.

It's normally $50 for guys (!) and $20 for girls, which is just ridiculous, but whatever. And the way they have you get into the place IS weird! Going up and down all these stairs and whatnot. But once I got in I liked all their different rooms and areas. They had a smallish dancefloor and bar right when you get in, and they have the main massive floor and stage which opens up to the pool area, which was pretty impressive. Then they have a small ""library"" on the uppermost floor that was mostly pay tables and seating areas, but also has a pool table, fireplace and a teeny dancefloor. They do have shelves going all the way around with actual books, and the female servers are rocking the sexy librarian look, which was pretty funny. But they were playing some mellow hip-hop and funk, which was a nice break from all the EDM shenanigans in the other areas and we ended up finishing up our very late night here. One thing to note about this area: unisex bathrooms. Which sounds all egalitarian and whatever until you happen to go toward the end of the evening and find that someone (probably male) had peed ALL OVER the toilet, floor, and possibly the walls--EW. The rest of the bathrooms are safely segregated.

It happened to be a super-busy weekend because DJ Dirty South was in town and the place was PACKED. Unless you buy one of their stupid tables or were manning a spot on the dancefloor since the place opened there was really nowhere to hang out, and you were constantly being forced to move by the security goons and their little flashlights. We'd found a nice little corner by the stage during the main set but were of course shooed out of there after about 30 min and had to wander around the club like displaced Israelites for the rest of the night. Hanging around outside wasn't too great either because it was so cold. I can't imagine how crazy this place must get during the summertime. Anyway, since I don't frequent places like this it was certainly an interesting experience, and my friends and I made the most of it.

My friends and I decided to get the ""All-Access"" pass for the weekend which gets you two nights at the club (we only did one), and a dayclub  pass.

Bouncers here are still rude as hell from the last time I came here. No one here knows how to talk, apparently. They just vague nod or point into generally areas with no real rhyme or reason.

-Nightclub-

We came here Friday night and it was a freaking struggle to get into the club. It's like freaking adult Disneyland except I'm not going on Space Mountain.

Anyway, there's a line to get into another line, to get into another line, to get into an elevator and then FINALLY you end up upstairs.

The saving grace was the outside patio and the music. It wasn't too crowded. I was still able to get on and off the dance floor without too much pushing and shoving. 

-Dayclub-

The Dayclub was a freaking experience. It was my first time here and I actually really did enjoy it.

I highly recommend getting: 1) a waterproof pouch for your valuables, 2) a locker for your clothes\/shoes (it's $30 but I'm about to tell you why it's worth it), or 3) bring cheap shit you don't mind losing.

Dayclub was FUN tho. It was probably one of the best times I've had. A lot of people have cabanas or end up just hanging around the end of the pool so it's not as crowded in it as you would think. Carnage was set to perform that day but I think we left well before he ever showed up. The water was a little cold and the wind didn't help. But a couple of drinks and a few splashes at the drop later and you are good to do.

Now, here is where the locker comes in handy. We left our stuff on the ground by the pool with everyone else. When we left to take a bathroom break my flip flops were gone with the wind. Would've been nice to have them cause the floor is balls hot.

By the time we left, my other friend got his shoes and his shirt jacked so he ended up barefoot and shirtless.

And you HAVE to have a shirt\/coverall on when you go back into the Cosmo so it's not like you can just roll up without anything on. So, a locker might be worth the $30. It's an all day use so if you got the passes like we did you could go back and use it and opt out of coat check or something.

Bouncers are still rude.

I think if I went to Vegas more often or had been a lot of times and really wanted to try a new club, I'd be more excited by Marquee. As it is, I'm still pretty new to Vegas-I went to Marquee on my third trip and was kind of disappointed. 

Because it's open to the pool area (much like Surrender), it's a little miserable in July... it was 107 degrees outside when I was there, so even with blasting A\/C the inside was maybe 85 degrees. Still considerably cooler, but also much too warm to make dancing on a packed dance floor enjoyable. 

My boyfriend and I paid $50 to go on a Monday when LMFAO (or half of LMFAO, just Redfoo) would be there, but we bailed when around 11 when we had been in line since 9, in the club since 10, and we heard that he typically doesn't show until around 1. Maybe the people we overheard didn't know what they were talking about, or based on my little experience , I get that's kind of the standard for Vegas hosts but again, maybe if I was a more seasoned Vegas visitor I would have known to hit up somewhere else first and come to Marquee later to make it more enjoyable. 

All that said, the music was great, the interior and pool areas were absolutely beautiful, the bouncers who bring you to the club in the elevator were super fun and high energy...

However, you're not allowed to take the elevator because the big security guys in suits and shades forbid you to.

This was to be one of the most epic nights of my life. I had spent a few other nights at Marquee and knew the potential party they could throw. Reed had verified that I had a reservation for an INDOOR table that evening for my group. I had been in contact with Reed several times during the day via text message.

When I arrived, the host assigned to us informed us that we would be moved out to the outdoor cabanas at the same price as an indoor cabana. The temperature had dropped to about 55 degrees and there were 30 mph winds outside due to the changing weather and location of the club on top of the building. This is obviously totally unacceptable. 

They then offered to drop the price slightly... I told them that there was no price in which I would take a table that was in the middle of a hurricane. They told me that I had to decide whether to take the table or not in 2 minutes or we would be asked to leave. They informed me that they could not offer to let us stay in the club, despite them changing things on us. 

Their rationale for the change was that all tables are based on demand. Then WHAT THE F IS A RESERVATION FOR!?!?!? 

There was no mention of tables being subject to change before arrival, only after we had entered the club. Not even an indication that things might change via text message during the day when I had communicated with Mr. Reygadas. This was clearly a case of people with outside cabanas wanting to move indoors and willing to pay top dollar to do so. We were not even given the opportunity to pay more for an indoor table (I wouldn't have). 

After much arguing, they approved to let us stay in the club but would charge us $50 cover per person. 

These individuals completely ruined my huge, once in a lifetime evening because of their greed and shady practices.

OH AND ONE MORE THING. I had just got done spending well over $2000 at their sister club, Tao, the evening before. And this is how they treat me? 

All in all, my friends and I have probably spent in excess of $20k at the Marquee and Tao establishments. 

This is how they treat people. 

DO NOT MAKE ANY PLANS THAT RELY ON THE VIP STAFF AT MARQUEE NIGHT CLUB. 

Thank you for ruining my trip, Mr. Greed Reygadas... this was the worst experience I've ever had in Las Vegas. You all should be ashamed of yourselves for undertaking such deceptive practices. You all are grossing plenty of revenue every single night... you don't need to take advantage of people who are ready and willing to spend ungodly amounts of money at your establishment. 

I can assure you that you have lost plenty of future business from me. I cannot have that night back and there is nothing you can do to give it back to me. You should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves.

If any of you reading this review have any self respect, do not give your money to these greedy heartless individuals.",28,4,2

We went to go watch DJ Khaled and while I am not a fan of his as much as he is a fan of himself, I am still a fan. He put on a great set, he wasn't only up there for an hour like a lot of other inconsiderate and egotistical DJs have been (i.e. Calvin Harris & the chainsmokers). 

One thing in particular I want to note that I was a fan of at marquee, the option of being both indoors and outdoors. You don't know until you experience A saturation of body heat and body sweat around you how beneficial going outside and feeling a breeze can be. We got a table set up by the pool area and the bottle service was fantastic, Joe the VIP host was fantastic, and we all got silly.

Luckily Marquee is open on Thursdays so that made the decision a little easier.  I tried to sign up on the guest list for last Thursday on the site but it wouldn't work so I called up the club & got put on & the guy first told me to get in line before 12 & then he told me actually 11.  With Strip traffic & us running a little behind we got to Marquee about a quarter after 11, but saw the non-existent line & didn't even mention the guest list; which I don't think would of matter because it seems like guys always have to pay anyways, so the guys had to pay $20 & we girls were free!

Only the Boombox room is open on Thursdays which was kind of a downer since I heard about how wonderful and huge Marquee is with 3 floors.  But at least the Boombox room plays hip hop so we were all smiles!  Entrance to Marquee is on the 4th floor & the Boombox room was on the 5th.  Upon arrival I noticed how small it was.  Music was good though, drinks were okay & the outdoor patio was nice with some outdoor seating, which was a relief for my toesies!  Crowd seemed a little mix including a group of grandmas\/grandpas which before this trip out I would never see in the clubs, but hey it's Vegas!  

So maybe Thursday is the best night to go to avoid waiting in a fat line, but I hope to return next trip out and hopefully see all three floors though I'd probably migrate and stay in the Boombox room after exploring!",16,14,14

If you're coming here with a group of girlfriends, capable of buying your own drinks, and do not want to be groupies glomming onto the guys in an attempt to get them to drop more money than they had planned, this place isn't for you. 

This review is for the Marquee Day Club, on a Thursday, when they were not even remotely busy: 

At the Marquee day club, we reserved a cabana, so that we would have a server and be able to order food and drinks easily.. We were introduced to our server, and she took our first round of drink orders...and literally never saw her again after she brought our first order. We complained to management, he said he would send her over..she didn't come by.. we complained again, he asked us what we wanted and said he would put the order in himself.. 10 min later when we saw all of the servers goofing around and joking at the server station I decided to go to the bar and get our drinks ourselves. 

The whole staff was completely indifferent to us, and dropped us the second they swiped our credit card. At the end of the day when we were packing up--and had to ask two separate bussers to please send our server over so that we could cash out, she had the audacity to ask us for an additional tip outside of the 20% of what they had already factored in, or ""if you girls have some cash on you, you can slip that in too!"" Why are we going to tip someone when we experienced zero hospitality and extremely poor customer service? 

I am extremely, extremely disappointed. We even tried reaching out after the fact and did not receive a follow up, it took several emails, and phone calls to even talk to a manager, and he offered to by us a round if we went to the Marquee Nightclub that night. We opted to pass, and went to Tao in the Venetian where we were actually treated with respect and hospitality that we had expected to receive at the Cosmo.

The main room spin electronic and more top 40's hits and has a stage for visiting acts. It has ramps which allow for entry and several bouncers controlling the flow of traffic, which is great because it can get pretty crowded. Between the main floor and the patio area if a bar and a large space to hang out and give your feet a break from all the dancing but the main hang out space is the patio which has a great view of adjacent buildings and the decor is beautiful. 

The boom box room is located one floor up from the main room and spins mostly hip-hop and R n' B so you can change up the feel of your night.

Got presale tickets. The people working the presale ticket booth really need to standardize their process. It was an hour wait when it should've really just been 20 minutes. There were crowds of people trying to talk their way into buying tickets...and the ticket booth people listened!?

Stood in line with a lady who told me Kaskade was a hardcore traditional Mormon.

Anyways. Good music. Packed house. Hard to dance and navigate. Amazing caliber of DJ's they have lined up. The bar by the restroom is the least busy. Buy your drinks there. Lots of space in the pool, especially deeper in.

Mostly house\/electro with a hip hop room under, and lots of goddamn stairs just getting into the venue.

The club is massive! There are 2 separate rooms: hip hop and electronic music are in separate rooms. The hip hop room is a lot smaller while the electronic music venue is much bigger. All of the private booths circle around a large dance-floor while the DJ stand overlooks everyone.

They have this lemonade icee that they put a raspberry liquor into that is super delicious. Great for anyone who wants to just cool down and hate that alcohol taste.

The cabana's on the rooftop portion of the club is beautiful and overlooks the lovely Las Vegas strip.

Although the club was very large the place was extremely crowded on a Friday night.

The place was packed. The DJ was good. But unless you have a daybed or cabana, it's not as enjoyable. The minimum for a daybed was $1500. After the hefty that's closer to $2100. The reason you consider it is to have a place to put your stuff. That's a steep price to pay for a little space.

Last time I was there, one of the VIP promoters was rude to everyone in the table service line until our friend flashed his black Amex card. Then he not only let our group in, but followed my friend like a puppy and gave him his business card. What a joke.

There were only 4 guys who split the table and food minimum, but you can fit up to 18 people. What's nice about dayclubbing is you aren't restricted to purchasing bottles, so your money goes a long way. We ended up buying fishbowls, buckets of beer, and food. Since we were a long way from reaching our minimum, we gladly invited girls up to our cabana. It was a fun time.

So the Grand Cabana has a private infinity pool right in front of the cabana. There's a flat screen TV for you to tune to ESPN, an electronic safe to put your belongings, and a fully stocked fridge with water, juice, and energy drinks. We had cabana 14, which was dead center and had a great view of the DJ. Not to sound vain, but you get looks of jealousy from everyone else. Is it worth it? That's up to you.

It took a while for 8 girls to get ready in 2 bathrooms, so by the time we made it into the guest list line, they were just about ready to shut down the velvet ropes. Even then, lined up like sexy little lemmings (and huddled amongst a combination of ""barely 21's"" and seasoned club rats), it still took us one hour to reach the elevators that would take us to... the most crowded club any of us had ever been in.

Marquee is 3 floors of frat house... if that's your thing, then this place will rock-your-world. Being on the verge of 28, and having already lived (and happily passed through) that chapter in my life, I found the club to be WAY too crowded for my taste. But even with all of the bodies pressed against one another, I count my blessings in that (1) no one stepped on my toes that were quaintly peeking out of my awesome new wedge heels, and (2) no one knocked my overpriced cran-vodka out of my hand OR spilled their drinks on my way-too-cute body hugging teal dress.

Overall, a BEAUTIFUL club - aesthetically. Big, and just what you expect out of a Las Vegas hot spot. Amazing location, nestled in the very hip Cosmopolitan hotel. Variety in music, with three floors playing different genres of your favorite dance mixes... but for me, a solid 3 (-1 for size of crowd, and -1 for type of crowd).",7,7,4

Bartender right at the elevator was super sweet. She was so busy but never got flustered or angry with anyone ordering. A few of our group of 12 wandered off so the rest of us went to look for them and found them in the main room at a table, motioning for us to join them so we did.

I came here for my birthday to see Paul van Dyk, and it was epic. Legendary. Historic. The talent that is booked here on a regular basis is unparalleled. Just to give you a taste, here are some dj's that are scheduled in April: Sander van Doorn (4\/8); Erick Morillo (4\/9); Chuckie (4\/15); Kaskade (4\/16); Laidback Luke (4\/18); Markus Schulz (4\/23); Avicii (4\/29). If you love house music, Marquee is your Eden.

I've got one tip: COME EARLY (like 9pm early). Why? Because this club is so popular that there's a good chance you won't get in (even if you're a girl). Also because the moment you step inside, you're gonna need at least an hour to explore the club (the main floor, the lower floor, the upper floor, and the outdoor area). Marquee is a palace. There's no other way to put it.

The main floor probably won't knock your socks off. It's modestly sized, and the bathrooms are a bit out of the way. The dance floor isn't huge, so when there's a big name dj (like Paul van Dyk) spinning that night, the main floor will be flooded and security will seal off access to it (which they did). So be wary of when\/where you wander off to. Then you step outdoors, and the sheer size of it just takes your breath away. There are gigantic circular couches to sit or lie on. The outdoor bar is enormous. There are tons of heat lamps that will come in handy on chilly nights. Need to cool off? Have a drink? Cigarette? Wanna get to know the hottie you just met on the dance floor? Just step outside. Uh oh, is it too cold outside? But still don't feel like dancing? Go upstairs and chill in their lounge. There's another bar, pool tables, and a balcony (think Tao, but indoors). Mustered back some of your energy, but don't like house music? Go down to the bottom level where they play hip hop and top40.

If you're a frequenter of Las Vegas and you haven't been to Marquee, you're fucking up in life (yes Mimi L, I'm talking to you). I may never reach your status and celebrity on Yelp, but I've been to Marquee =)",10,4,5

We went to the main floor with the open dance space. It was fun but as the night progressed we were like sardines in a can. One of the promoters had said something about ""Madonna will be there"" to us earlier in the day and when we were there another girl we met was like ""I heard the same thing!"" Definitely no sign of Madonna so I'm assuming that was just a shady tactic to get people in, not a good way to conduct business in my book. Get people in based off word of mouth, not lying. When we were ready to leave around 1 am the bouncers escorted us (and I mean multiple clusters of people including me and my friend) to a back doorway whereafter we had to descend 5 flights of steps in a small concrete stairway that looked like a service section of the building. It took a good 7-8 minutes to get out of these little concrete back alleys\/stairs to finally get to the exit, it was ridiculous!

It was clear that large groups of guys didn't make it into the club guestlist or not, because it definitely wasn't a ""sausage fest"" inside. The bartenders were nice, drinks were strong, and my group somehow ended up receiving free drink tickets. Another neat aspect of this club is that it is 6000 square feet with 3 floors, featuring a downstairs hip hop room and upstairs library-themed floor. Theres also bars in every direction you look. Steve Angello was headlining the night I went and it was so incredible that I'm definitely going to try to make it to Kaskade or Above and Beyond in the next couple of months.

Lucky for the Cosmopolitan, they launched truly engaging advertising campaigns to lure visitors to experience ""Just the right amount of wrong.""

Glitz and glam in seductive city nightlife is how I would translate the Cosmopolitan and their most talked about attraction: Marquee.  

For my best friend's birthday, we came here to see Kaskade.  As expected, it was packed with die-hard house\/Kaskade fans.

For whatever evil reason, Marquee likes to make their guests walk up what seemed like 10 flights of stairs just to get inside.  The wait wasn't bad for the girls, but we were heaving from climbing up with our high heels. 

Like most Vegas clubs, there's a central location where the pool and main bars are located.  It was gorgeous.  We hung out here most of the night so that we can actually get a few breaths of fresh air.  My biggest annoyance was with this one incompetent bartender.  She was drunk, slow, dumb as a rock, and constantly asking her colleagues how to mix certain drinks.  Seriously?  It's Vegas on a busy Saturday night and you don't know how to make a simple drink?  It took 30 minutes to get a couple of shots.

Anyway - with a big group, it was inevitable that we would all get separated (especially with so many layers\/floors at Marquee).  The stuffy downstairs area had the hip\/hop room, and the main upstairs room was where the DJ was.

Let me tell you why Marquee is a money-hungry genius.  They set up this ""layered venue"" so that the girls would have to constantly run up and down stairs, get their feet swollen from their uncomfortable heels, and be forced to buy fugly, cheap $10 Old Navy flip flops in the bathroom.  The ones I bought were bright pink with polka dots.

The girls were given orange wrist bands that meant we could get free drinks up until 11:30p.m. That was awesome! Once we made our way inside the lady bartenders gave us our free drinks no problem. They were pretty fast at handling everyone's drink orders. There were 2 floors that we visited, the main one and the one just below it. Both got crowded real fast for the dance floors were quite small. So the reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was because of the music. Very disappointed in the choice of songs in the mix.

First, we were lookin' hot and my friend (who is from Vegas and has a Nevada ID) assured me that we could at least get discount for being ""locals."" Nope. 

$20 at the door for girls, $50 for guys. Thank goodness I do not have a penis. 

Next, the DJ was all right. That's probably what packs 'em in and makes the entrance expensive. I'm sure it was Kaskade or Avicii or one of those DJs that has the same dramatic musical lead-up followed by a bass drop repeated about 50 times throughout the evening. Good if you're drunk I suppose. The bartenders were okay too. 

Well drinks, $12. Or was it $14? Either way, I was outraged.

Also, I got lost twice trying to find the bathroom. It's kind of a confusing circle layout thing.

Now I know why people hate the strip. I am much more of a Fremont-Street-dive-bar type of gal. Next time I will definitely skip out.",7,6,3

Was one of the first people into the club and the decor was very nice. Three floors with the 2nd floor being the main one where the DJ is at. All three floors have a bar with the top floor having a pool table as well. I'm giving this place three stars because I wanted to dance lots more, but I couldn't because the main floor had reached capacity on the dance floor. They didn't let anyone through. It was super disappointing. Granted I was able to dance for a good hour and had left to check out the other floors, but I was peeved that 30 minutes later, I would no longer be able to dance there. It was a crazy place to be. Their security crew had to keep people moving and there was no place to sit or even lean against (because there were people lined up against the wall) unless you had bought a table.

We had gone to Hakkasan the night before and, while ended up having a good night, were not looking forward to being treated like scum by the bouncers for not paying for bottle service. Our fears were unfounded it seems, when we arrive we were greeted warmly by the security staff, barely had to wait in line and were taken up to the club promptly. Once inside the bar staff were efficient and everyone seemed hellbent on having a great time!

Not going to lie, ATB opening was pretty sick-nasty! However, he didn't come on until 2 a.m. and if you even want to get into the club without having to wait you gotta come at like 9-10 p.m. Another group of friends attempted coming in at 11 p.m. and they said they waited at the front of the line for 2 hours before they just gave up and left. AND it was a group of all girls.

The club itself is beautifully decorated. It's in the Cosmopolitan so you can't expect anything less. There are three floors to the club; the library, the club, and something else (we never got to it). Obviously, most of the people there stuck on the club floor. The dance floor is tiny... There is no way you won't find yourself humping a 360 degree radius in that club. And the fact that it's Vegas means everyone is a douche about it. Pushing, shoving, cursing, etc. The patio\/balcony area was very nice however. Great view of the Strip, functioning outdoor bar, lounging area, pool and heaters. The heaters are where everyone ended their nights.

The music was decent. The cruddy part was by the time ATB actually made it to the stage, half the club was already exhausted and some of my friends had left. He opened up with a bang, played some house music that kind of mellowed out the mood. And then picked it up again towards the end. It was a fun night, but I expected more from a Vegas club.",1,1,1

Unfortunately, I find it difficult to dance to house (though I don't mind listening), so I felt like all the space in the main room was wasted. The Boombox (hiphop room) on the other hand was CRAMPED as hell. It would be great if they could switch the music between the two rooms... I think it would be a more efficient usage of space.

The outdoor patio looked nice, but unlike XS, you need a table in order to access the hot tub area. Also it was super cold and windy when we went (Jan) so we didn't really enjoy sitting outdoors. I'm sure its much nicer in late spring\/summer.

We decided to grace Marquee with our presence (HAH!) on Saturday... and it was oddly dead. HUH?! Where are all the party people at?

If you do, this is thee place for you! Lol There are three floors and you go up and down a ton of stairs to get around. Usually you can find some space to dance, but it was pretty tight. Outside patio area was nice, but hot as hell. It didn't feel that hot if you were outside walking around on the strip. Just no air circulation or something. There was a loooong line at about 10pm when we got up to the club. Super happy our large group got pulled up to the front and no cover. Score!

The bouncers were pretty rude as some others have mentioned. The dance floor ""closed"" about 30-1 hour before the club. That sucked. Two of my friends made it down, but all of a sudden the bouncers arms started pushing people back. You don't have to sound like a dick to get your point across.

Women's bathroom had a decent lounge area with mirrors to primp. Didn't have to wait in any line to peeeee! (Girls you understand what I mean).

Pretty nice club, although I think the best part about Marquee is the outside patio. Lots of space to move around, and multiple bars make buying drinks a breeze. I never waited more than 5 minutes to order, and the bartenders were pretty friendly overall. I forgot how much drinks were, but beers were $9\/each.

As for the security, I believe they're pretty strict. I didn't get kicked out, but a bunch of my female friends got kicked out for stupid shit like touching the jacuzzi water, or stumbling. Cmon man... we in a club.. in vegas! Whatever, I had fun.

Side note, the staff at the cosmopolitan were very helpful. As I was holding up the hair of two females yacking outside the club, I was offered assistance on two different occasions in the form of a portable trash bag and a personal (and cordial) escort for me and my friends to the taxi line.

The main room hosts a huge dance floor and usually fabulous live DJs and music from artists like Deadmau5, Kaskade (I was there this weekend for his release party for Fire and Ice), LMFAO (gotta love my party rock Mondays for locals)

If you choose to go downstairs right from the entrance there's a smaller club that boasts Hip-hop music.  As you enter you'll see a big neon sign that asks ""Down wit O.P.P."" yeah you know me!!

If you choose to go upstairs, where the library is at, exists a more lounge chill scene, with a pool table places to cozy up and sit beside the fireplace and books.  The music up there is more classic R&B, which I dig.

Outside where the day club is in the summer is open too as a mass dance floor with heating lamps to keep us warm in the winter and sometimes a separate DJ and music popping off too!  My friends got a cabana and table service outside before, I was impressed, very top of the line with the LCD TVs available, mini fridge and just overall service of the staff.

Marquee has some of the NICEST bouncers and bartenders I've ever met.  For such an upscale place, their staff is very friendly and not dick-ish at all like you would assume to encounter.

Nevertheless, I really enjoy going here on Mondays just to weed out most of the touristy crowds.

For starters let me say this: if you are planning on going to the uber-hotspot Marquee on a good night (in my case, it was a Friday), you must plan, plan, plan your night out. 

Was in a party of 5 (2 girls, 3 guys), but had a hookup from Brandon Grady. Bless, you sir. Got there at 10pm on the dot and glad it wasn't a moment later. Beware that there are several different entrances to this club. There's a line if you're an all-girl party. There's a line if you bought internet pre-sale tickets. There's a line if you're on a guest list. There's a line if you're ordering bottle service. There's a re-entry line. Blah, blah, blah. Like I said, plan it out so that you're not wasting time.

We got in the guest list line and made it to the cashier\/elevator line section within 5 minutes. I don't feel like I should have to mention that there is a dress code here and guys should not wear sneakers or they will get rejected, but...I saw this happen to at least 3 guys, so I'm mentioning it.

Cover was $30\/guys, $20\/girls with discounts if you're a local. Once we exited the elevator, there must have already been at least 600-700 people inside the club. This was at 10:05 pm. Have I mentioned you should have a plan when coming here?

Love the outdoor pool area. Love the music, although I will say that the dance floor got extremely claustrophic. I wish it was a bigger area. Love the hundreds upon hundreds of scantily-clad beautiful people. Let me say that again: I really enjoyed looking at the hundreds of scantily-clad beautiful people. Drinks are your standard Vegas prices.

Of course you can order bottle service or a cabana, but with so many people in the club, I don't see the point of paying $1,200 for a table when you'll have people bumping into you and stepping on your feet while you sit there. The cabanas look like they afford a modicum of privacy\/exclusivity.

Have to give a shout-out to the two girls who put on mermaid fins and got in the pool around 11pm. Mermaids are awesome.

Love this hotel. Love this club. LA has absolutely nothing like it. It's like a club on steroids! Highly recommend.

          If I love Marquee in Manhattan, I expect no less than the same management group to run Marquee Las Vegas. Always a good time here, despite the crazy crowd of freaking EDC sweaty crowd. We always have a great time here.

Just a few quick tips: 

- Don't even try to come here without table service, unless you are a hot girl. When I say hot girls I mean it. 

- Be classy, don't be a typical Vegas chic, chances are you will get it (without the table service)

- 3 levels so check out the music that you actually enjoy when you book your table via your host.

- 1 of the hottest clubs in Vegas

       Marquee is type of club if you get in, you enjoy it, and those that don't or can't afford the table service will bitch and moan about it. Remember this is a 5 diamonds hotel resort, so if you can't afford it, you should go else where to have a good time. Just don't ruin it for others. Nuff said!",11,10,7

Those stairs are killer. I must start off by saying... LADIES, BE PREPARED. Drunken people with multiple flights of stairs, and girls in heels? Such a horrible, dangerous mix.  

We knew a promoter so we didn't take the main entrance to get in... we went up to the 3rd floor and got in right away.  You're given stamps on the inside of your wrist and on the top of your hand.  Very structured and very swift at getting people in.  Onto the club.

The Boombox Level was the hip-hop floor, and the one I parked myself in.  The dance floor is tiny - and it filled up extremely quickly.  The bar right by the dance floor works fast and they're friendly.  Just be prepared to pay outrageous prices for drinks (always).  They have a door that leads you to the outside patio area, where the bathrooms are located.  

Bad news?  Even if you're waiting for someone in the bathroom, they won't let you sit down. ANYWHERE. The only place you can sit is bottle service.  Or on the toilet.  Speaking of which... the bathroom is tiny. Way too small.  But the line went fast and the girls in there were respectful.  Sometimes a mix of alcohol and a room full of ladies can bring out the worst in someone.  No problems here.  

The major floor at this club was the house\/techno floor, which I'm not exactly a fan of... but we decided to check it out.  They had a dance floor, lots of walking space, and an outdoor area as well.  Plenty of bars on this level, so there weren't ridiculously long lines.  

The top floor of this club? Don't bother.  It's weird.  There's fireplaces and pool tables?  Why would you go to a club to play pool? I don't know, I thought this level was a bit random.  Anyway.  After checking out each level, I was in love with the music on the first one.  So we faced the stairs, made our way back down, and danced the night away.  Girls are invited to dance on top of the tables (right next to the DJ) for a few minutes, then are helped back down.  One of my friends got to do it.  Lots of pretty people here. 

I will probably be back here, if I make my way to Vegas anytime soon.",1,1,1

I feel like a lot of my reviews start with ""unce unce unce"" hahaha. Can't get enough of that edm! Anywayyys, I had me & my bf on the GL so we were both able to get in for FREE..... to see DASH BERLIN !!!!!! :D AMAZING! We had to get in before 11pm to make the cut off time. So we started lining up around 10:30 and they gave us our ticket right away. I was also able to get a wristband for open bar ... but it ended at 11pm :( and I didn't make it on time. Oh wells! Drinks are pretty pricey, but I guess it's average in vegas? I got a redbull vodka, which was $18 + $2 tip = $20 total for that damn drink! Plus, it wasn't even that strong :( Bleh. Buuuuttt, I did talk to some guy & he gave me a ticket for a free drink but it only limits to 1 to 1 ratio of juice and alcohol. But still good, FREE drink!!! :)

The dance floor is kinda small but it's better than hakkasan. I love that Marquee had the outdoor & indoor stage and a pool outside! When I went on Monday, it was SUPER windy ... so hopefully people going to EDC the weekend after will be okay and EDC won't be cancelled like it did 2 years ago haha. There was also a sitting area outside as well, right next to the bar, pretty sweet! My bf's knees were hurting really bad so thankfully they had a place to sit and not having us get tables.

Our table was 3 grand to normal people that is a decent amount of money. Well we went to the club at about 1130pm and we were waiting in line for our table that we already paid for. Meanwhile multiple people were cutting ahead of us in line so my friend decided to go up to the bouncer and tell him we actually had a table bought and reserved ahead of time. Well the bouncer was immediately rude and said that she had a attitude and was not allowed into the club even though she was just asking him what was going on she did not have an attitude at all. When we finally had the hostess wait on us he told us that they gave our table away because we got there late which did not make sense at all considering the fact we already bought the table and online it didn't say we needed to be there by a certain time. About 15mins later the hostess comes back and tells us that he found a table for us they walk us back to a table that was filthy it had empty beer bottles on it and it was for 5 people we had ten people in our group all of us couldn't even fit in the area since it was so tiny . When the hostess walked us back the bouncer that we dealt with earlier told the hostess that we had attitude problems so I feel like they were purposely making us have a rough time from the start. So since we were at an extremely tiny table we asked if there  was any bigger ones since that is what we reserved in the first place. The hostess just sat there and was texting on his phone then finally he  aknowleged us and told us he could take us to another table he then brought us to a two person table and actually said to us this is what you get for complaining I could not believe we were getting treated like this so we told him we spent what we thought was a lot of money to be there and he said to us who cares about 3 grand people spent 10 grand on a table tonight. For a club that people supposedly spend a ton of money at and a lot of A listers go to it was overwhelming packed we could barely walk out of the club they were cramming people in there like sardines. If it's supposed to be such a nice club they wouldn't need to pack a bunch of people in there. After they brought us to a two person table we decided to just leave it wasn't worth it to get treated like that after we spent a decent amount of money to be there. It was my friends big night to go out and have fun and due to getting treated so poorly her night was 
ruined because of some bouncers that were never anyone on a extreme power trip.  We were only in Vegas for a weekend and had everything planned and the thing she was looking forward to the whole weekend was seeing French Montana and it is really awful how it turned out but I could sit here and type until my fingers fell off about how awful this establishment is but it's not going to matter I'm sure someone bought our table before we even got out of the club. Places like this and the people who run them treat the customers however they want because they know they will always have business no matter what and like the bouncer told us what's 3 grand anyways?

Absolutely the best nightclub and venue in Las Vegas. HANDS-DOWN.

Thankfully, we did not have to wait in line (heard it was a 3 hour wait) and so our overall experience was much more pleasant than other reviewers.

The interior of the club was JIZZ-WORTHY. There was so many rooms with great music. The Boombox had a more hip-hop underground feel. The Library Room was my favorite; complete with pool tables and a balcony overlooking the DJ booth and dancing peeps.

Pool and cabanas with clear-glass hot tubs. HOLY SH*T AWESOME. Beautiful views of the City Center, heated lamps, and mini bars sprawled everywhere.

YES, my kind of place.

Decor, lighting, drinks, VIP tables; everything were all 5 star factors.

ATB performed the night we visited and the crowd was insane. Loved the vibe here.

This just kind of happened but I am glad this is number 100.  Marquee is my favorite club in Vegas at the moment.  The three levels with the three different scenes are awesome and accommodate most tastes (Hip Hop, Trance, and Lounge scenes).  And just to respond to all the comments about the stairs, they are not that bad.  If you want a short cut between the Hip Hop Level (5) and the Main Floor (6), go out the doors to the pool area\/patio on the Main Floor, turn left and you will see a wide staircase down a nice relaxing\/chill\/cool down area plus easy access to the Hip Hop Level (5).

On to the review!  I have been to Marquee 6 times this year and have always had fun (like I said, I am a Vegas addict).  The music is always good, especially with the rotating guest DJ's (KASKADE performance = EPIC).  If you are in the mood for hip hop, the Boom Box Room\/Hip Hop Level (5) always has a great mix that is awesome and fun to dance to.  If you want a break from all the craziness, walk up the stair to the Library and relax, get a breather and lounge.  As a bonus, the people here are good looking and friendly.

As a bonus, the promoters and guest list folks are pretty helpful in taking care of you for guest lists or tables.  Take advantage of this!

Can't wait for my next trip to Vegas because Marquee will definitely be on the itinerary.  Also, if you get a chance to go to Marquee, try to make it a Kaskade weekend, you will not be disappointed.",2,0,3

I love that there are different floors for different types of music. For the particular night that we went, we stayed on the house floor because Avicii was DJ-ing that night. It was CROWDED. Crowded where I thought I was going to die. Security guards blocked off the dancefloor and did not let anyone else go inside. Walking around the dancefloor was hell because people would block traffic. For a claustrophobic person, this was a nightmare.

But I am giving this place 4 stars because its beautiful here. Honestly, when we walked to the hip hop floor, it was a lot more spacious. So that just tells me that it's either cause house music is trending, or its because Avicii was there. If you don't mind hip hop music (its good music, like Trey Songzz!!!), then go to the hip hop floor instead!!! 

I've heard horror stories about climbing the stairs up to the club, which us girls didn't have to go. But if I had to in heels, I would be unhappy. Definitely will be back when it isn't so packed cause it was New Years weekend!",3,2,2

Our table was in the hiphop room, and now and then we wandered upstairs to the techno room.  I danced the night away.  And when I say dance I mean, get low, dance on the couches in my stilettos, kind of dancing.  Can you picture me doing this?  Me either.  But I did.  And it felt good (till the next day when my thighs were so sore I could barely walk down stairs (*shakes fist at old age*).  I drank the night away.  And when I say drank, I mean I had to buy my own $18 glasses of Jameson (and not full glasses either, more like barely a shot in the glass) because I didn't like the bottles of vodka & gin we had.  Yes, I said $18\glass, for Jameson, your eyes are not deceiving you (*shrugs shoulders*).  I laughed the night away.  And by laugh I mean just that, laughing till my stomach hurt - it was the most fun I've had in a really long time.

I had Joe as my designated bodyguard, checking up on me frequently throughout the night to make sure no dudes got inappropriate with me - also to make sure I was doing ok as I started getting that ""drunk girl wobbly in high heels"" look about me.  I heart Joe.  We had Tiara serving our table pouring the drinks whenever someones cup got low.  She is a complete sweetheart and so friendly you would think you've been friends with her for years.

I'll always be more of a little-secluded-low-key-bar type of gal, but once in awhile a girl has to dance the stress away.  Clubs in Vegas still frustrate the hell outta me, especially the line organization, but since we usually get a table I don't have to deal with any of that which makes the process a whole lot easier to bear.  I suggest you go this route, though it ain't cheap.  The staff working with us inside were incredibly professional and very friendly - not just friendly for a sec then toss us aside like yesterdays news - I mean friendly throughout the whole night checking up on us to make sure we were doing ok or asking us if we needed anything (Joe & tiara, you guys are THE best).  I appreciate staff who don't suffer from a superiority complex.  2 stars for joe & tiara and 2 stars for the club itself.  It's a nice spacious place with good music.  I wouldn't mind dancing on their couches again.",4,3,4

In the outdoor pool area it's great to look up and see all the lighted hotel towers above you while partying on a rooftop.
  Anyway there are plenty of bars placed around the upstairs floor to the point we didn't have to really wait for a drink.  The price is the norm for Vegas night clubs ($15 for goose and tonic), and the staff is friendly.

It's a little hard to find, but it was great - a basement party playing old school early 90s hip-hop all night (or at least as long as I was there.)

So if you don't like this music, there's a second floor that plays hip hop!

Watch out during huge events because the dance floor can get crowded, you can't even dance, and it starts smelling like sweat!!!! That's the only downfall so get there early and stay there!

The group I was with was too large that we all stayed outside where it was nice and cool and we created our own little circle and danced the night away.

The DJs who stepped up to the booth were phenomenal, and the crowd was pulsing to the music.

Like most of the big clubs in Vegas, this is not your walk-up kind of club unless you feel like waiting. Get on a guestlist or your experience will easily be two stars because of the wait. We got in pretty quickly, and it was incredibly crowded. Stay away from the walkways unless you know exactly where you are going and don't mind getting hustled along by security. The Library Room upstairs provides somewhat of a refuge from the madness, but...it's upstairs. Call me an amateur, but I can't do that more than a couple times in ridiculous heels.

One thing I did appreciate, oddly enough - that the music was loud enough to feel enveloped in, but wasn't so loud that you could feel your eardrums vibrate with every beat. My hearing was relatively intact the next day, despite the rest of my body punishing me for dancing so much.

The bouncers can be a pretty pushy, so when there's a staff member that stands out among the crowd it really makes a difference. Brian T who promotes for Marquee has to be one of the best promoters in Vegas, which makes me even more likely to come to Marquee when I'm deciding which club to go to on a given night. A lot of people feel like they need to be some A-list celebrity to get into Marquee, but when you know a guy like Brian, he treats his people like royalty, and never gives any kind of attitude like some promoters do. Look up Brian T. At Marquee on Facebook, and he'll make sure you and your friends get in and have a great time. 

I'm a huge fan of the day parties. Way more of a party atmophere vs. getting dressed up and being pretentious. If you've had a bad experience on a Friday or Saturday night, come to the Sunday day party and see if it changes your opinion. Just make sure you hit up Brian first.",4,1,1

First, let me say that I love Marquee and have never had a problem here but on this particular day, I think the bartender was really going through some things. She got upset because we told her we did not like the taste of our drinks compared to the drinks that another bartender made for us earlier at the same bar. She started to cry (NOT KIDDING) and when a fellow bartender saw her crying, she looked over at us and said, ""Don't worry, we'll just get them kicked out."" At this time, A MALE bartender stepped in to remake the drinks. While we were waiting for the new batch, security started to surround us. I literally thought I was being pranked because it was so unbelievable to me that this was happening because we asked a bartender to remake our drinks, which is essentially her job!!!!!

Long story short, security didn't ask us any questions or gather any information from us regarding what transpired. They just kicked us out. They refused to return my drivers license (they asked for it when they approached us) an one of the female security guards tried to forcefully remove my wristband when not one person asked me to remove it. Her supervisor had to tell her not to touch me. I eventually had to get the Cosmo front desk employees involved just to mediate the situation and retrieve my drivers license. Cosmo told me that the day club operates independently of the hotel and they would not be able to help. I refused to accept that answer and eventually head of security for the hotel got involved and was able to retrieve my DL from security at Marquee Day Club with no problem.

I know that Vegas just assumes that everyone is drunk and must be guilty of whatever is being alleged by their staff, but I think the way Marquee handled this situation was extremely unprofessional, and more consideration should have been given to us since we were paying customers.",2,2,1

Regardless, Marquee is still an absolute dream...probably an exact replica of what I had always thought a Vegas club would be.

The screen in the main room will have you so mesmorized that you won't even notice the people around you until you inevitably have spilled drank all up in your heels. True story. Once you feel like you're about to have a seizure from the strobing lights, take a trip to the Boombox room, where you can get your thug life on, as I did.

Firstly, ""special"" access to the club is only by way of an ugly stairwell with 6 large flights of stairs.  This is difficult to manage in heels and when you finally arrive at the top your feet already hurt.  

Secondly, They reward your hike up the stairs by ONLY having ""Reserved"" seating for bottle service (Min $1000 and up) and vip's which you will get kicked out of if you try to sit and rest.  ALL seating was ""Reserved"" although the majority of the booths were empty.  It was confusing since they were projecting the logo of the corp event that hosted the party but none of the booths or amenities of the club were available for the corporate guests.

I love to dance but I do need to sit and rest and enjoy the music with a drink too.  I didn't even want to dance at the Marquee since I knew there would be no place to recharge when my feet were hurting (which were already in pain from the stairs) We then asked someone by the pool if there was anywhere to sit.  They told us that the booths in the back area of the pool area are the last to be seated and so we are least likely to be kicked out of those.  It was the area outside, no a\/c and furthest from the dance floor.  We found a place and were booted about 10 minutes later.

Thirdly, when it was time to leave we went to the elevator and were told we could not use it but instead had to walk down the 6 large flights of stairs again.  We begged them to let us use the elevator but they would not budge.  Everyone leaving was upset and complaining about the ridiculous stairs and absence of seating.  The stairs were extremely dangerous in heels, especially for those that had drank a bit.  One girl we passed was practically being carried down  by her man.  One slip down these treacherous stairs and the Cosmopolitan is going to have a lawsuit on their hands.  

We left angry and vowing never to return to the Marquee.  I am also notifying my Corporate Network connections to avoid this venue for future events.

The pool was crazy. Girls are dancing all over the place. There are even miniature mobile islands in the middle of the pool where girls can go and dance. When the party got going and everyone was considerably drunk, there was just pure mayhem, splashing, and dancing going on. 

Poolside bottle service, gambling tables in the back, and several bars around the day club makes this place very accommodating and amazing if you are looking to have fun and spend money along the way.

This was my first really big trip to vegas, and I came ready to spend anything to have a great time. I'm a male.

I was with was a smoking babe and we were dressed in pretty high end clothes, so we talked to the bouncers and were polite and they let us in a faster guest line. There were 15 people in the line, so we evaded the 500 person regular line. Cool. Groups of annoying girls who looked 18 got let in without any line, not sure who they knew.

In 30 minutes, we were in. The tickets all say ""VIP"" on them, and that is kind of offensive because all I did was get into a club, why on earth does that make me very important? The place was so crowded that we couldn't go anywhere. Drunk people were stumbling everywhere, felt like we were in a college bar. The dance floor was so packed that none of the people were moving. The music was repetitive. The songs went on forever and sounded exactly the same; there were no words, which is likely 50% of the reason no one was dancing. We saw zero very attractive people. By the end of the night we were dying to hear just ONE LMFAO song; we followed a herd of drunks out of the ugly, sticky stairwell and couldn't get the beats out of our heads till the next morning. Money wasn't a big deal, but we wasted a lot of time here! I think coming here not on a saturday or friday would be better.

But, it still gets 3 stars because the Marquee Dayclub was amazing. We got here at 11AM and got in for free (again, we were polite and dressed very nicely).

Not sure what was going on, but there was hardly any line, so we were able to get in within 10 minutes - 5 of which was actually spent waiting for the elevator to the club. 

Since it was so early, the place was maybe half-full - fine for us, since it gave us room to wander about freely and explore. The interior was sleek - just like the rest of the hotel's decor. Never did make it up to the library or down to the boombox room, but the open outdoor space was plenty sufficient (with amazing views) on this balmy start-of-summer night. 

The rest of the night was a blur of dancing, Tokyo Teas and table service, so I'm not too helpful here. I do remember the table hostesses were speedy in pouring drinks for us as soon as anyone picked up a bottle (probably to use up the alcohol faster), but overall cordial & attentive service. 

Around 2AM, I'm walking around, looking for my group (very easy to get separated here), when I see one of my friends (who had a bittt too much to drink) getting wheelchaired by security to a secluded hallway. I run (possibly hobble) after them, saying ""Hey! That's my friend!"" and they lead us into a separate room to get basic info from her, before calling another security guy to escort us out to the casino through a back service elevator. I thought they would be total jerks about it, but they were really nice about the whole situation, with a ""Don't worry, it happens"" attitude. 

Overall, had a great time despite mostly only hanging out in the outdoor area. Will definitely come back, if only to explore the rest of the floors and indoor space. Four stars for the service & crowd, five stars for the surprisingly pleasant security folks.",2,2,2

The pitchers of flavored mojitos were ok, but it wasn't  all that. I've tasted better! They sure took forever to come out. We finished a few pitchers and were waiting on some more, and we were kind of getting impatient. I guess we wanted to get drunk, but of course, we weren't.

I had heard sooo much about Marque and how amazing it was that I had to check it out for myself. My friends and I didn't want to take any chances and got there before 11 on a promoter's list. Be sure to get in touch with some sort of promoter or list if possible because the general admission line is pretty ridiculous. When we first arrived it wasn't too bad. I thought the decor was pretty simple though. Its super dark in there though so I would suggest to take it easy on the alcohol. The DJ was pretty great. We were on the hip hop floor and had a great time for the first hour. After that it got soooo packed. Like ridiculously crowded to where it wasn't even possible to dance anymore.  If it wasn't for the amount of people squished in the hip hop room I'm sure my experience would have been better. Perhaps I'll give it another shot on a slower night.,1,0,0

Aside from the cool interior, this place still maintains the regular assholeness of any other club in Vegas. In actuality, that feeling is elevated because the place is so ""in"" right now. 

The staff (doormen, promoters, everyone) pulled a rope-a-dope on us when we went so this adds to my distaste. Got in touch with different promoters who promised us different prices for ""getting on the list"" which I should add is absolutely useless btw. Some promised us $100 at the door, some $65, some $45. When we got in, the doormen cut the amount of people in my group by half on a whim and told us if we didn't like it then GTFO. But we were already in line, and everyone had been assembled - THEY KNOW that WE KNOW that we couldn't go anywhere else. 

...it's a seller's market bitches...

Any way we got to the door and ended up paying $80 just because they said so. The highest cover ever for a club - pretty sure I got scammed. Assembled a higher girl-guy ratio for nothing. It didn't matter.

The interior was nice but as everyone says, they cram way too many people in here. It was super-packed on the dance floor. Couldn't move. The pool area was aight. Met some douchey groups though. The billiard room was small and kinda pointless in my opinion. 

All in all, I wouldn't come back unless it were free. It's the typical ""screw you out of your wallet"" mentality here, and they have every right to do it because you're a guy and they're the hottest club in town.",2,3,1

My friends and I totted back & forth between the House room (left because all the confetti kept getting into our drinks) and the smaller Hip-Hop room. While the adjective glamorous describes the house room, the adjective raw definitely describes the hip-hop room. Quite a bit smaller, the crowd is more diverse and the hip-hop a good mixture of old school and the new heavy hits.  My fave part of Marquee\/the hip-hop room was the outdoor balcony.

We were told by one of the promoters (""promoters"" don't actually really mean anything) that our table would get in the girls for free and the guys would pay $100 each (we were a group of three girls and two guys with the rest of our group already inside at the table). We waiting in line for over an hour, every 20 minutes or so the promoter changed the price. Me and another girl had already decided to split whatever price the guys would have to pay so that wasn't so much an issue. Finally after waiting forever we go into the elevator... Only to wait in another line for an hour. 

After we finally get into the club, it's so packed you literally can't walk. It's just people scooting and shoving around each other while the bouncers yell at you to walk. ""You can't stand here!"" Well there's no room to walk, literally like cattle being shoved, shoulder to shoulder. I started to get faint from claustrophobia. We had to squeeze our way onto the dance floor and to our table which took 40 minutes. Then when we finally got to our table, the bouncer wouldn't let us into it. We told him we paid and it was OUR table, but he just kept shaking his head. Pretty sure he wanted a tip. We said fuck that and went outside to get some air, which took another 30 minutes to do. Music was lame everyone was wasted and there was literally no room to move so we just left. Needless to say I'll never waste my time or money going to ANY of the new Vegas clubs. Seems like a fire hazard to have twice as many people in a room as you can fit. If you love that Vegas scene, Guys grabbing you every few minutes even WHILE you're  embraced with your boyfriend, no room to move, shitty staff, overpriced everything, waiting in line for hours for the ELEVATOR to wait in another line, and basic edm that's all the same no matter what Dj is playing, and no guarantee of getting what you paid for even if you paid hundreds of dollars for a table, then by all means have a blast in your 2x2 square. If you like having more down to earth, reasonably priced, less shallow fun, well Vegas is a bad place to start, but I suggest getting the hell out of any edm club on the strip and checking out casinos or downtown Las Vegas. Much more relaxed and you can actually breath air.",2,1,1

We knew it would be crazy packed so our promoter told us to be in line by 8-8:30. However, my friends were staying at the Cosmopolitan and the front desk and concierge had both told them that if they go to the line by 10, one room key can get 2 people in. I knew something was wrong and just wished I could have gotten there at 8, but I trusted my friends. We get in line at 10 only to finally get in at 1 a.m. after being in the front of the line for 3 hours. We finally get to the desk and the girl says everyone has to pay even though we have room keys.  Apparently, only 1 person PER ROOM can get in for free. Of course my friend complains and the girl ""GRACIOUSLY"" offers to comp the girls because girls are NEVER comped at the clubs. Right, ladies? Whatever! Don't talk to me like I've never been at a club before. She made the 3 guys pay $40 each. Okay, pretty standard for a new club. My friend finally gives in because we're holding up a line and the girl charges her card $240! Then says oops, doesn't process the refund, and promises my friend that the concierge will refund her the $120 and maybe the other $120. Of course, my friend asks for this in writing and the girl gets super annoyed. WHAT A BITCH. She's the one who made a mistake and overcharged. In the end, the concierge refunded her $120 and gave her hotel credit for $120. I know the club and the hotel are separate entities, but come on! GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT and don't tell your hotel guests the wrong information.

I knew I should have just gotten there early for the guestlist. Oh well. Standard Vegas mistake.

We finally get inside and it's packed full and you can barely move around. We're not huge trance fans, so we go to the hip hop room which would have been cool... if they played hip hop. I kind of wished I stayed downstairs to watch the dumb Asian boys play with their glowsticks. Yes, ladies, glowsticks.

Warning to anyone attempting to come here with anything but a pack of girls: be prepared for at least a two hour wait, even if you get there at 9:00, and even if you're on the guest list. Also, you won't be able to get it without bottle service (~$1500 for 3 bottles the worst tables outside) if you don't have an even ratio of guys to girls. The line outside had to be breaking some sort of fire code with the massive hoard of hot, sweaty, cramped people gathered on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan. I can't stress how un-awesome that was.

Once we finally were escorted inside, I was shocked that instead of putting us in the elevator to get to the club, they led a group of ~20 people to the STAIRWELL and had us climb 4 flights of stairs. W.T.F. They said it was to get people in the club faster - bull $h!t. I waited two hours in 4"" heels - you better carry my @$$ up these stairs!

Once we finally got into the club, it was indeed amazing. The design has a very spacious industrial feel to it. There is lots of space, occupied by tons of people. The stairwell put us into the smaller Boombox Room, with DJ Lisa Pittman spinning with DJ Eric DLux (from Power 106 in LA... whoop whoop!) We checked it out for a bit and found fresh air outside that room.

We went upstairs to the main dancefloor that lead to the outside area where we could smoke our cigar. That whole floor is huge, and really fun. Outside by the pool has got to be my favorite area (beside the Boombox Room), because of the fresh air, awesome views of Aria & City Center, the nice decor, & good music.

Overall, the club needs some work... I'll be happy to come back when they get their $h!t straight. Until the wait and the elevator situation are remedied, I'd much rather party at the other awesome clubs in Vegas that have it down. It was nice to check it out though!",7,6,6

Me: ""WTF?! I'm only wearing a bra! I will be out of costume""
Security guard: ""No no no, if thats not her costume, dont make her do that man""

Manager walks up to me
Manager: ""Lady deathstrike""
Me: ""Ooo shit you recognized me!""
Manager: ""I bet youre looking for this guy"" and proceeds to show me a picture of a dude who was dressed as wolverine the night before LOL
Me: ""Yes! i've been trying to find a wolverine to fight!""
Manager: ""Why are you guys standing here?""
Friend: ""I cant get in because im wearing a sleeveless shirt""
Manager: ""Let me see what i can do""

a few minutes later, a security guard walks up and opens the ropes for us and while my friends walk through, I get stopped

Security Guard #23494823: ""i cant let you in with those""
Me: ""These nails?! everyone else let me in,  its part of my costume! its only duct tape!""
Security Guard #82404927: ""But you might poke someones eye out""

Opposed to Wet Republic and Liquid lounge at the Aria, the music here was all electronic that the crowd did not seem to know. Liquid had a top 40 hip hop mix that was WONDERFUL. Wet Republic had Aoki so everyone loved that. Marquee seemed like it was a dreary movie with people who were 'trying' to learn how to have fun. It's more a place for women to have sexy bikinis and dress up and not dance. Dudes just are jacked, tan, standing and looking lost.

First off, I know this is like club industry and all, but c'mon Marquee this is still a business establishment ... have some standards. So I called to inquire about cabana\/daybed prices but wanted to confirm with my BF so told them I'd call back to reserve. Well good thing, because when I called back later in that day it was hundreds of dollars cheaper than what the first girl told me. It's like a difference of a bottle! Ummm that's SHADY! 

When we arrived, it wasn't much hassle getting in. We were seated in a daybed area not exactly to my liking and I asked to be moved to a nearby empty one but before I could even try to tip her she said no. Apparently I have to specify that in my reservation? Ummm how the heck am I supposed to know what to ask for? This is not ticketmaster choose your own seating. 

Anyway, we were all having a good time. Liquor was flowing, yummy food kept coming, the pool was still fun and refreshing, and there was a good crowd. But it seemed short lived, because we got tired of it fairly quickly. It must've been a combination of packed, obnoxious, drunk people that finally got in, the hot sun beating on us, and hour after hour of just electronic\/house\/trance music. I know that's what's popular nowadays, but sh*t DJ, change it up a little! Cliche maybe, but what's wrong with throwing in the Cali hip hop set or even a little top 40?? It's like they know they're at the ""hottest"" spot already so they don't feel the need to put down their drink and actually spin. 

We were just burnt out and wanted to go back up to our room so I told the waitress we we ready to close out. She said she thinks I still have some money to meet the minimum so I told her we'll just order stuff to go. She came back telling me an exact dollar amount so I ordered accordingly. She came back with our food and the final tab, and goes oh btw, you were actually over, hope that's okay?? Excuse me?! You were the one that told me how much more I needed to spend only to find out I didn't need to at all?!?! It was by hundreds of dollars!! How do you get that wrong when you're ringing it all up on the register? And umm if you know that you fkd up wouldn't you run it by me first before you charge my card?? Shhaaaady!!!  At that point I was livid, but didn't want to cause a scene and stay any longer. I made a snide comment and grudgingly signed my tab.

I must admit I went on a Monday and I had the best time with my boyfriend. We got two lounge chairs and just sunbaked and had a really great waitress, her name I forget, but she was so sweet and attentive and accidentally gave me a double shot of belvedere on the rocks, which in American terms is a full glass of vodka straight i.e. about 8 Australian shots of Vodka.

You can find plenty of stories in other reviews although interestingly most of the 5 star reviews here are by the staff\/promoters of the club. I don't expect a promoter to promote by writing bad reviews of the club. 
Despite being multi floor and covering a lot of area the club's main dance floor has only space for about 50 people at a time and security guys won't let you stand anywhere but that doesn't stop the management to keep letting people in. 
Another advise, don't let the security get away by forcefully searching you without your consent or take you any back room. You can claim wrongful imprisonment, wrongful search without warrant\/authority and you can bring a civil case against them.",7,4,4

I absolutly loved this club.! I go to Vegas every Halloween, it's turning into a tradition for me , big time. Halloween has always been my favorite holiday, being I am an October baby. Dress up, party with friends, haunted houses, etc I am a junkie for all of this.
So it would only be appropriate to venture off to Vegas yet again for Halloween weekend. A week before the trip I bought a pre sale ticket for Kaskade @ Marquee Halloween night. And thank godness for this . I was on it Halloweent night, I did NOT want to have to wait in any atrocious lines. 
I actually went to will-call hours before the event, got my hard copy of my tick and I knew I would be G2G by the time I returned to party party.
And it sure paid off. I arrived with my friend and her bf around 10 pm. I strategically did not want to get there any later.
The set up is confusing. There are 3 or 4 different ways to get in .They sent me to the floor for presale. I literaly waited 5 minutes if that and I was in. Lost my friend instantly.This place is HUGE ..
Its gorgeous inside of there and the audio system KNOCKS hard . 
After being there an hour or so, my bf decides he wants to roll through ... he calls me when he arrives telling me the line was off the hook long like in the thousands damn near....
So I wont get into detail or blow our cover but I found a secret entry way up in this place. I was on a mission to get my bf in and I succeeded. Told him to meet me at this secret  location , he found me, we descended up some cutty stairs, him doubting ,me the whole time and BOOM I snuck my bf into Marquee =) I feel bad for all the people who said they had to wait for so long , because this sneak in was almost too easy. We had a great time , met a couple for down under and partied with them at their cabana. My bf isnt too into Kaskade so I ventured off alone to the dance floor when kaskade came on he threw it down...

my biggest tip I guess for this club is buy presale ... and get there by 10pm.This isnt one of those vegas clubs where you can arrive at any hour and not have to stress about being able to get in, like PURE or something. In its hayday some of these still popular Vegas clubs were super hard to get into. But this is the new club and it supercedes anything else. I suggest wantickets.com , you can buy presale on there and you just go to will call and get your hard ticket. DOnt waste time in line .... time is money......... im in love with this place and I cant wait to return had the time of my life there !!!!!! =)",2,0,0

3k dance floor tables. That's a great deal for Saturday night especially when your table is as close to the DJ as ours was. (Shoutout to our promoter Jenn Tang\/Ryan Hodge!)

I haven't had bottle service at the Marquee since the last Kaskade summer lovin residency. I was pleasantly surprised (dispute a small snafu in line over ID's. She's 25, NOT 18) to see how quickly and efficiently we were seated. We placed our orders, met the wait, bus, and security staff and relaxed, anticipating a good night.

Security was great, and quickly took care of rowdy people from the table behind us bumping some of the girls. They also bounced some people looking for a fight. I saw one of them dancing bachata too! Haha

Wait staff was really attentive as was the buss. We had too many bottles but so many cups to pour into.

The 3k covered the minimum with some 600 going to included tips. We ended up tipping another 400 on too for a total of 4K. The table reservation comes with 8 comped entries but any extra females can be easily added to the guestlist. In actuality they said we could go ahead and just let security upstairs know and they'd let people in. That's what we ended up doing and at the end of the night, the comped tickets were still on the table.",0,0,0

The club has multiple levels, but a huge plus is the room that plays hip hop. I'm a fan of techno\/house and whatnot, but this feature is very nice to have to convince my buddies to go here. 

Given that I went with a group of people (mostly guys) on my birthday, we were better off buying bottle service, which to me ended up being worth it so we didn't have to wait super long to get in. Especially if it were all guys, there was no way we were gonna bet let in for awhile. This place is as packed as any other crackin' nightclub, but it kinda reminds me of Tao in the sense that it took forever to get around. I wanted to spend more time in the house room, especially since ATB was spinning that night and the crowd was super into it. The hip hop room is actually kinda small, and I expected the pool area to be a bit wider\/more elaborate. Still nice though. 

The bottle service waitresses were very friendly and attentive. One of the ladies wished me a happy birthday, blew air into my ear, and poured a shot of crown royale into my mouth. yep, friendly and attentive indeed. 

Overall, its worth a try to come here at least once. There's different rooms that provide music that mostly anyone can tolerate or enjoy, and yeah its pretty classy itself. Have fun peeps.",2,1,1

Once in the main part of the club, it was packed. Wall to wall people looking to get their dance on, but trapped like lab rats in some cruel experiment. The hip hop room was equally packed. Maybe I'm just too old, but it's no fun when you can't move an inch without some random dude grinding up against you.

This last time, it was for their one year anniversary, and Avicii was playing, so I'm giving this review one extra star because Avicii was killerrrr. The club is huge, but the main level's dance floor is actually pretty small. At a certain point last night, it got SO crowded that the bouncers wouldn't let anyone onto the dance floor. Not that I wanted to be on the dance floor anyways. I was there for awhile and people were actually less than a centimeter away from me or touching me. Definitely not enough space to do any enjoyable dancing, if you ask me. Another downside? The freaking stairs you have to go up to get to the club. Not fun in 4 inch stilettos! 

Pluses: great views of the city, a hip hop room below the main floor if you're sick of EDM, and a cozy library bar on the highest level to chill in.

I was hyped up and ready to party.  I picked up my tickets at will call and headed up the stairs outside to wait in line which it was 100 degrees out. I don't mind it as much as my friends did, they were dieing. I am from Vegas originally so I can deal better with it.   They need to add some ez ups outside so you aren't frying in the heat just saying, Anyway we finally get in after 30 minutes in the line.  Not too packed yet decent looking people had to wait a little for drinks at bar but service was friendly.  Drinks were good and strong.  When we got there Alex kenji was playing he was good but it was more like ultra loungy music then CLUB music.  So we got lucky to find us a spot along the side of the pool because once the people started flowing in the place was packed by 3pm. Kaskade came on around 2:30ish I think and the whole vibe of the place changed from chill to excited, pumped and just ready to have a good time. This was my 2nd time seeing Kaskade and he did not disappoint. He was AMAZING. there was bubbles in the air and CO2 machine going and great mixes and the pool was packed there wasn't any room left to get anyone else in comfortably. Once the beat dropped real good on every song he played  the whole pool was dancing and splashing it was awesome. So if any girls think there makeup and hair will stay yea right. It gets destroyed I along with plenty of other girls were pulling the fake eyelashes off hahaha.  GOOD TIMES KASKADE GOOD TIMES...

This place is amazing for two reasons! One the Dj's\/Artists that have residencies here are at the top of their game! KASKADE, SANDER VAN DOORN, ABOVE AND BEYOND, ATB, ARMIN VAN BUUREN, AVICCI... FREAKEN HIT AFTER HIT AFTER HIT! 

Not to Mention this place is beautiful! There are so many places to explore and venture into. The Library, the Outside Patio, the Pool, the Hip Hop Room, the Main room etc. 

The only reason why people would write a terrible review about this place is because they are 

A. bitter people, 

OR  

B. Don't know how to do Vegas the right way. 

OR 

C. Both

***Here are a few things to help you avoid a bad time at Marquee.  

1.)  If you are not of Female gender then BUY Your tickets PRE SALE! Get to the club RIGHT at 9pm! Get your stamp and go back to your room to pre party! Otherwise, you will shoot yourself in the face! I mean it! I saw some body bags.

2.) If you are going to the hip hop room make sure to give it a chance by passing the bar. It's literally insane but once you get to the dance floor I assure you there is room to groove.

3.) If you want to see the headliner get there early!!!! Don't move from the middle unless you absolutely need to pee! 

This place is amazing the poolside has a bunch of seated planters you can sit on. In my opinion you really don't need a table. If anything make friends and join other people's table. 

I have never personally been here during the day but I can only imagine it's insane! (Insane in the best way possible!)  

Oh as for the crowd... the crowd is whatever. You really go for the music. I live in L.A. I usually go to places for the vibe and the people. Majority of the people are all music lovers too. Honestly, it's just your typical LV crowd. 

What you see is what you get with Marquee! If you watch youtube videos it's almost the exact same thing... well even better! 

Their set designers are the cream of the crop! At Marquee you get bubbles, confetti, money (It was weird when the EC twins made it main on my face WTF?!) hahaha but whatever, lights, performers (Medina) was the SH*T!!!!, smoke, lasers, acrobatics, geeze the list goes on and on.

What is there to say about dayclub? 

Other than the fact that women who would be scandalously dressed up in evening attire would be jumping up and down in barely there bathing suits in broad daylight.

Everything is the same as it would be during the night. The only difference being is they will make you take the stairs from hell to get to the top floor(seriously, can't you just let everyone use the elevator?!). Is this what you do to people who buy tickets in advance so they can be less accommodated? 

Fortunately for you Marquee, I am willing to set those thoughts aside to see my man Kaskade open up dayclub for 2014.  Overall, Kaskade's set was amazing(as to be expected). Whatever happened to that supposed outdoor dome they kept advertising about? I saw nothing of the sort there. I would say the only downside about going to the day club is being doused by pool water from the people in the pool and random people throwing drinks in the air(I swear if I could hit people with the 'stupid' stick, I would).That's one of reasons I wouldn't want to come back.

Then all of a sudden they were selling magically available tickets for $20 extra.  It's cool because some stragglers got to come too.  I found myself in the boombox, and I dislike hip hop.

A group of us were all excited to see Kaskade and have a great night out.  We paid $60 a ticket expecting to see a great show.  And Kaskade did an amazing job.  So everything would have been great if we could have seen him.  Instead, they overbooked the club big time.  They pack you in like sardines.  They had the doors open to outside where it's over 100 degrees out.  

Getting close to the stage is next to impossible.  At one point we were dangerously packed in and my girlfriend was starting to get very claustrophobic.  We couldn't move at all.  And then one of the Marquee bouncers came barreling through, literally shoving people out of his way to make room for others.  My girlfriend was almost knocked down to the floor, where she could have been trampled.  

We finally, made it out of that pack and off to the side when Kaskade went on.  Of course we couldn't see him from that angle, but at least we could breathe.  What we spent $60 on I don't even know.  I've been to much better concerts for $60.  

I know Vegas is a different beast, but at some point there's a line to draw.  I have no desire to ever go back to this show.   I'd rather spend the money on a Cirque Du Soleil show.  We didn't even stay for the whole thing, we left utterly disappointed that we missed seeing an amazing DJ.

If you are thinking about going to this, don't waste your money.  Perhaps get there hours early and stand by the stage, but I'd recommend another venue.

Dayclub Review:
Nowhere in the world will you find more fake eyelashes, airbrush tans, and silicone per ounce of chlorinated water. Don't worry about contracting syphilis by sitting in said infested waters, as enough vodka is accidentally spilled into the pool to kill even the most persistent bacteria. 

The music is stellar, as some of the top dj's in the world grace the platform for all to toast their pineapple rum smoothies to. You might run into a Real World cast member or someone of equal unimportance. If you're lucky, Avicii or Kaskade may drop a solitary bead of sweat on you as they whisk you away on a musical journey into shitfacedom. 

I hear the cover is pricey, but I've noticed it can be absolved with the right inappropriate bikini or perhaps a well-timed 'that's what she said' joke. 

Nightclub Review:
The nightclub may get crowded, depending on what magnificent DJ shows up. I highly recommend shaking what's left of your dignity in front of the mainstage VIP tables, to minimize credit card and liver exploitation. If shaking said ass doesn't help you procure an invite, ask the nearest tweaked out person if they want you to be their own personal drink holder. Vegas is expensive... be resourceful..

I recommend pre-partying, post-partying and partying your face off at Marquee as it is currently the 'Big Kielbasa' of Vegas.",6,19,6

Our escort was Joe and he was super accommodating.  He kept apologizing for our wait and bought us shots to make up for it.  Instead of giving me directions to the bathroom, he personally took me there and waited for me to finish so he could walk me back to our table.

And the security guard was shooing people away from the dance floor and not letting anyone in :( I was so disappointed and bummed I couldn't see kaskade and that I was only able to hear him on the surround sound.. I knew half the people there wernt even there for kaskade and were there just to be ""seen"". It was so annoying. After that ridiculousness the boys in our group just decided for us to leave.

There's a lot of potential pitfalls, but if you just do a little bit of preparation, this place can be the venue for an awesome night out.

I have gone to Tao and XS and unfortunately experienced the well-known horror story of the entrance lines for Vegas clubs.  If you just walk up to a club and try to get in, the popular clubs will make people wait up to 2 hours... which is a buzzkill (both for your alcohol level and your energy mood).

This time, I made sure our entire group got pre-sale tickets.  I pushed for this heavily, and man was everyone glad I did.  When we arrived at the club, we saw a HUGE wrap-around line of people trying to get in general admission.  This was only at 11:20pm, so still relatively early.  I'm guessing those people had to wait at least an hour to get in.

By getting pre-sale tickets (a hefty $50 for men, $20 for women), we bypassed the line completely and were inside the club within 30 seconds.  Awesome.  I highly, highly recommend getting the pre-sale tickets if you're a guy.

Prices: Typical vegas club fare.  Cocktail for about $14-15 per person, beers are $8-10.  This is exorbitant by any normal standards, but typical for Vegas standards.

While we didn't wind up getting a table, I was told that 10 people on a friday night would have a $2000 spending minimum.

Now finally to the venue. It is amazing. There are 3 club levels, and the place is gigantic.  There's a main dance floor on the top level which is super crowded, with a surrounding walkway.  This is pretty much identical to the layout of XS.  However, this main dance floor has an outside pool area which is GIGANTIC and has multiple bars with plenty of space.  The top level is primarily electronic music.

The middle level is smaller, but still a decent sized space for people to dance.  This room plays primarily hip-hop music.

I didn't get to go to the bottom level.

Throughout the night, they consolidated the rooms and made people migrate to the highest floor.  I assume this was as the club was thinning out, so they wanted the rooms to merge into one so that it still gave off the ""crowded"" vibe and didn't seem like the party was dying out.  I actually have to say, an excellent strategy as when club momentum is dying, people usually flee for the exits.

The clientele was nice.  Obviously dressed up to a high degree, guys sometimes in suits and girls mostly in short skirts and high heels.  There is a dress code but it's not AS strict as they claim, as I saw plenty of guys in jeans and non-dress shoes.  I wouldn't risk it too much so just look somewhat nice if you'd like to get in.

The women were really hot.  Just sayin'.  Also, this crowd had a very large Asian bias, which was kinda surprising.  I'm not saying that it was an asian night by any means, but I'd say the crowd was about 30-40% asian, which is pretty high for a generic club night.


There are some negatives, so I can't give this place 5 stars.  The prices are exorbitant, especially the $50 cover for guys.  The drinks are super pricey so you should either be a baller and get bottle service or pre-game before coming here.

The bouncers never gave me trouble at all, but I can spot douche bouncers when I see them.  I imagine they can be trouble for some more inebriated patrons.

If I were asked by people which club to go to in Vegas, I would say Marquee without any hesitation.",3,0,0

Why is it that every time I go to Marquee it tops my last visit by ten folds with chaos. Time after time I ask myself the same question, ""What the hell am I doing here?"" and then a small sigh. 

Let's just get down to the nitty gritty:

The venue: quite beautiful. The entrance to Marquee is on the second floor of the very sparkly Cosmopolitan hotel which is located on the strip across the street from Planet Hollywood. There are apparently multiple floors to this club? But for the most part, majority of the crowd (including myself) are being squished like sardines on the top floor (which is the floor that the elevator takes you to when you first get in the club). There are a few bars located on this floor: one right by the elevators, another on the opposite side of the stage (you'll see it on your way to the restrooms) and the last one in the way back which is looking straight at the stage. There's one small dance floor circling the stage which is then surrounded by reserved booths and then more reserved booths and ONE walkway. Again, sigh.

The Line: RIDICULOUS. EVERY TIME! Wow. And if you're a guy, good luck. Unless you're getting bottle service, your guy to girl ratio better be 2:1 at least. Even though it helps to know people that know people that know people, even that ""I know so and so, I'm freaking special"" line takes about a good hour to get in. And boys, there's almost ALWAYS a cover. Sorry, guestlist won't save your pockets all the time.

Oh the thing that bothers me most is the maze you have to go through to get to the restrooms. To some people it may not be that big of a deal, but for a girl that wears 6"" heels and has a bladder the size of a mustard seed... Yeah, it really sucks. 

I want to rant and rave about this club, I really do. Especially when most of my LV club rats love this place. But I can't, I just can't. I will however say that they do for the most part have the best entertainment line ups. I've seen some really great dj's, musicians at this club and tend to run into sexy models and celebs. So yeah, I guess that second star is for entertainment. Good job Marquee booking\/PR peeps. Two thumbs up! 

+ One of the hottest clubs in Vegas right now.
- The crowd is overbearing. Especially when I'm constantly forcefully squished between sweaty strangers.
+ Entertainment is great.
- 007 mission to get to the restrooms
- 007 mission to get the f out of the club (if you leave before the club ends, they don't let you take the elevators down)",3,5,2

This place is complete chaos during the day. It's crazy crowded and the pool is filthy. There are so many people in there, there's no way to control who is...relieving themselves...in the pool and I saw disgusting things like bandaids and hairballs floating in the pool, around people!

The bar is also insane. I waited 25 minutes and left with no drinks.

I had so much fun! If you buy presale tickets, cover isn't too bad. I think it was $50 for guys and $20 for girls. Alcohol also wasn't too expensive, I think it was $15 for the majority of drinks. We found a really personable bartender that is originally from Texas and he made our drinks really well.

The club does get really crowded, and if you want to be on the floor where the DJ is that's not going to happen unless you get there early and stay there. Not being on the floor doesn't matter though, because you can hear the music and everyone is still mingling\/dancing where the pools are.

Also, I think my fiance was impressed by some of the things I heard from guys trying to hit on me.
""How can you text me if you don't have my number?""
""This is my friend Mike. Sometimes we call him Magic Mike"" ""My abs get better as the night goes on""
""Is that your smile on the floor? ... OH THERE IT IS!""

If we go back to Vegas, we'll definitely come back if it's still as good as it was this past weekend.

A lot of girls are complaining about the number of stairs. I didn't think it was that bad. Maybe the girls complaining just aren't used to walking up\/down stairs.",1,1,0

Each room has a separate DJ and therefore different types of music. The Boombox is like an underground club that was playing mashups of top 40's that night. The main room has a 40foot LED screen above the DJ booth! Around 1:30am, the screen opens up and gogo dancers get to their stuff. The library is a more intimate setting on the top floor that was playing old school hip hop. It's more like an actual lounge because there are chairs\/couches to sit down on when you're tired from dancing or just want to get away from it all. 

The outside area has a lot of cabanas and a couple of pools, but it being winter now, it wasn't that exciting to be outside - there are only that many heat lamps you can crouch around.

This review is for the Marquee dome day club

Pro's
1) Local ladies get in FREE. Most times local men too. If it's a holiday, men are $30. 
2) Covered pool...the ambient temp is about 85 degrees and same with the pool temp.
3) Area was relatively small but had 2 full functioning bars
4) Music was great...Jermaine Dupri was the guest DJ
5) Bathrooms were easily accessible and large! Not like your typical pool bathrooms....they were very clean and no lines. Had an attendant.
6) Crowd really picked up around 1pm
7) Ability to re enter...lines were not too bad

Con's
1) We should have taken advantage of the lockers (which are in the back behind the waterfall for $30) because all of our clothes were taken....shoes, pants, shirts....all of it 
2) GoPros aren't allowed inside, but you can still bring your phone and small purses.",2,0,0

It's a really great venue too -- 2 floors (the room downstairs is pretty small though) and outdoor area with pool. Girls are free on guestlist and guys on guestlist is $25 or $45 if there's an event\/famous DJ spinning. The only thing is, you need 1:1 ratio; if you don't, good luck getting in. Get there by 9:30PM to avoid the long lines too!

Definitely check out the day club! With the Vegas heat in the summer, the pools are sure to cool things down. Grab a few drinks and food at the bar, lounge in the cabanas next to or in the pool, dance, just watch out for flying beach balls! Party all day every day in Vegas baby! I like that they have 2 pools too. The big one is in the sun and is usually pretty full, the second one has a waterfall thing and it's in the shade; it also has cabanas\/seats in the pool! Tip: stake out a spot, lay some towels out and make sure someone is watching your belongings at all times! A friend's friend had her flip flops taken...not fun.

It's located in the Cosmopolitan, so it's an extremely nice place. We went on the night that Benny Benassi was there so it was CRAZY. The line to get in was super long, good thing my friends brother works there... cut our wait time down by a lot. Its a huge venue. Upstairs was more of a lounge like atmosphere. Music was more hip-hop, pool table, couches (which may have been for bottle service, I'm not too sure)... Basically a smaller room, quieter than the chaos that was erupting downstairs.

They have an outside area which is all bottle service seating. If you have bottle service in the outside cabanas, you will definitely look like you're ballin! They each have their own little jacuzzi... siiiick! They have other not-so-pimpin bottle service tables, which I'm assuming are cheaper.

Their main club area is huge. It's an amphitheater like area, tables around the outskirts, small ramp down, dance floor, stage up front. They have a huge screen as the backdrop with a catwalk going across where they have their dancers strut their stuff. 

I am a small girl from Hawaii, where I am not used to guys literally shoving me on the dance floor. I'm not sure if this sort of thing happens all the time, or if it's because it was a special DJ night, but that was ridiculous. It was extremely crowded on the dance floor, so there were people shoving me left and right. These guys next to us purposely shoved my friend and I to give them more room. NOT cool. There was a party of extremely drunk people who kept spilling their drinks on us. CRANvodka to be exact. Luckily I was wearing a red dress. My friend, not so lucky :( Her new yellow dress was RUINED. 

At one point, I went to the restroom, and after wasn't being allowed to get back on the dance floor with all my friends. There were bouncers at each ramp telling people they can't go on the floor because it's too crowded. Whaaat? ALL my friends are there, and I have to stand up here by myself. Pshhh, whatevs! I made a break for it past the bouncer as he was telling another girl she cant go to the dance floor :D

Best part of Marquee? CONFETTI DROP! In the middle of the craziness, they have a load of confetti drop from above and the crowd gets even craaaazier! Hawaii, we don't have that kind of excitement. That was the coolest thing! Yes, I am one who is easily amused.",3,4,5

The line can get pretty crazy, especially during special events like Party Rock Mondays w\/LMFAO. But it is definitely some of the craziest partying I have done in a long time and it made me feel like I was 21! Glow sticks, foam fingers, glasses, inflated zebras, dragon heads..... TONS of people and Redfoo on stage! The energy of the crowd is incredible and you feel like you ca party all night even though you are being blinded by lights and deafened by crazy loud music. The only down side is we got to our table around midnight, and the table next to us took our glasses and foam fingers....... WTH. But the cocktail waitress was nice enough to give me hers.

The sad part is when that table ran of out alcohol and was being removed from the table, the guy had the nerve to start pouring from our bottles! We quickly stopped him and then he proceeded too ask. We told him he should've just asked in the first place! GHETTO!

Came here on a Saturday night in March as well, and we just waited in general admission. The reason why it can take a while is because the elevators there have to take everyone up to the club, and with bottle service, VIPs, guestlist, and general admission, it can be very crowded and a little hectic. Took us about an hour when we started waiting around 11. But I highly recommend earlier arrival if you are going to be thru GL or GA.
Partied there last Monday during EDC weekend. We had bottle service again and the tables inside were all kinda tucked in the cornered. We opted for a cabana with a hot tub in front. So the tub wall is clear on one side and there are more people\/tables. And out cabana was on top. The tub was running the whole night, and all the girl were excited to be jumping in when we are intoxicated enough.

Well guess what? You CAN'T! So you pays thousands for bottle service, and you can't use the damn hot tub. Well then why turn it on? Why run it all night??? We were told because there were no lifeguards.... well the water is 3 feet deep..... Minus 1 star!!
They sell cupcakes as well, at $30 each or $150 for a platter. The are chocolate with purple frosting and covered in glitter! It was very sweet and I was too buzzed to really be enjoying sweets LOL.

The music is mostly very house\/trance\/pop, there is a 'hip hop' room downstairs, but it's kind of dark and small and makes me feel claustrophobic. =( There is a main stage, it's pretty air conditioned, which is GREAT! A downstairs room, and the outside\/pool\/cabana area. There were also some tables outside where people could gamble. This place is HUGE it can be easy to get lost with so many rooms, stairs, halls, bathrooms, etc. Drinks are $14 for a goose\/ciroq. Pretty standard. Magnum bottle of Ketel is $900 and goose is $950.

It was very organized at the door of Marquee. We got in quickly and proceeded to explore.

It is a big club and all of it wasn't open when we went.

The library is up too many stairs. it is chill up there, though, with a nice fake fireplace and books along the walls.

Going down the stairs from the library was treacherous in my 5"" heels. But I made it in one piece and went to look outside around the pool area. It was really hot and windy up there. Our eyes got very dry so we left to the dance floor directly inside. 

There was enough space to dance without being pressed in. The VIP tables were nicely off to the sides of the dance floor too, so not in the way.

Yes, it was very pleasant. The crowd looked polished and nice and wanting to have a good time without being overly lecherous. 

I would go back for sure. But maybe in a more comfortable shoe so I can fully explore without becoming crippled.

Great for people watching and it was no surprise that it was packed. Music was good and if you decided to go in the middle of the pool and stand on top of the clear cube, let it be warned that you will get splashed at. I actually liked the day pool, too bad admission was $20 for females and that was us hussling. The line was ubber long and dont forget to show up in pool gear or they wont let you in. Also, no outside drinks in either, they check your bags for that.

Now...for the night club, I personally didnt care for this place. It was way too packed and the line was insanely long. Longer than the day pool party. Actually too long that it was discouraging to wait. Once inside, I didnt think it was all that. It was actually small and crapped and no surprise the club opened up to the day pool area where I was just at earlier in the day, hahaha. You could barely move and or get around. Bouncers were not too kind even to us group of girls. Good thing we didnt have to pay to get in, but luckily we had pulled some strings for that.

First of all, I don't know how the world I even got in.  I don't even remember paying.

There was this group in front of mine of like 4 guys.  I swear, they looked like some foreign soccer team or something.  They might've been One Direction.  I don't know.  But they were all chiseled and crap.  Looked like freakin' Chippindales.

Enough of that though.  Remember in my previous review how I said the bouncers can be overly strict?  They take it to a whole different level here, but that's probably because well... the women are wearing a lot less than they would at night.  Unless they went commando at night.  I don't know.

Oh yeah, now I remembered why I got in.  Our girl-guy ratio was 6 women to 2 guys.  Yeaah boiii!

The vibe here though is much more chill than say Wet Republic.  At Wet Republic I felt that it was party non-stop.  You do get that vibe here, but I just felt like lying on my pool bed and enjoying myself.

If you can get in, good club.  Still though, I much prefer the awesomeness of Marquee's nightlife.",0,4,0

The venue is hella big and spacious and the layout is beautiful! but more space=more people. It was SUPER packed with clusterf*cks all around. 

Despite the inability to actually dance or more in the main floor\/stage area where Kaskade was, I still had an amazing time. The 2390293 flights of stairs was killer though. but I'll use that as my exercise for the weekend.. Someone told me there were elevators we could take?? But where?! I was already kind of buzzed by the time I got there so F it! Going up the stairs, like a baus.

Kaskade didn't spin until about 1AM. So the group and I just pretty much hung around the bar area and the hip hop room. We also checked out the rooftop and man, it was beautiful at night. Dunno how much the drinks were 'cause I didn't buy any =P But I don't even remember what I had except I know I had a kamikaze shot in the beginning on the rooftop level.. after that, it was a blur =)

the BF and I and a few of my friends started getting closer to the main stage to where Kaskade would be at. Once he came on, everyone was screaming and it got even more crowded that I could barely move my arms. It was ridiculous. But it was worth it. He opened with ""EYES"" and it's sad I don't remember a lot of the songs he played because I was pretty much dunzo at that point.. I still remembered he played ""Angel on my shoulder"" which is one of my favoriteeeeees by him! 

At one point I was sitting on top of my bf's shoulders with the help of some white dude behind us. If it wasn't for the random guy, I probably would have lost balanced and fell. But at that moment I couldn't care less. I was at my happiest and I felt like I was flying =) Red bull gives you wings y'know? ;) 

So was Marquee worth all the pushin' and shovin' and getting stepped on 3940394 times and ruining my new nude chinese laundry heels and bruising my feet and legs and a cigarette burn on my thigh from some random dude who put his arm behind him and my thigh just happened to meet with the butt of his cig?! (luckily, the scar is gone now)

but my answer is... YES =) Well, Kaskade was a big part of why it was worth it.

There were many flights of stairs to climb to get to the venue. Not sure what that was about, but when I asked if there was a lift was told to use the stairs. They must have an elevator, but maybe just for disabled? 
Anyways, once we climbed for what seemed like a long time, we got inside the club and it was lit! We danced our way to the middle and just let loose Vegas style! Lot's of fun! Be sure to check out the pool area too. Different music and different vibe outside.

met 3 of my exes here
so can you.

But on the real solid 3,5\/5 star block. It def was the spot when the edm boom overtook vegas, and finally reviewing a review for it after going here numerous of occasions.

Two floors (edm main room and hip hop) and lets be real you're spending your time in the edm room, if you wanna f with the hip hop clubs there much better choices in 1oak and body english.

main room def gets crowded on busier nights with bigger dj's expect a lot of shoving getting in and around the narrow walk aways and trying to get into the dancfloor and around is near impossible once 1130 and after comes rolling around. The one part is keep in mind there is nowhere to chill inside, secuirty keeps u moving unless u been getting that $ and have a bottle service inside.

I actually prefer the outside a lot more; not as packed, easier to go around, more relaxing vibe.  Had table inside and outside and I still prefer it being outside.  Off the top of my head 2 bars inside main floor (on towards the entrance between the outside and inside door seperator, and one when you first come up the elevator doors.  i believe there are two bars outside too and  35% chance of second hand smoke.

I def come back as some of my fav dj spins here from time to time (alesso\/armin\/dash\/yeah im basic whats it to you). shout out to my exes though, you guys went easy on my credit card the first night and not so much ever after.",0,3,0

Location (inside what is currently the hottest Hotel on the strip - The Cosmopolitan), music (nothing currently beats EDM) and entertainment (when the DJ comes on, they put on a great show). With these as a backdrop, it should be the hottest pool party in Vegas. 

But there are two negatives that harm this place dramatically, the first something that can be changed, the second not. I went to Marquee on a Sunday, the previous day I had spent my day at Encore Beach, watching Tiesto perform live. Because of the back to back experiences, I was able to compare them more fairly.

The first difference you notice, and the most troubling, is the dramatic difference in security rules. Marquee prohibits almost everything - your attire is strictly watched, where you sit while inside the pool area and where you drink are all controlled by Marquee security. For example, there are security guards IN the pool at all times, prohibiting you from bringing your drinks to the center of the pool - you could only drink, and have a drink in hand, near the edges of the pool. Oh and, you better hope that edge isn't near a VIP spot, as then that edge is prohibited and only allowed for those guests reserving that VIP spot. The security can be rude, overly excessive, and makes for an uncomfortable experience. 

This wouldn't be as much of a problem if it wasn't for the small space that Marquee beach uses. For those that have been to the nightclub, the dayclub is basically the same place.  A small upper level pool area (you get there by elevator) that only has room for one medium sized pool and a few Jacuzzi like pools around that pool. It pales in comparison to the bigger pools like Rehab, Encore Beach and Wet Republic. 

It is no wonder that it has been difficult for Marquee Beach to maintain that tier 1 pool party status. The top 3 pool parties, depending on the day you go, still tend to be dominated by the three biggest pools: Rehab, Encore Beach and Wet Republic. If Marquee beach ever wants to permanently take a place in the top 3, it is going to have to do something about its security force. Nothing else is as in control as their security is.

I hope they do, as their music taste and location make them a prime choice in the  pool party scene. It's such a pity that with so much potential, the hotel would let the security service ruin it's chances of becoming truly one of the best pool parties in Las Vegas. 

This is why on our next boys trip to Las Vegas we plan to do Wet Republic and Encore Beach. Marquee, mainly because of its security force, did not make the cut.",2,0,0

Marquee Monday is where it's at. Girls in for free, and if you meet a promoter and have enough girls:guys, they'll get in free too. Open bar from 10-11pm. When we went, only one floor was open (the elevator man said there's usually 2 other floors?) but that one floor was plenty fun for me. It was a little dead at first, but our large group just had fun sitting outside enjoying the open bar. The dance floor started to pick up later on in the night, and there was about a 1 hour window where it was perfect - full, but not too crowded. Great DJ that night, and lots of interactive elements!! Occasional blasts of air, confetti dropping, tons of bubbles filling the dance floor, huge glow sticks everywhere, fun lights, etc. 

I had no sense of time while here, but there was that inevitable moment when the dance floor got so packed you literally could not move. I repeat, LITERALLY COULD NOT MOVE. It was horrible. But the place was so large there were plenty of other areas to peruse and hang out.

Came here last Friday & Saturday night. Yes..twice in one weekend. We didn't mean for it to happen, but our Saturday plans got a little messed up, so we were left with Tao or Marquee again. Majority decided to go to Marquee again because it was Above & Beyond. I'm glad we went again. 

Music was good (especially on Saturday night!). House on the main floor. Hip-hop on the bottom floor. & more good music upstairs in the library :) Love that there's an outdoor table\/bar area too on the main floor.

Friday night, the girls were free & the 3 guys had to pay $30\/each. Not bad..especially for Marquee.

Saturday night, the girls were free & the 4 guys had to pay $70\/each. Luckily, the girls are such great friends that we all pitched in so that the guys wouldn't have to pay it all themselves. Great friends huh?? Haha. Totally worth it though. 

We waited in the guestlist line, but it wasn't for very long. No complaints. 

One thing that I discovered for the first time this trip was their never-ending stairs to get out of the place. OMG, I thought my feet were going to fall off! I've never gone out of the club that way, but someone led us that way. BAD MOVE. Very dangerous...especially with drunk people..or even drunk girls in heels. We did that on Friday night.

The Nightclub is amazing its huge the only thing ladies ladies ladies!! Those stairs are ridiculous especially when you have had a few cocktails! It's about 3 or 4 flights of stairs and is absolutely retarded not sure why they did it so be prepared for that. Women also find those guys on the street that can get you in on the guestlist on the third floor entrance there is absolutely no line up there.

The day club is awsome never been there on their busy days so I can't really comment on that. The pool is pretty good sized the servers are smoking hot and the staff overall are very very friendly. If you happen to be there on their slow days like during the week or something its free and much more laid back which I prefer.

The hotel itself is amazing well done!",2,2,1

Girls are walking barefoot because they cannot stand to stand another minute in their stilettos.  And I am only talking about the ENTRANCE to the club.  

We were in a bachelorette party of 13 and had reservations for a table and bottle service in the Top 40 room.  However, we had to wait in one of the many confusing lines for almost an hour!!!!!!   The staff knew we were there waiting in line, but could not accommodate us even though we had a reservation.   We waited, waited, and then found out that they could only stick our big group in the House\/techno music room on a small couch that only fit 5 girls.  The rest of us had to stand.  I can't stand music that sounds the same.  do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Boooo!  The bride was so disappointed.  

I'm giving this two stars because I was impressed by the outdoor patio\/pool section. It had a nice ambiance, but of course, we had to leave our table reservation with bottle service to get there.

It was my first time this weekend in Vegas so my friends suggested we go to the ""best"" dayclub which apparently is Marquee because of it's scenery. And I can see why- music, people, space, and the pool is immense! I had a blast at Marquee.
Everyone was super nice and friendly, the atmosphere was over the top and they even had a set up for pictures which is a plus!
My only complaint was that the bartender was pretty rude to me regarding payments. He would not accept two of my cards and I was very annoyed at his impatience. But other than that, Marquee is a great place to hang out with friends this summer! Drinks can be expensive, so pre-game! $17 plus tip for a small AMF and $34 plus tip for a large AMF.

A hotel that costs $5.1 billion to build constructs and designs the hottest club in Las Vegas but insists that the patrons of said club TREK UP FOUR FLIGHTS OF STAIRS TO GET TO THE ENTRANCE?! Wth?!

Common people. I'm sporting a mini dress, 6-inch Christian Louboutin platforms (admittedly, the shoes are hot for the design, terrible on the feet for comfort) and my hair is curled to perfection. Do I really want to walk up those many stairs to get into the club? No. Of course, the irony is that once we get into the club poof, there are TWO elevators that ""don't work"". I repeat, $5.1 billion to build this hotel. 

Honestly, that was the worst part of it. 

This is place is smart in another respect though - they have a slew of bars so not everyone is jam packed trying to get the bartender's attention to buy $14 grey goose\/sprites. 

The ambiance was sick, I loved the design, DJs (music), and mermaids in the pool. I see why people flock here. 

Would I go again?! Yeah except I might bring those dr. schol's ballet flats in my clutch the next time. 

Oh did I mention how difiicult it was to walk down those flights of stairs not only when you are inebriated but it also feels like your feet are going to fall off? Its not a fun feeling.

Looking through the reviews, I saw two very common complaints: the security and the stairs.  To get around both, pay in advance.  It's a simple solution that allows you to get around being harassed by the bouncers (if that even actually happens as often as people make it sound) and allows you to use the escalators to reach the top instead of walking up six flights of stairs.  It also will end up costing you about half as much.

Now that that's out of the way, we can talk about the actual venue.  The top floor is where everything seems to happen.  This is the house room where famous DJ's will perform.  We came for Ferry Corsten's show, and it was good as advertised.  Lots of the standard jumping, fist pumping (if you're into that), and all that stuff.  Definitely not disappointed, except for the fact that we got there at 11, and Corsten didn't start his show until 1:30 (maybe everyone else knew this other than me?).

The lower floor was mostly a hip-hop room.  The DJ that night did a pretty good job, but he couldn't save this experience.  This room felt tiny, especially compared to the top floor.  After about 20 minutes here, we all agreed to go back upstairs.

The outdoor areas were a nice touch.  As crowded as the house room, except with the luxury of open air, which became increasingly more crucial as the night went on.

Last points: the crowd that night was mostly good, although the drinks were more expensive than any other club I'd ever been to in Vegas.  Overall, though I'd have to say that this place has correctly been described as one of the better clubs in Vegas, although I'm sure much of the quality of the experience is tied to the DJ that happens to be performing on any given night.",1,0,0

We climbed like 10 flights of stairs just to get there and were treated like absolute shit..Luckily we met a promoter earlier that night who had VIP tickets to Bellagio's THE BANK nightclub. It was sooo much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I totally recommend going to the BANK... just look out of the hotel to find promoters and you'll surely get in for free and have a blast!!!

Can't have anything bad to say about this club. Came here in March 2012, got a table for 9 guys (celebrated 2 birthday parties), got 4 bottles, and one of the best hostess ever. Of course, was NOT cheap but worth the money.

Came back in October for Halloween with just my gf (whom I met at Marquee in March) and hey guess what?! The host hooked it up with FREE VIP entrance, no cost, no line, no wait! 

Had an amazing night both trips and most def coming back with my same hostess.

This past Halloween event with Kaskade was by far the WORST experience I have had at a night club in Las Vegas.

I think the people working the line do not understand what the term ""pre-sale"" means. What upset me the most was how the pre-sale ticket holders were forced to get in the same line as people on the guest list. We paid for our tickets ahead of time, so we deserve to be let in first. It made absolutely no sense to me why the pre-sale ticket holders were waiting in line for over 2 hours. It got to the point where my friends and I ended up leaving the line to try and enjoy as much of Halloween in Vegas elsewhere as we possibly could, in spite of how ruined our night was because of Marquee - the supposed best club in Vegas.

We bought pre-sale tickets to another club that weekend, just as popular, and our wait time was LITERALLY 5 MINUTES. Our experience at Marquee was the absolute worst, unorganized, and time wasting event and we plan to exclude this night club from our future visits.",9,0,0

But Marquee has STAIRS. How many times I went up and down these stairs, IDK. But it sucks especially for us girls who are wearing heels. My feet were hurting from my heels, and they rarely hurt! So Stairs is definitely a con. 

The atmosphere and decor is pretty cool. And the set up of the club is pretty nice. The first floor after climbing some stairs is Hip-Hop\/Top 40's. Pretty good if you like that kind of music. I know my girls and I enjoy it. The next floor is I guess the main floor. The guest DJs are always there and it gets super packed. I went there when Deadmau5 was DJing. So definitely the club was packed that they closed off the main dance floor. A con since you can only leave the dance floor but not go back...They also hand out cool foam glow sticks. Also on that floor, is the pool area. Nice if you want to go out for fresh air. The top floor is pretty chill. You can sit there and just watch the people on the main dance floor.

Overall, I still think Marquee is okay. Why? Because of all the stairs you have to climb. Music is okay, but I still say XS is better.",1,0,2

The rumor is true this club is off the hook! The entrance is welcoming. It's on the second floor if you don't stay at Cosmo you'll be using an escalator going up from 1st floor and on the way up you can hear the music bumping, jamming. There's that anticipation and you feel the energy coming on. The closer you get you can hear the music getting louder. You're ecstatic, customers who was a bitch at work is behind you, the break up you had that too disappeared... hahaha ok maybe it was just me. But you get the point :)

We always get a table. It's ridiculous waiting in line. There's usually at least 6 - 9 of us so it's not too bad. The line for a table is much faster. I think we waited for 10 mins. If you don't have a table easily 90 minutes wait, and if you're bunch of guys at least 2 hrs wait. And if you're bunch of Asian guys you won't get in. Forget about it. If you're reading this on your phone and you're a group of Asian guy waiting in line, just leave and blow your money on the poker table.

You can take off your wife beating tank top and wave like a white flag you won't get any sympathy. They don't want you. Yes bro, they expect Asian dudes to have moolah. Without them lettuce you ain't shit because you'll just dirty the club. That's the way it is. Yeah it sucks! It's not you, it's you without money and they want money.

We always call a promoter, Stephanie Tran, I think. We always get the table outside by the pool. Some time later mermaids come out for a swim. So with the table you get three bottles. So usually two vodka bottles, and a bottle of Silver Patron to jazz it up in case you had a really bad week or your wifey is cheating on you and you're in denial. LOL 

Also, you get a super hot waitress to mix you drinks. Heck she even take shots with us. Plus you get a body guard, Jameer. Some girls like to sneak up on our table and chill in our area. What do you do? ""Yo, Jameer see them girls we didn't invite them. You know what to do right?"" ""Yes Sir, I'll get right to it."" And with a blink of an eye they're being escorted off! 

Dude there are some girls who just come up and straight up tell me to pour her a drink. Yeah she's hot but so what. I just tell her, ""Yeah, no problem and turned and chat with my buddy, 'Lakers are not in sync this year right?!"" Sorry, I give very little respect to those girls who think men are suppose to roll a red carpet because they have a pretty face\/body. Blahhh, you got nothing to do with it. It's in your DNA.

But if you're nice, fun, and carry a big smile and tell me things like you're working for a research company hoping to find cure for HIV and you used to work for Robinson May folding clothes I'd be totally in to you. Heck even if you don't just play the role. It shows that you're down to earth, care for humanity, and ambitious. All attractive qualities in a woman.  

Trust me my Asian peeps. Get the table. If you're gonna roll at the hottest club go big. If you're a penny pincher you won't have fun here. It's worth it! Let the lady be the cheap ass. You roll big that's the only way to do it especially at Marquee.

Recaps:
Best club in LV
Get a table it's worth it! Can't get a table? Don't even go you'll waste your time waiting in line for 2 hours. Then you'll complaint the club sucks because it's crowded. But in fact, you're pissed off that you had to wait for two hours.
Nice added entertainment: personal security guard, mermaids, go go dancers. But not any go go dancers. They're blind folded in a red see through scarf and moved at the same time. And when the dance floor is exploding with energy comes from the sky are bunch of silver confetti. People just go nutsss!!! 

Our table by the pool was a minimum order of $2,000 plus automatically added gratuity and tax of $400. There were six of us so about $400 each.

First off, getting in ... Not the long long line like XS, but a series of long long lines, with signs..security was nice, but firm..in fact everyone was nice at the club. 
We have a friend in Vegas who is a VIP Host and helps us with the clubs and pool parties, so getting in was quick and painless at 10:30. up the elevator and we were in. As detailed in other reviews, the club has one large room, not as large as XS's main room, but pretty good size with the center point being the DJ's stage with a huge LED screen behind with room for a few go-go dancers also. The sound system was great as were the videos playing all night. Max mixed it up with some of his stuff and some current dance hits from other DJ's. 
The outdoor pool area is as big as the club inside, great in warm weather, not so when it is cool and windy. 
The boomroom was pounding and packed, the library was the smallest room and very laid back. 
All in all we liked the club and the people,. we made some new friends and are looking forward to checking out some more DJ's in the future.

They walked off. I of course followed in confusion. They pulled us outside to a balcony while the man still hadn't said anything. I said can you explain to me what is happening. And the man said you're smoking up my entire club. Give me what you have .. In confusion I said i don't understand my husband emptied his pockets had nothing and neither did I. The bouncer continues to raise his voice and I calmly said if this is how this club is ran I will gladly leave. Please return my husband ID and show us to the exit. He got IN MY FACE screamed at me and continued to rant about absolutely nothing. I emailed their company about his behavior and how aggressive he became but of course with no luck here I am.

Why bother paying for gym membership, when ladies, assuming free admission, can get a full workout just by going to this club. I sure did with the flights of stairs I had to climb whenever I wanted to visit another level. Speaking of levels, there are three: Main Dance Floor which leads to the outdoor area, the Hip Hop Room, and the Library. I liked the size of the main dance floor, I enjoyed the music of the Hip Hop Room, and I appreciated the quiet of the Library. 

I expected more from this club after hearing how amazing it was. However, I can say that Marquee is overrated and not the best club that Vegas has to offer. But it's definitely a place you should go check out, at least to say you've been there. I probably won't want to come back until the hype and crowd dies down.",2,0,1

me and justin b. were in this exact predicament over the weekend since we decided last minute to join our other friends at Marquee that evening. we strolled by Marquee in the afternoon and there was a kiosk at the DayClub check-in area with discount flyers (legit ones from the club itself). talked to some of the DayClub bouncers who were working who also verified that they were valid. showed up to the club at 930pm which is the same exact time my friends were told to show up to meet their promoter contact...with the flyer i got in for free (general admission for ladies was $20) and Justin B. got in for $45 (discounted from $50). no hassle, no fuss, no stupid lines and no planning ahead was necessary for a good time at Marquee haha",5,4,5

After a while of partying my girl had trouble walking the flights of stairs with her high heels. She slightly collapsed on me and hurt her ankle somewhat. Then later with the same foot she tripped on someone and the security that was around instead of helping her out he escorted her out of the club treating her as though she was drunk. He gave her an ""X"" on her hand as a sign she was kicked out the club and took us outside the casino. It was an embarrassing experience for my girl because she was not drunk at all.

It was difficult to get a seat, so I suggest that you group together your friends and spring for a cabana or table! This pool was SO much cleaner than TAO Beach's pool. THANK YOU for cleanliness! The crowd was a good mix, but I definitely saw a lot of younger people here.

NIGHTCLUB: Came back the same day for the night club :) Definitely different atmosphere. To this day, it's the most luxurious club I've been to.

as soon as i walked in, it's like the dj knew.  needless to say, i didn't even get to make it to the bar cause my ass walked straight to the dance floor to get my groove on.  a good way to start the night.

as you all know, vegas clubs get crowded as shit.  and even with getting on the guestlist there is gonna be a short wait.  it was NUTS.  so packed i was getting pushed around like a rag doll.  but the music just gets you through it all.

they have the main floor, and the library where they play billboard 40's music.  less crowded than the main floor but still rowdy as hell.

marquee seems to have a good list of dj's performing every weekend.  i believe kaskade and tiesto will be there the next two weekends.

i love the outdoor patio.  you get to inhale massive second hand smoke but don't even realize the harm cause everything's so pretty and white, and shiny, and etc.

the only downside is how incredibly packed it gets.  it gets so packed that once you leave the dance floor you're not guaranteed to get back onto it cause the bouncers block you off.

price wise, it was 25 for the guys to get in which was cheaper than the 40 the guys paid last time.  i bought a round of 6 patron shots and bill came out 84. pretty normal for vegas or for shots i guess.

One promoter approached me and my girls, which was a back-up to a back-up plan.  The promoter texted me hours before going to the club to confirm and remind me to be there before 9:15 PM.

So my girls and I were in line by 9:15 PM but the line was already long.  Since we thought i'd be nice to help these 2 guys and say that they were with us, we ended up staying in line for an hour because we weren't all girls!  Quite annoying but I guess, that's how it goes anywhere.

Two guys joined us again, my friend's friends who were staying at Cosmo.  Even if they also had another hookup, they still waited for us.  What's good about their's is that they didn't pay the cover charge!  Nice!

Going to the dance floor, you have to take the elevator to the first small dance floor.  On to the next dancefloor, which was the outdoor area with cabanas.  

The two guys we were with invited us to their room to drink.  Getting out of the club was super confusing!  It was a maze!  We passed by another room, which was on another floor.  Going out, we passed by a game and pool area.  Going back inside the club was no problem at all.

By our second trip to the club, the place was super crowded.  Leaving out was much more confusing the second time around.  

Overall, I only give it 3 stars because 1) we were on the VIP guestlist but still waited for an hr, 2) the floorplan was super confusing even when you're sober, 3) each dancefloor was small.

So a girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night at around 12:30, trying our luck to get in.   We didn't know anybody and we had no guest list.  Needless to say the club was packed with people inside and out when we got there.  We went straight to the general admission line without talking to anybody and started lining up.  The line was huge and we were a bit worried about not being able to get in but then it was actually moving so it wasn't so bad.  Although there's actually a bouncer at the end of the general admission line as well checking you out before you're even allowed to line up.  We saw a group of guys got rejected trying to get in line.

So we were just lining up, minding our own business and then something interesting happened.  A bouncer came up to us and asked us how many people are in our party, while we were still in the MIDDLE of the line.  We told him there's just the two of us, and then the guy turned around and started texting on his iPhone and 5 minutes later, the came up to us again and told us that he has a client with a main booth by the dance floor, right by the DJ booth and is wondering if we'd like to join them.  He said he'll personally walk us in and take care of everything for us.  This came as a total surprise but we thought ""Hey, once we're in, we're in.  If they happen to be creeps then we'll just go to the bathroom and not come back.""  So we accepted the proposition.

Having no idea what to expect, the velvet rope was lifted and then the bouncer took us right through the crowd into the club elevator and off we go into the main floor.  He took us to the booth and to our surprise it was a nice group of very friendly guys and girls. One of the girls was very nice and she came right up to us and introduced herself and told us that it's her brother's birthday and would like him to have a good time so she asked the bouncer to bring over something pretty girls (aww... thanks!).  So we hung out, have a few drinks, danced, talked... and then it was time to say goodbye.  

It was our first time at the club so we'd really want to explore and walk around.  The club was jammed packed with people.  The main dance floor was impossible to get in, and the pool area is beautiful but the pool water looked very murky that night it was kind of gross.  We got ourselves a glass of champagne ($15) and walked around and there were plenty of friendly (drunk) guys asking us to join them at their booths.  There are people dancing everywhere, the energy was great.  We had fun and we headed home.

Marquee is a great club with good energy and a good mixed crowd.  Lots of Asians, myself included, but also quite a bit of Europeans and good ol' Americans.  It's a great club to go crazy, or just to chill and people watch, but set your expectations right - you'll probably have to go through a bit of stress getting in, and there'll probably be a steep cover charge and drinks are starting at $15.

Overall, I'm still going to give my love to XS, my all time favorite.  However if I'm spending a weekend in Vegas and I'm spending a couple nights at a club, Marquee is now added to my ""must do"" list, just under XS =)",1,0,2

It technically wasn't really pool season but there was a huge tent covering and I guess a heating system to give that impression of summer, even though it was pretty cloudy. The water was pretty lukewarm, which was fine but didn't help too much since it was winter lol. They were playing the playoff game between Packers and Seahawks while the Dj was playing some music so I was glad I got to dance and swim while witnessing my hawks win. Obviously they stopped the game while Jeremih performed and I was just hearing from word of mouth of what happened in the game. Lots of beach balls flying around and I decided to keep one of them (;

We got pulled into a booth. Very cute and sleek looking white couch for my friends and I to dance on. There were liquors and chasers provided as well. We got this huge fishbowl drink (okay probably wouldn't call it a fishbowl, but it was huge) that my 12 friends and I shared. It was around $150 and it got us pretty drunk. Very delicious though!

I've been to quite a few nightclubs in vegas over the years and let me explain why I am giving it 5 stars.

The doormen were incredibly kind. Almost to the point where we thought it was weird. Usually they are looking to get greased like at XS and Pure.

The wait was reasonable but only because we got there at 8 and it opened at 9. We got in around 9:30. Of course we could have greased the doorman but if we are going to make it in before 11 then why bother.

Good looking crowd. At one point I found myself realizing that every female at this place was gorgeous. The waitresses, bartenders, and dancers are all dimes too.

This place is HUGE. 3 floors. The top floor has a nice chill area to play some pool or go out onto a loft to watch the whole crowd. The dance floor with Kaskade DJing is the flagship. The outdoor area is really nice with the pools and all. Smart move to make it a day club too. Something for everyone here.

Not sure how long this kind of spectacle will last as things change but hope you enjoy your time.

I had perhaps a bit of an atypical experience when visiting the ""Nightclub."" The first part of the night I was attending a private party that had open bar and was fully catered. Great cocktails! The bartenders are obviously well-skilled and know how to poor a mean drink.  

I don't know what kitchen prepares the food, but I have to say I had the very best ever ribeye I've ever had in my life! Directly from the carving board (poor guy did not know how to cut meat, but didn't matter) to my plate to my mouth. A whole ribeye slow roasted for 15 hours served from a poolside buffet - who would've thunk it? :) The JUMBO coconut shrimp were also a huge hit! The staff couldn't keep the trays full.  

Having already been inside decided to check out the inside club (no line, no cover - yay!). Super crowded, loud DJ, house music, I'm finally too old for that scene - or at least too old to not enjoy being pushed around and have drinks spilled on me anymore, so we only stayed for one - plus we had another private event at another Casino to attend. 

If you're young and hip (not hip replacement), rumor is Marquee is THE hot club on The Strip right now - so party on boys and girls! Here's Anthony Bourdain's take: ""Come ye lords and princelings of douchedom. Hear my clarion call. Anointeth thyself with gel and heavenly body spray. Maketh the sign of the devil horns with thine hands. Let there be the high fiving and the hugging of many bros, for this is the kingdom and the power. Now frolic and maketh it to rain.""

Not to mention I came all the way to san jose to spend my new years to basically get assaulted by some little punk at the club. I was punched in the face by an overly intoxicated, so called ""man"" and the bouncers failed to help me or kick the kid out. This was after the fact I already asked the bouncer to get the man away from.  I'm looking forward to getting my money back, as this was a waste of money and time and I was in fear for my life.  In fact, this place should be SHUT DOWN because it is not properly ran and definitely NOT SAFE. After being punched I was screaming for help as I was in shock and could not breath from getting the wind knocked out of me, It was so scary and finally a bouncer came and walked me out.   A big F-U to this club, the owners of the club, the people who ""manage"" it, and the bouncers who are a piece of a crap. I'm really surprised the fire department hasnt shut this place down. I recommend and warn EVERYONE to NOT COME HERE!!!!!!!! Not to mention the 6-8 flights of stairs you must walk in order to go inside the ""club"", the staircase looked as if you were walking  into a school gym, so tacky! So good luck ladies wearing your stilettos because it's def a work out climbing those stairs. Just an overall trashy, low-life, garbage, unsafe, piece of shit ""club"".",0,2,0

Not the biggest or the baddest club on the Strip. But very convenient if you are staying @ Cosmo....The club has not been improving and its same sh*t every single time there.

Although Ive only been here a few times Ive gotten a pretty good feel of the club. Its def better than most out there on the strip. You MUST get there around 830-9 if youre on the guestlist!! Otherwise you could be waiting for hours! My fave day is Party Rock Mondays!! Free drinks and neon, MAJOR WIN! Free admission for ladies and free drinks, what more could you ask for? The music here is always super good and the djs are sometimes the hottest edm ones out there.

They are multi level, here they have a boombox room where they play hip hop and reggaeton. The downside of that AWESOME room is its HELLA hot and crowded! LIKE HELLA HOT, NO AC FEELING HOT! Lol. They also have this other room, which I forgot the name, but its more laxed and has pool tables and is usually a lot less crowded.

The downside sometimes here is that they have hella stairs and if your tipsy boom goes drunkie! To you ladies in heels, yall are crazy but I commend you for doing it, Ive seen broads walking up and down the stairs in heels all drunk and did it gracefully! 

Sometimes they have in the bathroom an email signup for a free drink ticket! You know I be using all 3 of my emails! LOL. I know, Im cheap! But sheet, you can come here on an open bar night and only have to tip maybe 10$ all night. Where in Vegas can you do that!?

Anyway, I will continue to come here as long as I can get some free drink action! LOL.",2,4,2

Another small room is very small, booth tables around the dance floor, they play hip hop and top 40. Another library lounge with pool tables, we never found it. so I really don't know how it was, blame my 6 inches heels and this huge nightclub with ridiculous stairs at back entrance and the only way exit on Friday and Saturday nights. WTH??? Day club pool area with cabana bottle service, they play Trance too.  There are absolutely NO place to sit unless you have table reservations.

Thursday night is slow, only one line, but don't sweat on it, there is not so many people, line goes fast. Free for ladies, $20 for guys. Take elevator up, but they only open that one level small hip hop and top 40 room, a small patio for smoking, a main bar and small dance floor, no seats unless you order bottles, not worth that $20 bucks, but bartenders were very friendly, and all the securities too. we left after 15 minutes, another elevator down exit on first level. One single drink is around $16.

Friday and Saturday nights, here the crazy begins... 3 lines at main entrance on second floor, very short line for hotel guests, not too short line for table reservation, super long line for general admission, all the lines go to one small ticket window and one elevator. the result? there is no such thing as NO wait in line getting in Marquee nightclub! the table reservation line is even longer than most of the nightclubs at other hotels! hotel guests have the shortest line and the securities are very nice they let hotels guests in as soon as they can. 

2 lines at third floor back entrance, 1 is front line pass ticket holders, 1 is for reentry. the ticket holders line is not too bad, they get in faster, but the painful thing is they have to climb up 3 levels of hard stairs to get into the nightclub, same thing for reentry people. Girls I don't have to tell you how much your feet will hurt.....

Once you are in the nightclub, amazing decorations, amazing sound systems, amazing DJS, amazing day club pool area, amazing looking people, and extremely extremely a million times extremely crowded! NO place to sit and dance, No rooms for everybody, people who had table booth around dance floor were dancing on their tables and seats, because there was NO room on dance floor!

We climbed up 3 levels, walked around 15 minutes, didn't even dare to get a drink from the bars, and we left. 

We got stamps at the ticket window, it was free for hotel guests before 12, we got in very fast though. The key is to get there as early as possible, no later than 10:30, after that, it doesn't matter if you stay at the hotel or have table reservations, all the people go to ONE small elevator to go up to the nightclub. Imagine a nightclub is more than 62,000 sf, all the people within capacity go to ONE elevator  to get in the nightclub? LINES LINES LINES! 

$500 a bottle, small tables sell faster, only big tables with $1500 minimum left for add on tables. $30 for guys, $20 for ladies on most weekend nights. 

I would just order bottles if I wanted to stay at Marquee nightclub for a whole night, but still need to get there as early as you can for good tables, that's the only way do it! minus the horrible exit stairs still... otherwise, forget about it on Friday and Saturday nights. 

I would never wait in line for 2 hours to get into a nightclub with no seats and no room to dance!",7,1,3

This Cosmopolitan club has been the go to club for the last couple of season and I have a feeling they are going to have a pretty long reign at the top.  They bring in amazing DJs that perform on their main dance floor, I was lucky enough to catch Kaskade on my last trip.  Warning thought, if a major DJ is playing the main floor will get PACKED!  If you want to fight it out for a good spot on the floor head over a couple hours before they go on stage.  

Once you are inside there are three different themed floors, the main floor (house\/EDM), the Boom Box room (hip hop and pop), and the library (a much mellower vibe).  The main floor also connects to an outside area that has another DJ.  The decor is dark but very artsy hip in the color theme of mostly black and purple.  I'm not sure if artsy hip that is the right way to describe it, but those were the words that I thought of when I went.  Of course there are bars everywhere to help you dance the night away and fight away the cold if you are outside in the winter.  The drink prices are pretty standard for Vegas...expensive, but that is Vegas for you.

I highly recommend getting in touch with a promoter.  If you are an all girl group and it is a holiday weekend you should be fine getting in for free.  If you have a good ratio (I would say at least 4 girls to 1 guy if not more girls) than the girls again should be fine, but guys be prepared to pay at least $50.  If you are a big all guy group look into shelling out the big bucks for a table. When meeting promoters to let you in, be sure to find the Queue Bar that is a couple floors below the main entrance of the club because that is where they meet you to take you up to the club.  

The only reason why this place loses a star is because of the STAIRS.  No elevators! You might get to use one if you get the right promoter on the way in, but after that you will feel your heels ever step up and\/or down for the rest of the night.",2,0,2

I never got the impression that ""You're lucky to be here."" Instead, the impression I got was, ""We are happy to have you here!"" When entering the elevator to go up to the pool, the manager said, ""All I expect from you while you're here is to have a smile on your face, so let us know what we can do to make your experience great."" 

There was open bar on simple cocktails from 11-1, and in addition to that, we were also given 2 drink coupons once the open bar was over. 

When the DJ came on stage, there was a huge parade with inflatable penguins, beach balls, and best of all foam shooting out of the large artificial palm trees. People were cheering, dancing, and splashing like crazy! I've never had so much fun at a pool party! 

The private cabanas had private spas with glass walls so everything was on display, and water spilled over the edge of the glass as they would in ""endless"" pools. Pretty awesome design!

Girls adorned in Lady Gaga-like attire pranced about the premises taking pictures with everyone and dancing up on stage which added to the overall experience.

It was almost humorous how many times I was told by local friends I had just met and cab drivers making chit-chat that Marquee was the club of the moment. Since we didn't make it last time I made it a priority this time since I had heard SO many great things!

This time we were staying at the Cosmopolitan and they have a great little thing that essentially lets hotel guests cut in line which was AWESOME because the line was reaaaaally long. We chose to go on a Saturday night which was probably a mistake because it was really crowded and we had to pay the full $20 cover for ladies. We were glad that we weren't men because it would have been $50! Yikes!  Overall it was an interesting experience. Definitely had that ""cool kid"" feel which was kind of fun for the group I was with of early 20-something ladies.

Drinks were expensive at $14 even for well drinks. It was too crowded on every floor so there was really not a lot of room for dancing which was a bummer. I was looking forward to dancing when the headlining DJ came on but security had blocked off the dance floor which was kind of a bummer. Also traveling by stairs was a total pain, especially in heels. We ended up leaving early and I definitely feel like I didn't get my full $20 worth of nighclub.

I'm not saying that this is a bad club. It's just such a scene to get into and it is so overrated for being ""the hottest club in Vegas right now"".  So many other clubs are better or just as good and aren't such a pain in the ass to get into. I realize that that is half the draw, but it's really just obnoxious.

Both times that I came here, we had connections put us on the guest list with instructions to be here by 11 pm.  Okay, so both times we were late and that is our own fault, but still, the guy at the door didn't have to be such a douche about it.  One of the bouncers even tried to get us to bribe him for $100 a person. Sorry, no club is worth that.

It is really LARGE and really crowded which I guess is the draw.  But I found it to be annoyingly crowded.. like you can't move enough to dance, or walk from once place to another, and people are spilling their drinks on you...

We ended up waiting in the line to get in and it actually took less than an hour. Worth it to do it once and see the club, but I don't really need to do it again.

The outdoor part of the club by the pool is the nicest part of it, but unfortunately we didn't discover it until the end of the evening.

The club was upstairs and it was so beautiful outside with a bar, VIP tables, and just spots you could sit if you're not VIP. The inside was super crowed though. 

Didn't get to see Drake as long as I hoped but I guess that's what they mean by ""hosted by"" The DJ that played that night did a really good job with keeping the crowed really hyped. 

One thing I noticed is that you can really enjoy yourself when you're there but have MORE fun when you're VIP. I didn't have a table but the people who did were standing up blocking view (I get it, go crazy bc you paid more) I will definitely be getting a table next time. 

A few people included myself were standing behind the table having a great time. The first security let us stand there but the second one didn't even let us close to it which I didn't understand because when we all backed up, a ton of other people took our spot and he didn't say anything (bc obviously he cannot tell everyone to not stand there.) a little upsetting we got moved out of that spot without a reason.

I was quite surprised that the staff were not as attentive as they should be. I found myself having to look for someone to help me with something. 

The venue itself is pretty cool. I wasn't overly excited about it...just typical Vegas. We were given a table at the ""Boom Box Room"" (Hip Hop) and so we ventured off for a little bit and found that you have to climb multiple stories of stairs to navigate yourself around the establishment. I think I tripped a couple of times in my 5"" heels. I'm sure I'm not the only one that was upset about the stairs. 

Some good things about our night: We took our bottles to-go! I've never had that option before when I get a table, and I really think we just got lucky cause I don't think that it's routine. My only rockstar moment was walking out and through the hotel\/casino with bottles in hand. And I also enjoyed the music. I know that House is mainstream, but I like to dance to Hip Hop and so I was really feeling the DJ (I did notice though that they played a single song like 5-7 times).

We did, and we were the only ones not drinking. 10 minutes in, and he calls me over. He asked me where I'm from, and what I do. I told him I work in medical and I am a local. So this guy starts talking about if we'll take the old rich man up to his room, the one that was supposedly paying for the table & bottles where we were sitting at. He said if we didn't wanna do anything with him, to take him up anyway, but then convince him to go back down to the club to keep partying so he could continue buying bottles so we could continue to enjoy our night. I said ""excuse me?!"" What the h*** do we look like?!"" 

According to him, in their club if you say you are a local and of course a female, to them that means you are a working girl. Escort, prostitute, whatever term he was thinking.

This club experience is pretty awesome. Beautifully decorated. You take an elevator uuuup and it's PARTY TIME!

I like the room that plays hip hop, but it gets crowded quick. Main floor is ok if you like house\/trance\/techno (I don't know the difference). Pretty spacious dancing area indoors. However, my friends and I ended up hanging out outside. We made our own dance floor!

Pool has mermaids swimming in them. It was like they were inviting me in to cool off from the Las Vegas dry windy heat! (It was in the high 80s that night). Only bummer is that we can't go into the pool. Not even to dip our hurting, blistering, high heel wearing feet!! WTH!?!? 

You can play some games since they have tables outside. I don't gamble, so I can't share on any specifics. 

Drinks are expensive so PRE PARTY! The ONLY gripe I have about this club is the fact that you have to WALK down ugly stairs (think fire escape route) to get outta there! BAD planning on their part. Took my money and left me to cry walking down the stairs. :( No bueno Marquee!

WHEN: Mondays & weekends!

WHY: One of the newer clubs in town!

WHY: Mondays are industry nights\/local nights! So, it may be a good time for y'all local folks to mingle it up!

WHAT: I have been here a couple times already, and I despise the lines and the stair system that they had going on!

My family and friends decided to go one night (a month into its grand opening I believe), we had free passes to get in, got there at 10pm, stood in the glist line, and didn't get in until 2 hours later!! What the heck is that!!!

We went again 3 months ago, we actually got walked in by my new promoter friend, BUT we had to take the stairs to all levels!! They claimed their elevators weren't working! And, a girl cannot be in heels for 5 hours, or they just get crabby!! (Or maybe I'm just speaking for myself, lol). 

Another thing, I am not that much of a fan for house or trance music, but they sure do play a lot of it in the Main room! In the smaller room, or the ""boombox room,"" they play a mixture of hiphop and pop music. On the top floor is the Library room, where you can just go up there and chill, play pool, and or dance. That was undoubtedly my favorite room!

So... you wanna party Vegas style?! one word... MARQUEE!!!

I've been coming to Marquee since Jan. 1, 2011 when Kaskade had his opening residency for 2011. Let's just say that it was my best night in Vegas...over the last 4 years of Vegas fun. I danced the night away till 7am! yup :D talk about going hard.
I celebrated 2011 and my welcome to Las Vegas celebration that night (I live here now, yay!)... and since then I've been coming here pretty much every week with my friends who just moved here as well.

I'm here either on Mondays, Fridays, Saturdays.

Amazing DJs come through Marquee... besides my all time favorite Kaskade... EC twins, Redfoo\/LMFAO, Dirty South, Benny Benassi...  the list goes on... I'm excited for Eric Morillo!
If you love house music... Marquee brings it!

If you have the connections to get into Marquee or any night club on the Strip... that's always a plus! Luckily... every time I go to Marquee.. I never have to wait in the line... I walk right in and the best part... I get in for free!

Love the whole lay out! From the bathrooms, designs\/words on the walls, boombox, library and main room! Love it! The outdoor dayclub is beautiful as well! I love the jacuzzis and can't wait to enjoy the dayclub during pool season! I also love the performers on stage... their costumes are amazing and fun! It's like experiencing a concert every night you party there!

Add the confetti, blowing air, amazing lights, kickass DJ booth and energy from every person in the building and you got yourself a fabulous night in Las Vegas!

I'm so excited that Kaskade will be here once a month! Vegas locals are spoiled with all the talent coming through the venue!

I don't smoke, drink or do drugs...but I'm a dancer... so when I'm out... I'm looking for a place to DANCE the night away! :)) So there you have it yelpers... Marquee is my place to enjoy Vegas nightlife!

If you're planning on visiting Vegas or looking for a place to party... make it Marquee!

Dance like no one is watching!

This past Sunday I decided to stay the extra day and spend my time at day club... it was probably one of the better decisions I've made that weekend. 
BUT REMEMBER GIRLS! YOU NEED A COVERUP TO GET IN -- I walked into the hotel with shorts and just my bathing suit top (as I did the whole weekend for Daylight and EBC) and was told by security that I needed a cover up, good thing our car was parked rightt there so going back to get a shirt wasn't a big deal, BUT I can imagine how much it would suck if you were staying at somewhere other than the Cosmo and had to taxi back! 

Anyways, we got through the line fairly quick and painless (since it was pretty early 11:30AM) on a Sunday. Came inside and put our stuff in a locker equip with phone chargers of all kinds - $30. Day club had all the cabanas on the side, they have one big pool and this little pool with a pretty fountain thing next to the stage+bar. The bestttt part about day club was the fact that Marquee gives out free fruits and ice cream! The gorgeous servers walk around with platters of fruit kabobs and buckets of Big Stick popsicles and offers it to everybody. WAAH, talk about win! The staff is really nice and helpful. My friend accidently dipped her phone in water so we ventured off towards the kitchen to ask them for some rice to soak her phone in. The staff was so nice, everybody directed us to the right place and showed genuine concern --after around 5 minutes of waiting, a worker came out with a container filled with rice of her, free of charge! When we were leaving, a worker saw us walking towards the garage and commented ""OH, I see you got your rice, goodluck with your phone!! I hope it works"", ahh that feeling of being remembered. :) Also, the lady working inside the bathroom next to the cabana is an absolute delight! She's sooooo nice and friendly and bubbly and she makes you feel like you're having such a good time! If I had cash on me I woulda tipped her just for her company. Also, my nose started bleeding when I was at dayclub (FML RIGHT??) so I ran off to the bathroom and of course, she was ever so helpful and acted like a concerned mother. AHHH I love her.... She helped me out and wetted a paper towel with cold water to put on my head, offered me a chair to sit on and kept saying ""poor babyy, but it's okay you'll be okay"".. She's such a sweet heart, I wasn't even trippin about my bloody nose LOL. 

Anyways, my overall experience at Marquee DAY CLUB was a good one (night club will be reserved for a different day...). I had a great time, and I'm thankful towards their welcoming and hospitable staff.

OH* Another thing. No drinks in the pool. If you have a drink in the pool, you have to stay by the edge of the pool. and TRUST, they implement this rule, there is a worker walking around making sure you are not drinking anymore than 2 ft from land. Lol at first it was annoying, but it became pretty entertaining... poor guy... why don't people just listen to him.",3,4,3

A gorgeous club full of gorgeous people! My girls and I agreed that it would be very, very hard for any other place to top it... it was that epic.

The main room will blow you away with its 40 foot LED DJ booth, but make sure you check out all three levels, including the Boombox and the Library - you will be wowed by it all. The Boombox is a smaller underground club with a separate DJ, and the Library is more of an intimate lounge area hidden behind the massive LED screen - complete with pool tables, vintage books and offers more craft cocktails. And if you need to cool off, head outside, where you'll be impressed by the incredible backdrop of City Center views and the fabulous pool cabanas with see-through jacuzzis. 

We received rockstar treatment from beginning to end, and were fortunate to be walked right in. The GA line was scary long. We ended up dancing the night away at the VIP booth right next to the DJ booth, so it almost seemed like we were go-go dancers on stage. It was ATB's first night of residency and it was so amazing to be right there with him. His set was totally nostalgic - remember ""Till I Come""?! - we were partying like it was 1999! The dance floor was completely packed with a high energy crowd.

Ok, I'll give it to them...they have a super awesome line up EVERY weekend. Dash Berlin, Avicii, Tiesto, Kaskade, etc etc, it's like damn, I just wanna spend my whole life in Marquee. But then...you remember the layout. Sure it's all glammed up, but really, it's kind of poorly designed. The circular dance floor is SUPER small, especially at a place hosting such fancy DJs, so it gets too crowded like a rock concert. Plus air circulation is pretty bad. There's a couple ways to get outside, but only the main one is opened constantly to let air in so that basically means...no air, all body heat. The bouncers can sometimes be really douchy too. I get that they want you to move off the aisle, but when that big DJ starts his set and everyone's crazy excited and squished like sardines, REALLY, you can't move ok?!

So come here if you are (1) super crazy in love with your superstar DJ and must hear him or you will die (2) a hot girl who can flirt your way to a comfortable table with a good view (3) a guy who can afford bottle service and then allow that girl flirting with you to chill at your table.

Beautiful club!  The decor is rather surreal actually.  Only made it to the main room and the outdoors balcony, did not see the Boombox room.

Didn't drink at all the whole night but the dance floor was so good I didn't have a problem dancing the rest of the night sober.  It got crowded as hell when the star DJ came on at 1am but I was lucky enough to find a pretty tall dance partner for the rest of the night so I avoided being crushed.

Honestly I can't get over the dance floor.  It's way better than the one at XS in my opinion.  There's just something so entertaining about those crazy chandeliers going up and down while you're dancing....  Not to mention the trippy lights and occasional bursts of foam and cold air from the ceiling... pretty awesome....

All of my local friends always seem to have extra tickets and such. Well anyways, the line is never too bad, especially if you know how to navigate at the right time with the right gender ratio and set of tickets. 

My complaint is that they allow WAY too many people into this nightclub. It gets ridiculously hot and sweaty, especially when there is a big named DJ playing. In most other nightclubs, I don't have too much trouble leaving to get a drink or use the restroom then coming back to my group, but at Marquee it's pretty much impossible.

(This itself is a rarity from personal experiences)

We met with our party up in the library, and what a great hideaway that area is to get your night sort of ramped up before the headliner comes on. Our bartender Roland (sp?) was awesome. Friendly, would have a conversation with you, pour some amazing drinks, and mainly just help you keep a good vibe going. The library has it's own pool table and decor that makes you forget for a second that you are in a huge club. I recall like that area.

As the headliner (Kaskade) started we made our way down to the main floor. Yes, as others say it does get packed like no other. We kept ourselves kind of on the outside and was really there to listen to good music. Kaskade is such a great dj and crowd reader and can keep the energy going past 3am.

Really had a good time and was fortunate enough to have a superb staff experience. I can't say you will get that often anywhere else, and would bank on that towards the lucky side. Can't wait to come back again sometime.",0,0,0

No security keeping people from taking a seat at the table or stopping by and doing the things you'd expect at a high end club. It also took for ever just to get into VIP. This weekend, While the door douches decided whether admission was $30 or $50, I finally got in walked up to the bitchiest bartender I've ever met and got some no name Tequila. I didnt even think to ask for a specific brand, because usually high end clubs don,t even carry XXX tequila.  On the bright side, the music was cool and the crowd was chill. On this particular Friday it seemed to be an Asian night of sorts but that's neither here not there.

We were guest listed for Benny Benassi on a Friday night, but we ended up not getting there until around 1 am due to traffic. My friend's (fairly high up) promoter hadn't specified a cutoff time for the list, but the bouncers refused to let us in, claiming the list had closed at 11 pm. Even though my friend showed them texts from her promoter saying that we could come in, they wouldn't budge. Finally we just faked our way in by pretending we were with a table. They didn't even check to confirm. So, in summary, rude but stupid bouncers.

As for the actual club, I can't say I remember many details. I think the club was pretty big and had a lot of different areas that I didn't get to explore. I vaguely recall wandering outside onto the patio for a while and chilling by the pool, which was actually really nice. The crowd was just okay... they seemed to be a little older and more ghetto than the crowds I've encountered at other clubs.

I went to Marquee Dayclub on a Sunday over Spring Break in March with a group of girls. Thanks to a great promoter, Drew Morrison, my group received comped admission PLUS an hour of open bar, which included beer and well drinks. Thanks Drew! 

Check in was a breeze. Security, for once in my life, were actually really nice, funny people. They smiled (gasp!) and joked around with us. Before going on the elevator, they wished us well. I've never been to a club with nice security staff before, so that alone warrants an extra star! 

We arrived early enough to find a place to sit by the pool. If you aren't renting a cabana or a day bed, you have to sit on the floor or stand in an awkward spot. At least the Dayclub provides towels free of charge to sit on! It started to get really crowded around 3PM. SAVI was the headlining DJ. The music got louder as the Dayclub filled up. As far as drinks go, the bartenders were quick and friendly.  

Worth a a Return Visit?
Everyone in my group enjoyed hanging out at the Marquee Dayclub. I would definitely come back.

We had gone to XS, Surrender, Hyde, and Haze throughout our week in Vegas, and had bottles every night.  That being said, the issue with Marquee is that there is no air of exclusivity, in that, the line is very long, but it seems like by the end of the night every single person that was in line is packed into the club like a bunch of dying fish.  We went on the night Chuckie was performing, and it literally took 30 minutes to explore this massive club (due to the sardine factor).  Even with a bottle, we were not having a very good time.  Our bottle waitresses were rude, and they decided to close down our section (after paying nearly $800 for our single bottle of Belvedere).  They offered to move us but since we had a quarter of a bottle left, and we were nearly out, they basically said buy another one and we'll move you, and if not we'll just stare at you till you feel pressured enough to leave.  I very nicely approached them in their staring contest and let them know I did not appreciate their staring contest, to which they insisted it was not what it seemed and continued to stare at us.  
  I have had Skyboxes at LIV, have tables 2-3 times a week here in DC, have been to Vegas 3 times in the past year, gone to clubs in NYC (near where I grew up) constantly, and have never had a more pompous and underwhelming experience.  I am sure if you come here with $5k-10k to spend you will have a wonderful time, but for that money, I would hop a flight to Miami, and go to LIV, which I will continue to argue is the best nightclub in the world (especially their skyboxes), as there is an air to exclusivity and service that is simply incomparable to any other experience I have ever had.  All of my friends decided that Hyde @ Bellagio is the perfect place for us in Vegas, they are more reasonable, more exclusive, and the view can't be beat, inside and out.

It was kind of weird. We were located at the boombox room. They played very FUN music - I mean music that you can dance to and not have to be on drugs to listen\/dance to.

It was so packed that the bouncers didn't allow anyone who didn't have a table to stand in the same spot for more than 20 seconds. This is probably because it would be hazardous to a crowd if something were to happen, which is understandable, however, I wish that the club could be designed so that people who are not forking out thousands of dollars for a table can enjoy the DJ. I think if you are willing to spend thousands of dollars on one night at a club it would be a great place to go to. Everyone who had a table seemed to be having the time of their lives. The bathroom had a separate room where there are plenty of mirrors for girls to hog. i didn't like climbing like 6 floors with heels to reach the right one.

Since Marquee is being touted as the newest ""hot spot"", my gfs and I decided to check it out.  We were able to get on a guest list (provided we got there at 8:30) so we could get free admission.

Getting in was relatively quick and easy. Since we were inside before the rest of the crowd, we wandered around to check out the decor.

First thing (to all the girls out there).. there are a lot of STAIRS. Stairs up. Stairs down. And there are 3 levels. If you're scared of the stairs like I am, then this can cause a bit of a problem.  Also, the very top level is just a small lounge with a pool table. No point in making the hike up unless you really really want to check out every corner of this place.

The dance floor inside is pretty small (for the main floor). Although they told us it was for house music, the dj ended up spinning mostly club hits and other top 40 songs, so my gfs and I had a blast.  Plus, its easy to pop outside for some fresh air (and more dancing).

The party was ok, the music was good, but the thing that bothered me and probably the reason I won't go back is the BAR. 
Made me feel cheated.
I order the same drink(vodka+redbul) 3 times on the course of the night.
-First time , relatively early, I was charged $15, which is completely understandable. I was alone 
-second time, middle of the night, I approached the bar again, alone, the bartender charged me $18. I asked why is the difference, and she replied that ""that's the price and I shouldn't lie. I explained to her that in my eyes the addition of $3 is her tip and I'm not gonna leave a single dollar.
-third time u approached the bar, this time with a female friend of mine, and ordered the same drink for both of us I was charged $20!!!!! It's an addition of 33% which is a lot of money. Same place same bar same bartender. I promise you that I didn't leave a tip.
Now, I have no problem with a bar that over price is drinks, completely understandable. But a bar that the price just goes up through the night or by the bartenders choice, that's a real scam. A place that respects itself should have fixed price list and not let it vary  according to the bartender\/client like kiosks selling! Absolutely unprofessional!

I call everyone to keep their receipts from the first drink of the night at the marquee and show it when you about to buy your second one cause you WILL be overcharged. Personally I'm not gonna tip a bartender that thinks of me for a ride and if more people will do like me eventually they will feel the change and stop doing it.

Vegas pool parties are probably the most insane in the world. Be prepared to roll with the craziness.

We went on a Saturday to see Hardwell, and after having a couple of drinks at our hotel, we walked over to Dayclub at about 1pm. There was a tiny line in Cosmopolitan, so we were able to pay ($40 for guys, $20 for girls when we went in with 2 guys and 1 girl) and get to the 2nd line outside the pool in no time. 

Once inside we realized the magnitude of what we were getting into. No, you're not going to get a chair to lay on unless you already reserved a daybed or cabana, and you're not going to have a place to really stand unless you're in the pool.

So, we dropped all our stuff at one of the locker and headed straight for the bar. Our bartender was fantastic! Strong drinks and was always easy to get to. Beers are $10 and drinks are $13 or so. Be prepared for a massive tab at the end of your day.

The crowd was already energized by the music and alcohol by the time we got there, so it was fun from the first second. 

I'm not underestimating the fact that this place had the highest number of attractive people I've ever seen in one place. Lots of eye candy for girls and guys! 

We hung out the whole day in the pool and the crowd was great, especially when Hardwell went on. Beach balls and splashing all over the place, so cover your drink at all times!

I love, love, LOVE house\/trance music and that's all they played.  Drinks were delicious, especially the frozen drinks. (I highly recommend the ""painkiller"")  The cocktail servers were attentive.  The pool was smaller than some of the other pool parties, but they had beach balls and everybody was playing water volleyball with each other.

Nightclub:
It's definitely A LOT bigger than it looks.  The interior design is classy and posh.  Drinks were pricey, but it IS Vegas... the music was good on every different floor.

Elevators up, main floor. ""the library"" themed room with sexy librarians standing around, a pool table and lots of seating. ""boombox room"" downstairs with a tiny floor and more private seating.

I loved the outside portion with parka-ed dancers and fire lamps for warmth.

Drinks are the usual $12, and ehh not too strong not weak but could be better. 

Bouncers and guards were so nice and joked with us about not letting us into the stairs area. Nicest guards I've met on the strip so far.

Ok I'm done being annoying now. But one more time I LOVE MARQUEE! I've been here about 6 times and each time was a blast!

I love the fact that there are 3 different levels and each level plays different types of music. Sure there are stairs, but you have two options: use the elevator or walk up\/down the stairs slowly while holding on to the railing lol. 

I'm usually downstairs in the Boom Box Room and yes it's small but the music is usually on point! I also like the Main Room and The Library too.

The pool area is nice especially when you need some fresh air after dancing.

::Experience::
~Day Club~
The line wasn't long, we got in pretty quick. To get to the Day Club we took the elevator then we were escorted to our poolside Daybed.  The bed was a little smaller than a full size bed and bigger than a twin size bed.  It was cool to be so close to the pool! 

~Night Club~
I got in the guest list and had no problem getting in; the wait wasn't long either.  Inside they played Edm music and outside Hip Hop.

Excellent! The staff was very friendly, polite. and attentive.  The food and drinks took a while to come though.

::""Meh"" Moment"" (Night Club)::
Just a little one.  I had a wrist band which meant open bar but the Bartender still charged me for the drink.  After bringing it to his attention, he apologized and said that he didn't see it.  Hard to believe but everything turned out fine.   He gave us an extra drink. 

::Rating::
Overall I am giving it 3.5 Stars (rounding it off to 4).  The venue is nice but not a ""wow"" factor.  Nice staff  and I liked the music they played.  What also helps is the fact that I had fun.  Often it's not so much where you are or what your doing,  it's who your with.  My friends and I had a great time!

*Nightclub*

Instead of a logical system for entering the club (with signs or helpful personnel), there's a ridiculous swarm of people kinda sectioned off in twisting lines. We had to approach 3 different doormen  just to find the correct line. We opted to buy the All Access Weekend pass and that did seem to help by cutting the entry process down to about 10 minutes total.

Now I'm a little torn on the rest of our experience because there were some genuinely enjoyable aspects.

*The club is actually really beautiful. 
*The views are fabulous
*The music was was legitimately good and exactly what you would expect it to be for a Vegas club

Unfortunately all of the good stuff was nearly canceled out by:

* The ridiculous herding system they have in place with staff constantly directing you with flashlights in big circles. They make it near impossible to just find a spot to hangout out in. If you want to sit, you're gonna have to pay for it.
*The dance floor is ridiculous. Well, the entire place is pretty ridiculous, but especially the dance floor. I'd read the reviews before hand so I expected it, but it was beyond what  I had imagined. You're literally packed into the most uncomfortable mass of people. As hard as you try, you just can't seem to enjoy yourself. 

**Dayclub***

Basically the same as above. However, I found the Dayclub far more enjoyable. The people watching was pretty fantastic. Nearly everyone was good looking, half naked and either drunk or well on their way there. Whats not to love?!
My friend and I found a nice little spot to sit right by the pool which was filled to about capacity. This was EASILY the murkiest water I have ever seen in my life with about 1 foot visibility. I saw a woman drop her sunglasses in the water at one point and as she dove down to grab them was warned ""Don't open your eyes! You might end up pregnant!""

Kinda skanky yet fun!  This is, after all, what you come to Vegas expecting.",4,4,4

We all knew going in that we were going to\/had to get a table and our friend\/promotor told us that we would need to arrive early to get a good table.  Unfortunately, one of my boys and I blacked out from the day party at Encore.  So instead of arriving around 900PM, we get there around 1100PM with little hopes of getting a table at that point.  The line was crazy long but fortunately, my friend does work and manages to score us a table.  We were told it was going to be a small table inside, but instead we got a pretty legit outdoor table\/daybed that was situated in the middle of the outdoor area.

As other reviewers have stated, there's tons of stairs.  As an athletic male, I wouldn't normally be complaining but I just had my cast removed from Achilles surgery a week  before and I wasn't about trekking all those stairs.  I sat my ass down as soon as we got to the table.  We get the bottles and mixers situated and within seconds, the ladies, heaux, drink vultures made their rounds.  I was still feeling it from earlier but the drinks kept flowing, the music was right so it kept me going.

From the little I remember, there was a good mix in the crowd but still tons of asians and whites.  It was pretty much NorCal and SoCal as every group of girls we meet that night seemed to be either from the bay or the OC\/LA area.  Not complaining, just saying.  It was a packed crowd but everyone was cool, - no drama and everyone had good vibes and a good time.

The only negative of the night was when my boy was signing the tab for the table.  Our hostess kept saying that his signature needed to match his ID, WTF.  Keep in mind that we ordered a few magnums and had been raging hard in the daytime so he was obviously not all there.  It was an epic signature fail.  After over ten signature tries, I think the hostess was finally fed up and said eff it, close enough.

Will definitely return to the nightclub and check out the day club when I return in the near future.",0,0,0

My night started off as a complete disaster thanks to those guys. My group and I got in the guestlist line by 1030. We reached the front after a longg 45 minute wait expecting to get in without any problems. Once we start entering, a random girl slips in pretending to be part of the group and runs into the club, out of sight. Realizing the number in our group was off, the bouncers prevent me and my friend from entering and force us to get out of line. We tried to explain exactly what had just happened, but they would not listen. At first they assumed we were lying, then they started telling us its OUR DUTY to make sure that girl didn't cut us.. right bc that was totally preventable. And no, that's LITERALLY the security's job. As we attempted to explain ourselves more, they immediately start CUSSING US OUT and YELLING at us in front of everybody to leave. I'm a pretty nice guy, so one could imagine how unwarranted this reaction really was. 

These doormen would just not have it with us, so I approached another bouncer and explained our situation to him. He was at least willing to hear us out, but basically said 'you guys got screwed tonight but we can't do anything about it.' He then tells us that if you're staying at the cosmo hotel, you get 2 free comps and that the hotel guests have a separate line where you don't have to wait nearly as long.

So we follow his instructions and went to the hotel front desk to make those arrangements. They told us that guests do get comped, but normally aren't allowed in after 10. There's also no such as a 'separate hotel guest line.' So basically, the bouncer straight up LIED to us to get us out of his face. We called the resort manager down, who tried to help but couldn't because Marquee is a completely outsourced 3rd party company.

As a last resort, my friend and I got back in the guest line hoping that maybe they'd let us in if we explained ourselves again at the front. After another 45 min of waiting in line, we asked another bouncer for the club manager. He was nice enough to explain the situation to him, so the manager escorted us to the front where they let us in. Hallelujah. 

I appreciate the effort of the manager and that bouncer, but I can't give this place any more than one star for the cussing, yelling, and lying my friend and I endured from the doormen for the 2 hours we tried to get in. Let's identify the doormen who caused this, shall we? The man and woman working at the third floor entrance on 12\/19 11 - 11:30 pm. Based on other reviews, this disrespect doesn't seem to be an isolated incident at marquee.

My experience inside wasn't the greatest either. it lacks a large middle dancefloor space.. Seems like only 10% of attendees can fit into the main pit area. If you're trying to dance and go hard to your favorite dj, this isn't the place to be. For those of us who get in late and aren't allowed in the middle, you basically spend all your time standing\/chilling in the outdoor areas where theres space. That wasn't so exciting. The pit is also the only place where the sound quality is decent. Disappointing time here. Not the place I'll be returning to next time in Vegas.",3,1,1

We had another friend in line, a girl, but they refused to let her in with us because the paper said 3 people even though the guest list had us down for 4. So, then we asked to just pay for the 2nd guy. As it turns out, they should have told us to pay downstairs and he told us to go back to the first line and wait again. I asked to speak with a manager and was met with verbally aggressive responses from 3 male employees. They raised their voices and told us to get out of line, almost as if they were about to push us. This was totally unnecessary and disrespectful. I expressed my dissatisfaction to another employee who informed me, ""well I didn't hear anyone yell at you.

This club brings in the big boys of EDM!  Atmosphere is great, could be a hassle to get in.  I've been here about 4 times and 2 of those times were VIP, about $6k the first time and $5k second time.  It's much better if you have a few friends you can split the cost with, and its totally worth it simply for the real estate you get as this club can and usually does get PACKED!

SO, is it expensive?  OF COURSE!

Does it regularly bring in mega names (Above & Beyond, ATB, Gareth Emery, Ferry, Benny, etc...) with Kaskade as resident DJ?  YES!

First of all, you have the outdoor pool area where the dayclub is--the pool is in the middle surrounded by the beach beds and cabanas. The depth of the pool is around waist\/chest height, which is think is a little too deep cause when the DJ plays, drunk people like to splash the water and it becomes VERY chaotic (a sista's false lashes fell off her face, that's how chaotic it is LOL). There's two bars, one near the bathrooms and one directly opposite near the entrance. 

The nightclub is even worse...the DJ plays inside and the layout of the club is a circle (like a donut)--the DJ and the main dance floor is in the center and the tables are surrounding the dance floor. This shouldn't be a problem except the dance floor is TINY and the hallway is also tiny so it's extremely difficult to move around the club (to go to the bathrooms and everything). 

Overall I love the DJs playing here but I just wished the layout was a little more friendly.",7,6,4

It was close and had both House and Hip-hop music. We arrived around 2 AM and there was no line and alot of men standing on the dance floor. Barely any women. Then we went outside to the pool area where there was hip-hop playing there. The music was very marginal in both rooms.This place is getting three stars because the dancers were gorgeous and wonderful to look at. Cost us $45 for men and $25 women- full price at 2am!

Where was this place when I was single and had somewhat of a decent body?  

There are lots of people there that make you wish you did some push ups and sit ups before going there but there are also plenty of people that make you glad at least you don't look like them.

No one really cares what you look like there unless you're really hot so just be comfortable in your swimsuits.

Cons: The choice of music on a Saturday night could have been better. I get that you have to play a mix of both EDM and Hip Hop but why add the constant blinking lights?! Got me nauseated!

I guess thats how these kids dance these days???
Lastly, the HORRID flight of stairs to get into the club! Really??!! Someone needs to go back to the drawing board on that set up. Its terrible! I think its 6-8 flights.

""Las Vegas' hottest club is Marquee.  This place has everything.  Lights, confetti, cold air, foam, ballerinas, mermaids, a cool bartender with nerd glasses, and just when you think the fun is over, unce unce who is there?  It's Kaskade!""

But forreal, Marquee Nightclub is pretty tight.  The space alone is unique and stands apart from all other clubs in Vegas right now.  I am not saying that it is the best layout but it is different for sure.  The endless stairs to get from floor to floor in Marquee made me thankful that I wore sandals instead of heels.  The stairs aren't even nice stairs, they are fire escape stairs haha.  There is the top trance main floor where they have the famous DJs spin.  They have a hip hop floor but I only saw that floor when I was trying to get up to the trance floor.  I heard the music was good.  But I needed to be with Kaskade.  There is a library floor on the top, but once again, too focused on the trance dance floor.  You can wander outside where the Dayclub and pool area is if you need to get some air.  It is right outside the main dance floor and there is a big screen projecting what the DJ is doing inside so you can still be part of the trance love.

I really love that Marquee brings in the hottest DJs from around the world to spin.  It is even cooler that Kaskade is their resident DJ.  Freakin' awesome!  Marquee is raising the bar for Vegas clubs.  I wish I was there this weekend to see ATB and Armin Van Buuren.  The Dayclub brings in pretty cool DJs as well, but it's all about the night.  At night the music comes alive and the lights are beautiful.  The giant screen behind Kaskade was pretty mesmerizing... as were the ballerina dancers accompanying him.  The effects such as the bursts of cold air and the foam falling from the ceiling make the experience even better.

Getting in can be a tough feat.  My friends and I all bought tickets for Kaskade in advance so that we wouldn't run into any problems the night of.  Female tickets $20 and Male tickets were $60.  But if you contact a promoter (shout out to Jenn Tang!), she can give you passes for the girls to get in free and discount for guys!  We all had tickets except my bf who decided to go to Marquee at the last minute, after the online sales had stopped.  He wasn't able to wait in the stand-by line alone because you need a 1:1 ratio of girls to guys.  So they told him to come up with the ticket holders to see if he could buy a ticket.  Amazingly he was able to.  The bouncers were being extra nice... maybe cus he was with 5 ticket-holding girls at the time.  He used a discount card and paid only $45.

I would recommend girls to go to the all girls line with a pass on the 3rd floor.  Guys I would say buy tickets in advance.  Even with guest list the line is ridiculous.  Get in early (9-10pm), get your stamp, go back to the hotel, preparty, return by 11pm.  Kaskade didn't start playing until 1am but you want to be on the dance floor maybe by midnight so that they don't close it off.... which they did periodically cus the floor is tiny!

As for the Dayclub... you can contact a promoter to get you on the list because I would not pay to get in to this pool party.  There is basically no where to sit if you didn't buy a cabana!  My girls wanted to lay out and tan, but with such limited space, it was nearly impossible.  You must have swim attire on.  Two girls got kicked out of line in front of me cus they didn't have bathing suits on under their clothes.  Don't bring a backpack.  My bf had to walk back to our room to put his backpack away.  By the time he got back, we had realized that it wasn't worth it to stay.  Dayclub is not the best.  The private jacuzzis by each cabana are pretty cool though.

1. I got bit. This is the 2nd time a stranger has bitten me (first time was a girl -_-), and I'm going to say that is the single most invasive thing you can do to someone at a club. I don't know what kind of Twilight vampire or The Walking Dead zombie fettish is compelling people to commit such acts, but stop. Please. I can feel the imprint of the teeth way longer than I want to. Just. Stop.

2. The crowd was...a mosh-pit. Literally. It was just. Impossible. We were up on one of the tables for awhile, with an awesome group, but some tight ass told us he'd call security on us. And gave us glow sticks. Interesting characters in this club. As we tried to go back outside next to the pool, we got swept away by the sea of bodies. That. was just. really unpleasant. And is also where I got bit. 

3. The lines to get into the club was ridiculous. We were in line for VIP\/guestlist for a really long time. I had to go back to the hotel with a friend with evil shoes, so we ended up in the re-entry line. Which was ironically longer than the line to get stamps. As we were in line, there were a lot of people coming out telling us not to go in because it was awful in there and that the club sucked. I guess they didn't like moshing either. 

4. I was SOBER. :( sad face. And, I didn't get to dance as much as I would have liked. :( Double sad face. 

So, the cons were in a weird order I guess. Overall though, it was a good experience. It was a friend's 21st where she got royally fucked up (she wore a happy birthday crown, so she really was royalty), fell down the dancing platform, threw up at one of the VIP tables, and got escorted by security. WHOOO Vegas! Code for drunk bitches is apparently a 603. The bouncers were REALLY nice and helpful. 

Marquee is still awesome to go to. One of the biggest pros I think are the bathroom. There isn't ever too long of a line bc there are a lot of stalls.

Gone are the days of clubbers being happy, polite, and all with the same great energy. Forget about being able to sit, relax, and cool down when you have danced it up on a spacious well-designed dance floor without being smashed and squeezed to the point of suffocation. 
The stairwell walk is grueling in heels and then not having a cool place to rest inside the facility? Incredibly inconsiderate of the designers.

It has a very simple layout that even the most drunk can find their way out (ex. that time I lost half my bachelorette parrty). Bathrooms are pretty. 

Elevators take you up to the club. Once you're ready to leave, the bouncers will not let you take the elevators down. All of us had to walk down 4-5 flights of stairs in heels. Why would you make your guests do this especially at the end of the night?

This club has three levels all accessed by means of stairs, pre-warning to the ladies with their given footwear. Added tip: Ladies you can buy flip flops in the bathroom for $10 bucks . The club has elevators but they were an aggravation factor in the sense they are not available for public use til sometime after midnight per a security guards answer (though and my reasoning for taking a star I never saw them run and was there til way beyond midnight). 

The second accessed floor is the Main Room. By 11pm expect pure madness on this level, the crowds have arrived is an understatement. Markus Schulz was bringing the house\/trance fusion to this level the night I attended. It was crazy inside with people just standing on the DANCE floor trying to watch and then the people actually dancing, hey what a concept, ha sorry sarcasm got the best of me. The interior dance floor next to the main setup is rather small so having human pillars on the floor was a whole new challenge. This floor is probably most notable for the outside area. Pools lit up, alcohol all around, music bumping, plenty of bars, gambling, and great view of the strip. 

The top floor, if your feet aren't already killing you, I'm telling you ladies be warned or pray to the elevator gods they are running all night, or pick up some awesome sandals  - Library room. Is extremely small very limited. I didn't stay here long enough to even pay attention to the music, though I admit I loved the theme of the room, felt like I should have been in a red robe Hugh Hefner style with a stogie.

I know this, because I'm still looking. :) HOWEVER, it definitely is going to be more hip hop than what is playing in the main room. 

So - I'm sure by now that you've read that the nightclub space is tiny. You know what I've gathered after my club ventures here in Vegas? For some ridiculous reason, they're ALL going to be tiny inside. The best times to go are during the spring & summer when you can move freely between outdoors and indoors.

Speaking of spring & summer... going to Marquee Dayclub for a DJ event? Fantastic! It will be packed, but you will have fun! You can pretty much move around as you please - minus the cabanas with their own pools (yes, those are a thing here!)

Probably would cost you a minimum drink purchase and whatever the heck chair rentals are going these days.

We got inside and were immediately impressed with the setup and decided to walk around a bit before we got a drink.  Everything was really cool.  We stepped out to the outside bar and all lined up waiting for a drink.  There were two women bartenders working and there wasn't a line, however, we were ignored for a good 10 minutes with not even an acknowledgement we were there.  Then, the bartender on our side actually left and a new one took over, all while we were standing there.   Finally the new girl came over and got our drink order.  I asked for a Red Bull and vodka and did not specify vodka.  She tells me it's $19!  What's funny is there were a couple other girls that ordered the same drink and there drinks were a couple dollars cheaper.  She wasn't friendly and obviously overcharged when she felt like it.

Needless to say after that, we were kind of over it.  We found a cozy little room with some couches and pool tables with the kind of music we liked and danced a little, then a bouncer guy said we were in the way so we moved to another area and danced.  Again, we were pushed away saying we were in the way.  We figured out that unless we were buying bottle service, we needed to get out of there.  We then found the stairs everyone keeps referring to.  Crazy amount of stairs.  Finally got to the bumping hip hop music room.  It was jam packed with drunk girls that kept bumping into us so we finally decided to call it.

Now Marquee seemed to have that idea in mind, having two floors, one really fucking small area for hip hop, and a visually stunning second floor that plays house music and opens up to the pool area. The pool area is a nice addition to the club, and it offers a good place to sit and talk to others and for people like me to cool off from the dance floor. The first floor is almost literally packed all the time, but the DJ's they have here are on point with the music. It hits hard and isn't awkward enough to throw in random periods of house music like XS does. There's a little side area on the first floor that lets you over look the strip, and seems to be kinda like an area for smokers to mingle.

I've actually been here twice, once in February when it was barely open and they had people go through a bunch of stairwells to get to where you wanted to go, and most recently last Thursday, when only the first floor was open.

Key tip from this review:  Purchase tickets to whoever the DJ is online through Marquee's website, then make sure to pick them up before 8pm, then you can get in a much shorter line and wait only 10-15 minutes to get in, rather than the 3 hour line.  Plus, it's 30-40 dollars for these tickets which includes the cover, so no need to grease the bouncer when you go in.

Good:

Sound system is AWESOME, and the DJ has a pretty sweet vantage point above the dance floor.  There are also plenty of bars which is a plus, but drinks will be their normal expensive self at about 40 bucks for a round of 3 drinks.  Access to outside is very easy and very big with additional bars.  I think the dayclub will be a fun time as all the pesonal suites have individual hot tubs.

Bad:
Layout is terrible for the most part.  The bathroom is literally down some random corridor and is difficult to find.  I only found this one bathroom so I don't know if there are even more.  It is large, but still, you need more spread out.   Crowd-we showed up at 10:15PM and it already was packed and the ratio was terrible.  Plus, there were a curious number of obese people there which I was suprised about given all the comments about the beautiful people.  I just expected more, as in the times of body english where if you paid for bottle service, the ratio would be off the hook for at least an hour and a half.  I think people get here at 9pm since there's so much hype about this place.  

Bottle service- If you are considering this, I strongly discourage you.  The quote I received was $1500 and that's for a table outside with a 3 bottle minimum.  They are really milking the hype here and it's ridiculous.  In addition, outside really is a terrible location, maybe in the summer it'll get more traction, but for right now, really no one is out there unless you are getting bottle service.  If you want a table by the dance floor, it's a 8-10K minimum, and I'm not even joking.  I'd go for the DJ tickets online as for now, it's the surest thing.

Getting in:
Plan ahead. figure out your vegas hookup and utilize. I wish i could be more helpful here but we were a bachelorette party one night and i dont know how the guys we met the other night got us in (greased the door? it was past midnight?). Anyways, have a plan. We arrived by 10 and though it was a little slow inside it's worth it to come early to make the process super smooth. escorted in, and the best part was our elevator ride. The man, holding the door open was bouncing with a little head nod singing ""to the back of the elevata.. to the back of the elevata"" and as the doors closed he changed to ""it's a party in the elevata.. party in the elevata"".. then he gives us the run-down of the club and as the doors open he closes with ""ya gotta dance of the elevata.. dance off the elevata"".. yes you had to be there, but it's worth describing one of my favorite moments of Vegas: in a dimly lit elevator laughing and dancing  with the Marquee guy. 

Atmosphere:
Huge. (that's what she said). We tried exploring the whole place but with all the up and down unmarked stairwells we quickly got disinterested and went back to the main floor w\/ an indoor dance floor and outdoor pool-side lounge area. It's a little warm outside for my taste but my friends who get cold easily loved it so i just knocked back a few ice-cold jack and cokes and strolled around the pool w\/ them. Point being: there's something for everyone here. 

Crowd:
Crowd is what you make of it. All the girls i've met here are super fun and nice and sweet (I mean, most of them are w\/ a bachelorette party and celebrating something fun so you'd hope they'd be friendly). My friends would tell you if there's a fight to be found at a club, i'll find it (no, i've never actually fought anyone. i just put my foot in my mouth a lot) anyways. no catty ladies here. Women will take photos of you w\/ your friends and then tell you you look great (be sure to reciprocate!!)  Guys range. from fun and utterly charming to self-absorbed, d-bag reminders that chivalry is dead. 

Stating the obvious:
 Dancing on the designated dance floor at Vegas clubs is pointless unless you like a bumper-car version of dancing.. 
Drinks are not cheap. either find the guys w\/ bottle service that WANT to share, or pony up at the bar and enjoy the atmosphere that comes with your beverage.
Every bachelorette and her mom is here on a saturday night.

I wasn't into the music, mainly because I was told it was going to be hip hop (and the fact that that was my 3rd straight night partying to house music, I wanted something else). My situation aside, the music was actually not that bad.

My only concern was the fact that I had to climb what it seemed like 400 flights of stairs - past the escalators, we had to go up a few more flights, which lead outside (because we had G-List), then once we were lined up outside, we had to climb more flights before we actually got in. This stairs situation ain't good if there's drunk people trying to get home, which I'm sure they have on a regular basis.

Absolutely great crowd. Also love the view out by the pool\/cabana area. The lay out was great too, and I like it better than XS' lay out.

After knowing how much time the crowd waited in line to get into this nightclub, I think everyone had that mindset ""What ever happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.""

This place by far, has the most social-able, friendly, go-getter crowd I have ever experienced in comparison to other lively nightclubs. (It might of been just this night)

Maybe the outdoor scenery with plenty of cabana seatings or the unique large lamp shaped heaters around the breezy opened area or the (Thunder Women) show above the dance floor, made an influence to the crowds attitude... Haha, but with every nightclub, there are some down points to mention...

For instance, this club was said to be one of the biggest clubs, maybe cause of the extended walking paths to the restrooms, dance floor, entrance to the club made this place seem wide and bigger. I say, that was my down fall of this club! 

Waiting in a 2 hour line around the edges of Marquee, soon to enter another line into the elevators heading above into the club, first seeing a bar and deciding which path to take (outdoor, indoor) then asking for directions to the restroom, walking a mile back into the small dance floor... Is just too overwhelming to imagine. Right? (I felt sorry for the ladies)

Overall experience:
_Must at least come once for the experience
_Be prepared for getting around the area with its long walk-ways
_Need to enjoy the whack ecstasy music 
_Enjoy the unforgettable outdoor area
_Get ready to mingle since this place isn't really happening...

Its where the wooden area is with orange couches and a jacuzzi in front. The minimum that night started at $3k but we ended up having to spend over $3.5k (not including 38% gratuity) to get where we wanted. Paul Van Dyke was a special guest DJ and he got the place jumpin. The waitresses and drink pourers were very cute and didn't beg for tips like other places. One thing i noticed compared to getting a table at surrender though was that we didn't have our own security. One complaint I had was at around 1am, I left with my lady to go dance to PVD and when I returned, the table was empty. I guess a couple of my buddies partied a little too hard and got kicked out. However, since the table was under my name I don't understand why I was not notified before they cleared the table. They even took all the girls' cameras and guys' coats to the lost and found.

First and foremost, the set-up of this place is close to disastrous, especially for a dance fiend like myself. There is not enough room anywhere to comfortably sprawl out and get down without a) bumping into someone, b) having someone bump into you, spilling your $18 drink, c) being approached every 3 minutes or d) scraping your knee on someone's table. I understand that, by nature, nightclubs are hookup hot spots, but for some reason, Marquee seems to be THE place to get picked up. Nice if that's your goal. For me, it is not. Each time I've gone, I've spent my entire evening trying to elbow my way to some sort of serene dance space, only to be knocked off my heels by some intruder, accidental or not. Major star loss for this. 

Second, bartenders just assume you want top-shelf liquor, so they only offer ""Grey Goose or Ketel One."" Nice job up-selling, but it doesn't sit well with me after having to dish out $30+ (for two drinks) each time. Take it easy, yeah? 

The music is alright, definitely not something to write home about. I've said this before and I'll say it again: if you want a headliner on any given weekend, head to XS (hands down, my absolute favorite). Unless I were given a free table or something, I don't think I'd ever yearn for this place... Maybe I'm just getting old?",7,4,3

Nightclub: I still think Marquee is an awesome club.  I love the fact that they have multiple rooms with different music, and I also love the outdoor pool area.  It's like a mix of the best of XS and Tao.  Cons are still the same: hip-hop room is too crowded & too many stairs.  Lately, they've been hosting a lot of big house DJs, which is fine - though it does push up prices for the fellas.  If I were to get table service, I would probably do it either in the hip-hop room (for the music), or outside in the cabanas (for the view of the strip - wow!).

My main gripe about the nightclub is line security - not always very polite.  Also, I wouldn't try to go to Marquee unless I were in a group of ALL girls or I had table service.  Because Marquee is so popular right now, the mixed group line is utterly ridiculous & the club is not SO amazing that it's worth waiting over half an hour for.  Plus you can't drink in line - not even drinks from the Cosmopolitan!  Marquee is pretty great, but there are other great clubs in Vegas too.  If you get there late and have to wait in the general admission \/ guest list line (even with comp passes) and if you can see the big shoe statues...dude, just save yourself the trouble and try a different club.

My recommendation is either:
1) Go with a group of all girls and enter from the ""all-girls line"" (upstairs)... or try to talk your way in with a host, whichever works
2) Book a table or cabana
3) If you must go with a mixed group, get there no later than 10pm.  Real talk.

Dayclub: Not worth it unless you have a cabana.  They usually have house DJs, so the music is OK for the most part.  The pool is decently sized, but it's too crowded to enjoy unless you have your own place to sit.  Also watch out for your stuff; my friend's wallet got lifted at the dayclub & the staff were pretty useless in helping us find it.",5,4,3

I've been to this club several times and always had a great experience, but this last weekend I had an unbelievable time! From the moment we arrived at the cosmo til the moment we left we were treated like royalty.

We arrived around ten and entered through the third floor VIP enterence. We planned on going in early to get stamped and head over to Haze for the open bar until Marquee started filling up. Once we got inside there was no need for this plan. there were 12 of us so we weren't sure if we'd be able to score a table but we were wrong! Within minutes a group of guys invited us over and the night took off from there. The table was located perfectly in the center of the club with a perfect view of the Dj. The ladies were on top of it with the bottle service. We danced on the tables all night and the staff even encouraged it.

The first Dj (didn't catch his name) played a hybrid of top 40 and house music and really had the crowd going. Around 1am porter robinson took the stage and blew us all away. He rocked marquee with his energy..at least once or two per song the blowers and confetti went off. The light show was amazing.

 Everything about this night was perfect. Even the bathrooms! When it was finally time to leave we were escorted into an elevator by the friendly staff and wished a good night.

What you don't expect, however, is to be completely disrespected by an unreasonable and illogical security team. So thank you, Marquee, for adding that bit of color to our weekend.

We (8 girls) arrived at the door at ~11 PM on a Saturday. The bouncer thought my friend's CA driver's license was fake (lol it wasn't), so he called over the head of security, Tommy. It was annoying, yes, but we understood that no club wants to accidentally let in a 12 year old so it was fine.

The issue was that, our boy Tommy was completely and unnecessarily rude and stubborn in questioning my friend. Her signature and all of her answers matched what was on the ID (because! it! was! her! ID!!??), but Tommy refused to believed her. He said the girl in the photo wasn't my friend, which was just ridiculous. She looked just like she did in the photo, and even if she didn't, hasn't he been in Vegas long enough to understand the power of make-up??

Our conversation with Tommy only went downhill from there, as he just REFUSED to look through her social media to verify her identity--something that every other club does regularly. ""It's not her,"" he said, as he stared straight at the exact same girl as the one on the ID -.-

Then I guess he decided he was done with us, since he turned and walked away as we were mid-sentence in explaining ourselves. 

When we gave up and headed over to Surrender, the bouncer there was confused when we told him what had happened: ""But....It is you....?""

The first time I went to Marquee Nightclub, I was not impressed. I heard a lot of hype as it was the newest club at the time, so I had a lot of expectations. I remember naming my photo album, 'stairmaster night.' What the hell was up with the bazillion stairs and lack of access to elevators?! My feet hurt so bad and I felt sick from the drinks, I found myself wanting to leave by 1230A. The second time I went, things didn't improve much. I was used to the stairs, but made the mistake of trying to meet a friend. The different levels and multiple bars were so confusing and everything was so crowded it was impossible to find people.

It wasn't until my third visit that my opinion changed. I made a point to go to Marquee the night Roger Sanchez was spinning and I had an amazing time. Granted, I didn't use the stairs as much and mostly stayed on the main floor with access to the pool outside, so maybe that impacted my experience. But this time I was able to appreciate the large space of the dancefloor and beautiful environment of the outside landscape. It has amazing lighting and plentiful tables and cabanas as well...a girl's best friend :P And maybe it's just me, but due to the difficulty and high demand of getting in, I feel like it filters out a lot of creeps. I've had few encounters with weird or gross guys at Marquee, which is such a nice relief. 

So overall, even though I had a bad first impression, I'm always open to second and even third chances, and Marquee definitely won me over. I can't wait for my next visit!!",1,2,1

I went here with a group of 7 girls, got on the guestlist for the day club through a promoter, which are more than happy to help you get in everywhere for free if you have a larger group.  We were a last minute add, so when we got there they didnt see my name on the guestlist, but I patiently came up to one of the security guys and explained my situation, and got in no problem. They are super accommodating for the most part. They were sold out of day beds unfortunately, but we made our way to the bar which sprays an ongoing mist of water because it was 107 degrees, and that mist made the weather bearable.  bartenders were great, people were happy, pool was big and not super packed.   Music was amazeballs, if you're into house and electro.  I would come here again and again and again.",1,0,0

We arrived at 9 PM to stand in line because the promoter told us to get there at this time. We all know that is early as hell to go out in Vegas, but when places are crowded you have to get there early. Fine. 

We were told to stand in the guest list line, so that's exactly what we did. We were told they would start letting people in at 9:30. We were really not that far back in the line, maybe about 80 people deep, then suddenly about 10 PM one of the bouncers tells us we have to go upstairs to a different entrance and takes a ton of people in the line upstairs by the pool. He said we would be in quicker up there at that entrance. 

We get up there and stand in line by the pool. There are herds of Asians up there trying to cut ahead in the line, both girls and guys, and the set up was just godawful. These Asian chicks cut ahead and the one bouncer told them to leave, but of course they pretended not to speak English and kept shoving through the crowd. 

This line upstairs was absolutely ridiculous. No way in hell was it faster than the downstairs line. We stood in line for over THREE HOURS. My friend sat down on one of the chairs up there by the pool for about 30 seconds and was yelled at by a bouncer to get off the furniture because it's not there to be sat on. Ummm...really? A chair that is at a pool which is NOT EVEN OPEN can't be sat on for less than  minute after we have been standing for three hours? 

Meanwhile, more Asians are cutting the line and the bouncer again tells more Asian chicks to come back and get at the and of the line. They keep shoving past everyone, bouncer just says whatever and turns back around and yells at some guy for leaning on the pole that holds up the ropes and says it's not there for people to touch. Really? Maybe they hate white people at this club? 

Oh and then of course some Asian girls again are cutting in the line and one removed the rope from this pole and leaves it open and hoards of ppl try to shove through. I thought that was not for anyone to touch, much less to REMOVE and walk right through. Guess what Asian girls, everyone else has been waiting, so you should too. What makes you think you can jump ahead of everyone else in line? You are certainly not better looking than ANY OF US, that is for sure. 


The lines up there barely even moved at all the entire time. Perhaps this was due to the fact that the Asians kept cutting the line shoving past everyone else. Half my group decided at that point to just leave and go elsewhere because this was so ridiculous and stupid after we had been waiting this long and the disorganization of the lines and the idiot Asian girls cutting ahead, etc. 

We finally get up to the point of entering the club and lo and behold there is nowhere to move inside. Took 20 mins to get to the bar, was yelled at by a bouncer for attempting to go near the dance floor (WTF?!?!) and then could not even get any drinks ordered in there. 

The girls and I ended up leaving and going somewhere else to meet the rest of our group who were smarter and bailed out over an hour prior. They were having a great time elsewhere with no issues like this. F Marquee and its lame ass setup and completely disorganized methods. I am happy to stick with XS, Tryst, and Tao as I have never had a bad time at any of those places and have not dealt with such disorganization and stupidity.",2,3,0

During the day, we also went to the dayclub with free admission--but there wasn't really anything going on that day.  If you don't want to pay for day beds\/cabanas, the only space you can really sit and hang out is the bar area of marquee which wasn't so bad.  It was nice to hang out in the shade, definitely got our drink on since we were confined to the bar.  

Order the Frozen Red Bulls, they were so refreshing and definitely made me more energized.    They also have a lot of other signature cocktails that are really delicious--I don't think you can go wrong ordering any of them.  

Marquee nightclub itself was a letdown.  The ratio of guys to girls that night was surprising.  Usually there's tons of girls but this time it was the other way around...it could have been that it was a monday night but who knows since it was my first time there.

The outdoor area was probably more preferable to me than the inside.  It was really crowded inside and the music in the main area was decent but I have to say their light shows were pretty great.  

As we were walking around, we did find another area inside.  It was a small room which looked more like a library that also had a bar.  I don't know how many other hidden rooms they had...It was pretty dark in there and difficult to navigate my way around there.  

Overall, I'd have to say that I wasn't too impressed with Marquee.  The decor is really upscale and chic but I don't think I enjoyed the layout, crowd, and music as much as I had hoped.  I don't think it's worth it to wait in a long line and pay an arm and a leg for this place.  I think I'd only be back as a hotel guest to bypass the hassle.  I have to say that Surrender is a lot better than Marquee.",4,0,0

-- Plenty of outdoor space to smoke, relax, converse.

-- Buy a PRESALE TICKET before you get to Vegas. I guarantee you'll have a much easier time getting in-- only catch is, you HAVE to go to Marquee. Can't change your mind and decide to go somewhere else once you get out there.

There's nothing like this on the east coast, not even close. As one friend put it, when you're out on the terrace under the breezy canopies and lounge areas, you'll feel like you're in St. Tropez, not Vegas. The view from this place is also unbelievable.

I think my girls and I came here on the most perfect day (weather wise). The breeze was so incredibly dreamy and calming. Our group was asked to come inside and sit at one of the tables, and everything was comped - including all drinks. Staff will single you out for sure, so come dressed to impress. Don't you just love that about Vegas? ;D

Although we came during Memorial Day weekend, we had no problems getting in due to the fact that we had pre-sale tickets, and also because we went early (REALLY early). This place gets insane later in the night, so definitely come early - especially if you're rocking those 5 inch heels. You're feet will thank you later on, speaking of which - they sell flip flops in the bathroom which we all got, and they ended up completely saving us later in the night when our feet were dying.

Okay I exaggerated!  But seriously, we had to wait at least 3 hours to get in because we didn't wait early enough (8 girls and 2 guys by the way). The bouncers wouldn't let us squat in line either! By the time we got in at 1:00am, our feet were in too much pain from standing to even dance. What a waste of three hours! We could have gone to a strip club instead!!!

But wait, there's another way to avoid long lines: table! A group I knew who went there while ATB was playing spent $2500 on bottle service. But they got a free night at the Cosmopolitan! 

Alright that's not the reason why I gave it three stars. I mean you'd think that getting on the ""guest list"" means something, but no, you'll quickly realize that the guest list line is not any better. Maybe it's because Ferry Corsten was playing that night. Anyway, where is the guest list line exactly? Is it the guest list line that you don't have to pay for? Or is it the one you pay for to get in sooner but not as soon as you think? OR is it one of the multiple lines that gets combined together when it's passed 11:00pm when that guest list is closed so now all the lines are now general admission? YES!!! LINE UP EARLY PEOPLE OR SUFFER! (Unless you know a VIP host!) 

Anyway, the interior is so cool especially with the giant LED screen that cost $5 million, but the place is actually quite small compared to sister club TAO. You will suffocate from lack of oxygen, so make sure you go outside to catch a breather. Now... the route to exit is not so cool and not so high heel or drunk people friendly. Listen to the ladies here! We know best!!

By the way, the service at Marquee stinks. Try not to get lost from your group.

Marquee was SUPER crackin on saturday night. Maybe it was because it was the I-heart-Radio weekend but im pretty sure this club is always crackin. 

After the long wait in line (swag status if you have bottle service) you take an elevator to get into the club. Its basically as good as it gets in Marquee. There are 3 floors to explore, all unique. The floor that you get off on is the main floor which they play electro, techno, and dubstep music. The upper floor is called the ""Library"" and when i went up there, they were playing some nice oldies mixes. Theres an outside part to the club which is REALLY nice. There are tables for gambling and the Dealers were women. The bottom floor is the hip hop room and that room was  CRAZY. Girls were hot. The room was hot and crowded. Go Go dancers were hot. EVERYTHING was hot. 

Advice if you're planning on going here:

- GUEST LIST GUEST LIST GUEST LIST. guys, you dont want to pay 90$ for cover charge. Girls get in for free. go figure.
- PREGAME. well this is a given for any club you go to. Drink a little before coming here cause the drinks are pricey, as in any Vegas Club. But if you're ballin and you have no problem buying rounds of drinks then go ahead.
- if you're a guy, GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS. Make sure your Guy to Girl Ratio is GOOD. if not, then you'll probably have to wait or not even get into the club. Ive seen a group of 5 guys not get in because their ratio sucked.

Just make sure to not have any worries, dont worry about how you're getting back to the hotel, dont worry about your problems back home, just DONT WORRY and you'll have an amazing time here. Its vegas. Whatever happens in Vegas stays. Or ends up on Youtube. 

PS: and if you do happen to wake up someplace thats not your hotel room, then congrats. Cause thats what i did. haha. Cheers!",5,5,4

The hottest clubs for 2011 in one of the upper tier hotel at the Strip. Go in, get VIP bottle service, get the girls, dance your ass off, tip them well and they treat you well, and you have the night of your life right? No. I couldn't be more wrong with my initial perception of this god forsaken place where even satin himself will be embarrassed to take a diarrhea dump in this shit hole. And you wanna know why? Well.... where do we begin...

So we went and ordered bottle vip service. Total cost of the drinks + tax + tips on the bill totaled to digits that's easily longer than a black guy's cock. We gave an additional $100 to the ""host"" (let's call him asshole) for showing us to our table. Oh wow he really worked for that huh? $100 in the 2 minutes he spent on walking us to our tables. Untaxed, undocumented, unreported. You know what that sounds like? Illegal immigrants. 

Never trust the waitresses or the waiters. Actually, this applies to all of these nightclubs in Vegas. The waitress will pour the shit out of the alcohol for you, then as soon as you put your cup down, the waiter will immediately swoop in and ""clean"" your cups. Each time they clean my shit, it costs us around $40 worth of alcohol that we didn't finish. Even if we put a napkin on top of it, they still take it. This ""cleaning service"" is more expensive than getting an Asian massage, I swear the god. So I say ""No, I'll pour it myself."" She gives me a dirty look. I don't give a fuck bitch, GTFO. Gave you your $400 tip, leave me the fuck alone. 

Never trust the bouncers. They're fucked up, they're bitches, whatever you can think of when you talk shit, that's what they are. The host (asshole) too. I'll talk more about Mr. Asshole in a bit. But first, my girl needed to bring someone back in. I asked them if I can get them, they said yes, as long as I tell them I'm from table ##. Fine, I got to the exit with the girl, another bouncer said ""once you go out, you cant get back in."" I told him I'm from table ## and showed him the VIP stamp, he said ""i still aint going to let you in."" I asked him if there's any secret code word he wants, he said ""my birthday's july 17th."" Ok, I take that as a sign, the girl and I go and get her friend. Walking back, he denied us. Wtf. I said ""July 17th."" He responded with ""I dont know what you're talking about."" Are you fucking serious? So the girl tells me to go stand at the re-entry line to hold the spot while she tries to talk to the bouncer. I turn to go, right when I turn, he lets the two bitches in. And they just went in without looking back. WOW. BITCHES man. I said wtf, he tells me to go to 2nd floor table service line. So I go there, and I see the host, Mr. Asshole. I said to him, ""You recognize me, I tipped you $100, can you get me back in?"" He looks at me, and says ""Ok, hang on, let me get the other bouncer to let you in."" Disappears, never comes back. Wow again. 

I get a text from a friend. He got kicked out. Why? Because some girl fell or something and when he tried to pick her up, she said he groped her? Wtf? The bouncer didn't even let him talk, he just listened to the girl, then permanent X on his wrist. Kicked out just like that. What. the. fuck. 

After 1 hour, I was eventually let back in by another bouncer. I see the July 17th bitch. Confronted him, he said ""i dont even wanna talk to you."" Ok fine, yes you got the ""power"" now, wait 5 more years, your dumbass be begging for change. Whatever. So I go back up. Wow, the elevators are closed out. We gotta use these in-case-of-emergency-fire staircase. Plain metal staircase, going up 3-5 flights. Did I mention this club is 3 floors big? Nice architect right? Poor girls with their overly high heels. I swear these heels are longer than Beiber's dick. Anyways, I have no idea how much cover charge is, but I personally paid ~$600 not including tips and tax for this shit.. this metal staircase. Luxury for the win. 

All in all, the bouncers, the waitresses, the host are all lying pricks at this place. Sure the first girl was a bitch too. Would I consider coming back? I'd rather go into a Chinese toilet with old Chinese men taking a shit and smoking at the same time. I'd rather yank all the hair off my balls. I'd rather masturbate while being forced to watch two girls one cup. Better yet, I'd rather fantasize myself being part of two guys one horse.",4,10,0

My friend and I got in free because we got hookups with a promoter. They also had some special deal that night for free drinks for girls from 10-11pm - not sure how often they have this? It was the first and only time I'd gone to Marquee.

I really like how they have multiple floors with different ambiances and music. We stayed on the main dancefloor the majority of the time. It was a lot of fun and the music was really good. The only downside was that sometimes I felt like I couldn't handle the intense strobelights hahaha I literally had to stop dancing for a few instances because the lights were so crazy.

Of course, this has to do with a lot more than just the nightclub itself - a number of drinks, great company, and connections that allowed for the skipping of the massive line were all pretty hefty contributions - but Marquee had just the right vibe and space.
Kudos to whoever designed the outdoor space: not only is it a pleasure to dance with a view of the surrounding hotels off of the terrace, but the lighting and layout is very well done. One can have a great time chilling in the Cabanas, and the table service seemed very efficient (and sexy). It was a friend's birthday, and the cupcakes provided by the club were delicious. Also, the music is just loud enough outside!

Compared to the XS, which I went to the night before, the crowd was younger, more beautiful, and trendier. Of course this has a lot to do with the newness of the Cosmopolitan, the gorgeous bubblegum-esque interior decor, and that Kaskade was spinning. However it seemed like the entire hotel was designed with ""young, trendy, and electronic"" in mind. 
When Kaskade came on, my friend and I made our way to the dance floor, partying with everyone we came across along the way. 
The experience was absolutely surreal: the lights, KASKADE, the super-coordinated ballerinas dancing above him, and the fantastic music. If you need a breather, just go outside!

My first experiences with Vegas were lukewarm. ""What happens in Vegas..."" ""Go big or go home..."" Please. None of the sayings fit. I just went back home with empty pockets and regrets...and none of the good ones either.

Then the Cosmopolitan was built. I saw the beginnings of it 2 years ago, the rough skeleton and a beacon of hope. Now it's built and completely trumps (pun intended) any other hotel\/casino venue in Vegas. It's classy, clean and just plain epic.

So Marquee. First time I went was just after it opened to the general public. We had a hook up of sorts but STILL were advised to get there before 9:30. No big deal. We had a great crew and so brought the party with us to the line. I got to peeping out the scene. The clientele: young, good-looking & dressed correct. Fellas, there are plenty of dimes here, and I'm talking on a NYC\/LA scale not a bright-eyed farmboy scale...no offense. 

The hour flew by and soon enough, after a 20 dollar cover fee for the guys, we were in. The atmosphere is just what I look for in a club. The place is huge, diverse and full of energy. Marquee consists of 3 floors. From the perspective of the 2nd floor entrance, the ""1st floor"" is a dance floor with bars surrounding it. There's also an outdoor pool\/bar area which was packed enough when the weather was still ""cold."" This is the main event of this club and every weekend different artists come and perform live. The only downside is that the music is house.

Go down one flight and you're in the hip hop room. People have said it's top 40 but I've heard a lot of old school East Coast rap, too. It does get cramped down here after 1030ish but everyone dances and the energy is great. Go up to the main floor and then up again and you're in the Library, a classy lounge area with pool tables and a bar. The second time I went, we were in by 9 (yeah, we got out early) and since the reserved tables were still unoccupied, me and my friends just posted up there. Great vibe.

As a hip hop head, it's strange that I'm giving a club that doesn't center around hip hop the highest rating, but at the end of the day, a club is more than just the music that's played inside of it. At its best, a club is the kind of place where you get lost and time just stands still.

We opted for the pool party on a Saturday afternoon, so we donned our suits, which we knew wouldn't get wet and headed on over the Marquee.
Thankfully I have a friend who got us on the VIP list so we didn't need to stand in line, but instead were ushered right to the elevator to the roof deck after checking in. Boy did we feel fancy and hip! Upon arrival to the roof deck, we were ushered past another check in at the bottom of the stairs and then again at the top. Good thing as I wouldn't have stayed in line too long and would have backed out for sure, I'm actually not sure how you young-ins do it to be honest with you.
The pool area is really nice, the cabana's that surround it are really cool, especially those with the glass front hot tubs. I'm not that baller though so we just camped out by the bar and took in the sights while enjoying a few drinks. They're pricey here, my beer was 10 dollars and wifeys red wine was 13. Truthfully, I don't think anyone here is worrying about how much they're spending though.
The pool was really funny as everyone was so packed in you couldn't even move, but everyone seemed to enjoy it a lot and was in full on party mode. One thing I found odd was that people were ordering plates of food and they were sitting poolside in the sun which was a little gross to me.
DJ Scotty played that day and did a great job of getting the crowd going, the music was fantastic and had me bobbing up and down to the beat.
They also had Blackjack tables with a 50 dollar minimum if you felt the need to gamble a little.
All in all, I had a great time. I half expected to feel really out of place being 40 and everyone else is basically half my age. That wasn't the case, everyone was just having a good time, myself and my wife included. I also expected the bartenders to give me the brush off or make me wait since I'm not one of the beautiful people, but our bartender was attentive and fast to pop me a new beer when I needed one.
Next time I'm in Vegas I will be coming back to checkout the nightclub.",1,0,0

Staying at the Cosmo with a couple of friends, we decided to drop by Marquee early to get our free admission stamp (compliments of being a hotel guest) so we wouldn't have to wait in those long lines. For the most part, we all got in for free, expect for one of my friends because they said his ID wasn't him. My friend normally wears glasses where as his ID had no glasses. The security guard still wouldn't let him in, even though it was legally his license. It was pretty messed up because the guy didn't even backlight it or ask a fellow guard to compare. It's Vegas and sometimes those security rules hit hard (especially for the guys). My short rant is this: I know security has to be tough and all (while they play favorites), but does it really hurt to double check IDs? 

After getting our stamps, we hopped out of line to devise a new plan. We were celebrating a birthday, so we wouldn't let a bump in the road ruin our night. Eventually some of us went back in, while others parted ways to another club.

Upon re-entry, which is located on a different level, were a flight of endless stairs. As we walked up these fire exit stairwells, we would see people going in and out. This is the part that doesn't feel like a club because you're walking under fluorescent light bulbs with fine young ladies, who are all dressed to impress, and it looks like they're walking though a warehouse. Maybe they should find another way to let people back in, instead of using the fire exits.

We entered what I think was the 2nd floor. The lighting of the room was red. It was super hot because the room was tiny! Way too many people on this floor were sweaty and too close for my comfort. This floor was horrible.

We ventured to the top floor. MUCH BETTER. It's more open with half of the club being inside, while the other half is outside. The top floor is the best by far! Skip all the other levels, this is the best part of the club.

The inside dance floor will get the most crowded because of the stage and the video screen. The areas around it, which circle the dance floor, have a lot of bottle service tables. The front and back bars have a nice area to hang around and chill.

The outside area was my favorite though because of the open space, the cabanas and the pool that featured girls as mermaids swimming around. They literally had a fin-piece suit for their legs. To get out they had to be carted off. The outside also features it's own DJ with their own video screen, two bars, a corner to gamble and what seems to be a lot more friendly people since you're not all jammed up in the corner with one another.

Overall this was a good Vegas nightclub, but I have to minus points for the security and layout. The music was good and I liked the crowd. I had a lot of fun. It's the people you go with and the fun ones you encounter that make it more memorable.",2,1,0

The crowd sunday for martin solveig and benny benassi was spectacular.  Walking on to the dancefloor during solveig's set and I was greeted by a crowd of people wearing silly tennis headbands from the ""hello"" video he tossed into the crowd.........hilarious.   Very fun crowd, people there to have a good time.

Saturday Kaskade played a great set, similar nice crowd, people who actually like house music and knew the DJ.  Everyone having fun, great vibe.

Friday Avicii was totally different, he is a spectacular producer, but he is an average DJ.  His playlist was pretty much the last ministry of sound annual CD.  Also the people that show up to see Avicii is a totally different crowd.  Frat boys, jerk offs, people unfamiliar with house music.  People were shoving each other and being dicks.

Only real complaint about the weekend is it's kind of retarded how Marquee tries to re-create the line to get inside the club, all over the nightclub.  If you thought getting into the club was a pain in the ass, wait till you try and go onto the dancefloor, out on the patio, or back in the club from the pool.

They station bouncers at all these places and refuse to let people pass, while VIPs walk right past you.  So you get to wait in line ALL NIGHT, just moving around the club.  It's kind of like TAO where everywhere you stand is a walkway you're not allowed to stay on.

Service was great other than that.  Great DJs, dancers, bartenders, and the bouncers were as nice as they could be.  

I am getting really tired of feeling like cattle at these big vegas clubs, I think I am going to check out Drai's again soon. Any suggestions for better clubs are appreciated.",2,1,1

Sorry guys, you are on your own. Inside the club is dark and has lots of open space. The outside area I like better. There are spas and pools and tree boxes that you can sit on. You can also see the strip and it has a pretty view. Much more quite outside, so you can actually sit and talk. I was not too fond of the music they played and not much people were dancing. Getting in and out of the nightclub is kind of a nightmare! To get in- I'm only speaking from experience with my promoter, but we all had to meet downstairs and she only brought girls in as groups- not your personal group, but like a group group. She told people to meet at a certain time, and so whoever was on her list, I think she waited until all or most of them showed up then walked in about 20 or so girls at the same time. I understand that this saves her time, but you don't exactly feel VIP when it's done in that manner either. Every other club that I've had a promoter for, you went in with just the people you came with, not waiting for everyone to gather like cattle. Anyways, we met downstairs and so had to go back upstairs to get in and the entrance was wrapped around the back so I did not really like that being in heels. Also when you leave, oh geesh, talk about the worse stairs ever!! The entrance leads you to the back, like the back outside of a building! It's all metal stairs and endless amounts of them!! Every girl I saw freaked out at the stairs that lead us out and held on the the rails for dear life! Seriously, metal stairs leading to what like an outside back entrance with girls wearing like 4-5 inch heels... that's an accident waiting to happen!! They should at least put grips in the stairs or carpet somewhere so that it's not as accident prone! Just the thought of the exit makes me not want to come back to the club. 

My favorite clubs hands down are XS and Tao. I think I will stick to those!!",2,0,1

At 63,000 square feet with 5 floors, outside patio areas this is the second largest night club in the world! I love how the different floors had different vibes and music. We found the floors that played hip-hop and stuck to those. 

Tip #1: Ladies there is no need for you to stand in line or pay to get into any nightclub in Vegas. Just visit the club during the day to get on the guestlist and arrive early (before 10). My friends and I went to Marquee on a Friday night, was on the list and entered the club through the ladies line located on the 4th floor of the Cosmopolitan.  No wait - you get stamped and can leave and reenter anytime after that.  

Tip #2: Pregame! Drinks at Marquee are $14.",4,0,0

We went through an awesome promoter for the first time and he got us in. We arrived at like 9p. We were at the front of the line on a guest list. Shortly after not even 10 minutes the line got massive so I was happy we got there when we did. It was a bit uncomfortable that security didn't check anyone going in so weapons and who knows what else could have easily been brought inside. The inside is very nice and spacious they had DJ Eric deluxe on the top floor and on the bottom floor in like a hidden corner they have a hip hop room which was pretty nice considering that it was a lot of EDM on the top floor mixed with top 40.

We had a table on the ""patio"" (outside near the pool) and they were very accomidating and nice to the 13 of us girls there for a bachelorette party.  The staff was VERY cool and got us all pumped up when taking us over to the table.  You pay a pretty penny for a table but it's Vegas so it is what it is.

Here is why I give them two stars ... it is what happen AFTER that night.  We paid in cash and the waitress held my ID till we paid.  Well there was a lot of back and forth with the cash and getting it counted correctly, getting our change back, etc.  So after that debacle (I suggest paying with a CC!!) the ID didn't even come to mind (and I hadn't event had a drink yet so I cannot blame it on it the booze).  

The next morning I woke up and was like ohhhh crap, I didn't get my ID back and I had to hop on a plane later that afternoon.  I called the club SEVERAL times - I was given BS answers and ""oh well let us take your information and we will call you back"".  After the FOURTH call I was VERY mad and even though on call #3 I told them the waitress' name I was told ""oh umm the manager has to call each person working that night"".  

I left SEVERAL vm's throughout this week and today finally somebody answered when I called.  ""Oh yes, we have your ID""  Great ... thanks for the call back.  Now I am waiting on some ""liability release form"" ... we shall see if THAT ever comes through.  If it doesn't come through this afternoon I am going to call the Vegas police and report it as stolen.  Seriously ... this is a JOKE.  And for that I will not step into that nightclub again.

I thought that the nightclub was not diverse enough... at least not the time I was there. From waiting in line to being inside the club, I noticed there were many cliques. It's either groups of all Asians, groups of all girls, or groups of all guys. Two. These ""groupies"" were either standing around someone's reserved table, lounging outside the pool area chatting, smoking, and watching people dance, or too many groups of girls were just chilling inside the ladies room for whatever reason. Three. I pass for house music. 

I was there about two weeks ago on a Sunday night. This nightclub deserves three stars because DJ Vice was great.

We were on the guestlist for Marquee so my friend and I rushed to get ready to go to the Cosmopolitan where Marquee is located. Because of this, we didn't have any time to pregame at all. But honestly, with such long lines, even if we did have time, the buzz would have worn off long before we get in. 

So, even though I was told being on the guest list, you skip the line and cover before 11, the guest list line was crazy long. We lucked out because when I went to ask the bouncer how long the wait would be and what not, the party in front of us apparently didn't have an even boy-girl ratio so they asked if we wanted to join them to go in and go our separate ways from there. So we did that. They were hotel guests so their line was a lot shorter than ours but we still had to wait a good hour before getting in and they were each only able to bring in one girl (one of the guys in their party digged out) so I let my friend go in for free and I just paid the $20. 

Once inside, it was super packed so my friend got really annoyed and wanted to leave after 10 minutes. I really want to try visiting Marquee again someday with other friends (a bigger group next time since everyone decided against joining us). 

It's pretty cool though if you don't mind crowds and lines and if you're in the mood for clubbing.  There's 3 floors but the top floor is a little boring. One floor is for house and trance music while the other one plays hip hop. The floor with the house music is where the party's at though.",2,3,1

THE GOOD (3 stars): The club is huge with 3 floors, each housing their own genre of music. It's a beautiful space, without a doubt. There's an inside and outside to cool down when it gets too hot inside, there are great views of the strip outside, and everyone is dressed to the nines because it's a tier-1 club in Vegas. There's world-class talent multiple nights a week spinning here, but if you're not an EDM kind of person, there's also a hip hop floor and top 40. That being said...

THE BAD (2 stars): What kind of idiotic structural designer made a club where girls need to walk up\/down 5 flights of stairs to get in? That part NEVER made sense to me. I love my leg workouts, but hobbling down 5 stories in 5 inch heels after a night of dancing gets... well, it gets fucking annoying. To get from one floor to the other is a massive shitshow when you're drunk, and the layout of the club makes it impossible to find anyone. I found the nightclub to be a nightmare to navigate every single time I've come here. The circular, labyrinth layout makes it easier to find Waldo in a sea of patriotic colors than a damn bathroom to relieve myself in because the club looks the same from every angle (the stairs too, which really doesn't help when you're trying to figure out which floor you're on). And you'd think that, for a club inside the Cosmo and with so much clout and real estate space, they've make a bigger main dancefloor. If you're not on the main dancefloor by 11PM, you're not getting on it for the rest of the night unless you tip the bouncer a 50.

THE OTHER GOOD (that I re-added a star for): SECRET PIZZA. This amazing pizzeria is inside the Cosmo and when you see everyone exiting Marquee and making their way there, follow them! It's got to be the best drunk food I've ever had.

Marquee was one of those clubs I wanted to love because the concept is great (multiple floors, inside\/outside, great DJs, different genres, good-looking crowd, etc.) but couldn't because some designer totally cut out the practical aspect of his work. I can usually only stand being here for an hour or two before heading over to Wynn and Encore to finish my night. Anyways...

DAYCLUB (that got another star): In my opinion, a lot better than the nightclub part of Marquee. There's less people, the heat gets you drunk faster, everyone looks their best in the summer, servers are friendly, and it's not insanely hard to get a drink. I was front and center for Dash Berlin when he played here. I still think Encore Beach club is more fun, but Marquee is definitely among the best dayclubs you can go to in Vegas.",0,2,0

Their layout kind of reminds me of XS Nightclub where they have an indoor dance floor area that opens up to an outdoor pool, patio, and bar area where people can hang out and have a drink. While the patio view doesn't really give you the best view of the Vegas Strip, at least you can still see the towers of the different hotels that make up the MGM City Center. Their indoor key feature is that they have tall, huge screens in the background that emits colorful lights and imagery that goes along with the music. They also have live dancers in front of the screens. You can see the DJ at the front of the dance floor with the colorful screens behind him. I also like their selection of dance music. 
I strongly recommend you to purchase tickets through their website online so you can bypass the line when you enter the club. I always suggest getting to the club as early as possible because every trendy nightclub always gets super packed by midnight. 
I ordered a midori sour from a female bartender with tattoos all over her arms, and she mixed the most perfect midori sour I ever had.

The main dance floor was super packed when I went for ATB, I could barely move. Luckily, I'm super tiny so it didn't bother me very much. The outdoor area is nice, big, and equipped with a big screen by the back bar so you can still see the DJ spinning from inside. 

The hip hop floor is waaaayy too crackin .. It's too small and dark for my taste. Quite creepy if you ask me. 

If you don't have a good hook up and enter the club from a lower floor, there's a bunch of stairs that you have to walk up, which is a complete pain, especially if you're in heels! 

That being said, I'd only come here if I was super in love with the headliner. If not, it's not worth all the trouble.",1,1,0

we had a guestlist pass thing....but omg, they had all the girls meet in an area and then we all walked up together...and seriously LOL it felt like they were showing us off to everyone around just to catch attention...kinda degrading we all thought....and then the line.....half of our group got in and then they stopped our line...to let other random lines in....and we waited like 30 more mins.....it was almost 12 and we swear if they were trying to hold us outside till after 12 to make us pay...forget it!

after all that crazy waiting, we finally got in...and OMG again the STAIRS!! wtheckkk. lol its like a work out. then the craziness began, the trance room was packed and the hip hop was even crazier! trying to find your friends was sooo hard. i can usually deal with crowds and being packed like sardines, but this night i could not take it. i even felt claustrophobic and had to  give up and head on out.

We bought tickets for the event so that we wouldn't have to deal with the line ($30 for guys, $20 for the ladies). We got there after midnight and were still forced to wait in a line, to then get into another line for those with tickets, and then ANOTHER line to get on an elevator to ascend into the club. Took an hour to get in. 

When you are let off, you are released into a bar. Walking around, you'll find this club has four main areas: the main dancefloor, which is surrounded by VIP suites, the outdoor pool area, the ""boombox,"" which is the hip-hop area, and the library, a really swank VIP-feeling area with a pool table and bartenders dressed in tight white dresses. Each area had a different feel, and the library and outdoor area weren't too crowded.

If you get there after midnight, and did not get on the second floor dance area, don't expect to get down there until around 1:30 a.m. as the bouncers will keep you moving. You'll get there later on in the night, but at midnight, almost impossible. If you can deal with this, you'll still have a good time.

In terms of drinks, they were expensive (as expected), but they were mixed strong and well, which is something I wasn't expecting, but did make me (and many of my friends) really happy. 

Now, the stairs. If you have girls in heals in your party who are going to have trouble walking around, get ready to do some carrying. This place is on many different levels (literally and figuratively), so many of the ladies will be tripping, and I'm sure the club owners have to clean a lot of blood and skinned knee flakes off that staircase every night. They MUST find a new way to enter and exit this club. Still, probably one of the new standards of club in Vegas!",1,0,0

Marquee was by far the best pool party we went to. We had no issues getting in and upon entering and receiving our wrist bands we were told girls have free drinks from 12-2 pm. Not surprising in Vegas, but still awesome. At first I thought the pool area was way too small, but there are a ton of cabanas, day beds, and these small infinity pools that you can reserve. There are two bars and a nice DJ set up. If you're drinking in the pool, they make you stay at the edges of the pool (don't be surprised if a fully clothed security\/bouncer is in the pool telling you to go to the side with your drink).

I came to celebrate my birthday with my cousins and things were fine until around midnight when we took a break from dancing. We were outside near the bar and gambling tables when I noticed a security guard talking to one of my cousins (I'll refer to him as K). I stepped in to make sure everything was ok because the guard looked pretty intense. When I inquired, the guard said that K had a flask and wouldn't turn it over. (This was true because we had asked him to bring one--although he actually didn't even use it!) The guard said he had to leave, so I said we were sorry and we would all go with him. Yes, these things happen and I knew we were wrong for bringing the flask. When I said we were going, too, the guard said we couldn't go with him, but we could meet him somewhere. I grabbed a few of my cousins and we just hurried through the club as the guard led him away. Then another guard came by to help escort him (K was compliant and it seemed unnecessary to have two guards, but whatever. We just hurried up to make sure we could be with him.). Anyone who has been to clubs and has gotten asked to leave knows that it is normal and expected for your group to go with you to make sure everything is ok. But when we reached the elevators to go down, they wrenched him away from us and now there were six guys. Four were in the elevator with him, pinning him against the wall. We asked the two men in front of the elevator, who were blocking us from him, why we couldn't go with him. We said that we didn't want to cause any problems, but we just needed to know he would be ok. My cousin tried to have the manager let her in, but he pushed her back.  K started calling for help because they were hurting him. We could see that the four guards had him slammed against the wall and were starting to choke him out to keep him from calling to us. I can still see the fear in his eyes and I will never forget the sounds of his voice. He was so scared and we were so helpless, trying to just protect him from whatever was about to happen. K is the sweetest kid, and he was compliant.  He was not drunk or belligerent. They were using unnecessary force and they wouldn't even tell us where they were taking him and why 4-6 men were needed to make him leave. He struggled against them only when they started hurting him and choking him. We left the club and asked the front door bouncer what we should do next and where we could find him. He advised us to go back to our hotel because they would most likely put him in a cab. But it was so suspicious that we couldn't just leave with him! It's as if they didn't want us to witness what they were doing, which was using unnecessary force for no good reason. We left for our hotel and told the rest of our family to wait there to see if they would release him, which they did about 20-30 minutes later. 

When K came back, he told us what happened. He had been choked out (there were red marks all over his neck) and he was holding a paper towel covered in his blood. He had woken up on the floor near a back elevator of the hotel because they had choked him out to the point of a black-out. If that wasn't traumatizing enough, the guards asked him repeatedly what he remembered. He was alone and afraid, and although he remembered every horrific moment of their abuse, he was afraid to say a word of it. He knew it'd make it worse and they'd probably keep him longer...so he said he didn't recall. And they implied that he had probably accidentally hit his head or fell and passed out somehow. But the truth is they did it! They feigned ignorance and pretended to play nice at that point to cover up their dirty deed. They got him a paramedic to clean up all the blood on his face and hands...there was even drops of his blood on the floor. He cried when he told us because he was so traumatized.  My heart truly broke for him and I was so appalled at this wrongdoing. It could have happened to any of us! It has probably happened before to other people...people who were compliant and didn't want any trouble, just like K. We knew we had to try to do something to correct this huge injustice and act of violence, so we called the Cosmopolitan hotel to file a formal complaint. Then we called the LV police. They sent two officers to our room to take down a report. Neither acts yielded any progress. I felt that we got brushed off as if this incident wasn't important. I cannot believe that nothing can be done. I fear for everyone's safety that goes to Marquee now. I will never set foot in this club again. I advise that no one else go here either. What happened is so wrong, and I plead with you to spread the word about this injustice. Please do not give this place your business.",40,3,3

Their first tip that this wasn't going to be a good experience was witnessing the racist staff at work. There was a group of classy well dressed african American women, 6 of them, who were in line to get in. The bouncer rolled over to them and said only 4 girls would get in. Clearly an obvious move to refuse entry to this group. Mystified they went away. If I was there I would have raised an amazing stink. The lack of intelligence and ignorance of this bar and staff is nothing short of disgusting. Second, later in the night one of girlfriends friend was dancing away with her eyes closed swaying to the music. Bouncers came up to her and and asked for her Id and for her to leave because they felt she was too drunk. Clearly not drunk she asked them what the issue was. They rambled on with crap made up excuses until finally she left with the rest of the girls. In addition they were with holding her cdn drivers license.

It was our first time here and we had a great time. Out of all the popular clubs in Vegas, we've had the best experience at the Marquee. IMO, it's way better than that Omnia sardine can and less expensive than XS on drinks... I don't even want to talk about Hakkasan. Suffice to say that although the place can get crowded, the crowd was a good crowd, the music was great, the entertainment was great and the prices were just right for Vegas. 

I don't know about all these rooms people have mentioned; I couldn't find them... But then I was heavily enjoying myself on the tiny dance floor to even look for them. The patio was closed (for shame, as I really needed the air). I also don't remember going through this flight of stairs I've read about. The process was fast and pretty smooth from what I remember.

What else... Yes, the bartenders were pretty cool & didn't mind keeping me hydrated with free h20. We met an awesome couple from Britain and some other folk whom we partied with long after the after hours club had ended. So yes, I do recommend going to this club. 

Also, bouncers can be douchey but we always pay for entry to avoid waiting on these clowns & diminish their sense of power. But if you're in a pickle, the guest list line was working pretty fast even though it was very long... I mean, who isn't on the guest list these days, ya know...

Very accurate reviews!  Got in via a promoter and my date was free.  At first, I was hesitant on the $50 charge for me....but heck Vegas shows are that much or more.  Get there early if you can!  10pm is cool to walk around and check the place out. 1am is PACKED, which is also fun in a different way but you have first dibs on the dance floor.  Music was amazing, atmosphere was amazing, clientele was amazing.  An experience of a lifetime.  My GF thinks I'm a freaking genius for picking this place.  Drinks are priced okay for a nightclub of this caliber.  For example, a cosmo martini was $16 and other mixed drinks were $12.  Priced high until I ordered 2 Bloody Mary's the next day at the pool of Ballys and the waitress said $30.  Compare the pool filled with old people at 11am to the atmosphere at Marquee and the $16 seems reasonable.  Customer Service was A+. It was ""Welcome to the Marquee, Have a wonderful evening."" from security at the entrance.  Helpful with questions on exits.  Bartender was extremely courteous.  DJ CHUCKIE freaking rocked and the extras the club does on the dance floor makes you feel like your in a damn video.  
HELPFUL HINTS:  1) As in recent posts, bring flats ladies.  After wards there are stairs, not many, but after 4-6 hours of dancing you will feel them.  Once again I seemed like a genius to the GF for bringing this up. 2) Not sure you need a table to experience it.  I saw groups of 14 buying a table, which divided up sounds fun.  But after getting the pricing of a table, getting my lady in free and me paying $50 was still an experience for much less cost. 3) I got the promoter's info from passing by one of those obnoxious people handing out cards in front of Planet Hollywood.  I normally walk by, but heard one of them say ""Marquee VIP"".  He took my ph #, I got texted by promoter around 6-7pm, he got us in at 10pm with the GF free.

My favorite pool parties in Vegas happened to be in this very place. Sure, I have been to the other popular ones but Marquee Day Club? There's no comparison. And when you get a cabana with your girlfriends? Well, forget about it.

I've been here with 8 girls, 12 girls, 18 girls and even 21 girls! We've always had a blast. The promoters always get us in without any wait. Gave us an open bar for an hour at times. Sure, lines are out the door but I guess it helps when you have pretty friends? :) Thanks girls!

There are 2 bars inside and also the waitresses all over. I like the bar on the right when you get in but the bar on far left of the pool is usually better in the summer time. And the cabanas in the pool ? Love love love!

We've been here on weekends only so I'm not sure how it is on weekdays. But they also play different kind of music on weekends. One time, they were playing emd type songs and the other times were mostly hip hop. It's not like you need a reason to do day drinking in Vegas but when you do, doing it with a great pool party is always a plus. The crowd seems nice most of the time as well.

But I have to comment the dancers performing during ATB are ahhhmazing. I think I focused more on them than dancing at one point. Even though they don't do much and there faces are covered that is not the point. The little dancing they do is good nonetheless. And I loveeee seeing ATB. He's always on a good one and he actually djs for a long time.

The club though... eh - oddly shaped and somewhat small in my opinion.  I expected it to be a bit bigger I guess? but the music overshadows all of that.  The outside area was nice where you can get a drink and catch some air, but definitely crowded since they closed off the pool area at night. 

The main stage was great with the beautiful lights and platforms where dancers would come out in their elaborate costumes every now and then.  They had this awesome blast of cool air every now and then to cool you down while dancing and of course, confetti raining down every half hour.  Who doesn't love that? We were pretty close up front and got a great view and danced all night, which was awesome... but oh my goodness did it get sweaty in that little dance pit.

They do have a seperate hiphop room but its very small. IMO i always check to see whose spinning at the club, if you dont like the music sorry to say this but there are other venues in vegas that are still very nice and probably easier to get into and with cheaper drinks. That being said, if you want the absolute easiest way to get in every time, especially with big name Djs, is to pre buy your ticket online via their website. The next best way is to find a promoter. The good\/bad thing about this is you have to spend time setting it up, and its still up to the promoter to respond back to you and take care of you. Many times they may not be at the venue or not very good at getting back to you. Staying at the hotel usually gets you 2 free admissions per room per night, but is subject to whatever the door feels like doing that night. The Club itself has a lot of stairs, lots of stairs, be prepared to walk A LOT. drinks are typical for vegas, meaning expensive. If you drink a lot and have enough people, a table might be worth your while. Marquee dayclub is attached to the club just dont fall in the pool. The most important tip at this venue is watch anything valuable you might have with you. I had my wallet, stolen right out of my front pocket. I wasnt drunk or heavily intoxicated at that time. I was in the middle of the main floor dance floor when it happened. We searched for it on the floor but never found it. The security was very helpful in trying to find it, but to no avail. The club security and hotel security both admitted to me that they KNOW there are pick pockets who work the club and steal wallets, phones, watches, jewelry, pretty much anything that can be taken from you when you are drunk, dancing around or just packed into the venue on a busy weekend night. The next time i go back im bringing a wallet with a chain. that being said the club itself is nice, the lines can be long, if you like the music and can afford to spend the money for the drinks, its not bad. Just do what the security says and bring a taser, JK dont do that but really, buy tickets ahead of time, follow the dress code, and have fun.",2,0,0

I went on a Monday where drinks were supposedly free for females from 10p-11p. That was a lie, the bartender was super rude and said that it didn't apply to hard liquor. Maybe it should have been advertised that it was only beer or something and not ""free drinks"". The place was jammed packed too - it seemed like they were way over capacity. 

My friends and I decided to go to the dancefloor..worst decision ever. In the span of the 5 minutes that we were there, my friend was touched inappropriately and my phone was stolen right out of my purse. When we went to the security to report it, they never did anything. They were rude, was not helpful at all, and all they said was to come back the next day to look thru the lost and found. They didnt even try to help us report it to the police. We left right away and took the cab to the police station ourselves. 

I knew my phone wouldn't show up in lost and found but we still went back the next day in the hopes that maybe it had turned up. The girl that was in the lost and found booth was rude and had no customer service. There was music playing loud in the lobby and she was sitting all the in the back of the booth, expecting us to hear her. She never came up to speak with her until we told her that we couldn't hear her, and only then did she get up to look thru the lost and found file. 

Overall, the people at Marquee needs to learn what customer service means. I will never come back to Marquee after their horrible service.",4,0,1

Word of advice, get in line before 10!

When I first got in, I only thought there was 1 floor but I found out theres actually 3 floors! The main floor then downstairs is the hip hop room.  There's also cabanas outside by the pool to sit around too.  When I went, it was super windy outside so I stayed inside most of the time.

It got really crowded throughout the night, people were spilling drinks everywhere; on people and on the ground.

I loved the music they played on both floors.  I spent half my time on the main level & my other half downstairs!  Outside by the pool area is really nice as well.  The bathrooms are very clean too which is definitely a plus for girls.  It was filllled with Asians! But being an Asian girl myself, I loved it. haha

Luckily I was with competent people that have been there before that lead us in the right direction.  

Once we got to Marquee the view of the buildings on The Strip were pretty amazing.  You've got the pool that comes right up to the lounge chairs to the right and then all the bright lights, signs and buildings surrounding you.  There are a few dance floors inside and there is another area outside that has almost jacuzzi like pools with tables.  So if you're feeling stuffy and just want to get out off the dance floor you've got options here.  bars are abundant in this place so you don't have to trek far to get your next drink.  There's even some blackjack tables that are available for those that didn't get there fix downstairs for $25\/$50 a hand.

Many people left around midnight including us since we couldn't move at all.  The dance floor was also small for the top 40's music, and downstairs seemed like a rave with rude people.  Ghostbar, Rain, and Moon were so much more fun at the Palms.  Pure at Caesar's is worth checking out for the great view.   But if you still want to check out the newest club on the block, just beware you are in for a night of waiting in multiple lines (even with guest list) and being pushed around and waiting around for pricey drinks with poor management.

Below is my incident at Marquee Day Club:

My letter to the Cosmopolitan Marquee...ignored by the management :(

RE: Pool Platform Hazardous to Guest Safety

Dear Cosmopolitan Marquee Management,

I attended the Cosmopolitan Marquee day club at the pool on Friday, July 15.  Since there were music playing and fellow guests were dancing on the plastic box containers in the pool.  I decided to join in so I climbed on the clear raised platform by putting both of my knees up on the box; then I stood up on the box, which had a grid of raised squares with very sharp corners.  As I got on the platform, I felt a sudden pain on my left knee, then the crowd started to yell ""You're bleeding!""  I looked down to see blood gushing down from my knee so I hurried to get out of the pool.  

I informed the gentleman patrolling inside the pool of the sharp top of these box containers that are meant to be climbed upon.  He sent me to security by the door.  Then, a security personnel with black tattoos on both of arms came over, and I told him that the clear platform was very sharp and cut my knee.  He told me to follow him across the courtyard to get first aid.  I already wiped off the blood on my knee when I got out of the pool, but blood continued to run down my leg so I had to wipe it off again, and he made a mean remark, ""I would prefer it if you didn't use our towels, but oh well, too late now!""  Not only was the security staff inconsiderate, he was downright rude and sarcastic.  

At the first aid station, I told the Cosmopolitan\/Marquee employees that they should remove those boxes in the pool for guest safety.  The same security staff sneered and said ""Yea, I can't do anything.  People get stupid cuts like this all the time.""  I was shocked that no one cared about the danger the clear boxes pose to the safety of their guests.  

So before exiting Marquee, I tried to warn the staff about the dangerous hazard again.  I spoke with the service manager named Danny\/Denny, and he just kept saying ""We just got those boxes, and no one has ever cut themselves.""  He didn't seem to get the fact that my incident can be the first of many.  I had expected a little more consideration from the manager, but he treated me like I was just a drunk drama queen who got a small scrape.  I have attached a picture of the cut taken after the cut was band-aid; you can see that my skin was lifted off the knee by the sharp grinds on top of the clear box in the pool.  The finger in the photograph serves as reference of the size of the scrape; my skin is still raw and my knee is sore from the incident.

I am quite disappointed and shocked by the disregard and insolence of your staff.  There was no compassion or courtesy from the staff who handled this incident.  The management must be aware that the top of the boxes have a sharp top, which can easily hurt your guests.  The unsafe boxes placed inside the pool need to be removed or reconstructed to insure guest safety; it is a lawsuit waiting to happen as your staff just shrugs off the incident and disregards guests' concerns.  I hope your prestigious hotel and popular club, especially being the newest additions to the Strip, would offer your guest a safe environment on your premise and train your staff to treat guests with courtesy and respect.  Thank you for your consideration.",10,1,2

They let us in with no line or cover, large facility with cool lighting and did I mention... FREE DRINKS until 11? Overall, it was a pretty impressive-looking club inside. Nice large dance floor, lots of little ""nooks and crannies"" to hang out in, cool decorations and atmosphere, and energetic DJ playing dance music.Overall, Marquee had all the basics of a solid club. However, that being said, I've been to many clubs all over the world, so I'm a tough customer.

The bad: VERY smoky inside.. I have allergies\/asthma, so this is the reason I had to leave early. The music wasn't the type I usually enjoy, and there were no other rooms or options to explore (I was under the impression that Marquee had multiple rooms playing different types of music). It got a little boring being in the same room with the same type of music blasting for hours. Also, there was absolutely NO place to sit down except the VIP areas, which were full of scantily clad women with bottles of champagne. It was kind of tacky, honestly. After one has been dancing for a while, it is usually enjoyable to sit down and rest.. this wasn't possible at Marquee. Another reason we left early. Also, the drinks were really expensive after the ""free drink"" promotional period was over... and the dance floor became so crowded that you couldn't move.. Overall, a mixed review.

Where do I begin??!!?!

The Good:
-The club is flipping amazing.  There are three levels, each with their own vibe.  My absolute favorite was the main floor, with the electro\/trance music bumpin' all night long.  Love it.
-Beautiful venue.
-Sexy, classy clientele dressed to the nines.
-AWESOME vibe
-World-renowned resident DJs who know how to work the crowd.  Love it.
-The venue is ginormous.  It is an adventure navigating through this joint.  Fun times. 

The So-So:
-Drinks are expensive, as usual.
-The dance floors will be packed.  Period. 
-$7 bottled water.  No bueno. 

The Bad:
-Never-ending stairs.  I have seen inebriated girls stumble down them.  So take note of this: wear flats.

DJ Vice was there when we went on Monday. I don't want to curse on this review but it was ****** awesome! The music, the laser lights, the fog machine, and the free foam sticks being thrown around was the icing on the cake. IT was euphoric and mind blowing.

Beautiful 4 story clubs with the access of indoor and outdoor and also we were able to sit at the abandoned reserved table with the set of swing when we needed to cool off from the dance floor (Be nice to the bouncers). It is impossible to describe how beautiful the venue and the stage set up was (Gogo Dancers popping out randomly above the DJ?!?). For those who immediately get irritated by just looking at the crowded dance floor, just walk over to a bar and ask them for a shot or two.

'Money talks' in Vegas and we were able to skip the line and were in the club within ten minutes.

It's true, there are a lot of stairs, but it made up for my missed cardio session that day. Security inside was personable and not hostile dicks.

Will be back this Saturday July 2nd and hopefully our experience will be as good as the first.",0,0,0
