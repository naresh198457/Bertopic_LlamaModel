Well, I just stayed there again this weekend and let me say the quality of their hotel went down big time. They're doing renovations right now too which doesn't help. My brother and I stayed there and paid $700 for 2 nights and a strip view. WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL. I was very disappointed with the view they gave us and the room in the picture and the room we actually got was just so misleading. Also, the whole floor smelled like weed! Are you kidding me? I paid that kind of money to smell that the whole time. Just bad business. Don't stay there! Horrible experience.",1,1,0

I got in line for check-in at 2:43 and had my room key by 3:02, which wasn't fast but wasn't as horrifying as some of the stories I have heard.  The clerk was slightly too curt, but she did her job thoroughly.

We were on the 17th floor facing the pools and did not hear any construction or noise the entire time, other than some strange tapping from another room a couple times the last night.

The room was almost well cleaned when we checked in (I found a clothing sticker and bandaid, but they weren't obvious).  The towels were very stiff and had a burnt smell to them (like they were in the dryer too long), while my mother felt her bed linens\/pillows had an ""off"" scent to them (I did not smell anything strange regarding mine).

Maid service was adequate, with the room cleaned every day with no problems.  I brought my own pillow (theirs are the usual awful soft ones), but do wish they had a comforter or heavier blanket option (it was very cold).  On that same note, the air conditioning is a relatively modern wall vent with a digital display.

The water pressure in the shower was AMAZING.  I cannot praise it enough, it basically solidified their fourth star.  The multiple Starbucks also helped them earn kudos.

I'll my review of their fully furnished but lackluster fitness center (inside\/past the spa) in the spa and salon's page.  Watch out for it closing early (6pm)!

Watch out for pushy manipulative salespeople in the Street of Dreams!

Check out the gift shop for Monte Carlo and Las Vegas logo goods.  You do get a discount with your mLife card, though I think the somewhat strange (talked to stuffed animals) older female cashier stiffed me (it looks like she didn't apply the discount to all the items).  The MC goods might even become collectibles if the hotel does change its name...

Besides the initial clerk, all the other employees of the hotel were very friendly and professional, including the maid, concierges, bellhop, and valet employees.
There was one concierge who printed my ""will call"" tickets for Ka at MGM Grand for me and offered excellent directions via two different routes, complete with a map.

Their location is fantastic, sandwiched between two higher-end resorts (Aria and Bellagio, with other neighbors including Cosmopolitan, Vdara, and Mandarin Oriental).  Thanks to the free tram that arrives every 6 or so minutes, you can easily enjoy the amenities of the more luxurious neighbors (and charge all the MGM-owned Resorts to your room too).  It's slightly more difficult to cross the street, as it involves walking until you get to a pedestrian bridge or crosswalk.

It is not as new and shiny as its neighbors, and thus is a little worn and showing its age (peeling wallpaper, awful cracked seat coverings for the food court chairs), but I feel it is reasonably well maintained.

I've never stayed here before, so I'm not aware of how prevalent its original theme was.  Right now it comes across as generic fancy European.  The stained glass and ornate cast\/molded ceilings are nice though.

Overall: Occupies a niche solidly above the likes of Excalibur and Circus Circus but below its immediate neighbors (Aria, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan).  My mother loved it here!  (I think she's used to the lower end or family-focused places)  I've already booked a second stay, so here's hoping the next stay goes just as well!",5,1,1

The check-in desk is close to the entrance from the parking garage.  That is not the case at some casinos.  It is convenient.  The check-in process takes far too long for me, but it is right in line with most other casinos.  They all need to get together and figure out a simpler system.

The rooms are OK.  They are average sized.  They are in decent shape.  The bathroom could use an update though.  You have to use a cable for Internet connection which is a shame.  That is not helpful for your iPad.

There are several fast food options on site which is convenient late at night.  It could use some more sit down options though.  The cigar lounge is a great place to relax while enjoying a good cigar and drink.

The pool area is OK.  The lazy river is a good idea, but you cannot drink while floating in it, so the cool factor goes away quickly.

Overall this place is OK for the price.  It is close to hot spots in Aria and Cosmopolitan.",2,0,0

This hotel had been renovation few years ago, pump the hotel class from 3 1\/2 stars to 4 stars.  It located north of New York New York and next to Aria.  

Parking structure is easy in this hotel; you can easily access to the self-parking lot and can walk to the hotel in few minutes of walk. The parking escalator was fill with cigarette smell; I did not bother going back then.

The hotel room elevator is located across the lobby, the nice thing you do not need walks by the casino.  The room's elevators are separate by three different floors level.  That was good-crowed control. Our group came just right before the standard check in time 3pm in Sunday.  There has was about 20 peoples in the line, took about half hours before it was our turn.  The clerk was helpful and we were able to get a high floor level as we request.  The view was the city center (Aria, Vdara and the pool) It was good view despite this just a basic room.  At top of that our 2 booked room were together and also in a corner.  You would always wanted corner room if want peace in Zzz.

The room is modern; there is a big 42-inch flat screen.  However, sadly the channel were not in HD, make it look worse than SD.  One of the room amenities included 2 K-Cup Coffee Pack and two water bottles.  Those were included with the resort fee, which cost almost $23. I wish there is Wi-Fi in the room, only wired is available.  To use Wi-Fi has to go down to lounge level. The room was clean and everything was functional.  The bed and the pillow were very soft, perhaps more than the way I like it.  I had trouble sleep with the bed had to take another night to get used to it.

Their casino floor is modern as well; I was impress with their sport betting room.  Look more modern than five star hotel like Wynn.  The smell of the cigarette is not strong in the casino floor, unlike some other casino I been to.  There is free tram access to Crystal Center, Aria, and Bellagio. wish it also link the tram to Excalibur, so it can access to the southern strip.

Overall, this is good hotel consider the price.  You are only paying half or one third cost of nearby 4 or 5 stars hotel.  While is still in a decent near center strip location.  This hotel can be good choice for family or those who want some peace after some crazy night in club and other activities.",27,15,22

Had not stayed there for some time but decided to do 3 days there on a recent extended stay in vegas. Look, it is not brand new and the rooms, at least some of them, can use some updating and work. I had a spa suite and it is clear it needs some updating but it was large and comfortable and clean. 

  I rented a cabana and it was great. The staff at the pool were exceptional. The cost was, if memory serves, about $500 but all food and drink purchases up to that amount are covered. At the end of the day we still had a significant amount left and they allowed us to purchase a bottle from their bottle-list to take back to the room. Nice touch. Also, we ate and drank our fill having steaks and large great-tasting drinks along with breakfast and other misc items. The staff was very friendly. The pool area itself is laid out well and also clean.

 We ate at D Vino and Dragon Noodle. Both were fine. We tried Diablo's cantina for lunch - can't say I am a huge fan. Seems way over-priced for mediocre tex-mex but the servings are quite large. 

 I just found the Monte Carlo to be unpretentious but quite acceptable and prices are fair. It would be nice to see some updates to the rooms and rumor has it that might be in the works but it is quite an acceptable and fun place to stay.

BUT, the resort does not have pool service any more (11\/5\/16). I think that disqualifies Monte Carlo from being a resort. MC makes you go to the MGM's pool which is about 1 mile away and makes it very inconvenient to enjoy a simple amenity as a pool.

The rooms are pretty standard, not the biggest or nicest in Vegas but I've certainly seen worse.  The front desk is typically pretty quick, even during peak times on the weekend.  I stayed here plenty before we moved out to Vegas, and have stayed a few times since we've been here, and I have never had to wait long, even when there was a long line.

The thing I like about Monte Carlo is the gaming floor is for GAMING.  People aren't looking around taking pictures at the art or whatever.  I feel very comfortable there.

Two things stand out to me whenever someone mentions the Monte Carlo: 

1) The pool. We really enjoy the pool mostly because of the lazy river. It's very relaxing, and the poolside music is among the least annoying of places we've stayed.

2) The casino. Very friendly confines and it's never difficult to sit\/play wherever you want. 

Monte Carlo also has easy access out back to the neighboring casinos, so you don't have to sardine yourself down the Boulevard to get where you want to go. Anytime I'm heading to Vegas, Monte Carlo is in my top three choices for rates in the initial search. She's never let us down.",4,0,0

Ive never left a bad review with any business but my first time to Vegas for my 30th Birthday was not a great experience because of this resort. 

When I booked we were told we would be in a new room. We were also told the pool would be down for renovations but we would be shuttled to the MGM pools because all of their pools will be open. So my group booked a cabana at the mgm adults only pool. 

When we arrived half of my group of 10 were given new rooms and the other were put in OLD rooms (including my husband and I). They also said they weren't doing the shuttle any longer. We got to our room and it was very outdated but the biggest issue is our toilet wouldn't work. I called the front desk 3 times before I finally got it to work but the rest of our trip it was on\/off working. Plus our shower had hair on the walls which was disgusting but I wanted to try and make the best of our trip. Next day we had to walk to the MGM pool just to find out they closed the adults only pool the previous week and didn't bother to notify us. So they placed us in the one pool open and didn't offer a discount for the inconvenience. Our server at the pool was fantastic but he's not enough for me to return to Monte Carlo.. ever. 

Even our friends that stayed in the newer rooms weren't impressed. The decor is very cold and just put together thoughtlessly. Our friends that had an old room were put in a handicap room and had to deal with construction noise at 6:30am everyday.

When we checked out I let the manager know about the issues we had and he comped our buffet at the MGM (not great) but didn't offer any comped room or discount to regain our business. So all in all Monte Carlo is a ""Get what you pay for"" situation.

This was a big mistake. We arrive and waited in line for almost an hour to check in. Finally get to the counter and are told they only have two queen bed rooms available. My husband politely explained we would prefer a king bed as we are on vacation and would like to sleep in the same bed we had no need for two queens also when we booked it we selected a king bed. The woman checking us in was younger and quickly told us that was all they had and basically take it or leave it. We asked if it would be possible to switch rooms if one became available and she flat out said no. No offer to try to help us or make us comfortable just didn't care. On top of that had to pay $22 to get in the room before 3 which is a joke. We have stayed at so many hotels in Vegas and not one has ever charged us to check in early the room is either ready or not at this point we had been traveling all day and just wanted to get in our room. Had I known what we would be walking into I would have saved myself the $22.

 The room is a joke its super dated and just looks dirty. Everything down to the ice bucket looks like its been around since the 80's. The bathroom is just gross and the room had this strange odor which hit us right when we walked in. Decided to take a shower and turned the 80'style faucet on it made this squealing noise which lasted the entire shower I was honestly afraid to touch anything it clearly had not been properly cleaned for who knows how long the shower head had mildew all over it. The worst part was getting out and grabbing what I thought was a clean towel I could smell it right away it smelled like burnt Carmel and dirt seriously I almost threw up at the very least provide people with clean towels! After this we literally dropped our luggage and left couldn't stand to sit in the room. 

We went over to aria which we love! And they helped us out with super fair room rates for 4 nights. Yes it was so bad and we were so unhappy with the service we paid more money to stay at a different hotel! We went and checked out and expressed our dissatisfaction and right away the woman explained they can't refund us the nights and could do nothing for us. My husband tried explaining he understood they couldn't refund us but he wanted them to know how bad everything was and that we actually paid money to leave ! She hardly acknowledged our complaints and sent us on our way. Not even an apology or offer to cover resort fee or anything could seriously care less about the situation. I was super disappointed I expect more from an mgm property. It sounds like this is a recurring situation as I went over to aria to get checked in and they agreed Monte Carlo is one of the worst mgm properties to stay at. I understand the folks working at the check in counters have no control over the condition of the rooms but at least say sorry call a manager over and pretend to care. We were just dismissed like okay move on we got our money and we don't care attitude. Spend your money staying at aria there room rates are very fair and the basic rooms are updated and beautiful. The service at aria is exceptional they make you feel like royalty from start to finish. Monte Carlo needs new management and a renovation asap!",1,0,0

Our flight was scheduled to be in just before midnight so I let the hotel know i would be checking in late.  They let me know they would note it and informed me about that I could use the mobile check in and pick up my key at the kiosk. Upon arrival all the kiosks were black and another guest let me know they shut down at midnight. So I had no choice but to stand in a slow moving line that was LONG! Exactly the last thing i wanted to do after a 5 hour flight. So we get to our room and immediately go to take a shower. The tray on the counter was cracked, the wallpaper looked as if it as peeling and the fixtures covered in limescale.  The drain in the super must've been clogged because it almost immediately started to fill up the tub. So we figured we would deal with it we knew that we booked a hotel under renovation. Next came the bad experience at the spa here. You can see that review there. Then the next day we decided to sleep in. Even though its difficult seeing and hearing construcrion so early. Our room was not equipped with a ""privacy please"" sign so as soon as I heard the housekeepers in the hall I asked her nicely to not come in and if I could just get two new towels. She then tells me ""okay where's your old ones?"" So puzzled I ask her to hang on and go get them when she replied with ""And your trash where's all your trash bags?"" Ummm What? No thanks!  So that night we dined at the Italian restaraunt which was probably the highlight of the hotel. They had an amazing staff.  So the next day we went to the dinner buffet. I had a 2 for 1 and honestly it still wasn't worth it. Everything was salty. I mean unbearably salty. Nothing there was edible. And the next morning we decided to again torture ourselves with a breakfast buffet that was not salty but still not edible. It all tasted bad. Then we get back to our room to find a note saying they will shut off our water for 6 hours. 6 whole hours and all we were offered was bottle waters next to the elevator that was gone in the time it takes to walk from our room to the elevator. And no they didn't bother to refill it.  We weren't offered any sort of discount or anything. Then on the day of checkout we had an appointment between checkout and our flight so we decided to leave our stuff with the bell staff.  The person who took our bag was so pushy for a tip and I never heard of tipping before service? And he kept saying ""but i want be here when you get back but I'll take care of your stuff right now"" and sure enough when we got back he was still there and surprising not eager to help ANYONE in line. All in all worst experience. Don't stay here. It's not worth a dime. I wish I spoke to a manager when I was there but the checkout desk and the bell desk line was ridiculous and as stated we had an appointment. Good luck to anyone else that braves this place.",0,0,0

I booked a Standard Deluxe Room 10-2-2015 to 10-4-2015. What I got was anything but that! 

First off, check in is unorganized and a complete mess. I waited over 30 minutes just to check in to my room. After driving 4 hours, the last thing I want to deal with is more waiting. On to my room. 

I get to my room, (room 7-114) and there's cigarette burns all over the carpet, no fridge, and no plastic bags for our dirty laundry. Then, I go to the bathroom to take a shower and to my dismay, I see that I have a handicap shower. I am not handicap, I did not book a handicap room, nor did I ask for a handicap room. I try to take a shower and I literally had to lean over backwards and wash my hair with one hand. Then, while showering I discover that the wallpaper is pealed back and there's mold, that's black! I'm no health inspector, but when mold is black, it's likely black mold and that's a huge health hazard! Hotels get shut down over that! Upon discovering the mold in my shower, I've had it. 

I call the front desk to tell them what I've discovered and they tell me in a very dismissive and ""pass the butter"" tone ""there's no guarantee what room you'll get when you book"". At this point I'm more concerned with the mold and what they are going to do to remedy the damn health hazard in my room! Instead of offering to bring us up new keys to a new room, they argue with me over putting me in a new room, and then they make me and my boyfriend haul all of our stuff downstairs that we just carried up so we can get keys to a new room. 

I get downstairs with all of my stuff, soaking wet hair from the disgusting shower in the moldy bathroom, and the front desk rep I spoke with (I forget her name, because I was so frazzled), and she rudely tells me that she'll give me half a refund on the resort fee of $56 and that she won't give me the rest of it back because I will still be staying there in another room. I had no choice, trust me, or I would have booked elsewhere in a heartbeat. It was frozen fury and all the hotels are booked full. So after this, she mutters under her breath after I tell her thanks for the half resort fee refund ""most people take the $50 food and beverage credit"".  I didn't want it because we packed our own food. Fact of the matter is there was MOLD in my HANDICAP shower! I take my keys and we haul our crap now up to the 13th floor, room 217. 

I get to the new room, and the regular shower had green and grimy build up all over it to the point where the water pressure was all messed up. My boyfriend was grossed out. To make it worse, the air conditioner didn't work and I was hot in my room both nights I slept in it. I checked my bank account this weekend and see no refund from Monte Carlo, so I called the front desk again and asked for a manager. I spoke to a man, who had a very condescending and very dismissive attitude as well, and I tried to talk to him yet again about the issues from the previous room and told him about our current issues in the new room. That guy couldn't care less about my concerns and I could tell. He had a dismissive response for everything I said. I'm sorry, $28 refund doesn't cut it for everything I dealt with: handicap shower, black mold, cigarette burns on the floor and a gross and grimey shower in the new room. This entire experience ruined my boyfriend & I's first trip to Vegas and I will tell every single person who ever asks how awful it is here, from the cleanliness to your rude staff. I feel like I deserve all $420 back I spent after this.

The rooms are definitely affordable and enough to make you feel like you're in an okay hotel.  The rooms just need some upgrading....and take it easy on the air freshener sprays within the hallways.  Rooms need a fridge (even if it is stocked with drinks), better furniture, and an improvement on the small details like design, color and style.  But, it works because the location is better than you would think.  There is great access to the strip and all the great places nearby via the LV Blvd frontage.  There's also a passageway from the food court to get to other retail stores and it takes you to the Aria property.  Very convenient.  Didn't have to get in my car or take the tram.

There's pedestrian access to LV Blvd to get you to NYNY and MGM.  There's also less obvious roads to get you into and out of the property without having to utilize LV Blvd by car to avoid pedestrians crossing.  On top of this,  there will be a cool development known as The Park, which will bring great open areas to chill.  The plans somehow remind me of some corporate open areas with water features over in Costa Mesa and Irvine.  Kinda cool to see something different in LV.  The sports arena and theater will bring lots of people when it opens.  It will definitely be a future cool spot.

The staff was great during check-in, and checking out was easy.  Rooms and views are just pretty average though.  Sadly, I was on the third floor and had a great view of all the rooftop equipment.   The spa had options, nothing really over the top.  It's a good feature to take advantage of to enjoy and feel refreshed.  The Pub service was excellent.  I also thought breakfast there was satisfying. Didn't get to try the buffet....didn't feel like wasting a meal there.

Since I had never been to the Monte Carlo, I had lofty expectations.  Some of them were met, some fell very flat.

Pros - 
Location - easy to get to from the airport and in the middle of the action on the strip.  Valet is easy in and the staff was very nice.

The casino\/hotel area - very nice lobby and casino area.  It's clean and better ventilated than some others.  

Restaurants - the on site grubberies are generally better here than other properties.  Really likes the Pub and 800 Degrees.  Thought the location of the Steak House was strange (on the casino floor basically).

Cons -
The hotel portion could use a few bucks and some hours spiffing up.  The carpet in the hallways was dingy, dirty and wrinkled up.  Looked like my old Aunt Helen on a Friday night.  The room needs some sprucing - fix the sink, paint some walls, etc.

Security was lacking in the hotel area.  A young lady of the night rode the elevator with us as she was 'changing rooms' wearing one stalking and a men's shirt.  Crazy activity in the halls throughout the night as well.

One of the best things about this place is the Pub and it's tucked in the back, away from the strip.  The dueling pianos have been cancelled - with no wonder as the place is hard to find.

Wifi only on the bottom two floors.  Doesn't do much good to have a wireless device and a wired connection 30 floors up.

The hotel room and casino floor is pretty standard.  Has everything you need but nothing fancy.  It's also centrally located to all the other major hotels so it's walking distance if you don't want to deal with driving or cabbing it.  

My favorite part of this hotel is the pool area. It has several pools and a lazy river that you can lounge around all day.  However, in full disclosure, the clientele tends to be a little on the trashier side so expect plenty of drinking, swearing and cursing.

Rooms - the rooms are clean and simple.  BUT, the sound insulation was terrible!  I can hear every word when my neighbors were talking, walking around, washing up, etc...  There's a door inbetween our rooms.  Looked like the gaps in the door were huge.  We were almost sharing the same room.  That's a bit uncomfortable since they were all girls.

Gambling - there are not much slot machines.  They had ""network problems' for a day while I was there.  The tables were not very full.  Crap tables mostly played with minimal bets.

Go up to the room to find that the beds weren't made and the sheets had stains on them. So we went back down to the main desk again and complained, they all of a sudden had a king room available, which I commented that was our original reservation. I was corrected by the front desk clerk and was told they don't make reservations, they take requests for rooms. So if you make a reservation, in there eyes it is a request so you may not get what you want or need for accommodations.

This was my first time staying at the Monte Carlo. The staff we encountered (valet, front desk, etc.) were all very courteous and helpful. Our room was decent size, clean and for the most part comfortable. I may have high expectations when it comes to linens *SNOB ALERT*, I prefer down comforters and pillows, so I was slightly disappointed that they had neither. I also have had back problems, and this mattress was a little too soft for me, but I'm sure comfortable for ""normal"" people =)  Other than that the temperature was easily adjustable to our preferences, the A\/C didn't turn the room into a meat locker. 

One of the reasons I wanted to stay here was I've been longing to spend some time in a lazy river, and according to their site, they have one. Perhaps I'll need to head to Raging Waters to satisfy that longing,  because what I was envisioning wasn't quite what was at the Monte Carlo. It's on the small side, and I wasn't willing to shell out $12 for a tube rental. Either way, my bf and I enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi. The pool area is clean despite it being very crowded on that particular Sunday afternoon. 

The sweet rate I got was thanks to my MGM players club, I get emails on occasion from their casino marketing team, which you have to call in to take advantage of as opposed to booking online. I'm no high roller when it comes to Vegas, let's just say it really does PAY to look like an old gramma w\/ your players card (bungee cord included so you don't forget it!) plugged into the slot machines while you gamble away.

Gross marks on bathroom ceiling when I arrived. Internet required a hard wire (what is this, 1992?!) and didn't work when I arrived. It was subsequently fixed the next day (replaced the old school modem on the floor), but as a business traveler, this was a big problem. iPod playing alarm clock also didn't work and had to be replaced. 

I had a confirmed and prepaid reservation for a king room and when I got to mine, had 2 queens (for one person). When I called to inquire, was informed that there were none. Beds were not comfortable and I've arrived home in desperate need of a trip to the chiropractor.

Then when you talk to the management they tell you that they are undergoing a 500 million dollar renovations and that you should have known by the rates that you would not be able to relax.

Beds were extremely comfortable and I loved the pillows to the point I wanted to take some but refrained from doing so.

PROS:
-the beds are awesome
-the people are awesome
-the breakfast at their buffet was pretty good, WAY BETTER than MGM
-they have a little food court right across the lobby which is very convenient. Starbucks too.
-they have a tram connected to the hotel that will take you to aria and bellagio so you won't have to walk all the way over there. 

CONS;
-the pools were way too dinky for my taste. I mean, my brother loved it because he's a kid but i thought the pools were way too close to each other and the space seemed very compact and limited.

Monte Carlo is great because it's located right next to the new hotels including Aria and Cosmo and in close proximity to Planet Hollywood and kid friendly areas such as the M&M store.

So if you get hungry or have a craving, there's a mickey d's and a starbuck inside the hotel.... awesome! Now for the reason why I gave them 3 stars....

There was construction on the strip so our way out to the strip was through Aria. Ok not their fault. However in our room, turning on the water was obnoxiously loud. I don't know why it was sooo loud but turning on the faucet and the shower was incredibly loud. We heard our neighbor's shower at one point but didn't the rest of the time we were there... it was just really weird to me.  Also the website said wifi access which there was none. I had a job application to apply for and had to go to the 2nd floor business center to complete my application, where I was not greeted or asked if I needed help for anything.

The new Minus 5 Experience (bar made entirely out of ice-even the cups) is a welcome addition, as well. They really needed something new and fun. 

Rooms are the same as they have been for at least 3 years. Very basic but comfy beds and bedding. Still a lack of water pressure and hot water at times if you shower in the early am. I stay here on business trips and I think a lot of other places do too because of their stellar wait staff ad conference room service. We have seen the same faces for 3 years and it's always nice to see the company loyalty there. 

Check-in is always a zoo. The Staff makes up for it with friendliness and I have never been denied a request for a complimentary late check out. 

Food court in the casino makes dining on the cheap possible. They even have subway with the $5 footlong. An unheard of Vegas meal price! The food court includes a Starbucks, Subway, McDonalds, Rubios and Haagen Daz. 

Around the corner from the casino in the shops is a great watering hole simply named, The Pub. Great food and good for watching sports. Best Kobe beef burger in town. 

Monte Carlo has a wonderful pool area with volleyball courts, lazy river and a wave pool. The bar by the pool has great drink specials before 3 pm. Try the frozen pink lemonade concoction. 

If you gamble- don't here. Tightest casino I have bet been to. They have added a bearable game area with dancers to compete with Planet Hollywood's Pleasure Pit which seemed to be a big hit with a lot of the male coworkers. 

Brand Steakhouse turns into a karaoke bar on Thursdy nights which is a tradition for us at my job. It is small and gets very crowded so reservations are recommended but they will hold $50 intuit card even though the table seating for reservations is first come first served.

I had no problem until I arrived at the check-in counter at 2:00AM. Apparently they sold my room to another tourist that arrived to check-in earlier. I'm sorry, I thought I was in Las Vegas, a city that doesn't sleep. Checking in at this time with a confirmed room reservation should result in a room. My room. Period. So, they bumped me to another room (no upgrade, but discounted rate since the room was less than what I had reserved) and promised I would get my better room in the morning. Guys, this room absolutely reeked of pot smoke and there was blood on the sheets. They moved us to another room, but again there was no apology or upgrade. I was furious.

Then there is the pool, or what could be better described as the cesspool of hair and filth. One jump in the lazy river and I had wads of hair catch on my arms. Disgusting. We promptly left the pool area.

One of the attempts made by customer service to make my stay better was a free buffet for two coupon. There are hundreds of other places to eat in Las Vegas, and I would recommend them all before you eat at the Monte Carlo. It's not that everything was horrible, but it left much to be desired. The ice cream machine spewed out liquid wannabe-dairy-product and the rest of the desserts were mini-frozen pies\/cakes that you can buy in bulk from your local Costco.

City Center has really affected the standard for Las Vegas hotels.  I will also credit Wynn as well.  Both sides of the spectrum are represented.  City Center = Modern or hip and Wynn = Elegance and warmth.

There is nothing wrong with this hotel per say.  It is simply just average.  The customer service has severely slipped here over the last couple of years.  I truly believe the only reason they keep their rooms full or semi full is based on their location.  they are almost dead center of the strip and have easy access to Aria.

The rooms have received some upgrades and start out clean but we had an issue where we knew the housekeeper had not wiped off the toilet seat on our second night.  HUGE no no if you want a good review from me.  Two things a hotel has to do for me to earn a high rating.  Personal attention and clean rooms.  My two biggest rating categories for a hotel.  

P.S. Horrible Wifi too.  It will work for a few minutes then shut off.  

I have stayed here numerous times in the past and when I checked in, not even a welcome back Brian.  WOW, really Monte Carlo?",0,0,0

When they didn't get it fixed the first day she found us to apologize and tell us she had called again.  The pool servers, although there didn't seem to be very many of them, were very helpful with picking out the right drink and bringing buckets and ice to make sure the drinks didn't get too warm in the heat.   As far as the hotel itself - it needs work.  The rooms are pretty beat up and could use some TLC. For the most part the room was clean and sufficient.

We got the deluxe room, the least expensive one and it was big enough (400 sq feet).  The restaurants (Diablo's Cantina, the Cafe) and other things (Ice Bar) the hotel had to offer was pretty pricey, but hey, what isn't pricey in Las Vegas? I wouldn't recommend Diablo's Cantina because it was probably the most expensive tacos and burritos we've ever had, which tasted pretty regular. As for the Ice Bar, I would recommend it as a once in a lifetime thing. I believe it was $16 to enter and you get one free shot.

As for the service in the casino, I would only sit down and play a slot machine for 5-10 minutes (I did this about 3 times, one a day) and a cocktail waitress had already come by and offered a me drink. That's pretty fast.

I didn't go swimming, but I did get to take a look at the pool(s). They had a lazy river! I wish the pools in Vegas weren't so crowded so that I'd feel comfortable enough to go in. What was cool was that there were employees at the gate entrance of the pools checking for room keys. It's always better when outside customers aren't allowed in the hotel's pool.

Complaints. One of the towels had a black ink smear on it. I guess house cleaning forgot about that towel. Also, they only have wired internet, not wifi. Good thing we didn't just have my ipad and had a laptop as well.

I would stay here again but not before I searched up other hotels first (just because they missed that one towel and because there's no wifi).",2,0,0

This was my second time staying there, my first time was awesome, so I thought I should stay there again. Upon arrival my room was something straight out of the 80's. The room had barely functional furniture, bathroom tile was cracked and dingy. It smelled recently smoked in and just depressing. After 30 minutes of trying to get use to it I called the front desk. 

After an exchange with manager Erica, my room was changed to one of the suites. I thought my problems were over but they were just beginning. While I had no issues with the new room I had to deal with some seriously intrusive and aggressive situations. 

Intrusion was daily by the cleaning lady that would never knock but would just walk in to the room. Every day I would tell her in both English and Spanish to knock. Yet in either language she didn't quite understand the concept. 

One early morning around 4:30 am, as I'm trying to get sleep I start to notice the smell of marijuana in my room. It was coming from the adjoining unit next door. I called the front desk and spoke with the manager who's ridiculous solution was to have me change rooms at 5am. He said he would dispatch security to the neighboring room. 

Security did not go their room, in fact he came to mine and was aggressively pounding on my door as if it was i that was committing some infraction. When I open the door his tone was escalating in aggressiveness. I felt fear for my safety so I yelled at him to leave several times and slammed the door. 

The managers solution was to credit the evening of hell. However the darn resort fees for that night still remained cause this resort specializes in terrorizing its guests. Oh by the way those resort fees are the biggest scam. The pool was operational for only 2 of the 6 days I was there. With no alternatives. They charge you for services you don't use or if you do they are services that you still have to pay for. 

So to wrap up rooms are disgusting, security terrorizes guests, cleaning lady can't understand any language, management is not willing to help, and they will scam you with false fees. AVOID AVOID AVOID!",6,2,0

My only real expectation was That the room would be clean, even if just the bathroom. I won't go into too much detail, but I think the attached pictures speak for themselves.

The bedding happened to be clean, but I can't say the same about the carpet. 

After reading a few other reviews, I understand that this hotel was built in 1989, but I don't buy that as a valid excuse for controlling a mold problem by layering with years of bathroom epoxy until enough people complain. Supply and demand, I guess... 

Note to Monte Carlo:

1. Taylor Swift was also built in 1989, and she's never looked better. 

2. Hard water can be easily removed with vinegar and baking soda, a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, or bleach.  

Tips to potential guests: 

1. If you're particularly sensitive to mold, mildew, or weird smells in general, this hotel is not for you. 

2. Bring socks and wear AT ALL TIMES.

Interior decor is nice, it's not run down or dirty.  It actually reminds me of a slightly downgraded version of the Bellagio.

Pretty simple & boring casino.  The Deal or No Deal slot (which kept giving good payout) was under maintenance 4 of the 5 times I attempted to play.  

Not much to do on this property.  But it's so close to City Center, that I didn't find this to be much of a problem.  Parking lot is also not a nightmare, so I could easily hop into my car & adventure away.  ***They will be opening two new bars in the near future, including a Minus 5 Ice Bar.  Something to look forward to.

The valet was really great.  I have to say this because at other properties, they usually yell at you for even pulling into the valet lane if you're just doing a pick up.  A friend picked me up, and the valet allowed her to just wait in the front, off to the side (instead of having to circle around again).  They were super nice and chill about it.  

The bell desk was prompt with my bags.  Upon check out, I left my luggage with the bell desk and told them I'd be getting my car from the parking lot.  As I pulled up to the front, my things were right there waiting for me.  No mix up, or anything.  

Buffet was very limited, didn't try the rest of the other eateries (there's about 7 others).  I did make visits to the nice little food court for fast eats.

I could see the pool from my room, and it was very active and crowded.  A live DJ was spinning loud music.  

Room was okay, although the drain in the tub was disturbingly clogged.  The TV is the older box kind, which meant that there were some discolorations on the display.  

I noticed that there were many families with children, something to take into consideration.

My keys kept getting deprogrammed, because the front desk had a discrepancy with my reservation.  I had to go down there 3 times, and  because it was during 4th of July weekend, the wait was horrendous.  There was someone else in line who had problems with their keys, too... Interesting.

Resort fee is low ($12+tax on my most recent stay)... Although no one explained to me all the perks that were included with it until my 3rd night there :(  In case no one informs you, it includes in-room internet, use of the fitness center, printing of tickets, and two water bottles\/per day.

There is no front entrance to the check-in counter. We had to park so far and walk through several hallways just to get to the check in counter. 
At the check in counter was the shortest line with the longest wait, frustrating right? 
We finally got to our room and realized the toilet wasn't working right. The room isn't what you would expect. I used to think Monte Carlo was one of the nicer properties, today I know better.
No bottled water as promised, no coffee maker, no mini fridge. I spent $10 this morning just on some liquids to keep myself hydrated.

To make matters worse, I woke up to the sounds of jack hammers and drilling. Not a very soothing way to wake up.

In the summertime they play music out by the pool. It manages to be sort of relaxing even though it's crowded. There were people of all ages which I didn't mind. I don't appreciate bros with bacon skin and hair gel fist pumping, so although its not a Vegas beach party in the Carlo's pool area, it's still fun enough.

Also, this hotel is pretty small especially by Vegas standards, so when you and your drunken girlfriends come back from partying, in your clubwear and heels, gripping each others hands for dear life so you don't fall ass over tea kettle onto the casino carpet, you can STILL find your room.

I'm one of those people who always look forward to experiencing something new!! And it would be pretty accurate if you were to say I also prefer ""the finer things in life"".

So my family and I are on a 3 day vacation in Las Vegas. The vacation was offered through a third party. The options for hotels were Excalibur, Rio, Stratosphere or the Monte Carlo. Of course I chose the Monte Carlo over the others. It's right in the middle of all the action ON THE STRIP. 

Pulling up to the hotel was a bit disappointing because there's a lot of construction going on just outside the entrance. As I tried to snap pictures of the front of the hotel I thought ""this sucks"".  Nonetheless, I was still excited about our stay. 

Once we got to our room.... The long face and diva attitude was in full throttle. We paid for a room upgrade through the third party and received the most basic, standard room in the hotel. There is nothing nice about this room. The wallpaper is peeling off the walls around the baseboards in the room and bathroom.  It looks to be the original furniture from when the hotel was first built. I stated, we could've done better at a Marriott!! After spending a little more than an hour complaining over the phone we decided to hurry and hit the pool, BEFORE IT CLOSES at 5:00!! Yes, 5:00pm. (Check-in starts at 3pm; there were tons of people checking in at 3:00. The line looked like we were waiting for the DMV to open!!) 

They have three nice-sized pools. Well, a pool, a lazy river & a wave pool (like Raging Waters). It was only about 70 degrees outside so the hubby and I went for the jacuzzi. Yuck!! It was gross!! You could see the oil and dirt in the water. I felt like I was sitting in someone's dirty bath water. I couldn't take it. I went to the lazy river until it closed, which was much better. Oh and there are plenty of lifeguards around too which is really nice. 

When we returned to the room we showered so we could go out and sightsee. More disgust: the shower head is corroded and the water sprays out like a strong mist; the pressure is low because the lever that switches the tub to the shower is broken and won't extend fully, half the water comes from the shower head the other half comes out the faucet; the drain must be clogged because the water goes down EXTREMELY slow!! You end up standing in your soapy shower water the entire time. I don't have a newly renovated bathroom at home and my shower in my house is far better than this!

I tried to make the most of the weekend and as much as I wanna complain I said ""no, I'm not gonna be THAT GIRL"".  My hubby says just write a review to let other people know this place sucks.

- Good location - cab rides to various hotels on the strip were around $10 or less
- Starbucks, McDonald's, fastfood in the hotel 
- Relaxed casino (they advertise $5 Blackjack but there was only one table)
- Friendly staff that cares - everyone was really, really nice. I had a package delivered and they sent someone to unlock the business office for me even though it was closed 

CONS:
- NO FREE WI-FI - this ended up being a HUGE pain in the butt, especially when we wanted to look for places to eat on Yelp or look other stuff up! 
- No mini fridge - the ice machine was also broken on our floor so that ended up being annoying for the drinks we bought

I waited 30 minutes to check in and was looking forward to my deluxe king room on the 28th floor. So I was a bit more than shocked when I walked in the room only to be hit with a stomach churning smell of vomit.

Luckily the front desk changed my room to the 7th floor facing the construction and nonstop garbage trucks. At least the smell didn't make me sick but I felt more empathy for the vommiter on the 28th floor. Maybe they had the same experience with their room as I did- other people hair stuck in the towels and wash clothes, phlegm dried on the shower wall, and a crusty mildewed bathroom.

The base for a hotel is cleanliness but for a ""resort"" you may also expect furniture that is not falling apart or stained. You might want to use the pool or not have giant booming g construction sounds in your $200 massage. This would not be place for you then.

Even though valet and bell service was nice, they were handled separately. So you essentially have to tip 2 people instead of one. Front desk service, on the other hand, was awful.

That way we did not have to deal with the arena parking and could do valet at the Monte Carlo.  MGM properties now charge for parking so it cost us $13 a night for valet.  I know that is low compared to many big cities but you should not have to pay in Vegas. If we had done self parking, it would have been free since my mom is a local.

So we have to wait in a long check-in line but the process goes smoothly.  We got our room keys and headed up to the room.  And this where it all went downhill.  The room is #29130 so 29th floor, way at the end of one hallway. The room is supposed to non-smoking.  We open the door and its as if they have been smoking in that room for years and just that day made it non-smoking.  It was awful.  Every time we came back to the room or left the bathroom, it was like we were stepping into an ashtray.  Since we were only there one night, we did not ask for a new room but I would have if we had a longer stay.  The maid was in the hallway and we told her the issue and she did spray something but it did not make it go away completely.  

Also the hotel rooms and hotel itself are looking very dated and warn down. Everything needs to be remodeled.  New furniture, new fixtures.

The best part of this place was entering the lobby. It's magnificent. Beautiful. Elegant.  And the room was clean and tastefully decorated.

But...

The final rating suffers because the hotel falls so short of expectations. A pretty lobby is nice, and a clean room is to be expected even of an economy place.  For a ""resort"" hotel, the bar is higher.  You expect luxurious amenities.  You expect everything to be well prepared and for your room to be ready to go from the minute you walk in.  Ours was not.

First, access to the fitness center is NOT included in your nightly room rate.  I have stayed at many different hotels across the country and around the world, and this is the first time I've run into this. Maybe it's a Vegas thing? But it was a huge shock to learn I had to pay an extra $20 a night for something that even Holiday Inn includes at no extra charge.

Next, we found out that Monte Carlo's rooms do not have wi-fi internet access at all. There's a single ethernet cable to connect a single laptop, so your wi-fi tablet, smart phone or other device is useless in your hotel room.  If you want to stream a movie on Netflix or surf the web on an iPad, tough crap. Monte Carlo can't get it done.  Even the Extended Stay America I was at the other night could support that one.

Worse, the ethernet cable in our room was damaged by a prior guest, so we had to wait about 20 minutes for an engineer to come up and replace it.  And the picture quality on the beautiful flat screen TV was horrible, so we were pretty darn bored waiting for that engineer.

This morning we got up and wanted to make coffee.  Two problems arose -- first, due to a lack of electrical outlets, we had to crawl around behind the desk to unplug the table lamp so we could plug in the coffee maker.  Then, after making the coffee, we noticed there was no cream or sugar in the room.  We had to call down for that, and that meant our coffee was cold by the time we had cream and sugar for it.

What century does this hotel's management think we're in?  Who would put a phone, lamp and coffee maker on a desk with only two electrical outlets, and have that as the only desk in the whole room upon which guests might want to connect their laptops, recharge cell phones and other devises, etc.?  In the 21st Century, people need plugs.  This room didn't even have enough for the stuff that was already in the room before we got there, let alone for our electronic gear.

I'd love to unwind in the jacuzzi, but found out after working out this morning that would cost an extra $10 per person per use -- and the wife and I would have to be in separate rooms since they're ""clothing optional"" and the sexes are kept separate.  Is this 1912 instead of 2012?  How about one place for families to enjoy where folks just have to bite their lip and remain clothed?  Would that be too much to expect? 

And the fitness center closes at 7 p.m.  So you'd better not be someone who likes to work out in the evening.  WTH?  Just about every other place I've stayed is open at least until 9 p.m.

The pool closes early, too.  So no night swimming after a long day in the Vegas sun.  Wanna cool off?  Sneak into another hotel's swimming pool.  Monte Carlo does not have your travel needs in mind.",4,1,0

The MGM has bought the Monte Carlo and gutted it. There is no longer a river pool (just a bunch of rectangle pools being built; you must get bused to another hotel to swim during the reconstruction.

Their renovations look bad and the hard surfaces produce loud noisy echo sounds so you can't even think. There is no mini refrigerator, microwave of coffee maker (I have never seen that at a high end hotel). Low end drinks are about $9 to $14. The upstairs Diablo restaurant was rented for a wedding party and the food was so salty that several people had to spit it out and commented to me on the extreme levels salt (maybe 2x or 3x of what was needed). The choice of beer and wine at the Diablo was terrible. The room prices are rather pricey too. The shower drains were slow, the toilet loud, and dirty water spots were all over the bathroom floor when we walked in.

- we checked in at 2:30 AM (a very long travel story) to them having all their computers down for maintenance. We were seriously penciled in and I had to provide my printed reservation to confirm the price we were paying. 
- when we were given our room, the receptionist actually said, ""i can't tell you the state of this room because our computers are down""; what kind of rooms are you letting people stay in? 
- smoking room, smoking hall. see above 2 points for why this was given to nonsmokers 
- 26th floor. Okay, no complaint about actual floor, but we were 26 levels up and I could hear the pool music like it was outside my door. It played at a ridiculous high level until 5 pm every day. This does not add relaxation to a trip. 
- paper thin walls. Our neighbor received a phone call around 9 am every morning. They are apparently not light sleepers because it took about the 5th ring to answer this call every morning. I guess I should be lucky that's all I heard

PROS:
- Good shower water pressure

CONS:
- Showerhead really low, if you like water hitting your chest instead of your hair (6' tall here).
- Bathtub clogged, backs up water when you take a shower.
- No cover on the drainage.
- No USB charging, anywhere. This is 2017, not 1980.
- There's a giant construction site going on NEXT DOOR that you can hear from the 14th floor.
- Soundproofing is terrible if you want to hear your neighbor's every flush.
- The freaking table CREAKS is how old it is, and they moved the lamp over a giant freaking hole.
- Furniture is chipped, and there's no sitting chair by the window that's pretty standard at most hotels.
- Asked for a King room, get a double.
- Crack in the ceiling of the room seems legit
- Hallway carpet bulges\/bubbles out, indicating water damage.
- They charge $7 to print out a boarding pass? Nice nickel and diming.
- Cable TV has a lot less channels than you'd see at a Marriott.

Honestly, I should have spent my money at the Marriott, which is consistent in maintenance and unkeep. Monte Carlo was not an upgrade at all.",2,0,1

It was clean and nice.

Like most of the hotels on the strip, it's a bit of a maze to get through and is confusing your first day.  After that, you should know where the important things are and should be able to find your way easily enough.

Like everything else in the area, everything is overpriced.  It's the drawback of being in Vegas.  Be prepared to spend $5 on a bottle of water.

What you (mgm)  are doing is simply drawing guests away.  They will find others resorts to stay at if this continues. Nobody wants to pay $8-10 for being a guest.

We arrived very early to the hotel in expectance of having such a good time, in the three days we had planned to stay. The amount of construction that was going on literally right outside our window was unbearable to even talk to one another while in our room. We all had headaches within hours of being there because the drilling was just obnoxious. The hotel staff informed us that there was nothing they can do to accommodate us. Construction was from 6:45 in the morning until 5:40 PM, and while we were checking in that first morning, no one informed us what was going on. Not even an apology for the inconvenience. The only piece of information I knew about was the fact that the pool was under a complete remodel. But seriously, I had no idea the actual hotel was being worked on. It was really unfortunate that I had to spend my vacation and 30th birthday in that type of environment.

First thing I did was check out the room...disappointed with the lack of a few amenities (lack of shower cap, bathroom ventilation, in-room cable and cheesy Vegas guide magazines). 

In reading the other reviews, i looked for the flaws of what others said...thankfully, I wasn't bothered by some of others' comments, including thin walls and poor bedding (if you're like me, you are rarely disturbed in your sleep), The pools were awesome! We came in a group and got a cabana...totally worth it. But if you don't want to go that route...there is plenty of space around the pool. Some people picked the kiddie pool, grabbed some smalls chairs, put them in the pool and voi'la! The wave pool and the lazy river were my favorite. 

There was a variety of food options...from Diablo's Cantina to the Brew Pub to the food court. BTW: careful, the pool does not allow outside food, but allows drinks (i.e. Starbucks, McDonald's...which can be doctored, wink, wink).

The reason as to why we stayed here was because of the recent remodeling that was done after the fires that ravaged most of the top floors.  In addition, we landed a pretty sweet group deal so no complaints here.  It was no surprise that we would be guests in these aforementioned rooms of bad memories and smokey nightmares.  In addition, I was cheap and not in a good position to stay at the much nicer hotels along the strip (The Bellagio, Venetian, Palazzo, or Mandalay Bay, The Wynn...........you get my drift)

The entrance to the Monte Carlo was nice, however, given their reference to neoclassical structures and Grecian models in white stone.  The service desk to check-in was efficient but a 5:00 pm check-in?  You have got to be kidding.  Our group arrived around 1-ish and thank-the-heavens that the concierge was more than willing to hold onto our bags.

The rooms were deluxe, with two queen beds, decent desk\/chairs, a TV that accidentally got stuck playing the Lance Burton commercials that subliminally entered my mind during those crazy Vegas nights out cold, and a good sized bathroom.  What we (I'm not the only one voicing this sentiment) found disappointing was that the bathroom lacked a ventilation fan.  So every time the shower was utilized, the bathroom was filled with steam and I could hear my roomie complaining about all the steam and my hair all over the sink for the next several days  :p

The casino here is decent and they have a nice variety of tables and slots.  The Blackjack tables are slightly more expensive so my friends wanted to hit the cheaper tables down the strip.  I was very happy dropping a few dollars here and there on the penny slots, however, and played for quite a long time prior to the machine wiping me out.

Staff are extremely helpful, including the security guard who came over to us while we were checking out the model in the lobby.  He gave us some history as to the specific buildings and then let us know that they were there is we needed anything.

Good service, clean rooms.....you basically get what you pay for.  I am, however, a bit disillusioned by the bathroom (lack of ventilation fans and the horrid hard water that dried out my skin) and the fact a hotel that makes millions off the gambling hordes is too cheap to install a water softener, but that could have been attributed to the Lance Burton visions I had after leaving on the TV all night to ward off any evil spirits  ;o)",11,12,9

I was booked here by work when I was in town for CES.  I realise that everywhere's expensive during CES, but for the price being paid, I expected a significantly nicer room -- Not one overlooking a construction site where work started every morning at 6am.

The whole place seemed a bit run-down.  Like it was a glamorous place to stay 15 years ago, but now that the Bellagio and Venentian are up, they don't even try any more.

Of particular annoyance was the Lance Burton advert constantly running on the TV in the elevators.  THE CARDS ARE ALL DIFFERENT THE SECOND TIME!  I GET IT!  I LEARNED THAT TRICK WHEN I WAS SEVEN!

On the plus side: In the mornings, there was a blackjack table with a $5 minimum.  That's pretty hard to find on the strip these days.

While booking the room, I understood the place was an older hotel, therefore, had affordable prices and fewer updated features. In other words, I wasn't expecting much. However, being that it is considered a fancy, top notch Vegas hotel on the strip, I think we deserved a little better than what we got. We were even charged an additional $84 at check out (on top of the price for the room) which made it way more expensive than their advertised price. 

The Room: 
The design is very bland and boring. Nothing special, nothing stood out, nothing that made you feel as if you were in a fancy Vegas room. I booked a room that claimed it had a view of the Vegas Strip, however, we saw the backside of Aria, a bit of the Cosmopolitan, and if you really turned your neck you could barely see Caesar's Palace. The majority of the view was parking lots and streets. Not exactly the ""Deluxe Vegas Strip View Room"" that I thought I booked. 
The floors were snappy and creaky in some parts under that shaggy old carpet. Someone's hair tie was left behind on the doorknob in the bathroom (gross). The bathroom door itself would get stuck and wouldn't budge unless you put some muscle into opening it. The bathtub facet would constantly leak no matter how hard we tried turning the knob. Very disappointing all around. 

Customer Service:
Each employee was very nice and helpful. The concierge had a fun sense of humor and suggested a few restaurant options. The front desk gal was friendly and quick with checking us in. Checking out was also easy, I simply called their number and checked out over the phone which only took a couple of minutes.  

The Casino:
The few restaurant and lounge options I saw looked pretty inviting and probably good places to eat. We didn't hang out too much in there because the whole casino reeked of some type of sunblock with a strong fake coconut scent. It was very distracting and almost made me feel sick. Pretty small, unexciting place to gamble and hang out. 

The Buffet:
Las Vegas is known for their high quality fine dining. Especially their buffets. In my opinion, that's usually my favorite part about visiting the area. All that being said, this was one of the worst buffets I've ever experienced. The customer service wasn't the problem. In fact, they were all very sweet and attentive and I enjoyed their service. The problem lies within the food. The important part of the experience. It felt like a cheap cafeteria with few options and bland flavor all around. The design of the place was so boring and sad, I couldn't believe we were in Vegas. 

This was my buddy's first trip to Las Vegas and I wanted to make it a cool experience for her. Luckily she's a very optimistic person and was able to enjoy everything about our mini vacation but I'm embarrassed that I chose such a low quality place. I feel like she missed out on that extraordinary, glamorous Vegas experience. 
I only wish that the hotel would either address these problems or notify their guests. Maybe lower the prices and\/or add little perks to lessen the blow? I heard something about the place being torn down soon and that's understandable but why make your current guests suffer for it?",1,0,1

With that being said, we're already planning another trip back to Vegas and couldn't see ourselves staying any where else. I'm sure there may be more luxurious hotels but glitz and glam aren't what matter most to us. It's the experience itself. We stayed 3 days and 2 nights for my boyfriends birthday. I've read a lot of posts that claim its in terrible location. I highly disagree. Walking distance maybe, but there are many avenues for you to get to point B easily. There are free inner resort trams  and there are two DUECE tops on either side of the street next to the Monte Carlo. I love the location, really.

Let me start by telling you that I did a lot of research on the resort before booking. We looked for a fair price for the best value and I believe we got that and more. I follow the resort on twitter and direct messaged them about any questions from late check out options to birthday specials. You never know unless you ask and I'm so glad that we did.
We checked our bags at the bell desk and everyone was so friendly and they explained how it worked for us since it was our first time. We spent the rest of the day exploring the strip but still go back to the hotel before check in time. I waited for less than 3 minutes to speak to someone about a possible early check in. She explained that our room wasn't clean but she took my number and told me that I would get a text as soon as it was ready and I could also come back around 2-2:30 to see if it were ready. We went to the desk again around 2:30 and again, no wait longer than 3 minutes, and they told us that our room was ready.We were so pleased at the space of our room. The only downside was the lighting but that's my opinion. There were also no venting fans in the bathroom. Otherwise the room was wonderful and the bed was extremely comfortable. I think we spent more time in bed than the average person in Vegas just because the bed was so nice!

We laid down to rest for a few minutes before exploring again and we heard a knock at the door and before I had time to answer it a woman let herself in. She noticed that our items were in the room and quickly shut the door. She was talking on the phone the whole time so she wouldn't have been able to hear us if we had said anything. I walked out to see who it was and she was dressed in the hotels uniform and just asked if we were happy with our room. That was about it. I'm not too crazy about this incident but I'm not really one to complain either. 

Our favorite place at the Hotel would be the pool since we're not big gamblers. Tons of people so if you don't like a pool party this isn't the place for you.The DJ was awesome and everyone seemed to be having a great time. Definitely our kind of party! There are not even close to being able to accommodate lounging chairs for everyone so if you want one you better go early because they're all occupied by towels by 12pm. There's rarely ever anyone in them but we didn't want to potentially take someones seat who was just going to cool off. There were more kids than I expected but we love kids and they all looked just as happy as we were. The poolside bar doesn't have as many mixed drink options that I'd like. The lobby has a peach margarita that I was craving but the pool bar didn't have it. :( And I couldn't bring my drink from the lobby to the pool so that was a little disappointing but hey, rules are rules.

We tried the buffet and were pleased with the variety. We wen't a bit late in the morning so things weren't as fresh as they would have been earlier but it was still good quality. The Noodle company was AMAZING! Very friendly and the food was amazing! Yusho was delicious as well and the waiter was energetic and fun. The Pub's breakfast was probably my favorite meal. It was so delicious and the prices were very reasonable. The only downside was our waiter didn't make enough trips to our table for my liking. But we got everything we needed and were pleased with our experience.

The casino was nice and didn't smell too bad of smoke unless you passed someone who was smoking. We played the slots and the virtual roulette. Not one waitress asked us if we wanted a drink though. I was pretty disappointed but we didn't spend much time there anyway.

In all, I loved the Monte Carlo and can't wait to come back. We were treated so well and everyone that we encountered was so helpful. Great location and excellent for the price. Love love love! I can't thank you enough to whom ever handles their twitter account. They made our trip everything we wanted it to be and more! Kudos xoxo",3,0,0

This is the 4th or 5th time we've stayed here. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and there is a decent selection of food downstairs ranging from McDonald's to 5 star French, and everything in between. The casino floor is a bit small and smoky, but perfect for when you're not in the mood to get dressed up and go out. The spa is small and reasonably priced. And it's only a few minutes' walk to other casinos, restaurants, and shopping at the many malls nearby.

The only things we didn't care much for were the showers (high pressure mist that's definitely not my idea of pleasant) and on our most recent trip the TV didn't work properly (but we didn't call to have it fixed because it just wasn't that important to us).

Yes, you can stay at a nicer, trendier, and\/or more luxurious place on the strip but you'll pay about twice as much. We prefer to stay here, where we're always satisfied, and use the cash we saved to eat, play, and party while we're in town.",3,0,0

These suites are advertised as having a view so we were a bit upset when we found the blinds broken.  When the concierge arrived to deliver our luggage he tried to fix them and after admitting defeat, he got us a new room.  When we arrived in the new room the blinds worked but we soon discovered that the cold water handle or knobs for the tub and the mini bar sinks didn't work correctly. It was a challenge to get them to shut off.  When we used the ""Spa Tub"" which has no jets by the way, we found that the faucet was cracked on the side and water sprayed out the side of it. It's clear that this hotel does not invest in repairs, touch ups, or replacements. 
Oh and then we found mold in the shower... mold!!!

Anytime we travel we request a fan because my husband sleeps with one blowing on him... the response we received when we requested it, ""That's not something we provide."" What... for a few hundred a night you can't find a fan in your maintenance shop?
I am a Director at a large resort in another state and can tell you that I am usually understanding and sympathetic to hotels as I have probably been in their situation, however, the lack of response when we mentioned these challenges to the concierge desk, the lack of customer service combined with the condition of this room tells me that their is something very wrong with the leadership of this hotel.

I chose the Monte Carlo because of it great location and reasonable rates. The location did not disappoint, I feel like it was a perfect spot pretty much in the middle of the strip. The first problem which occurred almost instantly was upon checking in the employee at the desk stated that they did not have any high floor rooms available for a while, which we booked. We stated we would take a lower floor if it was ready. I asked for a refund on the difference and she stated there was not a price difference, I knew for a fact there was, but I kept quiet for the time being. My boyfriend asked how much a refrigerator rental was and she stated I believe something like $30 a day, we declined. We went up to the room which was average, but there was a lot of dust. I brought up to my boyfriend again that I knew the price was different. My boyfriend made a phone call and requested to speak to a manager. The manager was very apologetic and immediately put us in a high floor room which was clean and gave us the refrigerator for free for the duration of our stay(mind you the price was much cheaper then the original employee stated).

Now after stating all of that, the rest of our stay was great. We actually gambled in the Monte Carlo casino for the most part. We ate at the P.U.B. which was great. And as I said early the location and price you cannot beat. If returning, I would definitely stay at the Monte Carlo again!",0,0,0

My friend purchased our show tickets off Vegas.com and you are required to pick them up one (1) hour prior to showtime otherwise they release them to non-ticket holders. We get to the front of the line and they tell us we don't have any tickets. *Clue in the violin music and bewilder looks on all our faces*  

They ask us if we have a confirmation number which don't as we purchased them off Vegas.com. So the attendant tells us she will call Vegas.com to get this information for us. 

Not willing to stand idle as they investigate, some of us run around looking for a computer and end up paying $10 for an Internet kiosk which didn't work. Oh yeah, just in case you were wondering, the machine is located near the hotel registration desk off the lobby.  

Since that didn't work, we get worried so one of us takes a taxi to and from the hotel to get the confirmation printout from our room. Cost = $20 round trip to get what we needed.   

The other half stresses as the show starts in 15 minutes and decides to walk up to the booth where they tell us how they were able to confirm our reservation on Vegas.com just 20 minutes ago. 

The kicker, they could see us through the booth waiting the entire 45 minutes and yet they said nothing to us. We kept looking at them through the booth and went up multiple times inquiring to no avail. Plus why in the hell do they not have our reservation in their computer systems.

The hotel is way past it's prime and is worn out, literally. My room was the most Spartan room I've stayed in since the last Motel 6 20 years ago. Also, there is no pool - it is being re-done, so you'll have to go to Mandalay Bay or MGM Grand to use their pools, for ""free"" as they're MGM properties as well. My friends stayed on the 32nd floor and their room was FABULOUS! That is what I expected for the money I paid, not the worn out, out dated room I stayed in. Oh well, it is super close to the T-Mobile Arena ........to be fair I'm sure MGM will renovate this property and it will be glorious once again some day, but for now spend your hard-earned greenbacks at another property and live it up!

A great view not of the strip but of the T-mobile Arena and the desert mountains in the background. The room was on the 14th floor. The room was very clean. I was happy with my stay here. I would book another room at the Monte Carlo. I also wanted to reserve lounge chairs near the pool. So I went to the pool desk and was greeted by eager and friendly ladies who helped me decide whether to stay with my reserved lounge chairs or get a package which included umbrella, two lounge chairs, our own waitress. The package was $150. I had no quams with that after realizing the lounge chairs had no coverings and with the heat from the Las Vegas desert would have been brutal.

1. Location: It was not a bad location, especially with the tram that takes you from Monte Carlo to Aria and Bellagio.

2. The Bellhop: When we arrived to the hotel very early in the morning, this towering bellhop (forgot his name) took our bags right away so we could walk around. I'm not sure how standard this service is but I found it very nice.

Other than the above facts, this hotel was not a good experience:

1. Dirty Sheets: Upon arrival, I noticed dried blood on my sheets. Not cool.

2. Room Service: I asked for a change of sheets because of the blood stain. A guy came up to our room with a bag of 5 linens, gave us the bag and told us to change the sheet ourselves. If this were my own home, then alright. But I'm paying for this service, so I found it a bit unacceptable.

3. BED BUGS: I kept waking up to bite marks all over me and actually saw a nice red bed bug run across my linens. I complained upon check-out and the hotel management said they would do a 'complete inspection' and call me back later. Of course, they found nothing.

few reasons below:
-I got the best deal from Monte Carlo website.  I had 2 free buffets per day.  That really saved me tons of $$ spending on food.
-I guess it's weekday.  The check in was not too bad.  It's about 10-15mins of wait.
-I stayed in the 15th floor.  I had the T-Mobile Arena\/Excalibur view. It was really pretty.  My friend who stayed across from my room had the Poolside view.  It's also nice too.
-The parking structure\/Lobby\/Room entrance\/Pool are all in the same area.  I love that I didn't need to take my kids going across the casino to go to the room and pool.
-The parking fee is $8 per day.  It includes all M-Life casinos like MGM, Mirage, Luxor, Bellagio.... 
-The pool was awesome!!!  Kids enjoyed the regular pool, lazy river and wave pool.  
-The front desk was really nice and helpful when check in and out.

one star took off because:
-The room was nice and clean, but the bathroom do need a good renovation.  The shower head was rusted.  Wallpaper peeling off.. 
-The dinner buffet was acceptable for $25, but breakfast and lunch were so less selections of food.
-Pool closes at 7pm.  It's too early in my opinion.

I mean, I suppose he was doing his job, but that was a bit awkward.  

Aside from that, we went in July and the pool was bumpin' every day starting at noon (even on Sunday).   I knew they had a pool and wave pool AND lazy river, but I had no idea it would have a DJ and an MTV party-on-the-beach kind of feel all day long. This was highly entertaining and was honestly exactly what we were looking for, as we were in party mode.  My favorite part was the lazy river which no one rented the overpriced inner tubes for.  Instead, people just walked around and around the not-so-lazy river aimlessly, drinking and socializing.   There were staff posted around the river blowing whistles at you if you dared sit on the decorative island the lazy river wrapped around.  This seemed amusing at the time but it might have been all the Bud Light Limes.  

Overall the pool area was fun, loud, and packed without being uncomfortably crowded.  It was just sloppy enough to make the people watching enjoyable and it was a great place to warm up before dinner and a night on the Strip.  I would come back here solely for the pool experience.

Unfortunately, I forgot that a Vegas minute is faster than a NY minute. And things change in Vegas really fast. The people who come in and out every 2-3 days have got to be a constant wear on the city and the hotels, and with the MC, it shows.

The noise you hear from the hall can be down right scary. I jumped up a few times in the middle of the night thinking people were putting their key card into my door, but it was across the hall or next door. I could hear everything through the walls too. My sheets had a rip in them, and were stained. I dropped my room key and when I lifted the bedspread to look for it, there was a ton of crap on the floor from prior guests that had not been vacuumed. Gross.

Agree with the others who say the tv channel selection is horrible - you get 12 channels and 2 are MC in house channels, 1 is the Vegas channel which loops ads for the hotels and clubs on the strip, and 1 is a rolling commercial for the show in the MC. 

I said to everyone on the plane going home: The city of Vegas has a great PR agency. They make it look like everything is new and ritzy and glamorous, and in reality, it's all wheelchairs, oxygen machines and run down hotels unless you pay top dollar, or go downtown - where the casino employees are cute.

why didnt thier valet guy check her ticket before allowing her to put her belongings into our car!? why were her belongings already in our trunk before the car even got to the valet area? our car pulled up to valet with her stuff already in it, how?! any normal guest has to wait for their car in the valet area, give their ticket to the valet guy, then get their keys. how was her stuff already in the trunk of my car before my car even got to valet waiting area? why didnt she or he apologize? why did she quickly storm off once she got caught with no apology or anything? the valet guys working here are crooks who work with local criminals and help them steal peoples new car with dealer plates on them still so the car cannot be identified. stay far far away from here if you have a new car with dealer plates, the valet guys will give your car to away to prostitutes without checking their tickets.

our reservations were for 1 king bed,when we showed up, we were put into a 2 queen room. why?i dont know. we got into our old dirty outdated room and the neighboring wall couple were having an argument and yelling and screaming calling each other every name in the book and we havent even been into our room for 5 mins yet and my blood pressure is going up. we go downstairs to complain and tell them this is a wrong room and the people next door are in range with each other and i dont want to hear any of their yelling and just want to be put into the room we reserved (a king bed) the ""manager"" at the front told us he cannot put us in a king bed, but changed us to another room with 2 queens. fine. we get to the other room and the beds are dirty, the skirt on the bed had white stains all over them ew!!! the electrical outlet was broken, rooms were depressing, didnt even have decent sized drawers to put our clothing in. the next day (friday) we were finally put into our correct room (1 king bed) so now we have to repack everything and drag all of our luggage into the room we should have been put into in the first place. we finally get all of our stuff into our new room (now we have changed rooms 2 times due to their screw up) and decide to make the best of what is left of our trip, we go downstairs to the pool area, (which you are not allowed to float around in with a drink in your hand, you must be glued to the edge of the pool and not float around if you have a drink) after we leave the pool,we go to try and shower in our rooms and all of our water is now shut off, we have no running water to shower, use the sink, or flush our toilets. we are both drenched in chlorine, and cant shower. we go downstairs, again, to complain. the lady at the front desk tells us they are having problems with the pipes and there is leaking and they had to shut off our water to fix the water. what!!!! what kind of pos hotel is that?! this is by far the worst vegas trip i have ever had. my husband and i come to vegas at least 4 times a year and this has been the worst trip and hotel we have ever had. the only reason we stayed here is because every other hotel was already booked and we were highly recommended to try this hotel out.  the only good thing about this hotel is the location.",2,0,0

Extremely dissapointed and totally disgusted with the condition of the hotel room!!!!!   Wonder if the general manager at Monte Carlos EVER bother to check\/inspect these rooms?  He\/she should be fired for renting out such high price rooms with such filthy condition rooms!!!

12\/1\/2015:
I appreciate your response.  However I am sorry to say the response to me seems superficial.  Just empty words.... For a large corporation such as MGM who are suppose to be top notch service in the hotel industry, I would expect an offer of refund in my hotel room cost or a voucher for next visit. ($210x2, I paid for two rooms.  The second room where my children stayed, they told me security had to be called because there were fight in a room next to them, things were being thrown around and someone was screaming for her money!)",0,0,0

I stayed in this hotel for a business meeting. I know we got a good price on the rooms. The rooms themselves were standard for a mediocre hotel -- basic bed, average bathroom, coffee machine, etc.  The one nice thing was a view of the mountains to the west.  Otherwise, there was nothing good or special about the room. This may be fine for a discount price, but not for Vegas.  

However, the location for the price was great, mainly because it is next to Aria. The hotel is connected to Aria by a walkway.  There is also a tram that goes from the hotel to Aria and the Bellagio.  It is about a five minute walk to Aria and ten minutes to city center shops.  Short by Vegas standards.  Needless to say Aria is great - beautiful casino, great restaurants, overall excellent vibe.

Not so for the Monte Carlo. Going from Monte Carlo to Aria is like going from the Vegas bus station to the real Monte Carlo.  The Sports book is the best example.  In Monte Carlo it is old style, with a bunch of 30 - 40 inch TVs and a couple of non-HD big screens.  In Aria, the sports book has a HUGE wall of TV's (probably 20 ft high), all in HD.  Similarly, the Monte Carlo Casino is downscale and feels small and the restaurants are mediocre.  At night, the sports bar suddenly stops being a sports bar and instead features dueling pianos (yes a ""sports bar"" with dueling pianos).  Even the staff felt this was a terrible idea.  Unless you enjoy the downscale feel, there is simply no reason to stay on the property.

That said, if you get a really cheap hotel price, and it lets you play or eat more at Aria, it may be worth sleeping in the room.",0,0,0

From our stay it seems to be popular with overweight middle-aged White people, and frugal Asians. And luckily for me at their gym - seems neither of those groups work out!

Given my recent experience though - I will probably spend a few more bucks next trip and stay at Vdara or similar (discount rates via Jetsetter\/Hotels etc). I knocked this from 3 to 2 stars for uncleanliness. Details follow....

The Dirty Discoveries:

- Bathroom floor: dirty, especially under the sink. I mentioned once to room service, but it was never mopped. I rubbed around a towel to verify it was dirty, and not just the color of the floor
- Dirty Washcloth: the second day I was delivered a washcloth with multiple large, bright red stains in it, that looked like fresh blood. Made me think they don't bleach their towels enough. Unfortunately it was right on top of other towels on the rack. Those all went on the floor, unused.
- Found half a condom wrapper under the desk, in the far corner of the room, next to the wall (thankfully, no condom, and unfortunately too small sized for me anyway)
- Found a pill on the floor, next to the bed, while checking around to see what other goodies we might find. Googled it and it was a birth control pill, and not one that any of my girlfriends' take. And, unfortunately, of no use to me (being male).

Previous guest - whoever you were - when you leave pills behind - please leave me some of The Good Shit. Thanks.

We ended up leaving the wrapper and pill on the floor, to see if it would get cleaned up. They were there our entire stay, until checkout. To be fair - we didn't call room service and tell them about it. But, I wanted to gauge how often\/well the floors were cleaned before I performed any calisthenics on the floor. Needless to say we decided it was better off to wear socks and avoid touching the floors.

Overall I thought it was kind of funny, minus the bloody washcloth, but my girlfriends' were fairly unimpressed. I've stayed all over Vegas, and in this price range the MGM Grand was similar but cleaner. But that was 9 years ago.

In Summary -

Pros:
+ cheap
(I paid roughly $115\/night for 5 days = $585 total. I've read other folks found 5 night bargains for as low as $300. For $300 I'd give this place 3-4 stars)
+ No taxi line, ever, even peak evening times.
+ Beds were decent for a cheap stay.
+ Great, free gym, very clean, new equipment, that nobody uses. Very friendly and helpful gym\/spa staff. The gym alone would be a deciding factor in staying here again, were the rooms clean.

Cons:
- Hallways to room were worn down, dirty
- Room was very dirty - see above.
- Checkin lines looked insane most of the time I walked by. Luckily when I arrived (on a Tuesday) it was fairly dead. I waited maybe 15 minutes total. Later in the week looked light it might be painfully long in line.
- Only tried eating at ""The Buffet"". Food was overall very low quality, in all of my guests opinions, for $25\/apiece. I'm more of a quality than quantity guy, but we wanted breakfast food.

ProTip: Didn't try their other restaurants, but we found out we could have eaten at The Buffet for roughly $10\/person by calling Tix4Tonight.",4,5,0

The price for the room that weekend was pretty affordable since they were having some sort of construction outside. I was a bit worried that I would be awoken in the morning due to the noise but to my surprise there was none. The room needs to be remodeled though for sure. I wish it had a better tv and better phone reception. The colors are funky too. The hotel location was very convenient though which was a great plus for us that rainy weekend. We were able to take the tram and get to other hotels such as Vdara with no trouble at all. I wouldn't mind staying here again because it was very convenient and affordable. There was plenty of gambling options downstairs as well.,1,0,1

The pool is apparently closed for good, so we had to walk to the MGM Grand to enjoy some poolside time.  To be honest, I didn't even want to walk on the carpet or use the bathroom.

Overall the hallway and carpets looked a bit dirty, like it was demanding a new paint job and some recarpeting. The room was about as standard and traditional as it gets, and everything looked pretty old for 2014. The room was missing 2 basic things in my opinion: a mini-fridge and wireless internet. Granted fridges are available at an extra cost, but I figured since it was Vegas and hot most of the time, a fridge would be standard. There is actually free wireless in the lobby\/casino areas, however the rooms only provide wired internet service. Again, I figured this would be standard as well.

There was nothing fancy about the room, but they manage to do ever tying really well.  Room service was right at my elbow when my card wouldn't open the door.  

The pool area is nice.  I wouldn't want to be out there on a busy weekend day because in the middle of the week the lounge chairs were totally taken up and there wasn't a lot of space in the pools.  They rent a tube to take around the lazy river for $10, which seemed like a bit of a ripoff.  Drinks and foods are also a ripoff, but it's easy enough to walk 200 feet to the Monte Carlo food court and grab a burger, sandwich, slice of pizza, Chinese food, or fish taco.  Don't even think of bringing any foodstuff back to the pool area.  The TSA agents at the airport have nothing on the people who watch the entrance to the pool.  

The fitness center has enough to keep all but the most serious of exercise enthusiasts happy.  There are 6+ jogging machines, a lots of stationary bicycles, and a elliptical machines.  there are also enough weight machines to keep your shoulders and legs pumped up.

There's a nice monorail that will take guests from the hotel to Aria or The Bellagio.  This makes a big different because there are a plenty of fun places to visit parallel to these places and the sidewalks can be much less than fun on hot days or busy nights.

I do think that it's ridiculous that any state of the art hotel doesn't have free WiFi in this day and age.  Trying to plan my trip was a complete pain in the ass given my iPhone took ages to download even the simplest of pages.",2,1,0

Only had 1 issue where our neighbors blasted music at 330am and when I called down the front desk the lady was so nice and had security sent to deal with the issue promptly. I mean this is no luxury hotel but you aren't paying luxury prices. For what we paid a night it was more than satisfactory. I liked the casino and they had plenty of restaurant options.

We got the rooms somewhere around $80-100 a night, over memorial day weekend. It was our first time in Las Vegas.

The Good:

1) This part will also show up in my ""bad"" section, but we were given two queens our first night, after having reserved a king. The view from the queen room, at the end of a very quiet hallway on the 30th floor, was amazing! So we never asked to be placed in the king we initially asked for. I don't think you'll get a bad view in this hotel if you get a higher level room.

2) There is SO MUCH TO DO in the hotel itself. We had a hard time leaving, actually. So many restaurants, with great variety, as far as type of food, service, and price go. Starbucks for a quick pick-me-up, Sambalatte for a casual latte. McDonalds for a quick fry, The Cafe for an upscale diner-like experience. There's literally everything you'll ever need in this hotel.

3) The pool. We weren't looking for noise, so we sat at the very far left, near the hot tub\/actual pool, and far away from the wave pool. Yes, you can hear the music on the speakers here (""club"" music started at noon every day), but its HALF as quiet (if not more) than sitting elsewhere in the area where the DJ is. We would walk up to get drinks and go, wow, how is it so quiet where we are over there but so loud at the bar?!

4) LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! Monte Carlo is in one of the best spots on the strip, ever. If nothing else, stay here for the location.

The Bad:

1) Yeah, we reserved a king and got a room with two double-beds. They should honor the reservation, but kings are ""first come first serve"" and we checked in at 10pm on a Wednesday night. Nonetheless, they texted us the following day saying our king was available, but we enjoyed our view and room location so much that we didn't bother to switch.

2) When we checked in late, there was food on the floor. Crumbs, ramen noodles dried up near the bed, etc. Very visible. We didn't complain because we figured housekeeping would get it in the morning, but they didn't. So we had to call housekeeping and tell them about the food. After this, they cleaned it up very promptly and our room was always in good condition. You're not getting housekeeping service like you'd get in a Hilton, but we never felt ""dirty"" in our room after that (aside from the food incident).

3) It's not a 5 star. Maybe not even a 4. Yes, the furniture is ""tired"" (I hate this saying) but THE PLACE IS CHEAP! There are some nicks on the furniture, the decor is a little lacking and old, but it was not unpleasant at all.

4) ITS THE YEAR 2014, MAKE WIFI FREE IN EVERY SINGLE ROOM, EVERY SINGLE FLOOR! UP THE TECHNOLOGY - IF I CAN CHECK-OUT FROM MY TELEVISION, I SHOULD GET WIFI.

This should be one of the least filled nights out of the year so plenty of rooms available. And looking at the place, it was pretty empty when we arrived st valet and the check-in line was short. That being said, they still managed to give us the crappiest room possible. It was on a lower floor and right next to our room were several rooms marked ""employees"" which wouldn't be a big deal if we didn't have to hear people working inside really early in the morning! And then looking out the window, there was non-stop construction ALL NIGHT LONG! Good thing I'm a deep sleeper and only woke-up a couple of times to loud back-up lights, but my spouse said there were trucks non-stop coming in\/out due to deliveries, and workers working and yelling. We pretty much stay at all the Mlife hotels and eat\/gamble at the mLife hotels, BUT, we always forget to bring the card. So I guess if you're a nobody (not being mLife tracked with our stays, etc.), this is how you get treated. Believe me, Vegas is NOT my choice for a vacation except maybe once or twice a year but we go 4-6 times a year for sports related events.

So my question is, why did the employee specifically choose this crappy room for us if there are plenty of other rooms available? Was it based on:
1) no mLife card given?
2) paid low price due to low season so give us crappy room? 
3) didn't like the way we appeared?
4) didn't look like we'd complain?

Normally, a hotel would assign a better room than normal because they CAN! Why not show customers your best? I'm not saying give us some fancy suite or upgrade, but rather, at a minimum, a room AWAY FROM CONSTRUCTION AND NOISE. But I guess Vegas is so popular and the employees are just desensitized and could careless. Just looks at how much you paid and are you a regular, is my guess.

The room was fine, we aren't real particular. The hallways have clearly put it with countless people, many of which were probably intoxicated. If having some blemishes in the hallway is going to bother you, than I guess you'll have to pony up probably double the $$ and stay at a newer resort. 
The location was great, the casino was good. The staff were excellent in terms of everything related to our stay. From the gentleman who helped us out of the cab, to the bell desk attendant that brought our bags, to the front desk clerk who checked us in. 
We got in late on a Friday night, it took about 25 minutes to get through the check-in line, it feels like longer, but it wasn't.

Ruined my gfs, makeup bag and both toothbrushes.. and they offered nothing for this, however They were nice enough to switch rooms.

It's been several years since I last stayed at the Monte Carlo, but since it was a pleasant stay then, we thought it would be a pleasant one again now. When I made my reservation I requested to add a note that I would be checking in late as I was expecting to arrive after midnight. When we checked in at 2:30am we were informed that because it was so late, they would have to give my husband and I a room with 2 queens instead of a king (which we were ok with, we were tired from travelling and just wanted to get into our room). The overall check-in process was quick with no issues and the person at the front desk was very pleasant. We got a room on the 15th floor, and as I opened the door I was startled with a large moth flying right to my face. Surprised, I stepped back and my husband proceeded into the room. As he turned on light above the doorway, 2 more large moths started flying in the room. We immediately knew we wanted another room, so I went to turn on the light on the desk to use the phone to call the front desk, and another 2 large moths were sitting on the lampshade! When I called the front desk to let them know there were moths in the room, the first response I received was, ""Ok, I can send housekeeping up there to get rid of them for you."" SERIOUSLY?! I informed her that I did not want that, I wanted a completely new room. She proceeded to find me another room on the 5th floor and transferred our keys, but then said ""I can't guarantee that there won't be moths in that room either, because of the season, guests have been leaving their windows open."" As I was talking with the front desk, my husband was checking around the room and found more moths in between the window curtains. We immediately went to our new room on the 5th floor, and thankfully it was moth free.

We had a Deluxe room, and it appeared pretty dated but the beds were comfortable. There were not many available outlets in the room, and the ones that were available seemed loose. The shower had strong pressure to our liking, but did not drain quickly and I was always standing in ankle deep water by the end of my shower (and I didn't even take long showers). The water also leaked onto the floor when we showered, so we always had to put extra towels down. Our room was cleaned daily, towels & water bottled replaced. Employees we interacted with were very courteous. We also liked the proximity of the convenience shop & food court to the guest elevators. Other than the moth incident, the overall stay was just ok, but I don't think the Monte Carlo will be a first option for us the next time we go to Vegas.",2,2,0

If anything that a five star hotel can do is at least make sure the room is clean.

Downstairs: Valet was prompt and accommodating. The lobby was clean and pretty. Registration was prompt. I asked for a room with morning sun, and none of the three desk reps knew if the room they were giving me would meet my request. (Turns out the room faced north west. Boo.) 

The elevator access from the lobby is easy - and you don't have to trek through the casino. This is a great plus for me. 

Upstairs: The 19th floor was showing it's age. The wall paper was peeling in the hallway, and you could see many patched areas in the wall where they changed the art, but didn't bother taking it any farther. 

Once in the room, it appeared clean and had recently been cleaned. I know this because the carpet was wet. When I called down to inquire if there was anything special I should know (and to quiet my active imagination), the front desk said it was indeed cleaned and should be dry ""by morning."" Huh. Lucky me! 

The bed and pillows were comfortable and clean. The drapes were falling off of the track and the shower curtain rod was coming out of the wall.  Towels were dingy and had several had holes.

I love the comment the other reviewer left about the shower. What is with that spray of needles?! (I'm awake, already, I'm awake!)

Remains of a once luxurious hotel still remain but the rooms could use a little renovation. But here are some pros and cons to staying here;
Pros:
1. Friendly front desk staff who is willing to answer all your questions.
2. Taxi stand moved pretty quick.
3. Convenient tram connecting Monte Carlo to Crystals\/Aria and Bellagio.
4. Close to city center.
5. Next door to a CVS (incase you forgot something or need meds).
6. Nice rooms with updated flat screen tvs and Keurig coffee maker with complimentary coffee and water. 
7. Cleaning staff does a great job cleaning your room and bathroom.
Cons:
1. Cafe service sucks, don't even go there. We went and after waiting over 10 minutes for our waiter to even come say hello we decided to get up and leave. The place was not even busy yet our waiter kept telling us ""I'll be right with you"" and never came. We ended up going to Denny's across the street which was packed yet we were seated in 10 minutes and were immediately helped by our awesome waitress. 
2. No Internet service on my iPhone through my cell phone provider. Monte Carlo has wi-fi which the shamelessly charge 14.99 for 24 hour period.
3. Bathrooms need renovation. Gold fixtures are discolored and rusted. Sink drain smelled like sewage and when you turned off the facet the water going down the drain made too much noise. Sounded like a pluming problem. The shower head was horrible with no good water pressure. It seemed to low so tall people beware. After turning off shower, water still came out of the tub faucet.
4. Walls are paper thin!!! I could clearly hear conversations next door. I was awoken at 5 am but the noisy neighbors next door. There is also a gap underneath the door where noise easily came in. I could also hear conversations going on in the hall. In the bathroom you could also hear people in the bathroom next door. So in other words, noise comes in from all sides of your room.
5. No blow dryers which was ok for me but could be a problem for others.",2,0,0

I've stayed in a number of hotels in Vegas, and we booked this one because of the lazy river and the expected beautiful decor. 

When we got there, we immediately noticed the wonderful aroma that wafted through the hotel. nice. We were pretty sweaty after hiking from the parking garage in the 115 degree Las Vegas weather, and we weren't impressed with their air conditioning. The elevators were downright hot. The check-in was pretty easy and we were given our keys and directions to the room.

Arriving to the room, we weren't impressed. The view was decent...we could see out to the Hard Rock and M&M store, so that was cool, but the room was just meh. 

The longer we stayed, the more we noticed things falling apart. Our sink wasn't draining, the iron was missing from the closet, and there were about 15 escort business cards in the drawer next to the bible. We called down to the front desk to ask about wifi, and we were told that they didn't have it. They told us that there was a plug in the room, but it seemed that someone had taken that, too. And we learned later that it wouldn't have worked for a Macbook Air anyway. ugh

When we went down to the pool, it was really crowded. One of the pools was way too warm to be comfortable in 115 degree Vegas heat. The ""lazy river"" that we were looking forward to was a circle...really not impressive at all.

One of the days, we went to the buffet and paid for endless mimosas. Every time we looked around for our waiter to refill our mimosas, he was nowhere to be found. But eventually, we would track him down. When we waved him down for our fourth round, he gave us a dirty look. He was really rude.

All in all, it was just an average hotel. I can't say that I will be staying here again. There are for better places to stay on the strip that have better amenities and better decor.",0,0,0

My wife and I booked at the Monte Carlo because the price was right and it had a four star rating. Sadly, we walked through some of the other casinos that were awarded 5 star ratings (Bellagio, Ceasar's Palace, etc.), and it doesn't seem fair to award the Monte Carlo a 4 star rating by comparison.

THE BAD NEWS:

The rooms weren't special at all; with the peeling wallpaper, ruffled carpets and worn interior it felt more like a Holiday Inn than a luxury resort on The Strip. The casino area wasn't great either. It hardly ever seemed like the place to be to lose all your money at.

The pool area was lively and entertaining, but there were still some soft spots: (1) there were all these roped off hutchs and pool beds marked ""Reserved"" or ""VIP"", but no one was ever in them... kinda a bummer us not very important people couldn't use them. (2) They charged a whopping $10 for the floating tubes, and as a result the lazy river was filled more hardworking people that stood in it drinking beer and fighting the current. (3) The ""wave"" pool gently swished back and forth for about 3 minutes before shutting off for at least 10 minutes... it was so boring that even the creepy weirdos that would normally indulge in frottage stayed away. (4) Drinks by the pool were ridiculously priced and you can't bring in drinks from the other bars at the resort.

THE GOOD NEWS:

The staff were all amazing. We felt very taken care of there. The casino is relatively central on The Strip with it being just north of New York New York and just south of the Aria. And as I said before, we couldn't beat the price of this place.

ADDED BONUS:

The Blue Man Group performs here. I HIGHLY recommend you see this show. It was wildly entertaining and hilarious.",5,0,1

We checked in at 2am after a delayed flight, however I called to confirm that we would be showing up.

1.  They gave away one of our rooms that was a double (we explicitly reserved a double)

2.  They assigned us rooms that were filthy.  Urine on the toilet seats and used towels everywhere.

3.  We complained.  They ""upgraded us"" to strip view rooms on a higher floor.  These rooms also had the previous guests urine on the toilet seat and one of them reeked of some kind of curry or body odor.

4.  We complained again.  I insisted on speaking to the manager who then talked down to me because ""I was being too aggressive and threw my phone at him"" to show the pictures of the dirty bathroom.

Mind you it was about 4am by this time.  I didn't throw the phone but it did fall from the counter into his computer area because I wanted him to see the filth.

5.  We moved again.  One room was a suite the other a double that faced floodlights on the outside.  

This place is a disgrace.  Avoid at all costs.  See my picture and judge for yourself.

BUT, we're talking some sloppy housekeeping. not only was there a double fist sized rip in our top sheet, but i had to tuck in the bottom sheet on both the top and bottom of the mattress before lullaby time! seriously, the mattress pad was exposed, and it's not like i'd been having a party all over the bed that would have caused this. 

excellent water pressure. toilet had eerily powerful flush which pleased the mister to no end. 

casino itself and halls in hotel smelled of powder--kind of like a talcum version of tea rose. not my thing. i mean, it's not like the monte carlo could possibly know that my mother wore tea rose perfume and that any time i smell it, i am reminded of her in the most proustian of ways (i say this having failed on multiple occasions to successfully read any proust), which is generally not a good thing, but there you have it. a casino that attempts to cover up ashes with rose powder. 

nice to have access to a starbucks within the hotel off the lobby. 

check in and out was super easy. 

honestly, had the bed not had the ripped sheet and been made a bit tighter, i would have given the monte carlo 4 stars, but as it is, i just can't. princess wants a tidily made bed...

Well I got a very good rate due to the casino card. I was staying for a week and wanted get an upgrade to the Hotel 32 as it was long stay but unfortunately they don't have 2 beds in Hotel 32. I was initially given a room on the 4th floor facing the pool and guess what with all the pool party craze its not a good idea to face the pool and be on a lower floor as the music plays nonstop till 5-6PM. I was fortunate enough to have me moved to a higher floor. The rooms are clean but do need a revamp. The location is the reason I picked this hotel as it is dead central. The Food court is interesting as they have a whole bunch of chain places there. There is a Starbucks to you can get free WiFi if you want. Now for the restaurants I only tried out the Pub as it was the Basket Ball Playoffs. Like most places the drinks are expensive here and mojitos are ho hum. The beer selection is quite extensive. I enjoyed a pint here several times as it does get busy and the bar tenders are not very talkative and are quite busy. The pool is quite nice as they have wave pool and lazy river so its a good way to pass time. The place can get loud. There is a nice sandy beach volley ball area though not many people seem to enjoy it. The good part is you are connected via mono rail to Bellagio.

I decided to book a room at the Monte Carlos hours before I was set to arrive and was pleasantly surprised. The rate beat that of the rooms listed on the Hotel Tonight app and came with 2 free buffets. 

The room was pretty basic but clean and welcoming. I got a room with 2 queen beds even though it was only me and had a room facing the pool. The room didn't smell like smoke and the water pressure was fine. One of the elevators was out of order for my entire 3 night stay but I never had to wait long for a lift. All of the staff here were incredibly friendly. 

I checked out the pool one afternoon at about 2 pm. I inquired about renting a day bed and they said it was $200 for the bed but that $200 was but towards food and drink. Since it was just me for the afternoon that was a little more than I wanted to spend and declined. The guy said that they usually dropped prices at 3pm and since they had 2 day beds sitting open he would drop it down to $150 for me right then. I thought about it but still declined. He told me he could do it for $100. Sold! I got a day bed all to myself for a food and beverage credit of $100 which was easy to meet. The pool was awesome- not too many kids, not too many bros and not annoyingly loud. I also got a free tube for the lazy river and floated around a bit. I might come back to this hotel just for the day bed. 

The other great perk about this place is the Blue Man Group parade that winds through the casino. It's a great way to spend about 10-15 minutes if you catch the end of the parade near the opening of the Blue Man Group Theater.

I arrived on April 17th 2015 and checked out completely unsatisfied on April 19th 2015. Upon arrival and getting to my room, I decided to take a shower. I turned the water on and the hottest the water would get was luke warm at best! The shower water pressure was so low that I had to scrub my body just to get the soap off. This was a problem my entire weekend stay. 

I then wanted to brush my teeth and the water pressure for the sink was very strong however within 11 seconds of being on, the sink was overflowing with water. I have attached a picture of this for you to see. Not only was this bad, but the left over hair that was stuck in the drain came out and floated in the sink! Utterly disgusting!

I then walked over to the bed and turned the TV on. I would say 50 percent of the channels worked without having some static waves. I have attached another picture showing how bad some of the channels were! 

Then I noticed I could not hook up to any WIFI and was told by front desk people that WIFI is only for guests in suites and above! A major hotel on the Las Vegas strip doesn't have WIFI???? You should really inform guests prior to arrival that you do not provide WIFI for people getting normal rooms. 

This as you can see was not a very good start for my first hour at your casino. Does anyone do an inspection before new guests arrive??? 

While sleeping that night, the clock radio on the night stand kept going off! I was awoken 8 times during the night and could not turn that old clock off! I even unplugged it and it kept going off! 

While playing in the casino I was supposed to have $40.00 in freeplay on my player's card. I went to activate it at the Mlife desk and they told me it was good to go. I went to a slot machine to use it and it would not work. I went back to the desk again and told them and they said ok it should work now. I walked again to a machine and it did not work!!!!! I walked back to the Mlife desk and the girl asked me to show her, so again I walked to a machine and she said ""thats funny"" and we had to walk back again so that she could fix it. How many times do I have to walk around to use $40.00 in freeplay!!

As you can see my entire stay at your casino was not a pleasant one and I am requesting a full refund on all my charges during that weekend. I appreciate your time looking into this matter. 

THIN WALLS THIN WALLS, I could hear everything the room next to me was talking about.",1,2,1

That is comparing apples to oranges. Of COURSE Bellago is nicer, it costs 2-4 times as much.  That's like saying Denny's sucks because Lawry's has way better food.  You need to re-align your expectations if you are expecting the Bellagio when you stay at Monte Carlo. If you are looking for the 20-something wild club scene, this is also not the hotel for you. Do some research.  

Now, that said, for the price it is great. I have been staying here exclusively for 3 years ever since my last nightmare stay at a TR property, and I have been very happy. Yes, things go wrong, but this is a huge hotel with thousands of guests moving through everyday. Cut them some slack. You are human too. 

I don't know why everyone is complaining about wi-fi not working in the rooms. They don't even OFFER free wi-fi in the rooms. Only the first floor, though I have stayed as high as 8th and got it to work. They offer free wired internet in the rooms, but no wi-fi.  

I have never found rooms to be dirty. Worn, yes, in need of updating, maybe. But filthy? No. The water pressure is a problem at every huge high rise hotel in Vegas, and everywhere else I have ever stayed in one. 

The pool is our absolute favorite of any Las Vegas hotel. Other than the one day it has a pounding DJ and wet bikini contests, it is a mellow, quiet, safe-feeling atmosphere. I love the lazy river and the wave pool, and I have never had a problem getting a chair in the sun or shade.  Wait service is good if you treat them well, and the only one time I saw any misbehavior security was on TOP of it big time (it was just someone who had way too much to drink and was endangering herself by being in the pool, nothing big).  I think this hotel does tend to attract families because of the pool as there are always kids in it, but I have never felt like it was overrun with kids, nor an inappropriate environment for when I do have my kids with me (which is rare). 

Admittedly, we don't eat on-property much, we tend to go to other resorts for dining but not because there is anything wrong with MC's food, we just try to brand out and try new things and MC has not had the widest array of choices. Now there are more with the new openings so we may have to try Yusho on our trip this month. 

Valet has always been fast and we use it every time we stay. I like to park once and cab\/walk for the whole trip so we don't have to worry about drinking. I also have used the new express\/early VIP check-in and it was great. One room of our two was ready by 10am, the other wasn't but they quickly found one that was and we were on our way to the pool less than 20 minutes later. Yes, the line for check-in is long at 3pm on a Friday - it moves very fast and you should see the line at Bellagio if you want to compare! Yikes!! 

On our last two trips this year, the casino air was the cleanest it has even been. I did not need my asthma meds once, and not one time did I end up at table with anyone smoking. The air actually seemed pretty darned clean for a casino. 

One thing I really do like about Monte Carlo is that it is not enormous and the elevators to the rooms are placed very close to check-in and valet\/parking as well as the pool and the tram to Bellagio. I hate nothing more than having to walk half a mile just to get to my room, through a crowded casino, carrying luggage. 

Monte Carlo is also a good less expensive place to stay if you don't plan on spending any time in your room but just want an inexpensive, quiet, convenient place to crash, hit the spa and relax at the pool, while you do your partying elsewhere.

As for the comment about only ""overweight middle-aged White people, and frugal Asians"" staying here, that is disgusting and wrong. You've clearly never been to the pool mid-day. Yes, it is a quieter hotel, not a party scene, but that comment is really ugly. Sheesh!",14,3,4

As an M Life member and avid MyVegas player I was very excited to try out their Buffet since I had 2 complimentary meals for their breakfast and dinner buffet. 

The pricing for the buffet is certainly affordable:
$17.99 for breakfast
$20.99 for lunch
$24.99 for dinner
$34.99 for an all-day pass
$17 to-go option 

I suppose you could say that the pricing is indicative of the quality. The food was underwhelming and very limited for a buffet. The meats were way too dry and salty, the soups too thick and tasteless, and the desserts left something to be desired.

If you're looking to eat high quantity and don't mind the taste then this is for you. Otherwise I would skip this buffet and just eat at the food court for a better meal at a much lower price.",0,0,0

The prices you pay is really the quality and service you get. So don't be disappointed if you don't expect the best services. There's no reception whatsoever in the rooms. You'll be lucky getting a bar or two. I got my deal from a 3rd party website, paid for 4 days, 3 nights, 2 flights for about $750. The resort fee per day is about $25. 

Rooms: Stayed on the 8th floor, 2nd to last room to the end of the hallway. Yes, it was a bit of a walk.  The hotel is quite small compared to some around. 

Casino: The casino here is empty.  You look around and not a lot are playing.  

Food: There is a small food court with Starbucks, Sbarro, McDonalds, and a few others. They have some buffets and some other restaurants located at the front (near the strip side). 

Spa: Came here for the first time and got a spa treatment. This was my first time getting a spa and massage.  It's one of the cheaper spas around the strip.  The relaxation package is $138 per person which includes gratuity.  

Pool: They have 2 big pools. A lot of chairs for you to relax and sunbathe.  During my stay, I was at the pool side soaking up some sun.  They do have a wave pool, lazy river, and a pool.  

Tram: They have a nice tram service from Monte Carlo to Bellagio.  You walk through the street of dreams and it will take you to Aria or if you wish you can take the tram to Crystals (Aria) or Bellagio. It sucks that it doesn't stop at The Cosmopolitan, because it's inbetween Aria and Bellagio.  You'll have to get off of Aria and walk out, it's a total separate building by itself.",0,0,1

The lines to check in are horrendous. The swimming pools are gone. They'll shuttle you to the Mandalay Bay pools but the shuttle only runs a few hours morning and then late afternoon, so realistically you're going to be at the pool all day -- packed with people, no chairs available, no shade. The Monte Carlo lobby is walled off for construction. Many of the shops are gone; the steak house is gone. Upstairs, the room drapes are shabby, bathroom floor tiles are loose, drippy fixtures circa mid 90s, and lots of stains on the room carpet. To get a plug to charge your mobile device, you're left to dig behind the bed. A\/C doesn't seem to be working in the hallways. One of the elevators was out of service and the video monitors in others were showing the blue screen of death with ""reboot Windows XL."" Oh my. And of course, like so many other hotels on the strip, parking isn't free anymore. To their credit, the staff we dealt with were all friendly and helpful, but the facilities are in bad shape. Monte Carlo is going to be rebranded and the M-C name is going to be retired so there's no investment happening here. It's obvious the company is just keeping the lights on long enough to prep for gutting the rooms and then re-booting the whole place.

We flew in this past Sunday night for a mother and daughter trip. We arrived at the hotel around 11pm, the check in was only 3 people deep in line, but took almost an hour to check in. They didn't have the queen room we reserved, they only had a king bed left. Liz was nice to waive the fee for the resort for that night and gave us a roll way bed for no charge.

The appearance of the room was fine, but the bathroom really needs to be updated. The shower had hair on the side and the door handle in the bathroom was broken and just hanging. The next morning i called from the room and ask if our room was ready to change, he said not yet and confirmed my phone number and said they will text me when its ready. 6 hours later, no text. We were out and about, so again not that big of a deal. When i went to the front desk to see if our room was ready yet, the desk said  it's been ready. I asked why I didn't get a text and he said he didn't know. I told him about the bathroom door and he seems to think that's normal.

We found a deal that basically ended up being $173 per person ( 2 girls to a room,after hotel fees) for a 3 night stay. Not bad for about $57\/night to have your own bed and decent bathroom. Our drain was a little slow, but nothing so bad that we needed to complain. In our other room however, the shower head produced a super intense water pressure that literally, physically hurt my friends. Luckily, all it took was one call to get hotel service up in the room to change out the shower head into an amazing, adjustable one.

House keeping was on-time and on top of it. No complaints there. Rooms were basic and clean. My only complaint is that the Expedia website says free high speed internet in each room, but as that turns out, it doesn't mean wifi. The plug they have for in-room high speed internet is so out of date, that it wouldn't fit into the outlet in my Sony Ultrabook. My roommate ended up going downstairs for wifi to use her iPad whenever she needed internet. Kinda lame for 2013.

There was a club downstairs called Brand, I believe. On Saturday, we came back around 1:30am from Surrender, and a Monte Carlo promoter stopped us and told us to check out Brand. He said it was $20 for ""UNLIMITED"" drinks all night. Kinda crazy how we paid no entrance fee  for  the bigger\/ more happening clubs like Marquee and Surrender, but we figured well....unlimited drinks....what the heck? Why not? After we paid we were given TWO drink tickets. Lame. Misrepresentation at its best. 

Still, the stay itself wasn't bad and you get one free buffet per person for every day you stay there. That's a perk if you're too hungover in the morning to go out  or just need some food before you head out for the night. Would recommend for penny-pinchers looking for the basics. Would also recommend you avoid their ""club\/lounge"" and be on notice about no wifi in the rooms\/ no internet in the rooms if you have a newer laptop\/device that won't fit an old school internet cable.",0,0,0

We usually call around in advance to the nicer hotels on the Strip and book the cheapest one. We have stayed at Bally's, the Monte Carlo, MGM Grand, NY NY, and the Luxor. I don't think we have ever paid more than $150 a night, even on a weekend night.

About a month ago, some friends of ours decided to get married in Vegas and asked us to come along to help them celebrate. Our joining them was kind of a spur-of-the-moment deal (about two weeks from our arrival there), and there was a HUGE convention going on in LV that weekend, so almost everything was completely booked - and hideously expensive. Even the Casino Royale, which definitely does not qualify as a ""nice"" hotel, was running $150\/night. The cheapest rate I could find other than the Casino Royale was at the Monte Carlo, which ran us $550 for two nights. Gack. However, I had read on this site that somebody had been robbed recently at the Casino Royale, so I swallowed hard and booked the Monte Carlo. We were there from Oct 13-15.

The hotel is very nice. The lobby is spacious and impressive (although not even close to as impressive as, say, the lobby of the Bellagio). Check-in was a little lame - there was a LONG wait on a Friday afternoon, which I imagine to be a pretty popular time to arrive in Las Vegas. The hotel is pretty centrally located on the Strip, which is a huge plus for us because we never rent a car when we go. Our room was clean and attractive, with marble in the bathroom and a bed that was more comfortable than average. It also had an in-room safe, which I liked. However, the towels - and the WALLS - were painfully thin. The towels were thinner than the old junk towels we keep around to dry off our dog when it's raining. As for the walls, this normally wouldn't be a problem for me, as I am a heavy sleeper, but for an average of $275\/night, I expect to be *pampered*. And to be able to hang out in my hotel room without having to hear the people in the next room coughing.

Two other things that I thought were plusses which others might not - there is a food court in the hotel that offers crappy (and cheapish) fast food (like McDonald's, Sbarro's, Nathan's, and Starbucks). I would normally not be the least bit excited about McDonald's, but I have to admit that it's a little refreshing now that Vegas has gotten so horribly expensive to be able to buy a cheap meal. I had at least one meal there that cost less than the ""service fee"" for the ATM in the lobby (which was $4). They also have probably the biggest and best ""Everything's $10"" store (only it really has some fancy French name - Bijoux something) I have ever seen. So those were good things.

Overall, I would definitely stay here again, but I wasn't impressed for the price. So if you're headed that way, be sure to book early! And you may want to bring your own towels, too.",2,3,1

This place is kind of a let down. It's a bit outdated and old. There's old carpet everywhere that needs cleaning and it just feels old. 

Our room was average, and a bit dirty. The shower was cramped, small and narrow. The shower head leaked a lot, and so the water was always running and we couldn't turn it off fully. The shower spray was also poor because no matter how hard you tried to close the shower curtain, it seemed to always spray outside the shower, leaving the floor wet. 

Also, the clock radio in our room was broken. It wouldn't play any sound. We called and they gave us a new one, but they didn't even take the old one away to repair. The new one was a different model and with both on the nightstand, took up too much room.

We had a view of the back of NY NY, and the parking lot -- they called it the Mountain View. It's fine; I don't care that much about the view, but thought that was kinda funny. You could see the faint mountains a bit.

The wave pool was super small and dinky. The waves were very small, and the pool was small. Also, they don't allow tubes or floats in the wave pool, so that kinda sucked. Of course, there's not outside food or drinks in the pool area, so be prepared for that. They will check bags. A plastic water bottle is apparently allowed though.

The wave pool was OK. It's more fun than a pool, and we brought our own tube with us, but the pool was filled with lots of drunk middle aged people who were standing around at one spot of the river, smoking and spilling drinks, and cluttering up the flow. Every time you went around, it was dreadful to try and make it through the narrow passageway to get by them. It was a constant, gross bottleneck. People shouldn't be allowed to permanently loiter in there while smoking and getting ash in the river. Kinda gross. 

The pool was in the shade and was freezing, so we didn't go in there. Unfortunately the hotel and others nearby create huge shadows in the pool area, and actually made it too cold in some spots. I didn't expect that in Vegas, but be warned. The hot tub was alright.

The location is OK. It's across from M&M World, and Coca Cola, but it's kinda far from the main hub of the strip. 

I stayed here because I wanted a great pool, but I'm not sure I would come back for that as it was a let down. If I found a decent price, I'd prefer to stay at Mandalay Bay for their pool facilities, or Flamingo for their water slide, great location and cheap rates. I'm not convinced I'd come back here.

The façade is nice; the restaurants that face the boulevard are very updated and the check-in area is also pretty, everything else is subpar. 

We received one of the worst rooms possible, the lowest floor, very end of the hallway and facing the construction. My guess is that hotels like this probably renovate rooms from the top to bottom so perhaps this room just hasn't been touched yet but it was like being in a cheap hotel in the 90s. Dingy carpet, ugly gold fixtures, mold in the shower, cheap and crappy everything. I have stayed at a wide range of Vegas hotels in the past so I thought I knew the quality I was getting but it was worse than I expected. I would stay at the Flamingo many times before ever staying here again...

The silver lining is that I was only staying for one night and this was a good way to confirm that I am a North end of the strip kind of girl, Cosmo\/Planet Hollywood is my limit.

If you do stay here - do ask for a room without construction views since they are making CityCenter adjacent to the Monte Carlo. I was lucky enough to get a room facing New York, New York - kind of reminded me of home.

There isn't a huge theme with the Monte Carlo unlike all the newer hotels  in town, (ie: Bellagio, Venetian, Caesar's Palace, etc...etc). It feels like any other hotel, it might as well be called Las Vegas Sheraton - it seems just average.

Stayed here around the mid 90s when it was first built and totally loved it and thought I would come here again with the family. Unfortunately, it was a total unpleasant awakening literally while staying here in terms of sight, sound, and price.

After having heard about the parking fees enacted from the MGM casinos, I knew there would be the parking fee. And a few years back, we all knew just about all the strip hotels were charging the resort fee. And after staying at other MGM hotels, the resort fee tax is also mandatory. What I didn't know was this new Room tax of $6.  I feel there is lots of nickel and diming the customers whenever it's possible. 

2016-12-21 MC Room Tax - 12% 6.00

2016-12-21 MC Resort Fee 30.00

2016-12-21 MC Resort Fee Tax -12% 3.60

2016-12-21 MC Guest Overnight Parking 8.00

Case and point: My rooms were free but apparently when the lady at the counter asked me if I wanted a high floor room, it would be $5 more. Why? Why are you charging me $5 extra on a weekday when you are redoing a major renovation to the New Park MGM? Why would you like to inconvenience your customers for more money?  I totally don't understand?

Perhaps I don't speak of greed? 

I mean, our room is already pretty shot from the tub that doesn't drain, the wall paper that's already peeling, the thin walls which we heard our neighbor the whole night whenever they go to the bathroom, and the mismatch accents your leaky bathroom has that cause us to have sleepless nights here? 

But you would still like to charge us more? 

Sure you say you have sleeping amenities for hotel guests but for the media person reading this review, would you understand my frustration? Come and stay a night for yourself facing the construction for yourself and check in at 9pm with your own credit card and perhaps you'll understand. So please don't respond to me with a ""I'm sorry, we'll do better.""  Just make sure if you have customers, try and put them in rooms as far away from sound and if you are going to charge them, make sure you're giving them 100%, otherwise the new Park MGM is not going to make it.",16,4,3

I took the tram to Aria to check out their tables and slots every night. My next issue is the wifi (floors 1-3) yet it was included in the hotel amenities charge.  No wifi in floor 30 where we were located.  Also when we checked out, we thought printing the boarding pass was included in the amenities fee but it still asked for a credit card.

Good:
-Convenient location
-They allowed us to check in early and accomodated the request to have all of our party stay on the same floor
-The cafe downstairs has a $1.99 breakfast deal after midnight
-The hotel fee includes the use of the spa facilities for $5
-You can print your boarding passes downstairs
-The pool area has a daily drink special for $5 per drink.  Other than that, the drinks are over $12 per pop
Bad:
-The pool area sucks.  The chairs are dirty, the wave pool is cold and the lazy river will cost you $12.95 per tube.  Also, don't order the cheviche cuz its made with ketchup and comes with hard chips.
-Virtually no night life in the hotel
-Very limited food selection
-The towels in the rooms are rough and scratched my face
-The room decor is outdated and the tv has limited channels
-The quality of the products provided in the room (ie shampoo, lotion) is very low.  The body wash doesnt lather and the lotion does not absorb into your skin.

My girl and I and friends always stay at the Monte Carlo Resort.  It's right on the strip and the rooms are at VERY reasonable rates.  If you have a Player's Club Card it's even better....
So my gf got me a trip to Vegas for my B-day\/Graduation celebration.  We had the plane tickets purchased, and the weekend planned.  However, we did not book our room yet.  We were pretty sure that we were going to stay at the Monte Carlo-- but wanted to look around a little bit-- just to mix it up.  Again, rates were reasonable we were just seeking something different.  We were looking at rooms about 4 weeks before our trip... and still didn't book because we had plenty of time.  The following Monday on my way to work I heard the announcement of the I (HEART) radio concert... SAME WEEKEND... To our demise our rates tripled.  
My gf called the Monte Carlo on that MONDAY and tried to book-- however it was at the much higher rate.  This is where having a Player's Club card mattered.  Gf said, ""Well I have a Player's Club card there, and I was going to book my room this weekend.  I had no idea that the concert was going to be announced.""  Immediately the person on the other end of the phone sent her up to VIP.  The guy addressed her by Ms. (last name) and booked the room for the ""original"" rate that we found.  
The GF was VERY pleased.... as was I.  
Besides being a Hotel on the Strip with great rates they have a Wave Pool, Regular Pool, Jacuzzi, and Lazy River.  The casino downstairs is fun too... I usually end up winning or at least breaking even.  We look forward to our next stay.

I have experienced the casino quite a few times and I have seen one of the rooms as well. So, I think I have a good idea of the casino and can truthfully review it in full capacity.

As for the casino itself - a solid 3 stars. Is it grand? No. Is it a crap-hole? No. It's an all right casino floor and it comes with a skanky party pit where half naked girls dance post 5 PM. 

Directly off the casino floor is a food court - easy to find. The food court has a Rubio's, which is basically awesome (for me anyway) and the other typical fast-food places. There's also an area of shopping, and located in this area is The Pub, a place I have not tried, but have been tempted to. There are few restaurants. Honestly the only one I can say I have been in is the Italian place (can't recall the name). They put on a nice banquet at the event I caught the tail end of and the servers were polite and patient.

The rooms? Better than some strip properties I've seen, but definitely not ranking too high up there. It's a moderately decent room, with the basic amenities. I have not seen their suites, so I cannot comment.

The parking situation is all right. I have had no problem finding the garage, which is located behind the casino, but some might have some issues if they've never been to the Monte Carlo before. Best thing to do is to get a spot on the floor the has the walkway into the casino. This plops you right down into the hotel's front desk area.

It is understandable that they don't let you bring in a cooler of booze, but they made me pore out a fresh cup of coffee I had just bought from the Starbuks next to the pool entrance. The room was nice, spacious and clean. Perfect location on the main strip.

BIG COMPLAINT is the billing. I booked the trip through Expedia. About 2 weeks after the trip, there was random Front Desk fee's totaling $500 on my credit card. When I called to inquire about the fee's they told me ""their system had crashed"". Gave my phone number and nobody has called back. Requested and email with my receipt and still waiting. I knew there would be resort fee's of about $30\/day for two people. But the rest of the charges are unaccounted for. There is something crooked going on here. My advice request a receipt upon checking out to avoid this B.S.",0,0,0

The hotel was surprisingly packed checking in around 10pm. 
As soon as we got to the room, it was decent and seemingly clean but definitely old and worn. (old furniture, carpet stains etc)
I immediately checked the beds and there was a nasty brown stain near the foot of the bed. Luckily on our way to the room we passed a housekeeping cart so hubby asked for new sheets. (which also had faded stains, but way better than the brown stuff)
The bathroom was ok, water pressure fine, clean to not be grossed out, but def. not soaking in the tub clean. The towels were dingy and had holes. But hey I paid under $100! (I wouldn't pay over that)
Great location on the strip! By NY NY, MGM, planet hollywood, Aria etc. There's a tram to bellagio\/ aria which is a plus. 
If you park on the 2nd floor, you can go directly to hotel entrance faster. However, if you have a stroller you have to take the elevator back down. The elevator from parking garage is tiny so you might have to wait for it to go back. I like that you don't have to go through the casino to get to your room (toddler in mind) There's a food court (which we didn't try) 
Walls are a bit thin + VERY loud neighbors, coming back from clubbing and partying in the room until 6am (could hear their entire conversation, including a fight) Next morning baby was up so WE made a lot of noise (knowing said neighbors were probably sleeping lol) It was too cold for the pool, but heard it has a lazy river.
This would not be my first choice unless you are on a budget and want to be on the strip.",0,0,0

And the lazy river isn't part of the resort fee, and you have to buy a tube. Food is horribly overpriced, and we quickly filled the tiny trash in the room with food wrappers from the grocery store. No fridge in room either, but bring an ice chest (free ice).

On our recent stay we had to move rooms three different times in four nights.

The next room we had to put up with screaming and yelling most of the night from the room next door, which is the 2nd stay we had noise issues late night.

Absolutely professional, beyond courteous, an exceptional person. Monte Carlo Management; take note, she's a keeper and should be promoted. Now onto the review of the hotel and our suite. Look, your rooms are beat up. I'm going to tell you straight up, you're falling behind. I've stayed in 19 Hotel\/Casinos in Vegas so far, and my goal is to stay at all of them on the strip. So far MGM resorts are coming up short in several ways. First off, there is a $13.00 charge for Valet services. Wrong answer. I tip generously because I appreciate the work these young men and women do.....running in the desert heat to park and retrieve patrons cars....but charging a fee on top of a tip, unheard of. If you think you're setting a new precedence I think you're mistaken. It's just one more reason for me to keep going to Caesars\/Total Rewards Resorts. Back to the rooms. The room was neat and clean, but the furniture is damaged, carpets heavily stained, and walls scratched and left in a state of disrepair. When I stayed at competitor resorts, no such damage or deficiencies. Additionally, who closes their cafe at 11 PM??!!  Other casinos offer 24 hour full service dining options. Keep in mind this isn't my first time staying here. I thought I'd give it another shot but the differences in quality is blatantly obvious. I've attached photos so potential customers can have a first hand look, and they can also see my review of Harrah's, Linq, and Caesars to make the comparison. I think they'll be able to see the difference. The casino was nice, no complaints. The cocktail waitress seemed like she was either stoned or drunk, and that's an honest assessment. Not that she was rude, on the contrary, she was funny, engaging, but fucked up on something. All in all, MGM needs to reconsider some of the recent changes, renovate or at least repair their suites. Until then I'm going where I know I'll get what I paid for and have many more options available without getting nickel and dimed along the way for services your competitors include in their resort fees.",0,0,0

Cheap motels in third world countries provide in room wifi and usually the price is included in the room fee.   Here they charge you 20 dollar per day for wired internet and it's  MANDATORY god knows why.  

When we first got here the line up for checking in was so long that I took a nap and still find it being endless.
Finally got that done and after agreeing to pay your 20 dollar room charge; you would be disappointed for thinking Ok no wifi and they charge that much the room must be nice or something must be good. 
Wrong!.  The room looked like they were renovated in the 80s. I would say its spacious but walls are paper thin being able to hear every convo next door makes. Theres an old air con\/fan that made screeching noises every 2 minutes so it was useless.  The blankets are paper thin too and I caught a cold during my third nights stay.  The bathtub is so shallow and short that I gave up trying to take a bath in there. (I'm only 5'9"") TV has very limited channels compare to what they play on the big screens in their casino.

 I confronted the staff that I had wifi signal in the room the first night of my stay.  But no more after the first night.  She told me I was ""being very lucky"" because only the lobby and second floor have the signal. 

I didn't even wanna argue with her at that point.  It is sad that a 4 star hotel management team told me I was lucky to be able to use a service I paid for everyday. It was clear that they were constructing part of the hotel and maybe rebuilding the wifi. Well people don't charge your guest if the service is not ready.... 

Overall I had to say this place ruined my first time Vegas experience.  There's plenty of places to go that will provide you free wifi and nicer rooms.

Oh yeah gotta add this.  now I'm waiting in line again for over 20 minutes to check out.

It's clean, reasonably priced and is close to many of the places you'd want to visit but may not want to spend an extra $100+\/night to stay at.  We paid $66 for Christmas eve for a room with a view of the City Center, which is what we wanted to see in the first place.  

The Monte is clean, comfortable and the staff are friendly.  The main gripe I have is the $10\/day ""resort fee.""  As other have mentioned, you get access to the exercise equipment, a newspaper and two small bottles of water, oh, and local and 800# phone calls.  What a joke, but I guess many businesses are trying to find ways to add nickels and dimes to the bottom line.  Even with the resort fee, the rate was much lower than anything in that area.  Also, the parking is a breeze.

As a previous poster mentioned, they had problems with the computer system with means people need to wait a long time to get paid if they want to cash out their winnings at the machines.  Also, it affected the check in on Christmas day.  I couldn't express check out so I stood in line for 40 minutes (only two parties ahead of me).  I hope they got that fixed, because it would be a disaster in the evening for check ins.

I really thought that we'd be put together, since you know.. we're a corporation. But we were scattered through out the hotel. 

We were placed on the 20th floor, which apparently entitled us to something that the lower floors didn't get... turn down service. I checked with friends who were on the 8th floor and they didn't get that from house keeping, but we got it every night, and the first time, it scared the husbeast - he tends to be a touch paranoid- not that I blame him. 

Our room was nice, if plain, there was nothing terribly breathtaking about it. We over looked the interstate and the construction work being done at New York, New York. It didn't bother us at all, as we barely heard anything - barely noticed the construction as we weren't in the rooms much during the day.  The bed was quite comfortable, but the toilet ran all the time. I think it acted like white noise for us, blocking out the extraneous sounds at night.

The lobby can be quite confusing with it's arms that wheel off into all directions, the parking garage has plenty of parking, and the Valet is quite handy.

Overall the hotel is still clean and nice, and the rooms are really decent. All the services here are up to par - housekeeping is friendly and concierge people are also quite friendly.

One complaint was the air ventilation in the room was pretty bad..it was busting out cold air even though our temperature was set to 70degrees. Pretty annoying.

I have to admit though, the blackjack dealers here are pretty awesome. Look out for Mariola or Carole Ann, and mention that you heard about them via Yelp =D They usually work the 8-4am shift and at the $5 or $10 tables. They are super friendly and hilarious, and will leave you entertained for hours into the wee morning.

Overall, I wouldn't mind staying here again, especially for the price, but I do think there are many nicer options these days...this is simply a great alternative if you're looking for a decent place on a budget.

There was no fridge, microwave or coffee machine, boo. I also hated the body wash and shampoo they had, it made my skin and hair super dry. 

Anyways, we stayed on the 7th floor not too close to the elevator and sound wasn't an issue.

I travel to Vegas often for work and for fun.  
Couples get aways, WCC tourney and girl trips....so been a few places.
Not an expert but maybe my info can help someone out.  I always do reviews before I travel to see the most up to date info.

Review is for our family of 4 doing a long weekend getaway July 3-6.
Girls are 13 and 10.  Pretty mature for their ages, love to travel....we knew kids in Vegas was going to be a bit tricky so a little more planning on this one.  

I've stayed at many hotels and admit I'm getting spoiled.  Monte Carlo came to be not because it rivals the Bellagio dripping in luxury (seriously go VIP at the Bellagio, it rocks.) BUT I needed a good location and most important a really great pool for the kids.  Monte Carlo does it right in the pool area.

Check in: Don't fear the line, they move it well.  It was a breeze and everyone was very friendly.   I've never tried the $20 sandwich trick or even just bribing for an upgrade but I was talking about how happy I was to finally get to the hotel after a 3hr flight delay and as we wrapped up he upgraded me to a higher floor.  Very nice.  I tipped just because he was so nice to work with and that was a great gesture after long travel. 

Room: Good, not great.  I've seen some pics from other reviewers and I knew what to expect.  Amenities are fine, space is fine.  My only issue is the beds and pillows.  I can't get a good night sleep here.  On the firm side which I don't normally mind, but just...not good.  Housekeeping ladies are awesome.  Monte Carlo gets a HUGE Plus for having in room coffee and 2 bottle waters daily.  Wifi isn't great though and I have Verizon....only get one bar in the room.  Busy holiday weekend and we didn't even experience any noise from other guests.

Dining: You can see the list of what they have but I can say when you need to get something relatively inexpensive, it doesn't get any better.  Of course McD and Subway prices are a bit jacked up but I also didn't hike\/drive to get to them.  Great range of dining in the hotel  Before the Blue Man Group we took a chance on Dragon Noodle (see my reviews on each of those) and it was AWESOME.

Hotel: Layout is so smart.  From check in, elevators are close saving a trek through the casino.  Pool is super easy to get to, near the elevators.  Food court is near by too.  Most manageable layout for a strip hotel and make it a great choice for families.

Pool:  LOVE.  Crowd ranges and ...well you see it all.  Come as you are, you'll fit in.  Show your key, they check for glass in bags.  Small shop has essentials and if you want a cold beer w\/o having to wait (or tip) you can get it here like grabbing a soda.  TIP: you can rent inner-tubes to use in the main pool or lazy river OR bring your own, buy in the gift shop or ABC store.  They will inflate anything you have.  For our 3 day stay we bought 2 med ones for $12 each in the gift shop.  Deal.   Food prices are on par for Vegas. Service this busy weekend has been great.

Lazy river, wave pool and main pool, volleyball court w sand.....many places for beverages and BONUS, free water cooler (watermelon infused) so you can stay hydrated. Only one bathroom area though.  DJ at the top of the wave pool area starts at noon, so fun.  No drinks in wave pool or lazy river.  All seating gone by 9am, no joke. Clears out some by noon. 

Cabanas: 3 styles and unlike some hotels where the high rollers get first crack and pricing is obscure...this is easy but reserve in ADVANCE!  We knew this was prime time to hit the pool and I wanted one day where we didn't have to stress over seating.  

Only 8 full cabanas, near lazy river\/wave pool.  TIP: Do not get #8 unless you get a deal, it is by the bathrooms and on a walkway, worst location ever.
They have about 11 lazy river day beds, 2 with pergola like things so you can use curtains to shield. Include a fun queen sz bed with 2 lounge chairs, towels, 2 tubes.  Or, the basic which we got, and it is so fun...umbrella with the bed and 2 lounge chairs.  Service is awesome and attentive.  

TIP: For the cost of the rental, you can apply ALL food and bev charges towards that.  Family of 4?  I should be able to do that by noon lol.  Husband was gonna hit Starbucks and I tripped him walking away,  no way, we are eating at the cabana ONLY today!! That is a deal.  I did not get that offer at Bellagio or Caesars cabanas.  FYI we paid top pricing for saturday on the holiday weekend, so $400, plus they add 18% gratuity and tip.  Well spent IMO.  If no one has rented by noon I heard you can ""make an offer"" too.

Hotel Location: Great. My little one isn't a fan of walking and the 13yr old can shop 24\/7.   This is perfect.

Recap: I researched for days and days to make this trip work for kids.  Top 3 hotels for families are consistently MGM, Mandalay and Monte Carlo.  This one for price, amenities and location win IMO.",9,1,1

I just left your Monte Carlo location with by far the most horrendous experience I have ever had in my entire life at a hotel . From the check in process I requested a high level strip view and was told I was not going to receive that request and ended up with the lowest level construction and no difference in price , at first I was extremely upset that not only was I being given attitude with the impression as if I wasn't worth a nice view I had  to ask for a compensation I was given the choice of one resort fee removed or a 50.00 credit . I inquired about the credit and was told  "" oh no not just for one restaurant you can use it for anything in the casino don't worry ! It is just taken off the room at check out !"" Well okay that seems like a great deal we will take that . We get to the room and not only was it not clean enough to my standard the grout in the bathroom had black mold on it and the wall behind the bathroom door had yellow stains everywhere . Okay so besides the room , we paid for buffet as well we walked into the buffet and no one greeted us we stood for 20 minutes and no one came to guide us in so we didn't get to eat , my child was crying and I had to settle for a fast food establishment . Now at my check out experience was the absolute worse booking.com gave me a grand total that was 100 dollars over what I was told on booking and the booking had included resort fee , the lady helping me was raising her voice and all I was just asking to break down every so I can understand at this point from all previous experience I was exhausted and just so dissatisfied thus far I was exhausted.. at the end I was told the credit was only for food and beverage and I was a liar , called a liar to my face and that was when I had enough . My name is Blank  and this casino treated me worse than any other experience in my life and ruined every other Vegas experience , I drove 5 hours home in disbelief .

Overall, it alright, nothing spectacular. Checking in, we tried to suavely hand over the $20 trick, which the check-in lady promptly gave back. Yeah, not so suave. But then she ""upgraded"" us to a strip view room to a strip view room on the 118th floor so yay! 
Be aware that there is a mandatory hotel services fee of ~22 dollars per day (includes not so great Wifi, water bottles, gym). 

The room was alright...kinda dingy really (even the considerably cheaper Flamingo's pink decor seemed nicer). Unfortunately, the walls are as thin as paper. There was a group of 15+ girls next to us banging the walls and screaming every 10 seconds. We even heard vomiting sounds an hour later...ughh disgusting. Thankfully they checked out soon after.  

The location is the best part. It's right next to MGM (Hakkasan anyone?) and in close proximity to other hotels like the Cosmo and the Wynn. I highly suggest driving and using valet (cheap at $2-4 tip) or using a taxi because it is sweat within seconds weather over there.    

There's 3 pools. Be sure to get there early or be forced to walk in the hellish heat looking for a seat. Or, get on a guestlist\/talk to a promoter and go the awesome pool parties (I recommend Encore Beach or Marquee Dayclub!).",1,0,0

For what we were looking for this hotel met our needs. Well priced and good location. The hotel itself if a 3 out of 5. 
I had reserved a room with a king bed and they were out when I checked in and I wound up with 2 doubles (not even queen beds). I notice little things when I travel like wallpaper peeling in the bathroom and showers in need or re-grouting. It's annoying to look at. 
For the little amount of time I spent in the room it was fine. I cannot say that about the pool area which was sad looking. Yes people enjoyed themselves, but it was hard to find any chair in the sun and they want $12 for a tube rental in their super small lazy river. The good deal to be had is a large reusable plastic drinking cup is $16 for your first drink and only $12 to refill.

We called and even asked for the manager on duty and still NO ONE!  Also since they are renovating the hotel the construction noise is terrible!  They turn off the water intermittently without informing the guests or housekeeping. One day housekeeping came and turned on the faucet in our room and discovered no water. She cleaned the rest of the room and then came back a few hours later to a flooded room. We got a call saying our room was extracted bc we left the faucet on. No apologies at first!  The maid turned it on and left it on!  The tub is always dirty and the bathroom towel racks keep falling. It's a waste of time to tell anyone. Customer service has gone down hill here. Maybe it's bc of the renovation but right now it's not worth the money to stay here. They tried to give us a food and beverage credit but most of the restaurants are closed here!  Don't bother staying here right now. At least until renovations are over and maybe they will refrain the employees on customer service. An employee at MLife actually complained to me that they keep pressing customer service but half their equipment is broken and they go back and forth on their promises to the customers.

Vomit stain on the carpet coming off the elevator, for 2 days. Girl vomiting all over the elevator lobby at 4am ... what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas for her because she won't remember a thing. Oh, nice acoustics in the rooms, between the cleaning staff laughing it up and talking on radios in the hall, to the very quick but happy ending sex of the couple next door and the alarm clock going blasting spanish radio with volume set to 11 in the other adjacent room -- with nobody home, it is just an audible delight. 

On the upside, the Vomit Carlo is pretty easy to get in and out of and centrally located so it can be an okay home base. I'd take ear plugs for the room and watch you step but the sheets are clean and there is excellent water pressure in the shower!!

Some folks in our group heard that it had been recently redone but we didn't see any evidence of that in the guest room area.

My sister went on Friday the 5th and when they were asked if they were there for a Venue and she showed them her tickets, they did not charge them. We went on Sat. the 6th and when he asked for our parking pass I explained we were there for the Cher show.

I understand the employee only does what he is told but shame on Monte Carlo for finding yet another way to rip off the locals.

My mom had a high school reunion at the Monte Carlo, so she decided it would be a great idea to make it a mini family vacation. I called Monte Carlo a couple of months in advance and got a special rate with complimentary strip view for two rooms. Every staff member I talked to prior our visit was extremely helpful, kind, and respectful which was a great start. 

LOBBY\/ARRIVAL: Monte Carlo is on the strip and will cost you about $13-$17 including a $2 surcharge fee for any airport or McCarran property pick up. The lobby was extremely clean, everything was easy to find (casinos, food court, pool, ballrooms etc) and the rooms were separated by elevators (ie rooms 5-12, 27-35 etc) Since we had a 5am flight and arrived at 7am, we asked if there were any rooms available for us to check into for the meantime. The employee informed us that it would be a $20 per room charge to check in anytime after 9am and before 3pm and also informed us that we could leave our baggage for no additional fee. It was around 7am and we decided we would keep our bags and eat breakfast at the McDonald's in the food court. At 9am, the line grew to about 10 parties and there were only 3 employees designated for check in, which increased the waiting time to 30 minutes before I got to check in.

ROOMS: Tracy, the employee who helped me, was extremely kind, personable, and very helpful during my stay. She informed me that they were at 97% capacity and the only rooms she could give us were on the same floor, but about 15 rooms away from each other for $22 and some change (including tax) Since it was 9am and most of our party had pull all nighters, I agreed to pay the fee and we went straight to our rooms. Immediately upon entering, I noticed that room 5-320 was very dark and had a view of construction, which we didn't mind at all. The room was seriously something out of the haunted mansion with the light fixtures bearing dim bulbs! The cleanliness of the room appeared to be okay, until we removed our shoes and stepped on the carpet which felt filthy! As for the sheets, I am not super picky about sheets, but everyone in our room agreed that the sheets felt rough and many complained about bites in the morning. The worst part was the bathroom; the bathroom didn't include a hair dryer and we had to request for one, the bathtub was flooded, and the towels smelled like syrup. 

The remaining of us stayed in room 5-335, which was all the way at the end of the hall. My mom immediately called me and asked if she could switch rooms because it reeked of smoke and it was aggravating her asthma. I went to check it out and indeed, it smelled of cigarette smoke so I called front desk and they informed us that housekeeping would bring in some sort of odorizer, but we would need to be out of the room for an hour, which was fine with us. After taking a nap, I checked on the room and it smelled much better than when we first arrived, so kudos to the housekeeping staff for being efficient! My youngest sister told me that their towels were dirty, which is extremely disgusting. Again, the staff was really great about replacing dirty towels, but that is something that could've been avoided in the first place!

The next day, I received a text message saying our adjacent strip view rooms were ready at around 2pm. 27-213 and 27-215 were such an improvement from the rooms on the 5th floor! The rooms were both clean, bright, and had great views of the pool and partial strip views. We all agreed that the upper floor rooms were more updated than the ones on the lower floor, so do request for an upper floor room if you can! 

AMENITIES: Monte Carlo has a great casino near the lobby and I was pleasantly surprised with my winnings from the trip. On our last day, some of the machines weren't working due to a power outage, but at least my favorite machine was still working! They have a small food court with Starbucks, Sbarro, McDonald's, Rubio's etc and some were open 24 hours! The pool was great and had a variety of swimming pools such as a lazy river, a wave pool, and a regular pool. I noticed that they had small cabanas, a sandy seating area, and a VIP pool with a cabana! Along with the hotel fee, you have to pay a mandatory resort fee of $20 something dollars and you get a $50 credit to spend on one of their Las Vegas Blvd restaurants, which was nice. Don't forget that you have to spend the $50 credit before checking out or else it becomes invalid! Also, wifi immediately disconnects when checking out. The best part about this hotel is that there is a free tram that takes you to the Crystals, Bellagio, and of course, the Monte Carlo - the wait time was less than 6 minutes!

Overall, I wouldn't stay at this hotel again and would much rather stay in an updated hotel.",4,1,0

ROOM: The beds were pretty comfortable, but when we asked for more towels for our room, it took the staff 30 mins to bring them up. 

POOL: sounded so cool in the descriptions, yet when we arrived, looking for a relaxing time and a pina colada by the pool, all we found were dirty frat boys drunk off their asses at 4pm. The first thing we saw was a girl being half carried out of the area by two security guards because she was so wasted. And the bumping house music was really annoying. My friends and I are no old ladies either, we're three early 20 somethings, but I'm sorry, but when I want to go to a club, I'll go to a club, not a hotel pool. Even the hot tub smelled like beer, and no one in it at that moment was drinking. GROSS. 

BRUNCH: 21.99 all you can eat? I'm in! After a crazy ""only in vegas"" night, my friend and I ran down to the brunch, only to be greeted by a long, snaking, disneyland-ish line to pay. The brunch really had EVERYTHING (normal breakfast fare, crab legs, sushi, chinese food..) but all of it was vaguely average and slightly questionable. The only good things we ate were the scrambled eggs and the biscuits. everything else was blehh. especially the french toast and the omelets from the omelet station! Very disappointing as we were hungover and really looking forward to a good sobering brunch. 

I wouldnt recommend someone stay at Monte Carlo, but if necessary I would stay there again. I would probably choose another hotel to stay in next time though. 

one thing i didnt like was that you had to pay a ""resort fee"" of $13.00 so you could use the gym\/internet. But we DIDNT use either soooooo, waste of money.

Everything went well on the 4th until the morning of 5th when construction noises was bothering us and water was not running. We were desperate for a nap after a long stroll outdoor. We decided to make a room change request on the 5th at 4:50PM, and Andrianna at the counter was super friendly to assist us in that request. However, she told us that all spa suite are booked. She inform us that she would go talk to the manager, and she said she can upgrade us to a diamond suite that was originally $180\/night but we will have to pay $30 as upgrade fee. I asked Andrianna what would our other option be? She said that is the only option. She is trying her best to help, we wouldn't give her a hard time. I don't feel like we should have to pay the extra because it is not our fault and we were not notified of the constructioning that's above our floor.

It started with a ridiculously long wait to check in --over 40 mins on a Wednesday? Really? I could see this kind of a wait on the weekend or a Friday night but this took me by surprise as I've never waited this long mid-week. The irritating part was there were clerks at their stations who just weren't calling people. I supposed they could've been working on some other issue but then don't stand there and make it look like you have all these clerks working when only two are actually checking people in. :( 

My other major disappointment with the MC was that they closed the pool at 4PM for a PRIVATE event. Really? During the summer when it's 100+ degrees and your guests want to stay by the pool most of the day, you close the pool that is supposed to be for ALL guest for a private event? Keep in mind, they charge us a resort fee for all the amenities including the pool and yet, we can't use it because they're making money off it for a private event. I think at the minimum they should've refunded our resort fee on the day they closed the pool but no such offer was made at check-out.

The room itself has a lot of broken and torn things (ie lamps, shower curtains, furniture etc). That being said, my biggest issue with the room was that cell reception was horrible and there was no in room wifi. There is only wifi on the casino floor. Walls are also VERY thin. We were stuck between a room with an infant crying and a couple who rotated between having sex and arguing all night.  Either way, was a long night. The hotel itself is fine. The casino and sports book are both a decent size. The line to place bets in the sports books was handled efficiently and effectively. 

Pool: the pool is small. You have to walk over random people in order to get to your chair. Chairs are jammed pack right next to each other and the entire area gets extremely crowded during the weekend. I highly recommend that you rent a day bed or a cabana. It made a huge difference for us. The food at the pool was great. Quesadillas were fantastic and the drinks were delicious.

Restaurants: there's a good variety of food here. Yusho was a classic Japanese style restaurant. The flavors could be very difficult for people who are not used to fermented ingredients. The coffee shop has amazing breakfast sandwiches as well. 

The reason I am giving this place a three is a combination of the wifi issue and the crowd. It wasn't what I was looking for. There are a ton of kids ranging from infants to teenagers. If you are booking a place for your family, this may be ideal but when wanting to focus on sports and relaxing by the pool, the magnitude of kids screaming and running around can be a bit much.

Or rather, nice location, nice rooms and easy on the wallet. (as far as being on the strip goes). I found a deal on US Airways.com for 6 nights plus airfare for around $800 per person flying from DC. This was a really great bargain. It sits on the south end of the strip closer to the airport.

We came during Christmas week and they hotel interior was decked out with trees and bulbs. The check in line seemed to move pretty fast. It took less than 15 minutes to reach the front desk. We were given a room with a view of the strip, so I felt pretty excited about that.

However, we got to our room and we hit a snag. The room was not cleaned. I was a little outraged. I called the front desk and they quickly reprogrammed our cards to another room. We didn't have to go all the way back down. The new room was okay, it had two queen sized beds. Then next day they gave us the option to move to a room with a king sized bed (which we accepted). 

The rooms were nice but basic. No microwave oven or refrigerator. Basic toiletries. 40 inch flat screen tv, dresser, small table with two chairs and a desk. No wifi, but they have an LAN cable to connect to your laptop for internet. I unfortunately did not bring a laptop.

They have a food court at the casino level with subway, sbarro, mcdonalds, a chinese carryout, mexican restaurant and a cheese steak joint. Here is where you can get the hotel wifi. The food court is also right next to the tunnel of shops that lead to the Aria hotel. They also have a few sit down restaurants that are more costly.

They have an outdoor pool, but it was apparently closed at the time, but I was able to go to the Aria hotel next door and use their pool by just flashing my room key. Their pool is outdoors but heated and they have 3 giant hot tubs to ease into as well. 

The casino was pretty typical. Lots of different slots, table games like poker, blackjack, craps and roulette. The Blue Man group performs here. We received a couple of tickets along with our package from US Airways. It was nice to just go from our room straight to the theater to see them.

Sure - you still want people to walk to through the Casino, and I probably still would have, but i wouldn't have been disappointed when I arrived knowing what to expect.  

I've never stayed in their rooms, but check out the pictures of the new rooms.  They appear to have gone the route of the Linq hotel.  Bare bones minimum.  Hopefully the rates will reflect the offerings.",1,0,0

I've stayed at a handful of other hotels, and for the price you pay, it's not bad. I stay here when it's cheap. I won't pay more than $50 for a hotel there. Rooms come with a keurig, chick is great because it's the only Vegas hotel I've been to that has a coffee maker, that saves me easily $5 a day. 
The rooms are clean, and simple. The beds are comfy. I like the seating area with a table and couch. Self parking is among the easiest compared to other hotels. 

I did too much day drinking last time and stayed in for the night while the man went out to play. I was too lazy\/sick to go get food for myself so opted for room service. $15 for a sandwich is ridiculous but it was so convenient I didn't even care. And it was tasty and cured me. 

The pool is fun. Crowded. But I like floating around in the lazy river and hope people don't pee in it. They also have a jacuzzi. I don't think I've ever seen another hotel that has a jacuzzi. Something about liability with the mixture of booze and heat. But I'm glad they have one. 

They have tons of restaurants and a food court which is very easy. The pub was a good place to hit up for happy hour. Nice priced well drinks and food. Neat decor. No complaints really.",6,3,4

Room was pretty big nice comfy bed. Had a little desk. Bathroom was a good size. It was soooooo easy to get around that hotel everythin was a turn away. I loved it. I never got lost.

Stayed here one night and it will be the last night I ever stay at this piece of shit hotel. This place is super outdated....they better pour some money into renovating this shit hole.  I was expecting MGM level accommodations but was deeply disappointed that it was more like Circus Circus. 

The arrival:

1:30PM: called them when we hit Primm to see if there would be a problem checking in early (normal check in is 3PM).  The retard on the phone said she doesn't know and that I would have to check with the front desk when I get there.  
2:15PM: Stood in line to check in.  
2:35PM: Yea, that's right!! 20 minutes to get to the front desk. 
2:42PM: They finished checking me in. Hey, at least I was able to get my room almost a whopping 20mins early.  

The shower: 

I woke up to no hot water and when I physically went down stairs to check out and complain; they gave me coupons!!  


The conclusion:

F-ing coupons!!  Take your coupons that came with a free subway 6inch and shove it up your ass Monte Carlo!!!    

If only I could give negative stars!!

It has been here since the 1990's and hasn't really updated their look since. As of right now, Blue Man Group is currently playing at this hotel (they have been featured at other hotels in the past few years). 

Anyways, what gives this hotel an extra star (putting it at a 4 star rating) is the at they provide complementary wifi to everyone who comes to their hotel (guests and visitors). Honestly, that is a rarity of a hotel on the Vegas strip to offer free wifi (Why? I have no idea... All the hotels should provide it for free instead of asking for a daily fee). Their wifi is quick and fast and very easy to log into. It really does make me want to come visit this hotel while I am visiting Las Vegas. Now granted you can also find wifi at Starbucks, Earl of Sandwich, Famous Footwear, BCBG & Sephora at the Miracle Mile Shops, but I don't feel obligated to spend my money to use their free wifi and can actually just sit back on one of the benches in the lobby area and relax and take as much time as I want to use it. 

Plenty of parking in their self parking lot. Clean restrooms. Happy to come back and visit. The only major con I see for this hotel is that they do not allow dogs, other than service dogs.",1,0,0

""where are you staying?""
""Monte Carlo.""
""where the eff is THAT?""

""so what do you think about this hotel? be honest.""
""GHETTO.""

I've stayed at Monte Carlo twice with a few girlfriends for our past Vegas trips. All I have to say is that as a hotel, it gets the job done. There are clean beds, a clean bathroom, place to put your shit, mirrors, lights, an iPod dock... but that's it. Otherwise, it is old and doesn't feel shiny and pretty like Vegas should. 

I had stayed at the Aria one night and after checking into Monte Carlo it hit me hard that this was a MAJOR downgrade. My exact thoughts were ""....damn, should've showered when we were in Aria."" My thoughts after getting in the shower were ""... damn, should've grabbed the shampoo and conditioner from Aria."" The shampoo and conditioner SUCKS sooo much here, don't even bother- it doesn't do ANYTHING for your hair. AND the bathroom ventilation is crappy. I could go on and on...

The location is semi-okay but technically this hotel isn't even ON the strip. You drive down this long street\/ side road to get to it. Two good things I can say for Monte Carlo is - 1) huge free self parking lot and 2) it's pretty close to Aria and City Center in which you can take a short walk or the free tram.

Seriously, you know the hotel isn't nice when you notice there's not a single security at the elevators... even at 4am...

For people on a budget and with low standards then Monte Carlo works. For me, it is definitely not my preferred choice.",3,4,2

We stayed in a spa suite and found the room to be large, clean, comfy and wonderful! No, it wasn't decorated the way I'd choose for my home, but it was nice! The very large jacuzzi tub was great! The wetbar area included a mini fridge and keurig coffee maker.  I didn't notice any funky deodorizer smell that many of these reviewers complain of. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful.  The main pool is in the shadow of the hotel all day, as previously mentioned, but the lazy river and wave pool are in the sun most of the day. We loved the lazy river! Drinks are expensive by the pool, but this is normal for vegas. We kept beer in the fridge in our room, much more cost effective. Although the hotel is not the most updated and modern you can get it is perfectly nice, in a great, central location, and a great value for the money. We were very pleased with the service. Didn't have any difficulties with check in or out. We didn't have any issues with our stay at all. Enjoyed everything, and the Monte Carlo definitely exceeded our expectations.

after my 4 hour drive to vegas (i know.. i should've flown) i FINALLY arrived at monte carlo at 2:30 am. I was promptly checked in and I headed over to my room.

As I was walking.. i noticed a lot of things that should've put up red flags, but I was too damn tired to even take notice of these things.  The hallway became so humid, and there were things everywhere in the hallway, like newspapers from the morning and food from room service...

Anyway, I go inside my room and I noticed an empty can of beer on the bedside..thing? table? whatever the hell its called.

then I go into the restroom to find a bag of trash on the countertop and the toilet had shit in it. 

wow monte carlo. where's your cleaning crew at?!

I went down to the front desk, told them everything, and they gave me a new room immediately and lots of coupons... that I didn't use.  

the new room was pretty much the same room, except cleaned. 

also. I stayed at the Monte Carlo hotel only because I wanted to see the Jabbawackeez show.  I had purchased meet and greet tickets, and the show was phenomenal. It was the best show i have ever seen.

My only problem was Monte Carlo.  We weren't allowed to snap photos during our meet and greet... we had to purchase their professional photo... which is fine, so long as I get my damn photo with my idols\/husbands hahaha.  Meet and greet ended and we were waiting for our photos to get developed so that we could buy them... and then the photographers came back empty handed and said that they had no photos for us and that they were sorry. wtf. 

that such bull. 

anyway, i called to complain the next day and the next time i watch the show, i'll be able to meet them again without having to pay extra for the meet and greet... but seriously, that sucks so much for all those fans that flew from michigan, washington, san francisco to see them. at least i'm a driving distance away.",2,1,1

I booked this hotel through a vacations package and was so excited at how inexpensive is was. I had stayed here in the past but it has REALLY gone downhill. We got to our room and it barely had a closet and it faced the dumpster so the whole night we could hear the trash being dumped. I asked to switch rooms and they said they would be able to the next day (we checked in on a Saturday). In the middle of the night the couple next to us got into a raging fight. The walls were so thin that it sounded like they were next to us. We called security but I could not wait to get out of the room.
The next day we packed up our bags like we were told and left for the day. I was supposed to get a text between 2pm and 5pm about our new room and they would move our bags and our keys would work in the new room. So I though that would redeem the stay. Never got a text, checked with customer service and they never had anything in our room about switching. Even though I was upset they didn't seem to care about moving us, we had to do it ourselves and the second room wasn't much better. Dingy and old and GROSS stains on the furniture. 
I agree with the other reviews, $30 for a resort fee per night when you had to go to the MGM to use a pool AND had to pay an extra fee to use the gym. What exactly does that pay for? We got room service and the guy who dropped it off was really nice and told us they are upgrading the hotel in the next couple years. I get that they don't want to put money into something they are changing but would new chairs and possibly an alarm clock kill them? I will never stay here again even after the upgrade.",0,0,1

We got to the room only to realize that someone else had obviously been in there and it was never  cleaned up. The soap was open and the wrapper was on the floor, there was trash in the can, and the person even left his plane ticket from that morning. He must have not liked the room and then switched, but house keeping didn't clean the room in between. 

Then the safe was broken, and so we needed to switch rooms anyway because I had a very expensive camera with me.  Of course they didn't have any rooms left with 2 beds so they told us our only option was to stay in a smoking room that night. Gross! It smelled so bad! And on top of that, my camera didn't end up even fitting in the safe! 

When the bellman brought our bags up to the room, he was very nice at first...I tipped him at the end, and to my surprise - he counted the money right in front of me, snarled and stormed out of the room without a word!!!!! I could NOT believe it!

You mean to tell me you run a giant hotel on the Las Vegas strip and yet somehow all you have left is ONE blanket in the entire hotel?? REALLY?!

I could go on, but honestly I am so disgruntled that I don't even want to relive it.

The only one available was a smoking room when I specifically requested non smoking upon booking. You can smell the smoke when you get off the elevator. The entire floor reeks of smoke. Floor 26. The smoke scent in the room is intolerable. The room is small compared to other hotels. Just compare the building to that of The Aria right across the street. Monte Carlo is dwarfed by it. This was probably a nice hotel in the 80's but they clearly have not kept up with the times. I've never stayed at ANY hotel that did not provide at least two soaps (one for face, one for shower) but they only provide one here. Bathroom is small and the quality of towels is definitely inferior. The long from them rubs off on your body. Pathetic. I saved the worst for last. No deadbolt! For those who do not think it's important like I once did until my girlfriend enlightened me. (She works at a hotel) Suppose someone checks in at midnight while you're in your room sleeping. If the agent at the front desk accidentally codes the key to your room, that person will enter while you're sleeping because there is no deadbolt. How scary that could be. It could be a robber, who knows. As I said not a good hotel other than location. I would not recommend to anyone. F-",1,0,0

The only reason we picked the Monte Carlo was because the place seemed to be okay and the price was much better than many of the other places. I guess I should have known as there was some activity going on the weekend we were there (i.e. Spring Break ...) and all the other hotels were equally expensively prepared except for the Monte Carlo.

The Monte Carlo was just one disappointment after another. First, they were doing construction on their parking garage so you could either park in a very tiny lot that filled up quickly near the hotel or risk a cold 10 minute walk in the March Vegas weather to the entrance. Not very well thought out for its patrons indeed. Their check in was okay but their baggage service was forced upon us even though we declined. Who does that? And the rooms were okay, the bathrooms need better ventilation and they seriously need to remodel. This place isn't even on the strip as you have to drive through a very long road \/ side drive way to get to the actual strip. Now that City Center is up it essentially blocks out Monte Carlo's view of the strip altogether and completely overshadows the place.

It doesn't even have any good restaurants or casino area as the buffet was $20 \/ person on a weekend and there was like ... nothing appetizing. With all the other fantastic options on the strip I definitely would not stay here again in the future.",3,1,0

Pros:
Decent food court (Starbucks, McDonald's, Sbarro, Subway)
Casino with nice games and that doesn't completely reek of cigarette smoke
Restaurants
Clean spacious rooms

Cons:
No fan in bathroom
Bar soap provided smelled awful
No real shopping to speak of
Very small outdoor pool and hot tub
Crappy $10 daily ""resort"" fee that includes nothing I utilized

Overall I would stay here again for the price and location. Plus they were accommodating when we checked in (four hours early, no less) and asked for two rooms close by each other and the elevators so my in-laws didn't have far to walk.

Tip: Go across the street to that food court if you want ice cream. It's Dreyer's (aka Edy's) so it's better, plus it's cheaper than the place in this hotel. Try the gelato, it's very yummy!

When we checked in around 7pm, it was pretty quick.  The checkout counter was very near to the taxi drop off.  I almost forgot about the free buffet credit that came with the hotel booking, but the receptionist was kind to remind me and let me know how to redeem it.  

The rooms were better than what I expected after reading reviews online. It's not the most luxurious, but worth what I paid for.  The only minor gripes off the bat were that I had to plug the bed light and turn on the main power switch for the TV. This would've been more of an inconvenience for a non-techie.  The resort fee included coffee (1 cup coffee maker using packaged grounds), wired internet (wireless was spotty on the 17th floor, but they only guaranteed connection on floors 1 and 2) and 2 mini bottles of water.  The beds were comfortable and soft. Our room was facing the pool side.  I didn't think the noise level was distracting, but others not used to it might not enjoy it.  It was only on during early afternoon to sunset. Other reviews said the walls were thin, but I couldn't hear any of my neighbors.  Bathroom was a good size.  Fixtures could use an update soon though.  I thought the shower faucet was leaky at first, but I just had to turn it tight.

One of the reasons I chose the hotel was its central location.  New York New York was less than 5 minutes walking distance away.  There is a free monorail past the shops that stopped by Crystals Center and Bellagio.  The temperature at that time was between 100-110 degrees, so this helped a lot and saved us money that we normally would use on the bus or taxi. There is a good selection of places to eat here.  New places opened up in the front area facing the strip.

The casino itself was one of the smaller ones on the strip I've been to other than Bally's. The only slots I really play are Wheel of Fortune which are conveniently placed by the room elevators and buffet. The Pai Gow dealer Fernando was very friendly to chat with.  Drink service was excellent all around, especially at the tables and Wheel of Fortune areas.",4,0,2

To start off this is a cheaper, cleaner, and friendlier Resort than Luxor or Excalibur, Don't even consider Luxor, read my review to see why.

The walk from the Parking garage to Registration was actually very short. There was no line to check in and the man was very friendly. The Elevators are literally next to the Registration desk, the corridors were very short and clean. 

ROOM: The room was very basic but clean and nicely appointed. The beds were comfortable and the air felt great! My view was of the T-Mobile Arena, New York-NewYork and the dreaded Excalibur and Luxor. The bathroom was nice, a little dirty. The shower head was disgusting! It was one of the most disgusting shower heads I've ever seen. Other than that the room was great! 

The casino was very nice, felt as I was inside a 5 star Resort, that's what's great about this property, you feel classy with this being a 3 star resort.

First, this was my first trip to Vegas and thus my expectations were high. Second, because I majored in Hospitality during college, I know what should and shouldn't be in a situation.

The short version: we had a good front desk person to start, but after bugs, weed, thin walls, terrible customer service, and a myriad of charges and fees that were inexplicable considering the circumstances of our stay, our stay was exhausting, overpriced, and very frustrating to a first time visitor to Las Vegas.

We arrived on Saturday night\/Sunday morning around 12:30 or so. The front desk person, Chrystyna, did an excellent job. We reserved a King bedroom, which they were out of for the first night. When we got to the room, which had two double beds, we discovered that moths were already occupying that space. After a short conversation, Chrystyna helped to facilitate a room change the following day and said she would waive two of the resort fees for our stay (more on that shortly). This would be the end of our ""luck"" at the Monte Carlo.

We changed rooms the following day after an excursion to Death Valley. Shortly after we changed rooms, the entire floor of our room was filled with marijuana odor. I get it, you're in Vegas, it's basically legal in all of the states around here, but at least do it on a smoking floor. The person at the front desk said that several people had complained, but no apology was offered, just a simple ""security is working on it"". 

The ambiance was severely lacking in both rooms we stayed in. The walls seemed to be paper thin, and we could here entire conversations even at a whispers sound level. Our second room also had an adjoining door in between rooms, which contributed to a lack of sleep on our side. I'm glad the couple next door had fun, but it was not fun for us.

The final full day of our stay was relatively quiet. We spent some time at the pool, which was nothing special but adequate. If you want anything to drink, it's a hassle and a half to get a waitresses attention, even on the casino floor. 

Regarding the casino, I am a novice when it comes to slots. I didn't play a lot of them, but they seemed to dominate the floor. The smell of the casino is a mix of air fresheners and cigarette smoke, which was not unexpected. The card games have $10 minimums, also not unexpected, but it can get pricey if you're not prepared. Bring at least $500 if you plan to gamble any on the strip (sans the slots). 

This leads us to what I feel is the final nail in the proverbial coffin of this resort, checking out. The process was convenient, but we got a couple of unexpected surprises. First, we discovered that we were not comped two nights of our resort fees. Though resort fees seem to be the norm in Vegas, we booked our stay through hotels.com, and in each case of booking through that website, all of the potential fees, charges and taxes are included in the final tally. It's frustrating to find out that not only were you not given what you were promised, but that the charges were added after the fact. 

After talking with a supervisor for all of 30 seconds, she waived three of the resort fees. We appreciated that, but after checking the credit card balance, we noticed that there was a hold for roughly $140 on the card card from the resort. 

We literally spent no money on the card in question while at the resort. No room service, no meals charged to the room, no blue man group tickets, not one thing. We gambled in cash, didn't eat or drink at the resort, and didn't go to any shows. 

The explanation given for the hold was for ""incidentals"". Never have I had a hold of that much put on a card at any hotel or resort (including Disney properties). I understand a business wanting to ensure they get paid for their service, but this was a bridge too far. After speaking with a customer service rep, she said it would take 5-7 business days for it to be returned.Why not charge as you go? Why not decline a charge if there isn't enough money on it? Those are questions that I did not ask because I was too livid, but still deserve an answer to. 

Bottom line, which ironically is all that this hotel cares about, you should most definitely consider staying at a different resort. It seems to be worth the extra money to stay at Caesar's or the Venetian. If you're going to get a bunch of fees and charges, you shouldn't have to put up with stuff like this. A couple of apologies and fixes along the way (which did happen with Chrystyna) and a majority of my issues are null and void. Instead, I was brushed off with little to no regard. 

I'd be happy to discuss my issues with someone from management. You may feel free to contact me here.",5,0,1

Okay, first thing. The rooms were pretty clean. But it was the casino area that really sucked and caused us to get aggravated. We sat down to play some Blackjack. After a few hands, I pulled out an Ashton Churchill cigar (a big one!) and started to light it up. But I was stopped by the dealer. ""I'm sorry sir, there's no cigar smoking here."" Me - ""What? Seriously?"" Dealer - ""Yes."" So I stopped playing, stood up, and lit my cigar. I think I smoked half of that thing right by the table before the dealer was changed out. For some reason, it was okay to smoke there right next to the table, but not while sitting at it. WTF? Every casino lets you smoke but this one?! Casinos let people smoke in them. This means cigarettes and cigars. 

So, then we moved on to another table. I was still smoking my cigar, but a friend of mine sat down and started to play. He let out a big ""F^@#"" when he lost a big hand and the dealer told him to watch his language. (There were two other guys at the table about our same age.) We were starting to get pissed off now, so he just kept saying it - with the dealer correcting him every time. So now I started asking questions while he was playing; also including that great word at least 5-6 times in every sentence. This place was pissing us off.

Then we decided we had enough and went out to get some drinks. We went to a liquor store and picked up quite a few items to supply us for the weekend. I picked up a 750ml bottle of Jack Daniels and my buddy get a similar size bottle of Jaeger. This was going to be our gambling drinks. We also got some more cigars. We then went back to the hotel's casino and walked through the place with the giant bottles of alcohol while smoking our cigars. Every employee we passed asked us if we were done with our drinks and wanted to take them. I'm surprised we didn't get kicked out, but after all they just wanted our money. Who cares if we were a PITA.

Negatives- it's like Excalibur, it's the one MGM forgot. Very plain, basic, still not quite sure of the theme, rooms are like staying at a regular hotel. Doesn't feel like a resort.

When there are no pools spas hot tubs saunas or fitness center and only two restaurants that close at 10 and one of those restaurants has the only lounge\/bar in the hotel also closed at 10 then I think MGM should waive that fee. Limited slots was also disappointing. Oh. And room service only 6am to 2pm. Our faucet in the bathroom had no hot water. Thankfully the shower did.

So, the room was in decent shape, I mean, it's just a budget hotel in a decent location, but there were no cups in the bathroom, and only 1 pillow per person. Standard I guess in such a hotel. 

We only had the room cleaned one day out of the four we were there, and they did a lame job of it. Not all towels on the floor were picked up, and there was an empty takeout container left in the room. I understand it's hard sometimes to figure out what's garbage and what's not, but after the TV incident, it was hard for me to give them the benefit of the doubt. 

The pool was fun, until I wanted to relax and read a book. It screams MTV Spring Break. So, not a place to go for a quiet read, but still full of good booze, music and people. I asked our waitress for a glass of water, along with a mojito and a burger. My friends ordered food too.

Looks like a regular hotel room (If people are paying 20-30% more for these rooms, TRUST ME, it's a mistake.)

1. Bathroom was a cesspool (hair all over shower walls, moldy-looking residue in corners, tub didn't drain so it was up to my ankles by end of shower, floor visibly dirty). 
2. With all the visible signs of uncleanliness in the bathroom, you really have to wonder about all the things you can't see....
3. Entire floor smelled strongly of marijuana.
4. Room was incredibly dated, dank, and not inviting in any sense. If you want a visual: imagine a truck stop motel, then don't change anything. 
5. Customer service sucks. After airing these grievances to Priceline, the hotel staff agreed to refund the $33 resort fee (out of the total $152 for the night). What a joke...

Anyone who claims this hotel is any nicer than 2 stars is probably the same person who hotboxed our entire floor.

I will NEVER make the mistake of returning to this hotel, and recommend you don't either. You have endless better options on the Vegas Strip.",15,3,2

The inside of the hotel and casino are very nice, pretty standard flashy looking for the hotels on the upper end of the hotels on the Strip.

Check in was fine. We had back to back reservations because we used MyVegas rewards, but the concierge assured that we would be set for our whole stay. (More on that later...)

We encountered a bit of a mess on the way up to our room: Elevators looked like they had been graffitied (this is why we can't have nice things, people!), wall looked like it had been kicked in, and dirt looked to be embedded into carpet. The room itself was about the same- sheets were ripped and dirty, bathroom had mold, etc. I'm really not one to get too bothered by this (I worked at a hotel at one point in time) so we figured we'd just deal with it.

The next day, upon returning to the room, we discovered that our keys no longer worked. This was due to the back to back reservation, which we had already been told wouldn't be a problem. Frustrated, we asked to be moved to a different room. The concierge complied with our request and just said to come down the next morning to renew the key for the following day. No big deal.

Our second room was much cleaner. I was kind of annoyed that the housekeeper didn't replace the ice bucket liner or coffee cups, but again, not a huge issue. I also noticed that breakfast room service carts were still in the hallway when I returned around dinner time.

Day 3: boyfriend went down in the morning to get the keys renewed as instructed. No sweat. Hours later, we return and guess what? Locked out again. And so history repeated itself and we made the trek down the slow elevators once more. 

Luckily, thanks to the MyVegas reward, our room per night cost about the same as a hand or two of blackjack. But, don't forget about the resort fee... which includes wifi... On the first 2 floors of the hotel only. 

We did receive some coupons at check in for free drinks at the casino bar which was a nice consolation prize.

The casino area seemed nice enough. I don't gamble so I'm going off what I saw while walking by.

I ate at two restaurants during my stay, The Cafe and The Market City Caffe, and they were both great. The Cafe is like an upscale 24 hour cafe. I got a chicken burger with a baked potatoe on the side and it was delish. The Market City Caffe is an Italian restaurant. I had the macaroni and cheese with bacon. It was very good and filling. I would recommend both of these places.

It's the rooms that kill the Monte Carlo for me. The beds are fine but they give you these two litle pillows with them that are completely flat and maybe just bigger than 11x14. I kid you not. I was like seriously? These are the pillows? Also, the plumbing is really loud. I know that when you stay in Vegas you can sometimes hear people in the room next to yours, but you shouldn't have to hear when they turn on the sink. My ironing board was broken and the iron was so old that it didn't have a steam function on it. Boo!

If you want a great, affordable hotel room, stay at the MGM. The pillows were fat and firm and you get 4 per bed. I didn't have to hear anyone flush their toilet, and they actually put thought into the interior design of the room. It's very 1920's Hollywood. And they have Emeril's Seafood Restaurant.

It's in good walking location of strip but the they are having construction going on right by the hotel and car entrance is a little bit tricky. 
Guests can walk to Aria and City Center from the hotel where they can take tram to Crystal shops and\/or Bellagio.
We didn't have eat at the buffet but took a look inside, food looks alright but not much variety comparing to the bigger buffets in Vegas. (we ended up having dinner at Bellagio buffet)
There was a looooooong line at the front desk for the check-in but staff were friendly and willing to help. They have luggage storage for 1 day for free in case your room is not ready or you are checking earlier than normal check-in time and then they'll contact you (text probably) once the room is ready.
Hotel has 1 pool, 1 lazy river, one wave pool and 1 hot tub with beach volleyball. It's kind of behind the main building and goes to shade almost as quickly as around the early afternoon. (only some parts stay sun-lid afterwards)
Lazy river tubes are for rent for 5 dollars with no time limit. Pool side bar is nice with lovely people always smiling at you and bringing your order as soon as they can. Towels are available at no cost.
there is a $22-23 resort fee per room per night which includes 2 bottle of water daily and wired internet at your room. You'd be able to connect to Wi-Fi only on 1st and 2nd floor.

This hotel looks older than many of the others. Very apparent in the bathrooms. The lobby smells very strange. Not bad, but not good at all either. Oh, and walking down to the blvd on the New York New York side smells horrible. Dumpsters out there so hold your nose if you try it. The room smelled weird too. Almost like a bad fruity spray or air freshener. Overall, just lots of weird smells in this place.

The fact that this hotel connects to the Tram is its biggest asset by far. Tram stops are Crystals\/Aria and the Bellagio. The location on the strip isn't too shabby itself just below city center. There was a CVS\/Walgreens across the blvd.

The pool starts playing music around 8:30am. Strange since 1\/3 of the rooms are effected by this. 10am seems much more appropriate, maybe even 12pm. Why music so early??? Pool area has a lazy river and sand volleyball, among the typical Vegas pool amenities.

We caught the Blue Man Group show the first night. There is a 'parade' through the casino (without the blue men) featuring a few props from the show. Kinda cool to see. Not huge though, less than 15 people\/things in the parade.

In the last three years I have had to return to Las Vegas for a conference in March and i have not found a better hotel for less money and on the strip than the Monte Carlo. 

Consistently the rooms during the week are in the 50.00 per night range and with that you get very little in the way of perks. In the pat you would get a couple of free lunch and breakfast coupons. This year the coupons were not really usable for me as they were buy one get one free offers that don't work when traveling solo.

This year they charge a 12.00 resort fee that includes wired internet in the room and a couple of bottles of water plus a free newspaper in the morning. It actually worked for me as the internet charge used to be about 14.00 per day.

The rooms themselves are basically what you expect. They are clean but not very modern. The TV has very limited channels and the one in my room was extremely noisy when turned on oh and these are televisions not flat screens. 

The beds are not what I would call comfortable but considering how tired you usually are in Vegas they are all right and the bathroom has good water pressure.

So, somewhere around midnight my very sober trio stumbled into Bellagio.

So we got the heck out of there and trammed it down the way and my still very sober trio stumbled into Monte Carlo where the minimum wasn't $5 like the gold digging Bellagio, it was $3, and within 5 minutes of sitting were asked if we wanted a drink.  

MC was better ventilated, lower minimums, and over the course of an hour an a half I finished a six pack of new castle. That earns 4 stars in my book. With a good deal Karey R. and I may even consider staying here. Goes to show how important booze are when your name is Mary C.",9,7,8

Tons of construction\/renovation showing -- whole banks of roped off, out of service slots; dry wall repairs; other curtained\/cordoned rooms and alcoves still getting the makeover, etc. Standard room was fine for sleeping, but not at all comfortable to hang out in. 

Great pool area. 

Mediocre restaurants -- enough to make you choose the M.C.'s Food Court a time or two.

Many counterbalancing pros and cons, with price being the ""pro"" that wins it 3 stars vs. 2 stars, at least for those concerned with price.",0,0,1

Having stayed at many Las Vegas hotels I would say I would stay here again if I needed to be budget conscious, however, not if I was looking for amenities and service. 

We arrived at the hotel a little after 1 in the afternoon and waited in a small line, with no organization what so ever. We had two rooms and asked if they could be next to each other.  She was able to place us across the hall from each other. Perfect! The first room was done and she was charging the second room when my credit card wouldn't process. This didn't make any sense because there was a thousand dollars available and they were only charging $150 for the remaining balance. I proceeded to give her two other cards which she could not process either (which by the way were able to be used every where else for the remainder of the weekend) and finally just had to give her cash to get things over with.  When I got back home after that weekend it turned out she had charged me $800 for the first room.

One room had a view of the pool and the other room of the parking lot. I choose the one with the pool of course! They have a dj during the day so you can hear music playing but not too loud in the room that you can't sleep in or take a nap.  Decent sized room and a typical bathroom.  Clean and very acceptable, especially for the price.  Luckily, they had a ihome system because we had forgotten speakers for our ipod.  Pretty satisfied for $250 for two nights but then I went to wash my hands and the sink is leaking all over.  I immediately called maintenance and they said they would send someone right up. We needed ice for our drinks so we went to the ice machine and it was broken so we had to go to the next floor.  This ended up being a hassle later in the night when 2 of the other floors ended up being out of ice and we had to visit 4 floors before finally getting some.  No big deal though these things happen.  

After going out for the night and when we got back to the hotel room the key wasn't working. Which also happened two other times for both rooms... not sure why, it wasn't next to cellphones or credit cards. In fact, one had only been sitting on the dresser and still ended up not working.  Not being able to get into your room when all you want to do is sleep is sure to get you grumpy.  We get back to the room and find out that the sink still hadn't been fixed and when I turned on the shower the shower head was pointed out and sprayed all over the floor. Simple things to keep guest happy that can be changed.

We went down to the pool and it's a pretty nice atmosphere. The lazy river is all we wanted to do and it's $10 to rent an inner tube or $10 to buy a small or $15 to buy a large. I just bought one incase we were going to come back later.  Although, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it now... There was lots of families and older couples, not really the place you're going to meet a sexy guy or chick. Overall it was nice and relaxing.

We didn't gamble at all, though the casino wasn't very happening.  The food court is quick and there is a good variety. The promoters were pushing the lounge, open bar for ladies, we weren't interested though.

I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't impressed.",5,0,0

Yes maybe this hotel is below average when compared to aria,bellagio, mgm or ceasars. But you have paid at least 1\/4th of their price. I mean at least! For the time i am here it is 1\/6 of bellagios price. You are not buying the rooms. You are just sleeping there. Probably not awake enough to live in. Unless there is mold or bugs around it it shouldn't be a problem.the fridge issue. Most hotels don't have fridge here. Even if they have they are subject to a fee. Foe god sake you are coming here to gamle. Not spa relaxation.They give you pree pass to all m hotels discounts for shows and food. And waiting time for check in.... did you see other hotels that usually get 5 stars. Such as bellagio. There was an infinite line for check in at 11:00p.m  so how would you feel if you paid 200 bucks+resort fee and wait in the line forever. If you want quiet hotel,you should get a motel.

Parking was $8 for guests. $15 parking fee for non-guests. 

For the hotel room price, I definitely think the room could have been much better but it was still cheaper than the other competitor hotels in that stretch. My gripe about the resort fee is that the pool and lazy river is closed during the winter (went in early February) and we didn't use the gym. So for us to pay the resort fee that maintains all those amenities is pretty dumb. 

I would suggest a cheaper resort fee rate when half of your resort amenities aren't even available to the guests. I give them 3 stars because the hotel casino doesn't wreak of cigarettes, the customer service was really good, we got late check-out (12pm), and the location of the hotel is really nice when accessing the strip. If I stayed here again, it would probably be a more of a deluxe or suite room because their basic room wasn't great but for the price, it was decent.",1,0,0

Chose the Monte Carlo for the rate, they have a Starbucks, the lazy river and location on the strip.  We went for my daughters 21st birthday.  Used the free valet when we arrived, bellman took our bags and we went to check-in right at 3:00 pm.  I had requested 3 rooms together with 1 king and 2 double queens.  No king beds were available (cleaned) at our check in time and the closest they could get our rooms was 320, 324 and 332 down a hallway.  Bellman was very quick to bring our bags to our rooms and off we went.  We were trying to get out to the strip and couldn't find any signage to lead us in the right direction.  We made it eventually.  

iHome in each room, nice TV, very comfortable beds.

Rooms were average but I'd say ours hadn't been vacuumed, no wi-fi but there is a wired connection, hair dryers are in a bag inside the closet (had to call housekeeping about this).  

Casino only serves Pepsi (YUCK) but fortunately there is a McDonald's in the food court where I could get Diet Coke.  

Food Court was small but covers all bases:  Subway, Starbucks, Sbarro, Rubios and McDonald's (think I got those correct).  Line at Starbucks is LONG but there's a second Starbucks if you head towards the tram that goes to the Bellagio. 

The Buffet - kind of pricey and the food was average (pepsi only).  

The Cafe - we had breakfast there and the food was good (pepsi only). 

The Pub - we went in for dinner at 9:00 pm on Saturday night to hear the dueling pianos.  We weren't very hungry and only ordered appetizers which were tasty.  The place was not busy at all, the piano guys were asking for birthdays, anniversaries, etc so I wrote down it was my daughters 21st birthday with her name and put $3 or $4 dollars in the tip jar.  They never mentioned her even though they were begging for suggestions, etc.  I guess you need to hand the guy the money at the same time as the 'ticket' and if it's not enough money forget it they don't mention you.

The Pool - is a very cramped area.  It was hard to find chairs but we walked around and saw a group leaving.  The ""lazy river"" is very small, you have to rent the tubes, or walk around the river and the water was cold.  We went in the bigger pool which was in the shade the whole time we were out there but was comfortable except for children running around. Never saw a waitress (11:30 am on a Saturday) so my sister went to the bar and it took 15-20 minutes to get a drink. 

We'd go back for a good deal and due to the location, especially since the beds were comfortable.",0,0,0

I mean, this hotel is okay but there are some things that I did not like.  Check in was a breeze.  We booked our hotel a month in advanced so there was a great offer that came with the rooms we booked.  Two free complimentary buffet tickets for each room that we booked which means a total of 4!  Okay so this deal sold us into booking the rooms.  As we checked in, the tickets were explained to us that the buffet for lunch was free but there would be an additional cost for dinner.  WHAT?! I thought it was free! LAME!!  They did also give us some vouchers to other buffets to use if we did not want to eat at Monte Carlo. It was a voucher of $33 a person each so we decided to eat at Cravings at Mirage.  

Got to our rooms, first thing we had to do was pee since it was a long drive.. TOILET did not flush!!!  Called a person to come fix it and after a few minutes, it was fixed.  Brought some food from home and there is no fridge :(  That is something I think should be in all hotels!  View was horrible.  Got a view of the rooftops of other buildings.  Took a shower, and the towel that I got had dirty stains on it :(  GROSS!  Just wiped that towel all over my body!

The only good thing I thought was the pool.  It was definitely not a party scene which I like because all I want to do is relax and get a nice tan.  Great lazy pool, although it does cost money to rent a donut tube ($12 for a small, $15 for a big one).  There is also a mini tidal wave in another pool as well, and there is also sand and a volleyball net around the corner.  Lots of shade if you don't like the sun but there is definitely chairs for you to get a tan where there are not trees.  Feeling hot from the sun, they have self served water in paper cone cups too!  I'd definitely take kids here.  They would have fun.

Overall, the stay wasn't too bad but for a cheap price, I'd expect that.

-bring your own donut tube for the pool

-free valet (just tip them)

It's on the strip with a CVS next door and Walgreen's across the street. The staff are usually very friendly and accomodating.  We got a end unit room on the 20th floor with a view of the pool and stayed from Thurs-Sun during MLK weekend.  The layout of the room was very spacious.  What I noticed on this trip that I didn't notice before was the restroom is a little run down.  I saw signs of age along the bathtub and floor in the restroom.  But this wasn't a deal breaker for me.  They are building some new shops\/restaurants on the side where CVS is located which is pretty exciting.  What I like best about this hotel is the food court in the lobby and the tram that you can take to Aria and Bellagio.  The food court has a Mc Donald's and some other fast food restaurants.  There's a Starbucks along the walkway to the trams.  It's super convenient and quick to take the trams to the other hotels which is a bonus.

As somebody mentioned the check in is ridiculous, huge long lines clogging up the lobby.  Everywhere you go in the hotel you are swarmed with sketchy looking people trying to slap a wrist band on you and promising a fabulous night at the Brand nightclub (DON'T do it!!  Nasty crowded little meat market.  They promised a $20 cover and free drinks for the ladies but the drinks list is very limited and the alcohol was rotten, definitely bottom shelf.  Oh yeah, and $30 cover and full drink prices for the men.)  I rented a Monaco suite which looked nice at first glance until I started to notice that there were a lot of holes and gouges in the furniture.  My hot water didn't work several times and there was no safe in the room as promised.  My room overlooked the pool so from about noon to 7pm the blaring music, drunken shrieks and thumping bass from the pool area made it unbearable to relax or have a nap (sometimes you need a nap in Vegas LOL).

The pros:  good location, handy food court, great maid service and awesome pool area.  I really liked Diablo's, the food was good and margaritas on the patio facing the Strip is pretty awesome.

The cons;  Crazy busy hotel, busy 24\/7 and swarms of rowdy drunk people everywhere.  I guess that's a Vegas thing but there were a few times I waited for another elevator instead of getting in alone with a group of drunken men.  The creepy men lurking in the elevator lobby trying to slap brand wrist bands on me were a definite negative.  Hotel is a bit run down in places.

All in all I would  not stay at Monte Carlo again but that's just me - I'm definitely a quiet person and would like somewhere a bit more sedate where I don't run the risk of getting puked on in the elevator LOL .

I was wrong. Traumatizing is when you wake up in a smoking room, that REEKS of smoke when you booked a non-smoking room and find out that the comforter you were sleeping in had blood streaks all over the inside.

Calling through my mLife promotions for the best rate, I landed at the Monte Carlo and got a great room for $39\/night.  (Plus their $15 resort fee, but I'd been paying that much for internet each day at the Flamingo..  soooo..  it kind of evened out.)

Check-in was a breeze, although I could see it being a totally different experience if it were crowded.  There were no formal lines or queue.  You just sort of found your way to a desk agent and were helped.  Mine was extra friendly and fast (what is it about Vegas hotels and airport gate agents that require 15 minutes of typing to process anything?!)  I was given a room on the 19th floor on the east spoke (MC is in the traditional 3-spoke ground plan that Mirage and TI are also in.)  I had an awesome view of the mountains and the backsides of NYNY, Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

Now, it may have been in comparison to the torture device that I'd spent the last two nights in, but the bed here was so much nicer!  Nicer linens and a big comforter!

Room was spot on in size (though, no huge.)  I imagine if it had been a 2 queen room it might have felt cramped.

The bathroom was spacious and didn't feel like I was crammed into it.  My only complaint was the shower.  Several other people have noted this and I have to agree ---  the water pressure on the shower feels like you're getting sandblasted!  OUCH!

I enjoy the Monte Carlo's gaming floor and have always done well.  Their choice of dining options is enough to satisfy most appetites, but if you can't find what you're looking for here, the MC is connected via free tram to Aria\/CityCenter\/Bellagio\/Cosmo, and NYNY is a 3 minute walk.

Food options: 4\/5   -   Chinese restaurant was super yummy.  Always a stop for us whenever we're in town (5\/5).  Food court has a good selection that's open late, so when our nieces\/nephews are around it's nice to have a cheaper alternative to feed them, as opposed to a buffet (McDonalds, Rubios & all that jazz, 4\/5).  Buffet we shall never be back to, not worth the money, and actually, not a good buffet at any price.  Not enough selection, seating is crazy and service is always slow (2\/5).

Casino floor:  3\/5  -  Tables are sometimes packed, and players rewards don't work the same way across all games\/tables, which is weird because it doesn't match the way you accrue at the other MGM casinos (the ones linked onto MLife), but, c'est la vie.  Slot machines are available in a good amount of options with max bets not too ridiculously high.  I've never been that lucky (yet, knock on wood) at this casino, but definitely have survived.

Hotel (all around):  4\/5  -  Staff are always really friendly.  Housekeeping was always courteous when we would ask for extra items.  Bell desk was super fast.  Extra beds (when necessary) were brought up immediately.  Front desk associates are also nice and always try to get us a good room.  Parking is convenient and valet was always prompt.  Lobby area is very nice and appealing.

Hotel (room): 2\/5  -  For a comp'd suite, the last room we got was a joke.  Things were falling apart (the toilet paper dispenser was not screwed into the wall), items were missing and it was just a disarray of items.  It was really shocking to see such a room existed in a hotel that looks classy overall.  The other more modern rooms we have stayed at were much better, surprised that they considered this one to be a suite.

Overall, we'd be back if this was the only comp place we could get.  But not by choice.  Use promos & players club to get better rates here.  Wouldn't pay the normal rates (even the expedia or other online specials) - it pays to sign up (it's free!).",2,0,0

As long as there's a clean bed, I'm good to go. Plus, the service here was ridiculously nice - every time we asked for something (which was a lot for a group of girls),  we got it promptly and with a smile.

Upon check in I found out the pool is under construction and so you have to go up the strip to MGM or Mandalay Bay in your bathing suit to use their pool. Why would the hotel do construction on their pool in the summer time doesn't make any sense. So everyone is walking the strip in their bathing suits real nice and very inconvenient.  Then after going to bed at 5 am because it is vegas after all we were woken up at 6 am by drilling and jack hammering. Our room was fifth floor right above a large construction site. Are you kidding me the hotel is charging us 40$ a night resort fee and there is no pool and construction at 6 am this isn't a resort. I called the desk and a very angry person after hearing my complaints said it should have been in your email about the pool and construction. I'm sorry it wasn't I booked in march, she said well we can move you but it won't be until later in the day. That turned out to be 6 pm after returning from the Mandalay Bay in my bathing suit. Anyways we moved rooms and then then next morning we were woken up to drilling and hammering at 8 am and when I called the desk again they said I don't know why there is no construction on the weekend. I said would you like to come up to my room because I beg to differ. After all was said and done they comped us for our Troubles but it was too late we were absolutely exhausted and they only moved us and comped us because we insisted on talking to the manager and complained so much. When I got home my credit card had charges on it and I had to call them back and argue that I was supposed to be comped.
Over all I will say I'm sure the hotel will look great once all the construction is done but until then I will not return to the Monte Carlo unless I'm invited back when all the construction is done and they comp me to make up for the worst experience in Vegas ever.",1,0,0

But this was actually the first place I stayed at in Vegas & you def. get what you pay for.  Our room was decent, decor a bit boring, but we got the basic so didn't really expect much. From the outside, I would expect the interior to look a little more grand but it's whatever. The location was kind of nice, there was a bar right outside of the hotel and a 24 hour walgreens. It was also kind of in the middle of the strip so it was nice to go on strolls. We had a complimentary buffets and gym usage so that was kind of nice.

Right when we walked into the room, there were French fries on the ground in the middle of the room! Not tucked in a corner but clearly out in the open. There were also paper receipts from the previous guests on the floor too. Due to this, we felt uneasy about the sheets so we requested housekeeping to come change them. We happen to be watching as the housekeepers were changing the sheets and found a set of apple headphones in between the top sheet and fitted sheet. The housekeepers tried to pocket it quickly so we wouldn't notice, but I did. That clearly tells me that these sheets were never changed. I can forgive the stains all over the wall, the pealing floor in the bathroom, and even the un-vacuumed floors. But there is nothing more disgusting than a used dirty bed in Vegas, especially since I have my 9yr old and 2 yr old staying in this room. 

I see Monte Carlo representatives responding to these negative reviews and apologizing. But like my husband and I tell our oldest child; apologies are just words of you don't do anything to make it right! We will continue our stay throughout the weekend but we will never be back again. I've stayed at several casinos along the strip (some even less expensive) and they were much better quality! If you're on the fence, do yourself a favor and chose any other casino.",2,0,0

Room: not luxurious, but clean and spacious. Stayed on the 14th floor. Awesome view of the pool and the mountains in the distance. King sized bed was verrrrrry comfortable. The bathroom was nothing spectacular and yes, the shower pressure is sorta too strong. 
Noise: Yes, I could hear people next door and out in the hallway. Additionally there seems to be a pool party on Saturdays starting at noon, complete with very very loud music, jubilant hostess and a hot dog contest! However, this wasn't a deal breaker.

Pool:Beautiful, get there early to get a spot in a corner away from the action if you want peace and quiet.

Casino- Casino was smaller than a lot of casinos on the strip, but its easy to navigate, very wide variety of slots to play and had tables to suit any player.

First when we arrived we learned that MGM was changing the name of the place and construction had begun with a complete remodel. Place was a mess on the outside

Then after getting into our ""deluxe "" room what a shock to see how small it was and quite dingy. The smell of smoking was prevalent throughout the room but yeah I know it's a casino. 

The slots here were so tight it held a death grip on your money. Hardly anyone was winning and again the cigarette smoke was awful. Poor air quality through out the building. 

The table games were outrageous 25 blackjack 10 minimum on most card games with about 30.00 a hand to get through most deals. And I watched as most money was collected by the house. But thats gambling. 

They close the pools at 7pm. Why?? It was 110* outside and they close the pool crazy!!

Made my way over to MGM grand and enjoyed the casino much more. Won a little but had fun. Cigarette smoke was not that bad there. 

Caught the KA show and it was great. Spent 5 days in Vegas and I can say its not the Vegas I remember from 6-7 years ago. Cost much more to play. Food was outrageous. Town had more beggars and bums than anyplace I have seen.

The lobby is very pretty and has that older style and class to it that my parents liked very much. The hotel has a really nice smell to it, not all smoky like other hotels. 

Rooms:

- Older so there is normal wear and tear.
- Loud flushing toilet because of Las Vegas's high elevation
- Terrible toiletries -- not a very good quality at all
- TV has very limited channels and doesn't have my beloved Food Network
- Very soft bed, which was bad news for my back, which requires a firmer mattress
- The rooms (I had two -- one for me and my husband, the other for my in-laws) all smelled of stale cigarettes, even though we had non-smoking rooms. I'm assuming it's because some jerks smoked anyway or because the smoke traveled through the vents
- Great view of the pools and part of the strip
- Showers are OLD.

Pool:

Better attractions than most hotels. There was a wave pool, a lazy river, a regular pool, and a smaller kiddie pool (maybe it was a jacuzzi -- I didn't get in that pool to verify). The pools are a lot smaller than the pools (including the wave pool and lazy river) at other hotels, particularly the similar pools at Mandalay Bay. Towels are a bit old and run down. Very small bar. and ""gift\/pool shop.""

Hotel\/Casino\/Buffet:

Eh, the buffet was okay, but there are much better places to eat to your heart's content in Vegas.

The casino itself is really small and is a lot smaller than other hotels' casinos on the strip. There weren't a lot of slot machines or card tables. There is a poker room, though, so that was nice.

The food court is really small, and there was nothing special. 

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the tram to Bellagio\/Aria. You can also walk to Aria without going outside. Big pluses. 

I'm not sure if we'll stay here again, because it is a bit off-center of the strip, but having a tram to Bellagio makes it okay. Also, there are a lot of great hotels on the strip, but this place is a pretty great deal if you're in a pinch or need a place at the last minute. It's a lot better than Luxor or Excalibur, so I'd definitely stay here over those hotels.",0,0,0

I remembered my first visit to the Monte Carlo 5 years prior as being a very nice comfortable hotel that lacked that Vegas umph. This time around I had to take off a star. 

First off it took us maybe 40 minutes to check in. Lines were long and they were understaffed. Once checked in we were shocked to see how run down the room was. It was dirty. Dirty towels, dirty tub, and dirty floors. We asked for a new room and right away they sent a bellman to take our bags to our new room. Between waiting in line and changing rooms it took us almost two hours to settle in. 

The room was clean but run down. No glasses to go with the ice buckets which is no big deal as I just called room service to have them delivered but the lack of attention to detail showed me that the Monte Carlo had gone down quality wise. 

Every morning we woke up to dance music at 9am that was being played poolside. Nothing wrong with music by why is a DJ blaring music at 9am? We never were able to sleep-in. Last thing I want to do is party late into the night to be woken up at 9am. 

The only good thing was the price. Priceline offered a 110 dollar a night special that included a free buffet for the both of us every day.

Booked a package through Orbitz that included flights and hotel stay.  After being there...I discovered why the price was so low.
Found out that my package price didn't include ""resort fees"" (or something like that) and I had to pay another $80 or so upon check in.  That's more of an issue with Orbitz than the hotel, but that's how my stay started.

Didn't have any major issues with the room.  Not much to it...no refrigerator or microwave.  Lights in the entryway were burned out, which made for a problematic first entry.  But this was fixed quickly after a phone call to the desk.

The real issue was foodservice.  Literally half of the restaurants were closed down.  I understand restaurants may need to close periodically for renovations or cleaning, but closing  everything at once was a problem.  It made every other location swamped with people, which led to long waits and poor service.
There are two Starbucks locations...but one was closed.  That led to a 20 minute wait in the morning to order coffee.  When I finally get to the front...they're out of soymilk.  That left my lactose-intolerant girlfriend out of luck and left me wanting a 1\/2 hour of my life back.

When looking for dinner one night, we walked to two locations that were closed.  No master list anywhere that we could find as to what was open and what wasn't.  Not wanting to waste anymore time walking around, we asked the concierge.  He directed us to a cantina that was open.  It was literally at the furthest point away from the hotel from the desk.  We walked about 10-15 minutes down there...and......you guessed it....it's closed too.

We ended up leaving the hotel for dinner...and I made a specific point to go to a non-MGM Owned hotel.

Monte Carlo Management: 
1.) Don't close all your foodservice at the same time. It's very frustrating to your guests. 
2.) If you do...train your staff correctly.  If they don't know what's open...how do your guests?


Just saw the response from the hotel manager.  Totally avoids the issue of the concierge directing us to a place that was closed...and apparently they have no plans to change their seasonal closure practices.  Solidifies my decision to avoid this place (and every other MGM-owned hotel) like the plague!",0,0,0

It's four-star hotel rating is a bit inflated (as with all of Las Vegas), but it's also cheaper than four-star hotels elsewhere (again a feature of Las Vegas), so it all works out in the end. Amenities include TV, a safe, and wired internet. The safe is large enough to hold a laptop or a small purse, but anything larger (like a backpack) won't fit. Since the internet is wired, be sure to bring a laptop if you want to use the internet. Your smartphone\/tablet won't work. With the way the economy is going, they probably haven't had the money to upgrade to wifi. The interior decor is OK, maybe more like a three-star hotel, but the lobby is quite opulent.

The parking structure is across the street, with a second-floor sky bridge connecting them. When you enter through the sky bridge, you will first go down an escalator to get to the lobby, then proceed to the elevators which is also where the casino entrance is.

When booking, you can pay extra for a high-floor (21+)* room for a better view and even more for a high-floor room with a view of the Strip.

I'm not kidding - really, they must put something in the air vents to make it smell nice and fragrant no matter where you are. 

My company takes good care of us when we're out so I had one of the business suites to myself, up on the 18th floor with a great location by the elevators and a really nice view outside. The room was always clean and comfortable, and I had fun ordering room service a couple of times - which wasn't any more highly priced than other four-star hotels. 

I like the setup of the Monte Carlo with the casino nested between a food court and with several restaurants lining it. It felt very Vegas-y to me, for lack of a better way to put it, like something you'd expect Vegas to be. I was there for business so I didn't get out to really explore the casino and bars, but I liked the atmosphere a lot. 

My only complaint is that I'm currently dealing with a misplaced charge on my credit card courtesy of the hotel itself - several hundred dollars that shouldn't be there - and I had a rather rude girl from the MGM accounts receivable department smart off to me over the phone. That isn't something I appreciate, but I've got both my company and my credit card company involved, so that will be sorted. Nothing against the Monte Carlo itself, though - the staff were friendly, attentive, and charming.

For many years, we stayed at the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino in Downtown Las Vegas but for the last two years, we have stayed on the strip trying a new hotel each time.
Our annual trip to Vegas unbelievably is not about the gambling but rather the entertainment, dining and relaxation; a key piece of our trip is about relaxing in the sun by the pool.  I love laying by the pool from 10 am until 4:30 pm drinking, reading, swimming, eating lunch, sleeping on and off and basically just being lazy.  When home I am not the type of person ever to ""sit still"" but my yearly mecca to Vegas is the one and only time of year where I do nothing absolutely ""N-O-T-H-I-N-G"" and love every minute of it.
This years' trip took us to the Monte Carlo.  I booked our trip through Southwest Airlines Jackpot Deals.  I have to say I expected more from my stay at the Monte Carlo and was so disappointed that I called Southwest Airlines Jackpot Deals two days into our trip (we were staying for a total of 4 nights and 5 days) and asked if we could change hotels.  After the Southwest Airlines Rep spoke with Monte Carlo Reservations, we were told we could move to a different hotel and that we would receive a refund for the remaining time we would have stayed at the Monte Carlo.
The pool area was rather disappointing.  The whole flow or feng shui of the pool layout was not welcoming; the position of almost all lounge chairs face away from the pools except for the pool that is shaded throughout the entire day.  The wave tech pool was a complete disappointment.  It was too short to really get any true waves going within the center of the pool.  They have a volleyball area, which I personally, think is silly.  Why not make a giant wave tech pool forgo the volleyball area and put some lounge chairs in the shallow area of the pool like at the Golden Nugget or Mandalay Bay.  Place a few tables for gambling and a bar.  The music was much too loud for the small pool area.
As for our guest room the furniture was cheap thin wood had a feeling of being rickety, the mattress was very uncomfortable and there was not any Wi-Fi available in the room.  I found this so astonishing!  It is not as if WI-FI service in hotels is not common or has not been available for quite a few years nor were we traveling in Europe where I would be surprised at any sort of frequency of WI-FI accessibility.  This is 2013; almost everyone has a smart phone and some sort of table.  I was shocked.
I think it is absurd to complain about check-in and out lines in Vegas so yes we waited in line for a long time, is this an anomaly in any sense, no this is quite common at all properties all over Vegas except if you are staying off the strip then you probably will not have to wait long at all.
The feel of the hotel is okay.  Again, it is not really luxurious or stunning in any way.

My initial thoughts about staying was a little iffy, but after my stay, I am definitely sold on Monte Carlo as an inexpensive hotel to stay at that offers a great location on the strip and good comfortable rooms to sleep in.

I have stayed at the MGM tower too many times to count and the east tower at the Luxor so it was awesome to find out that the rooms at the Monte Carlo are comparable. Similar furniture, similar bed, similar layout to the room. I say similar because they is definitely a difference and I definitely prefer MGM, but it is close enough especially when taking price into account. Apparently, Monte Carlo had gone through a remodel in recent years and it looks they will benefit from it because I liked the rooms here.

The casino is smaller than some of the other hotels but they do have pretty much everything you could want. Roulette, video poker, that annoying Wheel of Fortune game and etc. Restaurant wise they have only few choices but there is variety and they seem fairly decent (we did eat at a couple of them.

I admit I was sort of dreading staying here with all the crummy reviews, but it was chosen for a big (BIG) group of friends to go to Vegas and the price was right. It was better than I expected in some ways (cleaner, the room was quiet enough, there was no mold that I could see in our bathroom, the location is aces, convenient food court and amenities), and worse in others (no fridge in the room, no coffee maker in the room, thin\/cheap towels, squashy-in-the-bad-way bed, inconsistent service on property). It is, as one of my friends sagely pointed out, the Holiday Inn of the Strip. No frills, but a good location, and does the job. If you're not going to be in your hotel room much this might be a good spot for you.

We had a room on the 19th floor facing the new arena. With two nights of a George Strait concert, it was audibly busy in the evenings, but it was fine. That said, I don't know how the lower rooms or the rooms facing the pool do it. The pool music is blasting from the early morning hours and it is LOUD. Something to consider when reserving a room. 

Service at the Pub, Brand, and the pool was mixed, but mostly not great. Service at Double Barrel was really good. 

That said, the management at the pool was EXCELLENT. We reserved one of the lounge areas our first day, and we had terrible service. My friend spoke to the manager, who knocked $100 off the bill AND comped us the VIP cabana and private pool for the next day! The manager came over to check on us to make sure we were doing okay, and the service was perfect. It was much faster (no waiting 90+ minute for one order of chicken fingers), and hey guess what? As a result we spent WAY more money. Everyone wins. (And let me tell you, if you have enough people to split it and make the price right, do yourselves a favor and reserve that VIP pool. It was so great and became the talk of the trip.)

Nice! So my friend and I ventured through the hotel to get a feel and grabbed a bite in the food court. Then it was off to the pool!
The pool was awesome. There is a DJ there on Saturdays and Sundays. I wish it was all week long because the pool wasnt the same on Monday as on Sunday. Don't get me wrong, I love kids, I have 6 year old twins myself but Vegas is NOT the place for them. I noticed a lot of kids at the Monte Carlo pool. The lazy river is not the place to teach your kids how to swim. Whats nice is you can walk around the lazy river or stand at the side and drink. Not everyone is in a tube. Drinks are expensive. But its Vegas. 

The room was clean. Nice. There was some wallpaper peeling in the bathroom. But I'd give the room 4 stars.

shower was fantastic, great water pressure

free internet (provided ethernet).

SERVICE:

We made several calls for various things and I was shocked at how quickly they fulfilled the requests. new pillows? pronto. more towels? well be right there. the phone was always answered and they are obviously well-organized.

*One gripe is that on the only day we wanted housekeeping and took the ""do not disturb"" off our door, we did not receive it :( came home late at nite to find our rooms still a mess. would have been fantastic sleeping in clean sheets and a made bed :-\/ ironically every day we didn't want service (and forgot the sign), they tried to come about 5 times.

FOOD:

Didn't eat in any of the restaurants but we did partake in room service a few times :) Actually pretty reasonably priced and delicious. $12 for a grilled chicken sandwich with bacon, avocado cheese and all the fixins' was not a regrettable choice. During peak hours you do need to be patient. I think it took about an hour to receive.

There is a good food court as well with plenty of options and fulfills the late night munchies. 

POOL:

I had no idea the pool here was so cool. Lazy river with intertubes and wave pool :D

+1 for including delightful and amusing british gentlemen for our entertainment.

CASINO:

...I have no opinion on this. I do not gamble.

Overall very pleasant experience and I'd definitely stay here again.",8,6,6

We paid a premium price for a strip view, but due to newer hotels blocking the view, our strip view represented about 100 actual yards of the strip.

Even when I was younger, we skipped the Monte Carlo because they didn't have any kid-friendly attractions), so I was pleasantly surprised.  My friend is a hustler (har har) so we were able to get a room for Labor Day weekend.

The room:
A little outdated, but large and comfortable.  The toilet had a crack (i didn't do it!) and the shower head tried to blast all the skin off my body.  There was no refrigerator (boo having to drink warm Four Lokos... ok just kidding, we made our own fridge in the sink :P) and our room was the very end of a long hallway (but not as long a hallway as the Mirage, so still alright!).  It came with free wired internet (which we didn't use because seriously, who doesn't have a blackberry\/iphone\/smart phone by now?) and a binder that advertises the Lance Burton show (haha, didn't that thing get cancelled like 5-10 years ago?).  There was an ipod docking station and 2 phones (which were practically next to each other.  convenient, no?)  Our view was of the pool, which looked pretty awesome actually.  If my friend had brought swim shorts, we would've gone!

The hotel:
Small strip of stores\/restaurants in the ""Boulevard of Dreams"" or whatever its called.  A small food court which included Subway, Starbucks, Sbarros, Hagaan Daz, McDonalds, and some Chinese restaurant.  There were bars\/restaurants scattered through the casino area.  Nothing crazy impressive, except for the minus 5 Ice Lounge (which was overpriced, but still awesome).  Bonus points for having a direct connection to the Aria and a tram that goes to Aria\/Crystals and Bellagio\/Vdara.

First I must say that I am a huge Vegas fan, our family celebrates Thanksgiving in Vegas every year and we have family that flys in from New York, Florida, and Honduras...it's always been something that I look forward to...we start off in a time share and then after the holiday about half of us stay on, always in an MGM property. About 2 years ago I started playing the my Vegas abought the reward on my Vegas after reading the terms and conditions, verifying that it was valid for the intended dates...all good...so then I click the link to book the room at New York, ...it won't let me book for Saturday night. I try calling and am told yep, no Saturday arrivals...as though that was already stated and I'm a moron for asking...I triple checked, it's not stated.   Okay so I ask which reward could I use for Saturday, she says she can't check. .just keep trying . Now beyond irritated.....I ask her which one she thinks would be more likely to have that option...she says Monte Carlo. I buy the reward, then she checks ...nope your out of luck ...but I can book a room, you pay for Saturday and then use the reward for Sunday and Monday...I agree.  ...she starts looking for the rate....I tell her my husband Erick Flores has the credit card from Mlife, will that help...she asks for his Mlife #, quotes the rate of 85. Plus the resort fee, then books the comp room using the reward and we are good to go. We go to check in..h.mm that's odd, they only have the one night....then when she finds the second reservation that reservation is also for only one night for a total of 2 nights....well okay I say to myself surely this is an easy fix, ...flash forward 30 full minutes after she has made several calls to my Vegas to m life to everyone...she hangs up and says, well according to them this is the second time this has happened, there gonna call you later after they investigate...now at this point I'm pretty sure she is insinuating that I've done something...God only knows what...so with dread and like a scolded child I go up to the room...as I walk through the casino I'm shocked to see the tiny little size...wait...and there are no restaurants open, no pool, no spa.....no shopping....and about 1\4 of the casino..the room ...I must say I adored...we go to the room

..shower...then because I have Anxiety disorder and can't stop worrying decide to go to the m life desk ...we are summarily dismissed saying that they don't do reservations. You know, for some reason dismissal by a 19 year old that didn't even have the courtesy to let me finish my sentence made my worry flash to anger...it was a slow flash...about 2 hours later we went back to the m life desk.

..met a ray of sunshine... intelligent, helpful, no nonsense sweet heart who fixed the problem, explained that the guest services staff doesn't have the access to my Myvegas ...I was so dissatisfied with the State of the Monte Carlo, we left a day earlier anyways so I need not have spent the whole evening in angst

..but I had no idea.... There ought to be a duty to just the general satisfaction of your customer to inform them of the fact that the casino is no resort...with no amenities....we check out...after standing in one long line...are directed to stand in a different line....only after we get to the front....then are asked by the gentleman that stands behind the clerk's...um do you have a question? Yes, we need to check out...he asked the room number...he says he will don't out a receipt ...gets distracted helping someone else...meanwhile this is all with us still in the second line and him still behind the counter...when he remembers us he raises his voice to be heard over the man that being helped properly at the counter..""next time do mobil check out.  (Hahaha) we will send the receipt to your email. 

Cherry on top, we get home...even though it's clearly not justified resort fee charged for 3 nights...what does the resort fee include?...and please don't say Wi-Fi... because my data plan is unlimited...we stayed 2 nights not 3....the 85 dollar rate was not the lowest rate for Saturday night, I don't think they used either Mlife reward # to allow points for the stay and I still have to emailed receipt.

Very polite check-in staff.  She offered us our choice of room location.  She stated that there was ""a little street noise"" if we chose a room with a view of the Strip.  Knowing that this kind of noise is minimal that high up (18-20th floor), we chose one of those rooms since one person in our group had never been to Vegas before.  The room looked okay when we got there, but as time went by we noticed a lot of issues.  The bathroom was not all that pleasant - the bathtub fixtures were mismatched (some silver, some brass), and all were very worn.  The bathtub faucet was actually coming off the wall.  There was wallpaper peeling off the walls as well.  The furniture was worn and the desk chair quite uncomfortable.  The ""decorator"" pillows were worn and dirty, and housekeeping had put them on the bed pillows (yuck!!).  We were rudely awakened by very loud construction noise at 5:00AM!  They are building something next door, and all of the noise was banging on metal - not something that can be slept through.  As we unhappily got up earlier than planned, we found, as each of us took a shower, that the towels are TINY.  The towels are so small, that not one of us could wrap it around ourselves (not even the petite size 2 person).  When we discussed our concerns with the front desk later in the day, their solution was to have ear plugs sent up to our room.  Their new arena was opening that day, and they were much too preoccupied with that to be bothered with complaints about already checked-in guests who couldn't sleep through construction noise.  The ventelation system in the casino is horrible - much more smoky and stinky than many of the other casinos. The pools are pretty basic compared to most other hotels on the Strip.  One person in our group had several hours worth of work with her, but wasn't able to do any of it, as the wi-fi was out for almost the entire second day of our stay.

This left me to wonder whether the guests waiting in the gigantic and growing line behind me were going to be told the same thing and how pissed everyone was going to be, right? My husband asked how that was possible and the chick had the audacity to tell us that technically check is 3 but no one is guaranteed their room until 6 pm!! Seriously?! Then why isn't check in at 6?! That was ridiculous. She must've thought we were stupid or something. She treated us like second class citizens and this really disappointed me. Well after my husband refused to budge, she made a call and magically found a king size bedroom available. She took no responsibility, made no apologies and frankly looked mad at us for some reason! Talk about quality customer service, what a joke! Well she must have had some sort of beef with us because the room we got was awful!

Not offering this is not okay, but I would have tried it again in the future if they would have told us this from the beginning. Instead, they let us reserve a non-existant room. They also charged the card for a deposit fee after the website said no deposit needed.

Literally so loud you couldn't have a conversation. When I tried to call to complain they said they couldn't hear us! Ha exactly my problem. Go any where else this hotel sucks",0,0,0

Monte Carlo is one of the most underrated hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.  I suppose if the room doesn't cost more then your car note per night its not good enough.  Well shame on you, shame.  I have had the pleasure of staying at the Monte Carlo on more then one occasion and let me tell you it does not disappoint.

PRO:  The Smell.  Seriously, it smells sooooo good in this hotel all the time.  I find myself walking through the hallway and casino saying aloud ""OMG it smells so good"".  Even when I'm sober.  Now that's major.

CON:  I completely forget about this place when I'm planning a trip.  I'm so sorry Monte Carlo, I really am.

Funny story.  My cousin and I were on our way out to the club.  Looking cute and stuff.  We get in the elevator, and there.... Is a girl who just got out the pool.  Oh wait, no... she pissed on herself.  Not only is she pissy in the elevator but she keeps saying ""Lance Burton.. Master Magician"".  HILARIOUS.  We still make fun of her to this day.

The rooms here are nice, typical Vegas rooms (that smell really good).

Of course, if the possible get the Monaco Suite.  It is spacious and mid-level luxurious.  Luxury without the price tag of a 5 star hotel.

Stay here, you wont regret it.

Our trip here last year really sticks out in my memory because when we got to the room the toilet had a HAIR on it (actually I think it was 2), and I'm not talking about a hair from your head!  It was extremely disgusting and I called housekeeping right away.  Just shows that they're not cleaning and sanitizing the toilet seat after every guest checks out of that room, which leads me to think well whatelse may they be slacking on?  Sheets!!  I don't even wanna think about it!

So this years trip, forgetting all about the HAIR incident, I decide to book us a room here again, being that it is the most reasonably priced decent casino on the main area of the strip.  We check in, I had a non smoking room with a king sized bed reserved, and they tell me they have no king sized beds available, it's only about 6:30pm, how could they possibly be out already?  WHATEVER, we took the room anyway and check out our 2 queen sized beds, so my hubby and I each get our own bed, okay I'm over it now.  I go in the bathroom, no hair on the seat, but the floor is visibly dirty, gotta give it up for their immaculate housecleaning staff again!  2nd year in a row! 

Needless to say, I doubt we'll be returning to stay at the Monte Carlo again!  EVER!

BTW - when you take a shower, you'll pretty much be standing in a pool of your own dirty water, the drains always seem to be clogged and don't drain fast enough.",2,1,0

On our last trip, however, we planned at the last minute and got the best deal at Monte Carlo ($49 Fri\/Sat, Comped Sun\/Mon).  I really didn't like the fact that they tack on a mandatory $12.95\/day ""resort fee.""  They say it covers use of the pool, local and 800 phone calls, newspaper, printing your boarding pass, and wired internet.  Really, I think these are things that should be included in their normal rate.  Making this additional fee mandatory just puts a sour taste in my mouth...but apparently this is becoming the norm in Vegas.

The location of the hotel on the strip is convenient, especially since they have a tram that goes to Aria and Bellagio.  Check-in at 5 pm was quick and easy.  The front desk staff was friendly and welcoming.  The room itself was basic.  It is a bit run down, but I am glad that they did away with those old bedspreads.  The brass bathroom fixtures showed the age of the hotel.  There was some painters tape left on the walls.  There was no fridge or mini-bar in the room.  The pillows are super firm!  They were so hard and high that I decided to sleep with no pillow under my head.  The walls are also really thin and you can hear any time people walk down the hall, doors opening\/closing, and conversations in the next room.  My parents were kept awake by loud music and partying going on in the room next to them.

The resort itself was pretty good.  We enjoyed the pool and the lounge at Brand Steakhouse.  The ice bar also looked cool, but we didn't want to pay the ~$30\/person entry fee.

Overall, I'd prefer to stay at Palazzo, but Monte Carlo wasn't bad for the price.  I would consider staying here again if I couldn't get a good deal at one of the luxury hotels.",0,0,0

The rooms were clean enough, and you get two free water bottles a day due to the resort fee you pay. So I'd contemplate staying here again, but it's not my first choice.

I'm a decent looking blonde thirty something who works hard! So for vacation, I enjoy relaxing by the pool, cold drink in my hand, and good food (I always include wine as a food group).  I don't want the no party zone but also not quite the full party zone! 

The Monte Carlo is about as stale as my party days! I use to love this place but this time the staff wasn't great, the pool was awful, and of course the food and drinks mediocre at best.

This place is less expensive so I'm not expecting Cosmopolitan or Palazzo rates.  We were looking for a mid week cabana or lazy river day bed (they weren't sold out)  and their rates were astronomical! I spoke to both the pool staff and concierge, both said that's just what it is.  I also informed the staff I had rates less expensive at the Cosmopolitan and the Hard Rock! These other two pools are far more well known than the Monte Carlo!  I ended up at Cosmopolitan's Boulevard pool!  I was in some ways glad it happened as it will forever break my cycle of staying at the Monte Carlo.  The Boulevard pool was that perfect party mix.  30-40 something's, classy, sophisticated, yet fun!  Excellent price and great time!  We spent far more than the Monte Carlo was asking in the long run (food and beverage) but, the food and beverage minimum was much less!  The Boulevard was also far more up to date and beautiful! 
 
Most of the bars at the Monte Carlo also offer cocktails at $20 a piece so you may as well stay at a place worthy of a $20 cocktail.   

The room wasn't just old it was also dirty.  The table lamp only worked if you hit the table due to a short in the lamp, the bathtub was always full of standing water while showering. 

The only perk to the Monte Carlo you can experience without wasting the money to stay in their hotel.  Stay some where else but do visit the Pub,  a restaurant inside the hotel!  Amazing staff and great happy hour!  I appreciated the staff so much in this location!  Rebecca, Paul, Tim, and James were the best part of our stay.

I feel like the Vegas hotel industry is similar to a banking industry though, If you aren't a million dollar account, they don't care. Myself and my friends are likely more than an average stay but less than a huge client (obviously). I've planned many trips to  Vegas for other people as most know I'm pretty familiar.   I won't book myself, a bachelorette party, or anyone else I know at the Monte Carlo! 

I don't complain about noise, drunk people,  or other things that are complimentary of being in Vegas.  I will say this hotel in summary, less expensive stay rate and all else is the same or higher than much more desirable hotels.  I love the location but your better opportunities are next door! 

Good Luck and Happy Vegas

It was nice but you could get a decent price and it had a decent pool. I hadn't stayed her in quite a few years because I felt it had become run down a bit.  I was excited to hear it was being remodeled but quickly disappointed by the cheap quality of the remodel.   The pool was shut down during my stay so they allowed us to go to MGM or Mandalay Bay to go to the pool.  They are nice substitutions but a bit of a pain.  The worst part is the arena being here.  They really needed to put in pedestrian bridges and fencing to keep people out of the street.  I'm not sure why they didn't but every night when the arena lets out you will spend an hour trying to get back to the hotel.  Don't take an Uber or cab here in the evening.  You will never get in.  I also don't like the fact you have to pay to park now.  First was the high resort fee that they added on that doesn't show on their rates online and now you pay for parking.  It is what it is, so I recommend paying the extra $5 a day for valet. Makes it more worth the money since you can park on other properties.  The one positive note is that the employees here are great.  They always willing to help and I appreciate that.  My final conclusion is that I would not stay here again if nothing else because it is so hard to get in at night and the fact it feels cheap now.  The clientele have also changed.  This has become a more bargain location which is I am guessing what the owners wanted.  If you flew in and don't have a car it isn't bad.

This past summer, I decided to venture out on a journey to an oasis in the middle of the desert, called ""Vegas"" to some, but known as ""Sin City"" to many. My roommate and I decided we should try something new for a change, since whenever I am in Vegas, I am seen stumbling around Excalibur, trying to find my room but having no recollection whatsoever wherever it is. I am geographically challenged. So, we decide to stay at Monte Carlo. It looks pleasant enough on the website, and a five hour journey later (give or take an hour), the interior looked impressive.

While waiting in line impatiently, we were slightly spooked because the lady in front of us was rambling about how dirty her room was, and how she filed several complaints about it. She proceeded to fill us in on all the gory details, and I was slightly perturbed. Had we made a mistake? I was tired, and anxious to be in the comfort of my room. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, we were at the front of the line, checking in. I was slightly annoyed, because they were under staffed, and there was no distinct formation...it was all haphazard, to say the very least.

But I was happy on one note. There was a bell hop, and he was happy to serve us. We were also in no mood to find parking, so we went through valet. They were nice guys, so score for that. Anyway, on to the room. When we got to our room, I was content. I immediately flopped on to the bed, and noticed how soft it was. It would do for later on, when I would more than likely be buzzed, and even a cold, hard bathtub would do for a sleeping arrangement. The bathroom was quaint, but the lighting did not flatter, but I was okay with that. There also was a floor length mirror right in front of my bed, and while it wasn't the most flattering...I felt like it added ten pounds...(or was it my endless drinking that caused that?)...it was convenient for when I wanted to straighten my hair.

The first night, a friend joined us from Mandalay Bay, and we were determined to go out, but we were side tracked by a bar. Funnily enough, we never did go to the club we were originally thinking of going to, but spent our night away, getting intoxicated. The bartenders were a blast, and we did not feel sleepy until eight in the morning, when both of their shifts ended. I believe that place was called Ignite Lounge, and while my other friends went out, I was quite content staying within the safety of my casino for the night. It was a ritual throughout the trip, and amazingly enough, I met a couple of regulars that were staying at the Monte Carlo, as well. It transformed in to a kind of ""Cheers"" joint. I also met another fabulous bartender at Hit Lounge, and he entertained me for a couple of hours, talking about Las Vegas shenanigans, and actually told me to come on through later on if I wasn't going out, so we could throw back a couple of shots together. He was an older guy, but boy, he was so fun and relaxed! I suppose this is why I love casino bars. Since I'm from Arizona, and I frequent Scottsdale, I am accustomed to the snooty clientele that the nightlife attracts. I loved the chill factor here.

And lastly, the food. Well, I went to the standard food court. We were supposed to all go to a buffet, but that plan was a bust. It definitely was an improvement to my eating fiasco at Excalibur. My whole diet consisted of a six inch sub from Subway, and that was my ambrosia for my duration of the trip.

Would I come back and stay here? Abso-frockin'-lutely. I would stay here, JUST for the bartenders at Ignite lounge. Cool, cool dudes. We were even supposed to go to a strip club with them, but that will hopefully be another story for next time. Damn you, Vegas! 

PS: And may I add, I guess I had a pleasant stay because of the company I kept here. Remember, it's not the places you go to that counts...it's the people that can make or break an experience.",3,4,2

When it comes down to it, in Vegas the restaurants, casinos, etc are not particularly important in the hotel you are staying at because you can walk for 5 minutes to go next door.  In those terms this hotel is one the best hotels in Vegas because it is cheapish while being perfectly located to quickly get you to the Bellagio, Aria and other much more expensive hotels with better food and casino options. BUT this place also comes with an above average pool that other similarly priced hotels lack. 

It also has a food court with very cheap food options that a lot of other hotels lack.  I will walk a mile to eat at a nice restaurant but it is pretty hard to walk that far for a McDonalds... having the option for some cheap eats helps your wallet while also allowing you not have to spend 1hr+ at every meal.

Monte Carlo is positioned well on the strip next to city center and the T-Mobile arena. A Mono Rail connects the hotel to the Bellagio saving you a lot  of walking time for no cost if you choose to use it. 

Room cost is modest for Las Vegas. The parking garage will cost $8 every 1-4 hours with valet getting you for $10. The parking garage sports overhead lights to inform the driver of an available space. (Incredibly helpful option)

The hotel and casino are a good blend of clean, fun and affordable, offering a pool and Spa in good lad Vegas hotel fashion even sporting a wave pool!

The upgraded room offered for a modest price increase sported a better city view. Worth it unless staring at A\/C roof units is your thing.

 The hotel is a bit out dated compared to the newer more modern hotels on the strip.  The rooms itself are decent size, nothing to fancy about them, small desk, ok tv, bathroom was a bit spacious and beddings were a bit old. A good thing about the hotel is the food court, that is open 24 hrs and all the other resturants that are located downstairs. It gave us peace of mind that we did not have to walk for to grab something to eat. 

Room service was great. We called in for an extra cot ( which was very comfortable, twin size and fit perfectly in the room), small fridge and sewing kits. They were pretty good and speedy about bringing these items to the room.The pool is amazing! They have a reg pool to kick back in, a wave pool, and a lazy river!! The lazy river is the best, just rent or buy a tube and your set for a relaxing ride!

The rooms are standard issue, but it's true that the walls are thin and it's easy to hear everything. Especially the plumbing - showers and flushing toilets are LOUD. We also had the unfortunate experience of having the alarm clock in the next room go off each night at midnight. And of course there is no one in that room, so we had to call Housekeeping to turn it off, which took over 30 minutes each time. Ugh. 

We stayed on the 3rd floor this time, which gave us a hideous view of the roof with all the trash, dead birds and vacuum cleaners on it.

We never got the text and it was kow 3:30 and I had to go to the Concierge, and they just gave access to the room immediately.

I would consider Monte Carlo to be a mid-level Vegas hotel. It's not fancy & nice like the Wynn or Cosmo, where you want all your friends to know that you're staying there. However it does not belong with the Excalibur and Circus Circus class either, where you DON'T want people to come hang out in your hotel room. 

I've stayed at the Monte Carlo a few times now, the most recent being in September. We booked a block of rooms. It was great that they let us check in early (without having to pay a fee like Planet Hollywood) and managed to keep all the rooms on the same floor. 

The room itself definitely needs a face lift. (Hopefully they will get around to it after they have completely the exterior renovations.) You can see the age in the furniture. We stayed in both the Diamond Suite and also the normal Deluxe room. The Deluxe room is your typical hotel room, no frills. The Diamond Suite was of course bigger. Loved the 2 people jacuzzi in the bathroom. The tub literally had 2 spots wide enough for 2 people to be side by side of one another. (Which is great since the typical jacuzzi is much smaller and you can't lay down.) The bedroom is separated from the rest of the suite. The living area had its own separate restroom, along with everything you would expect in a typical living room. There is also a wet bar that came with a mini fridge (not stocked) and a sink.

Nearly all of the hotels on the Strip has imposed the daily resort fee and the Monte Carlo is no different. Internet is included in the cost however the fact that the rooms do not have WiFi makes me not too thrill with having to pay for something that I can not use (there is a hardline that you can use for internet but my iPad and my phone sure as hell don't have those ports!). Aside from the ""internet"",  you get 2 (small) bottles of water and Keurig coffee. 

One thing I do like about the Monte Carlo: LOCATION. It's almost to the center of the Strip and if you forget anything, there is a CVS right next door (food, drinks, souvenir, etc.)

Would I stay here again? Sure, why not. It has the potential to be a great hotel. Hope the remodeling will make it so that it will be a place where I would WANT to book instead of being a backup hotel.",6,2,3

Sure, the rooms are still pretty shabby, and the internet abysmal. But on this trip the casino drinks were really flowing! Did they read my last review? Haha. 

Really, I intended to stay there on my free nights and just walk to Aria to do my gambling, but the frequent drinks kept my ass in their seats! Also, I had a work emergency and a document I had to sign and return to work that day. I could not get on the internet at all in the room, and the business center does not allow email access. But the young gent who has worked there a good while (Miko? I've sent postcards through him there in the past) was very helpful. My boss emailed him the doc, he printed it, I signed it, and he scanned and emailed it back for me. Easy peasy and was done in 10 minutes! They really saved my ass on that one. At 2 in the afternoon I already had a 4 drink buzz, so it was nice to git 'er done and get back to the gambling and drinking. 

The only reason I won't give 4 stars this time is the internet access. I always have trouble there getting online, and I never have a prob at Luxor and other casino rooms.

Right smack dab in the middle of the strip with so many things around to do and see! The hotel is a little older but nothing that will alter your stay! Beautiful chandelier lobby's, spacious rooms, and one of my favorite casino layouts on the strip! a down side would be that they need to install a better air ventilation system in the casino area, you walk away smelling smoky and light headed.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a good time and not trying to break the bank! The room wasn't in brand new condition but I thought it was comfy and nice for the price paid. Room service was awesome!! We slept in one day and missed their services but when we left the room and took the ""do not disturb"" sign off of the door we arrived back to a perfectly clean and tucked room! I never expected them to come back once they had already passed! Bravo in my book because what a perk to be able to sleep in and still get your room cleaned! The staff was very helpful and friendly, and we even rented a car for about $150 (for one day), which is way cheaper than getting a taxi for travel. We stayed on floor 12, which I think the higher floors are newer? I'm not sure but that is how the elevator lobby looked for the higher levels. It was too cold for the pool to be open during my visit but the area looked very nice! Very convenient shops and food places available right on the lobby floor, and if you aren't interested in those choices there are plenty of choice right across the street! Although it is a far and long walk down the strip to get to the more fancy choices like the Venetian and Caesars Palace, it is a short walk to the luxury stores of Louis Vuitton and Prada.

You'd ask someone behind a desk a question and they'd just ignore you, as if pretending you weren't there.  Maybe an okay place to gamble at, but certainly not worth staying there.

My only complaint is right when you leave the tram and walk through from aria to Monte Carlo there's about half of a mile of walking and it smells like there is a pile of shit lurking right behind you and following you... Every Time I passed by there I wanted to vomit! It's horrendous! You can even smell this rotten spice of air refresher they tried to use to mask the smell of shit but it made it smell like shit spice. Please DO NOT pass there! This should be a health hazard period... If someone pooped there it should be found and removed IMMEDIATELY!,0,0,0

Paid $130\/night for the deluxe guestroom on the 15th floor which is not the cheapest price I saw compared to other hotels but I thought it was going to be a better quality hotel so I booked it.  I was wrong.  There is NO WIFI and we could hardly get any service on our phones in the room which made things very difficult as we were trying to research shows and restaurants to go to.  There is an ethernet cable that you can hook to your laptop which is an amenity included in your resort fee.  Wish I would have known that but I have never stayed in a hotel that doesn't offer free wifi so I didn't even think about it.  The hotel room was pretty dated.  I was kind of disappointed walking into the room after looking at the photos posted on travelocity's website.  At any time of day the check-in line was lengthy, even on Monday as we were checking out, the check-in line was just as long as it was on Saturday.  Some people were getting frustrated because they had 2 people working the check-ins.

Pros:

Location:  Not quite at the end of the strip.  I've stayed at the luxor which is at the very very end of the strip so it was nice not to have to walk as far.
Tram:  There is a tram that takes you to the Bellagio.  And it's FREE!  Just ask the staff about it or look for the signs.  There is also one across the street at the MGM.
Blue Man Group:  Affordable show to see and also convenient since it's located in the hotel.  We bought our tix from the ""Tix4tonight"" booth across the street for $68 each. 
*Tip for seeing shows:  Check living social or groupon for deals... saw some awesome deals on there after purchasing our blue man group tix.

Cons:
No Wifi
No Mini-Fridge
No dvd-player
Average looking lobby
No food or drinks allowed in pool (probably the same at all hotel pools) which means you have to wait in the huge line to order drinks
Smells like sewage outside

I think for the same price, I would have rather stayed at one of the more elaborately themed hotels. Quick check in and average room. The iHome is convenient for phone charging. The view from the room was horrible (the roof of the parking garage?! yuck). Old windows, the tinted tape was peeling off. Carpet stains and no fridge in the room (I guess that needed to be requested). There was a regular pool, lazy river, wave pool and sand volleyball. The wave pool was too calm and the lazy river as well. The water was extremely dirty and there was trash everywhere. By 5 pm, there was barely any sun in the area as the Mandarin Oriental and Aria blocked the afternoon light. It got cold really quickly. There was a house dj at the pool that made things more exciting. Tube rentals are $10, but there's no room to float. Back inside, there were bouncers pushing the lounge with open bar for ladies. The casino wasn't too packed, not even the Below 5* bar. The shopping area was dull, too. Housekeeping was nice about attending to our requests (such as more towels or coffee). The staff in general was friendly and we didn't have any hiccups. We were misinformed about the airport shuttle service, which was slightly frustrating. They should at least write the fees on the reservation website if they don't mention it on the phone\/during check out. The hotels fees for four drinks was more than the beers themselves, which was ridiculous. This place should NOT be called a resort.

I have stayed there many times, and I feel that I get a good value for my money. Rooms are clean, there are a lot of reasonably priced ""standard' food choices in their Food Court (i.e. Starbucks, Subway, McD's, mexican food, chinese food), as well as other restaurant choices. It is also a centrally-located hotel, which makes it good if you like to explore without walking for miles at a time. The other thing that's handy is a CVS store right at the front corner of the property, in case you forgot to bring anything, or if you want cheap snacks\/bottled water. 

My favorite part is the pool, though, which is why I usually choose the Monte Carlo. 
It is a good-sized area, but isn't overwhelmingly huge. It has a lazy river and a wave pool, plenty of chairs at almost any time of day (whether you want shade or no shade), and then a regular pool and hot tub. The customer service is very strong, too! I always rent a cabana or a daybed when I stay there, and the servers are very friendly, helpful and professional. 

I've only had one issue during the many times I've stayed there, and that was due to a drunk guest at the pool who was getting all up in my business. He threatened me and the Pool Manager was very helpful. He took care of the situation quickly and effectively, and was aplogogetic, even though it wasn't the hotel's fault.

We were so disappointed by the Monte Carlo.  We had mold in the bathtub and I called to let housekeeping know.  The answer was they could re-caulk, but we wouldn't be able to use it for a couple of days.  No offer of a different room, just we wouldn't be able to shower.  Needless to say, we turned that offer down.  We had just one washcloth and one soap in the room.  We called regarding that issue and they brought a huge bag of towels and toiletries to us.  Odd, but nice be able to pull out what we needed.   No coffee maker in the room and that was a bummer.

We headed out to take the free shuttle to Mandalay Bay to be able to use the pool since theirs was under construction.  We don't push and shove others to be first and held back.  We stood in the back of the shuttle and were informed they couldn't let anyone stand and we had to exit the bus and wait an hour for the next bus.  Wow.  An hour.  We'd already been waiting 15 minutes for the bus to arrive.  If it had been there earlier, people could have boarded as they arrived and we would easily have had a space.  So frustrating.

We did like the tram that could take us to the Bellagio.  That really helped with all the walking so much!  The resort fee should absolutely NOT be charged.

Let's get to the good stuff first: the staff I interacted with were amicable. The house-keeping staff were mindful of guests sleeping in (that would be me), the luggage check desk couldn't be sweeter, and the taxi concierge did his job efficiently when I needed to get to the airport. The guy who teaches the craps lesson is more engaging than than many of the shows on the Strip. Craps is a pretty intimidating game, this is no easy feat. 

MoCa has a token 24 hour cafe which I can totally recc if you're feeling breakfast foods. There are the obligatory omelets, but I'd steer you toward the carrot cake waffles and the dessert tray. Servers are not in a hurry: you've been warned.

Unless you join in the morning stampede to nab a poolside lounge chair you may end up having to shell out for a cabana. I circled the area three times before spying a spot and this was a weekday. All the pools were busy but navigable. Buy a tube at the nearby drugstore to avoid having to rent one from the resort (for the lazy river). You're in Vegas, which isn't know for it's peacefulness, so if you're staying here Thursday-Sunday a DJ starts spinning at noon. (I kinda liked it, even though it's all top 40s. I'd prefer that over listening to guests plan their nightclub itineraries while guzzling margaritas.)

Bad stuff: Gym use is an additional fee per day. Want to use wi-fi or the business center's computer? Expect to fork over some bones for that as well. The room was adequate but my comforter had several small tears in it. No directory of services in our room, we had to call front desk for every query. I avoided the food court but it would make for easy eating if you have a hungry mob of kids in tow.

When we arrived, we were told by a very nice, very pregnant woman that we had been given an upgrade.  Out of curiousity, we asked why and she said that sometimes it just happens.  We figured it can't be a bad thing and at least we'll get a good view or something.  Turns out, they gave us the freakin Spa Suite.

The room had a GIANT tub near the window that would make Joe Francis whip out the camera faster than a hooker drops to her knees.  There was also a California King bed with an oversized comforter, a sofa, tv, coffee table, separate shower and toilet and a wet bar.  There were power blackout blinds you could close from the bed area or the tub area and they gave you plenty of bubble bath for your sudsy pleasure.

Our shower also didn't drain properly, and the shower curtain was stained.  After our complaints, the hotel did accommodate us and moved us up to the 32nd floor, which offered much nice amenities.  They usually charge more for those rooms, but honestly all the rooms should look like that.  They are nice, but basically what you would find in any other newer hotel.  The lounge area and all of its offerings was excellent, and would probably be worth the price to stay up there.  

Security was rude to my husband, who didn't feel well and got up in the middle of the night to walk around for a bit.  He wasn't drunk or making any noise whatsoever.  They asked to see his room key to make sure he was staying on the 32nd floor.  THE ROOM KEYS FOR THE 32nd FLOOR LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE KEYS FOR THE OTHER FLOORS, so I don't know what he was trying to accomplish by demanding to see the key.  The security manager or security office didn't seem to care about this incident.  No hotel should be hiring rude employees.  Hotels are a service business and no customer deserves anything less than courteous treatment, regardless of the situation.  If employees can't learn to keep a professional demeanor, they shouldn't be working in a hotel, period.

Parking is convenient to the lobby, casino is nice (although I don't know how so many people still smoke, it's disgusting to have to smell their cigarette smoke).  Overall the common areas are nice but I would never choose to return to stay in the regular hotel rooms.  The buffet was excellent.",1,0,0

We stayed 10\/5-10\/8 and everything was pretty great. We arrived at the hotel around 930 am so there wasn't much of a line for check in. We took our chances and asked if there was a room available. There wasn't, and we were informed that we would get a text when a room became available. That text came around 2:30pm. The bellboy held our bags while we drove down to china town. When we got back to the hotel we went up to room 15-117. The room is pretty standard. No fridge, no coffee maker but that didn't bother us. Who needs a coffee maker with such a delicious coffee place down stairs?

Monte Carlo took such great care of us. From comping us dinner and resort fees to cocktail waitresses always being present. 

The only reason this isn't a a 4 star review is because 2 out of the 3 mornings we were woken up by women speaking Spanish next door at 8 am. The first morning we thought they were guests but after leaving our room discovered that it had been house keeping the whole time. It's so rude!!",3,0,0

The food was in fact, extremely horrible. My sister (Jessica O.) also reviewed this place, and she hit the nail right on the head. Everything was hot and greasy, and generally of a very poor quality. This place even found a way to F up nachos. I don't know how, but they did it. 

The drinks were outta this world, lucky for us because we needed to spend $110 bucks a piece on them.

The casino is dark and uninteresting and there's not much else to entice visitors.  While they do have a number of restaurants, none of them have ever appealed to me.  The biggest positives of this place are its location, bridging the south and center portions of the Strip, and the fact that the new, free monorail that serves Bellagio, City Center, and Aria, also stops here.  When we needed to cut back on the walking due to a health emergency, we used the monorail down to Monte Carlo to make it easier to get to NYNY and the tram to Mandalay Bay.

The dishes have always been cooked to perfection (except for the ONE time my hash browns were a little over-done, but it's cool). Other than that, nothing compares to their cafe for the price.

Their customer service has always been outstanding. The staff is always pleasant and accommodating. IF something does go wrong, they always do their best to fix it.

For those of you who enjoy gambling like myself, the MC is great. I'm a slotty gal so can't say much for the tables, but they have machines that range from $.05 to $5. Can't say the same for Aria next door. $10 video poker?! I ran right back to MC.

The rooms I have stayed in were always clean. I also tip the maids regardless if they come into my room during my stay. If everyone at least left them a few bucks to show appreciation, it'd go a long way. Oh yeah, tip the cocktail waitresses too. $1 a drink is my rule. It's just a classy thing to do.

The beds were obviously already used a lot, however they were comfy enough.  Pillows were very big and fluffy, nice for leaning on, but literally a pain in the neck to sleep on.  I had to take two Tylenol and four ibuprofen for a week after leaving Vegas.  

The casino wasn't too bad, I didn't mind it at all.  We actually enjoyed the Go Go Girls dancing on a short runway.   I even appreciated the non-smoking FLOORS.  Wish all of Vegas could be non-smoking indoors like California.  A girl\/mother can wish.

Went for a friend's bday and the only thing we had on the agenda was to sit by the pool and go to the hottest clubs. 

We checked in at about 1pm Friday since our room was ready. We had a room with two queen beds. The room was clean and service was great. I ordered towels and extra cups and they came right away. We knew we wouldn't be staying in our hotel for much of the day except to sleep, so why pay for a room that wouldn't be utilized? Late check out is at Noon. We left on Sunday. 

Pool: there is a lazy river, wave pool, and regular pool. I don't think this is a kid friendly hotel. The pool was conveniently located a couple of feet from the elevator which meant we didn't have to walk that far. It was HOT!  There were more 21yo and up adults drinking and smoking, than families. 

Food court: I love how convenient this hotel is. Once you got out of the elevator it was only a couple feet away from the food court, which included MC Donald's, Subway, Sbarro, Hagen Daz, etc. Sit down dining and buffets were also close together.

The rooms do not have a closet, rather they have an armoire type piece of furniture to put things in. 

The carpet is dirty, old, and in many spots wrinkled (where it appears that the carpet has either flooded or gotten wet). 

The shower and sink drain very very slowly. The sink filled when washing hands\/brushing teeth and water remained for a long time afterward. 

The entire pool is torn down right now and has been for some time; there is no mention of this on the website. There is major construction going on; construction is very loud and begins early in the morning.

About customer service.

No apology for our long wait, or for being given the wrong info. We were dismissed.

These places have insurance, right? The security officer who came to deal with the issue, was rude, dismissive, and had no information about the process of filing a claim.

After some back and forth with a manager I was offered a food and beverage credit and to have the resort fees waived to make up for it - neither of which would help me get my shoe fixed, but I elected to take it because they implied the alternative would probably end up being no compensation at all. 

Using the food and beverage credit was its own hassle. There was a tiny list of places we could use it, and they were all closed by midnight. Since we were given the credit the night before we left, we had to order a massive breakfast...and dinner for later, and snacks...at the cafe the next morning before we checked out of the hotel so we wouldn't lose the credit. 

The icing on the cake was that when we went to check out, they had not waived the resort fees - in fact, they had charged us twice for them. My friend had to spend half an hour working it all out with a manager while we just sat around. We were offered a 15% discount on future stays for the multiple inconveniences, but obviously we will not be staying here again.

All that being said, we did have a few good moments - Preston at the front desk gave us some great suggestions for food and entertainment, so props to him. The staff at the cafe (particularly our waitress Jennifer) were fantastic dealing with our last minute flurry of orders trying to spend the food and beverage credit. And the bell desk very kindly let us leave our bags of extra food with our luggage so we wouldn't have to cart them around all morning, even though it was against their policy. Those good moments bought the hotel an extra star.",0,0,0

Review #14:
a solid middle-range casino on a prime piece of real estate; wedged between Aria\/City Center and the currently-in-building-process Las Vegas Arena and The Park areas; they have really upgraded this place, so while not all that big, it is a worthy spot, especially for mid-scale dining options; many of these are on the now-completed Strip-front walkway area; I challenge you to find a better deal for Strip-front dining than the inexpensive & super-tasty 800 Degrees (Neapolitan pizza); there is a small, but nice, shopping corridor with the best feature being The Pub (read on); best craft beer bet = by far, it's The Pub, which has a genuinely excellent beer list both on tap & in bottles; nice big space too, although I could do without the horrid dueling pianos bad-80's music when I was there; overall, the Monte Carlo rates at 3.5 stars, but I will bump them up due to The Pub and the Strip-front dining spots (BTW, the corridor walkway from the casino to Diablo's Cantina is pretty cool).",1,0,1

Pros-

Inexpensive

Cons-
Small Rooms with PAPER THIN walls

No fridge or microwave in room

No bathrobe

No real theme to hotel, nothing that makes it fun or unique

We were in Vegas for a family reunion and the fam wanted to see Blue Man Group. When I looked up Monte Carlo on Orbitz and some of the other travel sites, it showed 4 stars. My BAD for not checking Yelp first!

We traditionally do not stay in less than 4 stars, especially since this was a family reunion and I wanted it to be nice. I thought ""why not stay at Monte Carlo so we can watch the show and not jump from hotel to hotel?"". WORST. MISTAKE. EVER. I was so embarrassed. :( It's an MGM resort but definitely not MGM standards.

We checked in at 2am and were greeted by an agent who couldn't crack a smile if we paid her. Then, we were put in a room that had a broken fire alarm, reeked of plastic, and looked like a Clarion hotel. At 2am, we had to switch rooms only to find issues with the room again. Missing stuff and remotes not working, etc. We were so exhausted it wasn't worth it.

I checked with the family on the other rooms: there were paintings missing leaving a barren room with holes in the walls and the inside toilet paint had worn off. It was so embarrassing that I had booked this hotel for family.

The only good thing: it was fairly clean.

We started off with a long line at check in. This was understandable given that it's a large hotel resort and it was the weekend. Once I reached the counter, the associate provided me with a free buffet for two when I inquired about upgrades available. This was essentially the only high point of my entire stay here.

We arrive in the room and it was obvious this is one of the older hotels on the strip. The carpets had old faded stains, room was slightly musty, and there was green\/blue mildew in the shower head. Although all of this is bad, it's not bad enough in my book to warrant a one star review. Here's the kicker that drove them down to the lowest rating possible - moths.

I had five moths coming out of the ventilation system over the course of a single night. I killed three and cleaned up the mess but after I had to kill the fourth and fifth one, I just left their dead bodies on the walls and called down to the front desk for a different room. I was initially met with ""we're fully booked tonight"" and it wasn't until I insisted on getting out of this room that they moved us. They did not seem taken aback from moths in the vents as it sounds like it's a regular occurrence - ""People leave the windows open and that's how they get into the rooms and vents. Nothing we can do about it."" Their only compensation for my disgusting inconvenience was to take off one out of two nights' resort fees.

We got an upgrade to a room on a higher floor, the bed was great, the pillows were comfy, and, despite who we recognized to be noisy neighbors, were unheard of all night. GREAT!

I reserved pool chairs through their company loungereserve.com to prevent the stress that comes along with forcing yourself to wake up early to get a coveted seat by the pool. When we went to claim our reservation our first day there, we were seated right by the DJ booth and were told that the DJ would be starting at 12p. Holy hell! Being seating by the DJ booth was not something I agreed to when I reserved my seats! But, this is where the $20 seat reservation area is. It seems like they should tell you this before you book. So, I immediately went to cancel my reservation for the next day and was told I had to do it through the website where I booked it -- loungereserve.com. I did this as soon as it was possible and explained the situation, noting that it would take 24 hours for someone to get back to me. Fast forward 1 follow up email and 7 DAYS LATER -- they finally responded saying cancellations must be made 48 hours in advance. That was it. So, I wrote back and explained the situation AGAIN and they said that it was the resorts policy and there was nothing they could do. So, Monte Carlo pool staff threw me to them and loungereserve.com threw me back to Monte Carlo. What the hell?? Haven't heard anything back from them since responding that there had to be something they could do. 
Next step is to contact Monte Carlo directly and pray.

The people in the room next to us smoked pot the whole time, causing the odor to leak under our adjoining door and stink up our room.  But my ingenious hubby stuffed a towel under the door.  Problem solved.

Here's where we were totally impressed: Customer Service, Location, and Food Court.  We stayed for 7 days and had dealings with extremely professional and helpful staff. They happily printed off our boarding passes for the flight home; thus avoiding the $1 per minute computer fee's for everyone else. Their location is mid-strip which is perfect.  It's an easy walk to either end of the strip.  Not sure if this matters to most people, but I hate dragging my luggage through the casino floor after I check into a hotel.  This place has a great layout.  The taxi drops you off at the door nearest the lobby, and the hotel elevators are right next to that; thereby avoiding that embarrassing walk through the casino area with luggage.   Lastly, they had a nice food court which was perfect when you're looking for something small to tide you over.  They had a ton of options to choose from, and considering it was in Vegas I guess the prices weren't so bad.

This was my third time in Vegas, but the first time in this hotel. We walked up to the check-in and we mentioned that it was my birthday and they upgraded us to a high floor strip-view room which honestly was a great way to start off the trip. I immediately dropped off my bags and ran to the window to watch the strip\/people. You can see some pretty interesting bits going on if you pay attention close enough downstairs.

That was the first great thing that happened. The second thing which was cool was the room credit. We booked this room specifically for the birthday promo on their website which included 2-for-1 drinks at Big Chill and free select domestic beer at The Pub. They ended up not having any of the coupons for Big Chill prepared so they comped us $50 in dining credit for wherever we decided to go in the hotel. Cool, thanks! We enjoyed quite a few drinks at the bar during happy hour, and didn't have to worry about the cost of drinks on my birthday. Can't complain.

The BMG, which I didn't get to see, looked pretty interesting but I've heard the shows were just okay. The pricing was about 40% off for MC hotel guests if you wanted to go. I didn't make it this time, but maybe next time I'll try and catch their show. They have a nightly procession through the lobby at 6:15 which showcases some of their contraptions: a drum that moves itself and a lot of bright lights and sounds. I heard the show was just okay but I'll never know for sure. 

The casino was considerably smaller compared to the Aria, MGM Grand, etc. There also isn't a lot of waitresses walking around taking drink orders which is why I spent most of time at Aria. I sat at their computer roulette tables and got about 4-5 drinks during the hour - hour and a half. I was lucky if I got ONE at the MC. 

Their food court has a Mickey D's (what I call the McDonald's), Sbarro, Subway, Original Chicken Tenders, and Nathan's (I think). The line was super long for MCD's which I got one night when it was late and I didn't feel like walking the strip looking for food and I've had some....a lot of drinks. 

You can take the tram to Aria, Bellagio, Crystals, and I also think Cosmopolitan. I used this quite often to go around to all the hotels and take some shortcuts. 

Okay so in conclusion to my review I will say this and then press the ""post"" button and hope I made no spelling errors. The hotel was in a nice location, easy access to other hotels, The Pub was a quick happy hour stop, and the beds were comfortable enough for me. I loved the view I got but if I had not gotten the strip view it probably would have sucked, but I got what I paid for. The hotel seems a bit run down as far as decor goes, there's a lot of faded-ish looking gold and brown tones and the walls are thin. I could hear what my neighbors were listening to at all hours. The price was good for what we got: location, location, location. 

P.S. I really hope they get free wi-fi past the first two floors for their guests.",4,1,3

The rooms reminded me of a mediocre Double Tree in Iowa City, but I didn't spend that much time there so it was ok. The casino was never very filled, which might be good for some, but I need some interaction. 

Fortunately I found some nice folks at the Blackjack tables, unfortunately they didn't know what they were doing (this happened a few times.) If you don't play blackjack, then having bad people at your table actually does effect the game and is a bad thing. The waitresses were old (sorry) and slow with the boos.

The pools were crowded, but much more geared towards kids. I ordered a drink and it was $10 for a small. It did come from a very attractive waitress, so I couldn't complain that much...now if we could only get them at the tables...

We ate at the buffet for breakfast one morning and it was your standard buffet. We also ate at the cafe type thing... I can't give that a glowing review as we had terrible service...there were four other tables yet it still took us an hour to get our food.

Value: I can't complain too much as I didn't pay too much (I think it was like $60 a night.) But you can find better prices at the same quality hotel...I think I would go with Luxor or Bill's next time.

Amenity-wise there are a row of shops and a food court, both of which were a tad on the small side and the casino floor itself felt a little limited, but proximity-wise you are close to everything so its easy to hop around to the hotel of your choice.

Overall, had a good stay and would probably stay here again.",3,1,1

Check-in staff was friendly and happily accommodated our floor preference. However, the room itself was a bitter disappointment. The bathroom was NOT clean. GREEN calcium stains on the shower head and fixtures as well as mold stains around the tub seals. GROSS.
Beds looked clean, but did not smell clean. Definitely some residual perfume left over from the previous guests.

To top it all off, the Air Conditioning did not work properly. Woke up at 2 AM to find the temperature had climbed to almost 80 degrees!

My sister and I only stayed for one night and I'm the morning as we were trying to sleep before our drive back to la we began to hear loud hammering and drilling in the next room. At check out, the front desk guy apologized saying he was not sure why the maintenance people were doing that. He offered to refund the resort fee. I checked my account yesterday and apparently he did not refund the resort fee. I called and the representative on the phone stated that she checked with the front desk and that while there were notes, that they forgot to proceed with the refund process and it would take an additional 5 business days.

Found a room here for a decent price and the reviews were good so I went for it. We only used it as a base to explore the city, and it worked well. Parking was easy to find and spots were plentiful. We never used valet, only self park. Check-in took about 5 minutes waiting in line, not a big deal. Got room keys and found the elevator to our floor. The room was nice, clean, and had no smoke smell. We had a view on the pool and parking garage. One thing noticeable is that there was no WIFI, only an ethernet cable to use. That was annoying. The only other complaint I have is the shower leaked all over the floor. No matter how you did the shower curtain, it still soaked the floor. Beds were comfy with a nice duvet. The hotel was also quiet. Walking through the casino, there are a few nice places to eat, as well as a food court that's open 24\/7. The hotel is right across the street, and maybe a 10 minute walk from the Monorail station at MGM. One thing to be aware of is the outside pool and hot tub close in the winter. I was surprised it wasn't open and heated. Also, though it's not the hotels fault, AT&T seemed to be in a virtual dead zone around this hotel. Full bars and no connection.

The best price for hotel and location was The Monte Carlo. We stayed 2 nights on a weekend and it was $236 including tax and resort fees. I think it was around $90 per night before fees etc.

We found a parking spot in the small lot right outside of the lobby. They have a parking structure too but definitely check the small one first! We were advised to move it to the structure but it was free parking anyway and we assumed right that no one would check. 

On check in, we were offered a high floor with a strip view .. AWESOME! And it got better fast. We were told we had $75 to spend on food\/drink at 'THE PUB', the bar in the Monte Carlo. We ate there twice, for free! Can't beat that price. 

Okay, the room. Definitely not as nice as newer hotels, but it wasn't not nice. The only major problem - no fridge in the room. Something which is pretty standard i feel like? 

Also, we put the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door and housekeeping still knocked numerous times. WHY DO THEY DO THIS IN EVERY HOTEL?. Seriously? It's Vegas, the city that never sleeps. I'm not in bed at a reasonable hour, so don't disturb me early morning - ESPECIALLY when the SIGN is on the door! 

Oh and the water pressure in the shower was LAME. Why is it so hard to find a nice shower.

Tip- pay the extra few bucks for a room upgrade, the higher floors are in much better shape than the lower ones. Lower ones would get 1 1\/2 stars from me- pretty bad.

Beds are comfortable, and the rooms are decent sized. They now give you two in room complimentary coffees (Keurig, not too bad)  to save you the hike down to the Starbucks at the food court. The CVS next door sells Keurig pods,  so you can stock up, if you are a heavy coffee drinker like myself.

Alarm clocks with phone docking station.

The resort fee (and extra $20 on top of the room rate) includes the coffee, WIRED in room internet, newspaper, and gym usage.

Pool is very good, but they have added too many cabanas, and now seating is pretty difficult, unless you show up around opening time. Pool closes at 7. They sell and rent floats for the lazy river ($10-20). Beers are about $8. DJ on the weekends.

Valets do a good job, so do the bellhops,  and the maids tend to do a much better job on the higher floors...a decent tip will certainly help in all these areas, and  is much appreciated.  Front desk service is good.

Skip the Buffet- go to Aria, Bellagio or Wynn. All good bets. The room service is fairly reasonable for Vegas.

All in all, you can certainly do worse, and the cheap rates and good pool keep me coming back. if you don't care about the pool however, I would keep looking. You can stay at a much nicer place for another $50 or so a night.",3,1,2

I availed of their Yusho Restaurant promotion which gives you $50 credit to the restaurant. I received my Hotel Bill and the discount was not taken out.  I am also an M life member but booking it as a member was more expensive. So I took out a star for each of these reasons.

When we arrived on Thursday night we waited in line for about 10 minutes to check in. The woman that checked us in was super friendly and gave us an upgrade room facing the pool, since there were no more queen non-smoking rooms available. Thumbs up for her!

We went up to our room, primped and planned to use the 2 for 1 appetizer and free champagne that came with the package, but by the time we got down to the café around 10:15, it was closed (What closes at 10PM in Vegas???)

The next day we planned on hanging out by the pool for the whole day floating on the lazy river. We arrived at the pool early and found some seats. By 11:00AM on Friday morning the pool was already really crowded. I recommend arriving early if you want a beach chair. Part of our summer escape package included 2 for 1 raft rentals. When we went up to the rental counter, the guy said they don't do paid rentals anymore and that we needed to buy a raft for $50 we'd get a rental for free. (WHAT? I PAID EXTRA MONEY FOR THIS DEAL AND NOW YOU WANT ME TO PAY ANOTHER $50 FOR A CHEAP RAFT AND RENTAL? THIS IS BAIT AND SWITCH PEOPLE!!!)

The room was spacious enough and though not completely soundproof, we were fairly certain that our neighbors couldn't hear our baby crying.  I would only stay here again if it was significantly less expensive than its neighbors.

Monte Carlo has no nightlife (read no night club) and no attractions.  The pool area has a ""lazy river"" you can float in.  The arcade is beyond small and boring.

Room service has a nice selection.  The cleaning staff is very good, but uses way too much lemon-scented aerosol air freshener.  You have to pay for the gym.  And worse, you have to pay $11 per day per laptop for an internet connection.

My parents had asked us to come out and offered to pay for our room. We're MLife members so I checked to see if we had any offers, didn't want them to pay an outrageous amount so I decided to go with The Monte Carlo's offer. It was $85, then with taxes and the resort fee it was $123 and some change. We had never stayed here before so we figured why not.

Check in was just a little bit of a hiccup. My parents had come the following day to pay for the room and apparently asked the lady who helped them if there would be any trouble when we arrived and checked in, if they weren't with us. She told them the room was all paid up and there should be no problems. Well there was, we were asked to show the credit card that was used to pay the balance. Well we obviously didn't have it and thankfully one of my parents were with us when we checked in.

The lady who checked us in wasn't very polite about the whole ordeal, which was irritating. I understand they have a policy and there was a mix up when they asked the original lady they dealt with but you're in customer service. Being short and impolite isn't the way to go and reflects badly on your resort.

After that we had no problems. Every other employee we encountered was polite and helpful. Room was average but clean and bed was comfortable.

I can't put together a coherent review which would capture the ""run! don't walk!"" for anyone considering booking a reservation here.  The first assault is olfactory.  The MC ""perfumes"" their common areas and casino with something best described as Ozium and urinal cake at the Greyhound bus terminal.  What? Why?!?

The ""decor = tired""?  OMFG, my frat house last century was in better shape than this tijuana brothel.  Just pathetic.  We moved from 8th, to 9th and then 24th floor in sequence, a futile ""Escape from Craptastica!"".  Each floor has less busted stuff, but in the end, nothing even reach Howard Johnson status.

The vaunted pool?  I would rather go to Rosarita Beach and wallow in a Papas & Beer cesspool of Nortenos Spring Break urine.  That almost captures it, I really felt as if I was in some Cancun sh1thole with a bunch of low-rent state school college kids on Spring Break.

The Monte Carlo never pretended to be the Venetian, or Mandelay Bay, or Bellagio back in the day.  But a value proposition it is no more.  It's a tired old rag of a hotel with no pretense that they give a damn about anything, so there you are.

The workout area and spa are definitely acceptable, I will give a gentlemen's B+ on this feature only.  Woe betide anyone who isn't physically off spa premises at 7:01P as you'll get the bum's rush at closing time.  But if you're a saavy consumer of value, $10 for the spa is a great deal.

Not to mention the not-so-friendly staff who took all of my gambling money.  Okay, I can't exactly blame them for my losses (which I will never gamble here ever again), but the service definitely did not make it any better.  From the point I checked in to the point I checked out, I think there was only one staff member who was actually friendly out of the 298437592 others that worked there.  

As for the rooms, I got a deluxe room but after staying in this very dimly lit room with cheap carpet and just an icky ambiance about it, I had no choice but to upgrade ourselves to a spa suite, just because I couldn't stand it.  I admit, the suites are the only good thing that the hotel has going for it.  The jacuzzi was nice and the suite itself was not bad but that still does not change my opinion of this place.

Customer service replied "" we do not waive resort fees until the property is booked."" We were denied talking or a call back from a supervisor is this ""resort"" thinking. Why would we book a room if we had a problem with the amenities and I do not believe a pool relates to a resort and if we got there they did not waive and we are stuck with it. Who wants to walk a mile to a neighbor property to use ""their"" pool. We have stayed at 5 star resorts ""industry rated"" and they truly are. When is it that consumers do not disagree with a fee that use to be considered an amenity and treated like crap. Now Super 8 charges resort fees. Monte Carlo is working their way towards ""Motel 6"" status. Charge what you have to charge but do not disguise it as a resort fee when you want to make more on the room and when does a pool and wifi make you a resort.  You are not even offered free entry to use the spa facility which would be a resort item. Do they offer combs, blow dryers, brushes, sandals, robes etc to make it a true resort or is it just super greedy companies. Could you call a bellman to bring you a bucket of ice or do you get to do it yourself.",1,0,0

If the hotel was in any other city in America, you'd probably think it was fantastic, but for Vegas it leaves a lot to be desired. Nothing terrible here and I would probably stay again if the price were right, but they just don't pay close attention to the details.

The tv and cable package are bad. No wireless internet (even though you have to pay a resort fee). The shower is older and not that great. The hallways are often cluttered and dirty. Elevator buttons sometimes don't work. Stuff that really annoys you.

That being said, they did provide us with a crib and refridgerator at no charge. The casino is nice and it's in a great location. The all day buffett was decent and relaticely inexpensive. All in all, it's an ok place if the price is right.",0,0,0

We asked for a room with a view of the strip. The view we got from the 8th floor was of the recycling bins which they empty bottles in even after midnight which is not a very quiet experience. A few things did stand out. The valets all of them were really friendly and pleasant. Made sure always we were in the right place or if we needed a cab. The room attendants seemed like they left our room nice and clean with fresh towels.  I never saw one to ask for my bed to be untucked. Food court pretty good. Shops decent selection. Another thing was when we asked about getting a comp at the Mlife desk she said I could get a Starbucks with it. When I went to Starbucks it was actually for $25 in coffee!! I know Starbucks is expensive but I had to use it all or lose the balance which was not explained to me at the desk which would of been nice.

Before booking a hotel in vegas, we did a lot of searching and wanted to find a hotel that was reasonably priced with a good pool. We ended up choosing Monte Carlo.. and after this weekend I wish we would have decided on another hotel. 

We arrived late Thursday night (close to midnight) and the line to check in was about an hour wait. They only had two people working!! Finally someone was smart enough to request backup and once a few other employees came to help the line moved much quicker. Once we arrived at the front desk, we were greeted by an extremely rude male employee. He acted if we had just ruined his evening by walking into his place of business! As we were checking in, he informed us that only one room would have a king (which we both requested) and the other would have a queen. Then he said they would be smoking (we requested non-smoking). We asked if there was anything he could do to make changes because we would be extremely unhappy with those accommodations. He said there was nothing he could do and then gave us a figure as to how much it would cost if we wanted to cancel our reservation. At this point I asked to speak to the manager.

Once the manager arrived he was extremely polite and apologetic for his employee (must happen often!). He gave both rooms a $50.00 credit to a variety of restaurants in the hotel. He found two non-smoking room, one with a king and one with two queens, which at this point was fine with us because we wanted to be done with this process already! 

The hotel was extremely out-dated and we had a worker come up UNANNOUNCED to fix something in the bathroom. My boyfriend stayed at Harrah's for a fraction of the price the last time he was in Vegas and he said the rooms looked exactly the same! 

We figured the pool would be the saving grace for the hotel... but sadly we were mistaken. Unless you are traveling with children - this pool is not for you! There were kids everywhere!! Not that I can't stand children (I've been a nanny for 6 years) but when I want to take a dip in the pool, cruise down the lazy river, dance in the wave pool with the DJ playing music, or lay out.. I'd prefer not to hear screaming kids or be splashed like crazy! 

And to top off this awful experience, my credit card has been charged an extra $150 on top of what the total charges for our stay were. I called the front desk (which took over 20 minutes waiting on hold to finally get a live person) and they said that its just an insurance charge that will be removed once the total room charge has gone through on the account - WRONG! At this moment my card has approved, and been charged both the total charge for the weekend AND the $150 ""insurance"". I am calling back today to get this sorted. 

The only thing this place has going for it is the location on the strip 

OVERALL : Monte Carlo = Monte Crapo!!",1,0,1

The Pros:
-Lazy river! :) wave pool!

The Cons:
-ice vending machine on our floor was not working 
-shower head was leaky
-bathroom smelled like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room (bad vent?)
-front desk workers contradicted one another and give me different answers when i asked them about the complimentary buffet passes (if you don't know the answer, please ask your supervisor!)
-mandatory resort fee

The $20 resort fee per day also had a 12% tax on it. During check in we tried to get them to waive the fee since we never use the amenities the resort fee is supposed to cover (i.e., coffee and water bottle in the room, printing service, newspaper, etc).  however, their policy is that the fee is mandatory for everyone.

Also, when we booked our room, it came with 2 complimentary buffets. I was very annoyed that when I asked 3 different people from the front desk how to use the complimentary buffets (like, is it for breakfast? lunch? Is there a max value to it?) they each gave me a different answer. 

Overall, 2.5 but since my previous stays here were not as terrible, I'll round up to 3 stars",1,0,0

When you walk in from the strip, the Hit Bar is just past the steakhouse on the right.

The best thing about this bar is that it is NOT focused on tourism or video poker or anything other than drinks.  They take classic drinks from around the most popular hotel bars in the USA and replicate them!  They present all of them in a cool faux leather bound menu...and fix very traditional and proper concoctions.

The bartenders are real, no sloppy drinks here.  If you want a Bud Light or a shot or a crappy drink, just go somewhere else.  If you're looking to get your money's worth for a superior blended beverage, then indulge and enjoy.  One of the best ""secret"" finds on the strip!!

Wouldn't even give them one star if I had a choice.

Don't bother wasting your time  money to stay at this 4 star hotel that is dirty, old and that offers low quality service. 

I am very disappointed and disgusted with my experience at Monte Carlo hotel this past weekend.

The room we were given  had a bad smell, like the room hasn't been used in months, and you can smell it as soon we you walk in. I called the front desk, who assured me that the room has been 'used' recently and that they will send up air freshener for the smell. 8 hours later I return to the room and no air freshener and it still smelled. I was going to take a shower before heading out to dinner when I saw that our shower was completely covered in mold!!! 

Take a good look at the picture and tell me if this looks like a room that has been used recently?!! This is a 4 STAR HOTEL folks! 

I went to the front desk immediately to complain and was so disappointed by the 'service' of an employee Juanita. Her response to my complaint after she 'talked to her manager'  was 'we don't have any rooms available but you can upgrade for $20) I never asked for an upgrade to begin with and if there aren't any rooms available the LEAST they can do for the inconvenience is to change us rooms of NO CHARGE!!! 

The manager (I don't remember his name but saw Los Angeles, Ca on his name tag) who didn't bother to apologize didn't want to change us rooms. After arguing,  a vacant room 'magically' appeared when 2 seconds ago Juanita said there weren't any. I've worked in customer service and the golden rule is 'The customer is always right' and apparently the employees need to be retrained because they don't know a thing about working in customer service. 

To top it off, I randomly ran into a friend who was also staying at the hotel and I was telling her about our horrible room experience and she told me that she got upgraded for free without even requesting it at check in. To me, this sounds like racial profiling. She is white and I am Asian. As soon as I walked up to the front desk, it was clear that Juanita just saw me as an Asian person that wanted a free upgrade, which is clearly not the case. I don't think expecting a clean shower without mold at a 4 star hotel is too much to ask for. 

The shower in our 'new' room 3116, had a clogged drain and the water took forever to go down. I wasn't going to even waste my time asking for another room change. 

After this experience, Monte Carlo doesn't even deserve 1 star.",6,1,1

We arrived into town around 1:00 and called to see if we could check in early (check in time was 3:00). We were told it would cost an extra $20. Let the nickel-and-diming begin. We opted not to check in early and when we finally did make it to our room we were unimpressed. It was no better than any low-end hotel room. The fixtures in the bath tub were loose and the cold water dripped after turning the faucet off. The attendant handed us a pamphlet at check in listing the amenities at the hotel. We were excited that Keurig coffee makers were included in the room as part of the resort fee (we had seen this listed elsewhere as well). We did not find a Keurig in the room, but a cheap coffee maker with cheap coffee. We called the front desk to find out why our room did not have a Keurig, and were told they didn't have them any more. After expressing displeasure at the false advertising, they agreed to refund one night's resort fee. We wouldn't be using any of the other amenities. Also, the pool looked awesome but was closed for the season. The temps were in the mid-70s and pools at other hotels were open. Another disappointment. 

When I tried to turn on the television with the remote, nothing happened. I found that the TV was unplugged, but plugging it back in did not help matters, although I was able to turn it on with the buttons on the TV itself. The front desk sent someone up with a new remote, but that one didn't work either. They promised to send up a technician ""right away"", which didn't happen. A little while later someone called the room to find out if the television had been fixed, and they also promised to send someone ""right away."" Hours later, the TV did get fixed while we were away from the room. Also, when I tried to plug in two electronic devices, one of the outlets would not accept the plug. No idea what that was about.

Now for the positives. They had great customer services. Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful. It's in a good location with convenient dining options. Blue Man Group promotions are everywhere, and you're confronted with loud advertisements every time you enter the elevator. They do have a fun parade every evening that storms through the casino. The rooms were acceptably clean and the beds were comfortable. We stayed here because the price was right, but next time I'd choose a different hotel.",0,0,0

Typically I'd stay at the Wynn or Aria but I was traveling with a friend who was trying to stay on a limited budget so we opted for cheaper options and came across a really good deal at the Monte Carlo. I was pleasantly surprised with my experience. While the Monte Carlo is outdated and largely lacks the luxury of hotels like the Wynn or Aria, it was great considering it only cost about a third of any of those hotels. My room was very clean, the staff was as friendly and helpful as can be, and the location is pretty good. I didn't eat at any of the restaurants as none were particularly appealing, and that's probably the biggest drawback. On the plus side, they have Sambalatte Torrefazione which quite easily makes the best coffee anywhere on the Strip. The casino is pretty low key and laid back too, which I did appreciate.

Although the staff was very polite and accommodating, the actual venue is what I wasn't happy about. The outside is beautiful of course due to the series of restaurants surrounding the hotel and the new T-Mobile Arena. The casino floor is also nice  although it does appear to be a little outdated. The rooms are a different story. They are outdated, old, stuffy and flawed. Furniture is vintage and by vintage I mean chipped and scratched, the beds are hard and I had a king size bed with little bed coverings and 3 standard pillows, not very inviting for sleeping. The bathroom tub was stained and the toilet is so loud when flushed you could probably hear it outside and down the hall. I ordered room service and the ""California"" omelet I ordered was horrible. Soggy eggwhites with absolutely no flavor and cost me about $30 bucks. Very disappointing, especially when you're starving and too tired to venture out of the room to get a decent meal on the casino floor.

Stayed here with my 6 year old son Tue-Fri in mid Nov 2014. 

Overall, I do not regret the price I paid  for the hotel - $200 for 3 nights.  The best part about this hotel is its convenient location and a tram to City Center and Belagio.  It is also close to New York New York, MGM Grand, City Center, and M&M Store.

We came to LV to see shows.  Blue Man was one of them, and it is at Monte Carlo.  We both liked the show.  In fact, my son wanted to see it again, which we did.

Check in was quick on Tuesday, and the staff was friendly and polite.  The room seemed clean and did not have any weird smells.  Towels and linens were clean and beds were comfortable.  AC worked well and was reasonably quiet.  However, all this is expected, so it's not like I would award extra points for any of this.

I thought that there was a mismatch between the beautiful external appearance of the hotel and a pretty nice looking casino and an average tired-looking hotel room.  You can almost immediately tell that the hotel is older and that the attention to detail is lacking.  

* There was some cable coming out of the wall that had a cut end.  There was another cable that was stapled along the bottom of the wall, but it was not straight, and a considerable portion in the middle was not stapled so a slack was just lying on the floor.

* The desk had a hole drilled through it.  It probably had something attached to it, which since has been removed, but no one bothered repairing the hole or putting a plug to at least cover it.

* The bathroom had all traditional gold color fixtures except for the shower valve which was brushed nickel, and a modern square chrome shower head with four square holes from which water was shooting out in an unpleasant pattern.

* The free TV reception was horrible - grainy with washed out colors, like if they were using a rabbit ears antenna, but they were not.  There was a cable connecting TV to the wall.

* Sound isolation between rooms and between a room and the corridor is terrible.  I could hear doors opening and closing, and people in corridor and neighbors in their room speaking in normal voices (not screaming).  Then, I heard neighbors getting it on - ""Ai...  ai...   ai..."", but they were done quickly.  Thanks, man!

* I was annoyed that for the $20 ""resort fee"" the hotel does not provide anything of real value.  They just charge $20 to be able to advertise a low base rate.  The ""resort fee"" includes 2 small bottles of water per day, and WIRED internet connection.  They have WiFi on lower two floors but not in rooms.  In the room there is ONE ethernet cable coming out of the cable modem, so if you do not bring a laptop or a travel WiFi router, you can't use hotel's internet because tablets and smart phones do not have ethernet sockets.

* No mini fridge or hair dryer.  I did not think a modern hotel can have these two items not provided.

There was a line for mobile check in, which didn't work for most of us trying to check in on our phones. Staff was extremely unhelpful.
Got to my room. I had asked specifically to have a room on a higher floor, to stay away from the noises from the renovation. Ha.
I got a room on the 22nd or so floor. That room was last renovated in the early 90's or so it looked. I found a purple clip on nail and various peanuts on the floor. Obviously, they don't clean the room properly between guests. 
The walls between the rooms are a real joke. I heard ALL of the phone conversations from the room next door. And I heard when he flushed the toilet, and I head when he got back to the room, and I heard his alarm go off in the morning... you get the gist!

My girl was so tired and sleepy but could not sleep well because of those annoying incidents.

Please don't pay full price for this. I got it for $55 and was worth just that. 
2 stars because of the location, the ease of self parking, and something I really look for is ease of the hotel. Very easy access from Ur room to the casino and a quick walk, and Ur on the strip. I would stay again but not in a suite. O and the buffet was gd because it was free. So not worth the $18 for breakfast.

If you don't come early, then your pretty much out of luck on where you want to sit or you just might not even get a place to sit!  I love summer.  Women and bikinis make me happy.

We started by going to happy hour in the afternoon at The Café. I ordered Chicken Tikka. About 2.5 hours later, I started to break out in sweats and had to go to the bathroom multiple times. It kept me sick throughout the night including my dinner at a Brazilian steakhouse with the group of 15. I totally didn't get my money's worth b\/c I had only two plates before having to go back to my room.

I thought about all the things I ate and drink up until that point and I could not find any other explanation except for that Chicken Tikka. DO NOT ORDER IT!

After several hours of napping back in the room, I tried to get settled in and take out my luggage. That's when we found a number of problems. There was a bottle of KY Jelly in the drawer next to the bed, a bunch of trash in the drawer under the TV and the bathroom faucet was full of gunk.

I took photos of all three items and went to Guest Services to complain. The gentleman listened to my complaints and saw the pictures I took. He apologized and gave me a $50 credit and said he would get me another room that's equal or higher. I said since it's already 12am, I can wait until the morning. He said okay and someone will call me between 12pm and 5pm tomorrow.

The next day, we went for lunch and put the privacy card on the door. I still haven't received a phone call after 2pm So we went back to guest services to check the status.The gentleman told me that it looked like we are downgrading to another room. I was extremely frustrated and upset so I explained the whole situation to him. He had to get a manager (CeCe) to get me an upgrade. Cece comes and said there's nothing for me. I explained my situation again, showed her the pictures and then she had a change of mind. She gave me an upgrade and said someone will come up with room keys for me to a new room.

When we returned to the room, we realized the privacy card was gone from the door. Someone came in and cleaned our room. What the heck! So we got our keys a bit later and moved everything into the new room.

The new room was the Diamond Suite on the 18th floor. So we walk in and after a few steps,I stepped on a Cheeto on the floor. Then we found a pair of jeans in the bedroom, the shower handle was full of gunk and some of the lights did not work. Despite all of that, we were willing to deal with it b\/c at least there's no KY Jelly in the drawer. We started to unpack and I realized that my cigar cutter is gone. It was sitting on the table in my previous room. I'm pretty sure housekeeping took it.

The new room also didn't have a privacy card or an in-dining menu. I had to write a note on a piece of paper and stick it outside of my door for ""DO NOT DISTURB."" 

This was the most frustrating stay I've ever had in Vegas. Besides the location of the Monte Carlo, there is nothing to like about this place. It was dirty, I had my stuff stolen, my room was cleaned despite the privacy card and I got food poisoning from their food. I would not recommend anyone to stay here for all of the reasons above. If I had to do it all over again, I'd spend the extra money to stay elsewhere. It's not worth saving the few bucks per night.",7,4,0

The rooms here are quaint. I didn't have any crazy stains (thank god) like some other reviewers. In Vegas i don't know how much time all of you spend in your rooms but we were rarely there (and if we were there we were passed the hell out lol). beds are cozy, tv is a cube, and bathroom is presentable. again, nothing to woo you... it is what it is. 

what i love about the monte carlo is their food court. i don't eat too much, i'm more of a snacker. while vegas is full of amazing buffets i never get my money's worth. do i really want to shell out 40 bucks to eat one plate of pick and pull stuff? not really. ill take my dollar menu thank you! the food court is open all the time (i went at 3am to get a pizza at sbarro). they have your mcds, sbarro, subway, starbucks.. just to name a few. similar to a mall foodcourt only less crowded. big plus? it doesnt smell like casino in there! 

front desk people are friendly, they don't judge. me and my girl wandered into the lobby after a fun night at TAO only to realize we forgot what room we were staying in. we went up to the front desk attendant and explained our situation then she happily tended to us. thank god she didn't give us a ""these drunk b*tches"" look otherwise we wouldve exchanged some words.

At check-in we were given keys that didn't function, so after we schlepped all of our stuff up to the room, we had to go back down to the lobby and wait another 10 minutes to have a fresh key made. Apparently the front desk clerk didn't even check us into our room the first time around. Fortunately the second set worked, so we went in to freshen up and go have some fun.

The first sign we should have checked out and gone somewhere else was the hair all over the bathroom floor. The dirty toilet and tub faucet that ran (not a drip, either, but a steady stream) constantly weren't really promising signs either.

But, 21st b-day, right? We were *determined* to have fun! So we went down to the concierge to see where we could have the most fun. Since my niece turned 21 at midnight, we wanted to take her to someplace fun for dinner and a club after she was finally legal. The concierge sort of flipped through a book, pointed to a couple of places, but didn't really offer any suggestions,offer  to book us a table with bottle service - it was like they couldn't be bothered to put out the effort. I could have gone through any Vegas visitor's guide and done that. So, we did. Honestly, the waiter at brunch the next day was more helpful than any concierge at the Monte Carlo. He told us where the best clubs were and not only hooked my adorable niece and sorority sisters with wristbands for free entry and drinks, he also hooked up her four 40-something aunts with a smile. Too bad he was at Planet Hollywood!

Hoping that the first day was an aberration, we went down the next  to get directions to VegasStrEATs, an art and gourmet food truck event that was happening across the street from the El Cortez. This particular concierge had never heard of the El Cortez, though she spoke such broken English that it took several minutes of back and forth for me the get that she didn't know what we were talking about. While this was going on, the other 3-4 desk clerks around her pretended they didn't see what was going on. After asking if anyone else who worked there had *any* clue where it might be, one of the guys kind of dissmissively told me ""That's downtown"" and gave us a map. Which was nice, except it was a map of either the Strip *or* Downtown, without directions about how to get from one to the other.

We chanced taking directions from the valet anyway, but after an hour of driving around in some sketchy neighborhoods, we finally gave up. 

The only points I can give the place *at all* were the creepy-cool Engrish-style ad campaign for their Dragon Noodle House and its proximity to The Cupcakery. Everything else was just another bullet point in my ""Why I'll Never Stay at the Monte Carlo Ever Again, Ever"" list...",3,0,0

I've stayed in a variety of hotels, both high end, and low end. I give this hotel a solid 4. Our king-bed room was on a high floor. Initially we were given the choice of waiting for a high floor, or taking a lower floor ready room. The room we were given was right by the pool, which was quite loud. I wanted to get some r n r on this trip, so that wouldn't work. A quick call to the front desk, and twenty minutes later we were in a room on the 15th floor with a different view. The front desk staff was excellent.

The room was basic, but nice. It was quite roomy, especially the bathroom. The chairs were a bit worn, but other than that, it was quite comfortable. The water pressure for the shower was very strong, but that was perfect for me. I'm used to a low pressure shower. It was definitely better than I was expecting. Please note that there is a resort fee (seems standard for the hotels on the strip), which included bottled water, USA Today, and Internet (bring an adapter to plug in tablets, etc). There's also a Keurig maker, and 2 pods. 

We booked this hotel for the pool complex. The wave pool was fun, as was the lazy river. I actually had more fun strolling\/swimming, than in the hard-to-control inner tubes (5$ for rentals).  There's a larger pool where most adults hung out\/talked. There were a lot of chairs, some even in shade! I preferred the pool later in the afternoon. It was a bit more emptied out.

The location was great. There was a tram to the Bellagio (don't know why anyone would take a cab when a bit of walking got you anywhere for free), which gave us access to more hotels on the strip. There was a CVS down the block, and a Walgreens across the street. Go here first if you need anything, or want to buy drinks. Much better pricing! We were also next to the NY NY, which connected us to walkways to MGM, and Excalibur. From the MGM you can get the Monorail, and from Exacalibur, you can get to the trams to Mandalay Bay, and the Luxor. Also nearby is a discount ticket seller, which sold discounts to the local restaurants and many shows. We bought vouchers for the Buffet, and Cafe at the MC. The buffet was a bit of a let down, not much for vegetarians when it came to dinner. It was fine for brunch. I knocked down a star b\/c of the buffet. The Cafe was a tasty choice for sandwiches, etc.

The casino and hotel were much smaller in comparison to the nearby hotels, but we liked that. Being out of the hype was a relief. Can't comment on the table games, only played craps for a bit. But the staff seemed friendly. 

We went to the Blue Man Group show (so much fun!), and got discounts because we were hotel guests. Perfect. We also went to the Minus 5 bar, which was a lot of fun. Coolest place in the desert (yes I'm a dork).

Granted, MC is your more economical choice for staying on the Strip. I wasn't expecting anything extravagant, but after my experience here I would have gladly put down the $30 extra a night to stay at a decent hotel.  My terrible visit began with the hour-long wait to check in.  I know Thanksgiving weekend is mega busy for Vegas, but come on.  When I finally made it to the check-in desk, I was informed the room I booked was unavailable, and was assigned one equipped with handicap facilities. No big deal.  That is, until I got up to the room, pulled back the comforter, and discovered a pool of BLOOD on the the sheets! It was everywhere and so horrifically disgusting!! 

I immediately when back down to complain, where I had to wait another hour just to talk to someone.  When I finally did get a hold of a person, they were only willing to change out the sheets.  Uh, hell and no on that! My God, there was BLOOD on that freaking bed!  The MC staff acted like I was complaining about a full trash can or something!  

 I demanded a room change, even though they kept insisting there weren't any available rooms.  They kept giving off this whole, ""What's the big deal?"" attitude to the whole situation, which I was not having. Finally, after asking for a refund, they offered to upgrade my room for free.  The new room was decent, (of course though, the bathroom lights didn't work and we had to call and have them replaced) in that there did not appear to be blood on the bed, and since I had already wasted my whole day dealing with the MC staff I took it to try and salvage some vacation time.

Naturally, at check-out they tried charging me for the upgrade.  Dealing with MC was a nightmare.  I strongly urge others to avoid this place.  Overall, you really don't save that much compared with other hotels.   Save your time and sanity and go somewhere sanitary.",0,1,0

1. I reserved a king bed. I arrived before the allotted check out time and they said they only had 2 queens available. This was after standing in line for a bout 30 minutes to check in, the line wrapped around 3 times! Of course I was frustrated! What made matters worse is the man checking me in was RUDE. He said they would call me the next time when there would be a King room available. I asked to verify what number they would call me on and he mumbled out a phone number. 

I then told him that number did not sound right and told him my correct phone number, which he seemed to ignore. 

2. The 1st room was sad. There was pink mold in the shower. The remote to the TV did not work. I could hear everything from the next room over. 

Finally the next day after not getting called about an available king room, I went downstairs to the check in line and finally got the king room...but note they did not call me to tell me one was available. If I was not proactive I would still be stuck in the room for the next 3 nights. 

On top of all this they added 20 dollars for a resort fee! Which included two baby water bottles and WIRED internet...there was no wifi...who the heck uses WIRED internet anymore!

We began our Honeymoon here - booked a room for $59\/night off of a great Travelzoo deal.  Ended up upgrading for another $50\/night to a jacuzzi suite overlooking the strip and it was perfect - the room was huge with a great whirlpool in front of the window overlooking the MGM grand and the mountains.  The room had a surround sound DVD system, a very comfortable bed, a wet bar (we didn't do any entertaining, but it was a great place to put all our crap coming and going out of the room), and a large bathroom with a big shower and a separate room for the toilet.  For a little over $100 a night, we couldn't have asked for a better place to start our honeymoon!!  The hotel is clean, has great service and we liked the smell (each casino and resort has a different aroma pumped into it, in case you haven't figured it out...).  There IS construction going on around it, but it didn't bother us at all - the pool area was clean (nothing floating in the pool, and we were there at the beginning of October) and though there was construction going on, they are well past the bulldozing phase, so it was just some general noise in the background and was generally overshadowed by the music in the pool area.  The pools were great and the service was terrific.  Our bellman who helped us with our luggage on the way out was extremely nice and even tried to call friends in CA to help us find the name of a restaurant he wanted to suggest to us (we were heading to Malibu next).  

I've never been to Vegas and it was my wife's second visit (she previously stayed at Mandalay Bay) and we both absolutely loved it.  We weren't there for ""the scene"" or for gambling, so I don't know about any of that.  We loved the room, the service was great, the pool was just what we wanted, and it was a good deal. 

The only caveat to this: obviously their special deals are working for them, since when we first checked in, they could only put us in a regular room with two double beds.  We ended up doing the upgrade on the second night and they were very accommodating with the change.  The regular room wasn't anything special - but not dirty, dated or noisy like some of the other complaints.  I guess if you're not facing the strip it may be noisy because of the construction, but its not like the strip side is that quiet (it is the Vegas strip...) and we couldn't hear a peep in either room.  I think people may be getting ""dated"" confused with ""themed"" - yes, the fixtures are big and ornate and old fashioned looking... perhaps French-ish?  Perhaps even Monte Carlo-ish???

Upon check in at the GoldMember Mlife counter they had no idea about the promotion, after spending 15 minutes speaking to about 3 people there and standing around while they called around still I received to resolve. They issue was that I received my $200 food and bev credit and the upgrade strip room but nothing about a dinner and bottle of champagne. They advised me to go to my room and call the steakhouse. 

Went to my room and called the restaurant, no one there knew anything about a promo and advised me I needed to go back to the front desk. At this point I was frustrated and just wanted to start my vacation so I left it alone. 

The next morning I went back to the front desk. There I stood for about 45 min with Karen and finally she was able to resolve that it was $200 food credit and the dinner, advised me to make my reservation at the steakhouse and order the ""preshow"" menu. She stated she would notate my reservations so I wouldn't have any problem. 

Went to the steakhouse that evening (good food) I ordered the preshow menu and was very happy with the service there. Great server Brian. 

When checking into the Cher concert I went to the VIP line and they stated they didn't have my name as VIP . 

Went back to the counter the next morning to see how much of my food and bev credit was remaining as well as confirm the $300 dinner would be taken off and surprise surprise it wasnt. 

Karen was off today and the note was not specific enough. Again wasted another hour at the counter with little help from the ""Manager"" Zach . Man he was a piece of work, and kept repeating ""I dont know what the conversation you and Karen had was"" and instead of actually assisted me he kept assuring me I was wrong and even though I showed him THEIR website and my confirmation email he wasn't going to give it to me. 

ALL IN ALL I SPENT $400 FOR 1.5 DAYS IN VEGAS IN A RUN OF THE MILL ROOM WITH A STRIP VIEW. AND HALF THE TRIP WAS WASTED AT THE FRONT DESK COUNTER. DIDNT GET MY VIP CHECK IN AND MY $200 IN FOOD & BEV Should of just went to Mandalay Bay. Will never go here again.

Monte Carlo and its sister hotels charge a $9.50 ""Resort Fee"" PER NIGHT for which you get 2 (tiny-mini) bottles of water a day, a ""free"" newspaper each day (which are located in the lobby of the floor and everyone and their mother has access to), a pass for ONE person to go to their gym each day (which if you are a couple, the other has to pay), and the ability to print your boarding pass out at the hotel (which you can also do at the airport).    PLUS, you pay TAX on top of this fee!!  Seems like all of the major hotels in Vegas are starting to do this, so you should research and find out which ones don't or do - and how much it will cost you.  Basically, you are forced to pay this fee.
As for the hotel, it is okay - but it's not like the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay or one of the newer, nicer hotels.    Our room was missing the ""room number"" sign on the outside, so someone had to hand-write the number on the wall with a black Sharpie!  How ghetto.   I've already decided I am not going to stay there again.",0,0,0

First, we were conveniently dropped off at the taxi\/bus area, a quick walk inside and immediately you're in the lobby. Thus, I cannot speak for the parking situation. Our tour guide got everyone the room keys and the elevators are located near the food court where Starbucks and other eateries are located. So points right here. 

Now for the rooms, as other fellow Yelpers have mentioned, is this the most modern, beautiful, newest, grandest hotel? Nope, however, the rooms are pretty spacious, bathroom is big and plus I'm operating on 4 hours of sleep (which still might be too many hours for being here!) so you can tell I didn't spend to many hours in there. When in Vegas; one must play! 

Also, being somewhat centrally located where New York New York to my right and City Center and other resorts to my left is why I liked my stay here. 

The casino area is easy to navigate around and getting out to The Strip wasn't a maze. Starbucks being right off the elevators was major. Need my Starbucks!! And bonus, there are many eateries located right outside in the new T Mobile Arena. 

Overall, a new place I got to experience. I don't see why one couldn't not stay here.",4,1,2

I purchased a package through Expedia that included the airfare and hotel for 4 nights. I upgraded to a Spa Suite so I paid extra up front for a nicer room.

At check in the clerk tells me that I owe an additional $89 for a ""resort fee"". I told him we paid in full and was unaware that there was a resort fee but I paid it anyway just to get to the room.

First impression of the room is that it was spacious and nice. Nice bar, a couch and two chairs along with the king sized bed. The spa turns out to be a big bathtub, no jacuzzi, but ok, still romantic. 

After getting to the room we met with friends and decided to get a bite to eat and a few drinks. Well apparently the kitchen in the hotel closes at 10. We went to a connected restaurant that was not very good and last call was at 10pm. Double Barrel Roadhouse, expensive and poor quality food to boot.

Back to the room and getting ready for bed and try to connect to my computer only to discover there is apparently no wifi. I call the front desk. You are put on hold and then when it rang the person hung up. I called again and waited at least 10 minutes to speak to a clerk. I explained the problem and she said ""There is no wifi above the 3rd floor. You have a wired connection."" I was shocked that a ""resort"" hotel wouldn't have wifi in 2015. Any second rate chain hotel provides wifi to their customers. 

I then asked her what the resort fee was for. She said ""You get two complimentary bottles of water a day and coffee in the room along with the wired internet. You also get a free paper if you want one and access to the pool and spa.""

I was not a happy customer at that point and let her know that this was the first and last time I would be a customer. Forget using the ""wired"" internet if you have a tablet, not going to happen for you.

Beyond that the furniture looks like it came from a second hand store. The dresser and armoire showed some battle scars. The tile in the shower looks like it hadn't been thoroughly cleaned in some time as there was some black mold? in the grout lines.

This is not a premium resort, there are many other higher quality choices. Do yourself a favor and skip this place.",0,0,0

I booked the room through Expedia, and it was very decently priced, or so I thought. It turns out that the Monte Carlo is cheaper than other luxury hotels because they charge you for everything! 

- Waited about 15-20 minutes to check in. Employee was very rude and made an unfunny joke about my last name (I'm Asian)
- Friend asked me if they had wifi, employee told her very rudely that she should ask him directly
- Room was decent size. 18th floor, great view of City Center. 
- No minifridge (would be an extra charge)
- Room safe could only be used if you swiped your credit card
- Room looked older, inconvenient outlet locations, some did not work
- Room lacked lighting. Bathroom was very dark since there was only light near the sink. Shower area was very dark. 
- Hotel fee of $20 a day, plus 12% tax on that fee. This is supposed to cover 2 Keurig coffee cups, 2 half size bottle of waters, newspaper, in-room internet (Ethernet, they don't have wifi here), etc. You only get these things if you have the staff come and clean your room.
- The coffee maker was pretty annoying in that it did not recognize the glass cups they provide. They will only recognize coffee mugs. However, when we called the staff, they said we would be charged EXTRA for coffee mugs.
- The room also does not have a corkscrew, so we had to order one for $4.50 plus tax from the hotel. Our $4.86 corkscrew http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/oIggWgX.jpg
- The bed sheets (http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hsa3FTN.jpg), pillowcases (http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/63A3HJj.jpg), and towels (http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/W6Oi40d.jpg) had stains
- The carpet did not look vacuumed, as I found many sequins on the floor along with a Victoria Secret price tag
- The walls for the room were VERY thin. I could literally hear every conversation from the neighbors crystal clear. I could even hear their alarm going off at 10 AM. 

Other than that, the casino area was fine, and there was a food court with McDonald's etc which came in handy when we wanted a quick meal. Great central location with easy access to Aria, Bellagio, etc. Overall, I honestly had a better stay at the Circus Circus hotel than here. I expected much more from a hotel with a 4 diamond rating. I wouldn't even put this hotel in the same ranking as the New York New York or the Paris hotel. Would not come here again.",0,0,0

For the price of the room and the resort fee... it was extremely boring and lacked additional seating.  Not all of the lights worked and it just seemed mediocre.  I stayed for 2 nights.  The room was never cool and the ac barely blew even after i adjusted it.  The bed was the absolute worst.  The pillows were extremely lumpy but were like twice as high as regular pillows...the bed itself somehow set off every single pressure point in my back... so after 2 days... my sister and i limped out of there as it felt like I would have been better suited to have slept on the concrete outside of this old hotel.,0,0,0

I was greeted by the warmest person and told me where to go and she will looked after my bag while I checked in.
The lobby looks nice and classy.
However they have no king bed for me and make me pay $10-$15 to get a king bed - ripped off!
The room was a bit bare, no fridge? My bedsheets was actually dirty, like dirt and when I pull up the top sheets, the bottom sheets was dirty as well.
In the bathroom, there is a shampoo, a conditioner, a body lotion and a soap. Very basic for the rave review I received!

For some unfortunate reason Monte Carlo is located so damn conveniently for my family that we have a hard time going with any other hotel.  This time we figured upping our budget and booking suites might make the experience less unpleasant.  Alas, throwing money at the problem did not make it go away.  If anything, we were left even more disappointed.  

Let me tell you right now the Diamond suite looks NOTHING like the pictures you see in their marketing material.  NOTHING.  The pictures will lead you to believe you're booking a modern and stylish yet comfortable room.  And then you enter the chamber of horrors: the carpets are old, dirty and disgusting: I was again grossed out by the idea of walking on them, even while wearing socks!  The furniture is painfully outdated: the gigantic old-fashioned sectional takes up most of the space in the living room section. There is still one of those enormous wooden entertainment units in one corner of the room with a sad lonely TV sitting in it and drawers that just fly open at random intervals and stay half open all day, staring you in the face, empty, like you've been robbed.

The bathroom sinks are beige with gold faucets- the kitchen sink black with gold faucets- the shower and the entirely useless Olympic pool sized jacuzzi all come with gold fixtures and accents, management appears to have a hard time letting go of the 80's; maybe it's because Trump is so in right now.  The toilets, another beige offering are so old that after years of cleaning, the original paint inside has worn off and been replaced with a million black lines instead.  Most of their roll-away beds are broken and useless.  Need I go on??  Well, alright...

...on top of the terrible rooms, ever since they removed the nice fountain and statues from the exterior, and replaced them with a regular run of the mill coffee shop and that loud dreadful pub style restaurant, this hotel has completely lost its character - I am not sure what look they are going for, probably trying to appeal to the young and the brainless, but it's just not a unique place any more.  

And to round up my list of endless complaints: we had to pass on the pool because the water was not clean - which, after a holiday weekend with lots of super hygienic things going on in there, you'd think they'd put extra effort into maintaining, but nope.

The staff are nice enough, the food is okay and the size of the place is ideal, not too big, not too small, but my god, this poor hotel is in desperate need of remodeling.",3,0,0

Hotel rooms are nice - usually very clean and well maintained. Parking is very accessible to the hotel - not as much walking as other spots on the Strip. Staff is friendly and pleasant. Decent location and with a tram stop going to Bellagio and another just down the Strip that goes from Excalibur to Mandalay Bay, it's easy to get around there. 

Low key Sports Book that is often not too busy, which makes it nice for those of us who use it.

Overall I give it a 3. The bf and I met 4 friends in Vegas and all together we had 3 rooms. Good: our room was clean, was in the location of the hotel that we requested (strip side) but then again, if we were paying for the strip view then should I really be congratulating them on giving me what I paid for? Cost was very reasonable - Took advantage of a 20% off strip view promo which brought the price down to about $70 per night. The Resort Fee gets you - but I'd imagine that all of the hotels charge that. Location was fine especially for not paying top dollar. The hotel's pool area was a 4 out of 5. The pool options were great and the time spent in the water was a good time. The lazy river was perhaps our favorite. I had never seen a wave pool so that was a fun new experience. You could bring your adult beverages into the water with you. I did not like the lounge chair set up in the pool area. Very little seating surrounded the pools themselves and since it was crowded you often got stuck in seats that were just rows upon rows of lounge chairs staring at more lounge chairs. I would have liked to see more seating around the pool so that I could be soaking in the rays while watching my friends in the water. Lastly, I'd like to give a shout out to The Pub - a restaurant in the hotel. We ate there twice and I only wish I had more opportunities to eat there more. The service and food were great, the beer list never ending. Something like 200 beers on tap and the staff could talk about the beer and answer questions to help you choose - much appreciated. 

Now for my Not So Good remarks. The customer service is horrendous. So much so that after a few incidents my party and I were telling them we would not be staying here again. I had called the hotel 3 weeks before our arrival and had all three reservations linked together so that all 3 rooms would be on the same floor. We arrive and this had not been done. Then, they put 2 of the rooms on a smoking floor when specified was nonsmoking. They then tell us that the rooms were not linked together because we got there after 5pm - however the customer service rep I spoke to when putting in the request said nothing to me about that being a requirement nor about it not being definite. It was confirmed and sounded taken care of when I ended my conversation 3 weeks prior. The person we dealt with at concierge said that the nonsmoking room was merely a preference and not a guarantee. Really?! Perhaps it is their liberal smoking laws in the state of Nevada - but that seems like a big ""request"" that should be fulfilled. When we showed obvious dissatisfaction over the lack of rooms together, and 2 rooms being completely filthy in cigarette smell, the concierge did nothing to ease our discomfort and the reply was very much like, ""oh well, nothing we can do for you..."". Eventually we were able to get the two smoking rooms on the same floor as the third room, but it required a night in the disgusting smoke filled rooms 5 floors down. The next day when the other two rooms were reassigned, one of them was without a strip view - we were paying for the strip view. This was not determined until we had left the concierge, had gone all the way upstairs to move bags into the new room, and noticed the view was not as requested. The person we dealt with should have known what we were paying for, and said something at the time of switch that either there was no strip viewavailable and given our money back for paying extra for it, or made other arrangements. But instead we had to go back downstairs, wait in line again to speak with someone - and explain the situation once more. Again, all this running around, room change, lack of reading the computer to see what was on our account - certainly required some sort of compensation. We finally got something after speaking to a manager. The 1st room was fine, the 2nd room got 50% back on the first night spent in the smoke room, and the 3rd room ended up without a strip view, and they gave us back the extra money that paid for that view. It took multiple trips to the concierge desk to get this made right, and it wasn't until speaking to a manager that any compensation happened. The desk people were very passive and did not seem interested in making us happy.",3,0,0

First off, I had reserved my room via Expedia for a Single King, Non Smoking.  At approx 830am I asked to check in early and was willing to pay extra to get room so I would not have a hassle doing so later and that my belongings would be in the room. When I did check i I was told Early Check in would cost $20 more then told that I would have to be upgraded costing me another $10. When given the room key I went to the room only to find the Bathroom torn apart and tools spread all over the floor. I then went back down to the Front Desk to find a huge line so I went to the Concierge how told me they would text me immediately with the room number and gave me a set of room keys. I then had to check my luggage with Bell Hop since I could not put them in a room, thus costing me a tip when dropping off and picking up to ensure they took great care of my luggage. 

Approx 330 while at my conference I noticed I had NOT received a phone call or text telling me a room was ready!!! So in panic that I may not have a room I left my Conference and ran back to the Front Desk which was again a huge line. I went to the Concierge Desk again and explained the issue. They Issued me a room number yet bnot once mentioned that I was still in an upgraded room. When I arrived to my room it was a Single King in Non Smoking....so I dint think of it at all.

When playing slots in the hotel for 2 hours I had ordered a Coke after 15 minutes and the Server walked past me more than a dozen times never bringing me my Coke!!!!!

At 9 am the maid walked into my room without waiting to hear my rsponse and was halfway into my room as I yelled out. The Next morning when checking out I noticed an additional $40 charge, when I went to the Front Desk I was met with a rude attitude and no regard for customer service. I asked for a Supervisor who provided the same type of disregard to Customer Service and I verbally voice my opinion. They Stated that I checked in early and was upgraded......Is that what you call service?

You wonder why I took so long to respond....? Being a Business Owner I have my own Customers to ensure they receive the service they should expect and have been extremely busy. I hate having to make a statement to prove my self as a customer yet to receive such hideous service is uncalled for....

I thought about calling my bank to contest the funds, write to headquarters, BBB and others to get my $40 back yet the time has been costly. So lesson Learned, Never Again will I stay at the Monte Carlo or allow my Friends and Family to do so if at all possible.

Your Service sucks and if Employees and Supervisors have a chip on their Shoulder they should revisit Who actually puts money in their pocket.....Customers if you didn't know. 

As a Company you should find a means to amend this dishonor to a customer.",2,0,0

Our reservation was originally for the Orleans Hotel and Casino for the onsite children's center and we had arrived and walked into the Orleans Hotel and was immediately assaulted by the overwhelming stench of cigarette smoke and perfume used to cover the smoke smell.

So, we left the casino to stay at the Monte Carlo for the lazy river and wave pools and were very happy with our stay.  Any small issue we had was corrected immediately, the place is clean and they have an all day-all you can eat buffet for a decent price!

BAD:  no wifi, in room dining staff did not take away the cart for two days.   We called them to take it away as they instructed us to do and we left it in the hall and when we left two days later- it was still there.   Most of the table dealers have no personality.

We are locals so we never venture out to the strip due to our work schedules and well the strip isn't our thing!

Monte Carlo was just what we needed. Alongside from the construction, it was quiet. We stayed on the 29th floor, room 134, which was the pool view and it was nice and quiet for us. The other casinos at night looked pretty from our room and we were still able to see the sun rise and set from bed! The room was nice, nothing super luxurious but nothing like motel 6. It was just right for us and it was pretty cheap, alongside other hotel rooms. The toilet though was the main issue, as it was having issues flushing, we had to call maintenance twice. The shower is tiny so no romantic bath time there lol! The pool wasn't bad, the lazy river is smaller than the pictures, gets crowded easily. Needs more shade! But other than that it was good. Oh and there needs to be more pool staff to take orders, I waited a half hour for someone to come take my drink\/food order. Also the food court area, don't go to Manchu Wok, the food is gross, overly expensive and there are unprofessional ppl behind the counter. It's embarrassing.

We would normally find ourselves at the Bellagio, so it was incredibly convenient that there is a free tram that connects Monte Carlo to Crystals to Bellagio. 

The casino and the rooms felt a little outdated. The room looked minimally clean, but upon closer inspection, the beds were dirty with black specks and I found little bugs in the room. I think the bugs may have come in from when they cleaned our room and had forgotten to close the windows...On our last day, we were attempting to check out in our room, but we weren't able to because the TV was doing something funky upon choosing that option. It's no big deal because we ended up checking out downstairs, but it was my understanding that checking out in our rooms was a simple convenience that most other hotels had. Eh. I wouldn't come here to shop since there weren't many options, I wouldn't come here to gamble, and there's no major attraction that Monte Carlo can boast outside of the Blue Man Group.

Pros:
- FAST CHECK-IN: this could not have been easier, very straightforward
- GOOD MAID SERVICE: Housekeeping started coming around early on our floor (like 8:00AM) and the maids were very nice about giving us extra shampoo every day
- CONCIERGE DESK: we were able to pick up our tickets for shows at other MGM hotels at the Monte Carlo, which was super convenient!
- TRAM TO CRYSTALS AND BELLAGIO: in 100+ degree heat, the air-conditioned tram service to the city center and Bellagio hotel was a godsend.  
- EXPRESS CHECKOUT: there are a number of ways to easily check out of the hotel (checkout is at 11:00AM) and the hotel really wants to streamline checkout so that there aren't a ton of people clogging up the lobby like it is at other hotels
- FOOD COURT: because not every meal in Vegas has to take place in a buffet or a pricey restaurant.  There's Starbucks, McDonalds, Subway, Sbarro pizza, Nathan's hot dogs, Mexican, etc here and is great if you're traveling with kids.  

Cons:
- WHERE'S THE GUIDEBOOK?: usually when I stay at a hotel, there's some sort of binder or guidebook that they leave for their guests that gives info about room service, Vegas shows, restaurants in the hotel, etc... for some reason there wasn't one in our room, so my husband and I were forced to keep the Monte Carlo channel on TV on endless loop to find out info about the hotel and things to do.  
- TOO MANY CHAIRS AT THE POOL: I don't know why they do this, but they've packed the pool area with so many lounge chairs that it is literally like sardines in a can.  It's uncomfortable and makes it very awkward to get back and forth from your chair.  
- LAZY RIVER TOO PACKED: maybe the concept of a lazy river has evolved since the last time I was in one, but getting into the Monte Carlo lazy river is like pulling into rush hour traffic on the 5.  Like the chair situation, it's congested and uncomfortable.  

Other useful things to know:
- There's a little shopping section next to the food court that has a big candy store, women's clothing, bath accessories, cupcakes, frozen-yogurt, and crepes... Monte Carlo is trying really hard to cater to people who don't necessarily want to spend all their time gambling and clubbing and\/or people with kids
- Guests were bringing large coolers packed with bottles of spring water (and other beverages) because it's $5.50 per bottle of water at the hotel
- You can't bring outside food or drink into the pool area and your bag WILL get checked for it
- Inner tubes can be rented from the pool area for the lazy river, and after 2PM they're only $5 each
- If you forget sunscreen or other toiletries, don't purchase from the Monte Carlo convenience store, the prices are outrageous!  Instead, walk across the street to ABC Store or Walgreens, or try the 24-hour CVS just 1 block down the strip.",5,0,1

First, I'll point out that it's cheaper than most places on the strip, there's a McDonald's inside in the food court (great for breakfast and when you don't want to spend $80 on dinner), and the casino is pretty good.  Also, the location of the MC, with the help of the tram, is pretty darn good.  All of these things make for at least 3 stars. 

However, having stayed at a bunch of other hotels on The Strip, this place was the worst from a room comfort perspective.  The rooms were built in the 80s or something and they certainly show it.  There are cracks and mold in the bathroom tile, the showers aren't great, the carpet is stained, and the fixtures are way out-dated.  I guess I'm a bit of a snob, but I couldn't see past all of that.  I stayed here for a few nights and then stayed at the Bellagio for a few nights, and the difference in comfort level is pretty staggering - to me.

My hubby and I come to Vegas 1-2 times a year and tend to move around, never the same hotel twice. We got a great deal on the Monte Carlo Spa Suite so figured why not? Sure the MC is bit old, but its location next to the City Center is awesome! 

We arrived a few hours before check-in, but they let us check in at noon. Score! We took a short walk to the elevators and headed up to the 31st floor. The spa suite didn't disappoint! Sure it has a bit of an older style (brass fixtures, carpet and sofa have seen better days), but the view from the jacuzzi is out of this world (strip\/mountain view)! It also had a king size bed, sitting area, bar area and decent size bathroom (although no double sinks). And it came with robes and slippers. 

The room was very clean and the maid service was prompt. When I had to call down for a hair dryer (none in the room), they got it up to me in 10m! Room service was prompt and good also. And all in all it was a good stay. 

My only complaints are 1) they really need new windows, we could hear the screams from the NYNY roller coaster riders some nights - with the windows and curtains shut! 2) Their resort fee of $20\/day is a joke. It gives you bottled water (which we only got 1 day of 3), free phone calls (!? um, who doesn't have a cell) and a paper every day. Oh and WIRED internet access. Here is one place MC needs to get current - wifi please! 

Other than that, we really like the location and the hotel itself. It was nice to be close to all the newer spots on the strip without paying the big bucks. This place is small, but that is nice sometimes - less walking!

This is one of the most BS hotels in Vegas. When booking and scheduling, not once did they mention the hotel was under construction and remodel. Half the restaurants for the place are closed and you wind up walking to another resort to eat. They basically have a mall type food court, or $55 per person buffet.

The rooms and amenities are old and dingy, furniture is scratched as hell, my floor and room constantly smelled like pot. The walls are paper thin and you can't sleep if your neighbor is making any kind of noise at all.

The staff is semi friendly, but regardless, the hotel is completely understaffed. You're going to wait In a ridiculous line to get coffee, water, etc. There is no real connivence items in the room, coffee maker, water, etc., and there isn't even a pay bar in the room either. It's BS..!! Curtains don't close all the way, room temperature is always in the 80s, no matter what you set the AC at.  Room service is constantly moving your shower\/bath items, including taking the soap. You have to open new soap everyday..???

During our stay, every single day a maid attempted to enter (let me assure you that we displayed ""DO NOT DISTURB"" remember, we were on our honeymoon!)

- Bed was disappointing.. pillows were stiff, blanket and sheets were uncomfortable and cheap. There was not even a fitted sheet to cover the mattress--literally just a normal sheet thrown over it and tucked under! Needless to say it came off the mattress when slept on.
- We were not told at check-in that we were booked in a handicapped room. This meant the shower was really ugly and practically impossible to use--showerhead was like 5 feet tall. Floor in the shower made a loud creaking noise when you moved around. The dial to control the temperature was broken. What a JOKE. At least ASK us at check-in if we want the handicapped room with the shitty shower!
- I always use the extra lock on the door at night in hotels, but there was not one on the door. I forgot to put the ""do not disturb"" sign out the first night, and at 10am housekeeping knocked once and opened the door. My boyfriend and I were still sleeping. Naked. I screamed. Not cool. Checkout time is 11.. Why would you have maids going around before 11 cleaning rooms?
-Tried to get in a mid-day nap. That was useless. Pool party was raging EXTREMELY LOUDLY outside, and we could hear all of it, even on the 25th floor. I understand it's vegas and people want to rage at the pool, but seriously, sound-proof those windows or some shit.
- Watched some TV, and every 10 seconds the screen would get all messed up with static. Really? 
-NO WIFI IN THE ROOMS! There was a cable to plug in to your laptop, but we couldn't even get that to work! 


Overall: Surely you could find more disappointing hotel rooms, but this place was just not very nice at all. Needs a facelift... updated decor and bedding for sure. I expected more from a place that really TRIES to look luxurious.

-  It is in the middle of some major construction sites (i.e. 5 buildings in the new Las Vegas CityCenter).  Therefore, do not expect the environment to be plesant at all.  Even the hotel staffs admitted that ""every customers who has a room facing the constructions conplained about the noise and dust""...

-  The hotel recently had a major fire on the top floor in January.  Although the exterior of the hotel has been restored, they are closing all the top floor.  As a result, most of the room do not offer much of a view even you are facing the strip.  I can only see the pipes on the roof of the casino from my strip-view room.  But I guess it is still better than the rooms facing the construction

-  I read a lot of positive reviews about their pool before I went, but was extremely disappointed.  Their pools are extremely small, and none of them except the kids' pool is heated.  Coupled with the fact that the constructions are blocking the sun, you can only see a handful swim in them....

-  Mediocre Service: It looks like their rooms with King bed is extremely limited.  I asked for one, and the staffs was so rude as if I am asking for an upgrade.  They finally assigned me one, but  I had to check back with the front desk 3 times after I checked in to see if my room is ready.  At the end, they cannot make it ready until 5pm....

Don't get me wrong, it's an above average place to stay at, clean, semi-new, on strip, and decently priced--but my experience didn't thrill me or anything. Stayed here for four days, three nights and all during that time everything was ok. It's not a destination hotel like MGM, NYNY, Mandalay, Paris, or Planet Hollywood. It's a good place to stay if you not looking for a lot of action and a nice bed with a clean room.

The room was nicely furnished and it was a handicap room, but that really didn't bother us. What did bother us was that the first night we were there we had problems with water drainage in the shower\/tub. Water just wasn't draining fast enough and the tub started filling up. Needless to say that was not good. It didn't bother us too much as the next day we called maintenance and by the time we came back from going out for the day they had fixed it.

Probably the bigger issue I had was that the lot they had for self parking was not big enough to accommodate everyone at the hotel. Apparently what had happened was that as part of the City Center construction which is happening right next door, they demolished their parking structure and are currently in the process of building a new one. In the meantime, they have an open air lot that is not big enough to hold everyone. So at night what happens is people are driving around hunting and waiting for parking to  open up. You might say, ""well why don't you valet the car, it's free."" That is a good idea, too bad almost everyone else has it as well. One night after we had come back we go to valet the car and the line for the valet is packed, come to find out that the valet is full for the night and we have to park at NYNY, which is also right next door. Luckily as we were driving through the small lot to go over to the NYNY someone pulled out and we were able to park in the self park.

My friend and I both work in customer service and we understand that customers can be terrible people. They are not always right. So, naturally we hate complaining about anything and even when we do, we do it with a smile and the empathy that not everything is in your control as an employee. 

However, there seemed to be a distinct lack of customer service and overall upkeep during our simple one night stay at the resort.  We moved rooms twice and there was a problem in all three rooms we had. 

We paid for early check in and our first room wasn't even clean. There were towels on the floor, a trash can in the tub, dirty drinking glasses on the desk, and a distinct layer of dust on everything. We called the front desk and they changed our room.

The second room initially had no problems. Then I took a shower and after I was done, the faucet wouldn't stop loudly dripping\/trickling water. We decided to just give it time and went out for the day. Upon our return and subsequent outlet search to plug in our phones, my friend found that someone had written REDRUM on the wall. While honestly kind of funny, it was rather unnerving and we didn't want to be charged for graffiti so we called the front desk again and our room was changed.

Our third and final room had an AC unit with a banshee call that could wake the dead. At this point, we were tired of moving and tired of bothering the front desk, so we just turned it off and went to bed. 

While the staff was great at dealing with our room problems, every other time we came into contact with someone else, it was not a pleasant experience. We wanted to know where to stow our bags before our flight left after we had already checked out. The MLife check out desk woman looked like she was trying to ignore her customers rather than deal with them as we had stood in line for a while and she didn't even look us in the eye once. We were there a good while before we gave up and moved onto the regular check out line where the woman there also barely looked us in the eye before barking out, ""Bell desk!"" and gesturing in its direction. The lady at the bell desk just scowled at us before gesturing  to the bellman standing behind us (who turned out to be one of the nicest people we came into contact with). She then went back to some conversation she was having with another bellman. 

To top it all off, my friend ended up talking to the manager on duty who tried to smooth everything over with a $50 lunch voucher to Diablo's which unbeknownst to us, but should have been known to her, was closed for the season.

Check in was pretty simple. They were able to accommodate our party on the same floor which was great. 
 We upgraded to a Monaco suite solely for the whirlpool tub. We got to our room and we had just a normal tub. I called to find out why our suite did not include this and they informed us that the health and safety department made them take the jets out. Totally fine, but considering we upgraded for that purpose and the website as well as their brochure states that's what the suite included I was a little irritated that they did not notify us about this or at least give us the option to cancel our upgraded room. Our bed was lumpy and we didn't get much of a good nights rest the first night. 

I contacted the front desk about it and they didn't really do anything, just said sorry. The next day I was pretty peeved and decided to speak with the manager. He really wasn't of much help anyway and offered to move us back into a standard room. We booked at this hotel for the spa, why would we want to downgrade!? I wanted to take a epic bubble bath in the comfort of my room!!!

I basically had to ask for them to move us into a spa suite that had not yet been converted. Finally They did after I explained how messed up it was for them not to inform us. It took forever for our room to be ready. They sent me a text saying it was ready so I went back to the room to confirm, only for them to tell me the text was sent prematurely and the room wasn't ready. We spent all day really waiting for our room and at around 4 ish, it finally was. 

The room was nice once we got there. Bed was MUCH more comfy. But honestly, there was too much work trying to get into a room that we paid for. This is a good place if you just want a place to lay your head and not actually ""relax"". I would definitely stay elsewhere!",3,1,1

I must say, March is not the best time to visit Vegas unless you have a reason to be there.  Spring break, march madness, some sort of junior soccer convention, and everyone's bachelor\/bachelorette parties resulted in high hotel prices.  In comparison to the other hiked up prices of rooms along the strip, the Monte Carlo offered a modest deal of $130\/ night plus the $20\/night resort fee.

Honestly, it's not worth that much to stay here.  The room was okay, the hotel appeared to be clean and orderly, and front desk was friendly -- but for $150 is coconuts.  

Biggest peeve.  Rooms don't have wi-fi.  They have internet but you need to plug it in to your laptop.  The cable that they provide in the room is attached to the wall so you have to work on it AT the table -- you can't bring your laptop to your bed.

I order to get a room cleaned, they don't clean it. I call again(after the club) and ask for them to PLEASE clean my room that they are too busy to clean apparently. 

So , I get a lady to clean my room. The lady this hotel sent me to clean my room was either on drugs, or was on 2 hours of sleep. So after she cleans my room, I tip her and go to  bed (finally with a clean room for gods sake). 

When I wake up in the morning, I am ready to go to wet republic (mgm grand hotel). Making sure I have all my necessities for the club , out of no where, my California drivers license is gone. I was for certain that I had my ID at the moment I got my room cleaned. 

So , monte Carlo got my ID STOLEN, and then I got the ""pleasure"" to meet their hotel manager, Jamie Schmidt. I have never dealt with a more unreasonable, uncaring manager in my life. 

Worst customer service, she was rude, uncooperative under their mistaking circumstance. After the fact, she had the nerve to tell me that it was my fault for leaving my driver's license on my bed sheets. She insisted that I was too irresponsible to not tell the cleaning lady to be careful about my Very Important ID that is obviously needed for anything as a 21+ adult. 

Due to this unfortunate turn of events, my stay in Vegas was stressful and wasteful (not how my vacation should have gone). 

I highly reccomend to never deal with this hotel and their very poor and lacking customer service. 

Jamie Schmidt should consider another job opportunity\/profession; she doesn't seem to have the intellect to give people a clear and concise answer to questions of concern. Her communication skills are poor (stutters); she doesn't seem to care about your stay, as long as you have your credit card on file, that's all she needs. She will not compensate anything for you, even if it is 100% the hotel service's fault for an inconvenience.

Monte Carlo resort should be looked away from. They ruined my vacation trip with 0% compensation for their mistake.

Monte Carlo is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at on the strip! DO NOT stay here! Unless you like unclean rooms, horrible customer service and the worst management team possible. I had my son's birthday party at MC and I regret it! I did group booking 9 months in advance and booked multiple rooms. The noise coming from the outside was so bad that I couldn't sleep, rooms were completely outdated and I am not sure how they get away with that. It was also told to me when reserving the multiple room booking that we were guaranteed to be near each other in the hallway since we are a large party. However, upon each check in, the front desk kept trying to place them on other floors and different wing. One room had to switch rooms halfway into their stay to finally get the room they were promised. 
Upon speaking with the front desk manager and concierge manager the second morning of my stay, before any of our guest had arrived, they told me that to help with the noise... ""here are some ear plugs"". Then they began telling me about not being able to hold my gift baskets.
I was told that I could have gift baskets at the concierge desk for when each guest arrived, but they were unsure if they could hold them for me. I ended up having to be downstairs to greet each guest on arrival to give them their baskets. It was over the whole day I had to keep going upstairs to get the gift, then run down to meet them.
Between no sleep, being promised things they did not hold up their end and it was my son's 21st birthday which I'm trying to make perfect... this was not going well!

I decided to walk away after standing there so upset and the managers promise to send up blankets, pillows, and to have all my guests next to us. NONE OF THAT HAPPEND.
I never went back to the front desk during my stay, because if I did, the whole hotel would have heard me!

It took me 2 days after I returned to calm down and email the Monte Carlo Hotel to explain to them what they did wrong to a customer who had many people stay and spend money at the hotel. The way they treated us was UNBELIEVEABLE and HORRIBLE.

Which is something he was really looking forward to.  Going to Vegas to celebrate sounded like a great idea at a time. I guess we should've did more research on the hotels. First off it was way to families &  kids running around everywhere makes an adult feel weird about drinking in front of kids. Second the check-in my was super Duper long and moving slow like you were the themepark! Third the front desk clerk didn't really know anything and had to call to see what was going on, then proceeds to tell us that there would be an additional $50 a day charge plus $20 daily resort fees on the spa room that we booked which was fine for deposit but daily deposits on the same room that your staying in for a consistent number of days I just didn't understand that!! & the part that made me upset was it didn't mention any of this online.. So instantly I felt like we were getting ripped off I think hidden fees are just wrong I'm sorry people should know what they're looking forward to spending ahead of time and not thrown for a loop when you get there. 
So then I asked my husband let's just be sure and ask the lady at guest services; she goes on to Tell us in a very nasty way oh she should have charge you'll  $100 a night deposit for the spa suite! I looked at her and said well you all should list these prices and fees on your website and not trick people once they get to your hotel for their stay. But anyway they told us they no longer honor the birthday comps or  coupons they offer on their site so he was kind of feeling down about that but was like oh well. The buffet which he really looked forward to going to was very overrated this was in their hotel!! Way too pricey for the little bit of stuff they offered and it was self-service.. In the mornings the housekeeper knocked then just entered the room so if you were unclothed or indecent she just barged in!! 
The cocktail waitresses never came back if u happened to see them you have to run them down for one.. Which when some people are gambling it's kind of nice to not have to chase a drink down..

BEST FEATURE: Right next to the CVS!!! Easy to access to the strip and shopping. It's absolute BEST FEATURE.

POKER ROOM: About a quarter of the size of Bellagio. Not the biggest poker room. It was nice enough. Played a tourney there. It was okay but I like bigger rooms.

There's a new ""Street of Dreams"" shopping area that leads to the monorail. That will take you to ARIA, Bellagio and other hotels. Pretty convenient. 

I saw security in the hallway making sure that a couple having a ""discussion"" was not actually having a disruptive ""argument"" - I'm grateful to that. I detest rowdiness unless I am the creator of it.

Did not visit the pool as it was winter.

The room was excellent and the service was impeccable. They really made me feel welcome and tended to my needs. I got there very early at around 11:30am and they let me do an early check in for only $20.  Before you cheapos complain, let's remember that's $20 for early check in on a suite. 

I really liked the atmosphere at this hotel. It was fancy without overdoing it. No wacky gimmicks or anything. Just a really well done hotel and casino. Far from being trashy like Excalibur but not as fancy pants as Bellagio.  Sure, you see people that look out of place and probably cashed in their MyVegas rewards for a free room but it's OK.

What I like: the bed was incredibly comfortable. I could have slept all day in it. I like the fact that they now have a tram to Bellagio, which is super convenient. Easy check in\/out. Shorter ride from the airport, so lower cab fare. Two Starbucks on site. I've had great luck on certain slots (better than any other casino). Choice of a couple restaurants that I would pay 2nd visits to (Dragon Noodle & Diablo's Cantina). Nice pools. The casino always smells fresh. Free printing of boarding passes. Great deals if you sign up for their e-mails - but then again, I feel like you get what you pay for (we paid $39 a night for two nights and $49 for the 3rd). I really like the makeup mirror in the bathroom (when it wasn't fogged up).

My complaints: (and these are all from this visit) Easy to hear people walking down the halls, and TVs through the walls. We stopped back at our room mid-afternoon one day to nap so we could stay out late, and finally gave up because we could hear conversations and the TV from our neighboring rooms. 

The bathroom has no ventilation fan, and no light above the shower. We ended up showering with the bathroom door open so we weren't fogged in. The shower was pretty dark. Also, in our room this time, the hair dryer was near death.

We don't order room service, but had we wanted to there was no menu or any hotel related binder with hours of restaurants\/spa\/pool etc. 

I know we stayed in the standard room, but a dozen channels on a TV that isn't LCD\/plasma doesn't really cut it for Vegas standards. We don't go to Vegas to watch TV, but we usually have it on for a few minutes before going to bed. 

The decor was average. I wouldn't call the room outdated, but there was nothing that made it stand out. Again, we were in a standard room, other rooms at higher price points may be decorated more stylish.

Lately, though, I've been staying at MGM more and more often just because the other properties seem to be going downhill.  Monte Carlo is one such property.

Casino:

The casino was OK and had a good vibe.  My only annoyance here was a pit boss totally ignoring me betting $20-$30 per round on roulette because I was using the $1 chips (it was a $5 minimum table at the time).  After several rounds he finally came over and offered to explain how the comps work and that we need to bet a lot more than the minimum to be noticed.  Really?  Well if you'd been watching, you'd have seen that I just dropped $400 on the stupid table.  He did try to make up for it once he noticed how annoyed I was, though, so that was cool.  Also, it didn't help that the dealer at the roulette table was totally uninterested and kept looking off in the distance and yawning.  I don't think the employees are very happy here.

Hotel:

The hotel is ""eh"".  My standard rant at any of these properties are their so called ""queen sized"" beds.  They are NOT queen sized beds!  They're doubles!!  Don't advertise that you're getting a queen size when it's a tiny little double!!  The pillows were like 2 foot tall bricks the first night.  I asked housekeeping for better pillows for the second night and they brought some feather pillows up which were much nicer.

The rooms are VERY loud.  I could hear people coughing and sneezing a floor up and below from me and also next door.  The plumbing is really really loud, too, and at one point was making a really loud hummm for hours.   I was awoken each morning around 6AM  and couldn't get back to sleep because of all of the noise.  Not a good way to encourage me to stay up all night gambling :(

My mom has stayed at the Monte Carlo years ago and she loved it. So we decided to stay here since all the other hotels were booked. We get to the hotel and wanted to see if we could get the same floor to my sister in laws room since she as well was staying at the hotel. They told us that was possible but our room wouldn't be ready until FIVE PM.. Mind you it was ELEVEN AM. No way would we wait that long so we decided to just get another room in any floor. BIGGEST MISTAKE! The front desk told us we would get a strip view for the inconvenience on the 9th floor. We were excited to go check out the room and when we go in the view of the strip was non existen we had a wonderful view of the roof of the top of the casino.. 1 star down..

I tried to be open minded and not let that bother me.. But then I go use the restroom and the door gets jammed! I yelled for my mother in law to go help me open it because I was literally stuck inside the bathroom. It took about 5 mins to finally be able to open it . She had to push the door open with her whole body..Another star down..

We go down to the pool to tan and relax for a bit. They do have a small pool and even smaller jacuzzi.  A lazy river. And a wave pool. We walked around and it was beyond crowded you had to search for any empty chairs. The water was so nasty and hazy . I didn't dare to even go into the pool!

Bathroom lighting is horrible and the toilet flushing is so loud.. So night time rolls around and it's time for us to shower and get ready so I let my mother in law shower first. When she's done showering she tells me I might have to wait to shower because the tub is full of water.. The drainage was so bad it took forever for the water to go down. So we ran late to dinner because of this . Minus another star.

The pillows are not comfortable at all! They are so hard I even had to sleep with no pillows since it was unbearable.  On the other side of my bed there was also a big wet stain. Of course I didn't realize it until I stepped on it with my bare feet. I will never know what that was..

At this point I wish yelp had an option to put zero stars.. I won't ever be staying here again.

Mind you I'm in my early 40s so I'm not the twenty something all wild and crazy in Vegas but Monte Carlo is a snooze fest. Stayed here on a MLife offer for a comp night Sun - Thurs. Paid for a Sat & Sun and got a Monday night free. Got a standard two queen bed room on the 8th floor. Definitely a ""beige"" room. NOTHING has changed in these standard rooms since I stayed here in 1998 and 2008. Oh, except for the resort fees of which I get nothing out of them experiencing a terrible headache when I have to pay them. Come on get with the times Monte Carlo and get wi-fi all throughout the hotel and casino! Who uses a wired internet connection anymore? This is a beige and brown, bland, boring hotel. There's just nothing special here. There is a flat screen tv in the room with no hi-def signal. It is pitiful! The tv looks terrible but who's in their room watching it anyway I guess. Just wanted to watch a little NFL football on a Sunday morning while getting ready though. The furniture in the room is so old and scratched in the room you would think you were staying in a bad, cheap motel. The room decor has not changed since it was built. I think that goes for the beds and mattresses too. Ours was not comfy, it sagged. The mattress looked and felt like it was worn out and needed to be replaced. However, if you stay at Hotel 32, which is on the high floors that were renovated with insurance monies from the fire a few years ago, that is now a resort within a resort and those rooms have wi-fi and are much nicer. Bottom line, inside of the hotel needs a thorough renovation to modernize. The rooms need complete remodel and updates asap plus wi-fi added throughout the entire hotel. If you read more reviews, they say the same thing about no wi-fi throughout the entire hotel, it's only in the lobby. Despite what you think casino management, people gamble while on their smartphones on Facebook, Twitter, texting and Yelping of course!! Plus, people will stay sitting at slots longer because they are digitally connected and can get in touch with friends and family via electronics. Ha, maybe tell them to come and sit by them and gamble with them!

Yeah, Monte Carlo has the Blue Man Group, the Ice Bar, The Pub and a steak house but if you don't go to them, then there's nothing else. Tried to go to The Pub to watch NFL on a Sunday but it was packed. Servers said you have to get there really early for a spot. The pool is shaded most of the day and everyone crowds into the littlest sunny spot in the earlier part of the day.

Mold around the tub and shower in the bathroom was just plain gross. I just don't see how it is that much work for maintenance to remove the sealant around the sides of the tub and shower that is moldy and apply new sealant. It is so gross to look at it, none the less, shower in it. The shower head is terrible. My 6'3"" husband has to duck a mile to wash his hair. It's like they placed the shower head in a spot on the wall for growing adolescents. Plus, of course there is no water pressure because they are using water saving faucets and shower heads. 

I redeemed rewards from Facebook myVegas slots for a buffet of buy one get one free at the Monte Carlo buffet. I would not eat at the Monte Carlo buffet again. There's a reason you've never heard of the Monte Carlo Buffet before. It was not good. Not even worth the coupon. I would spend my time and money going to a higher quality buffet in the future. Even Harrah's buffet is better. I cannot remember one item of food that I consumed that had any real taste. Everything was bland.

The only good things for Monte Carlo Resort and Casino are that check-in was fast, no cab line (I wonder why? not many guests staying there?), lots of elevators to room towers so no wait for elevators, Diablos out front is pretty fun late night for some people watching, Ignite Lounge up front has some pretty good specialty drinks, staff are friendly for the most part, and housekeeping seemed pretty good. If you like coffee there is a Keurig in the room but I didn't use it. If I would've known maybe I would've brought a flavored coffee k-cup with me but I wasn't interested in the plain black stuff. No fridge in the room if anyone is wondering.

If you're looking for a very basic, value property in Vegas with no frills, no pizazz, no glitz, then Monte Carlo may be for you. It's just too blah for me and I can't handle the mold in the shower.

also, there's a tram (for FREE) that takes you to the Bellagio!

the pool was really cool. they have a lazy-river! i rented an inner-tube ($10 each) for a day. be careful! there were many ppl trying to steal other's inner tubes! it only cost $10 people!

all rooms in my opinion, should have a mini-fridge and microwave. i was told it would cost $30 for a mini-fridge! because i got a ""deluxe"" room, and they had to downgrade me because i wanted a smoking room, i was able to get the mini-fridge comped. that was pretty cool. 

the ""view"" of the strip, was o-kay. got room service for breakfast one morning. that was fun. i agree with some other people, the shower head was ridiculous! seemed hard to get any water pressure out. the shower head looks fancy, but doesn't do anything.

First of all, my room was comped, courtesy of the MyVegas app. Paid the resort fee and tax, and had myself a room for about $50 when all was said and done.

For the price, this place is pretty outstanding. As a person who won't spend Bellagio prices on a room in Vegas, this is one of the nicer hotels I've stayed in. The hotel features a respectable amount of artwork everywhere, lending to it's visual appeal. Every single hallway is lined with original artwork. I stopped to look at dozens of them and never saw the same painting twice. Best of all, there are many sculptures on the property as well. Not quite as large and ornate as you might see at Caesar's Palace, but quite respectable given the price range.

The casino is pretty standard, with a good selection of slots and tables games, and even a small poker room. They do feature $5 blackjack, which was a plus. And hanging above all the tables are these large, expensive-looking chandeliers - a nice touch. Furthermore, if you aren't gambling, there are still plenty of places to get cheap drinks! One of the bars had $4 pints of Shock Top and Sierra Nevada. Not bad. 

Now we come to the room. Again, for the price, it was rather impressive. Even more artwork was to be found in our standard, 2-queen room. We did not upgrade to the strip view, but still had a very nice view of the Aria, the Cosmopolitan, and even a glimpse at the Mirage and TI. A lovely view, only slightly dulled by the dirty window, and the construction going on way down below. The bathroom featured very nice tile in the shower. And all the fixtures and accents had a matching gold trim. Only complaint about the room would be that the mattresses were pretty saggy. I still slept soundly, however.

The Monte Carlo, like all MGM Hotels on the strip, DOES charge you for parking, even if you're staying at the hotel. Pretty lame, but the that's how things seem to be on the strip these days. There's still a few hotels that do offer free parking, Closest would be the Tropicana. We parked there, and it was a pretty long 15 minute walk with our bags.

I went to Vegas for a quick overnight trip and needed a room for one night.  The location is great because it is on the strip, next to Citycenter and my friends were staying here as well.  Outside of that, this place blows more than the girls pictured on the flyers handed out on Las Vegas Blvd.  Even though I only paid $79 for the room, I know I paid too much.  

The rooms are old and need a major updating.  They still have cathode ray tube televisions in the rooms.  The rooms are clean and seem to have new bedding but it still doesn't help.  

The hotel\/casino is only a little better.  A little more up-to-date but there's a smell that you can't get away from.  At first, we thought it was some lady going nuts on the cheap perfume and we happened to be trailing her but it was there everytime we walked in and out of the gambling area.  We concluded that it was some perfume\/scent pumped in to mask what ever smell was going on at this place.  

The dealers are\/seemed so unhappy working here.  They were just counting the minutes until death showed up or maybe a paper cut from one of the cards they were dealing so that they can go on disability and not have to be at the entry way to purgatory.  No smiles, no personalities, just a blank stare at you with emptiness inside of them.  Sad.  

The customer's here are a ""little rough around the edges"" is the best way to describe it.  They look like they could be locals who usually gamble in downtown but wanted to upscale it for the night. 

Never again will I stay in this place regardless of my friends.  Should have trusted my gut and booked a room at Vdara, Aria or the Mandarin Oriental since they were right next door.  We wound up gambling at the Aria casino anyway.  Uggghhh....",3,3,1

All is well.. until the day of our check out... so before leaving Vegas.. we had a branch at the buffet. 
Then my father in law need to use the restroom which located outside the buffet so.. he went out to use the restroom, and never get back to us so we finished our food and saw him in front of the buffet with a security... I thought they're just talking.. not until I saw my father in law showed his ID to the security guy.. so I was like.. umh the'res something wrong.... my husband asked what's going on... and the security said."" HE'S NOT WELCOME HERE. HE'S UNDER surveillance"" .they want to escort my dad to leave tbe hotel..  How could someone get under surveillance when he just got out from a buffet?????

I had packed up all my stuff (keep in mind that it's 2+ weeks if stuff) and trek down to the lobby with all my stuff, get onto a different elevator to head to the replacement room - which despite the inconvenience was NOT an upgrade.  The bed in the new room was beyond saggy in the middle as well as squeeky. There were also crumbs all over the floor. So they moved me to yet ANOTHER room. The room still wasn't an upgrade to either rooms. Now, at 9:45 pm I have to unpack - again, get some sleep and be up at 5:30 to get ready for work. Completely exhausted, frustrated and pissed.

We went to breakfast and were hoping the noise would be gone by the time we returned to our room. The noise was worse when we got back. I was scheduled for a late check out at 6pm with a fee of $60, which I was ok with... until I realized I would be sitting in a room with vibrating walls due to something that sounded like a jackhammer above me. I called guest services to see if they would waive the $60 because I had no choice to stay (my flight was later) and I needed to get work done. I was on hold for 22 minutes!!! I timed it... it was 22 minutes. Finally, when someone answered they said they could give me a late checkout for $30. You would think they would have said something like ""sorry we didn't inform you construction was inside"" or would just waive the $60 without question because they had to know seriously how loud this was. So, after 10 minutes they agreed to waive the $60. Absolutely horrendous to say the least. If you choose to stay here, expect incredibly loud construction INSIDE and OUTSIDE.

I contacted the front desk and did not receive an apology, empathy or any reaction that led me believe they were sorry or even cared about the mistake. I was told, ""your card will be credited. This will take between 3-9 days. Is there anything else I can do for you""?

It is probably the best balance of price and comfort available on the strip. It also offers an extremely high convenience factor when compared to other strip casinos. I'll explain.

1. There's a CVS right next door. In a town like Vegas, spontaneous supplies such as sunscreen, sunglasses, water, and Plan B may become crucial to a successful trip. When you stay at the Monte Carlo, your 24 hour CVS is just a quick walk away.

2. There's a tram to Aria and Bellagio. If walking is starting to get to you, this tram is your answer. It comes often and quickly whisks you a few hotels north so you can save your walking energy for later. This is especially useful if you need to get to the Bellagio quickly to give someone Plan B or money you owe them.

3. You aren't going to be killed by mobs when you walk around. The Monte Carlo is one of the smaller casino resorts and, as a result, doesn't draw a million people who just sit around and gawk at the craziness of the building. If you end up here with a woman screaming at you about some unplanned pregnancy, you're not going to draw nearly the number of stares that you would at the Venetian. 

4. The walk from your room to the outside world is very fast. This can be compared to the MGM Grand, where the walk from your room to the strip will take 2 days each way, which is hard when you're dragging someone somewhere while they are trying to make a scene.

Oh yeah, internet access is included with your room...but you have to use an ethernet cable because the year is 2003.",9,16,1

After pressing the attendant call button and flagging down a cocktail waitress, eventually a nice old man came and apologized, and handed me my cash right away.

I'm giving it two stars instead of one because on the way out, we saw a sign explaining that they were experiencing network issues with the slot machines, so I appreciate their candidness.

Our room was clean and we were well taken care of at the hotel. We used the pool area one day and were very pleased with the service poolside as well as the pool area itself.

Also didn't like that while the person was doing my pedicure, she was chatting about the days activities with a co-worker doing someone elses nails.

The only bad thing about our stay, was that the night we arrived, it was late and our flight had been delayed. After finally getting our rental car and getting over to the hotel and checked in, we were thristy and hungry. We headed over to the bar area where they generally serve food as well.  Apparently we got there, just as food service was cut off (it was like 11pm on a Thursday). Everyone had ordered drinks already before finding out there was no food to be had here.  Since I was 6 mos preggo at the time and starving, we asked if we could go get McDonalds (which they have at this  food court thingy right next to this bar area) and eat that with the drinks that had been ordered. I couldn't believe they wouldn't let us! I could totally understand that if they were serving food still...I wouldn't have even asked.  But with all the tourists and the liklihood of delayed flights and such, I think they should have accomdated us.

It is massive, beautiful, and clean. Wish I could've experienced the pool, which looked beautiful from the top. I hear they have great pool parties. 

The lobby is humongous, I felt like I walked miles just to get to the elevator. The casino was dead at the time that we rolled in. Looked like a typical casino, slots, slots, slots.

The room was spacious, bright, minimal, and clean. The beds and pillows were so comfy, just what the doctor ordered to sleep off a hangover.

Loved that the windows could be opened a bit even though we were high up. Most hotels do not have windows that can be opened on higher floors. Leaving only the choice of the AC, which I am not a big fan of. Having the window open came with a price... Very loud music disturbing the peace from 7am until 9am.

We arrived and had a hard time locating the self-parking section. We looked for signs and only after driving through the Valet section of the Hotel did we see the self-parking parking structure. 

As we pulled into the parking structure we observed a Security Guard in a 'Yellow' shirt driving around on a mountain bike. This helped our State of mind about leaving our suitcases and dry cleaning in the vehicle while we were inside the Casino for several hours, prior to walking away from out vehicle my girlfriend and I pulled a 'surfer' changing outfit routine inside of our vehicle. My girlfriend did not find it as amusing that as cars drove by I was pointing at her, it was funny and no harm no foul because they just thought I was a lunatic pointing at our car, my girlfriend was blocked by car doors. 

We parked on the 2nd level and found a tunnel\/bridge that leads directly into the Casino. As soon as we walked into the Casino I asked the first employee I laid eyes on 'Where is the Blue Man Group Theater.' The employee was super helpful and directed us in the right direction. 

As for the Casino itself it was a little bit too commercialized for my taste. As I have stated before I am more of the type of person that wants to kick it 'Old School' in Downtown Las Vegas. I tend to gravitate toward the closer surroundings of a Casino. I want to feel the energy while gambling instead of walking a maze of slot machines & roulette tables to get to a bathroom. 

I will be kicking myself in the butt because in the process of walking to the bathroom I said to myself put $20.00 on '24' on Roulette, I didn't and of course what hit but '24' dang you!!!!!!! 

We did enjoy our time inside the Monte Carlo but I cannot imagine a situation where I would ever come back here to gamble. I would without question come back to see the Blue Man Group again, that was an awesome show and I applaud the Monte Carlo for bringing a show like this to their Hotel & Casino.

The casino is ok. Pool was open (November) but the lazy river & what looked like a wave pool were drained & under construction. 

The only negative I can think of is the elevator system. The hotel rooms are separated into three sections, each with its own elevator: floors 1-12, 13-20, 20-35 (something like that). Our room was on the 11th floor & our friends were on the 18th floor. The only way to get to their room was to take our elevator down to the first floor & take their elevator up to the 18th floor because our elevator only went to the 12th floor. besides that, it's a great hotel.

I stayed at the Monte Carlo because my room was comped, and I'm glad to see that there were some improvements made since my last stay.

Check In

Check in was a breeze.  I arrived at the hotel at around 8AM because I flew in on a red-eye flight from the east coast.  When I arrived at the check in counter, the agent informed me the room hadn't been ready, however would contact me when the room was ready.  I felt that the service was personable.  The room was eventually ready by 11AM.

Bell Hop

Very friendly service.  Stored my bags in the back, and my laptop in their locker.  Felt very secure and safe that my personal belongings would be kept in a safe area.

The Room

OK, so this hotel can't be compared to some of the other newer properties for obvious reasons, but really, how much time do you spend in your room?  Do you actually take time to observe and nip pick on the decor?  You gotta be kidding me...you are in your hotel to pass out from partying, and wake up with a hangover....duhhhhh!  The room was fine--no frills, no fancy stuff....serves its purposes with beds and a shower.  It was fine for us.

The Casino

Man, this casino was hoppin' like no other.  My friends and I won a ton of money here---craps, blackjack, and slots.  For some crazy reason, it was paying out like crazy, and I don't regret it at all.  

Overall

I don't hate or love it.  It's a hotel right on the strip, and you can't beat its location.  Sure, if I had a little more money, I'd probably stay in a higher end property, but the bottom line is that it served our purposes--a place to sleep at the end of the night and I can't complain about that for sure.

2. This is subjective but the bed was extremely uncomfortable. Staying up till dawn and waking up at 10am because your back hurts isn't very Las Vegassy.

3. I requested an upgrade to a jr. suite and was quoted a what I thought was reasonable price upon check in. At check out, the price had gone up and it turned out that the front desk check in guy had lied to me.

4. The ridiculous $10\/day charge for the tepid bottles of water they have available in your room, the newspaper I never received and the gym that I could care less about. 

5. The fact that they don't tell you about this charge until you check out (then point to the .01 sized font and say ""its there in the small font that no one ever reads"")

When looking to book a hotel in Vegas, we were all on a bit of a budget and wanted to find a fairly affordable place to stay on the Strip without sacrificing too much by way of quality and comfort. The Monte Carlo came up on the radar, sounded good, so we decided to book 3 nights here. All things considered, we were not disappointed.

I booked through a 3rd-party site, which may have been a mistake, really, because they didn't disclose certain fees and policies in place at the Monte Carlo. So, at the time of check-in, I wasn't aware of the $20\/night 'resort fee,' among other things. It left me feeling a bit 'irked' at the check-in counter, but it wasn't the fault of the hotel so much as the website I used to book, so I can't fault them for that. The check-in woman was very nice and helpful. The two rooms we initially received didn't meet with my expectations, but upon calling the front desk, they quickly transferred I and my friends to two adjacent rooms on a higher floor, which were much better.

Our stay here was fine - not super-memorable or anything, but pleasant and excellent for the price and location. The valet service was prompt, the staff friendly, the housekeeping service efficient and the casino floor & restaurants clean and not overly-crowded or smokey.

The foyer where you wait for check-in is quite nice looking.  It makes you feel like you're staying at a really nice place.  That's about the only nice part of the hotel that I can remember...

Rooms = Our room was at the end of the hall, right next to the fire alarm exit door.  Standard 2 queen room that had a leaky tub faucet.  I thought the room was bland (nothing special about it at all), the window had a hand print, and I swear to you I want to say I saw blood on the walls.  I already felt dirty.  I don't like outdated, non-decorated rooms... I felt like I was staying at one of those INNs or Motels.

I will say that if you're drunk, hungry, and like Mc Donalds... you're in luck.  There's a food court downstairs.  I don't remember what time they are open till, but I do remember being there at one point.  

The hallways are kind of creepy, but that may have just been me.  There was this one time I was leading everyone back to the room... I slid in my room card, but the light kept flashing red.  I knew that we were the very last room next to the fire exit door, but when I looked at the room number it was different - like the numbers had moved around.  I seriously felt like I was in an episode of the Twilight Zone and started freaking out, hahaha... (mind you... yes, I was not sober - just imagine how you would feel).  That's when my friends realized we had just walked down the wrong hallway - each hallway looked exactly the same.

Yes, the rates are cheaper than other hotels on the strip, but my experience here wasn't up to my standards.  I would possibly give Monte Carlo another try if I was on a super tight budget, other than that... the room they gave me was no bueno.",1,0,0

I wasn't too jazzed when I was told where we were staying but having actually never stayed at the Monte Carlo I thought I'd just give it a chance. Well I was not impressed. The room space is small and dark, the furniture a little outdated with definite indications of  wear, the curtains didn't close completely as the curtain was missing pin hooks. The sheer curtain had a hole in it, the bed sheets were clean but had stains. Even though the room was on the 22nd floor, I could still smell smoke. Perhaps I was on a floor that had smoking and non smoking rooms because at times it smelled like it was fresh cigarette smoke. I think the walls are pretty thin too because I could hear the obnoxious neighbors at all hours. And while I recognize that a lot of people come to Vegas to party, it would be nice it they practiced some common courtesy and consideration for those who are trying to sleep.

My husband and I come to Vegas every couple of months for some relaxation and gambling. This is not a place I would return to stay. I might come back to the casino on another trip because the dealers were pleasant but as far as I'm concerned this is NOT a 4 star hotel so I would not stay here again.

Like others mentioned I was annoyed at the lack of a fridge in the room. I've been to worse hotels that had pubic hairs in the sheets, lipstick\/makeup streaks on the pillow case, gross stains on the floor etc but those rooms had a fridge. I drink a lot of water and we usually stock our hotel room fridge with bottled water b\/c I drink before I sleep, in the middle of the night and first thing in the morning. And drinking room temperature bottled water doesn't necessarily sound too refreshing.
Also we had to bring our laptop so the fiance could monitor his work email periodically but for $12.99 daily rate, a wireless connection was not provided. Instead you had to attach your laptop to this short tether of a cable cord. 
We opted for this rather economic ""resort"" nicely located on the strip rather than stay the higher rated Wynn. I'm thinking, OK this is Vegas. We're not here to lounge all day in a nice hotel. We only need it for sleeping, showering, and to hold our stuff\/luggage. Other than that, we were going to be out.

Let's put it this way. On a normal day you would stay here and think it's fantastic. However, if you have stayed in other flashier hotels in Vegas with bigger rooms, then you will think this place is crap. 

It is a little outdated, but the rooms are still large enough and the service is top notch. We came to Las Vegas last minute and didn't want to spend $300 bucks a night, so we stayed here.

The woman who helped me at the front desk was such a delight - super sweet, even comped the $30 early check in fee (without my asking) and got us a room higher up with a great view of the T-Mobile Arena. 

As for the room itself: don't come here if you're looking for luxury bells and whistles. Like previous reviewers mentioned, things desperately need updating. However, we weren't planning on spending much time in the room and our main priority was cleanliness. Speaking of, our room was cleaned to perfection every single day; no easy feat with 3 messy women sharing a bathroom! I was sure to leave housekeeping a nice tip for their effort!

We spent a lot of our free time by the pool, which we enjoyed. A word of caution: reserve your lounger in advance, otherwise you'll be stuck in the shade most of the day, if you even get a chair at all. It gets really busy! I feel like there are other hotels with much larger pools, but we only used the lazy river to cool off and that was enough to keep us happy.

Be SURE to check out Sambalatte downstairs - the most incredible coffee! We enjoyed a latte every single morning, and all agreed we were sad to leave solely because of this place, lol.

And that is when I'm going to call you a n00b.  Because let's review what one does when one come to Vegas: drink, gamble, shop, eat, and do inappropriate things that you can't get away with in your dinky little hometown.  Notice that none of those items include ""sleep"" or ""bed"" (not even doing the inappropriate things.  If you're doing it right, it'll be out in public with a cop on the verge of arresting you.  Heh.  I kid.  Sort of.).  So why blow all that money on staying in the Bellagio (BTW, the non-suite rooms are pretty tiny), when you're only go to use it to pass out?

Now that that's been covered, here's why the Monte Carlo rocks my socks:

1) It has a great location!  Centrally located across from MGM and Luxor, right on the Strip.

2) Rooms are big and roomy and very clean.  Not overly imaginative in the decor, but hey, I didn't come to Vegas to spend all my time in a hotel room (see paragraph 2 of this review)!

3) Not overly themey.  Don't get me wrong, I love all the theme hotels - I can spend hours in the Venetian or the Bellagio walking through their lobbies and shops, but I don't like to stay there, because I don't want to deal with annoying tourists (yes, I know I'm one too) while trying to get back to my room to pass out from drinking waaaaay too much.

4) The staff is generally very nice.  Each time I've come, I've asked for a room with a view of the Strip and each time, the front desk is able to accomodate me without giving me dirty looks or hem and haw over prices or any other nonsense.

5) There is a GREAT diner in this hotel, which seems like the lamest thing to be excited about...except when you've been awak for 26 hours and realized that you haven't eaten a bite for 20 of those hours, and you're on the verge of passing out but you need to get some food in you before you do, or you may die and never awaken.

6) It's connected to the Tram that will take you over to the Luxor and all that.  The Deus bus stop is right out front.  Yes, I hate walking so this really matters a lot to me.

7) The price!  Even before I start hitting up all the discount price sites for steals and deals, the rooms are usually around $60 - $100\/ night.  After I start searching for deals, I can usually snag the room for about $39\/night.  Um, HECK YEAH!  Especially considering where it's located!",14,5,9

I think people miss the point about the Monte Carlo.  Sure there's no attractions and it's kind of boring.  But, because of that, no one wants to stay there, it's rarely sold out, and they are forced to keep rates low.  It is right in the middle of the action on the strip, and the next step down in hotel is a pretty steep drop off.

The Monte Carlo is clean, modern, safe, centrally located, and has a decent array of dining options, just like its better-known siblings.  It is more of an adult hotel due to the lack of attractions for kids.  It has no interesting gimmicks like surrounding hotels but that's why you go visit them--you don't have to pay $400+\/night to the Bellagio to enjoy the grounds.  

If rates are the same, I would pick another more interesting hotel, but the Monte Carlo is usually a better value and the last hotel available before you start getting into casinos that have 60-year-old chain-smoking cocktail waitresses named Trudy waddling around providing visuals you could have done without.",3,3,0

This is probably the easiest way to handle this review:
ROOM -
The first night we got stuck with two queens vs. a king. BOO.  Second night we were graciously moved to a better room.  The problem is that there are about 5 buildings going up around the hotel at the same time.  So LOTS of construction noise, even on the 26th floor.  
The bathroom was ok but no vent and shower did not drain well.  I liked that they have that shower curtain that doesn't stick to you and the toiletries that come in the room are very good quality (surprising!).  The room view was cool cause we were up so high, but the damn Lane Burton do not disturb sign would NOT stay on the door!!
The queen beds were super bad but the king was comfortable.  Overall I would stay here again.
THE POOL:
The bar is good.  You are gonna need a stiff drink to ignore the 5 buildings going up around the pool and blocking most of the sun.  I would recommend going in early afternoon to try to lay out.  Good luck.
There is a diving pool, wave pool, lazy river, huge hot tub, and then some weird unmarked and fenced off pool (for cabana use?  adults only?  who knows?)
Mostly the lack of sun was the issue here.  And the construction.  

CASINO:
This is a smaller casino but my friends won a bunch.  I signed up for their player's card and there are signs everywhere that state that for 500 points you get 25 bucks free play.
I try to cash in my 1000 points the last day and got FIVE dollars in free play.  What a rip off.  I felt gypped.
I didn't win SH*T.

There is a cool place called Diablo's attached to the casino with good food, upstairs view of strip and GREAT drinks.  Loved the Frida Khalo.  Highly recommend this place.

Monte Carlo at Vegas doesn't have a dog in that fight; it's a rather shining example of ""Well, there ya go."" What you see in photos is what you get. What you glean from the reviews of fellow Yelp-ers and Tripadvisors is, again, what you get: Prime location, B- ambience, amazingly comfortable beds, fitness center, large enough pool that one (namely me) can keep a safe distance from the vacant vocal-fry dialogue of drunk college girls, enough cuisinal offerings to satiate most palettes (unless you have a hankering for Maltese but only if the fenkata preparation is faithful to its historical origins, and if you are this douchebag, please go insert your head in an oven).

I can't vouch for the casino at Monte Carlo, though. I'm not a gambler on the basis that I wouldn't deposit the balance of my checking account into a wood chipper, so what makes an illuminated box with a lever any more sensible?

    The Good...we stayed in a newly renovated HP room on the 22nd floor. The rooms are much more modern than the past, there are new carpets in the halls + rooms, new paper, etc. The room was very good, clean and had ample space.
   The Bad...There are a LOT less machines and tables on the floor. It is very confusing to move around this place right now. In a few days, they will be closing 800 Degrees, the Double Barrel, the Saltimblatte cafe, and the Diablo Cantina place. The food court and small shops are totally gone. There are 2 places left to eat, a new high end steak house, and a smaller ""wanna' be""  French type restaurant. Neither are really good in my opinion, and both are expensive. There is no place for breakfast, zippo, nada, nil. There is ONE set of bathrooms, so you can expect to walk about 100 yards from wherever you are on the floor...maybe more. The pool is gone, but you are welcome to use their other pools, if you don't mind walking about 3\/4 of a mile in your bathing suit, across Las Vegas Boulevard to wherever. They won't take anything off your bill for this, I mean...Hey...it's Vegas you know!
   The Ugly...construction and workers are ongoing everywhere here. It's extremely noisy outside, the dust outside will cover your car in a day. There's dust inside too, just look at the small lights over the elevators to see what you will be breathing. Entering from the garage, at the top of the escalator, it smells like a toilet. Like methane or people peeing on the walls, I don't know what the smell is, it's gross! In the lobby there's a giant tree trunk, root piece of crap on the ceiling. No clue how that is upscale! Inside the elevators the carpet is still old. The elevators are still 50 or 60 years old and slow. Where the shops and food court was, it's...construction, like it was LAST YEAR. We grow tired of it and probably are not going to return here again.
   One interesting note for slot players. We played about 1K a day, I was kind of racking up points and my GF wasn't. Naturally, we didn't win any money, but...Hey...it's Vegas, we planned to spend and lose, that was the plan, really. Anyways, my GF likes to play the big flashy, progressive machines like the Wonka deal. I noticed those machines had a tiny plaque saying they were ""specialty"" games. The next day we went to the rewards window and asked about that. It seems regular games earn 1 point for about 3 dollars in. The ""specialty"" games win 1 point for $10.00 in. We never heard of that, I've been gambling for about 25 years.
   The truth is, we live an hour from Mohegan + Foxwoods, and go there a lot. There are like 20 restaurants in each, countless shops + machines. Want dessert? No problem. Want to dine? No problem. Want to eat cheap? No problem. Want Asian, Italian, Mexican, American, breakfast, or whatever food? No problem. This place and Vegas are not really as appealing as they used to be !!!",0,0,0

We scored a daybed on a Thursday, because we thought the deal was a steal. $200 for a private area, and you can spend that $200 on food and drink? Perfect. 

We show up at 9:00, and the $200 daybeds were situated in the shade. We asked the attendant when we could expect some sun, and she told us ""not until 2:00 or 3:00""

Hang on a second. I am from the midwest. I haven't seen sun in 7 months. I want some sunshine. She told us that we could upgrade for another $125...so we did. We wound up in the red daybeds situated by the lazy river, which was pretty perfect. The private area is choice. 

We started off with pina coladas and muffins for breakfast, and everything was off to an awesome start. The sun appeared over the hotel at about 10:00, and we basked our pale asses off. 

Then things kind of went downhill. We had $325 to spend on food and drink, which seemed manageable...but the food is AWFUL. Everything is heavy, greasy, and not what you want to eat poolside. The chicken fajita nachos and artichoke and spinach dip were our first tries, and we barely touched them. The other lunch options sounded even heavier, so we opted out. Sitting in 90 temperatures, I do not want a giant beef sandwich, or a large greasy burger. Blech. The folks in the daybed next to us said their flatbread pizzas were pretty soggy and gross.

The fruit plate was decent. So...order thirty of those?

When all was said and done, we wound up ordering a bunch of beer to bring back to the hotel, which is cool that they let you do. The bill with all of the service and included gratuity was $422. It was a nice experience, but not a $422 experience. So minus one star for the crappy food and price, and minus another star for not including the fact that the $200 daybeds will be in the shade almost all day on the website.",1,1,0

The hotel is a bit dated, No amenities in the room like a coffee maker or mini fridge.  Mattress was just ok, my back didn't hurt but I was happy to get out of bed in the morning.  Our shower was a little funky, it leaked from the faucet and it was hard to get the heat adjusted. Like many big casino hotels, our room was pretty far from the elevator and it was on the 31st floor so it takes a while to get anywhere. I felt like I was out on the south forty. 
Despite all this I would stay again, the price was right and the kids liked the pool area. The tram to the Bellagio is nice and very convenient.

""Vegas Gives You a Handjob and then Bakes You Cookies (But Only After Vegas Washes Its Hands First.)""  It all looks so glamorous, so sparkly. Neon dreams washing over doe-eyed faces; the visuals alone are worth the price of admission. 

What no one ever mentions, though, are....the smells. Perfume, cigarettes, urine, Axe Body Spray, cigarettes...um, what is that? Chinese food? Oh, and the cigarettes. Each hotel and casino has its own scent, depending on its age and clientele. Binions, downtown, smelled of menthols and Ben Gay. Traces of suntan lotion, Axe Body Spray and Pall Malls wafted through the Excalibur while the Imperial Palace reeked of Virginia Slims and despair.

This brings me to the Monte Carlo. The Monte Carlo is a middle-range hotel, by Strip standards. While not as dismal as that time I stayed at The IP (Room 13, natch), it's not as high-end as Aria or the Bellagio or wherever George Clooney goes to get his penis washed. However, Monte Carlo's location is nice. It's centrally located (relatively speaking) and the free tram to Aria and the Bellagio is a big help for weary footsies.

And the smell?  It was somewhere between Windex and Marlboro Reds. Actually, no. It leaned more towards the Marlboro Reds, especially in my room. Yeah, we requested a non-smoking room, but it still smelled like 1967 in there. We should've immediately requested another room, but after quickly dropping off our bags and then going full tilt that first day, it wasn't until the Day One Vegas buzz wore off that we noticed that we had just bunked up Joe Camel's asshole. The smoke permeated everything, from the sheets to the towels.

We lived with it. The wife scored a candle from a friend and that helped. 

Other than that, the room was ok. It was nothing special, but nothing horrible either. The wave pool was empty, which disappointed us a bit. The ""lazy river"" looked uninspired from our perch waiting for the Bellagio tram, though admittedly, we didn't look closer than that. The check-in clerk was adorably perky and helpful. The price wasn't bad either. Oh and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the showerhead. That thing was like being pressure washed every morning which, for most people vacationing in Las Vegas, is probably necessary. It sounds like I'm complaining about the showerhead, but I'm not. The showerhead was easily one of my top three favorite things about Las Vegas and that includes my outrageously expensive meal at Jose Andres' e'. In all, I would've given the Monte Carlo 4 stars were it but for the smoke.

Damn you, you smokers. This is why we can't have nice things.",11,17,10

The pool area is gorgeous, relaxing and has lots of shade available if you're not one to sit in the sun all day.  Lazy River is a perfect way to end your day relaxing and enjoying a cocktail before heading out for the night.  The Pub inside the hotel is a great place for a casual dinner with upscale feel.  And, let me tell you about the  Cupcake bakery!  My special-needs niece turned 21 and wanted to experience Vegas.  I went to the cupcake bakery and ordered 21 cupcakes to be delivered to us after dinner (at The Pub).  When they were delivered, I just about fell over!  They arranged the cupcakes in the number 21, placed candles on each one AND, included 4 exra cupcakes at no charge in a small 'to go' box for her to take back to her room.  And, they were so sweet to her, they stuck around to sing Happy Birthday!

I was able to negotiate traffic with ease.  Parking was tight but the garages are long so I was able to find a spot on the second floor.

Coming across the catwalk and into the casino, I instantly became lost and roamed around for awhile before finding the elevators. My bad at times I am to stubborn to read.

While on my walk I did look things over.  Even thought the Monte Carlo has been around awhile it still had a certain pop to it.

I thought it strange that there was not a security guard doing key checks at the elevators but I hopped right on.

Once I made it to the floor I saw just how long the hallways were.  I mean they seem really long in this place.  Depending on where your room is at it's a long walk to get ice.

The rooms were clean and felt comfortable.  It was a double bed but the room only had one chair.  I guess my only complaint was that they did not have NFL Network that could be played on the old school television set.

Let me first start off with the pros: very clean hotel, we had a pool view on the 20th floor, bathroom was huge in the room, room was clean, staff was very polite and helpful, casino was great, and they had amazing pools. They had a lazy river, a wave pool, a regular decent sized pool, a jacuzzi, and a little v.i.p pool with a little fence surrounding it with a private cabana inside. They had cabanas all through out the pool areas, but you had to reserve them. Had a couple of bars out by the pool, and had good music playing as well. 

Cons: the rooms didn't have any refrigerator, microwave, or coffee machines. The bathroom didn't have a fan in there, so I had to shower with the door opened.. The drain was very clogged and the shower head water kept going out if I put it on a comfy setting. In the middle of the casino, there was a very foul odor almost like a sewage problem.. (it happens) at the pool, you can't bring alcohol inside the gates, so be aware! They have bars inside the gates, but, it's very pricey! In the casino, $4 for a bottle of water! As well as the little gift shop by the lobby area... Go through the casino, it leads you out to the strip, and go to the CVS next door to the hotel or go to Walgreens across the street! It's much cheaper! Also, at the casino, if you want your free alcoholic beverages, go a little earlier during the afternoon\/evening, or else you won't find barely to any servers after 7-7:30. So, you'll have to end up going to the CVS or Walgreens to buy alcohol. Unless you're there for the views and everything and not to drink!

Check in was easy-breezy.  No problems, and fairly quick.  We arrived there later in the evening and it was easy.  We also rented a scooter for my mother and the staff was so helpful in the pick up and drop off of the scooter.  Very nice and helpful as well.  

Getting to the elevators from the lobby was not too bad... You have to walk a little ways through the casino. The rooms were pretty good.  I wouldn't say they were the greatest rooms we've ever stayed in, but they had what we needed and they were clean.  

The Windows did allow quite a bit of sound into the room though.  There was a construction site next door, and we could hear the fairly constant beeping of the trucks.  I imagine once that was completed the rooms are probably pretty quiet now.  

The food court near the elevators gave our family plenty of options for meals in which everyone seemed to be pretty happy with the choices and selections.  My mom doesn't like to spend a lot of money on food when she travels, and she was fairly content.  

We enjoyed our stay and plan to stay again this spring.  I'll update with more info.",0,1,0

I'll tell you why this place is dead on the weekends -- there's no nightlife here. No big club or trendy restaurant. It's just a stopping point before starting your night. 

There are also quite a few kids here. Personally, I would never bring my kids (if I had any) to Vegas. That was such a 90s thing to do. Now, even Excalibur has ""The Thunder from Down Under"" which, I would like to point out, is definitely not kid friendly.

They offer a few different pools (lazy river, hot tub, regular pool and a wave pool) and an abundance of chairs to lay out on (grab two towels! those chairs get hot in that 109* sun).

Tsk Tsk Tsk.. no impressed. I'll start off with the Pros:
1-The location! muy bueno. you can walk to any popular spot or nightclub from this hotel 
2-The Tram: ok if you don't wanna walk (see#1), then you can take the tram that can take you from the Monte Carlo to the Aria Hotel to the Bellagio
3- the Pool: 3 different pools, one with waves!..... really mellow (except Saturday, it was poppin'!), really hot servers, and it  also has a volleyball court (not, that ur going to vegas for a pick up game of Volleyball, but just so u know)
4- ask for comp late checkout..you just might hit the jackpot and get it for frrrrreeeee!
5- not bad for the $$ BUT........

Once you enter the ""deluxe"" rooms with strip view:
(Cons):
1- the carpet in the room look outdated, old, somewhat dirty.
2- The ""Deluxe"" part of the deal for our room... i wasn't feelin' it. It felt like we were staying in a Motel 6. It had no fridge, not microwave, small bathroom
3- can't BYOD to the pool area
4- food court staff are rude, terrible, incompetent: (Starbucks: couldn't get the most basic, simple, easiest drink to prepare, right: a Chocolate milk. really!? Banana bread: bad.
Sbarros (sp): gave an incomplete order and when i made brought it up to them they were making a big deal as if I was trying to get a free meal...

This review is just for the rooms and the pool. We partied, ate, and did things elsewhere.

Monte Carlo was an okay Hotel to stay in. It is priced pretty decent, but the rooms are also just decent. We had 8 people sharing two rooms (with four beds total) and we got the two rooms with a connecting door. That makes communication very easy. But there is nothing fancy or special about the rooms. But you're in Vegas, so you're here to party (and\/or gamble). So the hotel\/room choice is not that big of a deal. 

We went there last late October, and around Monte Carlo, there were constructions going on. I don't remember (hahaha) the noise to be a problem. But I did find their vehicle loading\/unloading to be positioned in a wrong place. It's not at the front, but rather it's on the side where you have to go into their alleyway. 

Their pool area is nice and big, and they have plenty of seats. But the damn unfinished\/constructing building right there wasn't that appealing. (But that is probably not the fault of Monte Carlo.)

Next time, I would try somewhere else, so to see the other selections.",0,0,0

The location is prime, right in the middle of the strip, the center of amazing restaurants, bars and the beautiful new strip walk of Las Vegas.  You can literally walk out the front door and go either way, with New York , NY on one side and the Aria on the other, the Hard Rock and MGM Grand right across the street.

The pool area was a fun time, great atmosphere, a DJ playing, great bars and a we truly enjoyed lounging here for a few hours.  We stayed on the strip view side.  It was okay, but you see the top of the casino from this side, which wasn't too great of a sight because it was the roof, but still able to see across to the MGM, Polo Towers, etc.  The casino was pretty much just like all the other casinos, bars here and there, a buffet and a few good restaurants.  The Minus 5 bar is here, which we actually didn't try, but it is a nice edition if you want the experience.  
I did take a star away for the room.  It was run down looking and old, with tape holding up the desk drawer, which was broken and wouldn't stay shut.  Scratches on the wood furniture, cracks in the bathroom tile and a tile piece missing even.  I guess this is what I was expecting because we knew the hotel was older, but we weren't really going to Vegas to spend all day in a luxury room, we were going to Vegas to spend time outside of the room!  Upgrading a few things in the rooms would probably be a plus for this classic hotel, however, I wouldn't complain.

Serious problems with upkeep and cleanliness. The casino floor smells unclean, the pool chairs are DISGUSTINGLY dirty, I bought a mojito by the pool and it had a hair in it  the bathrooms need a new shower head, because the one now has no way of adjusting water pressure and it left my skin all red. The bathroom towels are so old and stiff 
Would not recommend this hotel unless as you read my review you feel this is an upgrade from your last hotel stay. 


Update- I showed pictures and expressed in detail my discontent  to Mr. Thomas Johnson, Management Associate- Hotel Operations. He was very apologetic. 
After several minutes of listening to my concerns he attempted to reach the pool area management via phone but was unsuccessful (they didn't pick up). Mr. Johnson walked over to the pool area and discussed the issues I reported. Mr.Johnson returned and reported he would credit me the resort fees (about $60.00) and that of the pool area bill (approx $60). Honestly it did make me walk away a bit less bitter.

Since Hyatt and MLife hava status match, and I'm Hyatt Diamond, I put a request in for the status match and booked two rooms here.

The lobby is decent here - not over the top but it's decently nice. I didn't see any sort of MLife Platinum check in (maybe I didn't look hard enough). When I got to the gate agent, it turns out my status match never went through. She told me to go to the MLife desk, but never told me that I should come back once I do the match. It's my understanding that I could have been upgraded rooms. Nope, they never even offered.

The rooms themselves were not bad, but pretty outdated. The hallways near it had carpet that looked like it was neglected. There were parts of the hotel that were like that really. The casino wasn't bad either. There's absolutely no perks for even breakfast for MLife Platinum members. Only higher bonuses and the VIP cab line. That's it - and that's kind of depressing.

I'd say ""I wouldn't recommend staying here"", which I wouldn't really unless you just need an OK room for a night or two but they're apparently going to renovate the entire place soon for the next 1.5 years. Would be interested to see what it looks like after.

I've paid much more for a comparable room at Caesars Palace, so I was happy here. I've outlined the pros and cons below. We just had a one-night stay (Thursday), but for $48 plus resort fee (MLife rate) it was worthwhile. The room was simple, but spacious. The furnishings were a bit dated and worn, but it was fine.  The hotel's branding calls it ""Unpretentiously Luxurious."" Depending on your perception of luxury, that is a pretty fair slogan.

On the meh side, the HD tv featured no HD channels. The shower is not well lit, but the bathroom was clean and functional. The check-in took about 30 minutes in  line and there were only 3 or 4 employees manning the desks, though there were stations for something like 15. If you are MLife gold or higher, look for the VIP services on the edge of the lobby toward the casino to check in.

We were upgraded to a Strip View room (27th floor of 32). The view of the Strip was minimal; you'll be mostly looking across to MGM Grand and Signature along with some of the lowest rent shops along the strip, or you'll be looking north at the towering Mandarin Oriental which blocks any view further up the Strip. I should have taken a photo to show you, but I didn't even think about it because it was so unremarkable. It was not a view worth paying for, but again, our upgrade was free. If this will be your first trip to Las Vegas and you really want a nice view of the Strip, look for another hotel.

My biggest complaint was that the people on our floor were loud in the hallways in the middle of the night. Yeah, it's Vegas, but have some decency. That's what I get for trying to stay on a cheap rate, I guess.

The best part was the pool. With a lazy river and a wave pool, you get a lot of options. The pool wasn't massive, but it needn't be. The water temperature was nice and the music was good. A DJ came in the afternoon and she mixed good songs but didn't become the center of attention of our afternoon at the pool.

The casino offers some $5 blackjack tables near the food court which is a nice option for the risk-averse or the parsimonious Yelper. Most of the other tables were $10 or $15, I think.

The Cafe was a good lunch spot for not too much coin. I had a nice ham and cheese sandwich with salt and vinegar chips and my wife enjoyed her meal, too. I can't remember what it was, but she liked it. Food here counts toward MLife points. It didn't seem to count at the Dragon Noodle house, but that was another good lunch option. The lunch specials are cheap but the food quality was much better than Panda Express.

Though the view in our room was meh, the hotel's location is good to many other hotels. You can catch the tram for a quick ride up to Bellagio if you're in the mood for something fancier.  With the cheap room rate and convenience to other hotels, this would be a good place to stay on the cheap if you want to spend your money on nice dinners and\/or shows. There are cheaper hotels in the MLife family, but they get really, really sketchy (Luxor, Excalibur). Mirage or Mandalay Bay would be a notch up from Monte Carlo.

Another random note: Monte Carlo is one of the easiest to access from Las Vegas Blvd. That is, the driveway is not as complicated. This was a good advantage for us because my brother (a local) picked us up when he got back into town for the weekend. Also, being on the south end of the Strip makes it a  pretty quick to\/from the airport.",8,0,0

Compared to other hotels on the Las Vegas Strip, the Monte Carlo has central access to elevators and attractions.  The rooms were well kept and clean.  They didn't have free Wi-Fi access but you could plug into an Ethernet cable if you need to access the Internet in your room.  The price for the room was reasonable as well.  However, a hotel room is really only for sleeping in Las Vegas.

They have a casino, of course, along with various restaurants, a small shopping corridor and the Blue Man Group.  If you have a chance to see the Blue Man Group, do it, because it's a fun and interactive show.  The Monte Carlo should be lucky that they are able to have this show at their casino.

We arrived at the Monte Carlo early but we decided to try to check in.  The first guy who helped us was nice and upgraded our room being that it was our anniversary and my husband's first time in Vegas.  He told us that our room wasn't quite ready yet but that the bell hop would hold our luggage and we would be receiving a text between 2 and 3 pm with our room number.  We walked over to the bell desk and the two attendants that were there completely ignored us.  The third one who helped us was rude and very short with us.  My husband even tried to make small talk but she wouldn't even glance up at us.  We went to lunch then walked around, we waited till 3:30 pm, 30mins after the front desk told us our room would be ready.  We decided to go back and the second guy we talked to was also extremely rude to us!   Then he proceeded to tell us that our room was still not ready.  I told him that the Monte Carlo's website said check in is at 3pm.  He corrected me and told me that, ""technically, check in is between 3 and 5 pm.""  It must be in the fine print.  Then he refused to honor the upgraded room the first front desk clerk gave us.  After seriously arguing with him he finally allowed the upgrade and then GUARANTEED us that our room would be ready by 5pm and that we would then receive a text.  So we left and wandered the casino.  At 5:20pm we still hadn't gotten the text that our room was ready, we were furious!!  We went back to the front desk and immediately asked to speak to the manager who then was going to down grade our room.  After arguing with the manager he finally got us into a room.  Mind you, we originally reserved a room with a king bed.  He put us in a double queen bed room.  We then had to call down the front desk again and switch rooms.  We were really upset that we were treated the way we were by so many of the hotel staff.  Even the casino waitresses were mean and rude.

There are some crappy things, but some bonus things about this place. Let's start with the bad. The check in counter, there's no single line. You just stand behind a person that's being helped. and everyone follows. So you can be outta luck if the person in front of you is taking FOREVER. the room. nothing fancy, but the beds and pillows were comfy, definite plus. The room though, omg...you can hear EVERYTHING. i mean ive been to hotels where the walls are thin, but because of the connector door, we could hear everything from the next room. Sunday morning, I could hear the football game's play by play going on next door. Ridiculous. The bathroom has no fan, so you can hear everything as well, and the toilet flusher makes a crazy loud noise. Overall, the room was whatevers, but at least the key thing was the beds and pillows were comfortable, but I just couldnt enjoy it with all the noises outside. Another negative thing is the elevators are quite slow, and don't seem to come and go as often. 

Casino is decent. I didn't imagine them to have such a big one, and some decent lounges and restaurants inside. However, if you play slots, cocktail waitresses DO NOT come around. And every single one I encountered (one time I had to walk around and find one myself) are all MEAN. Their M Life players club line...there's only one person tending to guests. I tried waiting in line 3 different times, and even with only one person in line, it took DAYS. i probably could've gotten a lot of points on my first day but with no card, no luck. 

The pool looks so janky, and they have a lazy river that my friend enjoyed the first 5 minutes. 

The best part is the food court, which is critical in any hotel. McDonalds, Sbarro, and Subway are open 24 hours, WAHOO! and the McDonald's has the $1 menu and mini meals, which is a definite plus. Pizza and fast food are the main staples of food after a hard night of drinking.

We got a suite and hoped for the best. 
The front desk service is great, the lobby is lovely. 
BUT the rooms are really run down!  The beds are SO lumpy!  The furniture has cracks in it, paint is peeling, glass is chipped.  
The couch in the suite looked like it was left over from an old 70's party and dropped off at the curb and the monte carlo thought it was a good idea to put it in their rooms.  Gross! 
The casino was TERRIBLE!!!  The smoke was SOOO bad and the dealers were some of the RUDEST I have ever ever ever dealt with.  They didnt laugh, they didnt talk and they would hush people and ask people to leave if they were too loud etc.  One lady told a guy to leave her table now!  And he was just trying to make conversation with him.
Dont even get me started on the Cocktail Waitresses.  They were all Grandma Moses and slower than molasses.  It took us 45 minutes to get ONE drink.  So we started ordering two at a time.

We've stayed here before and always got a great room with optimal service. This time around we get a danky hotel room that have walls that are way too thin.

* Tube TV. 
* No coffee in-room. 
* No sewing kit or shower cap.

We walked into Monte Carlo feeling great but it took us at least 30 mins just to check in... pretty ridiculous!

I give it 3 stars not for the room but for other things such as the location, ease of getting to other hotels, and the other hotel amenties.

The hotel room itself needed serious help. I have been on plenty of cruises and the toilet flush reminded me of a cruise boat... loud and noisy!

The bed was HARD and we were annoyed because we booked a king bed back in June and we came late August and had two beds! We had to wait until 3pm the next day to swap out. UGH! How annoying to drag all your stuff and move rooms.

The internet was free but no wireless which was annoying. I never use desks in hotels, especially in Vegas so they really need to look into having a password system or something!

The actual room amenties were yucky, the soap was hard, the water was hard coming out of the yucky shower head. The towels stunk and it was just all around not that great. Luckily for us we left the room more often than not.

The buffet was just okay. The food was just okay for brunch... they do have unlimited mimosas for $2 extra but it wasnt quite worth it to me. The crab was the best thing there.

Beware the $15 resort fee they charge you at checkout. Get what you can from it, use the pool! It was SO much fun with the DJ and I think they were having contests and things which was entertaining! 

The Brand Steakhouse night club was nice. You get hounded by so many people asking if you want to go, that we decided to check it out. Friday night was girls night I guess where everyone pays $20 cover but girls drink free. I love that you can exit and enter and come back after you gamble a bit. The music was great, a mix of hip hop and pop and house\/techno. We danced quite a bit and felt that the $20 was worth it!

The location was perfect! You can walk to New York New York and catch the tram all the way to Mandalay Bay or you can catch one to Aria and Crystals and Bellagio. You can walk basically to Ceasars without a cab or catch a cab and hit the other part of the strip.

The other reason we had reservations here was because the really good show Jabbawockeez was playing here so we only had to get dressed and go downstairs, PLUS!

We were so close to Planet Hollywood and the ABC store, UA theatre, Hard Rock and the little flea market to get little trinkets.

Overall the location is what you pay for so if you dont intend on sleeping, stay there!",1,0,0

This hotel is considered old and I think they should fix up the hotel rooms a bit. I do like the location of this hotel, even though it's located toward the south side of the strip, they have a monorail that will take you to Aria, City Center and Bellagio. In fact you can just walk to Aria without going outside. No need to worry about scorching hot weather or rainy seasons. 

If you want a decent room and good rate, I recommend this hotel. But do not think this is mirage status, it's one step lower. Don't even compare to bellagio or higher. 

If you don't care about fancy schmancy rooms, and your idea of a room is just a place to sleep, then Monte Carlo is a good stay. The pools are pretty nice: man made beach and lazy river. You will be close to the more popular clubs: hakkasan, marquee, etc.",0,0,1

My experience was stellar. We got a cheap room after the recent fire (hehe) and had no problems during the whole trip. Everyone was super friendly...and they didn't give us any shiz about cramming 5 people into a room with 2 queens.

The staff was even friendly when I stumbled in at 5am three nights in a row without a room key.

The food court with McDonald's, Sbarro, Subway, Rubio's, etc was perfect for us drunkies. 

Even the casino staff was really nice and taught us lots of random shiz as we were trying to get drunk for free at the nickel slots.

My only complaint is that they charge $12 to rent a tube for the lazy river! I just bought one at the store next to the pool for $10 and then used it all weekend.... weird.

Pros:
- Price for the night was $65, (though plus tax and that stupid resort fee it was $84), still not bad
- Right on the strip near NY NY, MGM Grand, etc, walking distance to everything 
- Nice italian wine bar and restaurant inside (D Vino)
- Very comfy beds
-They let us check in at 1pm (even though check in isnt supposed to be until 3pm)
-Free parking, nice parking garage
-Very easy to get to from the highway

Cons:
- Be wary of ""strip view"" rooms...since the casino is in front of the hotel, you can't see much if the strip except the taller big buildings. I didnt pay extra for that though, so it was nice. 
-No matter how you reserve the room, apparently they dont reserve specific room requests, like 2 queen or 1 king. so stupid!
- No free wifi. In fact it was like $16 for the day!
- The line to check in and check out is RIDICULOUS! you wait 10-20 minutes AT LEAST. 
-No fan in bathroom
-Pillows flat and not comfy
-Pool wasnt open obviously cuz we went in January, but no hot tubs either! ugh!
-Escalators werent working half the time (this was actually true all over Vegas)
-Old TV, remote wasnt working
-No wall light switches for lights in room except for one light in entry way
-We did not get our two ""free"" bottles of water

We stayed at the Monte Carlo because it was one of the cheaper hotels after the price kept going up for other hotels and the Monte Carlo still got relatively decent reviews and was in a decent location on the Strip and wasn't too far away from things we wanted to see.

We tried to check in a bit early because our flight was an early morning flight, meaning we arrived in Vegas in the early afternoon. However, instead of checking to see whether there was a room available, the Monte Carlo said there was a fee for early check-in. Therefore, we opted to stow our suitcases rather than pay the silly surcharge and we walked down to the Bobby's Burger Palace to get some lunch while we waited for our room to be ready. 

The shower head was very harsh, so much so I had to put it on half tub and half shower and it made a horrible moaning sound just so the water wouldn't hurt so much. 

Our room overlooked the park outside the T-Mobile Arena. When we arrived in our room, there was a notice explaining that there was a concert being held in the plaza. I missed the noise associated with the plaza concert because I attended a concert at the Caesar's Palace Colosseum that evening and the plaza concert outside the window was finished by the time I got back to the room, by my friend came back to the room earlier and said the concert in the plaza was quite loud. 

The morning before we had to checkout, we visited the pool. The pool area was nice, although the pool chairs were very tightly packed together. I really enjoyed the lazy river area. You had to pay to rent tubes, but we just floated in the lazy river without using the tubes and there was decent water pressure to get you around the lazy river area.

for the good deals, its worth staying here. we stayed in a standard the first 2 nights and had a spa suite the 3rd night. if you have a bunch of people and u can get the spa suite for a good deal, take it! theres a bar, a jacuzzi in the room, and a nice view! 

the people at the desk were always really nice and easy to talk to.. there were a few times when they forgot to bring us a bellman, or tried charging us 2 bucks for ranch when we got room service.. but its all good. 

i really didnt think it was a far walk from places on the strip.. and plus, it's nice to be at a particular location and explore things nearby more. we barely ever went to places near Wynn\/Circus Circus because it was far but we went to Tropicana, Hooters, the m&m store and what not. it was fun! i know i have lots of Vegas trips ahead of me so no big deal, ill explore all of it sooner or later. and plus i like walking!",1,1,1

Location: Great location close to the middle of the strip. The hotel has a free tram that connects to Aria and Bellagio, a major plus in the summer heat. Another plus is the huge parking structure and a dedicated street via Rue de Monte Carlo, accessible from LV Blvd. and Frank Sinatra, making it easy to get in\/out of the hotel.

Check In\/Out: Check in late Thursday night was a breeze, but I saw huge lines on subsequent days while passing through the lobby. The hotel was never too crowded and its layout is simple and easy to navigate, which was a big plus for me on a busy trip. The front desk was helpful with our requests, which included a room change and reservation change (from my girlfriend to me).

Rooms: Originally got a 5th floor room (which overlooked a generator) but were able to move up to a 19th floor strip view room our second day (19321). Rooms are middle of the road - I've stayed at better, I've stayed at worse. A little rough around the edges and a bit outdated, but the room was clean and the bed comfortable.

Amenities: Of what was covered by the $22 resort fee, we took advantage of the 2 bottles of water and internet, which was wired (outdated, but needed due to the shoddy wifi in the hotel). The pool area and LAZY RIVER is a must-visit if you're staying at the hotel in the summer months.

Dining: I found the dining here to be overpriced, even for the Strip. Skip the food court, if possible - I paid almost $9 for a 6"" Subway and bag of chips. Yusho and Double Barrel restaurants caught my eye but the prices drove me elsewhere. I heard the buffet was no good, so we skipped that. There are a few highlights, however: Tried Blvd. Creamery, where they have interesting alcoholic ice cream\/sorbet. I ate at Diablo's a few years back and if they still have it, the $40 burrito was a great deal. 

Entertainment: Blue Man Group is the headliner here. If you can't catch them, they have a free processional through the lobby at 6:15 PM. Due to its location, it is easy to check out club and show offerings of other hotels. Only gambled my first night here and broke even. If you're new to gambling, take advantage of a free daily 11 AM craps lesson!

Overall: About as middle-of-the-road as you can get in Vegas. The Monte Carlo's location, ease of access, and pool make for its shortcomings. Price-wise, it's usually comparable to TI, Bally's, Tropicana and NYNY. Although not my favorite hotel from that group, I would stay here again without hesitation.",9,3,3

This is a good hotel for those who want to party all night and then have some place to crash afterwards. For $39 a night on certain weeknights who can complain.

I've only stayed here once.  The room was average for a hotel on the Strip.  If I were to compare it to a room not in Vegas, then I'd give our room at the Monte Carlo Hotel a 5 star rating.  Since I'm comparing it to other hotels in Vegas, I'd have to give them 3 stars instead.  Room was clean, tastefully decorated, comfortable, and I got a great night's sleep.

I have not eaten at any of the restaurants here so no help there.  I haven't even eaten at their buffet.  

What I do like about the Monte Carlo is the casino.  I'm not a high roller.  My budget nowadays is $20 to $50 for gambling whenever we go to Vegas, and I have never gone over the budget.  I pretty much consider that money a donation.  At Monte Carlo, though, my $20 turned into $500!!  That's why I'm giving them 4 stars!  I'm a fan of a casino that will give me money!

Another positive about the place is the location.  It is walking distance to all the major hotels on the Strip.  Very convenient.

Bottom line is I probably would not stay here again unless the price was right.  I will play again at their casino though!  Maybe next time, my $20 will turn into $1000!!",1,3,1

I didn't actually read all 52 cause that's a lot of reviews....but here's my 2 cents.  The Monte Carlo is one of those large hotels on the strip but is relatively unassuming compared to other monsters out there.  It's nice, it's classy (in that Vegas sort of way) and it's not too overdone with giant sphinxes and steaming volcano's.  The prices are always moderate compared to the other biggies and the rooms are nice, spacious and well kept.  It's centrally located on the strip so you can experience the ostentatiousness of some of the other hotel attractions, but then come back to something a little less gaudy.  I have not sampled the food, although they do have a kick ass concierge floor that my co-worker was staying on.

During check-in we were greeted by a not-so-friendly worker. (Who also almost mischarged us more). We were so tired that we didn't address the issue then and there. We went to our room and were very pleased. It overlooked the pools and everything was clean. (I think some rooms must be more updated than others. Because reading other reviews regarding outdated things and cleanliness, I cannot relate). 

My boyfriend and I decided to go down and speak to someone. We spoke to a very friendly and helpful person at the concierge who then introduced us to the manager. He was super nice and accommodating and we were upgraded to a better room. We were so happy! The new room was great, two bathrooms, a couch, lots of space and overlooked the strip.

Food - We had the pub on our first day and it was great. There's also a good slushie place downstairs near Starbucks.

We'd found a really outstanding rate for the long weekend and having never even walked into the place on previous visits to Sin City weren't sure what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised.

The cab dropped us off and a bellman was there within seconds to take our luggage. Our luggage was taken away and we were given a number to call to have it delivered once we were in our rooms. It was so easy. 

We walked in and I immediately noticed how good it smelled. This is not the typical experience I've found, especially when smoky casinos are involved. The friendly staff member who checked us in informed us that the pleasant fragrance was from the fresh-cut roses seen all over the lobby that were also placed into the ventilation system. The bell desk staff was also very friendly. We'd ordered a motorized scooter to be delivered for my grandmother (we were in town celebrating her 80th birthday and while she can play slots all day and night she can't walk there) and it was ready and waiting. The whole check-in process took at most ten minutes.

The rooms were very nice and our luggage arrived within 5 minutes of calling to request it. The rooms were quite spacious with clean, soft bedding and plenty of pillows. There weren't enough hangers in the closet which is not something that bothered me but if you're like my grandmother who apparently is allergic to wrinkled clothing you might want to bring or request extra. The bathrooms were pretty typical, very clean and stocked with plenty of towels. The biggest issue with our rooms, which were on the pool side of the hotel, presented itself the next morning when the pool opened and the music blared from 9 AM - 6 PM. It was loudest on Friday and Saturday so if you are one who likes to sleep in or take naps so you can party all night you may want to request a room that doesn't overlook the pool.

Speaking of the pool area...it was quite nice. There were people lined up at 9:00 every morning to be sure to get seats but many of them just put towels on chairs and took off. The days we got to the pool later in the day we had a bit of trouble locating chairs but always found some. The wave pool was a lot of fun and the other pools were also great, never overcrowded even with the place was packed. They have some ridiculous pool rules, however, namely the rule against bringing food or beverage. I understand that they want to sell as much food and drink as possible but to not allow even bottled water is a little silly, especially in the DESERT. We ended up purchasing bottles (at $5 each) but they were served with as many cups as we wanted and plenty of ice. Drinks were pricey as was the food which meant we didn't do much drinking or eating at the pool. 

There were plenty of options for food in the hotel including a food court with plenty of quick and economical choices including McDonald's, Subway, Starbucks, Sbarro and Rubio's. The Cafe is open 24 hours and had really great food ranging from breakfast to sandwiches to pasta, etc. We also dined at the Italian restaurant, D. Vino, and the food\/wine were excellent. 

The casino is on the smaller side but still has plenty of tables and slot machines. I really don't gamble all that much but managed to have a good time on the penny slots. 

Housekeeping was a bit pushy. I am not the type to need my room cleaned every day which seemed to be something that unnerved them. They called and left messages every day and were in our rooms seemingly within seconds if we neglected to hang the ""do not disturb"" sign. They also did room check at 9 AM on the day we were checking out when official check-out wasn't until 11 AM and we were even granted an extra hour at no charge. I suppose this is better than having unresponsive and incompetent cleaning staff.

I really enjoyed my experience at the Monte Carlo and would definitely stay there again!",1,1,1

We were in a newly remodeled room on the 24th floor. The room smelled like new carpet and was cute with trendy décor. However, a few trendy features do not make a luxury room or a luxury hotel! The window was small and had cheap coverings. There were no robes or slippers and the linens were mediocre. The bed was comfortable. There was no in-room coffee or tea and none offered on the floor. There was no fridge and no space or stands to set suitcases on. The bathroom had a modern finish with a shower (no tub) and no toilet room. The shower itself had very poor water pressure and there were no adjustable settings. It was a chore getting the shampoo and conditioner rinsed out of my hair. The toiletries (soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion) was very, very, very cheap. I have experienced better showers at Holiday Inn\/Hampton Inns. There was no room guide so I don't even know if they have room service or not. On a positive note, the Sambalatte coffee shop on the property was very good! AFTER booking the room we received an email notifying us that the pool was under construction. However, we were able to take a shuttle to the Mandalay Bay pools. The Mandalay pools were extremely overcrowded (assumedly due to the additional guests from Monte Carlo?) and it was difficult to find a place to sit. There were too few complimentary water stations and people were literally passing out! I had to assist a young girl who seemed to suffer from dehydration. There were not enough poolside servers and we sat over 10 minutes at a bar with no greeting and left without a drink. We overheard a patron ask the bartender, ""If it's not too much trouble can I get some ice when you get a minute?"" and the bartender replied quite dryly ""What's the magic word?"" This is not a luxury experience. We have also stayed at the Mandarin, Vdara and the Aria in the past year for a very similar price point and enjoyed those properties much more! It seems the Monte Carlo is taking advantage of their location next to the T-Mobile arena and is charging top dollar for pocket-change service and vacation experience. Total for two nights was $650.

The pool scene here is laughable, it is very much a Wal-Mart crowd. The water in the lazy river smells like it was pumped fresh from the bathtubs of the hotel. The rooms all have issues and aren't the cleanest, but the beds are comfy and overall not too horrible.

If it's just my husband and I, we'd be staying at Bellagio, but when you bring the kids, Monte Carlo used to be our destination of choice in Vegas.  It was never a 5 star destination location, but because it was easy, reasonable, had one of the best pool complexes in Vegas and was good for the family, Not Anymore.
Everything from customer service, to amenities to the property itself is in need of a major over-haul. We had booked two adjoining rooms this time.  When we arrived at 5:00 p.m. on a Friday, we were told no adjoining rooms available.  Wasn't until we escalated our concern to a supervisor did we get the rooms that we had actually requested.  Representative at check- in was rude and lacking in customer service skills...not a great way to start a weekend.
Next, rooms were outdated and worn.  Granted, you don't spend a whole lot of time in your rooms in Vegas, but with so many options these days, would expect better. You are charged a $20 per night resort fee that gets you two Kerurig K-cups, two small bottles of water, access to the overcrowded\/loud pool and the gym - what it doesn't cover is Wi-Fi in the rooms - because they don't offer Wi-Fi in the rooms - only wired connection if you can hunt down the cord.  
Walls are paper-thin - you can hear every conversation outside of your room.
Pool was a nightmare...crowded beyond belief....drunks everywhere you turn - ABSOLUTELY not family friendly.  So many drunks in the lazy river had to get kids out before a full lap around.  Very loud at the pool...not a single spot where you could just relax and read  or chill...Also, service at the pool was terrible.  Was dying to eat waited 45 minutes for a waitress..ended up having to get up and find someone myself.
Had dinner at the buffet - food was mediocre at best. (honestly, some of the worst Prime Rib I have every had  - tasted like it was pre-made and rewarmed for serving - no one is our party was ablet o have more than a bite or two of it) Significantly smaller than most other buffets in Vegas and far less crowded.  Would not go back to buffet.
As others have mentioned, there is a food court, but don't fool yourself into thinking it's cheap like the food court at home, this is after-all, Vegas.  A slice of pizza, a dinner salad and a drink was $16.
The only reason I would ever consider staying here again would be 1) the location - prime spot for walking to other attractions locally (especially if you have kids and are willing to pass on the pool, M&M Factory and Coca Cola store are right across the street, movies theaters right across the street and roller coaster at NYNY is next door. 2) the tram to Bellagio...easy access to another prime spot on the strip (on a Saturday night we were able to get to Ceasar's in about 15 minutes.  We were too tired to walk back and were going to take a cab - was told cost on a Saturday night would have been around a $40 cab ride in traffic.  Tram is free  3) easy access - very easy to get on and off of Highway 15 without having to spend much driving time on Las Vegas Blvd.",0,0,0

Nonetheless, I expected our rooms at the Monte Carlo to have that ""Vegas look."" Wrong. The rooms looked as good if not worse than any other generic hotel, such as La Quinta. I've stayed at Hiltons that have by far better rooms than this. But I guess for the price I pay, what do I expect. No wifi was an inconvenience as well as no microwave nor fridge? I know to many its not a huge playing factor, but when you're there for a week, its nice to have food\/drinks on hand without burning a hole in your pocket or having to go down to the lobby. Shitty showert that would clog and super loud flush for the toilet. Walls are thin. We heard everything and anything the people next door were doing. 

Another issue was room service. Your room service staff is very friendly BUT out of the 6 days we stayed, our room was cleaned once on the 2nd day. You best believe by the 6th it seemed like a tornado had hit. (We were only in our room to sleep and gone 80% of the day\/night).

I also won a nice amount of money in the casino. :) Maybe it was beginners luck because I rarely gamble lol.

4 stars because I handed the maid a $10 tip before I left the room for her to clean it and she did a horrible job.. All she did was remake the beds.

The pool is awesome. Lazy river, wave pool and a volleyball court. Casino isn't crazy big and just the right size. Game options are good, plenty to choose from. They have a food court with a good amount of options. Id avoid it though cause they literally rape you with the prices there. $10 for a $5 subway footlong?!

Location isn't bad either, it's at the beginning\/middle of the strip. It's convenient that there's a CVS right in front of the hotel and tons of places to eat within the vicinity.

Ice machine in floor 5 didn't work so I had to go to floor 3 and they don't sell coke at all I hate pepsi!! Lol ignore soda comment I'm just been really picky.
I will give this hotel another try since I hace stay here before and I love their customer service!! See you soon Vegas",2,1,0

The first room they gave us wasn't made up yet so they moved us to another immediately (unfortunately, the first room was facing the Strip, the second room was in back & faced construction). While the pricing was good, the one big drawback about booking through Expedia was we weren't guaranteed a king bed (instead of two queen). We were there to celebrate our anniversary so we didn't want two queen beds! When I called the hotel to confirm our reservation & ask about the bed situation, they said they'd note our anniversary but still couldn't guarantee anything. Comfortable room, decent casino, friendly staff, included a free meal at the buffet (we used it for lunch & it was quite good for a big buffet). A little disappointed with the pool - the surrounding buildings block the sun so it was quite chilly & the pool's odd shape makes it nearly impossible to do laps.

A lot of people might say this is an old casino worth not going to but I really believe that this place does take very good care of the customer! Which is you and when you, and when you are on vacation you want to be nice and happy!

One thing I love about it was how friendly the check in counter was. The girl literally told me what her plans were for the weekend. Be reminded that I did check in on Thursday and stayed till Tuesday. It was a long week for me in Monte Carlo but I did feel a sense of belonging! Fast service and then after that when we needed extra towels a few times, they brought it up quickly and left in a second!

Alright so what else is great about this resort? Well the pool is amazing. I was in that pool daily and I loved it. They have many different types of pools, a small wave one, a lagoon, and just regular pool. All were really nice and the music was amazing!! 

What more can you ask for? Also they do let you drink alcohol but you have to buy it from the pool side area. If you want come early because this place is pretty packed and the lines for alchy can become long! 

With soo many lounge chairs to be able to lay around and be comfortable is amazing! I thought this place should really get an award for being on top of comfort for guest ! 

I love also how it is connect with Aria and Bellagio by this awesome new tram. Just ask for assistance if you can't find it and someone will really help you out! No Joke. 

Thanks for making my week a very great and fun time,I will for sure recommend coming here if you love to have a great time in the pool and quick service! :)",7,2,4

Mmm, let's start by saying that when I first went into the room my first thought was ""ugh... it does not look like in the picture, the bed is missing the red tootsie roll pillow (or whatever that pillow it's called). I thought it would have a fridge, but it didn't, it would have been nice, but I guess I should have paid more, but now I know; we had to use the sink as a cooler (that's always the cheaper option haha).

Anyway, back to review what was actually there (it's so easy for me to go off on tangents). 

Air quality in the elevators and hallways to go to the room is bad, and I don't know what it is, but it smells like old people's house but once you go into the room and lower the temperature to 60-65 degrees then you feel better. 

Everything was fresh and clean: bedding & towels. They have good room service too, I ordered more towels and they took them within 20 minutes, I feel like a cheap ass now because I forgot to tip the guy :(

There was one problem though, the bathroom door was too long or I don't know what the problem was, the thing is that to close it you had to force it shut and it would make a lot of noise (inconvenient for the other people sleeping because it would totally wake them up).

The pools:
They have the lazy river, I loved that thing! That's great for children and grown ups like us that don't know how to swim but that don't want to look dumb just standing in the pool. They also have a wave pool, that was fun too, they activate\/deactivate the waves approximately every 15 minutes (don't quote me on the time, that's what it felt like). The waves won't catch you off guard because they have this ""recess bell sound"" that warns you they are being activated. My wanna be bf, told me there was another pool, I was distracted looking at the $31 sandals they have so I don't remember but anyway, YEAH, if you need sandals and don't want to spend $31 go to the Ross that is right on the strip like a block away from the Monte Carlo. WE got some very cute sandals for like $10! Just saying, that should be a total separate review on Ross, I know, Sorry.

Bottom Line: Definitely this is not nicest place that I've stayed at, but for $180 for two nights I can't complaint, it had a great location. Will I stay there again? Probably not.",3,2,2

First time staying here & it was great!

We got to Vegas super early around 9am & decided to go ask what was the earliest we can check in, their response: How about in 20 minutes? - Sweet! 

ROOM: Clean, we could see the pool, comfortable bed
Roomy bathroom. Everything worked & it was clean.

POOL: Fun, fun, fun! They have 3 pools, a wave pool so I felt like I was at Hurricane Harbor but waaaaay less kids, they have a DJ and awesome drinks that made me loose track of time. They have a lazy river where we spotted half of the Jersey Shore crew...well not really but they sure looked like them!  Then a regular pool & a jacuzzi.
If you don't like loud music while you lay out in the pool this is not the place for you.

The Buffet: We got a complementary buffet so we opted for the breakfast one, since Champagne was included we sat here for over 3hrs drinking & no one bother us, waitress (Karla you rock!) kept refilling & checking on us to make sure we were doing good but not being intrusive. 

Diablos: This place sucks ass, it was not packed at all & we were told that we couldn't get a table unless we were eating an Entree, there was not room to sit on the bar so I pointed out to the host that all their meals contained meat & since I don't eat it, I just wanted drinks & appetizers. She replied with ""Fine, we are not that busy"" 
Food was gross. Waitress was cool.

The Cafe: Great breakfast, service was good & prices were good.

Their Stores: Super Pricey!! we got back at 2am from a concert, rough night, needed water & end up paying $5 for a small bottle!! Discovered the ABC store across the street the next day & things got better.

We were allowed to check out at 12pm so it was perfect.
No wait to check in or check out, guess we timed it good.
Internet never worked so they reversed the hotel fee to our card.

Parents: Not a great place for kids, please take them somewhere else.",0,0,0

However, the price we paid was great (as we got a Groupon deal) and it is in a good part of the strip. Also parking was easy (short walking distance from the structure to the lobby!), they give a coupon for 2 free drinks, and self checkout was great!

The rooms are pretty standard; its clean, some items show wear and tear... one thing I didn't like was the thin walls... you could easily hear guests in the next room. Luckily we weren't in the room most of the time, we were just there to sleep after partying!

Overall, an OK place. The highlights for me were the parking and the self checkout :) I would come here again if the price was right. Thanks!",3,3,1

They are definitely due for a renovation.

The room was clean, comfortable and satisfactory when we checked in. The thermostat read a 74* F when we put our luggage in & then went out to the strip (without running the AC while we were out). 

When we returned to our room later at night, we still had not even turned on the air yet. The room was more warm by then & smelled of traces of mildew. The scent was stronger around the carpet area surrounding the tub. I figure, we'll it's a spa room, what can you expect. I am sure the previous guests have carelessly distributed to this and condensation from use of the tub has absorbed into the carpeting. 

I opened the window to air it out a bit so it wasn't so humid & there was a horrible toxic tar chemical coming from the construction tractors working on the rubble below. After 15 minutes, the room filled up with these gross toxic fumes, so we decided to shut the window and run the air. This seemed to help over the next couple of hours...

The shower and toilet faucet, drain, spouts and handle hardware looked awful, they looked as if pieces were ""peeling"" & were mismatched of gold, brushed nickel, stainless steel. The tiling in the shower was deeply stained, and showed of signs of heavy wear and tear, broken and chipped. 

We were awoken early the next morning by loud construction tractor sounds coming from direction of the window. I figure, OK, so it's normal early morning hours during the week, so we understand that this may be a potential thing. So we didn't complain. 

The second night came about & It wasn't til 1 am I realized this construction job never ends and like the city, they operate & work 24\/7. 

3 am strikes & I have a hard time falling asleep to the noisy ruckus they were causing outside. Had I known there were going to be some construction going on, I would have requested to stay on another side of the tower. There was no construction discount or notice as we booked the room, so this was not expected. I was finally able to fall asleep with a pillow over my head. 

The duvet blanket on the bed looked like it came from a homeless shelter. It had many holes in it, wasn't in a cover and it was placed between one flat sheet and another. 

I purchased my room through the MLife website through the $134.99 \/per night rate & receive a $50 credit promotion. They never mentioned anything the promo credit it in my confirmation email or when I checked it. The MLife desk was closed when I attempted to ask about it. We checked out & then went to the Mlife desk & then the representative got approval to give us a meal credit at the hotel buffet. That was nice :)",2,0,1

I selected a deluxe room and confirmed directly with hotel for a KING size bed.  I called the hotel a couple of weeks before our arrival date and requested NOT to be assigned near the noisy construction site, and the hotel staff accepted our request. 

We arrived on 04\/27\/16 and the check-in process was smooth and efficient and it all ended there. Upon check-in I reminded the check-in desk staff of my request for a KING size bed and NOT to be assigned near the construction site. The staff informed me they were ""committed"" for the night and I was assigned two queen beds. Staff cited I purchased the ""Best Rate"" available ($400.00 + the $30.00 per day BS resort fee) and she could move me to a higher floor for an additional $10.00 a day, which I declined. Staff's statement seemed scripted. I assumed no big deal, two queen beds would suffice. 

I accepted my room key and headed to room 05-331 (5th floor room #331). As I walked towards my room I noticed a good chunk 6'x6' of wall paper was missing from the wall adjacent to my room (another clue of a classy hotel) and the elevator doors had indication of graffiti. 

Entered my room and looked out the window to find I was assigned a room looking directly at the construction site (Photos attached).

Let's just start off by saying what I'm about to write is not even exaggerated on my 1 night experience at the Monte Carlo. Mind you I'm local to Las Vegas area, have stayed in almost all hotels on the strip so I'm not a newbie to this town, know many in this hospitality industry and do A LOT for this community at large. A trip that was suppose to be a seamlessly STRESS FREE stay was far from it! This was suppose to be an experience for my daughter attending the Ariana Grande concert across the street at MGM Grand and had plans to do a little sightseeing beforehand. Needless to say plans changed!

CHECK-IN: It all started when we valeted at the Monte Carlo to check-in. My reservation was no where to be found in their system so thought nothing of it and figured it was a technical glitch of sorts. I proceeded to check-in where I waited for approx. 30 min. in line. Once I got to the front where a nice polite gentleman began to assist he too tried to locate my reservation and clearly did the best he could. Unfortunately, after exhausting all his options he had to call in a manager. To make a long story short it was about another 30 min. of him trying to work the issue, but it got escalated to Zach Bell who was the manager onsite at the time. I provided all the documentation and evidence (i.e. credit card used where I pre-paid, drivers license, reservation email booked on MonteCarlo.com). Anything I could prove to show it was a COMPLETE RESERVATION I provided!  After a complete 1+hrs  trying to check-in we FINALLY got keys to our room on the 30th floor. 

THE 1ST ROOM: The room provided to us was on the 30th floor when immediately upon entering were welcomed with an overpowering bold smell of cigarette smoke. It was by far disgusting! In addition, the decor from the wall, to the wires exposed along the base boards and the dingy\/stained wallpaper was enough to deal with (pics provided). Unfortunately, had to go back to guest services and see about getting moved to a 2nd room, which went hassle free (good news there). 

THE 2ND ROOM: After getting keys to a new room just a few feet from the original it was even worse in terms of a smoke smell. This time it was the overwhelming smell of weed filling up the hallway and even our room! It was so strong NO ONE could miss it! The room was a little better than the last decor wise,  but since I was traveling with 2 young girls especially one with special needs it was not healthy to keep her there. This time I phoned the front desk from the room to see what could be done. Eventually transferred to Zach the mgr who stated he would ensure the next room would be checked out by the housekeeping supervisor so we did not have to continually move from room to room. Within a few min housekeeping supervisor met me (nice lady) at the room to verify not only the smell, but to check-in on us. Since she did not manage the 25th floor  she could not do anything to further assist us. She then later called Zach again to see what we were to do and was told someone would be coming up to assist us with our luggage and move us into the new room located on the 25th floor. Of course none of this happened! I WAITED 30 minutes before heading downstairs to guest services AGAIN to figure out what was going on. The lady who was assisting (she had glasses on) was reading through all the notes and later determined the room was placed on hold. I began to ask her WHY is the room on hold and no one is communicating with me on what to do next. Needless to say, after dealing with the matter she finally handed over our new keys to the 3rd room. I was so frustrated by this point I was NOT going to leave without new keys in hand or without someone escorting us as originally communicated. 

THE 3RD ROOM: After over 2 hrs from the time I tried to check-in we FINALLY made it to room 25-335. Feeling exhausted with this experience we finally settled into our room. The appearance of the room was no different from the other 2. It just smelled less like smoke. Let's just say these rooms need a MAJOR OVERHAUL. 

CHECKING OUT: Considering everything I went through I managed to get a complimentary late check-out and the resort fee waived for inconvenience, which was appreciated given the craziness from the prior day. Needless to say things went from almost being OK, to yet another nightmare! In the process of trying to use the EXPRESS CHECKOUT I had noticed a charge of $109.00. Knowing I had already pre-paid $186.48 (12\/29) and showed this to the front-desk yesterday and forwarded my confirmation email directly to Zach Bell figured there had to be a mistake. I proceeded AGAIN to GUEST SERVICES where I was finally assisted by Clayton Horger. He proceeded to tell me because of a 'vendor' partner that did not pay them I had to be charged $109 because they did not receive payment. MIND YOU I BOOKED AND RESERVED MY HOTEL ON MONTECARLO.COM.

Pros: Love the variety of pools, lazy river has current and wave pool makes a dip quite fun!

Elevators are SO close to everything, if you got kids, are senior or just plain lazy like me, food, pool, casino and exits are all within 50 feet from the elevator.  Wish more resorts were laid out with this convenience in mind.

The chaise lounges at the pools are also dirty and stained. You have to climb in it because there is no room on either side of the lounges. They are one on top of the other. The towels at the pool had either yellow stains, holes, shredding at the edges or all of the above.

  For 19 years the Monte Carlo was the laid back property in the shadow of the High energy NY-NY and MGM Grand. In the heart of Bright Light City it never lit up the pizazz. However, it's laid back atmosphere carried a special aura. 

  The closing of the Monte Carlo coincides with the end of an era. With the pending name change and refurbishment, the days of complimentary parking to spend money at a property is going the name of the Monte Carlo name. But that act of greetiness would be factored into the new resort's review. This is a shame because the pre T-Mobile Arena Monte Carlo parking garage has was the best place to park on the Strip. Parking is as easy as turning off Frank Sinatra Drive onto Park Drive then making two lefts into a well designed garage. In the last couple of years this was my parking garage of choice on the Strip. The best part of parking here was a signalized exit onto Frank Sinatra Drive. 

    After parking my car, there were a few traditions that I enjoyed. After walking along the marble floor of the lobby under the chandeliers I'd sometimes turn right into the ordinary casino following the wall of the Blue Man Theatre to end up at the Monte Carlo Sambalatte to enjoy a cup of coffee. Then sometimes from the lobby, I'd turn left onto the Street of Dreams to enter the attached Aria for a drink in a pub. Regardless of what I did, the Monte Carlo was a gateway to the Strip. 

   After MGM built the City Center, I always considered The Monte Carlo part of the development. It is attached to the Aria which is the heart and soul of City Center. The Street of Dreams retail corridor leads from the lobby and casino to an escalator that transitions into the Aria walkway. The Monte Carlo is to the Aria what Bally's is to Paris, which is a glorified older wing. For the money conscious consumer that is not big on hotel room amenities, the Monte Carlo is a way to enjoy the Aria for less money. The Monte Carlo is also connected to a Monorail to The Bellagio. 

   I have had mixed reactions on the job they do with the theme. The outside of the hotel is interesting minus the pizazz of NY-NY and several Las Vegas Strip icons. Inside, the hotel lobby is where the theme shines. The Street of Dreams is a poor attempt at a Monte Carlo theme. Instead of the ceilings of painted changing skies at competing resorts, the sky of a Monte Carlo street is a black ceiling with exposed pipes. The relatively large casino is an ordinary expanse of indoor space that is more inviting for passing through than stopping to spend time. 

   Over the years I have spent plenty of time inside Monte Carlo. Taking into account that I am a coffee fan, in addition to Sambalatte that opened a year ago, there were fun times at the food court and Street of Dreams Starbuck's. Late at night I'd enjoy relaxing on a comfortable couch in the Street of Dreams Starbuck's before heading to the car. When I was in a beer mood, there were times that I'd venture into the Pub to enjoy a cold one while watching the Dueling Piano players. In the earlier hours, there were times I'd stop in the Monte Carlo Food Court for a quick meal at McDonald's (out of Business), Nathan's (Out of Business), and Sbarro. I was never impressed with the over priced buffet. It was more than food and drink that kept me inside. A few years ago, we saw Lance Burton perform in the theater. In the theater of slot machines and table games, I rarely gambled here. 

   In the 19 years that I knew the Monte Carlo, zero nights were spent in one of their hotel rooms. There really was no reason to; especially after the ridiculous resort fee. I do know that 1) it is a 4 Diamond AAA rated resort and 2) is associated with Hyatt. As a matter of fact there is a rumor that the name is being changed to Hyatt Park Place. 

  With the final curtain closing in on the Monte Carlo, I am left to say goodbye to one more Las Vegas icon. Monte Carlo resort, if I don't get the chance to see you again this review is my way of saying, ""Goodbye and thank you for the memories.",16,8,13

I've stayed at several hotels now in Vegas and I've enjoyed most. I enjoyed Monte Carlo because of how of everything I actually did while I stayed at the hotel. The pool was great, I usually don't go to the pools in Vegas. This one had a lazy boy if you want to just relax while the water pushes you. A relaxing jacuzzi. I'm not much of a gambler either I usually go to Vegas to party and enjoy the clubs and the strip. But the casino was great too. I had a good time playing. One thing I didn't know was that you have to pay for parking now, I think it's at all MGM hotels now but I'm not 100% sure. I did love that as soon as we parked the car in the parking lot all we did was walk over the bridge and the lobby to check in was right there. Most hotels you have to walk a mile to get there.

Call housekeeping and all they say is that they will tell the housekeeping supervisor.  The carpet in the hallways were all bunched up and it and the rooms needed to be updated.  Then they hang up.  Nice. Not.  We paid for a high floor strip view.  When we reached our room it over looked the freeway and construction.  We called the front desk and was told by a young man that they did not guarantee rooms with views and that they did not have any left.  I told him that we paid for it and then I would like some of the charges taken off then seeing a room with a strip view cost more.  He said he would not do that.  We asked to be transferred to VIP lounge and he said they would not be able to do anything either.  We insisted that he transfer us and he finally did.  We explained to the young lady what had happen and what do you know we are being moved to another room, this time it is with a partial view of the strip and construction.WOW!!!  Then we decided to head to Diablos for some drinks.  They had plenty of open tables on the patio, but no where to sit at the bar.  So we decided to sit at a table.  We were told that we could not sit there if we did not eat dinner.  So we left.  Went to Ignite Bar in the Monte Carlo Casino and while we were playing video poker we ordered 4 Jager Bombs for our birthdays.  We drank them and then they told us it was $60.00.  Oh, I thought drinks were comp while playing games.  Guess not.  Then we were being snubbed by the bartenders the rest of the night.  We spoke with the bar manager and hotel manager.  Nothing was really done.  The bar manager gave us a free drink at a different bar.  That was nice of him.  When we checked out of the casino we wanted a copy of our bill so we went back to VIP lounge and we were told (very rudely) that we need to stand in line outside with the other people.  This is for invited guest only, but since we were there they would check us out.  Really????  Invited guest????  They do not pay for anything, and we are paying and you treat and talk to us like that?  Well needless to say, I will never stay nor recommend this MOTEL every again.

Like the big turd this place is it started small and just grew in girth and un-pleasantness as the trip continued. When I first arrived in the evening my only desire was to shower; there were zero towels, which took almost 45 min to have the front desk send. Then the lights in the bathroom went out, I looked for another light switch thinking surely these fluorescent bulbs are operational but they weren't. Then after taking a darken shower I wanted to go to bed and discovered a dark brownish poop like stain on the sheets, the part that goes near my face. See pictures. Throughout the night I woke up covered in sweat as I learned the A\/C wasn't working. How you can have a non-working AC in a hotel located in desert is a mystery to me. 

Finally I called the front desk (after being on hold for about 15 min) and was transferred rooms, doubling down on my luck hoping that the next room would be better or at least conform to motel 6 standards. Rolled these dice and it came up 7. The next room also had a non-functioning A\/C but it gets better, early in the morning I woke up to the sound of heavy drilling. At first I thought it was the construction on the closed down pool, that's right they closed the entire pool area down the entire trip but charged me the same and didn't discount my room 1 cent for the totally absent pool area.  This room had a couch with giant stains that all told a romantic sticky story. When I had friends over they went to flip the cushions so they could sit while we got ready but what we found were even more stains that in fear of un-wanted pregnancies none of us sat on. 

When I brought this to the attention of the hotel staff they said ""What do you want me to do about it?"" Keep in mind this hotel is not cheap, the rates are comparable to other much better hotels in the area but offers not even half of what the others do like caesars palace and the Bellagio.

For those of you reading this considering staying here; DON'T! There are plenty of other nice hotel and casinos in the area that have actual themes and rooms with something more than the monte carlo's tacky colorful tiles glued on the dimly light bathroom walls.

We were given 1 bar of soap to share between the shower and sink (ew!) and a broken hair dryer. Not enough pillows in the room and the beds are horrible to share because they sink in the middle. 

I am extremely disappointed with the how gross the room was and how outdated and broken down the beds and furniture is. I would never stay here again even if it was free.",3,0,0

hotel is ok, rooms was big

pools were nice

restaurants were good

hotel - seems a little old (rugs and decor) not so new and feels old

staff very good

my big complaint is not their fault  (I guess) - hotel smells of smoke and deodorant\/cologne\/perfume.  I didnt go to Vegas to gamble or drink (visited a sick friend) - my complaint is nothing is non smoking - really stinks all over the strip inside - inside casinos is almost unbearable with the smoke

I asked concierge and they mentioned there is a non smoking casino off the strip, if I ever go back - I will stay there


also the walls were very thin - I could hear normal conversations from room next door

1) It has a tram which will connect you to nicer hotels

2) Their food court has a Rubio's and a Starbucks.

Other than that, it is at the same level as Excalibur, Luxor, and Harrah's. Hotwire classifies this hotel as a 4 star, which is NOT accurate. It is definitely a 3 star. Their gym and spa is decent, but it's not that nice. Also, another reviewer accurately described this hotel as smelling ""like burning hand lotion."" The newer casinos have better ventilation so they don't have to have that overpowering smell, but the Monte Carlo tries to cover it up with an extremely intense potpourri scent.

I was aware of the resort fee because you are told about this in writing when you reserve online.  Also the resort fee is for each full day you stay so you don't pay the fee on the day you check in or out.  Check in was slow and there were only about three people in each line.  I had a free all day buffet pass as part of my reservation. I didn't like the food so I barely ate anything.  The room and beds are comfortable. 

 The pool was nice and we grabbed a partial shaded spot because it get's blistering hot during summer.  I recommend this even if you aren't right next to the pool.  The server brought drinks we ordered and I was irritated that once the pool started picking up she never came over again to offer an order even though I tipped her really well and it wasn't ever packed at all. Then when I went to get a mojito at the bar, the bartender was rude too. Don't take your dead end job out on me dude!

The Diablo restaurant at Monte Carlo was a shame. They didn't seem to have air conditioning and it was horribly hot. I ordered a $20 quesadilla and it looked and tasted like something I would make for my kids in the microwave.  The service wasn't that great either and the wait was pitifully long.  I guess the Diablo restaurant wants to make you feel like you're in hell...pun intended? I wouldn't recommend eating here EVER!

When rinsing our hands and brushing our teeth we notice the sink in the bathroom would take a while for the water to go down the drain. Aside that it smelled horribly we had to wait a while for the water to go down and drain and for either of us would use it again. We then left Monte Carlo hotel at 6:05am on April 28, 2016 to go to the Grand Canyon. We returned to the hotel at approximately 10:30pm the same day April 28, 2016.  We stopped by our room to pick up our car keys to go to dinner. We noticed our hotel room's bathtub had a drained problem since it was clogged and had a water overflow so we called Housekeeping from our hotel room. The Housekeeping transferred our call to Engineering, and I was told that they would come into our room while we went to dinner to repair the overflow, drain clogged, water in our bathtub and bathroom sink. Apparently, when we returned to our hotel room at approximately around 2:30am on Friday the problem with water flow and clogged bathtub was not fixed. Also during our return to the hotel at 2:30am on Friday, April 29, 2016, we realized we were missing my sisters Kunnika Junnumsub's Invisalign braces. 
We then called the front desk immediately from our hotel room to report a lost\/stolen report for Kunnika's Invisalign braces. Within 30 minutes a gentleman named Billy knocked on our hotel room and introduced himself, he mentioned he works for the Lost\/Stolen department. Billy asked us questions, we answered and also described to him that before we left our hotel room, on April 28, 2016 Kunnika had placed her Invisalign braces on top of the brown ice bucket which was located inside the bathroom, on the sink counter. However, as soon as we entered our restroom getting ready for bed, we realized that Kunnika's Invisalign braces were missing. After, Billy had us fill out a form called ""Voluntary Statement' in which Kunnika had signed her name. Billy mentioned that the Risk management will contact us within a few days. However, as of today, May 8, 2016, the Risk management department at Monte Carlo hotel has not reached out to myself, or Kunnika. So, on Friday, April 29, 2016 around 4 am we went to sleep, and at approximately 10:30am on April 29, 2016, there were two gentlemen banging on our hotel room door which woke us up. As we ran toward the door to open our hotel room to see who it was, suddenly my hotel room door was opened by these 2 gentlemen who introduced themselves as the Room Maintenance\/Engineering staff to come fix the bathtub over flow water and tub clogged. The hotel management can verify my statement by checking to see that the Hotel Engineer inserted his employee keycard into our hotel room. We were very surprised with the action of the Monte Carlo hotel engineers and we also were scared since we did not expect someone to open our hotel room while we were sleeping. My sister Kunnika and I were still in our Pajamas. Not to mention the Air conditioner was very noisy which caused us unable to fall asleep. We did request a quiet room and privacy when we checked in the front desk. We believe we spoke to Gina. However, she gave us a connecting room and we felt it was scary and unsafe. 
 
When we checked out at Monte Carlo on Friday, April 29, 2016 afternoon, we spoke to Amanda and expressed our concerns while staying at Monte Carlo hotel. Amanda suggested us to write Comments card which it will escalate to the highest management at Monte Carlo so management can help us to resolve our concerns.
 
We also spoke to Reina, the housekeeper at Monte Carlo hotel on Fri 4\/29\/16 at 1pm, we asked her to check with the person who cleaned our room on Thursday 4\/28\/16 and we let Reina know that Kunnika's Invisalign braces was missing when we returned to our hotel that day.
 
Kunnika's Braces clear Invisalign estimated $5,700 USD which she paid out of her pocket which it was missing when return the hotel on April 29, 2016. Now she is in pain for not having the correct size of braces to wear nightly, and her teeth start to shift around which cause her migraine headaches, and she is unable to sleep.  Due to this issue, Kunnika is unable to work and perform her daily activities. 

This was an unpleasant experience staying at Monte Carlo hotel with it being our first time staying at the Monte Carlo hotel and Casino and will be the last time. I will also, mention my unpleasant experience to all my family and friends so they never book a day at this hotel. 

We have been waiting weeks, to hear from the Risk management which never reached out to us. Billy who came up to our hotel room and wrote the report promised us Risk management will reach out to us on Monday, May 2, 2016.

Ive played many hours of poker throughout the years and spent plenty of money on rooms, shows and restaurants.  Ice recently returned to play in the poker room that is about to close for good. Ive spent lots of time at mgm properties playing poker recently and throught the years. I recently was upgraded at monte carlo sister property to pearl which I certainly deserve.  This card had me feel great as I now would be able to park for free as a local.  Ive spent over $100 on parking this year and its very frustrating.   So I go to monte carlo mgm players card desk to get a copy my card when the girl behind the counter besides to look at me funny and say who gave you this card? I told her I learned it from playing poker throughout MGM properties and she told me to hold on and she went in the back to get her boss. The boss comes out and tells me he doesn't see any activity of me playing or getting any tier points. I advised him I am not a slot player but I play a lot of Poker throughout the city almost on a daily basis. The girl behind the counter and her Superior made me feel like I'm a bum off the street which I did not appreciate. I had advised them I do play a lot of play Slots and they made it seem as if you need to play Slots to qualify for anything in this town. This is ridiculous and I am definitely considering boycotting MGM properties based on the Prejudice of poker players whom I'm sure the casino enjoys as they take the rake and as a player do not mind paying as long as we feel appreciated at least a little bit to get some free parking at minimal. I've been a diamond card member at Harrah's properties a gold member at Venetian a platinum member at cosmopolitan in the past has I used to play this all the time.

Pros:
Ease of parking: The parking lot is located right next to the lobby. You won't have to drag your luggage through miles and miles of casinos to check in.

Ease of getting to your room:  After check in, you walk a few feet and end up at the room elevators. It was super convienent. 

Food court:  There is a Starbucks just steps from the elevators so you can stumble down there for your morning cup of wake the hell up.

Friendly staff: The house keepers asked if we needed new towels or the room cleaned, the front desk helped out with a billing issue.

Pool: They have three different pools and tons of seating. We went down on a busy Saturday and were still able to find a recliner in the sun. We did the lazy river ( you can rent a tube) and then moved over to the wave pool which was way more fun. They had beach balls being tossed around, pumped up music and tons people having a great time.

Cons:

Old rooms: The rooms could use some serious updatng. The beds were pretty dated, plan on waking up with a sore back. The carpets and chairs had staining. There isn't a convient plug anywhere in the room itself.

Room cleanliness: When walked into our room we couldn't get a light to work, bulbs burned out. The bathroom has no fan so you get no privacy and if you take a hot shower....prepare to suffocate. The shower tile was cracked and could have used some grout cleaning. There were hairs on the floor that didn't belong to us. The little table between the beds had the previous guest's tickets from a show. Makes you wonder if they really cleaned anything.",10,0,1

Upon arriving early for check-in, I went to the restroom first. Marble floors do not mesh well with drips of water. I slipped almost completing a full split! It is not safe at all. They need to keep a watch for that before someone can get seriously injured. We get to our assigned room only to find a family just come out of the room. Honestly, after sitting in a car for 4 hours...do you think anyone needs to deal with this crap? It was ridiculous and inconvenient. Poor management. Finally, when we get to the next room, all I can say was it was A-OK. Old decor, strange patches of cardboard on the walls, and no ventilation in the bathroom. Really not fancy at all. Positive note, excellent air conditioner. 

Service was slow when requesting for extra pillows and towels. It took about an hour later to get what I needed. The free wifi (technically you are paying for in the hotel fees) is as slow as dial up connection. 

The pool as expected was extremely crowded. After getting settled, enjoy the lazy river or wave pool. It helped relieve the heat in the crazy HOT weather. Free towels. There are tubes to rent out, drinks to buy, food to eat, etc.

the POOL has a lazy river!  It's not as long as the ones you might find at MGM, but it is sufficient enough to relax and take a moment away from the busy casino noise.

It was a decent price for the location on the strip. Not as far south as New York, NY but definitely not central either. We probably did spend a pretty penny on cab rides to other hotels for the pool parties and night clubs. 

The hotel wasn't able to give us connecting rooms our first night there but did accommodate us the remaining 3 nights so that was nice of them. We did pay for the rooms on higher floors which we got but the view was terrible. We stared basically at the construction site next door to the hotel. NOT IMPRESSED.

My boyfriend booked this hotel on hotels.com for a fairly decent price for two nights...just under 400...which wasn't too bad for a tues\/wed stay...everything else was booked so we didn't have much of a choice. But from the second we checked in it was nothing but a downhill slope. When we checked in the front desk attendant charged us another $200 for resort fees and for the specified room with a king bed? Which wouldn't be so bad if we were paying for the luxury, but I have stayed in Motel 6's in the middle of Iowa that are nicer than this hotel. 

As soon as we got to our room...which ended up to be around 600 for 2 nights instead of the 400 we had agreed to pay :( The FIRST room we checked into had broken tiles in the bathroom that my boyfriend had to sweep to a corner so we wouldn't step on them and cut our feet, and the shower head was busted. There was also no mini fridge? Strange for a Vegas hotel for this price?

After speaking to the front desk they moved us to another room...and promised to bring up a portable mini fridge. It was the same exact room...but with 2 queen beds instead of one King...just down the hall. After waiting for almost 30 minutes for them to bring us new room keys, we were on our way to our ""new"" room. When we arrived the portable fridge was not there and we had to call to again to remind them to bring the fridge up to us. Another 30 minutes passed before our HOT fridge was brought up to us. We plugged it in and had to wait overnight for it to become cool. 

To make matters worse when i called to ask for the pool hours i was informed there is no pool, but we have ""free"" access to the MGM or Mandalay Bay. (what do the resort fees cover then if there is no pool here?) The MGM is about a half mile walk (about 10 min), while the Mandalay is much further (about a 25 min walk). I have never been to a hotel with NO POOL and NO MINI FRIDGE in the room!

They also charge $13\/day for parking, last time we stayed at the Mandalay and it was free with our stay. They seem to be big fans off hidden\/added fees.

Very disappointed in the standard of this hotel, clearly needs some TLC.

Overall, not a bad choice given the deal that we purchased through Hawaiian airlines (room was less than $100 a night and came with a $60\/day credit to be used for food). The Buffet isn't the best eating establishment by a long shot, BUT it is free with the stay. I had to keep reminding myself of this fact when some of the food on the bar literally looked inedible.  

The room was quite comfortable, although quite dated.  Even though we had requested a room with a king-sized bed, a room with two queen beds was available for early check in at 9am at NO additional cost (the King was NOT)...... sign me up for two queen beds please.

The beds were great and my wife especially loved the pillows (would love to find out where one can buy these).

There's a thermostat in the room so adjusting the temperature to a more comfortable level was extremely easy.

The shower was good, yet the water (to me) didn't quite get hot enough, but my wife was happy with its temperature. 

Very quiet considering the age of the hotel and the number of guests it accommodates.

The Casino itself was VERY small in comparison to other casinos throughout the strip.  Limited gaming tables with manageable limits.  The Paigow tables were rarely below a $25 per hand minimum and there was a very noticeable lack of other gaming options for the frugal gambler.  Hell, it might have just been because it was the weekend.

There were two (2) Starbucks in the hotel, one right outside of the room elevators, and the second in the mall on the way to the tram station. 

The tram station is a great convenience if you want to go to the Bellagio, Aria, Crystals or The Vdara hotels.  

SUPER SMOKY !!!! This is to be expected in older hotel\/casinos that don't have updated ventilation systems.  Surprisingly, there ARE seven (7) hotels in Vegas that are smoke-free.

There is a good buffet on the casino floor, as well as a food court. So there are good eating options, without having to step outside, if you need to get something to eat. And of course, if you want to gamble, there are plenty of options there, as expected in any casino in Las Vegas.

While it does not really stand out, compared to other casinos, in terms of architecture or attractions, I think it does have one of the best locations on the Strip. So in either direction, it is not too far of a walk, or bus ride to get to the other casinos, if wanting to check out the attractions or shows at those places.

Our hotel room was the average hotel room- really comfortable bed, nice bathroom. We payed $159 for a Sat night and $89 for Sunday. 
I did get to go to the pool and really liked the lazy river- but the pool area was too small for all of the moms and kids that were over crowding the place.

The housekeeper told us straight up that all of the sheets she had were stained but she would do her best to put the cleanest sheets on the bottom layer where we'd be sleeping.

The gum in the trashcan was really the last straw, so we checked out immediately. The hotel staff is great and handled everything as well as they could, so they deserve a lot of credit.

I like that for the strip, you can usually get a $10 blackjack table and I've even seen $5 on off hours.  The pool area is good with a wave pool and a lazy river.  Restaurants not so much, but you can go elsewhere to eat, and I find that the best restaurants are off the strip anyway... Lotus of Siam, Weiss' Deli, Bachi Burger, Grimaldi's Pizza.  Unfortunately this last time, my buddy got sick and we spent a lot of time hanging out in the room.  This is not where the Monte Carlo shines, unless you are in one of the penthouse floors with a strip view.

Just your normal room is very basic and since it was NCAA March Madness time, the place was full.  Our room was on a lower floor (14) and kind of old looking.  Our first room had beds so soft that I swear they were 20 year old mattresses and the room smelled like it hadn't been opened in a while.  They switched us right away, when I complained and the new room a few doors down was only a little better.  The next morning we went to make coffee and, the coffee machine had mold growing in it where you put the water.  Glad my friend checked, I never would have.  Who knows how many other people hadn't.  Apparently there was something wrong with the lock on the door and maintenance just showed up unannounced saying something was showing up as ""not locking"" on their switch board.  Hmm was that like that all night?  I guess so.  A day later, the kick plate of the door came completely off with screws sticking out.  

Seems to me, this part of the hotel is beyond old and run down.  All Low Def TV stations, even though it's an HDTV.  WIRED internet?  Who uses wired internet anymore?  What is this Y2K?  Our iPads were useless.  Having to just use my iPhone for internet, the 3G was very spotty on this floor and even calls were getting dropped.   I know these high end casinos on the strip don't want you to stay in your room very much, so it's not an accident they don't have your basic comforts that a normal Days Inn has, And you are in Vegas, you SHOULD get out of the room.  But since my friend didn't feel well and I wanted to spend time hanging out with him,  It just really brought to light what a crappy room the Monte Carlo has.

Check-in was smooth as everyone else has said, but room was serviced only once in 5 days (after the first night).  I called at 7:00pm my third night to have the beds made and the trash emptied while out for the evening, the person on the phone was friendly, but when I returned to the room at 8:00am nothing had been done.

Had to physically cut in front of a receptionist and ask to be checked out after a 20 minute wait. Had a long distance phone call on my bill which I was told could not be contested.

I'm staying in a Monacco suite, but I think that next time I would rather just stay in a high floor strip view room. THE PROS: It has an entrance right on the strip. It has a tram that connects it to Aria and Bellagio. There are a lot of places to eat that are right inside the hotel. There are a lot of places with happy hours right inside the hotel. It is connected to Crystal center for some high-end shopping. If you leave housekeeping a note, like I want more towels, they will leave more towels. If you call down to the front desk and need something they respond promptly. The gym is included in your resort fee and it is beautiful. In my opinion the place is clean and the staff is friendly. THE CONS: The walls are thin and the Monacco suite that I am in butts up against the wall holding the elevator, another room's bathroom,  I can hear the conversations everyone is having as they get off of the elevator, and I can hear luggage being dragged over tiles...click click click...you get the idea ( I believe that a regular room would not be as noisy, the location of the suites is just unfortunate ). The shower heads are like pressure washers (not really a con if you like good water pressure). There is no wireless internet, but the wired internet is fast and free. MY SUGGESTIONS: Book a regular room with a strip view instead of going for a suite. Bring a case of bottled water with you. Let housekeeping clean your room every day you stay so that you are sure to get your coffee, bottled water, and towels without having to get them yourself. Leave a note for housekeeping if you need something extra. Check-in at 3pm is a little crazy, it is like that every day, so relax and be prepared to be in line for a while.",0,0,0

So, I went through priceline and got this hotel for around $70 (tax included) and was thinking, sure, the location is great and it's a 4 star.  Please don't be fooled, it's worse that many of the branded motels I've stayed before.  We paid an extra $55 to get a bigger room with 2 bathrooms and a jacuzzi.  Then the front desk tells us we need to pay an additional $15 for their club usage and internet. (which we don't use or need) So total around $140\/night. When we came up to the room, it was old looking and NO amenities what so ever!  Eg. Cups, kettle, coffee machine, water bottle, microwave no where to be found etc..etc.  So we are Asian and we're used to drinking hot tea or hot water in the morning.  So we asked housekeeping whether they can get us a kettle.  ""sorry, we don't have kettles. I'll transfer you to room service"".  okay...so I spoke with them and asked for some hot water and two cups.  They said ""sure, but it'll be $4.50"".  So you can see why we did not have a pleasant stay here.  Also, the bed sheets had holes in it!!! 

We moved to PH tower westgate the next day and wow...what a change.  4 star as well, mini suite with a jacuzzi, much newer room, nicely decorated, bigger windows and has all the amenities listed above, kitchenware and even a dishwasher.   The total price was $25 cheaper.  I'm just disappointed that a 4 star hotel can't even afford a kettle for each room.  And they had to cheat us with the $15 additional resort fee when we check in.

But that wasn't the first time I've ever been in Monte Carlo. In fact, I've been in the place many times. My aunt worked here for a few years after she left the Stardust actually. 

I remember the grand statues and landscaping out front. I remember the arcade in the lame shopping mall in the back. I remember when Lance Burton was the headliner and the bizarre sub-theme of magic the place once had. I remember when it wasn't so red and blue. 

The grand entrance has been replaced with a Linq-ish promenade (my feelings on that are rather ambivalent). The arcade in the back is gone, making the ""Street of Dreams"" even more underwhelming. The magic theme has been replaced with the aura of the Blue Man Group. 

The hotel room was lovely however. 

It decorated in muted nighttime shades of blue on the walls and in the carpet. The bed was plush and spacious enough for multiple people to lay on it during a gathering. There were two bathrooms (this was a suite) which was perfect for a party environment. Oh, and we were able to accommodate almost 50 people in our one room.

Not bad for a party. Not bad at all.

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Fantastic, spacious suites.
It kinda, sorta serves as a childhood memory? LOL. 

Cons:
""Eh"" casino and shopping area.

Huh?:
Okay, I get you guys are trying to blend the entrance in with the new ""Park"" for the arena and everything, but at the same time by remodeling the entrance y'all kinda took away the only thing that really made the facade distinctive. Now it kinda just looks a bunch of other places on The Strip. Oh wait, that's the point. Never mind.

I got there at night and check-in was a breeze.  No line and was in my room in around 10 minutes.

The room itself was nothing special.  Modern decor and it was clean.  One complaint was the toilet in the bathroom sounded like a jet engine when flushing and when you turned on the water in the sink it would splash all over the place unless you were careful.  Another minor issue was that the room door wouldn't open at times and I would have to insert the key a half a dozen times or so to get it to open.  Kinda annoying but not a deal breaker.  There's no Wi-Fi available, but wired internet service is available and included in the $15 a day resort fee.  

The casino is of decent size and during the day they have $5 blackjack tables which were nice.  At night the tables were $10 or higher.

A plus to staying here is that there is a tram at the Monte Carlo which goes to the Aria, CityCenter and Bellagio.  It's nice to have when its 100 degrees outside.  The location on the strip is pretty good as well.  It's near the center and there's a CVS right next door and a Walgreens across the boulevard.",0,0,0

The rooms were clean, and I really liked how I could walk out of the self-parking garage directly to the lobby w\/ elevators so I could go up to my room. That was something special to me. They have Keurigs in the rooms, but the coffee tastes expired. The bottled water is part of your resort fee - speaking of which, I had a comp night here and the guy who checked me in handed me back my card and told me he wasn't even going to charge the resort fee. Kudos, shout outs, and thumbs up.

I didn't explore any of the hotel at all, instead, just spending the night here. It's definitely an older hotel and it's rather dated, especially in the rooms and corridors.

When I got into the room, the first thing I did was look at my view.  Imagine my disappoint when I saw a parking lot and 15 fwy.  Not happy, I went back down to check-in to get this resolved.  The assistant tried to tell me that when their is a ""view"" it will only show a ""V.""  Not my problem seeing that I requested and PAID FOR a strip view.

He assigned me another room.  I asked to see a map of the rooms so I could verify that I would have a strip view.  He did not have a map, he asked another associate... they didn't have a map.  No one seemed to have a map readily available.  Finally he finds a map and we confirm the room has a strip view.

It was a standard room with the basics.  However, the sheets did not fit the mattress.  It was as though they put king sized sheets on a queen. And the sheets made noise when you moved.  I can't describe what it sounded like.

Checking in was fine, the staff was pleasant even though it was super busy. Everything went sour after we got to our room however. First off, one of our lamps was completely broken and the other lamp flickered enough that it could have been used to create a mini rave. There were barely any towels in our room and the cups left for us were dirty. 

We dropped our bags off and left to go back to the car to get the rest of our stuff. Once we returned to our room, a strange man was inside by the television claiming that he was called to fix the bathtub. We told him that we never called because we had just checked in. He left and we called house keeping to get more towels and ask about the maintenance. The lady from house keeping said she'd send more towels and that she has no knowledge regarding the maintenance because that is not her department. We were expecting the towels to take around 40 minutes to arrive, from experience because my group of friends and I go to Vegas every month. It took about three hours for the towels to arrive and they forgot to bring new cups for us. 

I forgot about this issue until my friend reminded me, but our television did not work. We would turn the tv on and the remote would not change the channel and the volume would go up and down on its own. We called to have the TV looked at and it took a few hours for someone to come and fix it. 
 
We also ordered room service and asked to use our resort credit to pay for is. However, it was charged to my credit card instead and they charged us for items that we not only did not order, but we also did not receive them.  

My friends and I decided to speak with a manager regarding the issues that we were having with the room and while the managers were friendly, they were unhelpful. Half of our trip was calling and waiting for someone to remedy the issues that we were having with our room. Being summer, I know that the hotel was fully booked and busy, but the delay of service exceeded any excuse and went into poor time management.  I also received a random bill for $61 a month after we checked out via mail. I called the number on the bill and the only options were for automated messages, I could not get a hold of an actual person. The bill also did not state how I was supposed to pay the bill. I sent them an email to request an invoice and received a message that I would receive the invoice in three days. A week later, I still had not received anything and so I sent another email with my check out folio attached to email, which stated that I did not owe anything. I asked for a detailed invoice and after another month, I received my original folio that stated I owed nothing. I asked them why I received this bill and then they sent me a random invoice that had the date I sent the email with $61 dollars on it and nothing else. I asked them where this amount came from a did not receive a response. I had emailed and called the representative that emailed me several times for weeks and then I received a collections notice stating that Monte Carlo has sent my account to collections because they ""could not"" contact me.

I stayed here during good friday weekend with a couple of friends (yeah I know we are sinners) and it couldn't have been better. We arrived at the hotel at 6AM despite knowing check-in was at 3PM. We were so tired from our trip so we asked the lady in the front desk how much would it be to check-in early she said the hotel does not charge a fee for early check-in (According to the receptionist the website only says 30 dollar fee just as a window so people wont ask for early check-ins). She was so generous and let us check-in to both rooms we had reserved. Over all i love Monte Carlo because of its location, everything is so close and the service is awesome. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the hotel only has wifi in the lobby and in the pool side but unfortunately the rooms have no wifi which sucks. :(",5,0,1

This time though the rooms were clean but they definitely need to start maintenance on them! They are starting to look worn. There was construction right outside, so with all the noise it was distracting and I was woken early! 

The water drained slow in the shower. I mentioned at check out but the guy who helped us didn't seem to care. He did apologize but there was no genuine tone to it. 

The bed was not comfy and I think it also has to do with the fact that they really need to update the rooms

I kindly asked her why she was not wanting to credit the charges back if we already paid for it .. she kept on repeating herself.. and I kept on saying I understand, you have already said that my room comes with parking ... however my fiancé had parked the car prior to checking in and he has been paying your hotel with his master card .
Here is the receipt...
She now has major attitude, then tells me she is willing to credit back one time charge. 
I asked her .. why would you not credit back both charges? We obviously both paid.. you have receipts.. 
then she says I will go ahead and credit back both, but not being nice. Just because your saying thank you, does not mean your nice it's How you Say it.. 
Then she says My name is AMY, incase  you need it.. 
Why would you give me your name is I did not ask?? Amy: you are Very Very rude. Merry xmas to you too on Xmas day.

And everything in between. But this was my first time staying at Monte Carlo (I had gambled there before however). Here is what I found: Check in (arrived at 1:15 pm) fast and friendly. Room would not  be ready till 3 (and it was).  

Stayed in the Monaco Suite. Was very happy. Huge non-smoking room of about 700-800 sq. ft., sitting\/couch area, flat screen TV, breakfast\/dining area by the window, mini-fridge, 1.5 marble bathrooms, 2 thick terry robes, bar area (non-stocked) all for $250 (tax and resort fee included) Sat and Sunday night stay. The decor was adequate and relaxed. Some nicks on the furniture and one small burn on the carpet but overall a very comfortable, clean and well appointed room-even had 3 beautiful glass vases on the bar. The bed was amazingly comfortable! Was initially worried about noise because the door to our room opened to the main area that everyone spilled into from the elevator. However, we didn't hear a peep. BONUS! 

The 2 for 1's FLOW at the MC! We basically did a ""bar crawl"" enjoying the 2 for 1's at ""dVino"", Brand and The Pub in Monte Carlo. Got a 2 for 1 buffet (not a fan of buffets in general so we ate breakfast there-not bad). 

The casino: kicked my butt in blackjack ($10 min table) where my bet ranged from $15-$25 a hand.  Won a little back in craps. MC has added a ""party pit"" type area (next to the new minus 5 degree lounge) where a dancer (think stripper before the stripping takes place) performs as you play blackjack or other table games. Kind of a gambler's ""pervert row"", not that there's anything wrong with that! Overall an upscale and pleasant environment.

The pool: I am used to larger (Mandalay Bay to be specific) but this pool was nice. I would like to see more cabanas available. Love any lazy river and MC's is perfectly fine. Not huge (like MGM's) but nice.

Location: Not a lot has to be said here. FANTASTIC. Tram or leisurely walk to Aria (where my girlfriend enjoyed a massage and spent the entire day at the spa) where we ate twice and I gambled some. Crystals at City Center shopping is top shelf  (girlfriend tried on a $24,000 vest) and has art throughout the property. Tram to Bellagio (though I've been using it for years) is fast, clean and always appreciated after all the walking.    

Checkout was flawless (even got a late checkout @ 1:00). Bellman and luggage stowage was also smooth. 

OVERALL I was extremely happy with Monte Carlo and will stay there again. I would stay there in December when I go back, however, I have 3 comped nights at the Palms. But after that, MC here I come!",1,0,0

On 12\/31\/15 around 6pm after going out for dinner, we went to our room and  the room smells of pot. We complained via phone as well as with housekeeping and then housekeeping said to go to front desk complain. We went to the front desk at around 7pm and was told that we should have called housekeeping to have a ozone machine brought to the room. I told them that housekeeping told us to go to front desk. Then the guy at the front desk said, let me check if there was a request. He stated to give around 2 hrs to have ozone machine to purify room. We went to the room at 830pm. No ozone machine was even brought in. So we head back to the front desk again to complain!!! Now the last at the front desk double checked and stated that someone came in to check the room but didn't know where the smell coming from. They said it may be with the connecting room but I know for a fact it's not them because they are all non- smokers much more potsmokers because they are my aunts!!! Then I asked them when do they plan on bringing in the ozone machine since I didn't even see the machine in the room and it smelled worst!!! She said let me put in another request to make sure, housekeeping is a bit busy tonight. I asked how long it will take, she said about 45 mins.
We waited again, after 30 mins and back to the room, still nothing!!! We went to the VIP concierge person who tried assisting us and stated that he did see 2 request and security came by and stated that he did smell it at the hall inside our room but once he got in the room he stated it doesn't smell as bad anymore. 
The hotel is supposedly a non smoking hotel. Guest services is definitely is lacking here. If I can do zero star, I would!!!!
So after talking to the security, he suggested to wait for about an hour for housekeeping to bring the ozone machine. We waited for 30 mins to see if they even brought in the machine. Guess what? NO OZONE MACHINE AT ALL!!! We tried opening the window but it opens up to half an inch only. I opened our door so that the smell comes out of our room. BF closed the bathroom door he thinks it might be coming from the bathroom vent. Past 1230am 1\/1\/16, I went to our bathroom. And the stench in the bathroom was so strong!!! Again, the smell of marijuana aka weed aka pot is permeating from the bathroom VENT!!!! BF called front desk again. BF talked to them and complain once more even stated that they have promised to send out ozone machine for the 3rd time already but no one came. BF stated we can't be staying in this room since we have allergies and I have severe asthma, he has condition that may cause to have seizures. He even told them it's coming off from the bathroom vent. They promised that someone will come in to check it out within a few minutes. BF waited for more than an hour but no one came in at all. Not even to check on us.
No one came to purify the air!!! We ended up putting towels 2 big towels at the bottom of our bathroom door so that the smell wont leak out to our room.  At around 9am we talked to housekeeping and told her about the bathroom cause someone was definitely smoking some pot again and its pretty strong. She called her supervisor who also checked and did smell the scent again. Then they ask if we want to have ozone machine be put. But we have to be out of the room for another 2 hours, same excuse. I told them we just want a different room. I was coughing all night didn't have enough rest. My asthma was acting up. My BF has serious allergic reaction rashes all over his body. Any room is fine as long as we don't smell pot. This was by far a nightmare New Year's Eve vacation!!! I wouldn't think of this Hotel as HOTEL but more of a MOTEL or a hotel in a seedy part of neighborhood were its ok for people to smoke pot. This place is a DUMP!!!
So definitely this hotel is not suitable for people who have allergies, asthma, epilepsy or children!!! Stay at your own risk!!!
Plus remote control for tv not working!!!
Now, the kicker, we checked out a day early because of both of us getting sick from their rooms. The bills were not visible on TV, have to go to front desk and try to settle the account there. The front desk said, I see that you're leaving a day early, did anyone explained to you that if you checked out a day early that you have to pay the whole 5 days. I said no one explained to me. I am pretty sure that we have complained so much that it is noted there already. Such audacity, paying for leaving early when we got sick because of the state of their room and the inability to take action to our complaints. And then kind of said well since no one explained to you about it, will just waive it..",3,2,1

First, they did not tell us that the pool was under construction. You will have to leave to go to either MGM or Mandalay to use their pools. Also, the customer service is a joke. Everyone we seemed to deal with from the minute we stepped inside was extremely rude. 

Now let's get to the room. My friends and I had adjoining rooms for my bachelorette. In one of the rooms, the toilet seat wasn't even attached to the toilet. We had to call someone to reinstall the seat. The bedding was ripped and old. The smell was musty and the air conditioner was broken. There was a stain on the ceiling that looked like someone may or may not have been murdered. We got major attitude when we called to fix the toilet and the air. After over an hour had passed, we called again and they snapped and said we had only called 7 minutes prior. Either they confused us with someone else or aren't sure how to read a clock. 

My last issue is with the buffet. A friend of mine JUST got stomach surgery and has not yet received her card that allows her to eat kids meals in restaurants due to the fact that she now eats very little. We asked the manager at the buffet if she could order the kids buffet since she eats about 5 bites for a meal. It was only about $3 less than the adult buffet. The manager was unsympathetic and didn't care and told her if she doesn't have the card, she has to pay the adult price. So they lost $100 of business because they were stingy about $3. We took our business elsewhere with better customer service. 

In conclusion, the only thing this hotel has going for it is the location. Aside from that,this place is crap. It's gone downhill so much. We will never stay here again. I highly suggest booking a different hotel.",5,1,1

My old guide book has it rated higher than the Mandalay Bay with its single zero roulette, microbrews, tennis courts, and direct line to the Bellagio. So now that that's all history, what's to like? Well...
It's compact - the front desk, rooms, restaurants, and pool are close together, and it's easy to get through the casino to the strip. 
Nice casino - I found good rules (dealer stands on all 17s - couldn't even find these downtown!), had a bunch of fun with the dealer, never had to wait for a drink, and they seemed glad to buy my breakfast.
Cheap rooms - yeah the regular rooms may be getting a little run down...so get a suite. They're inexpensive and comfortable. 
Good choice of food - The pub is still fine without the home made brews, the Sunday brunch buffet was incredible, they have one of the top gourmet rooms, and the fast food court provides a nice alternative. New additions are a nice looking steakhouse in the old lounge and a fun open air cantina on the strip.
I've seen some bad reviews and I don't think it's time to write off the Monte Carlo just yet. It's true that it's suffering a bit from the construction next door (the pool speakers to cover up the noise, the strange view) and there's still some maintenance to be done, but the staff were friendly and we had a great time here.

We're born and raised here and have never been inside here before and decided to give it a try.  We stayed from 1\/27-1\/29, so a week ago.

We stayed in their Monaco Suite.  What made me pick that room was the giant bathtub they described in the description, and I've been craving a bath from all the stress at work.  When we walk in, it looked very nice and clean.  Of course upon closer inspection there are some scratches, dents, black marks, dust, etc.  It didn't bother me too much so that was that.  But yes, from what most of the reviews said, they really need to renovate the rooms.  Unfortunately, the bathtub wasn't as big as I imagined it would be, but it still was way bigger than what's in my own house.  And one of the room keys they gave us didn't work, odd..

So basically to sum it down:

Pros
- Casino smells fresh, I did not smell any ash tray (for those non-smokers out there)
- Front desk\/Concierge were very friendly and helpful
- Walkway to all the shops was nice
- Room is 80% clean
- Bed was very comfy and soft

Cons
- The Cafe in the hotel has horrible service, took us 3 times to ask for a frickin to-go box and a different server gave it to us!  Our server ignored us for almost the whole time we dined. Unprofessional, we tipped the server who gave us the to-go box.  His expression was priceless haha.
- Room does have chipped off wood, black skid marks on walls and lampshade, pillow had few black marks, dusty counter top, wallpaper coming off, etc..
- The couch was rock hard, I sat on the bed when I watched a little bit of TV.
- Our room came with free WiFi, but even then the connection was shit.
- I did find a few hairs in the showers

Overall, I did enjoy my stay.  But in terms of coming back to stay?  Nope haha.  I will visit the Casino again but not to stay =D",1,0,0

The casino sucks. The drinks are expensive. The only reason we stayed here is because we waited too long to book for SEMA, and we immediately regretted it. If you want an enjoyable hotel experience don't stay here.",2,1,0

for our Valentine's 3-day weekend vacay :]

CHECK-IN
The girl that helped us check-in was a robot.
I swear.
She talked to us like she was reading something off a book.
I mean.. I know that's what they do all day..
and they say the same thing over and over and over again..
but that's still not a good enough reason for her to make us feel so
unwelcome.. yano?
She did give us a nice room close to the elevators though..

ROOM
Now.. this is coming from a girl who's only been to Vegas
ONCE before.. and that first time at Vegas was @ Stratosphere..
so this hotel room http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5iSmZO0SrKU6EoXK_1M8Kw?select=ze4hUrlQAzAm11lSMlOZMA (eventhough it's the basic one)
was nice.. especially the bathroom x]
Don't ask why we got 2 beds (ones for sleeping.. ones for ___ [you can fill it in] Im j\/m :P)
Room service was quick..
we found out later that one of the bedsheet on our bed had
some.. brown stains on it.. not ONE but THREE different spots!
euwww?? 
So we complained to the front desk
and they fixed it for us right away.
We had to call room service to get new towels too..
all their towels smelled like.. burnt toast O.o weird..

CASINO
highlight of our vacay!
My hubby accidentally pushed one of the buttons on the slot
and came up with $300 lmao.
Lotsa fuzzy navels and pina colada for meee~ weee~ :D

CAFE
open 24 hours..
we got hungry at like 2am..
went to the cafe and grabbed their 
16oz. rib eye http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5iSmZO0SrKU6EoXK_1M8Kw?select=OF0AjNqudev9gKC6V4R4yA for $19.99..
and breakfast http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5iSmZO0SrKU6EoXK_1M8Kw?select=am4eZUVzJ54wRR3FEl_OcQ
There was only one server
so it took a while to get our order in..
but it was so worth the wait :]
+ she gave drinks for free.

BUFFET
We got this comped..
So we came for breakfast..
ate lots and lots of bacon http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5iSmZO0SrKU6EoXK_1M8Kw?select=Qaf9d_VN4Qipzhfp7SFruQ,
ham, scrambled eggs, pancake, waffle, sausages,
country fried steaks, corn hash, grits,
danish (this was nasty.. like the dough wasn't folded enough),
muffins (blueberry!! yummm),
and omelets made to order http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/5iSmZO0SrKU6EoXK_1M8Kw?select=Qaf9d_VN4Qipzhfp7SFruQ. :]

After this experience we will not waste our money on a place that their staff has stolen from us, our jackets, and provided the worst possible uncaring, stressful and disgusting stay environment possible. We understand it is a business and you are only concerned about the money aspect, you personified the term capitalism. So we do understand your business model of ""money first, money second, money always, customer never"". That is just not conducive to our vacation plans. As a retired veteran I have worked very hard and sacrificed a lot over the years and this anniversary was the first my wife and I have had in thirty years, and this was what we received. You live and learn and we definitely learned what the Monte Carlo was about. I hope no one else ever has the same experience\/disaster that we had to endure, that is why we left early.

I booked for two nights at the Monte Carlo... I was excited to know that as an ""adult"" I can now book for my dream hotel in Vegas.

We got there, and the first thing the person told me at the front desk was that they no longer had non smoking rooms available. Hold on, I BOOKED your hotel and made a reservation and specifically picked ""NON SMOKING."" How do you NOT have these rooms available?

So the first night I had to stay at a damn room that smelled like death. Mind you I have asthma... and was going through an asthma attack the week prior to staying at the Monte Carlo.

Oh ALSO, according to Hotels.com, Monte Carlo says they have free wi-fi. Well, how come I wasn't able to log onto the internet? The lady at the front desk told me that THEY ONLY OFFERED WI-FI for the first and second floor! 

I needed the internet for business, and yet I had no access to that. 

Luckily they granted me a different room the next day but still I made a damn reservation for a non-smoking room.

Wave pool, regular pools, lazy river:  rent an intertube and have the time of your life.    Tube rental was cheap.  If you go toward the end of the day it is highly discounted.  Sometimes people will just give them to you as they leave too.

Room was far smaller than Excalibur, but it was plenty big enough for everyone.  Really nice view.  Room was worn and a number of things were in disrepair.  (Furniture was broken; things in bathroom were broken.)

Cleanliness was an issue.  There was icky stuff on the wallpaper in the bathroom.  Looked like someone puked in there many, many times and no one had ever actually took the time to clean it.  That was the worst of the cleanliness issues, but there were many others, mostly small stuff.

I have to say I have always been happy with my experience here but this last time was way below expectations. The resort fee has gone up to $28 a night, this is a bit ridiculous if you ask me, before the fee was about $20, still wasn't happy then but didn't mind paying the fee as my room included a coffee machine and 2 bottles of water......now the Fee is $28 a night and there is no coffee machine or bottled water? I also noticed that the hotel is now beginning to show its age in the carpet, I stayed on the 28th floor and the carpet was literally rippling, I observed a couple walking and the female companion almost tripped on the carpet. The beds are also worn including the sheets and furniture. 

I planned on returning next month for a mini vacation but will opt out staying here. For what I will pay I am better off staying local in San Diego or some other place where my nightly fee will not include a resort fee and the condition of the hotel warrants the price being charged.

If you want a spot at the pool on the weekends, be sure to head down there early. The lazy river gets jammed with people standing and socializing around noon, so if you want to take a lap on a tube on the weekends, also be sure to get that in right when you get there. 

Having McDonald's for coffee and a breakfast sandwich in the morning was awesome to start the day of right. You can't bring food into the pool because they sell some inside, but you can bring your coffee!

My friend and I will never come back here nor will we suggest it. We ended up getting moved to one of their sister hotels after 4 room changes (due to quality and cleanliness) and rude staff. Although much of the staff was in fact pleasant, it only takes one to ruin your experience. 

My friend (handicapped) and I were planning on staying there and sitting by the pool and in the lazy river. We arrive to learn that the entire pool area is under construction and it is a 30 minute walk to the MGM pool area that we would be allowed to have access to. My friend can not walk that much, PLUS we should have been notified of the changing facilities, especially since we booked back in November 2016. 

ROOM 1: When we got to our first room, it smelled musky and there was a soaking wet, dirty, towel on the nightstand table and we were overlooking the pool area construction. 

ROOM 2: We arrived at our second room, it reeked of cigarette smoke! We understand that smoking is allowed in the casino and on certain floors but this was a non-smoking floor and room and someone had clearly just smoked a cigarette in the room. 

ROOM 3: They moved us to the third room, which was now on a lower floor, and wallpaper was peeling off of the walls and there was a heavy deodorizer smell filling the room. Even the bellhop said he had never seen a room in that condition.

ROOM 4: At this final room, yet an even lower floor, we were beat. There were cigarette holes in the curtains (a non-smoking room), and the bathroom was dirty. We had to have housekeeping come to the room and re-clean the bathroom. There was makeup on the bedding, mildew on the bathroom faucets, and the sink didn't drain. When the maids came in to clean, I was sleeping (my friend was handling the moves at this point), and the maid used the phone ON SPEAKER to clock out! It gave the wrong dial tone sound multiple times, she kept trying, and eventually woke me up. So rude and unprofessional. We didn't sleep well that night either since the walls are paper thin and we heard our neighbors fighting all night.

During the room changes, they forgot to bring us our new keys so we were stuck waiting in the room. A manager forgot to call us back so we were also just waiting in the room on them. One manager (I believe Octavio) was extremely rude to us telling us he couldn't move us out of the dirty rooms, which of course later he did.

It took so long to get checked into our room (we arrived at 4pm) that we missed the gym hours, which we came dressed to hit up. We went to the gym in the morning and the facilities were okay. No bosu ball. There was someone in there cleaning the entire time but he just kept vacuuming and kind of ruining the vibe. People leave their towels all over the place and don't clean the machines. Funny how the cleaner was in there for our entire 1.5 hour workout yet never cleaned up the random towels.

There were stains on virtually every soft surface - carpeting, the chairs (both in the room and by the elevator on our floor), even the towels.
The only good thing I can say is that we didn't pay much.  The total was about $100 per night and there were 3 of us in the room.  This included the booking through Expedia and the $20 resort fee charged for each day.
I truly hope the people who have paid full freight get better, cleaner rooms.

PROS:
Fairly inexpensive for The Strip.
Pretty speedy service, except at the front desk.
Very professional bartenders.
CONS:
Awful bathrooms - mold in the tub area, no exhaust fan, no bath mat the first 2 days, no light in the shower some kind of residue on the glasses.
At check-in, many desks, few people working.  Stood in line 30 minutes.
Very little natural light anywhere in the hotel.
Worn mattresses.
WiFi in the lobby and food court only, did not work very well.
Stains EVERYWHERE.  There were several chairs in the elevator area on our floor and every single one of them looked like it had been peed on (or worse).
The online tool for checking your bill was cumbersome.

If you're not looking to party during the day, Monte Carlo has a great (albeit crowded) pool area! When we came in November it was open 9am-4pm, but hours are extended in the summer. 

Check-in had a pretty long line (we had to wait 20-30 minutes around 3:30pm), but after having endured an hour-long wait the night before at Flamingo, 30 minutes seems like nothing. 

In the rooms, you get the bare minimum. TV, outlets, bathroom, and everything is clean. There was no fridge, coffee maker, etc. Our room was directly facing some construction going on near the strip, so it was a bit noisy during the day. Fortunately we weren't inside our room much, because VEGAS! 

Location is great -- about a 10-minute walk to MGM Grand (closest Fat Tuesday), and 15-minute walk to Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile Shops (second closest Fat Tuesday, ha!). There's a food court located downstairs right next to the pool entrance, including cheap options like McDonald's and Rubio's -- great for travelers on a budget! 

NOTE: If you're booking through hotels.com, make sure you book all rooms under the name of whoever is checking in.

We have stayed at the Monte Carlo several times and made reservations there this time for our anniversary. It was shown that if we upgraded our room, we would receive 2 complimentary buffets. So, we upgraded our room. The hotel is scheduled to be renovated for 240 million dollars and change its name. When we inquired about the complimentary buffets, we were told we did not qualify. Lots of double talk from one of the managers with no avail. Our thoughts are that perhaps they are reneging on their promotions to fund the renovation. Needless to say, we are disappointed. The only reason they are getting one star instead of a zero is so I can post this and alert others about their misleading promotions.",1,0,0

Say it with me...THIN WALLS!!! I really wanted to like The Monte Carlo. Awesome customer service, friendly housekeeping, charming gold fixtures and old furnitures, but we just couldn't get over how thin the walls were.

1st NIGHT was horrible. Woke up at 3am from the sound of shattered glass and people laughing and screaming out loud. I ain't mad at them. It is VEGAS. 2nd and 3rd NIGHT were just as bad. Right when we were about to sleep at 1am, we heard a baby crying very loud on and off and things being moved around for a good hour. Poor baby was probably sick. In the morning, we heard the shower being turned on every time and people walking and talking outside our room. We've stayed at several hotels on the strip (Trump, MGM, Mandalay Bay, Signature) and we never had this kind of problem. 

However, we did appreciate the cleanliness of our room and bathroom. Our bed was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was clean, no stains on our towels and had the basic things you need in a bathroom. 

For the price, I guess it's okay. We got regular room with a King Bed for $120 a night through Vegas.com. It came with complimentary Buffet for 2 and drinks and Ignite Lounge, which was awesome. But I don't recommend this hotel if you want to get a good sleep.",4,5,1

As far as I know, the room that I stayed in was already renovated.  Which is pretty sad, because overall I was underwhelmed.

Let's start with the public areas.  Right now, they are abysmal.  There is only one combo restaurant \/ bar and a steakhouse available to eat.  The Ignite Bar is horribly smokey as is the entire casino section, far more so than any of the other newer casinos.  My asthma was out of control just walking through.  I would never want to come here for gaming, and there isn't much else to do here.  So pretty much I left the hotel immediately after getting up each day and only came back to sleep.

Everything is ripped up;  carpeting partly there, barricades with a bunch of broken furniture inside them, plaster drywalls everywhere.  It looks like shit.  I get it, they're renovating.  But it's sure not a pleasant relaxing place to be while they do it.

The hallways on my floor (21) sadly were also already renovated. I say sadly because they do not look good.  They fit the ""park"" theme in that there is minimalistic ""grass"" drawn on the walls with these black birds, dragonflies, etc. that from a distance actually look like stains.  It really looks terrible.  The hallways are long, dark and depressing.  I felt more like I was in a hospital than a hotel.

Now for the renovated rooms - after sharing notes with coworkers also staying here, they are all a bit different and some have some interesting touches like changeable mood lighting.  Mine was what I would call partially updated ""Chinatown brothel chic with thriftshop art"".  The bed is a low profile platform bed with a reasonably decent mattress, but since it was just on the platform it was a little harder than I like in total.  But, the pillows and bedding were nice so it was a reasonably decent sleep experience (one of two reasons I bestow a second star).   The walls were red, there was a red velvet couch, a decent sized table with a random thrift shop desk chair.  There was an ugly ceiling lamp with a cord that runs up and down the wall.  Overall the lighting was poor, which doesn't help my knitting habit.  The carpet was clearly NOT upgraded.  It was dingy and old.  At least it was a non-smoking floor.  The thermostat was clearly not correct, I had it set on 70 and was still hot (and I keep it 72 at home).    

The bathroom however I did like.  It was new and clean, with simple white and red decor, new subway tiles and nice fixtures.  (This is second reason for 2nd star).  Basic tub with shower curtain, not fancy, but overall a good bathroom.

For all this, we paid over 100 a night.  And they charge resort fee.  Such a joke.  The only reason I am glad we stayed here was easy access to the Aria, which is lovely.  There is a hallway joining the two hotels so you don't have to walk outside.  I pretty much spent every non-working hour at the Aria.

I'd say wait til they finish renovating the Monte Carlo, but honestly from what I've seen I don't think it will be that great when they finish.  The design choices just don't fit with what I like aside from the bathrooms.",3,1,1

- booked the spring break package deal however ZUMANITY is on break until tuesday april 13th so the main reason we went, wasn't even happening. the night staff was useless and snotty, the morning staff was much more accomidating and comped us 2 buffet meals b.c. they were offering a package that they couldn't follow thru on. STUPID.  be sure to read at the bottom of zumanity's website for the dates in which they are on ""break"" !!!!  

I asked for a room upgrade to a suite but they were all booked. floor 32, top floor. 

- at check in friday night, our king bed request wasnt available so we were stuck with 2 doubles. 31st floor rm 125 - I paid for a delux room, high floor, strip view - this room had a view of the luxor and mandalay bay. not so much a strip view. However, the vaulted cielings were great.

- we relocated saturday to the 30th floor with a king bed. better view of the strip facing planet hollowood\/mgm, but older style room and no vaulted cieling. room 317.  i think we would have been happier with the 31st floor. this room was considerably older and run down and dark. 

- the pool - lazy river was wam, wave pool cold. they ran out of towels and told us it'd be a 30min wait, so we decided to bring our towels down from the room...lame.  a corona was $7. an inner tube rental was almost $10. Bathrooms were clean. Lots of lawn chairs if you arrive by noon otherwise you're out of luck. hip hop & 80's hip hop music playing at the pool. 

- the breakfast buffet meal was $20\/pp. I'm glad we were comp'd b.c. I would have been furious if I had paid full price. the waitstaff was HORRIBLE. took forever to awknowledge we sat down - even after i kept eye-ing them. then took Forever to bring drinks and didn't refill them. it was just rediculous. and to boot - the place wasn't even busy! we went to the 11am brunch.  the food - nothign special. eggs, bacon, sasauge, omlette station, crab legs (microscopic) some carved meat stations, pancakes\/french toast (rubbery with no butter in sight) and pre-packaged syrup pods. Oatmeal with only brown sugar as a  topping - no walnuts, no raisons, no bananas, nothing.  pastires and mini muffins and soft server ice cream.  save your money at eat at dennys. 

- the city center blocks a lot of the views north on the strip and I think the monte carlo is suffering b.c. they have a lot of outdated things ...

My perspective of Las Vegas from the last time I came in 2010 has changed--I am leaving with a heavy heart not because I lost money from gambling but because Vegas is not as fabulous as It was.I stayed in the Palazzo in 2010, and this time, Monte Carlo. There is no comparison. 

The hotel, which we booked from Travelocity, looked so much different from the photos in their website. We didn't read the yelp reviews, I wish we did. The front desk were very friendly of course, we sandwiched $20 hoping we would be given a nicer room, and a view of the strip. The lady gave us a room in the 28th floor, and just like we hoped for, she said a view of the strip.

Coming out of the elevator, There is a musty smell in the hallway, and dirty and old carpet covering the floor. And then our room.....

It's beyond disappointment. I have stayed in nice and not so nice hotels, and I don't understand why Monte Carlo claims that they are a 4 star hotel? We went yo the front desk and we were told there is nothing they can do!

Bathrooms are filthy. I am posting the gross photos. Warning;Gross!
No bath tubs, we are given the handicapped room,non smoking with a tiny bit view of the strip, more of facing the Aria. 
The towels have stains on them.
Bedbugs? Maybe, we went home with rashes.
Carpet, old.

There is nothing about our hotel room that we actually liked, it just kept disappointing us, from the wallpaper, to the cheap hair dryers that hardly dried my hair; except that it includes two free buffet everyday.

The staff, the bell staff are okay, and the guy who calls the taxi cab, since we didn't have any change left at all, so we couldn't tip when we wee leaving, told us that we should tip. We know, but with that attitude? Hmmm....

On Saturday, the clienteles are so much different. I was holding tight on my bag trying to be alert. I felt like I have to be extra alert! and that I am gonna be robbed. But on Sunday, it's more of the older and Midwest visitors arriving. We were about to change hotels and book Aria or Vdara for the next few days but since we saw different clienteles coming in, we decided to stay, and that also we are told by travelocity that we cannot refund the remaining two days.

The buffet may be the best part of the hotel, only because it's included in our package deal. The waiter was very polite. And although it's a buffet, we still happily left a 20% tip. 

Back to the hotel room, the next day, we were hoping to be given a new and clean towels since we skipped one day of housekeeping, oh by the way there is no provided door tag so I had to write down Do Not Disturb. My own handwriting in  a cheap paper. So we put all the towels in the bathroom floor, they all have stains so we know which towels.... When we came back and our room is cleaned, the towels are brought back from the floor unchanged.....

This place is crap. Seriously, comparable to a Motel 6. Do yourself a favor and just pay a couple extra bucks for a better hotel (it'll make your experience a lot better)

The concierge wasn't very friendly or helpful (they were downright rude) and the staff took FOREVER to get us a couple extra towels for the room (we had 3 ppl per room, and they only stocked the room with 2 sets of towels). They refused to let us switch rooms and didn't give us 2 rooms next to each other with the adjoining door (blah blah blah, something about how they were all booked up and only had smoking rooms left, which I seriously doubt because the walls are paper thin and the room next door seemed empty). When I say paper thin, I mean it. You can seriously hear the people talking next door. Talk about lack of privacy. No wonder security had to come to our door since we were talking a little louder than usual that we were disturbing our neighbors... 

Not only did everything look super-outdated (they didn't even have a mini-fridge (WTH? don't they want to make extra money off of you?), but our bathroom shower didn't function properly. The pull thing for the shower wouldn't lift up all the way, so when you were taking a shower, the water from the bottom (for the tub) runs also, so you can only get like a half shower\/half bath.

The carpets in the hall are stained (not bad but very noticeable). Our room was fine for what a place to sleep - nothing really memorable about it.  I reserved a ""strip view"" room but because the hotel sits so far back off the street, the view of the strip is somewhat limited (also because of the Mandarin next door towering over).  The tint on our window was peeling off and unsightly.  There was a used Q-tip on the floor near the desk left from the last people there that the housekeeper didn't see.  I left it there and for 3 days, the housekeeper never picked up.  There was also a used straw and a used tissue on the floor.  Kind of hard to miss them, so I'm not sure what the housekeeper was doing.  The next day, the housekeeper left her floor rag in our bathroom. One of the rooms down the hall from me apparently ordered vegetables w\/ dip and the remains on the plate stayed in front of their door for 2 days.

On the positive side, the beds were comfortable, the rooms were quiet, the shower was hot, and the staff was friendly. We stayed on a non-smoking floor, which was a big bonus.  I hate the smell of lingering smoke.  The location isn't too bad if you plan on visiting multiple casinos since there are many within a short walk. They also have a free tram that will take you up to the Bellagio.  The pub located in the Monte Carlo is amazing,  There is an excellent selection of beer and good food.

However, this place is in high need of improvements.  The rooms seem rather old.  The wall paper was peeling off the wall in multiple places.  The bath towels also have this strange burned odor to them.  On an odder note, the toilet flush is a bit disturbing.  It's hard to explain, but I could imagine a small child being sucked down it.  I was also surprised that there was no type of mini-fridge in the room.

The pool area is set up very strangely.  They place the lounge chairs directly on top of each other, so you are elbow to elbow with the people next to you which makes adjusting the chair awkward and not very relaxing.  They allow you to bring no water with you, so you must purchase anything you eat or drink at the pool area.  I guess they don't mind guests being dehydrated.  One lady next to me at the pool area said they wouldn't even let her bring in Starbursts that were in the bottom of her bag.  This seems a bit extreme.

They also charge a $15 resort fee per day.  I was surprised to find there was no wifi in the rooms.  One of the two Starbucks at the hotel does have wifi, thought.  There is an Ethernet cord in the room.  The resort fee does include the fitness center, which I did not get a chance to visit. 

I have stayed at a couple different places on the strip, and this is probably the least nicest of them.  I am not sure I would pick this hotel to stay again.  It seems like a more suitable place to stay for the college aged looking for a place to crash after drinking for the night.",0,0,0

They will be remodeling the entire HOTEL once the construction of the arena is done. As of posting this review (Jan 2015) I was told none of the rooms were remodeled. I got a great room, clean, nothing fancy. Everything worked and was in order. Yes, it's not a 5-star hotel, but I'll gladly go again before the remodel. 
FOOD:
I normally order room service, but passed this trip. Everything you would need downstairs such as Starbucks, Micky D's, Pizza and sit down options. I had the buffet for dinner one night. Food was cold\/hot as should be, I was surprised drinks were serve-yourself, seemed a bit budget but no big deal. Cleaned extra plates right away.
PARKING:
The garage has plenty of room, no trouble finding a space close to elevator to casino bridge. Even with construction, I got in right away from Frank Sinatra and left in a jiffy via the strip.
Once remodel is done I would love to see what they do with the place! My last stay at Monte Carlo was in 1999.",0,0,1

For the price it's a clean, polished hotel without the crazy theme stuff. If they would just fix a few issues it would be my all time favorite and I'd stay every time I come here.

CONS - would give 4 stars if these were addressed
1. Spa closes at 7PM. They should be open until at least 8PM like other resorts on the strip. So often after a hard day of having fun there isn't enough time to make use of the spa. 

2. All pools and outdoor area is totally closed from around Oct to Mar. Yet most other resorts have at least one outdoor pool and jacuzzi open all year.

3. They have a nice large marble tiled lobby, but no easy chairs to relax in. To be fair, most of the hotel\/casinos don't provide any places to just relax. If the Monte Carlo added 10 or 12 comfortable lounge chairs it would really be great.

PROS
- best value (price for what you get) in Vegas
- location. Connected to tram for Aria and Bellagio. From Bellagio, just a short walk to Caesars Palace.
- Decent lean rooms. Good beds. Bathrooms could use a lighting update.

- Nicely laid out hotel\/casino with a clean non touristy look.",1,0,0

It took 45 min to check-in. No one in line was able to do express check-in, because no one had received a conformation email. I had to call two weeks ahead to double check my reservation. As we were waiting in line, excitedly talking about our vacation, I noticed a sign said ""visit these two pools!"" ... instead... of the Monte Carlo pool. What. The. Frick. We get to the counter, finally, and I ask about the pool. ""Oh yeah no it closed in like August or whatever...""... so I'm holding back and I ask her, ""How are we supposed to get to the other pools?"" (MGM and Mandalay pools - which if you've been to Vegas then you know that no one just WALKS across the street. Of course all of the escalators and crossovers were being repaired!). And she looks at me like I'm crazy. Again I ask, so she says, ""You just go to them and show your room key and they will let you in."" ""Ok, but how do we get there? Do you have a tram? Or a shortcut?"" ""Uhhhh no, you drive there..""

I'm not... whatever. So what do I do, right?! Suck it up. I then ask her if the room has a coffee maker. NOPE BUT THERES A STARBUCKS IN THE FOODCOURT BUT OH WAIT THEY CLOSED THAT A DAY INTO THE TRIP TOO FOR REFURBISHMENT. 

Ok fine.

The little ""Privacy Please"" card holder for your room door, when you don't want housekeeping in your room yet? Pointless. On our 2nd day there when we were waiting for the elevator to go begin our hour long adventure to the pool, the housekeeping lead came up to us and wanted to know if they could go in and clean. I said no and he replied, ""oh ok I guess I'll let her know then before she starts."" So I kind of spent the entire time wondering if someone was going to pop into the room unexpectedly. 

This is a new Vegas thing, which I'm not surprised or complaining about, but it is a thing now - parking is $10 a night. And it's automatic on your room fee. It makes sense. And it's not too bad because you can go to any hotel pretty much, and that $10 carries over everywhere. 

The Monte Carlo is now the Monte Car-NO! Haha

I sound like a friggin brat complaining over pools, coffee, and privacy.. but damn it's my vacation and I was really looking forward to unlimited and undisturbed amounts of all three!

AFTER spending a lot of money on dinner at one of their restaurants and seeing the Blue Man Group (underwhelming) I went to gamble a bit. 

The casino chair that I sat in was one of those big, cushioned, bolted-to-the-ground chairs. As I sat I immediately felt the unmistakable sog of a soaking wet chair. It sloshed up under me and everything I had on was immediately soaked. A second later I realized - IT WAS PEE. The smell... the burn...It was definitely PEE. When I got up and looked at the chair, the wet spot was in the shape of a seated butt and legs.

Long story short; I told 1 lady (that I thought worked there) that there was pee in the chair and her response was ""I know"".

I went to the concierge desk to tell them that the chair was full of pee. The man i talked to apologized and went about talking to someone else to go fix it. 

I had to throw away my underwear and am still undecided on what to do about the skirt (who wants to wear a white skirt with THAT memory).

I also got a huge rash on my butt that lasted for a week. 

I had sent an angry e-mail to the MC detailing my above experience, mainly because I only had that outfit that night which was cut short as a result of the situation. I had become mad about it.  I got a call where I was told that they would research my complaint and get back to me with-in 10 days. 

Its been over a month and they have not gotten back to me! 

The difference between a good business and a bad business is all in how they handle themselves. Even in the face of mistakes beyond their control. 

Even if all they did was formally apologize and close the loop of communication, I would have been fine.

PROS:
Location. Price. Entertainment options.

CONS:
Pretty much everything else including... rooms are very outdated featuring a tube (!) TV, old linens, stained carpeting and upholstery (and I mean tons of stains), dark brown decor, very old\/outdated fixtures in the bathroom, wired internet featuring the broken plugs, overwhelming smoke smell even in the non smoking rooms\/areas, lack of room comfort in bed and chairs etc. The rooms 'feel' dirty and the bathrooms are definitely rarely given proper attention.

The top six floors are probably the newest due to the massive fire that broke out in 2008. I stayed on the top floor (not the Hotel 32) and did not experience anything new as it all felt early 2000s.

The most ironic is that the hotel is named for the Place du Casino in the actual Monte Carlo in Monaco - I've been there and even with that historic building (built in 1858) feels fresher than this hotel. Argh.

I wish the MGM\/Mirage group would realize they can spend a few $ for some facelifts or at least turn the property in to something valuable.",1,0,0

It looks nice on the outside and you'd expect it to have something kinda cool or neat on the inside, but alas, no pizazz.  Not. At. All.  

PARKING STINKS.  

The bathroom -- AWWWWWWWWFUL! 
Complaint 1)  There was no vent!
Complaint 2)  When ya flush the toilet, it sounds and sucks in the water as if it were gonna suck you in as well. 
Complaint 3)  The faucet and sink.  When the water's running, so is a screeeeeeeeeeeching noise. 

The room itself -- Eh.
Although the king sized bed in our room was damn comfy, I didn't appreciate the blankets they had.  
The walls are wayyyyyyyy tooooooo thin.  Going to bed at 4am and being woken up by two of the four crying kids next door at 8am is NOT fun.  

The buffet sucks.

Well.  I wouldn't stay here again.  Although i've complained tons, I still won money in their small, not so popp'n, casino, so woohoo!  Eh,  I'm still not staying here again.  I guess I really can't stress that enough.  

Ok ok, i guess its not a craphole or anything, so its not as bad as I make it out to be.  Summertime and their lagoon pool would've helped.  But still.

All staff from valet to bell to front desk, etc. were very nice and helpful. We were pleasantly surprised with the fast check in at 4:00. We were accommodated with the highest floor 31 and adjoining rooms at no extra cost.  The price was excellent for this busy weekend.  Both rooms in our party were clean and adequate.  Bathrooms and showers were very clean with no signs of wear and tear like some others have reported.  Housekeeping was prompt both days of our stay.  The casino was what you would expect...a casino that smells like smoke. I'm not a smoker, but when I go anywhere in Vegas, I accept the smoke factor as something you just have to deal with.  We appreciated the number of $10 black jack tables that were available.  We had dinner at The Pub which was just meh.

My first impression when I first came in: a horrible old smell- kinda like old perfume. It's hard to breathe in the whole casino and lobby area.

The people at the front desk are a little unpleasant. I had to deal with two girls who you could tell didn't like their job. When we got our room key, we went upstairs and the key didn't work. I had to go back down to the lobby and try it again to find out it was the actual door that was having technical difficulties. Moving on to our second room, pretty decent. A little on the old side and not as clean as you would expect. However, this was not the bad part.

As soon as I went to shower you could see there was a drainage problem. The water in the tub wouldn't drain down which resulted in me showering with water raised to my ankles. After this, I immediately called the front desk and requested a change of room. After moving to the 3RD room, this was still an issue.....And we were on a different tower! I called the front desk and let them know that I did not want to change rooms again. She insisted on calling it in to get someone to fix it the following day but it was still an issue.

They waived my resort fees for the 3 nights we were there. The manager whom I spoke to was very understandable and handled the situation as best as he could but I do not plan on staying here again.",5,0,0

Although not on the same level as the Venetian or Mandalay Bay, you can't beat the price.  We stayed there for about $50 a night during Spring Break.  It is conveniently situated with a Deuce bus stop right in front.   It is true, the rooms need some updating.  The furniture and walls are scuffed, they still use bedspreads instead of duvets, and the curtains and bedskirts have seen better days, but the rooms are clean enough.   Be prepared, they have a wardrobe instead of closet which I suppose was to lend the room some Old World charm.  Our room offered a great view of the roller coaster at New York New York.  
Another reason to stay here as opposed to some of the more trendy hotels is the lack of waiting for elevators or taxis.  And finally, there is a food court featuring McDonald's, Starbucks, and Haagen Dazs, right downstairs so you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for something to snack on.",1,0,0

This hotel certainly fit the bill as I managed what I thought was a pretty good deal and it included a $75 food and beverage credit for use at The Pub, one of many restaurants on site.  We arrived at about 5 PM or so on Friday night and were met with a long check in line, but with a full staff working the counters, the line moved quickly and in short order we were checked in and ready to settle into our room.  As far as hotel rooms go, there is nothing special about it as it's your standard run of the mill room, though it was a nice size at least.  We noticed an off odor coming from the bathroom which we got rid of by keeping the plunger on the sink closed and thus decided not to complain since it turned out to be a minor inconvenience but worth points being docked off my review.  What kept this review from being a 3 star review was the great selection of restaurants on site (11 total and a food court with a few different options), the Monte Carlo has something for pretty much every taste and budget from budget friendly (food court) to the high end of things (Andre's and Brand Steakhouse).  Like most of the bigger Vegas hotels\/resorts, pretty much everything you need is under one roof so you don't need to go anywhere else.

Pros:

Inexpensive

Great selection of restauarants

Clean, well kept casino

Ease of navigating around hotel premises

Cons:

Definitely go to happy hours at The Cafe and the steakhouse in the hotel. Cafe has $6 appetizers and $2 beer! Steakhouse has $9 apps and 2 for 1 drinks.

If you're new to Vegas, you might find the Monte Carlo awesome.   In isolation to itself.  I mean, compared to a Hampton Inn, it's absolutely big and beautiful, right?  

But compared to other similar casinos on the strip, it's merely another boomerang from above shaped three tower hotel.  The Mirage has dolphins and greenery, and Treasure Island has some kind of pirate\/slutty theme, but the Monte Carlo is just --

-- the Monte Carlo.  

It lacks that WOW factor.  It lacks a Cirque show like its sister MGM properties.  It used to have Lance Burton, who I thought was a highway billboard joke until I finally saw his great show and realized he one of the few reasons left to make the Monte Carlo a destination.  And Lance is gone now.

My one night at the Monte Carlo was memorable enough to ensure I'd never return.  No nightmare, really, just two simple things that went really wrong:

1.  The toilets are UNBELIEVABLY loud.  I don't care about that in my room so much, but early in the morning I heard every last toilet in the place flush.  Silly me, I wanted to sleep past 6 AM.  It was a God awful issue and something that never replicated in the Mirage and Caesars.  Little sleep = ruined vacation day.  Is it really worth saving $50 or so a night for that?

2.  It took almost 40 minutes for the valet to retrieve our car.  And not just our car.  Everyone was standing around -- freezing to death -- waiting for their cars.  Why?

And so, as always in Vegas, cheaper rates result in cheaper services.  When I walk through this hotel, I notice lots of cheap eats.  The good side is that you're not paying a fortune to eat.  The bad news is that it's McFood which you can eat anywhere... and so why come all the way to Vegas for a McRib?

The Monte Carlo -- in a nutshell --  is an affordable McResort.",2,4,0

The guest room that we are in is really no different than what you might get at three star hotel.  The front desk and and receptionist aren't too friendly. The check-in process was disorganized. The room itself is older.  There is limited furniture and you can hear everyone in the hall.  The bed is comfortable though with clean sheets and a comforter that gets washed just as often. 

The first room we were assigned to the key cards didn't work and people were making all sorts of crazy noise at noon across from us.  They moved us to another floor with working key cards.  The elevator setup seems efficient to regulate flow of traffic and the rooms are spaced well from the elevator. 

The best perk about the room is the semi-large flat screen TV and the pretty bathroom tiles. The water pressure is very strong, too.  There is also a nice magnifying mirror, but in general the bathroom is small. 

Major cons are small room and bathroom size, dated look, marked up walls, old furniture, no ice bucket, no fridge, no water heater, limited sink space.

There are a lot of on-site amenities... restaurants, food courts, and more. Also, this hotel is directly next to 24 hour CVS and Walgreens if you need anything. 

We are only here one night in December.  We didn't use the pools.  I remember being here about 9 years ago and I liked the pools. Looks like the decor hasn't changed since then.

Also, the WiFi is spotty.  My iPad didn't pick up any connection but my MBP did.

The front desk agent was very friendly, as was all the staff.  We didn't have to wait more than 1 minute in any line.  The only glitch we had  was on arrival, they didn't have our suite ready, and were told we would have to wait one hour as they cleaned it, and  to then check with the desk...meaning we didn't get our room till 6pm, however this was made up for, and the room had a  great view.  We loved the layout of this hotel, because the elevators are just off the lobby, along with the food court, and shops.  The Casino is big but not unmanageable like some of its neighbors.  The hotel doesn't smell like smoke, however like a few other hotels they do have a fragrance smell, but I liked it better than smelling the cigarettes\/cigar smoke.  

A huge highlight was the Free Tram that runs from Monte Carlo to Bellagio this saved us time, and walking city center is confusing at best, due to all the ongoing construction.

Its funny that before this trip we never really considered this hotel, as we had never even set foot on the property, because there isn't much  to draw big crowds however this is a great property for us as we go to see shows, gamble, shop, and eat.

Okay, the nicest thing about the hotel was the LOCATION. Aria was like 10 minute walk, which was a huge plus since we were going to Jewel, the nightclub in Aria and for their casino.

Check-in line was fairly long as they only had about 5-6 on staff for the busy Holiday weekend but it was also about 9:30pm when we rolled in. The lady that helped check us in was very friendly. We weren't so happy about the additional $25\/night ""resort fee"". We should have asked what exactly does that cover... Because we didn't even have a coffee maker in our room.

Upon entering the entering room, there wasn't any ""wow factor"" with the room. It looked dated and worn. The desk chair looked like it was picked up from the local thrift store it was so banged up. Bathroom fixtures were gold... I'm sure these were ""luxury"" at one point in time but now they looked old and cheesy. Caulking around shower\/tub was moldy. Toiletries were cheap no-name brand. My husband found a fingernail and a shard of glass on the floor. The glass would have been fun to step on barefoot. I have honestly stayed in Marriotts that were like 5-star rooms compared to this place. A positive was that the bed was super comfy. I just kept telling myself that we wouldn't be spending much time in the room anyways... Basically to sleep and shower so who cares if he room isn't the greatest, the money we saved by saving here can go towards having fun\/eating\/drinking. Oh yeah, and our room overlooked the pool- so we got to listen to the obnoxious BLARING music pretty much all day long. Go to the room to take a little recharge nap? Not a chance. Ridiculous.

Pool: unfortunately we didn't get to enjoy the pool as much as we thought we would... We came Memorial Day weekend and it was in the 60s with clouds our first 2 days. On our third day we lounged out by the pool for an hour or two. Chairs are right on top of each other... Literally, they could not get any closer together. It would be a bit awkward when it is so packed that a stranger would be squeezed up again you, staring into your face, inches away, if you were facing each other. Actually never actually got in the pool but nice to have options of different ones to go in. Not a fan of their extremely loud music which plays pretty much all day long... This isn't the Rehab pool at the Hard Rock. Turn that sh** down. 

I like that there was a food court for quick snacks and meals with Starbuck's, Subway, McDonalds, Sabarro, Rubios, a stir fry place and some chicken tender place... But it'll cost ya. 6 inch ham sub from Subway was almost $7. Bottle of water from the newsstand was $4. Convenient, yes. Pricey, f**k yes!

Until we realized there were open water bottles on the table, some false eyelashes in the trash, rearranged pillows,and other random things left behind. Sounds like the last occupants snuck back in after the house keeper.

Called downstairs and they were extremely apologetic and relocated us. It was clean and ready, so we took it ... but it wasn't nearly as nice as the room on the 29th floor. (We got moved down to the 23rd). 

At the end of our stay I called downstairs to arrange a late check out, and from the time I hung up to confirm that was an option and the time I made it downstairs to pay, they were sold out of that option. The manager was awesome and extended our check out to 1PM. 

Yeah, we hit some hiccups, but they handled it well. Unfortunately, when these things happen there's not much they can do. 

I appreciate the graciousness of the front desk agent in the initial call, and also the assistance of the manager in regards to late check out.

But hey, if that's the worst part of my trip then I can't really complain, right? 

Good news: The BLVD area they built up is awesome! I can't wait to check out a concert at the new T-Mobile Arena and I'll definitely be back for some Shake Shack.

Parking: $10.00 a night? And I am already paying a $40.00 a night resort fee? Not a great initial impression.

First Impression Of Hotel: We entered the Hotel\/Casino from the parking garage. The walk way was tiled but most of the tiles were chipped and the grout was dirty. Inexplicably, there is a  15 ft length of carpet in the tile that looks absolutely trashed. Made for a not great impression but we continued in. The casino floor near check in looked nice and was active. 

Check In: We arrived in the check in line about 11 PM on a Friday night. It was pretty busy, but moved fairly quickly. When it was our turn to check in, we were asked how we made our reservation. I said Priceline. She asked do you want 2 queens or a King. We stated we were wanting a King. She said okay. She got us checked in with very little interaction. The person checking in next to us was told how their pool is closed but you can use the pool at MGM or Mandalay Bay. They were also told how to get to their room. Once our check in was complete, we weren't told about any amenities or how to get to our room. We specifically had to ask. 

The Room: We went to our room, on the 9th floor on our way to the room the carpet literally had a small bump or wave in front of the suitcase the entire walk down the hall. This didn't represent a 4 star hotel, but oh well. We opened the door to our room and find 2 queen beds. A disappointment. We call down to the desk waited on hold about 5 minutes. Got switched to a room with a king bed, and didn't have to go wait in the check in line again which was a plus. 
We got to our room, the tile in the entrance\/bath was dirty. The wallpaper the peeling, ripped and had holes. There was no clock\/alarm clock. There were no outlets by the bed. There wasn't a fridge in the room. The worst, the Toilet paper, single ply sand paper. I understand it's a cost, but we are PAYING to stay. I don't expect the best but I also expect a grade above sand paper. Many things you'd think that would be automatic with a 4-Star hotel and the price the comes with it.

The Casino: Casino seemed decent didn't play a lot. They did have live music in one of the lounge areas both Friday and Saturday night that was very nice. 

Restaurants: They do have a Starbucks, which is a plus. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants. We attempted to at 6:00 PM on Saturday. The restaurant we tried to go to was the Italian one. It wasn't even half full and they said on Saturday's you have to have a reservation if you want to eat before 7:00 PM. We walked over to MGM and had no problem eating at Wolfgang Pucks restaurant which my wife enjoyed the best meal she's ever had there. 

Due to the check-in issues. The Room that was a disaster. And not being able to eat at their Restaurants we are giving the Monte Carlo a 1 Star due to the cost and representing itself as a 4 Star hotel and it is nothing close to that.",1,1,0

There is no Wi-Fi in this hotel.  You can get free WIRED internet in your room, but we had an iPad with us, so that didn't matter.  The receptionist at the desk told us that there should have been a cable in our room for us to use, but we didn't see one.  Again, however, that didn't matter because we had a tablet.

Also, you pay a $20 resort fee per day when you stay here which is supposed to include the newspaper, and use of the fitness and business centers.  Since we did not have internet in our room, we used the computer in the business center to print out a coupon for dinner that we wanted to use.  To our surprise, we had to pay $1 PER MINUTE for usage of the internet, and an additional $1.50 per page that we printed.  So, usage of the business center is NOT actually included in the resort fee.  

To their credit, when we brought this to the attention of the receptionist at check-out, she did offer to take $10 off towards the resort fee total for the inconvenience (and misleading information).

Other than that, I can't complain about our stay.  The place was clean and is conveniently located on the Strip.  It's not ""fancy-schmancy"" like some of the other resorts, but hey...if all you need is a clean place to crash at the end of the night, it's a fine hotel.",1,0,0

I did use MyVegas points and that was hella easy.  I was stunned.  And check in at 2 PM on a Wednesday was a breeze.  The rooms were as I remembered.  They aren't great but they aren't awful.  They're dated, sure...  but you get WiFi (included in your daily resort fee which is I think around $33 a day) and the usual amenities.  I realize it's Vegas and you're not in the room much but I can't sleep without a TV on and the channel selection is so minuscule!  And the shower head is a joke.  Those need to be replaced\/upgraded ASAP.  They aren't cool or functional and probably haven't been since the 80's.

The bigger complaint though is the size of the gaming area.  I just found it so SMALL.  I don't know if they've reduced the size or I've just spent more time in much larger casinos but I really had a hard time finding a game I wanted to play.  And forget getting a drink while you're gambling.  You could sit there all night and not be approached by a cocktail server.  Worst gaming experience I've seen on the Strip.

The service at the sports bar is still spot on and in general I find the Monte Carlo to be a friendly place that is also pretty conveniently located.  The plans to charge for parking are all set - the ticket system is already in place in the garage so when that happens, you'll be soaked for yet another charge.  And once that happens I really think we'll look for another place to stay in Vegas.  The MC is showing it's age and just isn't very much fun anymore.

In my last Vegas trips, 4 out of 5 times, we stay at Monte Carlo. I love the buffet there. 

I LOOVE their pools.  I love being swept around in the 'River' and floating along the waves in the other one. Fun memories. Kids definitely love it. 

I've never had any complaints about Monte Carlo. Of course in the future, if I have more money, I would love to try the more expensive hotels just for fun. But Monte Carlo will always be 'familiar territory' for me. I love how it's located right in the strip. I have this theory that 'If we're not on the strip, we're NOT in VEGAS!'

Maybe one bad thing....their arcade sucks, but I don't go there anyways. Excalibur is much better

EDIT 
I don't know why but this place is not as poppin as it use to be. Maybe it was because of the fire earlier this year, but it's a lot emptier. Monte Carlo use to be my favorite casio\/hotel...but for now Bellagio has my attention.

EDIT**

I actually stayed at this place, the past weekend. The POOLS are not the same! It's very boring. The 'river' use to be pretty fast, sweeping you around, along with caves and waterfalls. All of that is gone, it's very slow-paced...the Wave pool is not what is anymore. Before the waves were nonstop continuous. Now they turn it on every 10 minutes for about 5 minutes, then turn it off. What's the point of that?

Alot of the changes might be due to safety reasons, but I was watching the lifeguards, I could've sworn one of them was sleeping. Oh! The tubes! You use to be able to rent them and ride it on the river, now you have to pay $12.95 to BUY them, it's ridiculous

Aside from that, they have a food court and shops downstairs, and lots of slot machines and table games. They have a pool as well but it was too cold to go there. Unfortunately, their souvenir shops didn't carry certain take-it-home casino games that one of us was looking for.

The technology in their room is very outdated... their clock is for an iPhone 4! Ha, ha, ha!

Anyway, due to my entire party having entirely different jobs and work schedules, we all ended up having to hog the Ethernet cable due to the lack of wi-fi in a single 2-bedroom room. How was any of us supposed to get any work done? I had already brought a lot of power strips with me to compensate for the lack of outlets, but now I'm also supposed to bring an Ethernet switch? What's next, am I supposed to ask the IT guy at work for a server rack so I have to configure the entire connection manually? The speed of the internet is also extremely slow. None of us were able to get any significant work done and our clouds didn't save or load properly. I know wi-fi is available downstairs, but I couldn't find an outlet. Now I'm supposed to bring my own electricity? The amount of tech I have to prepare to stay here already costs more than the total hotel bill. And we paid a separate fee for it too. (Luckily, I wasn't the one paying the bill, but since I'm staying here, I have to deal with it.)

Additionally, the shower does not drain properly. As a result, I was standing ankle-deep in a vat of my own body byproducts (interpret that as you will, I have a lot of medical conditions) and my prescription drugs that require the use of water. Not to mention that the person that wanted to shower after me had taken notice of the leavings in there since it hadn't drained yet and wondered what was wrong with me. I don't remember this happening the last time some of us came here, so what happened to the showers between this time?

Aside from those two problems, the beds are fine, the toilets are fine, the doors are fine, the sink is fine (luckily, it drains properly as opposed to the shower), the mirror is fine, the chairs are fine, the elevators are fine, and the window is fine. I just cannot get any work done with everyone wanting the line and I'm not sure how clean my feet are.

In conclusion, this is no Courtyard Marriott, and after telling my boss about this (he's not happy about the reduced amount of work I did due to the internet issue), he definitely doesn't want to stay here for CES since he still needs to work while at the trade show, so one shouldn't come here if they have to work at the same time. Also, I'm really grossed out by repeatedly standing in my body byproducts every day when I take a shower. If I wanted to do that intentionally, I would take a shower in the toilet. Blech.

- The room was decent. It had a bed, blanket, shower, LCD TV, toilet. But then again, so does Motel 6....
- AC works well, which is nice when its hot all day and night outside
- Pool and fitness center were good. In fact, they give FREE BOTTLED WATER in the fitness center. Amazing!

- Whirlpool and sauna in the spa area are actually free for guests.

Bad Points:
- No wireless internet. Just an ethernet cord stapled to the wall coming up onto the desk. If you really want wireless, just bring your own router, or bring your own super long ethernet cord and plug it into the cable modem under the TV cabinet.
- The ad for Jabawookeez plays nonstop. Everywhere. All the time. 
- While the room is decent, when you look closely there are issues. The wallpaper was peeling in some spots in the bathroom. The carpet seemed old. There is no fridge (but you can rent one for the low low price of $25\/night!). The shower started to drain poorly by day 3. The sink makes a loud ""glug"" sound when it drains. Like it wants to eat your hands....

There is also a distinct ""Monte Carlo Smell"": air freshener to cover the cig smoke ... plus the cig smoke. You always know when you are back. 

Anyway, I think on a budget, and if you dont plan to spend much time here, this place is fine. I wouldn't come to Vegas just to stay here or see this place.",0,1,0

- The door number plaque was missing, and someone promptly used a sharpie to write the door number in.
- The safe in the room was broken
- After declining maid service and putting the ""do not disturb"" card on the door, I returned to find my room was cleaned and $200 was missing from my room. My friend with me also had cash stolen from her personals.
- After filing a ""security report"" the hotel offered me a $50 room credit as a show of good faith. When I checked out, there was NO record of the $50 room credit.

Also, there was no one our age here at all. I wish I had known everyone was at least 50 years old. My boyfriend and I (22 and 25) felt very out of place.
Finally, the biggest reason we will not be back is that the place is an overall ripoff. I just can't figure out why they charge at extra $20 resort fee for stuff like water and craps lessons. Does this mean we can opt out of these services? No!
Similarly, they do annoying things like give out free drink tickets for spending some certain amount of money at the (ghetto) casino. The thing about these drink tickets is that it's not as easy as walking up to the bar and asking for a drink. You have to track down the mythical waitress to get your drink. I never found this waitress although the bartender swore was ""around here somewhere."" So thanks for the useless drink tickets, that ended up coming home in my pockets.

Monte Carlo is definitely a little smaller than some of the massive hotels like MGM and Caesar's, but that's a positive factor for me. You can walk in the door and there's a sign that points you where you need to go and it's not a giant tease!

The check-in line was huge and took absolutely forever to get in, but they let us check in a few hours early, so I can't complain about it too much.

The carpet everywhere seemed a little dated and in our room honestly looked like it needed to be replaced. The window was also really thin and didn't quite fit in the frame just right (it opens a couple inches and it took the both of us to lift it at just the right angle to get it fully closed). It also could use a little re-caulking.

It was a vicious two to three year cycle of staying exclusively at the Monte Carlo...and we would often visit Vegas three to four times in a year. That's a lot of Monte Carlo.

At the time, my impressions of the hotel weren't bad. It was THEN in a good location, it wasn't the disgusting Circus Circus, and it was still considered relatively ""new."" The rooms were clean with nothing to complain about.

However, I have since then stayed at MUCH, MUCH nicer hotels on the strip such as Bellagio, The Venetian and The Palazzo. Boy does staying at hotels like those really leave a bad taste in your mouth when you begin thinking about a place like Monte Carlo.

Up-front, the resort looks pretty upscale. Almost like a Caesars Palace II. It has a pretty Roman statue-lined exterior facade and marble foyer registration area. It's got chandelier domes. But when you look a little closer, it's not hard to notice the non-brand name shops, the cheap-eat cafeteria-style food court, absence of a resident nightclub, and pathetic attempt at a porte-cochere tugged off to the side of the hotel by an ugly parking lot.

Parking here is miserable. It's not like you park, grab your suitcase, go to the elevator and ride it up to the inside of the casino. If you park in the outdoor flat lot (like at a Six Flags theme park), you have to drag your luggage from your car to the hotel while the sun is beating down on you. If you opt to park in the hotel's parking structure, you still have to trek over a uncovered pedestrian bridge that connects the structure to the hotel. Considering Vegas summers exceed triple-digits, dragging heavy luggage in 110-F heat with the sun beating down on you is not fun.

The guest rooms here are very bland. However, they're clean and have muted colors. Nothing fancy, nothing spectacular, nothing over-the-ordinary. Bathrooms are very motel-like. There's the tub and shower combination with a plain shower curtain and a toilet that has the sucking power of a turbo vacuum. The guest rooms here at Monte Carlo would suit a kind of person that rarely spends any time winding down in the room, but only uses it to get some zzzz's

The pool area is rather nice for this hotel. Lots of palm trees. It has a lazy river, which is a treat.

The thing about Monte Carlo is that it openly admits that it's about perceived luxury on a budget. It's the godsend for midwesterners coming to Vegas and wanting to experience a European style resort and accommodations without having to break the bank. Unfortunately, the whole European theme really ends on the exterior. No theme is carried into the hotel itself.

While not the worst place on the strip, it definitely has seen better days. I can't imagine what it's like staying at Monte Carlo at the moment, with the CityCenter construction going full blast next door. The noise must be so awful.",11,2,4

First off, the self-parking is non-existent so you have to valet.  I believe there is a tiny lot between MC and NYNY but it is usually full.  Entering the hotel from the valet, you will be at the front desk\/lobby which is nice and convenient.   Check in is a breeze and the hotel elevators are located very near the check-in desk.  I'm not sure why this hotel receives such low ratings on the rooms but I found mine to be very nice, clean and had a nice view of the north side of the strip.   Over I oversaw the pool and the construction, I heard NO NOISE at all.  The only downside to the room were the super THIN walls.  I could hear the people next door talking and screaming about some stupid crap that isn't it worth me writing to ya'll about.  Besides that, the room is spacious but not as big as the higher end hotels.  With the price offered on promo deals, you can't really complain about that.  I uploaded a picture of the view from my room on the 29th floor \/w construction.  

There aren't too many reviews of the casino, so i'll go ahead and mention that it isn't really all that great.  They offer the usual games.  Blackjack shoe game is decent with surrender option and 3-2 payout.  Penetration isn't all that great for those that understand.  Single deck bj game is the usual crap 6-5...etc.  They have two mini-baccarat games and a few more in the high limit section.  Slots were pretty tight  too.  

The pool was decent but not as good as the ones at MGM, Mandalay etc.  I liked their lazy river but there are too many damn kids around so they definetly need to add an ADULT pool!!!  Lastly, I want to mention the SPA here.  I didn't get any special treatments besides getting a free entrance for the steam\/sauna\/gym.  It is nothing special and actually pretty crappy.  Think about going into 24 hour fitness and using their steam and sauna rooms...its about the same!",3,2,1

Cons! - I wasn't a fan of the room, after having stayed at better hotels, this is not keeping up with the times.

When I entered the room it had just 2 pillows on the bed, I'm thinking...seriously? I am more comfortable at home, the whole point of going away from home is to be MORE comfortable...it's a getaway!

First off the check in policy was miserable.  The line was ungodly long while a manager (Clayton) just sat on his computer and was supposedly doing ""reservations"" and stated how he was understaffed -- THEN HELP YOUR STAFF!  I asked for an upgrade which was immediately given to me to their newly renovated rooms on the 19th floor.  FYI - it was 109 degrees in Vegas and the air conditioning was not spectacular.  

I booked through expedia and got an email a few days later after the booking about how the hotel was under construction for the pool and we'd have access to the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay pools - OK cool! No big deal.  Also - it is impossible on expedia and the monte carlo site to even find where it says its under construction.  On Monte Carlo after looking forever it is under terms and conditions - NO one reads that unfort.

Come Monday morning at 7AM there was they loudest sound of someone drilling that sounded like it was coming through the door.  They were doing construction on the rooms around us which by the way is not written anywhere on expedia or monte carlo site saying the rooms were being worked on.  I called down and they offered ear buds which was not going to block out how loud this was - it was brutal.  Then they could switch our rooms.

I go downstairs around 9 since I couldn't take the noise or hear my friends sitting next to me to talk.  I waited in a long ass line and tried to get moved to a different hotel or room - They couldn't do a different hotel.  They moved us up several floors - I walk into that room and it smells like someone just smoked 18 packs of cigarettes in there....I call down to Renata at the front desk who was very helpful the first time and they tell me they can't put her on even though she said to ask for her. She also returned my resort fee which I thanked for since well there was no resort to enjoy.  I went down again and waited in another over 20 min line to tell her about the room.  I called expedia to cancel the last night as I wanted to book a different hotel with nicer staff and ones that actually do their damn job.  The hotel said no to them and would penalize me for an early check-out - ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.  I moved rooms again and spent the last night there.

The staff are friendly and courteous. We checked in around midnight and since we were in a city that never sleeps, we had to wait in line for quite a bit. Luckily, check-in was a breeze and off we were to our room, tired and exhausted from our drive.

Our room looked pretty outdated. It was simple, two beds, a tv, dresser, writing desk and a chair. The overall interior was kind of depressing to me with the curtain and carpet color. Oh and walls are really thin between the rooms. Our next door neighbor was not a happy camper after hearing my toddler's cries. It was classy of them to bang our walls and let us know. 

The bathroom was spacious, complete with basic toiletries and again, outdated. Housekeeping didn't replace our shampoo and conditioner the next day nor were there any complimentary bottles of water for drinking on our first day. We had to find a cart on our floor to ask for some. Meanwhile, flushing the toilet makes this loud obnoxious noise which can be annoying especially when you're asleep and someone uses the bathroom at night. 

Here we are finally having our much needed rest and the smoke detector starts sending off a chirping sound every 3-5 seconds. We called it in and they say the battery needs changing. We had to wait a good half hour before someone came to our room to fix it. Not a very good first night...chirp...chirp...chirp!

Morning came and I'm just glad the hotel houses a Starbucks along with other fast food eateries such as Subway and Sbarro. All I wanted was my caffeine before hitting the buffets so that was a good start.

I can't say much about their casino as I don't gamble but Ignite Bar has happy hour from midnight to 2am on weekdays. It's located right at the Las Vegas Blvd. entrance of the hotel in the casino area. For other entertainment, check out their deals for The Blue Man Group show. 

They were nice enough to give us a late check-out 'til noon. When checking out, you can either do it the old-fashioned way or check-out via your room TV. It's faster and more convenient compared to lining up at the front desk. 

Would I come back? If the price is right, yes! Located on the strip with a tram that connects to CityCenter and Bellagio, their location is pretty much their saving grace. Valet is free but can take a while during peak hours. I'm all for walking to the garage to burn off all the buffet food!",7,4,4

I chose to stay there again because the rooms were reasonably priced and the hotel is centrally located. 2 pluses.  My first stay there I was with a big group of friends and missed some of the details that I noticed the second time when it was just one other friend and myself.  There was no information about the spa in the hotel room.  When I called dow the the concierge I was told I could come down and get one if I wanted.  Additionally there was no entertianment guide or lsiting to show what the T.V. channels were.  Little details, I know.  But little details can add up to one big less than stellar experience.  Additionally, i found their Premium Steak House: Brand, over priced and the staff rude.  I ended up at Gallagher's Steakhouse at New York - New York Hotel & Casino and it was perfect.

 My last stay 3 years ago wasnt so bad and it was quite decent at a fair price. I never mind it because it wasnt a circus circus. So for this past stay...my bf and i decided to a trip to LV on a spontaneous\/just because trip. Price was fair around 114 bucks for two nights..not including the annoying $20 resort fee. I did recieve 2 buffet passes since i booked it on expedia and their big belly buffet is amazing! even better than the higher end buffets like aria's. 

the front desk was very personable and friendly...i love it when i can get great customer service and have a mini convo rather than a angry chick typing away and youre silent for 15 mins. at first she said there was no room availiable for a 1 king bed...which i found a lil weird because i arrived around 230 so yes its a half an hour early but not even a common room like that? i guess. they only had a double bed open and i asked if i were to upgrade to a suite how much it would be...but it wasnt really much a discount..even though i was willing to pay for a upgrade..just didnt seem worth it because i felt as if it wasnt a great of a discount..if i went on expedia.com then yeah maybe.  i asked how long it would take for my original standard king bed room would be and she said ""oh it could be hours and hours.""

wth. why in the world would be hours and hours?! thats cray. mhm, i went there..a lil ghetto in me came out.

so i was getting frustrated because it was like going back and forth with options. she looked further into her computer and found a king sized bed but it was a handicapped version of it out of nowhere. i didnt get how it just magically opened up but i took it because i didnt want to wait for hours and i wanted to get my drink on already.

the room was average, better than tropicana, better than excalibur's...one lamp had a lightbulb out, rusty stains in the bathroom, keyboard for the tv didnt work, one of the comforters had a torn hole in them, toliet and bathtub water pressure were super hard! (it was scary flushing your shit down because it felt like it would suck your ass and whole body too!), and other small cosmetic flaws...but even with that i was okay with it because like i said it was a just because trip and it wasnt like i was celebrating an anniversary or a bday..so for the price thats what i got. 

the hotel was at a great location in my opinion..in middle, we used the tram everyday of our trip..great transportation, shops are decent, buffet is amazing, clean casino, clean rooms, self parking lot was breeze (minus the construction) and a good atmosphere..i just wished there was a lil more to see.

i would love to try their hotel 32 if i could afford it one day haha.",1,3,1

Check-in was fast and the front desk agent did a great job explaining where everything was to us. We stayed in room 15-313 and we were satisfied with our room selection (two queens). The room had a semi-strip view, you could see Outback Steakhouse and Coca-Cola World from the window. Our room was not luxurious but it was clean and no appliances were broken.  I am actually thinking about booking my next Vegas visit at the Monte Carlo. 

The only aspect of the Monte Carlo I had was with some of the dealers. My buddies and I gambled a lot there and encountered many friendly dealers. But three of the most darn awful dealers I met were these African women (Not African-American) and they were absolutely inadequate at their job. They would make many dealing mistakes, refuse to own up to it and get mad at you for confronting them about it.

case 1) Free Bet Blackjack: Dealer pushes on all hard 22s.
After all the players made the decisions, the African dealer exposed an A,2 as her cards. Her next card was a 9 for a 12\/22. She automatically pushes the hand, at which point I confront her about having to take another card because it's only a 12. She rejects my claim and I request a manager. She responds with a NO, and immediately discards the cards in the tray. 

case 2) Free Bet Blackjack: You have to make certain hand signals when you want a ""free bet"" for your double down or split.
This different African dealer had made a number of mistakes already, resulting in the pit boss coming to check on her a few times. Players would make the appropriate double down hand signal for a 9\/10\/11 and she would sometimes give out the next card, forgetting to put out the FREE BET coin. On the second time this happened to me, she claimed I didn't give the appropriate hand signal. With the support of the entire table, I argued I had and she was mistaken. Again, she was adamant that she was correct and she refused to give me a FREE BET coin or call the pit boss over. 

Over the next two days, I would receive this same type of attitude from these African women dealers, nobody else. By the second day, I made it a point not to play with any of these dealers because it was just uncomfortable.

Monte Carlo is located right next to the Aria Hotel & Casino, so you could walk there in 2-3 minutes easily. There is also a free tram that will take you to the Bellagio too. The Monte Carlo does not offer much in terms of restaurants and luxury, but they provide a clean and comfortable atmosphere for their guests to stay and gamble at.",4,0,1

We only stayed here for one night. There was a convention in town so a lot of the 4* properties on the Strip were starting at a rack rate of $200\/night. I was debating between Planet Hollywood or Monte Carlo. Monte Carlo won out because it was next to the hotel we were staying for Fri-Sat. A few years back, I had a former manager who had extended stays there whenever he was in Vegas and he said it was a nice hotel, so that kind of sealed the deal. I had read recent TripAdvisor reviews regarding the construction, so I shelled out $94 for a high floor room and added a request for a quiet room. I also noted that we were celebrating our 10th anniversary in hopes that the Front Desk agent would accommodate our request.

We arrived around 2pm and the check-in line was lengthy, but they had plenty of Front Desk agents and a floor manager to expedite the process, so we probably spent about 5-7 minutes in line. Our Front Desk agent, Crystal, was friendly and personable, assigning us a room overlooking the pool area on the 31st floor. 

There is a $28\/night resort fee. The resort fee was getting popular when I last visited Vegas 5 years ago. It's here to stay, folks. Even when you're booking through Priceline or Expedia it clearly says there is a resort fee that you pay separately. The resort fee for the Monte Carlo included: 2 bottles of Monte Carlo water, 2 vouchers for a drink at Ignite Bar (up to $12 in value) or a tea or coffee drink at Samba Latte, excluding taxes and gratuity. You also have access to the gym and a free newspaper, which is located by the elevators on each floor. Wired internet is also included. I'm not sure if pool or spa access is included, but the pool was closed for the winter, so that wasn't applicable for us.

Wired internet was no problem and was actually preferred! My boyfriend is a bit of techie and had purchased a Mini Pocket Router prior to our trip. Plug this into a wired connection and it allows you to set up a wireless hot spot. From this we were able to connect our phones and iPad to wifi in our room. He brought the Chromecast which we then used to stream shows he had put on the iPad onto the TV.

Being as I, too, work in luxury hospitality, and in the spa\/health club department at that, I kind of understand the Vegas resort fee and wished my hotel in DC did that--it would go a long way in maintenance during slow months when we didn't have a lot of revenue coming in from services. However, asides from a USA Today and the internet, we did not utilize anything else. The free water? I thought it would come at turn down service, but they don't do that here. The drink vouchers? Never got around to using them, so left them with our cash tip to the housekeeper at the other hotel we stayed at. Thus, the resort fee did not hold much value for us at all.

The room itself was no-frills and is in need of an update. Even the ""Go"" rooms at the Flamingo are more modern--and the Flamingo is about as cheesy as it gets on the Strip! I think Engineering had shut off the water to our floor because when we attempted to run hot water from the faucet, it would sputter. No hot water would come out, but cold water would be available. Eventually towards the evening, the hot water returned. No issues with hot water for the shower the following day. There was decent water pressure, though the shower head is quite low, so tall people beware! On a final note, we slept soundly and did not hear any construction noise at all. Additionally, we dined at Yusho, which was excellent, though on the pricey side. Check-out was seamless via the Express Check-out kiosks. It clearly outlined the charges and uses the credit card you provided for incidentals at check-in. It also emails the final invoice to you, as well.

Location: Excellent

Rooms: Could use a rehab 

Price: Good value for standard rooms starting at $85

Resort Fee: Not much of a value--they could lower it to $15-20 to include internet, gym access, and 2 drink vouchers for bottled water, coffee\/tea, or drinks. Save money and paper and don't bother with the newspaper subscriptions. Purchasing Department wouldn't have to order as many cases of water, either.",7,0,0

I booked my suite over a month ahead of time for my boyfriend's bday celebration. We arrived on a Friday and checked in at 2:45pm. At check In they said our room would not be ready until 5pm! I had dinner reservations and had to get ready. We killed time by getting something to eat. We came to check up at 4pm to see if our room was ready or to request a new room. According to them everything was book. After 10 minutes they claimed our room was ready. We rushed to our room to find the door wide open and a maid still cleaning the floor which had a big spilled wine looking stain on it. We had to wait an additional 20 minutes outside. After we walked in we both took our shoes off and walked right over the stain and the carpet was soaked!. We immediately went downstairs and switched us to another room (I was told 30 minutes before that everything else was booked!!) Once we got our other room we only had a 1 person Jacuzzi, not a 2 person Jacuzzi just how it states on their website, the living room was full of crumbs and there were ashes in the front rest room with garbage on the floor, the upholstered chairs had huge dark, nasty stains on them and our view sucked. We were already too exhausted to go complain again so we waited until the following morning. After I spoke to the manager they had no other room to switch us into so they sent up maids to address the issues and they replaced our chairs. The manager claimed and admitted that their hotel is in desperate need of renovations which actually will be started next year. The sofa was extremely stained and we found baby toys and so much garbage under the cushions. By the 2nd day the rest room stopped working. Wifi does not work! You get no cell phone reception in your rooms! Our drinks took 1 day and a half to finally cool in the mini fridge. The room is really dark and the 3 lamps they have in there barely give you lighting. The wet bar area has plenty of lightning but does not extend to the living room. One lamp in living room makes no difference at all. On a plus side room service was fast, maids cleaned up restrooms and made our bed really well during our stay. The manager at the front desk was really helpful and quick to solve the issues we found in our room but I felt like half the time I was in Vegas I was at the front desk complaining about a new issue I found. Having paid for a ""suite"" I was really surprised of the condition of the room it was in and all the issues it had with it.

I kind of liked the view of New York New York and MGM from our window. My parents made the mistake of staying at Circus Circus last time and they were much happier this time around. The room was clean and it was mostly quiet, except that I didn't really like how thin the walls were. We didn't hear much, but it was very loud whenever a ""neighbor"" was coming\/going and the first night there was a person with a nasty cough near-by (that wasn't fun to listen to now and again). The bedding was.... fine. Nothing fancy, but it was clean and that's all I cared about. The pillows weren't super comfortable so my parents were a little grumpy about that (while it wasn't as big a deal to me).

The rates were great and it was a good place to stay with the family. They didn't have any of the really cool shows or bars, so it seemed like a lot of the patrons (and especially those that stuck around during the day\/night) were of the 40+ variety that were looking to gamble (as they drank and\/or smoked - lots of smoking in the casino). The nice thing was that you could go right or left on the Strip and really quickly get to some fun stuff.

Shopping: The ""street of dreams"" stores and the pub seemed to be closed every time I headed into that direction. That was weird.

Show tickets: You can get show tickets at the concierge desk, but they recommended that I go to the actual hotel because they said the computer picks out the ""best seat"" in the front or back area (whichever you choose), but you won't know your actual seat until you get there if they're the ones that do it.

Internet use: People with laptops can get it for $15\/day in their room, or there are these old school machines in the lobby that are 25 cents a minute (with a $5 min). I didn't need to get online for that long, but I needed to check grades so I figured I might as well use up all the time I got for that $5.

The only real issue we had was related to housekeeping. When we left for the day, we put all our dirty towels that we wanted them to take on the floor. When my mom came back and went to dry her hands, she realized that they gave us two new towels and also hung up two wet ones..... one was dirty and wet, the other one was just a little wet. What the heck??? Right away we went down to the Check-In area and let them know about it. The woman there (Angela?) was very apologetic and ended up offering us a free trip to their buffet (first she looked to give us some money, but we had already pre-paid everything and didn't have a card on the room, so that was a no-go). We didn't particularly want to go back to the breakfast buffet, but we figured it'd be a good idea to do that before we take off (and have it be free instead of about $41).

Then we headed upstairs to take down the dirty towels and encountered housekeeping.... who (after asking if we were the people that complained) tried to tell us that the towels they hung up were all clean. Wtf? I didn't feel the towels, but I trust my mom's judgment on that a lot more than a stranger. Sorry, lady..... but that was weird. At that point I kind of wished I could just get some clean towels from them and have them leave.

Hotel is nice and clean..of course one of the older hotels on the strip, ESPECIALLY being next to the new City Center.
_Front Desk girl that checked me in could have been a little more approachable and friendly
_Deluxe room was like any other, except that they should DEFINITELY upgrade their old school tubey tv's to nice flat screen plasmas or somethin...get with it MC!
_Water pressure in the shower was a little TOO hard for my liking...but it felt nice on my back.
_We had a few ppl in our hallway were smokin a little grass ALL WEEKEND LONG...and swore that it was not seeping from under the door....COME ON!!!! hopefully they got fined
_Though their convenient store is 24 hours, which is definitely a plus, but a $7 bag of Sun Chips?!!?!?!? get outta here!
_The Big Chill or the Chill frozen drink store was NOT OPEN after 8pm..or at least from whenever I went to get one...so thanks a lot for stoppin by BUZZ!!! had to get my frozen daquiri\/margarita fix elsewhere!
_Diablos was dead...not what it LOOKS to be.  Last call @ 9:30pm? WOW! 

Now, there were a few things i loved about this hotel, and i do stress FEW.
_Location is perfect! right across from PH where i'm always at for Happy Hour @ the Halo Bar and eating up samiches from the Earl of Sandwich
_Their McDonalds in the food court serves a 50 piece chicken nugget meal, with 2 large drinks and 2 large fries for 14.99!!! 
_LOW RATES! cant beat that especially around the holidays

Would i stay here again? No.  I would ONLY CONSIDER this place if I WAS BROKE and if i came with a whole bunch of other broke ppl LOL.",0,0,0

They have respect for your own belongings left in the room. The price is pretty decent considering everything included, not to mention the location.

The size of the bathroom was adequate and the bed was really comfy.  We also received two complimentary buffet passes when we checked in and they could be used at a couple different buffets.

The staff was friendly but the check in desk needs some sort of organization - it literally is a free for all the way that it's set up now.

We knew it was a little older hotel going into it and that there would likely be some things that needed updated, but the cleanliness (or lack of) surprised us.  My husband and I couldn't afford to go anywhere too fancy for our honeymoon so the travel agent set us up at the Monte Carlo.  I'll start at the beginning.  It's not bad at all when you walk in.  In fact, it's quite nice!  The line to check in was about as long a line as I had EVER seen and took about 45 min. to get through, but that's ok, we had no agenda for the trip so we had time and didn't mind.  We were set up in a Monaco Suite on the 6th floor.  We also set up to upgrade to a spa room two days later when one became available for an add'l $50\/nite.  

Once we got to the room, upon first look it seemed older but not bad.  some of the furniture was older and the coffee table and nightstand had chips and pieces broken off, but it didn't bother us that much.  The carpet had some big black stains, but ok, we can live with that.  Once we started inspecting a little closer, tho, we weren't pleased.  The curtains had big round stains that looked like someone threw stuff at them.  All the pillows had yellow or black stains on the cases (not to mention the yellow staining under the cases!) and we had to call for new pillows.  the couch had some gross-looking stains that kept us from even sitting on it.  When we pulled back the covers on the bed, we found a couple of hairs.  We were tired and made the best of it for the first night, and at least we now had clean pillows.  

The next morning, however, we were done with that room.  We discovered some disgusting brown stains all over the ceiling of the bathroom that we were praying were water stains and not what we feared they were instead.  the loud neighbors and drunks coming home from the bars kept us up half the night.  We continued to find more and more cleanliness issues and we'd had enough.

Now, this is why I gave them 2 stars instead of 1.  Their service recovery was very good.  We called the first time and asked for a different room and the gal said she could get us into our spa room that day and discount our upgrade to only $30 add'l per nite.  i felt this was kind of dismal for the kind of problems we'd had, but we aren't the kind of ppl to make a big fuss just to get special treatment so we said fine.  They then called back later and apologized and comped us for our upgrade and asked if we could wait a little longer so they could wash and vacuum the carpets and make sure the room was clean.  This did impress us.

The spa room we moved into was better, definitely cleaner.  There were some issues, the wallpaper was stained and coming off in spots, the carpets still had black stains even after cleaning, the spa was not a spa at all but rather just a large tub, and there were hard water stains all over the marble around the tub, not to mention a point where the baseboards where severely warped and looked like someone had beat the crap out of them.  All in all, at least it was cleaner than the last room and we were happy for that.  The pillows and bed were clean too and no mysterious stains all over the place!

While their service recovery is very good and they did their best to give us a better experience on our honeymoon, we would likely not go back until they renovated or at least did better maintenance on their rooms, especially for the price we paid.",1,0,0

The location is incredible- next door to New York NY (& now the Park & T Mobile Arena), across from MGM, next door to Aria and you can take a quick tram to Bellagio! Currently, it is undergoing renovations and so there are some growing pains and many restaurants are closed. But that really doesn't matter in Vegas since there are a million close by! Primrose Restaurant is still open in the lobby, and it overlooks the pool area for a garden feel (Check out my review for that separately).
Back to Monte Carlo- being under construction also means the casino isn't as big with as many options, but they still have the most popular games. My biggest concern with construction in the casino is that Monte Carlo used to be one of the least smoky casinos on the Strip. But with all the construction cutting off air flow, it's pretty stagnant. I'm going to hope that gets fixed when renovations are done. 
The Old Monte Carlo pool had a lush garden feel, wave pool, and lazy river. It was awesome. I'm disappointed to see they have taken all of that out and have very basic rectangular pools now. Boring- and bound to get crowded in the summer. Since I was there during offseason, I didn't get to experience it yet, but you can see the new pools from rooms & the tram. 
My room was PLUSH- I had a friend cancel last minute so I had to change my room, but got to see the double room before switching. They all have long velvet couches along the window- perfect for a nap, I know, I took one there! Furniture is modern and has definitely been updated. The room I got moved to was on a Stay Well floor which I experienced before at MGM. There's aromatherapy, air purifier, vitamin infused shower, etc etc. AMAZING! Worth asking for! I have asthma & a Stay Well Room is the key to keeping me feeling normal. Finally, Uber & Lyft pick up in the same area (just outer curb) as taxis at Monte Carlos. Most other Vegas hotels separate them & make rideshare pick up FAR away from front of hotel. 
I can't wait to go back & hopefully give MC (or the Park, depending when I get back) a 5 star rating.",0,0,0

I understood going in, this would be a moderate priced casino and most likely would receive a moderate room... The most important thing to me would be location, cleanliness, friendliness and comfort just to name a few things. I am used to staying at more of  a 4 or 5 star resort in vegas, so again for this trip I went with the flow and was open to what would be offered.

We checked in on a saturday late afternoon and it was a breeze, friendly front desk staff, quick and efficient. The lobby is pretty nice, clean and open. Once we received our room keys, we went to our room and along the way, noticed the horrible carpet leading to our room. I understand that renovations will be taking place and with that you can understand a certain level of restraint on fixing things but come on...this is not a motel nor should guests have to see plain stains in sight and rips in the carpet.

The room had 2 queen beds, where the sheets were clean and beds made well. The linens in the bathroom were cheap and never replaced the same during the trip (3 days). I asked for additional toiletries since ours were never filled right upon arrival as well. The shower is something to be desired. Horrible shower head and when trying to lift the lever to get all the water pressure possible, I almost broke the nozzle. So, I called the front desk and they had someone come up and fix it the next morning. The room was clean, but I have a problem with damaged end tables, a chair that has hanging threads underneath and somewhat broken, carpet that is worn and very dated furnishings at any price. I have to say at least the room was clean. Now, i would have loved fresh drinking glasses in my room as i used the 2 that were there upon arrival and not once were they removed or freshened with replacements.  I had a huge issue with a comment that another guest made to me randomly as I was getting off the elevator....this woman told me she found bed bugs! her room was changed and no further problems....YIKES!!!!! I almost checked out. So, I went to my room and ripped the sheets up and checked everything!!!!! all was good in my room. I did go to the front desk and i voiced my concern.....to my surprise, the front desk guest relations attendant did not deny or agree to this report and rather commented that this could be possible, but not THEIR fault if it was true.....REALLY???? not the answer I  was looking for.

The pool was super enjoyable, water temp perfect and we opted for renting the lounge chair set for 2. What an awesome experience. The server we had was awesome and super friendly! the drinks were delish and I loved the pool!

Casino was fun...not a big area at all. I won on the slots which was good, but table dealers ere terrible except for 1 dealer who was incredible, nice and friendly! The cocktail servers are almost non existent unless you get in an area where 1 happens to be working. Food options are  ok, I don't prefer food malls, but starbucks is important to me and they have 2 plus a great coffee shop as well. I recommend Diablo's for mexican and get the nachos...THEY ARE AMAZING! the buffet is cheap in quality and not too good in my opinion.

One big draw for me was that the casino wasn't smokey or smelly. It actually smelled good if you can believe that, but it's true. 

POOL: The pool area was busy, and there were several pool options, including a wave pool and a lazy river. It had a family-friendly-Holiday Inn vibe to it, even though there were a lot of drunk twenty-somethings wandering around. The hot tub was dominated by people who would've been great models for Ed Hardy swimwear. 

ROOMS: Our room was nice with traditional decor. Mostly simple with white and gold decorations. Our room was clean, and the bed was very comfy. On our floor, it was a mix of people wanting to party and families. 

FOOD: The location of Monte Carlo is convenient to a lot of food options, but if you ever get lazy, the buffet is good and the food court is convenient. 

DEAL OR NO DEAL: There is the most amazing slot machine ever--The Deal or No Deal Slot Machine--and there is always a long line to play it, but once you get in, it is really fun and pays out well (for the most part.)

First of all, the construction. They did not tell us BEFORE we booked the room how obnoxiously loud it would be during the week days. They left us a note when we got there saying the noise would be ""left to a minimum"" and if a minimum means the sounds of a jackhammer right next to your face from 9 am - noon without interruption then then okay. 

They moved us to a different floor because of how absolutely ridiculous the sound was (there were about 50 people waiting down at guest services freaking out about the same thing when we went down) and we could still hear it from a room they told us would have no issue.

Guest services was basically unwilling to do anything in terms of making our experience there any better, which is completely unacceptable at almost $200\/night for a regular room. 

The food in the food court is pretty terrible. The table games are just okay. There's one $5 black jack table and good luck ever getting to play on it. There are VERY few waitressing going around to get people drinks while they are playing. 

Since there is construction there is no immediate pool for you to go, and they do tell you that you can use the MGM pool but that's ridiculously inconvenient, especially in 115 degree weather. 

The inside of the hotel is gross and outdated. Wallpaper is coming off of the walls, everything seems a little bit dirty, and the drawer space for a room that's supposed to fit four literally fit one person's luggage. I will say the beds are comfortable, but that's it. 

Also, the walls are PAPER thin. You will hear your neighbors conversations, and anybody walking through the hallway. 

There was also something massively wrong with the AC in this hotel because in both of our rooms it was unbelievably warm almost all the time. Other people in the hotel were also complaining of this. How are you not going to have good, working AC during the summer in the desert?!?

All in all, I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. Pick literally ANY other hotel on the strip and save yourself the struggle.",1,2,1

We had a very basic room - so basic there wasn't even a coffee maker.  Four of us shared a double room, but we were only given two sets of bath towels, and one bar of soap to share between the shower and sink.  The last day of our stay we did get another bar of soap, but never did get more towels.  Our room was actually very clean and well-kept. However the furniture was worn and the carpeting in such bad condition it had stretched so much it was buckling in our room and all throughout the hallways.

We arrived around 9pm and checked in quickly. Our room was the very last room on the 8th floor. View of parking garage. There was some long black curtains with a stand hanging in front of the door to the room across from us and it looked like they just needed a place to stick it and decided next to our room! Also, there was a tray of beer and old food that looked like it had been sitting there for days. We had to walk around it each time we went to our room. 

The room: BLAH. The floor was stained (looked like many people had thrown up on it over the years...) there was candy on the floor from the previous guests. Other than that it seemed clean enough. Nothing special at all, no fridge, no wifi, and all the outlets but one were taken so no charging your phone next to the bed! The safe didn't work, it was open and wouldn't shut. I called the front desk and they sent up security who demanded my ID like a criminal. They said any time they open the safe they have to check ID. I proceeded to tell him the safe was OPEN and nothing was in it so why do I need to show ID? He snapped at me that if I had a problem with their policies to take it up with the front desk. I did and they gave me a $50 credit. They also had to send up 2 more people before the safe got fixed. Also complained about the food sitting outside of our room for over a day and they finally came and picked it up. 

Went to the pool the next day. It was good enough but I've been to better in Vegas. Also the wave pool was dirty lots of ""debris"" in it. Came back to the room and it had only been halfway cleaned. Again called to the front desk and they offered to send someone up but at that point we were trying to get ready for a night out so we declined. On our way out we heard someone else on our floor say their room was only halfway cleaned too. The next day we had a housekeeping supervisor come to our room and tell us she thoroughly cleaned our room. Parts of the room looked spotless and then parts were still not done like the day before. 

Last day for check out I wanted to just do express checkout, reviewed my bill and the $50 credit was not applied. Had to wait in a very long line to speak with someone to get it applied. Overall I was dissatisfied with our trip and I will not be staying here again.

There was no refrigerator (so sad when I had leftovers of the most awesome steak ever), no coffee maker (I guess because Sambalate, Starbucks, and McD's were on the premises), and the in-room safe required payment.  

Be aware that you will stand in extremely long lines during check-in and check-out hours (try to use express check-out) and the elevators are backed up during these times, as well (we waited 15 minutes and decided to catch the elevators going up to come down).",1,0,0

AWESOME THINGS:
1) Love the casino!! It has the best slot machines (penny slots!!) and I usually do pretty good here. Emerald Falls and Star Wars slots are awesome and I'm a sucker for the bonus rounds. Haven't played anything else really except for Pai Gow and I did pretty good at that too.

2) Loved that they had 6 elevators for each section. I stayed at the Excalibur once and it took me 45 minutes to get to the 1st floor waiting for 1 elevator. They had tvs in them and went fast. 

3) Their beds are awesome! Very comfy and give you plenty of pillows.

4) The tramway goes from here to Bellagio and Aria...LOVE!! Definitely beats walking over there. And we got to see the fountain show. :)

NOT SO AWESOME THINGS:
5) They charge $20 resort fee each night for what??? This isn't Bellagio or Venetian. We came at spring break time and it was so packed of  jersey shore douche's and I came to realize I was older than I thought. Note to self: don't come to the strip during spring break. So, I think the resort fee was a rip off for not using the pool. Even using the pool I think it's a rip. 

6) They don't have any food places open past 11 in the casino except for the Cafe but blah. This is Vegas people!! That's when the party gets started!! WTF? So, we walked over to New York, New  York and had some good grub over there. That needs to change.

7) Ok, this one is kinda weird but their shower head was the weirdest shower head I've ever seen. No pressure and had 4 little holes for water to come out. Super annoying when you have thick hair and you're trying to get the shampoo out and it takes FOREVER. Also, no fan in the bathroom. Ugh.

8) Finally, the one that really irritated me...NO WIFI!!!! Seriously? I don't get it. You need wifi for Vegas!!!

So in conclusion, I won't be back to Monte Carlo to stay overnight. For being a moderate priced hotel on the strip, you kinda expect more. I had a better experience at Golden Nugget!! They need to upgrade or something to make that resort fee worth it.",4,0,0

Since we booked our rooms late for NYE, this hotel is one of the few hotels that still have available rooms. The room service was mediocre. We needed 2 extra bath towels and had to call housekeeping three times in 1 hour but we never got the towels we needed. My cousins had to settle with the face towels they have to dry themselves. When we got back later that night, we had our towels hanging at a bag outside the room. The next morning, the maid opened our room and yelled housekeeping which is enough to wake everyone up.

It's location is excellent. It's within close walking distance to Planet Hollywood, which is a great place for food and shopping. It's also a short cab ride away from any other main hotels and shopping venues on the strip.

There were many issues with the room, broken drawer on dresser, shower head that was far to low for an adult (called front desk to get it adjusted, as they said they could fix it and I couldn't figure it out)  they never came and attempted to fix it or if they did they couldn't fix it so they just left it.

This makes it difficult for the bartenders because many people have come to expect free drinks when they gamble and it seems they blame the bartenders for the changed policy.  It is not any worse at the Monte Carlo vs anywhere else on the strip, but we decided to just start gambling in Fremont.  We will try to stay at the new MGM hotel when it renovations are complete.

On the Plus Side: 
-Very nice hotel staff-everyone from the valet parker to the bellman to the front desk. They were accommodating, friendly and they seemed to have a genuine interest in assisting you. 
-Reasonably priced 
-Different pools (wave pool, lazy river, hot tub, regular pool) 
-Good location, go to the right or left when you walk out and either way you'll find fun 
-Decent, clean enough room (although nothing special) 
-A handful of different food choices in the hotel 

On the Down Side: 
-DO NOT let the reservation guy on the phone tell you that the construction workers were all laid off and no more construction is going on-What a line of bs!!! When I got there I found out that not only IS there construction happening 24\/7 but it's around 3\/4 of the perimeter of the hotel AND the biggest construction project in all of North America-WTF???! 
-If you don't want to be annoyed as hell hearing other guests next door to you, make sure you request a room that is NOT conjoined with another. 
I had the joy of hearing those opposite me talking loudly at 7AM (I'm not a morning person) as if they were in the room with me which they almost were. (granted, the staff were cool about getting me another room) 
-Be sure to get alternate directions if you are driving. It was really frustrating to see the hotel practically right in front of me when I got off the freeway after a 4 hour drive and not be able to reach it due to the construction. The road you would usually turn on is blocked and I had to sit in LOTS of traffic and had to figure out how to get there another way. Frustrating! 
-I don't know where the ""wheel of free stuff"" was that someone else here mentioned but when I was there I got nothing complimentary at all despite the fact that the friendly front desk man knew it was my birthday and we had a very nice chat . Aren't you supposed to at least get a free buffet or a few gambling bucks?? 
-Last but DEFINITELY not least: The pool noise. Mind you, it's great to have pool choices like I mentioned above but the music is ALWAYS BLASTING. I like music like everybody else but this is NOT relaxing if you want to lie there and chill with a book--- and if you have a hangover-forget it!! Also, it would have been nice if they had mixed up the music more. It was all hip hop despite the crowd being somewhat older in general. At least shake it up with some 80's tunes or rock or something... 

Overall, not a bad choice but if any of the above are issues with you or if you're a light sleeper, you might want to stay somewhere else.",1,1,1

Checking in was easy, the person we got was nice, quick and helpful when I asked about a concert that was happening at the Park Theater. 

The room was nice. Beds were comfy and clean and the bathroom was nice too. I didn't really like how the windows were a bit dirty from the outside but I would imagine that would be a little hard to clean. Lol the shower head felt great, I loved the pressure of the water. The only thing I didn't really like is how the doors are soooo loud. Every time our neighbor would get into their room it felt like they were coming into mine cause of how clear it sounded!

We encountered a pretty rude room cleaner, she came in without knocking the day we were going to check out...Im sure she thought we would have been out of there by then but we had late check in... I was in the bathroom...she could have knocked.

One thing is that registration and concierge is piss poor.  Poor service and knowledge.  I asked them both if anything was going on and the registration girl said she really didn't know (she SHOULD know) and the concierge guy (young, white guy, skinny) directed me to ""shows"".

From the moment I entered the hotel to the moment I left, the staff was needlessly formal and kind of full of themselves. Which would be somewhat ok if the service and the quality of the hotel reflected appropriately, but it didn't. The room was superficially clean. That means that at first glace, it's nice enough, but if you dig a bit deeper, it's not that nice. For example, there was a long black hair stuck to the shower wall (which definitely wasn't mine or my boy's as we both have short hair) and then I even pulled a long blonde hair out of a ""clean"" towel.

The walls are thin. All night I could hear a family in a room to one side of us and what sounded like 10 teenagers in the room to the other side. 

The pillows on the bed drove me crazy. They were all so big that it felt like I had two pillows under my head when it was only one. I ended up loosing all pillows and sleeping without one. Fun times. 

I know a resort fee is kind of the norm in Vegas, but that doesn't make them any less stupid. They cover things that most people aren't going to use, like the gym, and daily newspapers. Oh, and internet. And when they say ""internet,"" they mean a 1ft ethernet cable. That's right. A cable. 

The pool area is nice. They have a wave pool and a lazy river but you have to buy the inner tubes! Seriously?

The issues were non-stop from the minute we valeted our car to the minute we left this dump.  We were greeted by our valet driver, nice gentleman, very friendly and welcoming.  Cue the 80 y\/o bellhop who couldn't differentiate between ""This set of luggage goes to one room and this set of luggage goes to another one""  which by the way, he still managed to screw up which bags went where and had the audacity to be incredibly rude to my friend (b\/c I was on the phone with him when his bags, or lack there of, was delivered) Imagine this dialogue taking place while impeding a line of cars who are trying to valet.  We finally hop in line to check in, which essentially resembled waiting in line at the DMV.  I pay for the other portion of my room and upon entry, I find this super grimey q-tip and a pile of hair.  Looks like housekeeping half-assed their duties for the day.  So my boyfriend and I decided to inspect the rest of the room cause we could only imagine what else housekeep DID NOT clean.  Enter the pile of stale crusty chips under the table.  SOOOOO DONE at this point!!  I'm given a dirty ass room with TWO BEDS not ONE KING SIZE BED b\/c apparently it wasn't available based on the price I paid; felt like I was at a glorified summer camp.  I hit up front desk via phone, expressed my concerns, and offered a new room and was instructed to do back down stairs to pick up my new room key.  So I jump into another DMV line again and decided to ask again if there was a king size bed available and sure enough there was, but it was handicap accessible room on the 21st floor.  FINE....WHATEVER....WE WILL TAKE IT. We inspected the room, looked clean, we were exhausted, we'll accept it.  

Fast forward to the next morning...upon jumping in the shower, the damn nozzle hose that connects to the shower  head full on BREAKS and water is EVERYWHERE and the shower drain is painfully slow.  If it wasn't for the fact that it was my girl's birthday, I would've demanded my money back and booked it back to San Diego.  At this point, I'm beyond livid and all I see is red.  I use my best grown up voice I can muster, explained my concerns AGAIN and how deeply frustrating this room situation has been.  To remedy my complaint, they gave me a $50 dining room credit and sent engineering up my room. Did that generosity appease me?  Slightly, but not entirely.  Cue dinner.  I'm from Southern Cali aka home the original authentic Mexican tacos and was I impressed by the meal, not really.  $20 for a plate of crappy tacos with stale tortillas that gave me the runs (I know, TMI, apologies on my end!)...OVER IT. 

And funny how everything we did OUTSIDE of the hotel, we had a blast.  Everything with the hotel vicinity, sucked ass.    

We finally make it to our last day.  Car pulls up, there's a minor but noticeable scratch on my the rear bumper of my car. My boyfriends pissed, I'm pissed, and I just want to get the heck outta there and never come back again.  For the sake of causing a huge scene which my boyfriend wanted to do and given how crappy our experience was here, I should've let him do it.  At least it would've made me feel better.  

Long story short, never will I ever come back here again.  We should've stayed at Mandalay Bay. I'm sure they don't have exploding showers, 80 y\/o crotchety bell hops, and clumps of hair and dirty q-tips waiting for you when you walk in.",2,0,0

Also our reservation was wrong & they gave us two handicap rooms with one bed instead of regular two queens in them. They did bring a cot to each room but that was not what was reserved! They offered us the choice to swap into the correct rooms in the morning but when we called @ 11 am they said rooms wouldn't be available until maybe as late as 4pm.

HOWEVER, I would like to say that my rating for the Monte Carlo is not based in comparison to luxury resorts like the Venetian or Wynn, but rather in comparison to my expectations of what a 3 star hotel should be. 

With that being said, I would definitely stay here again. I got a great $39\/night deal for four nights thanks to my M-life membership. Even with the dreaded $16\/day resort fee the total bill was still less than $250 after tax which I was more than satisfied with. If you will be using a debit card to book the hotel, you should know that they put a $100\/night hold on your card. This is important in case you overdraft your account or worse, your card gets rejected. Save yourself that humiliation and plan on that money disappearing for a few days. 

Check-in process was fast and Check-out even faster thanks to Express Checkout either through your television or by simply dropping one of their Express Checkout Cards into any of their Express Checkout boxes! So easy! I never witnessed any long lines at the front desk as there were always lots of employees working it.

Our deluxe (standard) room on the 22nd floor was nice. I was happy to see that our TV wasn't from the 80s but instead was a flat screen plasma with crisp picture and sound for when my boyfriend had to lounge around in front of it while I got ready for our days\/nights. The bed was super comfy and loaded with pillows and clean enough sheets. I say clean enough only because I'm not one of the whacko's that bring a black light for inspection of every inch of the room. If I take a gander at my white sheets and they are exactly that, white, then I'm GOOD. One thing I hate about standard hotel rooms is the lack to lighting! Why can't any of them offer more than just a few dim lamps in the main room!? 

The bathroom was clean and came with your standard toiletries: hand soap, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion. The sink did seem to drain a little slow which was a little annoying but nothing to cry about. The toilet was a little scary. You just tap the handle with the lightest touch to flush and it makes a loud, explosive noise every time like you're gonna get sucked in with it. Oh and yes I did experience the crazy shower head pressure as well! It would be nice to be able to turn that down a bit but I didn't really mind that much because it felt kind of like a jacuzzi jet on my tired back muscles. 

Maid service was friendly and fast and took care of everything they should have. Bell hop was very courteous and friendly as well. Don't forget to tip! 

24hr McDonald's, Sbarro's, Subway and casual dining Cafe Restaurant right in our hotel? Awesome!! There is also two Starbucks Cafes, a Big Chill (alcohol slushy stand), a Cupcakery (yummy gourmet cupcakes), Minus 5 Ice bar, and at least four other restaurants and bars right there in the hotel for your Vegas pleasure. 

Location is awesome because it is in walking distance to the NYNY, Excalibur, and MGM. Once you're at the Excalibur you can use the free tram to get to Mandalay Bay or Luxor. It's also right across the street from the popular M&M World. If you're headed the other way on the strip you can use the free tram right in the Monte Carlo hotel to get to Aria or Bellagio. Once you're at the Bellagio you are in walking distance to Paris and Cesar's Palace! That tram is awesome because it comes every three minutes so you never have to wait and its also never crowded! It is located up a few long escalators at the end of the Street of Dreams shops on the casino level. 

Last thing to note is that this hotel isnt overly huge, making it simple to get from Point A to B and pretty difficult to get lost. There are many elevators and we never had to wait longer than two minutes to hop on one at any given time of the day.

I'll be back!",6,1,3

Which was done really well and you can even watch the wedding over the internet.  It was broadcast live during the ceremony and also saved so you can watch it again later.  That was nice.

So other than the wedding, the hotel stay was awful!  They gave us a room with two queen beds since they were out of King rooms which was fine.  However the beds were so bad that if one of us moved in the bed it moved the entire bed.  It was like sleeping in a water bed.  One small movement rocked the whole bed.  Also the pillows were horrible as well.  They were so thick that I couldn't even rest my head on them.  My husband used the small corner of the pillow as they were all this way.

And don't stay at this hotel if you want to lay out by the pool.  We went out to the pool and it was a joke.  First of all we went at high noon which is prime sun time and the entire pool was covered with shade from all the surrounding buildings and construction.

Our last visit to Sin City was over 8 years ago and we knew a lot had changed since then.  If we were to head to Vegas we knew we wanted to do it right and have the steak dinner, the shows and the entire Vegas package.  Our last visit we stayed at the Venetian (which I loved) and although super nice it came with a price and we were unable to afford the amenities of the shows and everything else that Vegas has to offer.  After scouring the web and reading a ton of reviews we settled on the Monte Carlo for this trip.

The Monte Carlo is an older hotel but still carries itself with great luxury.  The hotel is still modern in its design and really does feel as upscale as many of the newer places in my opinion.  They have a number of restaurants on the premises and although most reviews I read said to stay away we found a great steakhouse and coffee shop that were fantastic.  Upon check-in we found that the room choice we had made were limited in availability and thus we ended up on the 7th floor which really hindered the view of the strip.  I was fine with this as we really weren't planning on spending much time in the room themselves although higher is definitely the way to go.  The room was spacious and nicely furnished, the water pressure was great in the shower (the tub unfortunately had a slow drain that wouldn't keep the water).  The one downfall to the room is the fact that the Monte Carlo only currently offers a wired internet connection in the rooms (our didn't work) and WiFi is only in the 1st two floors (casino and spa\/pool areas).  It was unfortunately colder and quite windy during our visit so the Pool was never even an option on this visit.

Despite having a long line at check-in, the process was smooth and seamless and we got through it in just a few minutes.  The express checkout is nice and can be done in numerous way as well including through the TV, the kiosks downstairs, via text message, calling a automated number on your room phone or filling out a card and leaving it at the desk downstairs.  

The Monte Carlos also houses a number of stores throughout as well as being the current home of The Blue Man Group show.  The also house the Minus 5 Bar, Ignite Bar and upscale eateries such as Andre's and Brand Steakhouse.  They offer Valet parking in front or self parking in a structure to the rear between Frank Sinatra and Las Vegas Blvd (although it was a bit hard to find unless you know where it is.

For what we got and the time we spent here, I feel that the Monte Carlo was a great value and a definite good stay.  The casino I found a bit lacking overall compared to some of the other nearby hotels but being as I am not a big gambler this was not much of an issue.  I would definitely stay here again for future visits.",21,12,16

Requested an upgrade room but basically received the exact same room, on an upper floor which would have been a suite, if the adjoining room was used. 
Granted, this is an older hotel, so there are not as many nice things to see or do, but you're free to visit the higher end resort casinos without having to fork over the money for it, so why not save a bit on a room that will be used mostly for bathroom breaks and naps?

Visited the pool are but there was an incredible crowd, and the water appeared to be murky from all those people with drinks and suntan lotion on, plus a lot of kids, so I passed taking a swim (impossible with the weekend's crowd). Cabanas available for more privacy, if you want. Not really a happening place.

Slots were not generous but you know the house always wins.

Wish the rooms had more lighting in the bathrooms.

Simple bathroom amenities, eco-conscious (they want guests to re-use towels - admit it - you do at home so why not here too?).

We weren't even planning on having their buffet since we prefer Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon but we were playing slots and happened to see the buffet.  ""Why not?"" we think and since there were three price tiers, we wanted to know WHICH complimentary buffet they were offering.  So hubby goes to concierge and asks- ""hey, which buffet can we use the deal that you offered?""  only to be told that there is NO such thing, we were never offered the buffets and sorry for the misunderstanding but we'll give you one buffet for the mistake.

So wifey goes to concierge for clarification.  I was told by an assistant manager named Lucero,  that hubby said that buffets were included in the deal when booking the room and that he was asked for proof to honor the free buffets.  Hubby says that never came up.  He said, she said.  

WTF.

Bottom line is - honor what the hell your front desk agent promised.  We don't care about your damn buffet as I'm sure it's a pretty standard one compared to others.  What I care about is how YOU MADE YOUR GUESTS FEEL LIKE LIARS and like we made a big deal out of getting two free buffets that we did not even want!  We travel A LOT and have been to many, many establishments that have top notch service.  This is certainly not one of them.   To top it all off, the GM, Charles' explanation of ""well, we certainly don't give in fully to guests but try to meet you halfway by offering you one buffet"" is the most laughable customer service line I've heard in a long time.

One morning at 5:00 AM there was a flood next door, and the idiots turned on an industrial shop vac right ourside our door to suck out the water. Sounded like a jet engine.  

No pool, and the so-called access to other resort's pools meant an hour walk or an Uber just to go to the pool. Not feasible. Do not visit here until construction is complete. As for me, I'd never go back.",1,0,0

Stayed on the 23rd floor and had a strip view, it had easy access to aria and Bellagio and the casino wasn't good or bad. The pool area looked nice but was way packed mid week so I couldn't even imagine trying to be down there on the weekend. Price wasn't bad on paper but the Internet cord they provide didn't work, the shower had a ton of mildew, the hallway on our floor was always wet. Really wet. The aroma gives you a headache, I would rather just smell the smoke. My wife and I both cut our feet on the tac strip in the room. I called downstairs to let them know about the issues and told them ahed of time I'm not looking for anything free just giving the info, and they were rude.

ROOM:
checked in at 4-5pm and all the highfloor king bed rooms were already out. so we paid $5 to upgrade our room so we could get a king bed. room itself was very spacious. had a bathroom with a vanity mirror, bathtub\/shower, and hairdryer included. 

* NO FRIDGE in any of the rooms, only in the suites. :( and of course no microwave either. 

our room was facing the strip which was cool but right below us was Diablo and the music was pounding loud despite our high floor room. i can't imagine how loud it was for the rooms below us. thankfully, i was still able to catch some zzz's but if you're a light sleeper, it's probably not a good idea.

no construction noise where my room was located though since it was not next to the construction area but while walking to the parking structure, i did not see or hear construction going on. maybe they had a holiday or they changed the hours of construction. 

POOLS & PARKING:
pools are closed due to construction but you are given the choice of going to mandalay bay or mgm for their pool. parking is free with your room key for both hotels too. 

*make sure to get the parking deal!!!!!! 

TRAM:
there is a tram from monte carlo\/aria to aria\/crystal shops and the bellagio\/vdara. i honestly loved this feature and would stay in monte carlo again just for it. it's free even if you aren't staying in any of the listed hotels but it's way more convenient if you are. :)",3,0,1

There wasn't anything to special about the room; it was quite standard. The only thing I feel the room was lacking was a coffee maker and fridge. Seriously I can't recall ever staying at a hotel which lacked these amenities. Although I did not have a strip view, I must say that my view was awesome because I was facing the fabulous Monte Carlo pool and the extraordinary City Center! Beautiful in the daylight and absolutely stunning at night! Housekeeping was on point and the front desk was pleasant. My only complaint regarding personel would probably be the snotty ass concierge chick (excuse the tude but she almost got herself embarrassed but I was in a really good mood). The Monte Carlo Casino has to be my favorite on the strip thus far. It's very comfortable without having too young or too old of a crowd; and the music is on point!. Monte Carlo is not a bad choice.

The sales department was very professional and easy to deal with.  The casino has good location close to the City Center and almost in the middle of the strip.  On most vacation search engines Monte Carlo is listed as a 4 star hotel.  Prices were very reasonable for this resort and casino and shops are nice. The gambling areas are not crammed together so you dont get that hemmed in feeling.  The rooms are very large, but are pretty no frills as far as I was concerned.  A keurig coffee brewer, two bottles of water and a flat screen tv were the highlights as far as ameneties are concerned.  One huge flaw of this hotel is the lack of WiFi and their ethernet internet access is not covered by the resort fee charge.

Overall this is a good value casino.  As part of the MGM family you can stay here and take advantage of MGM's frequent free show ticket promotions.  Monte Carlo and Luxor are the two cheapest 4 star hotels in the MGM group and probably on the strip.  The guests staying at Monte Carlo were not the rowdy low brow bunch found at the Luxor, so if you are looking for a decent place to stay with good location and good prices, Monte Carlo is a good candidate.",5,0,4

- Great location on the strip and easily accessible to NY NY, MGM, Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, M&M world, Coke building, Ross, Food Court.

- CHEAP prices!  If you have an MGM player's club card, call into Casino Marketing to make your reservation.  The last time I stayed at Monte Carlo, I got super cheap rates!  The price to stay here alone is worth it!

- Gambling is great!  Finally a casino where you can actually WIN some money and will not rape your wallet royally.  The only problem is trying to peel yourself away when you're winning lol.

Cons:
- Rooms feel a little older.  It seems as though the rooms on the 20th floors on up are a little newer.  The hallway flooring are definitely cleaner & sheets seems cleaner.  I also had to switch rooms after my first night because my room door, safe and lights were not working. 

- Room walls were also very thin.  We could hear the couple arguing next door all the way up until 5:30 am.  Good lord, give it a rest, you're in Vegas- what is there to argue about?!

The price was right for me, under $100 including resort fee, but was a bit far from the ""Hot Zone"" further up towards Bellagio and Linq.

The restaurants were all OK - I tried the Asian fusion and it was good but pricey.  They had sushi at the Chinese (?) restaurant, but I didn't give it a whirl.  I did not try the buffet but the price was reasonable, included drinks, and wasn't super busy.

The casino is typical but they have a nice lounge in there (hit lounge?) with awesome live music. Be aware there is a $30 per day resort fee which significantly bumps up the room rate as a %. Take that into account when cross shopping because it's sort of a hidden fee and not all hotels charge the same fee if any. I read online that the fee covers internet, the fitness centre, fax, and 2 water bottles, etc. I didn't even get any water bottles. Guess that was taken out of the budget. The pool was closed too.

I was calling to request the rooms I booked be on the same floor, and prices to upgrade room as well as a question about a show. Well, crappy customer service the guy had a attitude an without notice transferred me elsewhere for the show an didn't even answer my other questions so I had to call back an wait on hold again !

We got one of the suites it was ok had a crappy view of nothing out the window and hot water wasn't working in our 2nd bathroom and shower head sucked and extremely small t.vs. Also their pool has been out of service for months and will continue to be so that's a HUGE inconvenience they make u walk to mgm or Mandalay Bay which r both far walks then u have ro walk through the whole place to the back to the pool then you get there an are told 2 people per room key and we had 3 people an 1 key we didn't need  2 keys since we were all sticking around eachother. Would of been nice of Monte Carlo to let guests know that!!! Also didn't know until check in that on the high floors our water would be turned off from 12-6 or 7!!!! It was also nice to have someone else's food carts (3 of them) in front of our door all 3 days we were there!!! Oh not to mention our room keys to 2 of our rooms stopped working out of no where so we had to walk down to the front an wait in their lovely long SLOW line again to get new keys which made us late to where we were going. Also we noticed when walking through the hotel some parts smelt like sewer or something real bad. Walls are paper thin so be prepared to hear vacuuming and people's toilets. Ahh let's not forget the construction who started bright and early every day and the boss man down there screaming at his crew. That was nice.

I have travelled all over the world and everyone always has things that bug them. Monte Carlo is very plain nothing spectacular. If this was in the middle of anywhere you would think this place is amazing but for vegas and from what I have seen in other vegas hotels just from wandering around... plain is the word. The look from the outside at night is beautful and it is also very pretty during the day. The sculptures and detail outside are nice. The staff is friendly and quite helpful. The rooms were you know decent, bed were comfortable we never watched tv cuz we were either drunk or out. There is no wireless for free, the shower wasnt so great hot water was scarce. I noticed other ppl had fridges we didnt.  One thing that did bug me was a ""resort"" fee we had to pay per person upon check out... I didnt get that .. we paid to stay there why did i have to pay a resort fee.... big fail on that!

We ate at Diablos and had the margaritas. Upon reading the reviews we really didnt have any complaints like many others did. The staff was friendly we were seated right away and prices were reasonable. The food was decent and margaritas were great 12 bucks a pitcher. Left there drunk lol. 

NOW we recieved complimentary buffett .. since there were 3 of us 2 of us were free and it was 12 bucks extra per person for unlimited champagne which we took advatnage of. I think it is completely worth it. The food isnt amazing but it is decent its a nice way to fill up on food and booze for cheap ...


In reality the location of Monte Carlo is awesome .. would I stay here again? Probably not because I have now seen what other hotels look like and offer from wandering around Vegas.

One of the better ways to get to T-Mobile Arena is through Monte Carlo.

It looked nice inside.  I walked through the place, all tables looked busy and buzzing.  I ended up make a $5 high limit slot bet and lost...  I walked over to the Sports Books to make three bets, two of them were for Chicago Blackhawks to win the Stanley Cup and one was for the Chicago Bears to win the SuperBowl (yes, you can make fun of me for that one now).  However, I was trying to make another bet (for Vegas Golden Knights to make the playoffs) and they did not have a line for that one.  I found it a bit odd.  Apparently, that bet was available prior to the start of the season, but not once the season started... Go Figure!

Roulette was fun too!  $5 low limits, let me gamble for a good half an hour.

My husbands company had decided on the Monte Carlo for the Christmas Party. First off, their parking is very easy to access.   From the 15, you take Frank Sinatra Drive and turn onto Rue de Monte Carlo.  Their self parking structure is right there... no need to drive on the busy Las Vegas Blvd.  Hooray!  

Since we were there a little early, we had a little bit on fun 'contributing' to their electric bill.  Since they had recently moved the Blue Man Group show from the Venetian to here, they had a  little parade of instruments going through the casino as to promote their show starting soon.  It was very entertaining!  

It was party time... and very easy to find the ballrooms designated for the company.  It was beautifully decorated for the Christmas season with many trees.  This worked out great for a photo op!  The huge chandeliers also lit the rooms nicely as they weren't too bright but just enough.  

They had set up several different food stations which consisted of a variety of salads, rolls, chicken, beef, baked potato bar and beautiful dessert table.   The potato bar was excellent as they had shrimp and crap meat they would sauté  for you.  I actually skipped the potato and just had the shrimp, crab and some mushrooms.  Delightful!   If you know me, I always look forward to dessert time.  Unfortunately they had set this up a little too far in advance.  The cakes and cookies were very very dry.  Bummer for me.  

The waitstaff did a phenomenal job!!  They were right there to clear away any plates, refill drinks and just give you a smile!

+++ The restaurants offer a very good meal at a reasonable price. However, any time you order alcohol of any kind, the bill goes from reasonable to are you kidding me?
+++ The food court is not terrible. It offers a quick meal at a fairly decent price for Vegas prices.
+++ Every amenity that you wish is pretty centrally located except for the specialty restaurants. In some casino resorts, you literally feel like you are on a Death March through a smoke filled desert to get any place. Not here!
CONS --- The rooms. They are sadly in need of a remodel. Our double queen on the 28th  floor had one chair at a broken desk, no power strip, no mini bar or frig, and no coffee in the room. Yes, I realize the corporation doesn't want you to hang out in the room, but in America you expect certain amenities especially when comps on the Strip have those features. Is it too much to ask for at least two comfortable chairs in the room?
--- Geez, Louise! It's not even the height of tourist season, and the staff is already full of attitude. The security guard practically told us to get out when the pool was closing. The food service worker at the food court got completely snippy with my poor spouse when he couldn't hear what he did and very politely asked him to repeat what he said. The restaurant worker went cold when we asked if Canadian whiskey was a well drink. My room key de-magnetized and the desk clerk acted like it was my fault. No sorry for my trouble. No nothing.

Everything went downhill from there. 
The front desk attendant Alan was condescending and VERY RUDE! He informed us they had no more king beds available and we checked in at 12 noon, not late by any means. Then that the pool was closed and we would be able to access the pool at Mandalay Bay or MGM, not really a bad thing as they both have very nice pools but the inconvenience of travel took about a extra hour and half from our relaxing time and there are only shuttles on the hour and we were pressed for time . 
As I expressed my annoyance of not knowing about the construction and that the information should be on the website so we would be able to make a decision based on that information, Alan very rudely told me he had gone on and read it himself and spoke to me like I was an idiot. His response was, you are locals you didn't know about the remodeling? As I replied no I didn't . He said well maybe you should keep up on local news? 
I really just wanted to get on with our short stay , so we just took our room and left . I did go back on bookings. Com to check if I had missed all the information he said was there , I have used booking so many times so I thought I could have missed it because all my info is there so just a few clicks and I'm done . Not one mention of any remodeling or closure are on there!!!! So Alan lied right to our face. as I'm sure he is having to deal with a ton of complaints due to all but I did not appreciate his attitude at all ! 
The construction noise really didn't bother us . It was like a loud humming fan and we actually liked the noise that drowns out the partying late nighters going through the halls.

Not only did they over charge me $560 plus for my stay, they charged me an extra $150 at check in.

So yes try to go for the 2nd floor level parking to avoid a sauna experience inside the elevator.

Check-in: We were pleasantly surprised that we were allowed to check-in early (around 12 noon).

There are 2-3 sets of elevators depending what floor your room is and it located just ahead of their gift shop, to the right.

Elevators were pretty quick, despite large crowds. We were given a room on the 12th floor. It was overlooking New York New York next door and the construction site.

The shower\/bathroom was clean also, did not see any molds in this unit. The water pressure was incredible but loud. Also, you hafta' hold down the flusher for a bit to flush all the way. Shower had no issues except that since the water pressure was on point, it made it really loud. Think Raging Rapids coming out of the shower. Their shampoos and stuff smelt good, like body wash for babies. *smiles* The walls are also paper thin here, so I can verify with the other reviews that you can hear your next door neighbor's conversations (and toilet flushes). Also if your neighbor goes in and out of their room in the middle of the night, you can definitely hear that as well. Construction noises were barely heard in the morning hours.

Pool: Unfortunately we weren't able to go swimming since it started raining and they closed it down. But from the looks of it, the pool area was awsome. They also had a DJ playing house music . Darn Rain!! Maybe next time.

They have a free tram that takes you to Aria and Bellagio. From the pool entrance, look to your right and see the sign for street of dreams. This will connect you to the free tram. Follow the signs.

Casino: They had some ok slots in there, didn't play the tables. Blue Man Group is the featured entertainment at this hotel. They also have the Minus5 ice lounge. M Life counter is on the right side from the center of the casino if your into the player's club stuff.

They have a food court that includes mcdonalds, starbucks, and others. ( Some guy comp'ed everyone's startbucks purchases the morning we checked-out. Thank you man, whoever you are!!)

Staff: All were very accommodating and welcoming.

I like the fact that the Monte Carlo isn't a huge hotel resort where it becomes a daunting task to get around. It's pretty cut and dry and you have access to everything from the lobby. I like that! You can get in and out, even with crowds, in no time. I love the fact that the Monte Carlo is centrally located on the Strip. All the major casinos are all in walking distance. I hope the construction is completed soon, as I will be staying at Monte Carlo again. I am excited to see what the new venue\/area they are constructing will look like.

Check Out: It was a breeze, you also have the option for express check-out, but noone was in line at the check-out counter during that time, so we did it the regular way. Complimentary flight check-in and printing of boarding passes is also available. You can do this in the area next to the Bell Desk.

We had a wonderful time at the Monte Carlo. No issues at all. I will be coming back again. 4 stars only since I had to bring my own pocket router to get wifi in the room. (Wi-fi is available on the first 2 floors).

Thanks for a good time Monte Carlo!",0,0,0

This was the first time we have stayed here and will stay again for sure. Not overpriced for what you get. We were very surprised at the quality for the price. Staff is great. 

Casino is nice and honestly pretty quiet compared to the rest. The bars in the casino are nice and pretty much around the same price as other places. Most have great happy hour prices on food and drinks. 

Restaurants are all pretty good but, The Pub is amazing and is great for watching sports! Also has great food and a great happy hour setup! Diablo's Cantina is on the corner of the resort and we go there every time we go to Vegas so, obviously it's great as well.  

They have a nice walkway that has some good shops and a tram that takes you from MC to Aria to Bellagio. 

Only complaint I have is the WiFi is pretty much only the first two floors (that's what the sign says) Which won't  bother most people since they're not in the room much anyways. But, for the cyber junkies it wouldn't be very good I guess. I was fine with it coming and going from our room. We were on the 22nd floor so we didn't expect super great WiFi anyways.

- USA Today is not delivered to your room. It is in the elevator lobby area.
- There is no wifi. You get an Ethernet cable.
- No easily accessible outlets. Even those that were hard to reach were in use. You had to unplug something if you wanted to use an outlet.
- Elevator doors had grease and residue on the outsides. It appeared as though the metal had not had maintenance in a very long time.
- Subjective but the bed was extremely uncomfortable. The pillows are hard and extremely thick.
- TV remote didn't work 50% of the time. The stations are basic cable at best. The TV guide channel didn't work.
- ATM's in the lobby will cost you an additional $5.00 for surcharge fees. Be sure you need the cash.
- You can hear absolutely everything going on beside you, above you, and in the hallway. From people coughing to partying; you'll be a part of it all.
- Hair dryers are in bags in the closets.
- The linens all smell like they have been put in a dryer that had a fire in it at some point. Everything smells like burned hair.
- Drawers are not cleaned out for use. There are random items in there as well as dirt and dust.
- Rooms are extremely outdated. From the furniture to the carpet to the bathroom counters.


Ultimately, your money is better spent at Motel 8 or in a hostel than at the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino. If we return to Vegas, we will be happy to pay to stay at a hotel that deserves its four diamond rating.",4,0,2

The rooms are nice enough but I have been spoiled by the Trump on my first trip to Vegas so it's not really fair to compare the two. My entire experience at the Monte Carlo was a pleasant one, from check-in to check-out. The staff was really friendly and the concierge services were super helpful. 

Although I'm not a huge fan of casinos, mainly because of the smoke, it was kind of nice to have it there for entertainment. I also liked the convenience of the food court. Yes, there are much much better places to eat but when I'm craving a McChicken at 1 in the morning, I just want a McChicken! I probably ate more McDonald's in my short trip in Vegas that I did the entire last year. I'm not proud of it, but it happened!

The casino itself was ok. Don't bother expecting any sort of drink service though. I don't think I saw a single server the entire time I was there. Luckily, there is a bar at one end of the casino in case you really need a drink. 

I do wish that the hotel was more centrally located on the Strip. The tram that they have is kind of a joke; I feel like it doesn't really get you anywhere. I would stay here again if the price was right.",2,1,0

We had a great time at Minus 5, the Ice bar\/lounge where everything is made of ice from floor to ceiling. Made some good friends there and had lots of fun. Diablo's and The Pub are also great places to stop by, however, if you come for The Pub's happy hour, make sure you know exactly what it is and don't let the waiters pretend like it doesn't exist(read more about it in my review of the pub).

We usually stay at the Monaco Suite. It's a decent sized suite with a flat screen and living room area and 1.5 bathrooms(a full sized bathroom and one bathroom with just toilet and sink). The decor is nice and the couches are comfy. The monaco suite also comes with a fridge so its great for keeping your drinks cold rather than having to keep going to the ice machine.

The Monte Carlo is more of a no-frills type of establishment that is nice enough but not over the top luxurious or architecturally astounding as many of its neighbors.  That said we had a fantastic time here, and if it were not for our motto of  ""staying at a different place every time"" we would definitely return.

Let me start out with what I was impressed with:

-The staff was absolutely accommodating with our check in requests.  We were meeting friends that were flying in from Dallas and we had requested adjoining or near rooms.  We actually got adjoining rooms.  I know this may not seem like an enormous deal but it has been a hassle in times past at other facilities to even get close rooms so I was impressed with their accommodation.

-The addition of a Keurig coffee maker in the room is an absolute delight.  I'm already feeling the absence of that appliance at the Aria.  I'm a 'first thing in the morning"" coffee person and the idea of waiting for room service or heading downstairs to get a cup is dreadful.  I can't understand why LV can't just give us this as a standard

-The  location per price is prime.  It's very nice to save steps in Vegas but you take so many of them anyways and the closer to the middle of the strip, the further away you are from long treks back in the middle of the night.  Also, being on the tram stop is a huge additive as well.  A quick ride to the Bellagio puts you even closer.

Where it lacks:

-The casino was definitely not the high point of the facility.  The layout just seemed long and narrow and I'm a fan of larger ceilings.  The restaurants kind of just sit along the borders of the casino and their really isn't any intermingling of the two that I prefer.  

-It's definitely not a place you walk into to look around (a la Bellagio, Ceaser's, Aria, etc).  In fact  if your not staying here or seeing a show here then I can't imagine why you would really enter it.  That said, it's not really marketed that way and probably the reason that it is much cheaper which serves a market.

All in all, the Monte Carlo is a solid choice based on location and price point.  If your goal in Vegas is too spend your money on things other than your room, then the Monte Carlo allows you a cheaper starting off point to work from.   It's Vegas, so you should be constantly moving around anyways as there is so much to see and so many people to watch.",4,0,0

Easy walk to just about anywhere, accessible food for the late late night, good restaurants for the daytime meals, and quick to any place in the casino.  You won't be walking a mile just to get to your own hotel pool.

It's pretty easy to access any type of gambling you desire.  $5 blackjack if you look hard enough.  Bartenders come through the tables often and can make just about anything.  

The pool scene is great.  Wave pools, lazy river, dj setups, and no cover.  Not good for kids.  

The bummer from keeping it from five stars is that the Sports Book is pretty poor compared to other casinos, no club inside the casino, and wifi is poor.  Many didn't even think it existed.

Three stars because it is not the best, but most of the time you find some pretty reasonable deals, so you can't really complain.

I've read a couple reviews, where people got a deal on a room at the MC for 39 bucks, but then complain it is not as nice as the Bellagio. Check it, you paid 39 bucks, not $350, like a room at some of the higher end casinos. If I paid that amount for the MC then there would be a legit reason to complain.  

Which is why I said it's pretty damn good. Comfy bed, clean newer room, cozy atmosphere, and supreme location. Right smack in the middle of the strip. I've stayed here two times now, and had a pretty decent time both trips. Most of the time you are outside of your room, drinking, dancing, gambling, and just straight wondering around.

I called them and they said i smoked in my non-smoking room.  The only issue is that I DO NOT SMOKE. EVER. 

I spoke to the manager and he said I must have smoked since my room smelled like smoke.  This is impossible since I can't stand smoky rooms. My room smelled great and again I DO NOT SMOKE!

Ricky, the manager, could care less and said he had ""evidence.""  I asked him to email me the ""evidence"" and he said hotel policy does not allow this.

Finally, things worked out.

I've always liked the place.  d.Vino has some amazing food, I don't know if Brand still has the sorbet desserts, but you should really check those out if they're still there, the Pub is excellent, I always seem to do well enough at Pai Gow and slots, Diablos is always good for drinks, and the poker room is small but fun.  Now that the construction is done by the arena, access is also much easier.  

Taking full advantage of gold status, I handed the car to the valet and went to check in.  The line was getting long, but the VIP check in experience was incredibly easy and fast.  We were upgraded to a spa suite and on our way in about 10 minutes.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, which is a consistent theme throughout this hotel.  

The spa suites are next to the elevators, which is incredibly convenient.  The rooms themselves are definitely showing some signs of age, but that's why MGM is planning a full remodel of them in the next year. I have every reason to believe that it will be a top-of-the-line hotel when it's finished.  The rooms are still comfortable, clean, everything works like it should, but you can tell from looking at the furniture that it's time for a renovation to keep up with the competition.

Anyway, to sum up, I am headed back to the MC soon, and am looking forward to another good experience.  Like I said, all of the staff I interacted with were very professional and helpful, and the drink service on the casino floor was above average as well.  

Worth the 4 stars for the service and experience.  3 stars for the rooms, which are about to get the attention they need.  Overall, rounded up to 4 and am looking forward to staying here again.",2,0,0

I was actually married at the Monte Carlo in 2006, and had a huge suite. I'd only been back to visit friends who stayed there a couple of times over the years, and thought it was ok for the price point and of course the location is great.

So, when I checked in, I had relatively high hopes. I knew it wasn't going to be the Wynn, but I didn't expect a run down, old room, where the furniture was chipped, scuffed, and everything (except for the flat screen tv) looked just worn. It was seriously like staying in a Red Roof Inn. I was doubly disappointed because the check in agent went on and on about how great the room was and how he hooked me up. Uh, no. The room hasn't been updated since the Monte Carlo opened, I'm sure- and it showed.

I sat on the bed and just knew I'd be upset if I stayed in that room, given it was supposed to be a birthday ""staycation""- a gift to myself. I called the front desk to express my disappointment. The agent handled it well and offered to upgrade me to a junior suite for $30. Done.

The junior suite was MUCH nicer-  the decor was more modern, the room was huge- nice living room area, mini fridge (no microwave or mini bar, oddly), big bathroom, great view, and even a half bath at the entrance. My only real complaints with this room was that there were no outlets near the bed\/nightstands, and they provided very few towels. Otherwise, it was a good room and a huge improvement. 

So, the Monte Carlo saved their rating, but seriously, update those rooms. I know this isn't a 5 star property, but they should be a bit ashamed of themselves and the condition of the regular rooms.",13,4,3

It's not too bad on the price front. It's connected to the tram system. The room was a good a decent size; there were four of us in a 2 queen bed room. It didn't have an amazing view, but it was decent. The food court was standard; I appreciate that they had Subway as a choice rather than just things like McDonalds. There were other places to eat in the hotel, but I didn't get to try those out. 

There are a few bars as well, not a surprise there, but I did have my own personal favorite one, the Ignite Lounge. It was favorite because there were awesome bartenders that got to know me and always had awesome drinks. I would just say, ""Make me something strong and fruity,"" my standard order, and they would come back with something new and yummy. And they got to know me and my friend and would look out for us.

Half the casino was boarded up, the buffet closed the day after our arrival, and the construction was atrocious. We were on the 7th floor and were woken up to jack hammering at 9 am. Sounded like it was coming right through our bathroom walls. I didn't complain about it because I understand that this will happen with construction. Went to ask for late check out in the wee hours of the morning and was helped by Mary. She was very helpful and gave us our late check out for free. Also mentioned the construction, but not to be a complainer but just to say it out loud (I'm sure they receive quite a few complaints throughout the day), and she was kind enough to give us some free comps as well.

I don't understand why you can't even bring outside food or drinks into the pool area when they have their own food court in the hotel... I bought a drink and a banana from the Starbucks in the hotel and the pool girl told me no outside food or drinks.... so i brought my drink back to my room then came back down... i totally forgot i had my banana in my bag when i got down to the pool, so she searched my bag and then the same pool girl rudely said, you can't bring that banana in there, so i went to the side and ate it... 

 finally i was in the pool area getting a towel and i asked for 2 and a different pool girl said 1 towel per person while the person before me just asked for 4 towels and she gave them to him... it's like be consistent... if you're going to give 1 towel per person then just do that, don't give 1 guest 4 towels and another 1 towel.

they expect you to buy food and drinks poolside, but you can't even get service... my friends and i waited about an hour for the waitress to come to us... my friend had to ask her twice and he also asked if there was another place we could order from and of course there wasn't... so we got tired of waiting almost 2 hours without service that we just packed up and left the pool area...

another incident i had in the pool area was another guest and his daughter were coming in as i was leaving and the same pool girl at the entrance told them they couldn't being a stinking bottled of water into the pool area... it's like what the heck, it's just a bottled water?!?!?!

all in all, if you're gonna stay at the Monte Carlo for the pool area... don't do it, it's not worth it... i don't think I'd stay here again because the reason why i go to Vegas is for the pool, the nightlife, and the gambling and since the pool area sucks then this hotel is out of the question....",0,0,0

The cons:
- terrible location and a far walk from most things on the strip 
- the whole place stinks of cigarettes masked with a vanilla scent 
- crappy pool area that does not compare to the pools in the other hotels 
- poor water pressure, water not hot enough 
- crappy toiletries 

The one pro and only saving grace:
- it's connected to the free tram that runs through Aria and Bellagio, (and a short walk to Caesar's Palace from Bellagio) 

If I were to go back to Vegas, I would stay in one of the other newer hotels.  Both Bellagio and Caesar's Palace has really nice pools.

Update: I got someone to fix the water pressure, so that was good. I extended my stay by an extra day and paid $82.

We waited another thirty minutes to get our key fixed on day three, since apparently their 1984 commodore vic-20 computer system can't handle something as ridiculously complicated as a comp'd room.  Silly us.  

The lobby was not full of vultures accosting people and trying to give away ""free shows"" - presumably because they'd be beaten to death by management for being too helpful, so that was nice.  The convenience store sells 20 oz bottles of soda for $4.50 and bottled starbucks beverages for more than it costs to take a cab to Seattle and buy one there.  I can only surmise that the inflated price is to offset the cost of not refrigerating the beverages - Ive literally produced colder urine.

The casino is fairly nice and the machines all work, but the cocktail waitresses evidently have the same break schedule as the staff at the checkin counter.  In order to get a free drink in that casino, you basically need to get up on the roulette table and start taking your clothes off while dancing to Usher and Pitbull songs.

It's not a particularly bad hotel. But it's not particularly great one either. Overall, we're left with three impressions: 
1) the accountants are in control
2) the place is losing money
3) maybe we should have spent a little more to get a little more. 

Most of the staff (check-in, check-out, valet, maids, bell service) was terrific. On the other hand, there was no cocktail service at the gaming tables in the wee hours of the morning. 

We tried both the buffet and the café, both had good food and mediocre service. 

The Lobby Starbucks came in handy: though we had a suite, there was no coffee maker in the room, nor was it possible to get one from housekeeping. 

Other stuff that should have been included:  
* gym $19\/day
* Internet $14.99\/day. 

We'd originally selected the Monte Carlo because it has a 400 foot long ""Lazy River."" 400 feet sounds like a pretty long river, until you realize that with over 3000 rooms, the hotel hosts over 6000 guests.  Do the math: that's more than 15 guests per foot of river. The rest of the pool's facilities are similarly undersized. 

The result is that for the limited hours the pool area is open (9a-7p), the pool's facilities are too crowded for comfort. We bumped and got bumped enough by other people in the river that we left after an hour or two, never returning throughout our five-day stay. 

The hotel, like many large businesses, handles most things with highly optimized efficiency. And by things, I mean ""guests."" 

We don't wanna be ""things."" We wanna be valued guests staying in a premier hotel on the world-famous Las Vegas strip, even if part of why we chose the hotel was its affordability. 

I had a hard time putting my finger on why the stay at the hotel was so unremarkable, but a book I recently read (The Designful Company, by Marty Neumeier) raises an interesting theory (see: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/m4qgro).

In it, the author suggests that businesses cannot continue to make themselves more efficient and profitable if they are to succeed and grow. Instead, they need to find authentic ways to connect with target audiences. 

The best and most memorable parts of our vacation took place outside the hotel. 

Why would we return?

Friends of ours showed up a few hours later and stood in line for over an hour to check in because there was only ONE person checking people in. Not acceptable. And when we finally checked in, we were told there were no more king beds available until the following day. Fine, whatever. Except our friends who checked in later that night got a king bed! 

Cleanliness\/Comfort: The rooms are old, outdated, and dingy. The old carpets were covered in stains. The beds were low and lumpy (although the pillows were soft). There was hair on the bathroom floor that clearly didn't belong to us. We also found a couple of bugs in our room.

One of the best parts of this hotel is the pool area. Various pools, spas, and a lazy river! Plus, you don't have to wait ridiculous lines or have a promoter get you in. It's a low key yet still a fun pool... perfect to spend a hot Vegas day.

The main amenity I like is the food court.  In vegas, if you are not careful, you can quickly overspend on your budget.  Having a food court with cheap food options for breakfast or lunch is very nice to keep the trip within budget.

The pools are also nice - but different.  There is a lazy river and a wave pool.  The river is very nice to relax and float around in.

Clean rooms, friendly staff, awesome pool area, centrally located, low price. What's not to like? 

I've stayed here both times I went to Vegas and was not disappointed. On my most recent visit I was able to check in and go to my room at 11:30AM. 

While the rooms are nice and clean, there is some noticeable wear and tear on the fixtures in the bathroom. Other than that I have no complaints about the room. 

There are plenty of options for meals and entertainment in all different price ranges. From the food court to a steakhouse and everything in between (even a cupcake shop!). 

The gym and spa are really nice. My friends and I got our money's worth of the resort fee ($12.95 per room per day) by using the gym 4 days on our visit and maybe taking more than our share of the complimentary water bottles (a bottle in the gift shop will set you back $3!). Use of the gym is included in the resort fee, but if you want to use the sauna\/steam room\/indoor jacuzzi it is $5 per day per person. Since we were running the Rock n Roll Las Vegas Half Marathon during our stay we decided to splurge on this stuff the day of the race and it was the perfect way to relax afterwards.

Pool area is awesome and even though on my most recent visit it was a bit chilly for it (50's-60's), my friends and I still went down one day and took advantage of the hot tub with intermittent dips in the regular pool. Sadly (although understandably because it was too cold for it) the wave pool and lazy river were closed.

The best thing about this hotel is the price and location.

The bedding seemed old, the blanket was scratchy, and I felt like the itchy blanket and bedspread had hidden herpes on it. Maybe it was just my imagination because I hate those hotel blankets. Much would have preferred those lovely duvets that some hotels have.

The bath products that were left for us looked like they had promise, but left my hair limp and difficult to comb out. The conditioner clearly did not condition. Yes, those little things make a difference for me.

Real shocker was how expensive the food court is - Starbucks was at least a dollar more than in Chicago, and I guess their Subway never heard that $5 footlooong song - the least expensive sub was a $6 - for a 6 inch!

The $10 resort fee pissed me off, even though I expected it from when I booked, because all you got was basically 2 small bottles of water and free local calls. Um, ok.

The casino wasn't too smoky, and had a few fun games, although the service was a bit lacking - you had to practically pounce on a waitress to get you a drink. We particularly liked the video blackjack games that you could bet 25 cents a hand. What - we're not big gamblers!

Good:
-The location was great, right by city center, and close enough to walk to Caesars and all of the other big hotels.
-The food court. I spent so much time here trying to sober up. I love the options, even though I ate about 4 subway sandwiches.
-The pool area was soooo much fun!!! The lazy river and wave pool were always packed with drunk people. They had a lot of contests going on and djs playing and I won a dance contest doing the robot! Not great for children though.
-The rooms were pretty spacious, definitely enough room for the extra people that always end up sleeping on the floor. 

Okay, the bad:
-Our keys NEVER worked. When we checked in we got 3 keys, when we stumbled back to the room at night none of them worked. We even had to ask a security guard for help, and he couldn't open the room. We went down to the front desk and they apologized and gave us new keys and a $50 comp, but we went to the front desk about 2 more times to get new keys because the ones we had still didn't work. 
-The elevators took forever! And when you finally got on one, you ended up stopping at every floor. I think I rode down to the lobby with 10+ people each time.
-The room was broken...kinda. The first time I took a shower the tub wouldn't drain, so I was standing almost knee-deep in water. They sent up a plumber to look at it, but it was still gross. Also, when someone put a towel on the towel rack, it broke right off the wall. We called the front desk to tell them about it and make sure the room wasn't charged for it. 
-When we originally checked in, they said we didn't need a card to put on file for incidentals. I provided one, but they said it wouldn't be charged. I have never been to a hotel that didn't hold a deposit, so I thought it was weird. When we checked out, I was informed that $300 was charged to my card. The room wasn't even that much money. The guy at the front desk didn't have any idea why the card was charged, and we had to wait for a long time while he asked around and took it off.

The room itself isn't very welcoming but for the price we paid, we didn't mind. We didn't have any noise complaints, the bed was ok in comfort and the water in the shower was hot and steamy. I did not like though that the reception in our room was terrible! I later found out that there is only wifi in the first two floors, boooo!!! Better reception would make this place a lot better.

the blankets might have been nice and soft, but the pillows were way too high for me. felt like i was sleeping on 3 pillows. on the last night i notice there was a stain on my blanket, had no idea what it was. my mom said it was lipstick, but i'm pretty sure it wasn't. the towels had this weird smell to it... and one of towels was still dirty. and the water pressure is ridiculous! i thought i was being sprayed by a firefighter hose. even though they came in everyday to clean the room there was always hair left on the bathroom floor.

We stayed here and were given an upgraded room in one of their newly renovated floors.  Whoa, interesting upgrades!

The bathroom is spacious.  No longer beige and ugly with their out-dated shower\/tubs and towels smelling of burnt popcorn, now they have a large roomy shower with red tiling.  The sinks are modern but I didn't like them.  The water pooled and cleaning them must suck for housekeeping.  The beds were soft but pretty low on the ground.  There's no conventional desk for your laptop but a long couch by the window with a standing table serves to remedy this problem.  Other than that, those are all your major furniture bits.  The WiFi is TERRIBLE! In this day and age, that's unacceptable.  I was pretty much using data in my room.  Um, no, I don't want that.  Give your guest a password safe network like all the other hotels.

There are no dining options besides their food court in the hotel at the moment due to construction but they're a short walk from The Park and is still accessible to Aria.  These new renovations have potential though.  I can't wait to see how this place ends up looking now that the T-Mobile Arena is next door and they house the Park Theater.

They have some low table minimums so that's always a plus if you don't want to break the bank. Cocktail waitresses are always walking around.

The public areas of the hotel-casino are quite nice as is the spa\/exercise room. There is a variety of decent dinning options, including a food court that has a McDonald's, Subway, a fresh Mex and pizza place. 
I stayed on a non-smoking floor (23), which was quiet. The room itself was in need of updating. The carpet was clean but worn and the furniture was both beat up and dated (the drawn on the desk kept sliding open for no reason and I finally had to wedge a piece of paper in it to keep it shut. 
The bed and pillows were comfortable and the bedding was adequate but nothing fancy. The bath was adequate with tile floor and a good shower (though some might find the flow pressure a bit high). 
Overall, the room reminded me of a basic Comfort Inn or Best Western.

The Monte Carlo has the audacity to charge a resort fee as they have nothing that resembles a resort. They do not have a spa, a pool or any food.  Plus they only have a 1\/3 of a casino open and an inadequate number of front desk staff to manage the guest check in and phones...The hotel is obviously under renovation. One would think they need to explain to a potential guest before they book the resort there will be absolutely nothing on the property that resembles a resort.  

How can you charge a resort fee and feel like you are not cheating the guests? Unbelievable, really!  

First, this resort is a real honest to goodness FOOD DESERT!  When I called downstairs to inquire about food I was greeted with an answer of, ""we just don't have anything right now but you could go to another property for food!"" Are you kidding me I am not able to eat at the resort I am staying at, really?  Seems like a relatively minor request consider this is Las Vegas and all...this resort is not the Travel Lodge.  I realize as I was wasting away from food deprivation that this would be the best place for someone post bariatric surgery...zero temptations.  I do not think that is the demographic you are marketing to or it was not clear when I booked.  

Second, on the first full day I was here I returned to my room after a full day away to a pair of men's shoes and socks in my room.  I called downstairs to inquire who was in my room and was greeted with a response of, ""it probably was the housekeeping staff who left the shoes and socks there because they could have been found in another room and the cart was full.""  Really that is your answer?  They were tucked nicely at the end of the platform bed in plain sight.  Riddle me this, why would the housekeeping staff bring shoes and socks into my room and neatly place the at the foot of my bed? This does not even seem plausible, right?  The front desk manager said they would check the door entrance swipes to see who entered the room.  So they called me back to tell me that only housekeeping entered my room...when asked they were unwilling to share the proof, so who really knows...

And the trifecta...Here is the absolute worst inexcusable thing about the entire stay the staff are rude at best!  Unapologetic, arrogant, non-customer centric savages, at least the ones that I encountered from check in to check out!  One would think they would be apologizing or at least sympathizing with with the guests but nope, quite to the contrary!  

Shame on you MGM Resorts...I thought better of you!!!  You have so much work to do to convert this property from a -1 Star resort to a 5 Star resort that you are attempting to become!  Changing a name will not change the customer service and customer experience!  

I welcome you to contact me because I will be happy to share names with you if you are interested  in learning from the abysmal visit.

I've stayed at the Rio, Treasure Island (first guest in a refurbished room a few years ago) and honestly, I love Monte Carlo. First and foremost, when it comes to social media, Monte Carlo is all over it. They're quick to respond to questions on Twitter, and are super helpful with recommendations. The staff at the resort itself is the same. We went to Vegas to do pool time and boozing. So our gambling consisted of $20 at the video poker machines at Ignite Bar (by Minus 5) and that included all we could drink. Bet 25 cents a hand, and you can really get your money's worth. And I won! Who actually wins on video poker? 

The pool is awesome. Lazy river, wave pool, huge hot tub and a regular pool give you plenty of options. We were there April 14-17 and we were never crowded when we were outside. 

Breakfast buffet is affordable and $4 extra gets you unlimited Mimosas. Seriously? Yes. And there are crab legs on the breakfast buffet. Amazing. 

Rooms were clean, had what we needed (because seriously, who spends a lot of time in their room in Vegas?), and when we needed more towels or whatever, they were quick to send those up. 

The Pub... Diablos... The watering holes at the Monte Carlo do not disappoint. Loved the chili garlic wings and sliders (AND HELLO BEER SELECTION) at the Pub, and Diablos is an awesome venue for some night time cocktails.

Room:
The rooms are usually clean, but outdated.  There can be some cleanliness issues as others have mentioned but for the most part I did not ever feel disgusted.  My only complaint would be the restroom, specifically the shower.  The water pressure is terrible and the temperature does not get boiling hot as I like.  This is a big drawback for me as I enjoy taking several showers a day after dealing with the dessert heat, and I like my showers hot!  So if these are your pet peeves, hope you get lucky with a decent shower.

Location:
Definitely a positive, and one of the reasons I would choose to stay at the Monte Carlo over some of your other cheaper options.  There is a free tram that connects you to the Aria\/City Center and Bellagio.  We used the tram to get us to the Bellagio and took a short walk through the resort to connect to Caesar's and also to Planet Hollywood across the street.  Trams take no more than 15 minutes to arrive.  You can also walk into the Aria directly through the same walkway that takes you to the tram.  

Pool:
The pool is also definitely a positive, and would be a factor in why I would choose to stay here.  There are 3 pools, a regular pool, a small lazy river, and a wave pool as well as a beach volleyball court!  The pool area itself is small and can be difficult to find a few chairs, usually we were able to find some next to the volleyball courts.  You can check out a volleyball from the desk with an I.D., however pay attention to the ball as we were constantly hitting it over the wall into the street, and had to go chase it down using the exit doors.  The surrounding buildings also tend to fill the pool area with shade earlier than other resorts which can be a good or bad thing.  There is also a Dj that plays music on top of the wave pool which can be heard throughout the area, definitely more catered to the party scene than the relaxing scene but wasn't a problem as I was still able to nap comfortably.  

Food:
Recently remodeled front entrance and added a 800 Degree Pizza which was not bad but not comparable to Blaze Pizza in Souther California IMO, which I felt they were trying to contend with, a good ice cream place BLVD Creamery, as well as a few other places I have not tried.  Brand Steakhouse is really good though!  Would definitely recommend this steakhouse, great place for a large party as you can share a 120 oz steak for $250.  It's supposed to be shared by 6 people but we were able to share it amongst 8 of us (6 guys and 2 girls) and it was filling.  The sweet creamed corn is also highly recommended.  Lastly there is a food court with your usual McDonald's running 24 hours, Subway 24 hours, and Sbarro which was almost 24 hours.  The line for McDonald's late night did get really long so prepare to wait.

Overall I would recommend staying at the Monte Carlo if you are with a group of friends looking for a place to stay with a good pool, good cheap food options, and good location.  If you are staying with your significant other and looking for a little bit nicer place, I'd say it would be a hit or miss depending on the room you get.  I would definitely stay here again depending on the price and would recommend it to others as well.",1,0,0

I usually drive here, so it's not lack of transportation. I don't know anyone that hooks me up on rates, so there aren't any deals. I guess that it was once a ritual with my friends when we didn't have a lot of money, and I just got comfortable.

I know all the bars and restaurants, which some are good and bad. The buffet is meh, along with the rooms. Elevators feel like your going to blast off into outer space, but I guess they have to with that many floors. Pool is okay, nothing crazy. It does have a Rubio's,
 which I generally stumble on over to at four in the morning to order a shrimp burrito, and try not to get it all over my shirt.

Instead its just like every other casino and hotel on the strip. With the new CityCenter complex right next door, with all its sheen and glamor, this place sits in its shadow.

Nonetheless, it is still a decent hotel to stay at, with all your desired amenities of a 4-star hotel. The casino staff are mild-mannered with nothing special.

We chose the Monte Carlo because we thought they would enjoy the pool area, and they really did.  If it weren't for the pools, we might have changed hotels. It wasn't awful, but we really wanted everything to be perfect for this trip. We travel a lot for business and are used to overlooking a lot. There are a lot of minor irritations with this stay that will lead us to stay elsewhere next time. 

The check in process took a half hour to get one of our three rooms. It was early, so we were okay that all the rooms weren't ready but taking that long when we wanted to get to the pool was a bummer. We were told that our reservation is only a request for a certain room type and they wouldn't guarantee an adjoining room for the guys or a king room for my husband and I. When we finally got our room, we were told it was a king but we got there and it wasn't. We ended up getting a king but had to give up the strip view we reserved. Not a big deal, but pretty disorganized. 

The rooms are okay - nice linens and the decor is fine but the bathrooms are pretty dated. The Internet is only available via a cable so no Internet for devices other than a laptop.  The room seemed clean but there was a towel in our bathroom with urine on it that I almost used on my hair. Thank god it fell on the floor with the pee side up or I wouldnt have noticed it.  I let the front desk know so they could let their staff know to watch for stuff like that. They apologized and ordered a full cleaning for our room.  For some reason half the lampshades in the rooms I was in looked like someone sat on them. Kinda weird. 

All in all the Monte Carlo is pretty decent but I will try a different place next time. I wanted to treat everyone to the Blue Man Group but the best discount the hotel offers still leaves tickets over $100 per person - pretty hefty for our group of seven.

I wanted to love you, I did. I read up on your website and I was interested in your centered strip location and your gorgeous pools, and you know what? THEY WERE! 

I never stay at the same hotel twice in Vegas, I decided to give you a try...

My fiance and I are so disappointed in your lack of customer service. There was a situation in YOUR food court area where a food court employee that goes by the name of NANCY RODRIGUEZ decided to have a personal dispute in the hotel and throw food at her boyfriend, which happened to land ALL OVER my fiance's SILK TOP. It was ketchup, and ketchup STAINS.

After speaking to the front desk about the appalling situation and making a complaint we were told that  ""the food court has nothing to do with our hotel, you were at the wrong place at the wrong time"". No offers to clean the shirt, no apologies. We came here as a group of 20 whom paid for 6 seperate rooms and have brought plenty of business here and this is how it was handled!

We went back to the McDonalds Nancy Rodriguez worked for and complained to the manager about his employee's behavior at the hotel and how she has thrown food all over a PAYING GUEST! He then asked us "" What do you want me to do about it?"". You're the manager! You tell me what you are going to do!!!

In any case, with our luck Nancy Rodriguez decided to further her public dispute at the food court, which now consisted of 5 other people looking for a fight. I approached her angrily and told her ""Excuse me, when you decided to have food thrown at your boyfriend you covered my fiance with ketchup as well!"" She shrugged it off and stated ""(Sigh) Sorry"" and went back to her fight!

The Manager all the while just watched this without interfering! There was no HOTEL SECURITY breaking up this fight! An employee from HAAGEN DAS had to leave their booth and break it up!

Sorry, when I come to Vegas I like to have a little class and expect excellent customer service. This place just earned itself a terrible review. We are running back to you, Steve Wynn! Take all our money, we don't care! We want Monte Carlo burned down!",2,3,0

It's a little mundane and less lively than some of the other themed hotels\/resorts and new swanky ones on the strip, but when staying on a budget in Vegas and looking to stay on the strip in a large hotel, the Monte Carlo is a great choice.

It's affordable and has the basic amenities like a spa, a show (Lance Burton), a pool with a wave pool and lazy river (I stayed here first when I was a kid, it was great!), a diverse selection of in-house restaurants (French, Italian, Chinese, Mexican, Steakhouse, brewery with American food, etc) and fast food joints (McDonald's, Subway, Sbarro, Rubio's, Starbucks, etc) so you can eat within any price range, however there is practically no shopping, only a little, sad, pathetic, fake cobblestone ""boulevard"" by the brewery where several stores used to be. There once was a wine shop, a jewelry store and a handful of others, but now only a clothing store geared towards mid-aged women and a sunglasses store now remains.

I would like to comment on the AMAZING water pressure in the showers. Seriously, it was better than any hotel I can vividly remember. You know it's something when you walk away from the trip and that's what you remember of your hotel room. Otherwise, the room was decent, but nothing extraordinary.

I was a late check in and called the hotel earlier in the day around noon to inform them that I would be checking in around 11PM. As expected, I arrived on the property around 10:30pm and saw that there was a HUGE line for check in. had to wait in line for about 45 minutes until I finally saw a front desk agent.

The agent told me that the strip view room I had booked was no longer available, whatever that means. I told the agent that I had fully paid for a strip view room and anything else was unacceptable. In short, the agent told me there was NOTHING he could do except put me up in a non-strip view room, then give me a call the next day around 3PM so I could move to a strip view room.

My temporary room was small, bland, utterly boring with a view of the 15 freeway. I waited until 4PM the next day and was not given a call on my room line, nor my cell, as promised by the agent from the night before. I ended up having to call the front desk and after being transferred to 4 different people, I was finally given a room to transfer to with a strip view. I asked that the difference in price from the night before be refunded to me, or comped in some sort of way. My request was denied.

Overall, had a horrifying time at this hotel. I was straight up robbed of money for a specific room I paid for fully in advance. If you're not going to give me the type of room I reserve, why even have reservations? Never returning to this dirty hotel ever again, not even to gamble, drink, or eat at any of its restaurants.",6,0,2

We wore our shoes while walking on it because we had no idea what germs & bacteria were living in it. Filthy, worn out & stained. Time to upgrade the carpeting.  Our friends stayed in regular rooms & had similar issues. 

The sink in the wet bar was clogged the whole week we were here. We had to go buy a bar of soap for the shower & bathroom sink because none were ever left for us from housekeeping.  There were no lights in the ""living room area"" so reading or relaxing in that area was impossible. The light for the shower was burned out & despite several requests to fix it, we went without the whole week we were here. 

The curtains covering the one window in the suite were too small to fit the window & the lights from the strip (MGM's lights mostly) were annoying to us, we're light sensitive.  Is it too much to hope your curtain fits your window appropriately to do its job blocking out lights?

Parents more interested in things beside their children would let their children use the hallways as their playground. Ice fights, yelling, screaming, running thru the hallways, banging on doors & walls...  2 calls to the front desk to complain yielded no help & the shenanigans lasted until after 4am.  

To reach the strip, you're required to go all the way thru the casino. Careful not to get run into by the out-of-control children who are overstimulated from all the flashing lights, bells & whistles. Or the drunk parents pushing strollers around into your ankles & over your toes...  Nevada law states no one under the age of 21 on the casino floor. Monte Carlo ignores that law. 

I come to Vegas a lot & would be hard pressed to stay here again. You get what you pay for & if you're looking for a cheap, ratty room with hit & miss service, the Monte Carlo is the place for you. As for me, I'll stick to the places I love despite whatever ""great deal package"" places like the Monte Carlo offer online.",2,1,0

Convenient - The Monte Carlo was very convenient for us since it had a tram connecting it to the Aria\/Crystals and the Bellagio. Made it nice to avoid the heat. Also, it's entrance from the Strip is closer to the street than some casinos, which was nice when trying to avoid the heat.

Casino - Our preferred game is video poker, and then have several price points available - from $0.05 to $5. Some also had USB chargers for your phone, which was a very nice perk.

Restaurants\/Food - I liked that they had fast food up through nice dining, so you could have a variety of options nearby. 

Smoke - Though all casinos in Vegas have some smoking, it didn't feel smokey unless someone was actively smoking nearby. 

Restrooms - The restrooms felt very clean, in part because there seemed to be workers diligently cleaning it at regular intervals. (This was very much appreciated.)

My only complaint is that the signs could be a little more clear throughout, since occasionally you would start walking one way (as directed), but then the desired place wouldn't be included on the next sign. People were very kind to help if turned around, but other casinos do seem to be a little better at this piece.",2,1,1

After writing the below review and taking the customer satisfaction survey sent out by the hotel after I returned home, I was contacted by the hotel via e-mail.  They genuinely addressed all of my concerns and I am 100% satisfied with their response to these issues below and another that I mentioned in the e-mail.  As a result, I added a star to the review and plan to return. 

==================================================

I usually wait until a stay is complete before Yelping but in this case the atrocity that they call their internet service has driven me mad enough to write mid-stay.  Yes, even Vegas, some people like to be moderately productive during the day.

This was my first time in this hotel and my first time in Las Vegas.

I'll start with the somewhat positive.  The price is decent for the location in just about the heart of the strip.  My room was clean, the housekeeping staff were excellent and the check in woman did a nice job of getting me an early room since I happened to fly in early.  I am not typically picky with  hotels because for me they are usually nothing more than a place to sleep and when on vacation, I am usually outside.  But I do need a functional internet.

The Negative - It's bad enough they charge the so-called ""resort fee"" (I do realize that is par for the course out here) but to charge it for a service that barely works is unconscionable.  The only access to the internet in the rooms in this hotel is through an Ethernet cable; yes, in 2015, just an Ethernet cable (anyone know if there is a port for that on an iPad?  That is just absurd.  They do of course claim that the resort fee covers coffee, a newspaper, use of a printer for boarding passes (in 2015?, smart phone anyone?) - all things I can get for free at a 29.99 per night rest stop motel.  

Anyway, I digressed,  back to the Ethernet cable connection.  I did happen to bring my laptop for some strange reason, something I barely ever use to begin with.  When I realized this hotel had no WiFi in the rooms  (yes, no WiFi in the rooms in 2015) I was at least relieved to plug in the Ethernet cable into my laptop.  Let's just say in 1997 if I was using AOL and dial-up my speed would  have been faster.  It was slow to the point where it was just plain useless.

Due to the historic blizzard that blanketed the northeast my flight was cancelled and I was forced to stay an extra two nights (it's Vegas, I don't mind being stuck here!). However, when adding the extra two nights on to the stay, and explaining the extenuating circumstances and showing the CNN headline which quoted the weather service as calling the storm life threatening, I thought I might get a little break on the price for the extra two nights - nope. 

As for the restaurants  in the hotel (Brand and The Pub), I will Yelp them separately but they will be positive reviews.

Conclusion - If you want a reasonably priced hotel in the center of the action with a decent steak house and have no plans to use the internet, then this place would work.  If you're like me and like to occasionally check your e-mail and do even a little work when you are away, don't bother.",4,2,0

We contemplated booking our rooms at a ""lesser quality"" casino, but I opened my big mouth and said ""Hey! Let's spend a few extra bucks and stay at a really nice place instead! Monte Carlo is only a little more per night and it will be so much better."" So that January evening I decided to pick up the telephone and call the Monte Carlo so I could speak to a human. The gentleman on the line took my info, confirmed my reservation and charged my card almost $200.00. Great. I'm done with that part. (I assumed). Well, flash forward to check-in. The front desk has my reservation and $177, but will be needing more money for the ""resort fees and taxes, and what have you."" Uh, cool but I already paid all that. ""Yes ma'am, through a third party, and they don't include the fees and what have you's."" ....Huh?? ""I called you guys. YOU guys. As in the Monte Carlo.""
Well, buyer beware: if you actually call to reserve a room, make sure you are actually talking to a person that is physically AT the casino. Confirm what they plan on charging you so you don't have any confusion at the front desk for 45 minutes upon checking in.
Well, once you do get to that 'delux' room, don't expect greatness. You'll be greeted with peeling wall paper, dirty walls, moldy caulking in the showers, a make-up mirror that is three feet off the floor. Oh, did I mention the construction that is occurring outside that sounds like a constant alarm clock going off starting circa 6:30 AM? Or the paper thin walls? And can't say I've ever had to bring my own soap into a hotel. Until now. Thank goodness the husband had some handy. The one little disc they provided for the two days we stayed was inadequate. 
On the brighter side, my sis and her husband won a few hundred on the slots downstairs, so maybe a good place for slots, but not for sleeping.",1,2,0

We immediately noticed that our room was cleaned or attempted to be cleaned prior to our arrvial. Some towels were dirty, pillow case had lipstick stains, hair in the sink, small bits of trash on the floor and all the lamp shades were broken! I couldn't help but smile and shake my head  while staring at the hand prints on the ceiling over the bed! After waiting on hold for 13 minutes (no joke), the front desk finally transferred my call to Housekeeping (another long wait). Finally, our lamp shades were replaced and clean linen and towels were replenished. The room staff is very nice and helpful. I think this hotel is about 10 years old and maintenance seems neglected. Too bad. Loved the pool (heated) which was perfect for this time of year. Other places just close the pool for the season.  Perfect for pre and post race warm up and recovery. Lifeguards were cool!  The casino was nice and great idea on the food court.

I lived in Vegas for a time and Even though I was back in Vegas for purely wonder, shopping, and family, I've been all over the strip. I've never stayed at a strip hotel resort and casino. I was skeptical but happy to say I was very pleasantly surprised!

Now in my opinion only and this being my first time staying at a casino but I loved my stay at the Monte Carlo. The shops, the restaurant, the atmosphere was truly Vegas. Each hotel\/ casino is their own distinct finger print but some creative and architecture similarities are present. I'm going to say this in the best way possible: the Monte Carlo is the cheaper Bellagio and that's not a bad thing. 

What lead me to the Carlo was the look and location. It's located right in the middle of everything and it's fantastic, specially if you don't have a car or rent one. Go to your right or left and adventures abound. Now as far as the rooms go, I stayed in the ""High Floor Deluxe"" room. I had a little bit of view of the strip but not much and they charge and each $20 or so for a room with a view of the strip, beware budget hounds! 

My negative is the resort fee of $28 a day. What's included in the resort fee you ask, well you get access to the pool, gym and Business center. ALL of which I did not use but still had to pay- just in case... No. You get 4 stars Carlo not 5.

The gambling is pretty basic. 

I did not like that you had to walk through the entire casino to get to the front doors from the elevators... one its a long walk as if you didn't have a ton of walking to do out on the strip already. 

The coupons are a rip off -- at least with the Ignite bar.  We were given a coupon for drinks after buying tickets to the Blue Man Group.  2 for 1.

Given I enjoy the country life more than the city life I can honestly say the Monte Carlo made my first time in Vegas a vacation I will never forget. The hotel room was on the 31st floor and overlooked the back side of NY NY. Not an awesome veiw but lets be honest, who goes to Vegas to stare out their window? Our bed was compfy and bathroom was clean. Our room didn't have the problems that other yelpers have posted on here. 

The casino was fun. But it helps when the people you play the tables with are just as entertaining as your dealer is. The three times we played blackjack at the MC we had friendly, engaging and fun dealers and players. Which made playing a game I was not used to playing a lot more fun than I thought it would be. The slot machines where fun. We got hooked on the ""Hangover"" slot machine for the most part. I really enjoyed playing the bonus rounds. 

As far as food goes, the Cafe was worth the money paid for breakfast. They give you a lot of food for your money. The Dragon Noodle wasn't my favorite. Our food was bland and dry. I was sadly disapointed with it. The Chinese Food in my very small town was better than the Dragon Noodle. 

The Blueman Group color parade at 6:15 every night was fun to watch. 

Never got to the pool but it looked nice.

The tram from our hotel to the Aria and Bilaggio was very nice. Made it easy to get around.

Really, for the price, it was very nice. I stayed with my boyfriend for 2 nights for $226 (room + tax) + $40 (resort fee of $20\/nt). (ps - I booked thru Hotels.com) Specifically, we booked this hotel bc 1) it was the cheapest but nicest hotel on the strip right next to the City Center with a casino and 2) no parking fees since we drove and the other hotels had the resort fee (which is standard for most hotels in Vegas) PLUS a parking fee of anywhere from $15-30\/night which is just ridiculous. I have no regrets of booking my room here. For the price, I wasn't expecting a luxurious room but a decent and clean room which is exactly what it was. We got there around 1PM and we were able to check-in early which was a huge plus since we just got there after a 8 hour drive.

Also, we won the most money here outta all the casino's we went to! SCORE! We were able to come back home WITH some money still in our wallets which was SOOOO unexpected, thanks to Monte Carlo! 

As for food options, they had a food court which had the standard food court joints such as Starbucks, McDonalds, Sbarro's, Subway, etc. Most of which were open 24 hours which was perfect for those late nights! Also, look for my review on one of their restaurants, Brand Steakhouse (I gave 3 stars.. Go find out why!!). They also had a froyo place, crepe place, and a candy store which was all a lot of fun.

Checking in was smooth and fast - no line and less than 5 minutes to get the keys.  The resort fee, resort tax, and room tax wasn't exactly a fun surprise since I wasn't using the resort features.  It wasn't a negative star for the hotel but an annoyance.  One major letdown was that they wouldn't let me upgrade to a king bed room because they were all booked out.. On a Monday? Of a non-holiday week??  Bamboozled since I wanted to pay for the upgrade.  

The room wasn't ready upon check in.  The smell of the cleaning agent was so strong that it made us gag.  The room was basic, clean, and reasonable for the price.  The decor is outdated though.  No main light in the room so you have to turn on all five lamps in the room.  The blow dryer was pretty sad, from the 90s?  Nice flashback.  The service that made me dislike Monte Carlo was that it seemed disorganized.  The housekeeping staff woke us up at 830 then 930 by trying to get into our room.  It was like they didn't know this room was booked?? That makes no sense and was really annoying after a long night.  Other than that, it was okay as we didn't stay in the room for the most part.  

The hotel had lots of shops and a food court open 24\/7 for convenience so that was nice.    

The review ends here because that's all the hotel had to offer me.  It felt like the hotel just existed.  It didn't feature any great attractions or must sees, but it wasn't exceptionally horrible (aside from housekeeping).

This was my second time staying at here, the first time was back in 2006.  It's not a new or desired hotel in comparison to some of the newer ones nearby, but it does the job for a few days in Sin City.  Location is decent and the free tram which takes you up to the Bellagio was a bonus in getting to the middle of the strip quickly and cheaply.

Rooms were average, our room was a bit more dated than the others in our party who were on a higher floor.  I also wish the bathrooms had double sinks and ceiling exhaust fans.  A few in our group were VIPs (hence the reason we stayed here), so I did see one of the one bedroom suites with a living room, wet bar, and jacuzzi tub, which was really nice.  Staff were pleasant enough during the few interactions I had with them.

The wifi is really spotty, I gave up after a day or two of trying to use it, but luckily I have an unlimited data plan on my phone so it didn't matter too much.  

The pool was fun and consists of a wave pool, regular pool, hot tub and lazy river.  The food and drinks are completely overpriced, but, welcome to Vegas.  On weekends there is a DJ and some poolside entertainment and its a bit rowdy, however there are some quiet areas to lounge if that's not your thing.  Sundays and weekdays are very quiet and there is music playing but no DJ.

Now, it's not the Bellagio- but it's definitely not the Circus Circus. You can get a good Vegas experience in the heart of the strip without breaking the bank. I also like that it's walking distance from the other hotels, so hopping from place to place isn't an issue.

The rooms are clean, but again, no-frills. For us, we don't spend too much time in the room, we usually wander around, shop, gamble and eat. We're not the club type, so having one in the hotel is definitely not a priority.

The casino has the usual slots and tables- but it's not my favorite place to gamble. I prefer heading to the old Vegas where minimums are between $2 and $5. If you go during the week here, they have them, but you're usually playing by yourself. I prefer playing with a crowded table- I think it makes it more exciting (for Blackjack at least...)

Valet is sometimes a little bit of a pain- especially around check-out time for hotel guests. We've waited 45-minutes for our car. After being hungover and tired, that is the last thing you want to do. Yes, it's free. But it's much quicker to just park in the structure and do a quick little hike to get out faster.

Now, I haven't tried the restaurants on property- however, it looks like they aren't favored by a lot of Yelpers. I usually stick to the binging of buffets to fulfill my hunger.

I am bumping my rating up to 3 stars now, since my second time around wasn't so bad.
Within 2 yrs of my last visit, there has been a noticeable improvement, like a few new restaurants in and around the resort. The area in front of the strip is a nice area for lounging around and people watch.

There is no more solicitors in the main lobby, and the casino lo longer reeks of cigarettes. (Maybe we came in the not so busy season?) ""The Brand"" is still as empty as when we last stayed here. We ate at ""The Café"" for breakfast a few times and the food was quite good with reasonable pricing.

The staff, including the front desk, was very attentive and helpful. We asked to have a refrigerator for our room and they brought that up right away. 

Some drawbacks were the internet and crowded pool. We stayed on the 30th floor and had no internet signal. The Pool was crowded and there was no place to lounge. So it doesn't seem logical to have to pay the 20$ a day resort fee. The carpet\/elevator all seem to be outdated\/ragged. Also there is no reason to have an elevator attendant as

They TURNED OFF OUR ROOM WATER due to renovations (not in our room) without letting us know. Why would they even rent a room where the water service may not be available at all times, didn't even say sorry for the inconvenience.
(Gave us a different room for 1 hour to take shower before checking out).

During booking no one let us know that POOL AREA WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. I would not book it if I've known. During check-in, it was proposed for us to go to Mandalay Bay's pool for free, but its very far  and my husband is disabled and we came by airplane, so you have to pay by yourself to get there, no train between(Mandalay Bay has train connection with Excalibur and Luxor only). Mandalay Bay Pool is nice though.

After check out we went to a restaurant and find out my card was declined as MC CHAREGEDME me TWICE MISTAKELY  from 2 different cards. When I returned to the front desk they said they cannot do anything for us as system not allow to remove the mistaken charge in less than 5 days(again no even apologies) and that we have to decide it by our self to call to our credit card company. My credit card company suggested me to go back to front desk as it's there responsibility (Merchant to card Transaction). After 2 hours waiting they called  my credit card and extra charged was removed by Tony( thank you very much), but why not at the beginning, why I have to stress so much, would that charges stay forever if I just leave. Is it trustful to give your credit card info here, what is it would be $1000.00 and I'll find it later, do I have to wait also 5 days for their mistakes?

    No fridge, not teapot (but I'm ok with that).

Monte Carlo is a great hotel to give it a whirl and the features make it worthwhile for a short weekend getaway. When planning your stay, try to arrive later in the evening so the line is miniscule and the front desk can help you find a room if you'd prefer a view of the Strip. And thank the seven heavens and hells, there is free wi-fi.

If it's been awhile since you stayed in a place that allowed smoking indoors, your lungs will get tested. The casino floor has almost cartoon levels of smog as tourists lean on the slot machine buttons, and suckle a Marlboro to the filter. There are respites from the smoke, but good luck getting a break from the noise, which is probably the point of keeping you on high alert as you're eating, drinking, gambling, and trying to relax. 

Your room and hallway are the few quiet places in the whole building, and the room is nice enough until you realize there is no coffee, HBO, or room service. This is a problem when you get back to your room at arse o'clock and are too tired to stay up until the buffet opens. In lieu of HBO, there are some basic cable options with plenty of commercials for local politicians who have prepared to fight Daesh with their bare hands because Obama is going to take our guns (apparently). Stay excellent, Nevada. \/s

The Monte Carlo does have some terrific parts and one of them is the pool. Be prepared for lots of sun through the day so grab a seat with shade early and don't let it go. The shady side is a bit better about keeping the noise down, but there is a DJ spinning by the wave pool and a woman offering up free shots. There's a wave pool, a sandy beach area, and the lazy river, with plenty of space to shower, complimentary towels and tubes, and massage services. There's an amazing spa upstairs, but I'll gush about that separately.

Those who gamble will have more expertise to share, but if you don't partake, give it a whirl at least once. My style is firmly with the Rat Pack, so it's heartbreaking to see so many slot machines, roulette tables, and card games go digital with touch screens. The MGM and the Bellagio have more modern casino floors. Monte Carlo's casino layout seems leftover from the 80s. For the old school at heart, there are still plenty of dealers working the floor and older slot machines. In the true spirit of the venue, I bet $20, won $15, and lost it all. Good work!

The staff were terrific. It takes a strong nerve to work a maelstrom like Vegas, and while some weren't sure what to recommend in the area, others were able to direct me to restaurants or rentals. The ZipCar rentals are way out of the way by the university, but the Avis was convenient. And if you want to do some sightseeing outside the city, and all the car rental has is a blood red Mustang convertible, remember, ""screw it. I'm in Vegas.",2,1,1

There's a Subway, Mcdonald's and Starbucks downstairs, great for after a long night :-) The cafe downstairs wasn't horrible and it was decently priced for a late night meal (I was craving a quesidilla & bf had chicken and waffles), we skipped the buffet and went to the cosmopolitan's wicked spoon for a bfast buffet. Our room had a handicap shower and a view of the out of season pool and the monorail. I called the operator for a razor and they sent it up pretty quickly, definitely wasn't expecting it so quick. It was a better alternative than going to the CVS and waiting an hour in that humongous line. I really wish they had one of those huge bottles of water in the room, I was so dehydrated that I wouldn't have minded spending an extra $5 on a bottle of water. I know better than to use the hotel's soaps and stuff, so I brought my own. No microwave or fridge, no coffee maker either. Bummer but that's what free alcohol while gambling is for, right?

I felt fairly unsafe and I'm used to dealing with the scum in Vegas. I actually left the elevator before door ever closed when some girl stepped in appearing about to puke.

 Now they charge you to park there as a hotel guest  (And try to justify it with their silly lighting and painting of the concrete).  All blackjack is 6:5 instead if 3:2. Even the machines.

One positive aspect of this place is the location relative to the monorail. It is easy to get to the other casinos where the gambling isn't as awful as this property.

The walls were so thin I heard everything that was coming from our neighbors and passerbys. It felt like people were in the room with us. Every time our neighbors door opened or closed, we jumped because we thought someone had entered our room. On a more positive note, housecleaning was pleasant and did a good job cleaning the room. I guess they have to since we were charged 29$ + tax per day for maintenance. 

Casino:
Some dealers were rude and complete assholes. Getting drinks were nearly impossible because a waitress was hardly around. Also, the drinks were served in ridiculously small glasses. The Bellagio served drinks in bigger glasses and they  tasted better.

Food: 
The buffet was decently priced and surprisingly pretty good. Definitely worth it. They had a good variety even though the venue was smaller than other buffets I've visited.

It's not the cheapest place on the Strip, but it's definitely not the most expensive. However, it's perfectly placed between many other spots, so if the MC doesn't offer enough, it's a quick jaunt to other resorts.

The action in the lounges and casinos are similar: It's not the hottest spot in town, but it's far from dead or boring. So, if you are looking for the wild 'n' crazy Vegas, this ain't it!

As a 40-something married guy, the Monte Carlo is perfect for me and my wife. We can afford the nice suites without breaking the bank, we enjoy the reasonably priced restaurants that offer respectable menus, and can have fun in the casinos and lounges\/bars without feeling overrun by the wild party crowd.

Service is outstanding; always a sense that people are trying to earn well-deserved tips (and when you do tip, the service leaps to extraordinary levels, as it should in Vegas).

The only things that keep it from earning a five-star review are minor details. For instance, the Internet (WiFi or wired) is very slow. The soaps and shampoos are generic and inferior.

Last time I stayed in the Monte Carlo was in 1998. Staying there now is like traveling back in time, only worse. Nothing in the decor has changed, with the exception of a flat screen TV and Wifi. It's like a bad Fairfield Inn or Day's Inn, that happens to charge $250\/night. But that's not even the worst issue.

I stayed there this week for three nights during CES. I was on the 26th floor facing the new arena under construction. The noise from the construction, specifically the ""beeping"" of construction vehicles, started nightly at 3AM. Yes, 3AM, which is a violation of Las Vegas Noise Ordinance 9.16.030, which says construction can't start until 7AM. http:\/\/bit.ly\/1PkBPTn

So maybe MGM, who owns the hotel, can't control construction noise? Well, the construction project with the new arena is their project, on their land. And the hotel doesn't have double pane windows, which is a given in a hotel, so you can hear road and freeway noise, and especially construction at 3AM. Not even using ear plugs helped the situation. You could still hear the noise.

I complained, but they told me they didn't have any more rooms in the morning and that I needed to be back at 430PM to move my bags to another room there, or they would give it away. Granted, this is the busiest business conference of the year. I don't really want to interrupt business meetings to travel 1 hr back to the hotel to move my bags.

I was so tired from a lack of sleep for three days that I was grateful to be home. Providing a quiet place to sleep, free of construction noise at 3AM, is basic. If I want a bad experience, I won't pay $250\/night to be woken up, in a dated hotel.

The hotel also wanted to charge my company 1 night stay for checking out 1 day early, even though I checked out at 9AM. They had the chance to provide the room for someone else and still charged us.

Needless to say, I won't be going back to the Monte Carlo, and maybe any other MGM property after this mess. IMHO, I don't believe that you should stay here either.",0,0,0

The only complain I do have was the parking and the people who clean the rooms. To start off, the parking was a hassle to get in and out after it was charged to my room because the activation never went through all the times it was activated. It was a hassle having to phone in the front desk in the parking structure to let me out. On to the next problem which really made me mad. I had took some individual sized chip bags that I took for my son. Well the person who cleaned our room took some of my sons chips.

1. Location is fantastic. You're in a centralized location on the strip and  you can walk or shuttle it (what is that light-rail lookin' thing?) easily. 
2. Check-in is a bitch. There isn't one single line - you line up at each individual employee. This is confusing and dumb and frustrating. 
3. Our room was awesome. It was a suite that overlooked the pools. Came with internet, flat-screen TV, couch, fridge, two bathrooms. However, the shower water was low-pressure, lukewarm, and the sinks didn't drain properly. 
4. Eating is easy. There is a fast-food court and a handful of restaurants that cover steaks, mexican, asian, brewpub. Whatever you're looking for. And room service is fucking the best EVER. Yeah, you pay a lot: It's ROOM SERVICE. But it comes fast, they don't forget anything, the portions are pretty big, and the ingredients are top-notch. You can really taste where that extra cash is going. 
5. The casino bar (was there only one? that's all I saw) is overpriced at $6 for a bottled domestic, but hey - you are on the strip and the room was cheap, so suck it up. 
6 & 7: The chapel and catering departments. 
Top-notch since day one. Every call answered. Every voicemail returned. Every email responded to. Many choices in regards to food and even decor. They do your flowers and photos. Both are not as expensive as you would think, either. I hate flowers - my flowers were freakin BEAUTIFUL. For the ceremony, the chapel shuttles you in and out QUICK after meticulously explaining what you're supposed to be doing (""walk when I say GO!"") Open bar? Not that expensive! We went with a buffet-style dinner and it was freakin delish. Long list of choices... I mean LONG... and it didn't taste like a buffet at all. Came with salads, crudites, and a dessert table in addition to the wedding cake! Open bar included red bull - now how nifty is that??

Absolutely the best, no, much much more than the best value for the price you pay. 
However... they will nickel-and-dime the shit out of you. No free rooms or hefty discounts (just little tiny ones) even when you're dumping a shitload of money into one four-hour party.

I decided to go on a budget hotel this time around and this fit the billing. I had the M Life Rewards that knocked down the price of 2 nights here to the mid $30 range. As other Yelpers have reviewed, this place is in a remodel phase. It's obvious with all the closed off sections and the loud drilling going on. Upon walking in, I showed up early as my flight landed earlier then usual. There was a line leading to self check in kiosks and a line leading to the front desk. It was slightly confusing as it seemed the designated line overlapped both. I walked to the desk check in and got a funny vibe from two of the staff. None of them seemed to acknowledge my existence standing there. It seemed the lady working glanced up and looked back down. She seemed to mumble something to the guy who finally after a few seconds nodded at me to come forward.  What bothered me about this interaction was the lady helped an elderly couple behind me and immmediately turned on the charm and smiles. So you're telling me you don't treat all customers the same way huh? Anyway...the guy was helpful and got me a room for early check in as one was ready. He pointed me to where the room was and gave me a tip about using the tram to get to the middle of the strip for free. Kudos to him. Can't say the same about the female  working with him. As for the room, they gave me an updated version which isn't bad. But you can tell people have already broken the room in with some faded stains on the carpet. The bed and bathroom looked fairly modernized and theres a new Samsung TV in the room also. At the time of this review there appears to be a restaurant downstairs that's open, but I don't see any other options. Guessing the remodel is holding off any other eating options for now. The beauty of Vegas is there's always something to eat somewhere so that's not a biggie for me. I'm guessing once the remodel is done the Monte Carlo may be a better hotel. For now it's pretty standard and budget friendly.",1,0,0

I feel that should be the new ad slogan because I haven't had the most positive experience with this place in the past, but time and time again I would book a room here because for a centrally located strip hotel, it ranked as one of the cheaper options. 

and then each time I stayed I was rudely reminded why.

Let's see, where can I start: the rooms are drab, the window views are dismal, even when you're looking out the 'front of the hotel' you see a crap view of empty lots and the freeway.  The restaurants are nothing special and there is not hot nightclub venue that draws in the nightcrowd.  This place is like the Holiday Inn Express of the strip, clean but boring, and purely a place to sleep and maybe partake in the buffet.

So this trip my friend who booked the room asked me what my hotel prefs were and I said 'I dont really care, just prefer no Monte Carlo'  and of course guess where we ended up.

However this time around I noticed the whole experience felt different.  Ever since the completion and opening of MGM Group's crown jewel Aria City Center, i suspect they have infused a bit more cash and life into this once drab resort.  It's not glaringly obvious but little things like the rooms, amenities and service seem much better, and their shops have new additions with the biggest plus...internal walkway to City Center connecting it to Aria and no longer making the hotel feel like a cut off locked in the attic stepchild.  Also access to the tram gives you free mobility to go to City Center and Bellagio with a gorgeous almost futuristic view of that section of the strip in AC'ed tinted windowed comfort.  Even the crappy pool area seems to have new life as I tried the lazy river and wave pools which seemed quite fun.

Whatever MGM did, they sucessfully transformed MC from a solid 'bleah' to 'yeah its ok' hotel in my mind.  The style, amenities and rooms will never approach a Palazzo or Wynn level, but I feel like its not meant to, and thats ok, because you dont have to pay those level prices either.",1,0,1

I recently contacted MLife on Thursday 9\/7\/2017 at approximately 4-4:30pm and was transferred to Monte Carlo's VIP services because of my inquiry regarding Hotel32.

I was interested in changing my three upcoming room reservations at Aria to stay at Hotel32 and Monte Carlo; however when I inquired about promotions I was simply provided an answer of ""NO"".

I am a frequent Las Vegas visitor and my previous experiences with MLife and more importantly Aria VIP services have been the greatest in customer service that I have had, with representatives assisting me with additional suggestions for my 40th Birthday as well as going above and beyond to finding me the best rates for my stay.

However my experience with the Monte Carlo VIP service representative has tarnished all that was great which I experienced.  Being transferred to any ""VIP"" service representative, I believe there are certain expectations to be fulfilled on the representatives side such as asking for the requested date of stay, offering to check booking system, and then offer a listing of current rates to allow me to decide if they were viable options for me. (Simple common sense, customer service protocol to attract guests to stay or visit the property) Instead I was provided with a firm ""NO"" and the call was complete.  

Unfortunately, this recent experience with the representative at Monte Carlo VIP services has prompted me to not only change my mind about staying at the Monte Carlo, but has also prompted me to cancel my three reservations at Aria that I secured for my 40th Birthday as it is also an MGM property.

If the Monte Carlo plans to compete with the likes of the Cosmopolitan and the Cromwell boutique hotel\/casinos once they have fully renovated to Park MGM and Nomad I hope they also look at their ""VIP"" staff as well.",1,0,0

I will never step foot in the Monte Carlo again. We actually have 2 more nights here and I'm booking rooms at another resort.

First off, it's all torn up, construction everywhere, basically the whole casino floor is shut down. Why in the hell would you not disclose to people making reservations that your entire hotel is under construction. 

No food? We came back here at 11p our first night planning to eat.  You can't, there's no food. Vending machine or go to another hotel.... seriously?  Why am I paying a resort fee? 

The new signature rooms are a joke. They look like your crazy aunt watched too much flip or flop and had a $150 budget at the goodwill to decorate.  No fridge, no coffee maker, no microwave. Towels made of, I believe, sandpaper.  Couch doesn't match the chair, chair doesn't match the table, none of them go with this hideous lamp. Seriously, whoever thought this lamp was a good idea should probably be given their walking papers. 

Now the view, not too bad, we paid extra for the strip view. Now if I could only see it through this window. It's so dirty that the first half of the day while the sun hits it, the dirt is so bright you can barely see through it. The MGM is directly across the street and all I can see is a big dark blob. 

Then, for some reason before 5am construction started on our floor, hammering and drilling in the room right next to us. After an hour, now almost 7am, they moved to the room on the other side of us and started all over again.  

The walls are paper thin, listening to the construction crews open and shut the blinds next door literally sounded like it was coming from inside our room. You can also here every conversation going on down the hall, doors closing, etc.

the only other good thing was the front desk clerk.  our csr was named phoung and she helped us out very quickly and was very cheerful as well.  

cons... the hotel is showing it's age.  went here when it had first opened, and it was so much more of a vegas hotel.  now it's luster has gone and it is just another hotel that just happens to be on the las vegas strip, nothing special.  it's not super bad but for the price it's not really worth it either. 

the other thing which was missing was a good place to eat, like a restaurant on the ground floor or something.  i didn't much expect to see just a sign saying, ""buffet"" and ""diner"" or something to that effect.  the food was edible but nothing special.  the one other good thing is that you can get a 2 for 1 deal on the breakfast.  

the elevators were in horrible shape.  doors all banged up and scratched, it's not so much the appearance of the doors, yeah they are elevator doors, but they didn't even close right.  if you happen to be nice and hold the door open for a straggler, the alarm would sound, and then the doors would slowly, noisily, screech their way close.  one door had a large gouge taken out of it, and was severely dented.  not once in the 4 days that i was there, did i see anyone cleaning or wiping down the elevators.  in other hotels along the strip they have whole battalions of people cleaning, dusting, moping, sweeping, and polishing anything that wasn't human.  that was not the case at this hotel. 

as for the rest of the casino, it was typical las vegas, confusing carpet patterns, every where you look, looks exactly the same so you get lost inside the casino.  the lights are perpetually muted so you don't know what time it is.  the heavy oppressive smell of smoke, you don't see the smoke but you can really smell it.  

t.v. here sucked.  my buddy's room had a poltergeist t.v. which turned on in the middle of the night and would turn off, remote would change channels and volume but wouldn't turn it off, and even the button on the actual set wouldn't turn it off.  oh and our room didn't even have the ""do not disturb"" door tag, or any note paper as well.    

all in all a pretty disappointing hotel to stay at.  i would expect this type of hotel off the strip, nothing fancy about the front, nothing eye catching, nothing to say, ""hey look at me and come in for a good time"".
in fact, this hotel should be moved out somewhere off the strip.  it's like a second class hotel charging first class prices.  not a good place.  i would rather stay next door at new york, new york then here.",2,0,1

The Monte Carlo sent me an email to upgrade from their standard room to a suite for $40\/night and since I was going to Vegas for my wife and I's anniversary I figured why not.  BIG MISTAKE! 
I asked for a room\/suite on a higher floor and that didn't happen. They first gave us a room on the 3rd floor with a view of an ac unit. It was also near the elevator which resulted in a lot of noise in our room.  I called and talked to the front desk and they offered me a room on the 12th floor. Saying that was the best that they had and all of the suites are located by the elevator due to the size or something like that. I took them up on their offer for a room on the higher for which happened to be available that next day.  I wish I would've stayed on the third floor. The room on the 12th floor that we had was completely in shambles. The wallpaper was peeling off the wall, the sink in the main bathroom was cracked, the towel rod was hanging off from the wall, the towel hook was loose and just spinning freely, all of the furniture was dinged up scratched and just in horrible condition and the sink in the small bathroom was broken and the stopper did not work.  Not to mention the window film was half peeled off on the only window that overlooked more of the roof. Needless to say I've stayed at the Monte Carlo multiple times and the rooms were always in good condition.  And the resort fee... what a joke! There were no amenities that we could utilize for the ""resort"". The Wi-Fi was free anyway. And again everything else was shut down so none of the amenities could be used because of construction. So, for an average of $208 a night I would've expected something better then the quality that you would find at a cheap $40 a night Motel6 or something like that.  And when I filled out the survey that they emailed me I voiced my concerns and now, 2 1\/2 weeks later I have yet to hear from anyone. Do not stay at the Monte Carlo!

No wake up calls here. Because if the construction at 4AM didn't wake you up, the roller coaster next door will keep you awake all night anyway. 

Restaurants here sucked. Their house ""Cafe"" (where their room service comes from, btw) was extremely gag-worthy. The brewery is a decent place to get a drink and watch sports on their large screen, but if you are planning to eat, I'd really suggest going to a different hotel, or just filling up with more beer.

First night in our room on the 7th floor I had a terrible coughing\/sneezing attack where I threw up and couldn't leave the room.  The air conditioner didn't work so after the first night we kept it off.  The last night we were there I went to ask for an oscillating fan, they didn't have one but she sent an ""engineer"" to let on at our air conditioner.  The picture is what he found.  He told us not to look because it's disgusting!  I snapped a picture and went to complain.  The manager did the bare minimum by offering us $50 room service credit that wasn't available during our stay (we were leaving the next morning) and waived our resort fee that shoulda been waived in the first considering the pool was closed.  We could use a sister pool that was over a mile walk...still unacceptable!!

I am severely allergic to dust and can have an asthma attack because of it that leads to vomiting.  Now, I understand that when I travel the room is never going to be up to my standards...I accept that.  But...when we approached the resort\/hotel manager we asked when the room had been last serviced...she said that she didn't have access to the maintenance records.

For the $50 credit they wanted us to go to another hotel to use it.

I am completely appalled by the level of sanitation this resort provided us.  They are minimum was done, credit for room service couldn't be used and it was overall just completely gross.  It looks like this filter handy been replaced for a year.   Stay at your own risk!!!!",1,0,0

You can even stay in the urban jungle of Manhattan (New York, New York) or join Dorothy and company on their fanciful journey to Oz (the MGM Grand). For comfort with a touch of Old World Mediterranean grandeur and Riviera luxury, check into the Monte Carlo. All 3,002 guest rooms are spacious, decorated in brown and beige tones, with rich cherrywood furniture, plush carpeting, and Italian marble and granite bathrooms with brass fixtures. Junior suites have a sitting area, dining table and chairs, and an additional half bath. The property's 21,000 square-foot pool area, a tropical oasis where one can escape from the glaring desert sun, features cascading waterfalls, lush landscaping, and a number of swimming pools, including a meandering easy river ride, where one can use an inner tube or raft to float among the towering palms, and a wave pool that recreates the movement of the ocean. There are three tennis courts, lit for night play, and a morning clinic with lessons, ball machine, and racquet rental, and a fitness center, although the $22 per day charge for hotel guests is excessive, in my opinion. As in all major Vegas properties, there is a 24-hour casino, featuring more than 2,100 slot and video poker machines, blackjack, high-limit gaming areas, a poker room, baccarat, roulette, keno, and a full service race and sports betting area. Gamers can receive awards by joining ""The One Club,"" which tracks slot and table play. Dining options include one of the city's most elaborate buffets.

There are still a few upsides to the place:
- Excellent mid-strip location: next to the new City Center and NYNY, and walking or tram distance to all kinds of other good stuff.
- Seems to be about the cheapest place on the strip without dipping into the potentially nasty category of rooms (yes, we're talking about you, IP and Luxor).
- Lazy River and ""Wave Pool"" (more of a slosh-pool) are fun for summer, although the corrugated steel backdrop from the City Center ain't pretty, even if it does shield you from the Vdara Death Ray,
- Staff is all-around super cool, except for the check-in girl, who wouldn't take my $20 bribe, er, tip to upgrade my room. 
- Diablo's (see my review on that fun place) and The Pub.

And about those downsides:
- That beat-up room:  scratches on the wall, fading carpet, dinged-up furniture, and in 2010, can we at least graduate from the 19"" old-school Trinitron to something HD?
- $8.50 Bud Light at the pool? 
- Bag inspections for contraband while entering the pool area.  I think the staff is aware that people make take measures to avoid a $8.50 alumibottle of glorified water.

The rooms were very nice, and I never had any problems with room service or cleanliness. I loved that there was a food court. Made it very easy when we wanted a quick bite before going out for the day, but didn't want to spend a lot of money or time. 

Check in and out went quickly. The only thing that would have been nice was more night life in the hotel. Thankfully, it is attached to The Aria, which had some nice bars with amazing margaritas and mojitos.

It has a great location, it is arguably in the middle of the strip.  The casino is nice, has a nice number of restaurants and cheap eats places.  Self Parking was very convenient and valet was great, the high level room we had was very nice.  We paid extra and got a room at the 31st floor with a great view of New York New York and based on other reviews I don't think the rooms are used as much.  I would suggest to pay the extra $15 and get the high floor rooms. The bed was fantastic- having a bad back many hotel room beds suck and here the mattress was as good as I have at home.  The pool also was very nice.  The bar at the front of the casino was great we used coupons that the casino gave us and the bartender comped our drinks because we were playing video poker.  I did have to tell the hooker that sat next to me  I was married - but hey that's Vegas.

The problem with the Monte Carlo comes down to the fact that it is almost twenty years old and the rooms need a makeover.  It was obviously a luxury hotel when it opened but by todays standards not so much; that said it is still a very nice hotel and would stay here again.

My worst experience here was at the breakfast buffet.   I used some MyVegas points for a free buffet and got in the high roller line to get in because at the Bellagio that was the line they told me to get in to when I got lunch the day before.  The cashier at the Monte Carlo snarled at me, and treated me like I committed a felony.  When I pointed out that the Bellagio policy she was indignant and told me that at the Monte Carlo they are different or something that she couldn't verbalize.  She should be fired for her attitude, don't remember her name but it did ruin my breakfast which thank goodness I didn't pay for because the buffet wasn't very good.

When I book a hotel room, I look for a comfortable bed and cleanliness. I found that here at the Monte Carlo! The staff is outstanding, I must say. At any moment that I needed anything housekeeping was always available and met my needs. The casino dealers and attendants were also super friendly and attentive to my needs. Check-in went smoothly as well as check out. As a matter of fact when I first went up to my room on the 23rd floor I discovered they had given me a hotel room with a Strip view which was awesome enough. The Bell desk was helpful with car rental and holding my luggage until I was ready to leave the hotel since my check out was way earlier then my flight was. Waiting for an elevator was not a problem either . I never waited not more than one minute for an elevator to come . Yes, there was some construction going on but nothing that stopped a show or ruined your night or day.

If you are a young party animal, then the Monte Carlo might not be the most bangin' place, not the most upscale (although, personally, I think the place is quite adequate).

But if you are a soccer mom or dad who wants to take the fam bam to Vegas and you want to stay on the Strip, then Monte Carlo is a viable option for you! They have a lazy river and wave pool that the kids will love. My little ones hardly eat, so taking them to a Las Vegas buffet is often not the most economical thing to do, as you will not get your money's worth, given how they eat like birds. But at Monte Carlo, not only do you have the standard buffet fare, they have a food court in the premises that will suit many a child's dining needs, such as Subway, Sbarro, Rubio's, Starbucks, and some Chicken Tenders place.

Then, if the kids want to try something else, there are other places to eat outside the Monte Carlo that is just within walking distance, like Denny's, the Hard Rock Cafe, Fatburger, and the Hawaiian Marketplace ain't that much further away. The M&Ms store is just across the street and is often a hit with the little kids.

And you're just next door to New York, New York, if the kiddos want to ride their rollercoasters. And the MGM is just at the corner. You can walk to enough places if you don't want to deal with the hassle of driving through a lot of pedestrians and general traffic, unless you want to head to the northern Strip (in which case, grab a Lyft or Uber).",4,0,0

I love the lobby here, it gives off a wonderful aura that is Vegas in a classy way. Lots of patrons there to check you in and check you out and they are extremely nice and courteous. My complaint lies with their policy that they cannot guarantee you the exact room that you put a deposit on. My husband booked this hotel as a surprise for my birthday. Vegas is a favorite city of mine. He is a smoker, while I am not, but I know the importance of needing to have a smoking room while you are staying at a Vegas hotel. Not sure why Vegas is adapting the California non smoking laws, but it is what it is. When we arrived to check in, we were told that there were no more spa suite rooms on smoking floors. My husband was furious as he should have been. It's such an inconvenience to have to go down to the casino to smoke one cigarette. We called in a manager and he was very nice and apologetic. He offered to upgrade us, but we wanted to spa suite because the spa was in the window overlooking the strip, not in a bathroom. Needless to say, our room was not available, but by the grace of God, a room that was not showing up in the system because it was out of order to to carpet shampooing popped up. We took it. We were given a $100 food and beverage credit from the manager, which was very appreciated and definitely was used while we were there.

The spa suite was large and spacious. A full bar (not stocked, but I love it when there's a fridge so I can chill my water bottles), separate toilet from the rest of the bathroom, comfortable bed, nice television and the spa was right in the window. The spa was right in the window....overlooking the airport and freeway. Totally sucked, but we did get the room that we wanted. The walls are paper thin here. We could hear the neighbors tv on which seemed to never be turned off, and we could hear anytime a neighbor flushed their toilet, showered and we could totally hear the loud bang every time the toilet stopped running after someone flushed. It woke me up a ton of times throughout the night.

Other things I'd like to mention:

Parking structure is easy to get to, ample parking. and totally easy to find your way to and from the hotel from the structure. The mall inside here was great. They have just about everything. Starbucks that is in this hotel is one of the larger ones I've come across in Vegas and they have a good selection of food there as well, we actually found an Italian restaurant here that we ate at both nights we were there, it was delicious (d.vino)!. Clean casino and it didn't reek of cigarettes and booze. I would totally stay here again as long as we were guaranteed the room we booked. A tip that the manager told us: call the day before you're coming so they can block that room out for you so it will be guaranteed.",2,0,0

Location isn't awesome, but it's close enough to the popular places on the strip so you can walk (Ladies - it's a bit of a walk. So be prepared for hurting feet or don't wear heels) but we did use a cab to get to the Venetian. 

Check in was a PAIN! We got there on Friday around 3:30, and it was starting to get busy. We finally got to the front desk, and they said there was a problem with the rooms (we got two adjacent rooms, one across the way, and one was down the hall...) and the guy acted rather snooty. We had to wait while he ""fixed"" the problem, and we had requested adjoining rooms but he didn't give us that. I was just glad to finally get inside the room! 

Beds were comfortable, A\/C worked, TVs were nice, everything was fairly clean.  My complaint is the shower. It was like a high-powered mist. Takes a few extra minutes to ensure everything is actually CLEAN because of the power of the shower.  Not awesome. Room service was speedy (we were still inside the room when they initially passed by, the lady waited for us to leave and then cleaned it) and we never had to call the front desk for anything extra. The towels did have a strange smell (like burnt?) but I didn't mind it much. 

We stayed here because it is CHEAP compared to the other places on the strip, and all we were doing here was sleeping and getting ready. 

I didn't gamble much (just the slots for the free drinks) so I can't really say much about that. 

OH... if you stay here, definitely check out Diablo's. That place is cool at night. They push the tables out of the way and it becomes a dance floor. Bartenders are fast and make the drinks well... but they abruptly shut down and close around 3AM (I think? Haha). They turned off the music mid-song, turned up the lights, and ushered everyone out. Kind of a buzzkill, but we just moved on to the next place. A good place to start off the night if you're staying here.",1,0,0

Worst decision ever.  Originally booked a deluxe king room and paid the upgrade fee at check-in for a high room. Immediately disappointed upon entering the room. Carpets were stained and dirty. Air conditioner was sub-par and didn't cool the room. Minimal electrical outlets that were not near the bed which made it inconvenient to charge our phones. No mini refrigerator or coffee pot in the room like every other hotel provides in their deluxe rooms. Minimal TV channel selection. Bathrooms have no fan or heater so the mirrors fog up every time you take a shower and the shower water pressure is terrible. Doors do not have any additional locks inside the rooms for safety when in room or sleeping -- the only lock was the basic keycard which is horrible because that is a basic safety issue.

The price of this hotel definitely does not meet with the accommodations it provides.  In all honesty, I have stayed at remodeled Motel 6 locations on road trips that were 100% better than this 4 star hotel. There are tons of other hotels on the strip that have the same rate and are actually worth the price. I will never stay at this hotel again and do not recommend it.",0,0,0

At first, I was SUPER nervous about staying here because of all the bad reviews I've seen. But once I entered the hotel, I was at ease. The room was clean and spacious enough. I liked how the hotel had many amenities such as the lazy pool, gym, spa, casinos and shopping center. It gave me and my best friend a lot of choices. Also, I think the Monte Carlo is the only hotel that has a food court (McDonald's, Subway, Starbucks, Sabarros, etc), which is very helpful on those drunk nights. I also loved where on the strip the Monte Carlo was located. The only reason why I am rating it a 4 stars experience is because there is not a fridge or microwave in the deluxe regular rooms. I had to go down to the lobby and ask the manager if I can warm my leftovers up in their microwave. But  for the price I paid to stay on the strip, I would say it is DEFINITELY worth it.

My husband and I have been staying at the Monte Carlo for years, but NEVER AGAIN. 

Since I was so looking forward to this trip, I was almost in tears once we walked in the door and began to walk around.  There's a big wall\/road block in the middle of the casino and all the gaming tables were moved towards the front of the hotel.  If I had to guess, I would say a little more than half the slot machines are gone.  The card room was gone.  One of our favorites, The Pub, and all the stores in the hall leading to the shuttle and Aria, gone.  When we booked our stay, we were not informed of the construction\/remodel of the hotel.  It felt like we were in an old, dirty motel.  Totally blindsided . . . 

Negative - - The pool was closed (brilliant, it's summer Monte Carlo, if you didn't notice) and they expected you to ""Pool Hop"" to either the MGM or Mandalay Bay hotels.  Like anyone really wants to travel to a pool, get all wet, sweaty and then travel back to your hotel...this is ridiculous.  Of course they are not compensating the guests for this and are still charging a full Resort Fee.  At this point, calling the Monte Carlo a resort is laughable.  

Another negative - - We completed the online pre-check in that we received the day before arrival since we would be arriving prior to 3PM.  Understood that we might not get to check in early, but they told us to get out of line unless we received an email telling us we could check in early.  Meanwhile, others were in line checking in early.  We never received the email with our room number as promised and ended up waiting over an hour to check in which is totally unacceptable.  Four employees working the Front Desk does not scream excellent customer service.  

Another negative - - NOISE from the construction!!!  Are you kidding me?  We were on the 16th floor and the noise started at 6:00AM.  OMG, no sleep to be had once that started.  It was banging, drilling and vibrations so loud that at times, it was almost impossible to have a phone conversation.  

I will not deny the Monte Carlo needs to be upgraded to compete with all the fancier hotels with the shopping areas.  The guest rooms are sorely in need of upgrades to include outlets for charging electronics.  The carpeting in the entire hotel should be replaced.  The decision they made to do this at the expense of their unwitting guests is inexcusable.  

It might have been better to just close for a few months than to chase away your regular guests and receive an avalanche of negative reviews here and on social media.  You have a rough road ahead to earn back those who were cheated out of our ""Resort"" vacation and rely on these reviews when making their decision on where to stay.",1,0,0

We were grateful they let us check in at 9am. The beds are comfy enough but the pillows were too firm, even for a side sleeper like me. Even though housekeeping cleaned the room, I feel the bathroom floors weren't properly mopped. I was glad I brought my own toiletries since their soap was too drying on my skin. The towels are yellowed and some of em have that funky smell. Yeah, I know. Ewwww.

Points for the pool area, they had much comfortable pool chairs than the ones at Mandalay Bay. Look for the shaded areas around the Palm trees, you want to get tanned, not fried, especially in scorching Vegas summers.

I do like the fact that CVS pharmacy is nearby for last minute sun essentials. But if you're looking for moleskin, (for all night partying in sky-high heels, THIS is my secret!) go to Walgreens across the street.

They have a normal food court! People love to go to Vegas party it up, live like rock stars splurge on bottles, clubs, dinners. But at some point cheap and easy is needed. They have a food court with Mcdonald's and Subway and some other fast food. 

At 5 in the morning, when I'm getting back from a casino or club I really don't want to go to a SUPER over priced cafe which will charge me $15 for nachos or an omelette just because choices are limited. Good Job Monte Carlo! When I stay at Aria I definitely walk 1 hotel over to Monte Carlo for a quick bite.

Casino, basic pretty standard, they have enough tables and machines for their customer base. reasonable minimums for their price range too. 

Rooms are standard, nothing fancy or memorable.

They send a good amount of comps too. I've had some weekends where other hotels in its class were full or expensive, and they sent me free comps for that weekend. 

From several stays there, I can recall 1 incident where the front desk took about 25 minutes to check me in, when there was no one else in front of me... they just had no one at the desk. That wasn't too fun.

I haven't seen the Jabbawockeez show so I can't speak on that, but I'm sure it's fall of nice choreography.

This is the first time I stayed at the Monte Carlo (MC) and it wasn't bad. I went with a friend of mine for the 4th of July weekend and she chose the MC because she wanted to relax. The MC is definitely a nice hotel if you want to relax because there are not many ""young singles"" running around the hotel. There are no clubs\/lounges in this hotel so if you are a ""young single"" and you're looking for the nightlife, you will definitely have to leave the hotel and go somewhere else.

At check in, the hotel staff was polite and ""there for you."" I arrived before my friend and she called the hotel to allow me to check in. When I went to check in there were no issues, which was great because sometimes it becomes an issue when you don't make the original reservations. Once I arrived at the room everything thing seem to be in order. The bathroom was a nice size (big enough for me and her to get ready at the same time). The only issue I really had with the hotel was that the hotel windows were filthy. And the view was nice, you could see the MGM Grand among other things; but the windows were dirty. That would be the most negative thing I have to say.

We laid by the pool a good bit and there were two separate pools. The far side pool was a ""lazy river"" and that allowed you to rent tubes and let the water push you around the course. I would suggest to get to the pool early in order to get pool side seating otherwise you will be SOL; luckily my friend was up early to reserve seats. The hotel does have a food court that allowed you to eat ""cheaper"" than the average restaurant in Vegas. They have a Subway, McDonalds, Sbarro, Manchu Wok and I think a few others.

First off, we got to the hotel and checked in. Surprisingly really busy... tons of people seemed to be checking in at 9pm. 

Here comes *strike 1*: we ask the lady at the front desk what the wifi password was. She proceeds to ask us ""what password? our wifi is open"", so naturally, I went ""YES! free wifi in the rooms"", when she proceeded to say ""oh, no. We don't have wifi in the rooms. We only have wifi in the main lobby here and in the food court"". Wiped the smile off my face. Right away. Just a little back story, I wanted to travel light so I traveled with my tablet and I was doing a lot of the social media work remotely. Couldn't really do that now because the internet in the room was only connectable via ETHERNET CABLES! Seriously bro? Ethernet cables? I think the Monte Carlo missed the coming of the digital age because event the Super 8 motel has wireless wifi. LAME SAUCE

Anywhooos, we got our keys and went up to the room. It was your standard room with 2 queen beds, a tv, bathroom- the usual. The beds were very comfy. Bathroom? Meh. It was your average bathroom... nothing that really surprised me. The shower heads were surprisingly VERY powerful, which made me happy. 

Here comes *strike 2*: went down to use the wifi in the main lobby just to make a quick FaceTime call via. I was under the impression that the wifi was going to work because I was told that it only worked in the main lobby and the food court. WRONG. can't even get a decent connection in the main lobby. 

and for *strike 3*: room service takes an awfully long time for low periods during the day. I would call for blankets and pillows at 10pm, when I anticipate that not many people would be calling for these items at that hour of the day, but apparently room service's phone was ringing off the hook because I wouldn't get the items until 45 minutes after I called for them! I also had to remind them that I called... and then they'd finally come. 

I would not stay here again. The location is great, but for the price you pay- so not worth it. A resort fee for internet? There was no internet in my room.

Upon arrival, we waited about 30 minutes in the check-in line. We were able to check in early, which was a plus. The rooms, as the hotel, are very dated. When you think of Vegas you think vibrant, fun and young.... that's not what the Monte Carlo is, at ALL! 
The shower kept leaking, it smelled like weed from the room next door and the worst part - the pool was closed. They offered up the pools at MGM but that too was closed one of the days, which was a complete bummer. 
Not only was the hotel a flop but a few days after I got home, I noticed super itchy bug bites all over my body, specifically my feet. I went to the doctor and he confirmed that they are most likely BED BUG BITES.

1) My boyfriend and I went here for Valentine's Day and were thoroughly displeased. First of all,  I took a shower before I getting ready for dinner, and the shower pressure was so high it felt like a hurricane and was piercing my skin. After five minutes, I had to get out it was so painful, and there was no visible way of turning it down. 

2) Although a minor detail, the sink did not drain properly, making it hard to comfortably wash your face or hands.

3) When my boyfriend and I finally made our way into bed after our night out (mind you, it was about two in the morning), we opened the sheets to find STAINS. We immediately called room service, and as we waited for 45 minutes, we fell asleep. When she finally came in, she explained to us that she was the only one working that night, and the hotel was empty. She then went on to tell us that her job was really hard because almost all the guests every night complain about dirty sheets. 

UM... I think that's when it's time to get new sheets. EW.

As she was explaining this to us, she went through ten sheets just to find a new one that was clean. 

She then went on to tell us that the hotel had really gone downhill and was not getting much business.

If I may give some advice to the hotel, I would say make sure your staff isn't telling your guests dirty secrets, and disgusting them.

Although I asked my boyfriend to please call downstairs, from what she said we decided that getting a new room wouldn't help. We uncomfortably tried to sleep from there out, but I still don't feel comfortable that I didn't complain.

The hotel and casino are extremely tired and in desperate need of renovation.  The casino floor is so tired, it's down right depressing.  The slot machines still have gold-colored trim (remember when that was a popular styling choice?  Neither do I.  It's been a long time).  The pool area is crammed to the gills with chairs, laid out so that too much of is shaded, and not relaxing in the least.  The free wi-fi is unusable.

All that said, location, location, location.  There isn't a better one on the strip.

And the management and staff are doing a great job with what they've been given to work with.  My room was very clean, the bed was comfortable, the linens were soft, and everything in the hotel and casino seemed to be in good working order, if a little dinged up.

Further, it's priced just where it should be (I think I averaged $130\/night over a 3-night stay on Labor Day weekend, not including the egregious $28\/day resort fee). 

Pro tip, go for the strip view.  Not for the view, but because the half-hearted attempt to turn an already lame pool area into a ""day club"" leaves the side of the building facing the pool rattling with a ""bmmm tsss bmmm tsss"" from the DJ, 10am (?!?!) to 7pm.

The value for the hotel is great (usually can find a room for around $40-50\/night). They've included a 'resort fee' now of $12.95 a day which includes wired internet (no wifi) and 2 bottles of water a day.

I think all hotels now charge a 'resort fee' which includes the internet service (wired or wireless). I've always gotten the internet fees as I need to be able to work through VPN so the 'added' bonus of 2 bottles of water is nice.

It is an older hotel and does not have a wet bar or fridge. The rooms are average and the pool is ok. They do have a 'wave' river where you can float around all day but there's nothing spectacular about the pool.

The hotel is located a little south on the strip and isn't near the Tram. You can walk a block or two to MGM Grand and catch a tram from there to get to the Convention Center or the other hotels. Diablo is a bar that is connected to the hotel and faces the strip. It gets a little wild around Cinco De Mayo (which is when I was last there).

Normally we try to stay at the venetian or bellagio but the pocket book was a bit light and a bargain seemed like a good idea.  This trip was to celebrate our first anniversary and it was our first true vacation since our wedding so needless to say we were very excited.   The night before our flight we called to confirm our room and it was all gravy.

The next day we arrive and are told that there was a ""problem with the suites"" and we would be downgraded to a normal room.   I'm on my f'ing anniversary and only vacation this year and this is what I'm stuck with.  The ""manager"" wasn't even all that apologetic, in fact she was pretty indifferent, kind of like the treatment that we have all become accustomed to receiving from airline employees... the ""I couldn't possibly care less about you"" attitude.

So we called the four seasons, they gave us a great rate with an UPGRADE to a room that has arguably the best view of the strip in all of Vegas and treated us like royalty for our whole trip (I'm gonna write a detailed review for them as well).

Personally, I couldn't care less about my hotel room in Vegas; I'm not here to spend any time in it. As long as it's clean, well-presented and isn't a rundown shithole akin to Circus Circus, anything will do. I booked an online deal for $49\/night. That was attractive. What wasn't attractive were the room fees which are added onto your bill involuntarily. I think they charged me something like $16\/day for wi-fi access (which I didn't use), pool access (which I used once), fitness center access (which I didn't use), and a few other amenities which, you guessed it, I didn't use. I would prefer these were available to guests a la carte since I didn't plan to employ most of them. 

The rooms are nice, but far from decadent. I paid about $40 extra to get a ""strip view"" room. Unfortunately, they didn't mention that the strip I'd be viewing was the strip mall across the street. The angle of my window left me with an obscured view of the MGM Grand and the ginormous condo tower next door. As I hadn't been here before, I had no idea that my view would suck as much as it did. So, though the cheap upgrade might seem worthwhile, I assure you it is not. 

I had heard from a friend that the walls are thin here. I didn't hear any moans or groans, but the fact that I can hear the person on either side flushing their toilet didn't jive with me too well. I don't need an audible confirmation everytime my neighbor takes a dump. 

Parking was great here. Got a spot on the 2nd level, which leads to the lobby, with ease. And it's free. Can't beat that. 

The pool here is grossly oversold on their website, though. The ""regular"" pool is oddly-shaped, small and crowded. The lazy river is more like a crowded stream. And the wave generator pool is about half the size of the one at Wild Rivers and, yep, crowded. Even worse, the lounge chairs are practically stacked on top of each other, and finding a seat that doesn't appear to be claimed by an anonymous towel is nigh impossible. We just brushed a couple off and snagged some seats. There's a pool bar, but bring plenty of lube because you'll be brutally raped by prices. 

I'd stay here again, but only if I can continue to get good deals on their rooms. The free parking and ease of check-in were about the only things that really mattered to me. I don't like that it's so high up on the strip, but for the price I suppose the brisk walk down to the middle is worth it.",3,5,1

My friend who joined us  last minute got much better prices that we did plus she got food and beverage credits.  The $20 resort fee seems like a way to make the room seem to be cheaper but its a manditory fee so why even play that game?  We were on a high floor and our room was nicer than those in our group who saved a few $$ by booking a lower floor.  The beds were comfortable, but we did have problems with the shower draining and the sink backing up.  They had to fix them twice. 

The pool was nice & we were able to arrange for a private cabana with a private pool for a fair price for our group, of course $17.00 cokes pool side seems beyond steep to me.  

The check in & check out process here is horrible...plan on waiting a long...long time and then don't plan on getting into your room right away  "" they are backed up & will call you when your room is ready""  about an hour or two after you check in.

The casino has a nice morning gaming class for those who want to learn craps, & roulette.  There late night dealers were lots of fun...one named Victoria was very helpful in teaching some of us how to lose our money slower..she was at the roulette table....from 11 p.m. lol As a result she made a higher percentage in tips from our group.  

Monte Carlo staff helped us get tickets to the LOVE show for a better price than the ""Half Price Tickets"" store.  No one had the tickets for 1\/2 price but we did get them for 40% off.  That show was the best part of our trip",3,0,2

That is a weird thing to mention in a review, but the bathroom door handle and tub faucet wasn't all the way attached and the tub dripped throughout our stay. The water pressure was insane. I'm pretty sure I lost a few layers of skin. 

The pool area is nice- enough space to find a patch of sun even when it was busy. Drink\/food service was pretty fast at the pool. 

Casino was nicer than I expected- pretty clean & good air quality. The café had good breakfast. 

I'm one of the last 10 people in my late 20's without one of those fancy internet phones, so I didn't mind not having wifi, but others in our party were slightly annoyed at this.

Room, is your typical. I don't think i need to review the room that much.

Monte Carlo is on a pretty good location on the strip (like another post said). It is accessible to Aria + Crystals + Bellagio (Aria Express Monorail) and the Strip is just right outside.  

THE GOOD:
The elevators on the Monte Carlo have a very interesting tune. Highly recommend paying attention to the music. Haha. 

Great Service - Monte Carlo is a classic, staff there are knowledgeable. 

$50 Credit at their food places - Including their Big Belly Buffet. Great for two people. :] 

I believe WiFi is accessible from floor 1-9 and the rest don't get WiFi. Not too sure.



THE BAD:

RESORT - sucks, its only a pool filled with people hogging it. $20 a night for the RESORT Fee. Workout room is crowded too.

Prime spot on the strip and most things were in walking distance.   Unfortunately, it was 100° plus every day while we were there, so we kept mostly to the indoors.

We stayed in the spa room on the 29th floor which was pretty nice.   The spa was a wide enough to have two people lay side by side with plenty of room still, and the view from there overlooked the strip for the best view I've ever had there.   Shower had a space between the glass door and glass wall so water was always squeezing between the two and wet the floor, so we had to have a couple towels there all the time. It had a steamer control but it's a wise idea to keep your feet far away from the tube that pours that out, as it's HOT!  Room safe faces you as you sit on the toilet and wasn't big enough for a laptop so that did us no good.  TV was an older tube with the volume blown, but who really comes to Las Vegas to watch TV?  

Bed had no comforter on it, but with controls for maintaining the room temperature, I guess it wasn't really needed.  We did get chocolate left on the pillow on the day we called for new linen from housekeeping which was cool.  And we got the wired internet (that's right, wired!) and two small bottles of water for the price of the resort fee which blows.  A copy of the USA today was available in the center of the hotel floor, but we kept waking up late and found the copies were always gone.  

The casino itself was somewhat on the quiet side, but like every other casino I've seen there lately, they had booty girls doing their dancing from 3pm until ?pm\/am.  I have to say also that this was one of the best smelling casinos except for the front of the Lance Burton Theatre, where it always seemed to have a strong fart smell.

Slots were very tight and unforgiving and the waitresses seemed few and far between - you could get super thirsty waiting for any to pass by.

Similar to the fate of the Luxor and New York, New York who once reigned in cleanliness and comfort but now have become grimy and less-than-impressive.  It's no wonder that the prices for rooms are going down.  This is not my first stay here but will more than likely be my last.  My room was a little beaten up with a shower head that rivals the ones installed at a Holiday Inn while the grout work was coming up and peeling.  The bed was okay but the sheets are now stiff and slightly uncomfortable.  I paid extra for a higher room only to be greeted by a view of the large construction across the street that awakened me every morning at 6:00 am.  Granted this is not MC's fault but it only added to the overall impression that this hotel has seen better days.

The Monte Carlo also does the now standard practice of adding a hefty daily ""resort fee"" that includes ""Monte Carlo water"" which is only two very small water bottles, wired internet (note, not wireless but wired, a very much out of date service) and access to the health spa.  But the last part is not completely accurate.  You do get to walk through the health spa but you don't get to partake in the showers, sauna rooms, pools, etc..  Those are for the folks who dish out an extra $15.  What you do get access to is the fitness center that, to be honest, is very decent with new equipment that is in excellent shape.  But it is disappointing that my resort fee doesn't actually cover all of the resort.

The staff is one of the saving graces: friendly, helpful, professional, and accommodating.  I had an issue with my iron where someone decided to iron the bottom of their shoe as it was caked with some kind of rubber coating, making ironing impossible.  I asked the maid a few doors down if she could help and within a few minutes she had a brand new iron for me!  That was excellent service and spoke well of the staff.

The walk to the middle of the strip is simple and not so far of a walk since you can walk to the tram in the Aria. 

The rooms weren't your greatest room, but they were decent. We decided to walk to Ross just to buy sheets since ours was stained and room service never picked up any of our calls. The bathroom had a few molds but that's in every other older hotels.

To Whom it May concern:

I'm unsure who to contact about my recent trip I booked through vegas.com, but unfortunately I attempted to settle a multitude of incidents at our stay at the Las Vegas Monte Carlo Resort & Hotel through their site management. None of which I feel were satisfactory. 
This was a trip that was meant to be memorable in the best of ways, yet the negative is what overpowered our experience by far. 
On the second night of our stay returning from dinner we are surprisingly greeted by small bugs on our hotel room ceiling, walls & bed!! We're disgusted & heartbroken because not only is this happening, but when we called to inform the front desk the response was not one of surprise, concern or genuine urgency at all! We were clear & explained we had very time precise plans we couldn't be late for. 
The lady assured us we would be moved out of our room within 5minutes by bell people & transferred into a new clean room. After waiting 15 minutes noone has shown up to our room to do anything promised. We called for status & were told to come get keys ourselves. We were forced to walk down to the bell desk & ask for lugguage help & keys for our new room. Wasting more time. Noone seemed to know what we talking about & all the bell people were scarce. At this point we are more than unpleased & frustrated with Monte Carlo's customer care. I got the room & shortly after a bell person came to ""help."" Ultimately, we missed our engagement which ruined our night. Noone apologized, expressed any kind of sympathy or compassion. Now its near 3am & were trying to settle in our new room when crickets jump out near our television. Seriously at this point our trip is sounding like a bad movie. I'm left feeling pathetic. 
 There's food & trash behind the tv stand. The lamp is broken, the bathroom shower head is very rusted & hard. The water spits all over your face & smells of strong chlorine & the faucet leaks all night!! I mean we never ever ever complain about anything, but this was a bit much for a vacation meant to be stress-free. Moved, to now our 3rd room. Same thing with front desk wait around games so this time we moved all our belongings ourselves. Noone checked on us again. No apologizes.
In desperate search for some kind of empathy or genuine understanding of our bad stay; I asked to speak to management. We met with Ricky. He seemed very helpful & promising. He explained the testing protocol of the tiny bugs...& kind of made us feel like we'd be equally compensated. Never happened. He said the bugs in both rooms were professionally tested. I found this to be very dishonest because in the midst of hurrying out our first room I must have forgotten a bag. I got the key at front desk to go back & there hadn't been  a single stir in the room. Bugs still residing, perhaps they did it later. 
All in all nothing was done beside a voicemail  ""confirmation"" that the bugs were not bed bugs or potentially worrisome. We also got a resort free discount. I handled myself both professionally & tactful which lacked in return from Monte Carlo. Not to mention I arrived home in Minnesota 7am without my lugguage due to it being shipped to Phoenix instead of Minneapolis. What is the proper protocol for this complaint? Hypothetically turning tables I know the small gesture MC gave me wouldn't be sufficient enough for even Ricky. I was told to contact who I booked through . I understand nothing can be perfect, but things can be properly cleaned, repaired, cared for & certainly addressed in a more acceptable manner. Especially one as popular & busy in Las Vegas. We didn't leave happy. Vegas.com can you help? If necessary I can attach pictures.

Yelp, I didnt include that I asked housekeeping for 2 extra towels and was told no. Said that I needed to  go to front desk for that even though her cart was fully stocked with cleaned wrapped towels. I said ""ok thank you"" 
I didn't include that who seemed to be the housekeeping supervisor knocked on my 3rd room thinking it was empty. I asked if he would like to check the room? ""No."" I expressed that I would LIKE him to. ""Thats ok.""
Now obviously one doesn't fly to Vegas to sit in a hotel room for 4 days so really does it matter about these things?  Yup! Sure does when your money is paying!!",4,0,0

I think if you go with the rightg mindset it's a great place.  Mindset being LOTS OF KIDS!  It has a great lazy river pool but that does draw families with kids.  The one and only time we took our teenager sons to Vegas we did stay there and it was appropriate but if you're a couple looking for a swanky and romantic place don't stay here. It does have a great food court and the rooms are adeqate.   It is centrally located so waking to lots of places is also great.,0,0,0

I know it's not the nicest or newest place, but the price is right & it's in a good location on the Strip. I've stayed before with no issues, but after this last trip I will NEVER stay there again.

I went to Vegas with my sister & one of my best girlfriends. We checked in late Friday night (11pm). We were in our room for about an hour so we could freshen up, regroup with friends & then we went downstairs to gamble & drink. We were out of our room for less than 4 hours. Somewhere in that time frame, all the cash we left in our purses in the room was stolen (a total of around $650). We noticed the next day when we woke up. 

We reported the theft to hotel management & security. We initially spoke to Ryan, position unknown, as he wasn't wearing a name tag. Ryan accessed their computer system which shows each time a door is opened by a guest or their staff. Long story short, the ""system"" shows that we did not close the door all the way when we left. There is no way this was possible. The door is so heavy it closes on its own. Their ""system"" also alerted them to this issue 10 mins after we left the room & security did nothing. Second manager named Celeste came over. They refused to comp our room and only offered a $100 credit towards food & drink. We demanded to move rooms and were told we were being upgraded to a suite. Upon entering the new room, we found it to be the same layout as our first room, just on a different floor. Julius, security personnel, wrote a report on a scratch piece of paper. My sister & I wrote statements. The police were never called. We were told this incident would be referred to Risk Management & they would follow up in 3-4 days after an ""investigation"". Over a week later and no word from the hotel. 

Upon my return back to work on Monday 8\/25\/14, my coworker asked about my trip. When I told her the story, she asked ""Wait, where did you stay?"" Turns out she stayed at the Monte Carlo in June with her sister & their boyfriends. Their boyfriends went to EDC & the girls didn't. My friend was sick & knocked out on cold medication, but her sister woke up in the middle of the night to find a man in their room. He said he was ""security"" and was checking a ""report"" of their door being left open. Super shady business going on at this place! 

DO NOT STAY HERE! If you must, use the safe AND deadbolt your door!! There are NO cameras in the hallway, so definitely stay at your own risk.",2,0,1

However I was not a fan of the towels in the bathrooms.

Now it should be noted my two kids are 21 & 24 so Vegas had a certain adult attraction. Also I was working the Black Hat conference and attending the DEFCON show so my stay would be two nights longer.

I'd booked my room several months in advance and received a good rate that averaged just over one hundred a night, before fees and taxes. Unfortunately, my original reservation was for a king room so I needed to switch it to a dual Queen, so I couldn't check-in online. On arrival the check-in line turned out to be 45 minutes long. When I finally got to the desk they assigned me a room with ""some minor"" construction noise that might start at 6 AM, and they said if it was a problem then they'd switch it tomorrow morning.

On arriving in the room it was plainly obvious it hadn't seen an update since it was originally constructed some 21 years earlier, the same year my son was born. Everything was seriously worn, and dated, but we were all exhausted from a full day hiking Zion, so we crashed. At 5:15 AM construction began with banging on I-beams, dump truck back up alarms, material being dropped, and all manner of construction noise. I then went back down to the service desk, next to check-in, where I waited another 30 minutes to talk with someone. Now I was told they didn't have any rooms at this point in the morning, but that they'd text me later in the morning when something came available.

They'd never called or texted me during the day with the room change. So on returning from a full day of Black Hat show set up and meetings I was compelled to spend another 30 minutes at 5 PM at the service desk waiting for some assistance. I'd politely asked for a more modern room on a higher floor away from the construction. I was offered a third-floor room facing the front entrance, still with 1996 appointments. My family quickly packed up and we moved from the sixth to the third floor. 

The room was identical down to the lack of outlets, pillows, and towels. We had to call every day for additional towels. The only difference was no 5:15 AM construction noise and a view of the front balcony roof.

While the hotel is under construction, from late 2016 through 2018, there is no pool or outdoors to speak of. Did I mention the $35\/day non-negotiable ""Resort"" fee? This entitles you to a bus ride to another MGM property to use their pool. Oh, and the buses sometimes depart early so plan ahead. My family made use of this exactly once, so $210 for three people, $70\/each or $35\/hour\/person to use a pool. Oh, I forgot to mention the resort fee also includes Wifi in the room.

I'd mark the casino as one of the most run-down ones in a major hotel on the strip. While the restaurants were on par. In the prior two years, I've stayed at both Mandalay Bay and the Venetian, and had meals and gambled at Bellagio, Ceasar's, Paris, and have even gone down town to the historic Golden Nugget and Binions for dining and gambling. So I have a fairly good grasp of what the town has to offer.

Personally, I'm never returning to this hotel. My nightly room rate, before taxes and resort fees, tripled from Monday night to Saturday night. This is nothing new, many hotels now use this surge pricing practice. If this was the Venetian I wouldn't mind paying more for something nice, but this hotel room could have easily been an old Courtyard property in some backwater town. It was far from something special.

This was my last ever stay at the Monte Carlo never again. It's just not worth it!",0,0,0

No mini fridge to keep anything in. Friday morning we were awaken at 7 to sound of really loud construction noise. Sat morning was awaken at 7 again to loud construction crane noise. Upon checkout we were charged resort fee!  For what?  No pool. No spa. What would the resort fee be for?  Were told could go to MGM to use their spa and pool. Really!  Walk all the way through the Monte Carlo, go outside, walk down the several several blocks, cross over the bridge, walk all the way through the MGM just to use the spa.  What a joke.

In town for my brother's wedding, it was decided ahead of time that we were all staying at the Monte Carlo.

I would have preferred to spend a bit more $ to stay at a nicer hotel, but it would have been rude to stray from the group.

The rooms were not half bad. Clean, spacious, and a comfortable bed. Pretty much all I'm looking for in a hotel when I'm only staying for a short time.

The staff was friendly, especially the doormen and housekeepers. I bribed the housekeeper $10 to give me extra shampoos, etc.,  as I donate them to a shelter, and she brought me a gigantic bag of stuff.

I think the dining choices could be better. I didn't try every place, but the one place I did try still haunts me.

Internet access will run you $14.99 per 24 hours, which I think is a bit steep. I guess with so many business travelers, they can get away with gouging you.

She literally waited for the locksmith to come up and when it took too long, upgraded our room so we could go in rather than wait in the hallway with our bags. She made sure we had a new room, showed us how everything worked, and asked us if we needed anything else before she left. The first checkin staff did not let us speak with a manager, and when we did speak with a manager, he was very arrogant and did not give a solution. When we tried calling the concierge line it was closed. When we got to our first room, there was a pile of trash sitting outside our door. When housekeeping came to pick it up, their response was ""that's it?"". I personally don't think any trash should be left outside of a room.

After a long conversation about all our troubles, he said he would waive our resort fees, but when we checked out, those fees were still on our bill.

It appears that it's received one.  Not sure about the regular rooms but the junior suite I had was fantastic for the price.  It's about 700 SQ Ft and I enjoyed the extra space in the lounge area and the second bathroom.

Most important they have improved the beds or the beddings.  The bed was almost as comfortable as a Westin Heavenly bed.

The front of the MC was fairly bland and restaurant options limited.  They've made big strides with the addition of Diablo.  The Pub has been one of my Strip faves for years and it's still a good option, especially for game day, but it's not quite the value that it used to be.  

The pool area is much nicer too with the addition of sand volleyball and the wave pool.  The downside to the pool though is that the sun is limited by all the surrounding buildings.  The area in the middle gets sun most of the day but most of the areas have a 4 hour window depending on the time of the day.  

I'm going to give the MC kudos for stepping up its game and making major improvements.  My one complaint is that they charge premium prices on food & beverage for a non premium hotel.  The MC is in the middle or low end for the MGM franchise and its pool doesn't warrant $14 cocktails.  

I will compliment the casino for not jacking it's minimums, even on weekend nights you can still find $10 BJ.  Avoid the tables near the front with the Go-Go dancers due to the poor odds.  6-5 BJ rather than 3-2 and no surrender.",1,0,0

The room was nothing to sing songs about. I was ignored when I asked if there was any room available that was at a higher floor & maybe with a bit of a view (I don't expect strip views and hot tub, but I do expect a little bit of effort when someone asks for anything... especially when paying Vegas strip rices). They proceeded to simply give me what come up on their computers, with no efforts in looking for availability for something a bit better. OK, fine. OK, now I'm in my room. There is no wifi at all (because the room is far from everything... the wifi literally doesn't reach). I am right above the air conditioning units, over the parking lot area, in the very back back of the hotel.  Since the room is hidden away at the very back, and at the lowest floor possible, I only get EDGE service on my phone (which is good for pretty much nothing, not even phone calls), so i'm not only possibly the worst room at Monte Carlo, I'm also unable to chill in bed on the web, in between my escapades on the Strip.  I found an old\/used\/dried up coffee package in the coffee machine in the morning... it hadn't been cleaned. There was no hair drier (isn't this a standard even for a non-baller room??). Needless to say, the room was not good. It served it's purpose, which is to give me a place to sleep with a nice king sized bed, but that's all. For the price? I would not stay there again.

2. They charge a daily resort fee

4. The casino area isn't too smokey like other hotels I've walked through

Monte Carlo is about as mediocre a place as you can get.  I really see now why a lot of reviewers give it the 3-star.  There was really nothing wrong with it, but if you're going to Vegas, why not find a place that has some personality?  Everything that's good about Monte, some other place definitely does better.  Here we go:

Room:  Plain, clean, functional.  Bed was not the most comfy, TV was weak (OK, so no one watched TV anyway), and the bathroom was standard.  Better rooms almost anywhere for the same price.  Non-strip view of the NYNY wasn't really that bad.  AC was ice-cold.

Casino:  Boooooring.  This was probably the worst part.  Standard games, dealers were on the quiet side (one craps dealer, Robert, was TERRIBLE but another guy offset him).  Players' card (MGM Grand) is good for a lot of other casinos.  Better casino's at Mirage, NYNY, MGM Grand, Flamingo, or some of the low-roller joints.

Pool:  Very good.  Lazy river was cool, cabana service was great.  DJ kept it loud, with enough Britney and Lady Gaga to go around.  The crowd, however, is a bit on the middle-aged side.  Felt like a topless hot tub with all the male boobs hanging out.  I didn't really notice until after going to Hard Rock for ""Relax"" but now YOU will.  Mirage, Flamingo, Palms, and Hard Rock all do it much better.

Buffet:  Surprisingly GOOD!  Lot of selection, taco bar, roast meats, sushi, etc.  Did not have fresh seafood, though.  

Service:  About as unnoticable as possible.  This is a good thing, but sometimes I just want a little low-roller attention.  Housekeeping forgot extra soap 2 days in a row.  Front desk was good, they knocked off the wi-fi that my buddy used by mistake.  Didn't use concierge.

Can't say yes or no here.  I'd rather head back to Flamingo anytime for the same price.  Also not a big fan of the South Strip, as I prefer the next few blocks up...  Skip the Monte.",1,2,1

Price was not bad I booked my room a day in advanced and it was a 1 master bedroom for $70 not bad at all... You have the famous Diablos Cantina under you and it's also so close to the strip so you have pretty much everything close by! That's a plus! Also I recommend you book your stay ahead of time they have a separate line for people who are checking in and it goes by faster... They also always have early check in available so you can get up to your room before 3. Not always guaranteed tho but all 3 times that I have stayed there we were able to do an early check in... Housekeepers are also very nice and they do a good job of cleaning up your room they are not always knocking on your door like other places and annoying you lol. Although this last time that I stayed at Monte Carlo they are doing construction so be prepared for that.. Construction workers start drilling and doing what they gotta do at 7ish I personally DID NOT mind at all but if you are a light sleeper and you wish to get your sleep you will find this very annoying @ 7am so just don't stay here until there construction is FULLY complete.

My friends and I planned this trip and booked the hotel about 9 months in advance. We chose the hotel based on its convenient location about midway between the start and finish lines of the race.

At the time we booked the hotel we had no idea it would be under construction during our visit. We never received any advance warning of this fact. It was actually just a few days prior to our trip when I was looking at Las Vegas travel forums online that I saw a post about the construction and what a headache it was. At that point it was too late for us to find alternate accommodations, so we kept with our original plan.

When we arrived the employee at the check-in counter didn't mention the renovations at all. He did ask if we would like a ""quieter"" higher floor room for a $5 upcharge. We said yes to this, thinking that we would avoid construction noise. 

During check-in we were told about the resort fee, which is approx. $30 per day in addition to the room rate (we had already pre-paid the room) so they put a hold on my friend's card for the resort fee plus $5 high-floor, plus an ""extra"" hold. Kind of standard, and we didn't say anything about it. 

I think my biggest disappointment of this trip was the pool being closed. I had heard they had a nice lazy river and really just had my heart set on relaxing by the pool. We started to wonder what our resort fee was good for since the pool was closed, so the next day we went down to the lobby to find out what our other options were. The employee at the desk this time gave us what sounded like a canned response that the resort fee covered ""wifi, complimentary newspaper, boarding pass printing, and access to the spa and gym"". My friend who had booked the room tried to see if they would reduce the resort fee based on the reduced resort offerings but he wouldn't budge on it. 

To be clear, the wifi at this hotel is open to anyone that walks in, there's no password or need to enter your room number. We never saw a complimentary newspaper during our hotel stay, and we didn't need to print our boarding passes. So, we decided to check out the one remaining amenity, the spa. 

When we stopped in the spa we were informed that if we wanted to use the spa whirlpool we would have to pay an additional $25 for a spa pass. Seriously??? After we're already paying $30\/day in resort fees? That was nuts. She said the normal rate is $35 for the spa pass and as guests we get a discount. That was the stupidest thing I've ever heard. (And while I would have LOVED to visit the spa prior to the race, there was no way I was going to pay extra for it.)

So, long story short, if this hotel staff was compassionate in any way they could have given us a spa voucher or something to make us happy guests. But they didn't seem to care. 

Truly, we didn't have a horrible stay here. The room was nice, the beds were comfortable, and the housekeeping staff did a great job supplying extra towels and pillows when we asked. I just don't feel like we got what we paid for with the resort fee.

Bonus: Ongoing headaches with the hotel after our stay as my friend still hasn't had the hold on her credit card released two weeks later...",4,1,1

The rooms were nice we even got some what of an upgrade to have a strip view. The only thing I have a complaint about was a bartender down stairs at one of their bars. I don't remember the name of it but the old man there was very rude and made it so hard for us girls to get drinks and just gave us major attitude. Other than that the stay was great. Oh yeah the pool was closed down due to remodeling which kinda sucked but they gave you the option to go to any other MGM casino.,0,0,0

The rooms are overpriced for a weekend stay - had I noticed I was paying $250 a night to stay here, I would've picked anywhere else.  They are currently doing construction, so if you are planning on sleeping past 9AM, don't stay here.  Also, the walls and doors are paper thin.  We could hear everyone walking past our room in the hallway even if they weren't being loud.  We could hear doors closing of any room near us, and also we could hear rooms near us as well.  

None of the rooms come with any fridges (you have to pay $25 a night), no microwaves, and the room we had was lacking in USB ports and electrical outlets - overall the room we stayed in was outdated.

Also if you want a pool at the hotel, don't stay here - because as of the time of this review, they have no pool.  You can use the pool at Mandalay Bay or MGM Grand, both of which are a 20-30 minute walk away.  We used the MGM Grand pool and I was severely impressed - it's a pretty nice setup.  They have several pools and a lazy river.  Mandalay Bay is rated as a ""Top Pool"" but we just didn't want to walk that far away.

The hotel Staff is pretty good and nice, but it doesn't make up for the crappiness of the hotel.  The first room I was checked into (which btw, took me an hour to check into), was so bad I made them switch me into another room - and I have NEVER done that before.  The bathroom was so utterly disgusting and run down, there was no way I was staying in that room.  Only two of the four spickets for the shower head worked, and the rest of the time the water just dripped down.  

The Casino floor is okay, but they are missing some of my favorite games (like Big Bang Theory and a different Hangover game), so I can't rate it very high.  The best thing about this place, is that there's a food court with a Subway, Sbarro, Starbucks, Nathan's, Chinese\/Mexican and one other place I can't remember the name of that was very great to have when stumbling drunk back to my hotel room at 2AM.  They also have an Ice Bar here, as well as another bar that generally is advertising a $4 draft special all day.  

The location of the hotel is also pretty good.  NYNY and T-Mobile Arena is right across the street, where as a tram ride will take you to Vdara\/Aria\/Cosmo\/Bellagio.  From Bellagio you can pretty much get anywhere else on the other side of the strip.

However, after saying all that, I will not be staying here again until the renovation is complete, if even then.  If I'm paying $250 a night for a room, that room better come with all the sparks and whistles.",3,0,0

NOTHING!

The hubs and I flew our happy ass's to Vegas for the weekend and decided to forgo our normal stay at Excalibur (let's face it, it's cheap AF) and opted for a little more class - so to the Monte Carlo we went! Here are the takeaways:

STAFF: Super friendly, but ridiculously understaffed. We checked in on a Friday night, stood in a line wrapping around the entire lobby to check in! A mere four people manned the front desk and the online check in kiosks were off. Thankfully - after about 30 minutes in line we were greeted and welcomed to Las Vegas! Originally we had booked a strip room view, and were offered a ""free"" upgrade to a nicer room on a higher floor. I made sure to ask the attendant if there was an additional charge, she said ""no, on us!"". Until we saw the bill - which had an up charge of $35. Other than that, staff was friendly, accommodating, and made sure our room was cleaned each day!

ROOMS: Our suite was spacious featured a large king bed, window overlooking the Aria and 2 bathrooms - which is more than i have in my apartment! The space was arranged nicely with a large couch, bar area and a little dining area - which totally made the space! Although it had some dust, it wasn't a big deal :)

PRICES\/LOCATION\/VIBE: For 3 nights it wasn't too bad on our wallet and cost us just around $450. The location is perfection, as it's not quite at the end of the strip, but more in the middle - which makes it easier to walk to various casinos and restaurants! Because it's located next to New York, New York - there are plenty of options available!! Vibe is relaxed, yet fun. Everyone here seemed to be enjoying themselves! Not too bad for Vegas!

**Pro Tip: A food court is located in the back of the casino, making grab and go meals - easy peasy!",2,0,1

People walking and talking in the hallway are easily heard. The tour helicopters flying down the strip are easily heard through the windows. No wifi in the rooms only an old school wired internet cable. No refrigerator. The electrical outlets were either missing the plastic cover (behind the nightstand) or felt loose when pulling the plug out of the outlet. Seemed like a possible safety hazard to me.

We check into the hotel at 5:30 PM we have dinner reservations for 8:00 so we are in a hurry to get ready and rush out the door. While getting ready I keep getting whiffs of a urine smell, but can't figure out where it's coming from. I hurry up and get ready and leave for the night, not returning until very late. By this time we go to sleep and when I wake up in the morning, again I keep getting smells of urine. 

I start smelling all over the bed sheets and on the very bottom of the sheet where it was tucked in from the bed having been made is a spot of urine. I assumed that it was just the sheet at this point and asked for them to change the sheets and asked (why I needed to ask and it was not offered is beyond me) at that time for some sort of compensation as this is absolutely unacceptable. They offer a $50 food and beverage credit. I told them I do not want the credit, I would like some compensation off the reservation total. However, I was told that since we booked through Tingo that they are unable to process this. I felt like I had no choice but to just accept it. We didn't want to change rooms at this point since we had unpacked all of our things and were all settled in. They come and change the sheets and everything was fine. I was at this point satisfied. 

Until I bend down and keep smelling urine, my friend sits down on the floor to put her shoes on and she smells it as well. We start smelling around the entire room and find that there are multiple areas that smell of urine. It seemed like someone had snuck a dog into the room and it marked it's scent everywhere. At this point we ask to change rooms, and I am beyond disgusted. 

I am forced to go down and speak to a manager and explain the situation and request AGAIN for some sort of compensation off of the room fee. Again, I am told that because I booked through Tingo that they're unable to do anything. I felt as though I was being penalized for booking through a third party service. Why would you allow your hotel to be booked through it if you don't intend on providing the same service compared to if I were to book directly through the hotel. 

I spoke to one last manager when we checked out and she was the worst of them all. Not only was she rude and condescending she made me feel as though I were being unreasonable. If you were to book a hotel and it was filled with the scent of urine would you be happy? The manager then proceeds to tell me that going through Tingo is the ONLY way to get my money back. 

So, I call Tingo and they tell me the opposite, that going through the hotel is the only way to get my money back and that they tried to contact the Monte Carlo and they are refusing to do so. So between the two companies I keep getting pushed around and bounced back and forth and neither are willing to assist in anyway. I cannot explain how frustrated I am, it is not about the money it is about the principle of the matter. 

Bottomline: 
1. Don't ever book through Tingo, and be weary of booking through third party services as the hotels seem to act like they are unable to assist you when you do.
2. Don't ever give the Monte Carlo any business. They clearly lack in cleanliness and any respect for their hotel and their customers
3. I am in the serve industry and I understand that yelling and screaming will not get you anywhere which is why I kept calm and was very reasonable throughout this entire process. Maybe if I would have raised my voice someone would have listened. 

I'm a LOCAL from Vegas have been since I was 7 years old. I've worked in numerous properties on the strip and never in my life have I experienced this level of dissatisfaction.

The service was good ,we liked the value of the hotel for being on the strip, we had a good time at the pool and we liked that we didn't have to walk across a hotel to get to self park, the valet or to get a cab (everything was laid out well)

So when we decided to celebrate our 3 year anniversary, we thought why not return? We initially got a handicap room because they had no other room available. We were told that the room was exactly the same except there were rails around the shower and toilet. The rails did not bother us but the room was gross. The carpet was filthy, there was a blood stain on our comforter, which smelled like a dirty gym (GROSS). There was a blood stain on one of the towels in the bathroom (DOUBLE GROSS), and the other towel had light brown stains and a hole in the middle of it (WTF). So we called down to have our room changed but they couldn't move us until the next day so FINE, we toughed it out for the night and tried to touch very little. 

The next morning my girlfriend (now fiance) actually proposed in the room. So the moment was extremely memorable because she made it extremely personal and sweet BUT what I found out afterwards really upset me. She told me how she called the concierge ahead of time and was trying to arrange a special room service breakfast (heart shaped pancakes and what not) and the guy just shut her down and said we don't do that. He didn't offer any alternatives or even give any suggestions. Now she prefaced the request with, I am proposing. I get that they have limitations but seriously?? You could not do a cheesy heart pancake? Obviously, the moment was perfect as is and I said yes, but to just shut someone down and not offer an alternative is ridiculous. She ended up even ordering the flowers from an outside flower shop because the hotel was ridiculously unhelpful. 

They moved us up to the 29th floor the next day and the room, towels and sheets were much better and the next two nights went off without incident. 

Between the beyond gross room and the completely unhelpful concierge, we won't be revisiting the Monte Carlo.",5,0,0

While I'm only staying in the hotel for the night. I can't help but wonder why everything in my room seems to be broken... okay, not everything is broken, but it might as well be. When I first got into the hotel, it looked nice and I thought it'd be more of an upgraded compared to the Planet Hollywood - but I was wrong. Once the doors opened to my floor, I realized that this hotel is rundown. The walls and doors look dirty and the border is bent and coming off, but hey, it's only the outside so I won't complain too much. While the room doesn't have any bad odors, it did have old gum on the carpet - which was a bit gross. When I went into the bathroom we discovered the little mirror was actually broken so if it was touched it, it would fall off and possibly shatter.
After walking the strip, later that night, I tried to turn on the lamp between the two beds and the button was broken - at least they had two more in the room, otherwise, the room would be pretty dark. When we turned on the TV, the remote was having issues and would not change the station. It just seems like this hotel is a bit of a mess at moment, which is disappointing, because I excepted so much more...

Also, skip the Buffet, tastes like a frozen TV dinner, definitely not worth it - even if you get one of the meals for free. We found plastic on the pizza too.",0,0,0

She said to hold on to our voucher and the valet parking would be comped.  That was awesome. 
We get up to our room, nothing special about it.  Definitely needs some remodeling. Was very disappointed that we didn't have at least a coffee maker in our room. Nothing else was in our room, like a menu for room service, or what amenities the the hotel has. We stayed for 5 days.

My husband called at 8:30 pm for our room to be cleaned as we were leaving to go have dinner.  
The next day we were leaving, and I received a email to review our final bill and check out.  The bill was for $26.00 for valet parking.  So we went down to the desk and told them we were told the valet parking was going to be comped. The lady was very rude and said no its not, who would tell you that. We explained it was told to us upon check in. She just said no, I'm afraid not. I was already pissed and just paid the money to get out of this place. We go to leave and scan our ticket for valet to bring our car, and the machine says we owe $26.00. So even more upset by this time, go to the valet booth and talk to someone, show her we paid the $26.00 at check out. She tells us, we only paid half, it's the balance and would not give us our car unless we paid it. So this just made our stay here worse. Paid $52.00 for something we were told was comped, unreal.

I thought the room was good sized and clean. As long as a room in Vegas is clean, doesnt smell, has a bed and a shower I'm all good. What do you really use your room in Vegas for anyways? Just to sleep and get ready. 

I really enjoyed the pool area, I was concerned at first that it would be a little lame because of the city center blocking the sun and it being an older hotel there wouldn't be any good music to make it like a party atmosphere. But the city center had no impact on my experience and the pool had a DJ there that played good music all day. Loved the lazy river, definitely provided a lot of laughs for me and my friends. 

I would've given the Monte Carlo 5 stars but I was super disappointed in the gaming area. It just seemed so dead. Although from what I've been reading this is possibly a result of this recession our country is going thru.

What kind of a hotel has a pool area that closes at 6 PM, and has only one hot tub for a pool area that has a capacity of many, many hundreds? Sure, Las Vegas gets hot... from May through August. The rest of the year (as when I was there, in April), I want to use the dang hot tub and not cuddle with the scary man in the Speedo next to me.

6 PM. What a total joke. I'm sure you want me on the casino floor, but sometimes, I just want to sit in the pool or the hot tub. Jeez.

We booked a room with a king bed, got up there to find two queens. After an eight-hour drive down, too exhausted to wait in that stupid line again to get it fixed, so we spent our anniversary getaway in separate beds. Awesome.

No wifi? $20 daily hotel fee (thinly veiled Internet charge)? Boo. Boo boo boo.

Toilets flush like airplane toilets but even more noisily and ferociously. Shouldn't weird me out, but it did.

Water got hot fast. That was nice. Shower heads were low, though.

They don't use covers on their comforters, just a sheet on top and bottom, so of course that doesn't stay more than one night. Annoying.

The rooms were clean, bland but clean. The a\/c worked fine since it was 118 outside the 3 days I was there. I was lucky and got one of the bath tubs that drained right. My brother from South Carolina was in another room on the same floor and his drained really slow.
Overall it is a nice place and is a lot less for other comparable places. When you park, using the valet is a must. They are building a new convention center next door and the construction people are using the parking garage. They have Monte Carlo & the New York New York next door sharing the same garage. There is a small lot at street level but it is hard to find a spot in there. If you park valet, you don't have to worry about it. (I mean a $5 tip when they bring you your car that has been sitting in a covered garage is worth the money.
If you sign up for the players club you can charge meals, drinks and whatever else at 7 or 8 different hotels on the strip. It makes it so you don't have to carry that much cash with you when you go out.

The dickhead that was working at Subway stopped helping his customer long enough to yell at me 20 feet away. ""That's for customers only, don't take that."" I went over, stood in line and asked him how much for a cup of ice for my 11 month old son. He said, ""we don't sell ice. You need to pay full price for the beverage. Beverages are for customers only."" I showed him my Starbucks cup and pointed to my wife's Mc D's. I told him we had the remains of 2 subs from his Subway up in the room. All I wanted was a cup of ice for my son. He said I needed to by something. I gave him $3 for a large soda and went to fill up the plastic cup I bought from them the previous night. I went back over and said, ""Thank you for going out of your way and being a total douche to me. I really appreciate that you felt the need to yell at me from 20 feet away and try and embarrass me.

My last important suggestion if you are dumb enough to stay here.

It is a basic no frills hotel.  Nothing fancy, but be honest who spends the majority of their time in a hotel room while in Vegas?! 

Areas that could be improved upon; wiping down the surface areas (had finger prints on the bathroom door); since when did hotels not have a coffee maker after a night out most need a caffeine pick me up, given our technology driven ways charging stations on the night stand would be helpful and when walking into the casino from the strip sometimes guests were hit with an unpleasant smell. 

The positive spots: Checking in & out was a breeze, got my tickets to the show, had a little snafu w\/ the tickets, concierge desk was closed & Mary at the front desk provided guidance that ultimately got my issue resolved.  Location provides easy access to all things Vegas. The minus 5 bar is located in the casino and is a cool experience :)  Diablo's Cantina is also located there and good place to meet friends for drinks and food.

   We were also disappointed because they don't have or no longer have their own brewery, which we were looking forward to.  To me, it's just another fancy looking hotel that is overcharging customers and not taking care of their needs and complaints in a proper and professional manner; I waited months for them to tell me that they did an investigation and found they were not responsible for frying my phone.  They didn't even want phone records to prove my phone was working the day I got there and that I wasn't using it for days after it got fried.  
   We also spent hundreds gambling and didn't have ""any luck"" whatsoever.  Overall, a disappointing and extremely expensive New Year's Eve in Las Vegas!!!  Don't ever plan on going back!!!

I have been in a few times and always enjoyed it's layout and variety of activities available. I was pretty thrilled to be staying here this time because I thought the rooms would have to be amazing.  Nope. 

Now, our room could be a 'one off', but I doubt it.  It was apparent that housekeeping takes no detail in their cleaning. There were dried up French fries under the TV stand. iPhone plugs left in the walls by previous guests. I was afraid to 'look' for anything else. 

The beds were very comfortable. I really should've checked for bed bugs, but I didn't.  By the time we went to bed, I was just beat. But the blanket that they cover up with a sheet looks like it had not been washed in a month. There were fresh food stains on it, some daquari, just gross. 

Now the bathroom is where it got real nasty. The shower is LINED in mold!  MOLD!  Black\/green mold along the caulk, and a real nice thick pile of nasty yellow mold in the grout. I thought maybe it was a sealant, so I took a towel to it.  Nope. Gross. 

The door knobs had dirty thick finger prints around them, so you know it hasn't been wiped.

The sad thing is that this is usually all found out the next morning. I know when we got to our room, we dropped our bags took a quick (slightly disappointed) look and left the room for the night. I didn't think I needed to pull out white gloves and a black light at a 4-star hotel.

I asked for two clean sheets and two blankets and all they brought up was one blanket and the guy was rude. And don't expect enthusiastic dealers.

If we weren't on a roadtrip just passing through for the night with a 19 month old, I would have taken the time to actually vent to the hotel management.  For one of the best suites at this hotel, the experience was terrible:

-Website claims ""these outstanding rooms all feature glittering views""-Not true.  I saw the side of Aria and a smidge of a sign on the strip.

-Valet took 20 minutes to greet us\/get to our car upon check-in.  No option to leave keys and go.

-Asked an employee in the lobby if I could check in under the M Life line ""for M life Gold & Platinum members and suite guests.""  I was a top tier suite guest, but not gold\/platinum, seemed like a legit question considering Bellagio and other nice hotels have a separate line if you book a nicer room. Employee told me he had no idea, but I could always try standing in the line to ""see what they say.""   

-Upon arriving to room, found a sack full of half eaten candy in one of the wet bar cabinets

-Some nice pubic hair found in the Jacuzzi tub

-Mold along the entire base lining\/caulk in the shower.  Not just dots of black\/green, it was completely covered.

-Upon check-out, you can't even call valet to bring your car around.  You have to hand them your ticket in person.  What's the point?

-No room service if you want to order food-unless its breakfast

-Luckily the room was big enough to have two phones.  One didn't work, and the other one only one of the speed dial buttons to various departments of the hotel even worked.

I've stayed in Vegas five or six times and always like to splurge for a nice suite at a different hotel on most occasions.  I know how they treat you at other hotels on the strip, especially when you book an expensive suite and they don't go out of their way one bit at Monte Carlo.",1,0,0

The Monte Carlo fit the bill on all accounts.  I was a bit nervous on the way there from reading different reviews but once we arrived, I knew that for us, we'd made the right choice.

Check-in was quick and pleasant.  We arrived at 11am on a Thursday and were directed straight away to our rooms even though check-in was not until 3pm!  Pow!  We were a group of 6, so we had two rooms.  The front desk clerk suggested adjoining rooms which was excellent and really added a lot of fun to our stay.  The rooms were very clean with very comfortable beds, 42-inch plasmas and the a\/c worked fine.

My favorite parts about the MC are the in-house casino (OF COURSE) and the number of drinking\/dining options available right on the first floor.  There's a buffet (you can buy an all day\/all meals pass for $38 w\/ tax+fees), a food court (McD's, Subway, Sbarro's, Haagen Daaz, etc.), and then various restaurants and bars (The Pub, Minus 5 Bar, Andre's, Diablo Cantina, etc).  The buffet was decent enough for the price.

If you want a hotel where you can just about have the whole Las Vegas experience without ever leaving the building, MC is for you!  That wasn't our aim, so we did do a LOT of sight-seeing and traveling The Strip.  In that aspect, the proximity of the Monte Carlo to other attractions\/hotels on the strip was perfect for us.  What we couldn't get to on foot, the bus route took us directly there.

In addition to being clean, Monte Carlo is more than comfortable and it's a fun place to stay.  There are more than a few discounts available to go here at a great price.  I LOVED staying at the Monte Carlo and it will remain at the top of my list for my next trip to Las Vegas!",7,2,1

First of all the pool is under construction, besides the inconvenience that you have to go to other hotels to lay in the sun, the construction workers work during the night till daylight. You can hear loud Cranes and heavy machinery. 
As that wasn't enough, apparently they are remodeling some rooms, and during the day they are working on those. The construction inside the hotel starts at 7am and they are working all day till 5pm,(you hear loud jackhammers coming from the ceiling, as they work on the room above), we couldn't sleep for our whole stay.  
As of the customer service, we went and kindly asked to get a different room where there wasn't any construction above, the person helping us was very rude telling us that it was posted on their website about the construction( on the website it was only posted about the pool being under construction, NOTHING about the construction in the rooms next door or on the above floor) 
After insisting,she told us to wait and somebody will call us shortly with another room number to switch from the current one. 2 days later and nobody called us. We are still waiting.

For one, this hotel is generally rated as a four-star resort, which clearly raises expectations to a point that the Monte Carlo is never quite able to meet.  It'd be overly harsh to say that I hated my stay here (because I didn't), but there were many many things that could have been handled better.

Upon checking in, the credit card used to pay for the room was immediately hit with a mystery $543 charge (the room for three nights was supposed to be only $370, and the first night had already been paid).  After calling around for awhile, we were told that the hotel takes a $150 refundable deposit and a $20\/day resort fee, neither of which were disclosed to any of us.  The $20\/day resort fee was not too much of a surprise, but we left confused as to what the charge was actually for, since other hotels have used this fee to ""pay"" for Wi-Fi access, HD service, etc., and Monte Carlo provided none of this (not to mention piss poor cell phone service).  All in all, the stay set us back about $500, which was quite a bit more than the agreed price of $370.

We got the cheaper room, so we weren't facing The Strip, but instead, got a view of the pool.  This was not a bad thing considering that we came during their Spring Break festivities.  Speaking of the pool, it was one of the bigger pool areas I've seen, complete with lazy river, wave pool, hot tub, and sand volleyball court (this was by far the best part).  Facilities were surprisingly good, but they were somewhat tainted by the presence of Jersey Shore wannabes.

Casino was pretty standard among those on The Strip, but equipped with a number of bar dancers towards the entrance, which was a nice touch.  Sports book was small, but then again, this wasn't a huge surprise, since no one goes to the Monte Carlo to place bets.

It wasn't the worst hotel I've ever stayed at, but I can say that I don't foresee coming back to this hotel with so many other legitimate 4-star resorts on the Strip at comparable prices.",0,0,0

Being one of the MLife resorts, it's a great strip-central location and easy access to Aria and Bellagio resorts by way of tram or short walk. This may be one of the older hotels but still a nice stay for the money. 

The suites are clean and basic. Didn't get to try the more luxury rooms, but was satisfied with the mountain view room I got. 

Food: Many options from the budget food court area to more fancy upscale dining. I've dined at Brand in the past and enjoyed their menu and service. Highly recommend the meat entrées. 

Casino area is what you expect. Tables and slots galore, pick a denomination and play your heart and wallet out. A few bars to grab a drink as well.

Entertainment: This resort has a good variety to check out. I didn't get to see the live bands in the bars or restaurants but did see Blue Man group a couple years ago and it was good. A bit slow and the music a little repetitive sometimes, but overall a nice show to see at least once. Some cool audience participation and interaction as well.

We arrived in the evening and didn't find a line at the check-in desk.  The clerk who helped us was friendly but appeared to be new since he needed assistance from another clerk.  No problem.  Finding the elevator to get to our room was easy. When we entered the room, it was spacious with two comfortable beds.  The bathroom was okay.  One think I did notice though, unlike most other hotels where you would find a clock.....there was none.  I had to keep checking my cell phone for the time.  We headed down to the MLife desk to redeem a comp for two buffets.  Luckily, the courtesy clerk was nice enough to explain that if we didn't use the comp for that night, we'd lose it.  We took her advice and used it for another night, when we had more time. We instead redeemed another comp for a free pint of beet at The Pub. After venturing out for a couple of hours, we returned to the hotel and headed straight for the food court.  Glad they have one. We slept pretty good but like most other hotels, you do hear people next door or out in the hallways.  When it was time to check out the next day, instead of going back to the front desk, I found the express check-out box close by.  There was a computer on top of it for guests to print out their receipts.  I only wanted to drop the room keys in.  A guest was taking her time at the express check-out box.  Maybe, they can just leave the box by itself so guests can just drop their keys in without waiting.  We left our bags with at the bell desk since we were going to check out the surrounding areas.

Based on the interior of the casino and the price of its restaurants, they want you to believe the hotel is fancier than it actually is. The only real kudos I can give the Monte Carlo is its location on the strip, proximity to other casinos, and their fitness center (see below).

The room was ok. No luxury, just the nuts and bolts of a standard room. The Monte Carlo offers very cheap deals during weekdays, but note they do charge a MANDATORY resort fee daily. I believe the fee is about $15 and includes high speed internet (but not wi fi...crazy!!!!!) and access to the gym (but not the spa). These were the only two amenities I used during the visit. I had my laptop and had to use a plug-in cord, which did not work very well. The Internet kept cutting in and out...very annoying. The gym was a pleasant surprise; it had nice equipment and it was not overly crowded. 

Would I stay here again? Probably not, in a town that prides itself on exceptional hotel quality (ie, the Palazzo), I will continue looking for deals and pay a little more to stay at nicer hotels.

The casino floor is huge and easy to get lost in. A lot of the dealers are quite friendly, talkative and outgoing if you chat with them while they deal. Plenty of great restaurants to eat at. I finished $6,000 up playing their roulette tables! 

Huge con though is they don't allow outside drinks in their pool, quite disappointing.

By the pictures I saw on the website I thought it was a nice hotel with a beautiful clean room! Annnnt WRONG!
1. The carpet is filthy and disgusting. This carpet looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. You can literally seen the dirt on the carpet and spots.
2. The bathroom floor was very nasty and dirty and so was the toilet. They switched our and room and the 2nd room was an F instead of an F-.
3. The 2nd room carpet was just a filthy. I had to keep my shoes on and it really scared me to sleep in their beds. 
4. The tub was stopped up after I took a shower. They had to send someone up to run a snake to clear the drainage. 
5. The bell serviceman was HORRIBLE! When we arrived to check our luggage with the bell desk we were not greeted and the Bellman by the name of 'Warren"" just stood there and then proceeded to help someone whom had just walked up after us.

The weekend we happened to be visiting played host to not only the Pacquiao versus Bradley fight (and controversial upset), but also a big series between the Celtics and Heat, the third leg of the Triple Crown races, and most significant to us locally, the Electric Daisy Carnival, which boasted nearly 350,000 attendees over a 3 day span.

Obviously, Vegas was packed, and so perhaps it wasn't the most optimal time for MGM properties (all of them, not just Monte Carlo) to decide to do a system upgrade to their computers. What wound up happening was that all of the check-in systems for all of their properties (Bellagio, Aria, Veer, Mandarin, Mirage, Luxor, Mandalay, MGM Grand, etc...) shut down completely for 2 to 3 days, causing check-in times of 1.5 to nearly 4 hours, depending on your property. The Monte Carlo folks at least made up for it as best they could, waiving all amenity fees for guests (who asked for it) and offering everyone a free night stay on a return visit (although I find it kind of shitty they wouldn't just refund one your nights already spent). Since it was a corporate level decision far above them I'm not holding them directly responsible, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention it here.

Most important to me when booking a room in Vegas is what am I going to get for my money, factoring in how much\/little time I will actually be staying in my hotel room. Considering I would normally go to sleep around 5AM and wake up around noon, shower, and head straight out to lunch, I essentially just needed somewhere to put my suitcase with a (hopefully) comfortable bed and a good central location to all the places I wanted to visit in Vegas. We got all of that at The Monte Carlo, with two queen beds in a strip view deluxe room for about $200 a night, which wasn't too bad a rate considering how booked of a weekend it was. (For comparison I just checked a random weekend in July and got about $125 a night for the same room.)

The Monte Carlo rooms may be a bit outdated, for sure, but ask yourself how important the wallpaper and minibar actually is. They've got a nice 40 inch HDTV, but I never even turned it on. What are you paying for? Convenience, that's it, if your trips to Vegas are anything like mine. They've still got a great pool scene, a casino that seemed relatively busy (although I don't gamble, so no clue as to the quality), and some pretty good dining options with Brand and Andre's. The feature show also happens to be The JabbaWockeeZ, one of the best dance groups to hit the US in the last decade. Overall I think they definitely justify the rates they're asking, with my only real drawback being that it's not quite as central as say Aria or Bellagio, but it's also a fraction of the price.",13,6,10

From the valet, to the rooms, to the restaurants, to the gaming.  Low rent.   

Only stay here if you are staying for free.  Like I did.  But, even for free, it sucked.

The End.


If you care to read my ""Hollywood"" review, here you go:

I was only there because my current crush was given a Vegas weekend from his work...obviously, they went with the cheapest place they could get on Priceline.

He flew in from DC, I drove up from LA.

The people at the desk were nice.  Extremely incompetent, but nice.  They fixed everything they had screwed up.  After a half dozen attempts...numerous times.

At the Monte Carlo they don't speak the same language as Vegas.com.  Strangely, they communicate by fax more easily than by internet. 

I got there before Mr. TeeJay's plane landed.  I had spoken with a Vegas.com person to confirm that I was named on the room the day before I left, and I was sent a confirmation email.  Yes, it would be no problem.  However, it was a problem.  

After driving through the desert for 4 hours, the last thing my sweaty ass (110 degrees, broken a\/c) wanted to hear was, ""We don't have you listed on the room.""  Huh...waaa...come again?!?  Okay, well, here is a printout of what they sent to me.

Soooo, they faxed my confirmation letter. 25 minutes later, a fax back okay'd my entry.   Who are these faxing people?

Upon entering the room and  opening the curtains, I gazed upon the construction site known as City Center.  Really?  Eh.  A free room is a free room.  I ain't here for the views.

I Vegas'd myself up, to greet my crush.  Happy greetings!!  Let's go gamble and be fabulous!

Whoa.  Whoa. Whoa.  Who are these people in this hotel?  

No shows.  Crappy hotel band.  Lackluster menu.  Nothing at the Monte Carlo was appetizing.  So, we trekked down the Strip and ended up at the Venetian...where I am a VIP.

Thank you. Thank you. Curtsey and bow.  That will be another review.  However, we are staying at the Monte Carlo...

Sooooo, we woke up the next afternoon, and rolled into our swimwear.  The pool was fun.   Waves, good music, abundant sun (no credit for that) and plenty of chaise lounges for our friends (read: Mr. TeeJay's co-workerrs).  But, ah damn, I forgot my hat.  So, I had to go back up to the room.

It truly sucked leaving the pool and going back to the room to have my key card fail.  Pick up the courtesy phone.  Busy signal.  I kept trying for 10 minutes.  

Seriously, I have not heard a busy signal in forever!  So, I went back down to the front desk.

I waited behind all of the people checking in to finally hear, ""Oh, sometimes the cards de-activate if they close to the cellphones"".  

Are you kidding me?  I have an iPhone.  Eh.  Re-activate.  Through the labrynth, and back to room, only to have the card fail again. 

Don't tell me it's my freakin' iPhone!  That was in my bag, the key card never left my hand.  Lucky for them, this time he courtesy phone rang the front desk and a security person magically appeared to open my door.

It's coming around that time of year again.  Mr. TeeJay will be getting a vacation weekend, courtesy of his work, at the Monte Carlo.  I will be driving up to see him, but he will be staying with me in a much better hotel.",1,0,0

Average rooms and good environment, although empty casino, although that didn't matter for me because I'm not 21 yet. Again, like the Rio Hotel, the hotel room I had had available AV connections in the TV so you can connect your DVD player for the kids. The buffet wasn't that good. I had better.

I asked the girl who checked me in if this was required for everybody, regardless how you booked the hotel, and she said yes.

Granted, the deal with booking.com came up to only $62 (w\/ taxes already) for the King room, but added on with the $20 resort fee, it totaled up to $80 for a Sunday to Monday stay, 1 night.

The cons: 

* No wifi. Again I should have read the fine print! They had the Ethernet cable, but I was using my tablet so... that is a no-no.

* CLOGGED sink. This wasn't really annoying but I called the front desk and they said someone would be up to my room in 10-15 minutes. 22 minutes later, I called again and then they said someone will be up there soon.  Waited another 10 minutes later, the plumber was very nice and courteous- he fixed the sink right away, but shouldn't management require that repaired before you check someone in?

* Resort fee= $20 which only includes...the gym entrance (I don't think anyone goes to the gym while at Vegas!), free newspaper (again, no one reads newspapers when they're at Vegas?), internet (again...no WIfi which sucks, only the Ethernet cable). Coffee maker, and some other stuff that you don't really use while you're at Vegas. 

* I really don't care about decor but there were just stains on the carpet, on the chairs, and some marking on the walls. Kind of outdated.

* The showerhead has green rust on it... which even in some inns don't have that! They really need to clean that out.

* It was 8:30am and I was awoken by someone's alarm or music, and I couldn't help but sing along to it (it was Snow Patrol. Haha). I guess the walls are pretty thin... and I could hear the next door people showering. As soon as they turned on their shower, I would hear the pipes going at it. 

Pros: 

* Clean sheets. BUT I did see one pillow with a dark marking. Good thing you have more than one. 

* Doesn't smell like smoke. Got the non-smoking.

* Quiet A\/C, quiet room! 


I don't think I will stay here again...I guess I will pay an extra $10\/$20 to experience a high end room instead of one that ""pretends to be one.""

The hotel was clean and had a good choice of restaurants & food courts. We booked a deluxe king-bed room on the 30th floor of the hotel and the resulting view was very good and peaceful. The bed and the bathroom were very plain. The spa was very good and clean and the hotel had a free tram facility to the nearby hotels (Bellagio and Aria) on the strip (just like other Vegas hotels). We didn't use the pool and internet cause we were mostly busy doing other vegas stuff.
On the whole , I would rate the Monte Carlo as very moderate. There was nothing fantastic or awesome about it - and considering its great location on the strip you would think the authorities would jazz it up for the attraction quotient ! The hotel guests had no special discounts or booklets for using the amenities of the hotel (except spa -where we were charged a discounted price of 10 dollars). It was a no -frills hotel which offered all the basic amenities with very few notable complaints (the shower was extra powerful and hurt your face, so be careful). This hotel might score still in other locations but in Vegas were people come to enjoy the grandeur and luxury, Monte Carlo appears really drab. I mean, why would you want to stay here when every other hotel in the vicinity (Bellagio, Caesar's palace, Paris, Venetian, Treasure Island etc etc..) have their own free shows, breathtaking interiors and great attractions in the hotels itself for just a few bucks more??",0,0,0

Great location on the strip, but check in and check out process were very slow.  you'd think for a hotel with thousands of rooms the front desk would be able to handle the capacity a little better.  Also, the Monte Carlo Cafe in the casino is one of the worst restaurants I have eaten at.

Few other points worth mentioning:
*If you must stay here, bring your own house slippers or sandals bc the carpet is so disgusting you wont want your bare feet or socks touching it
 *Bring your own toilet paper, their toilet paper was so rough it irritated our bottoms  (we purchased ours from the cvs on the strip)
*bring your own soap, unless of course you want you want to smell like you just went through a dumster
*be prepared for long showers, water pressure was so bad I didn't need to close the curtain when showering and my husband, who usually takes 5-10 min showers, would take 30 min 
*shower head was chrome, the handle gold and the bottom tube faucet shinny silver.
* walls are so thin you feel like you're in the same room

Saved the craziest part for last.  Happened during the morning after our first night there.  Maintenance\/housekeeping was vacuuming the hallway and decided to open our hotel room door, which, mind you, had the do not disturb sign, then vacuum the entry way to our room and then close the door.  Like what? Drowsy, confused, and half awake, we looked at eachother and confirmed that yes that really just happened.

Yet another update, at midnight we changed rooms.  New room smelled like dirty sheets and stale air but was quiet.

It was the maid, she stated ""room check, what time are you checking out?""  WTF?!?!?   First of all, wait a few seconds before you open someone's door.

The food is horrid and expensive. I would highly recommend the buffet at the Bellagio or even Mc Donalds. The rooms were nice but noisy. The couple in the room next to us had a battle and smoked weed to make up. This flowed under the adjoining door. We went to the front desk to report this. They said they would send someone up. This never happened. Not a great safety pro-caution for the girl getting slapped around or for me because I am allergic to weed. There was a mix up on our tier points. I called...9 people later I still need to email to get the points straightened out. That said I talked to the desk manager about the incident and he was very nice and credited us back some funds. I still wish it would have been handled when it happened. That said everyone that we met was very nice, especially the Valet team.


The view from our room was the roof top and the construction site. Not real enjoyable.There were limited channels on the TV and the bathroom needs some construction of its own. The tub dripped water constantly and the paint was a bit peeling. We should have taken better notice of the wallpaper being held up in the main hall by electrical tape. That was nasty.

Resort fees are added to the base of your hotel price. Seems a bit odd since we never used the pool, gym etc. No coupon booklet is given for free play or discounts in the hotel. They should take a lesson from South Pointe, its a nice touch.

We came to Vegas for a week long glass convention and stayed at the Monte Carlo to get away from the noise. That was a mistake. Never again will I use the Monte Carlo. M-Life has a lot of hotels in Vegas. I will try the MGM for our trip n May.

When Monte Carlo opened, their big gambling push was they were going to feature the european style roulette wheel, with just a single zero instead of the hideous american two zero system pervasive on the strip.  The american wheel gives the house a whopping 5% house edge, the european about half that.  Apparently no one noticed, and the MC is back to the two zero wheels.
Worse, nearly all the blackjack is 6\/5, with a few 3\/2 tables interspersed.  No surrender.  JOB video poker is terrible with 7\/5.

I would like to outline for you our experience and how in the future we will steer away from MGM resorts in the future.

We stayed at this resort because my husband was attending a conference and it was convenient for his meetings.  

Comments:
1.  Baggage.  When we arrived, the bellman took our bags and said they would be brought up after we checked in.  He did give us a receipt.

2.  Check in.  We arrived at the hotel at about 11 AM.  There were about 20+ people in line so we elected to go to lunch first. We had a nice lunch in the Cafe.  When we went back to check in, the line had dwindled by 50%+.  When we checked in, the clerk did not offer us an upgrade and did not mention the ""M Card""  just basically gave us the room key.  We mentioned that that the bellboy had the bags and she said matter-a-factly that we just needed to call once we got to the room.  

3.  Room Quality.  The ""standard room"" was very disappointing.  The bed and pillows were uncomfortable.  There were not enough outlets in the room for us to charge items.  2 Keurig pods and no real cream was chintzy. Shower was small.  

4.  Baggage part 2.  After traveling for 10+ hours to get to the room, we called for our bags and was told that we needed the receipt.  In the haste of getting to the hotel, we misplaced the receipt. We were told that we would need to come and identify the baggage and after speaking to a manager of that department, was told that we would have to come down and that there were 3000+ guests, clearly, no VIP treatment here.  After finding the receipt, I was surprised by this practice since the receipt had my NAME clearly on it. AND THE BELLBOY could have checked the ID. Instead I was inconvenienced.  WHY THE BELLSTAND AND THE FRONT DESK don't coordinate so bags magically appear in guests' rooms, I don't understand.

5.  Restaurant.  While we had an ok experience the first time in the cafe, our experience yesterday was awful. We arrived a bit before 8 and waited for table for 15 minutes. After we got table, we waited for server for almost another 10 minutes. We immediately ordered and the food arrived at 8:51.  The bill was never presented. And after we had to rush eating, we left at about 10 minutes later. The person who claimed to be the manager couldn't find bill.  We left a low tip and explained why and he was not apologetic at all. He felt the need to pull the receipt and act argumentative -well your order didn't go in  until....The point was this was a hotel serving 3000 guests, making eggs, isn't that complicated and once again we learned that the customer is NEVER right at MGM.


6.  Front desk part 2.  We went to the front desk to add the ""M Card"" my husband had enrolled for online to be hooked to our stay.  The girl was very confused by this.  He pulled it up on his phone and it had a number.  She said she would do it.  When he asked for a spa visit to the venitian be added, she didn't understand and got argumentative.   She said ""She couldn't be responsible for other people's actions""  What kind of team building do you have?  Clearly she won't ever be in charge of anyone's else's actions and she should be terminated immediately.  Argumentative yes, helpful, no.

7. Gym\/spa.  Very bad.  Really is this a holiday inn?

8.  Cleaning Rooms.  Yesterday, we left our room at 7:45 and went back at 1:45.  During this time, maid service had not come. 

9.  Front Desk Part 3.  When standing in line to check out, 2 check out clerks waved for me to come to them. I went to the closest one. She looked at me confused and I said what, she goes ""I thought you were going to him""--Like she didn't realize her colleague was also waving at another customer who stood in front of him while she was saying this to me.  She proceeds to pull up the account and stating each and every charge--you have a starbucks, a dinner here, a gift shop there, etc.....INSTEAD of printing the bill and letting me look at it.  Very bizarre indeed.  

The point of these comments is to let upper management know that we definitely were not treated like VIPs, that your staff was argumentative, unfriendly and not helpful.  Will not recommend your resort anywhere.",2,0,0

The view, however, was shitty...as there is a ton of construction going on in the area.  (What's new in Vegas?)

Outside they have a ""rapids pool"" where lots of people gather and have fun during the daytime.  That was pretty cool.  Inside there was a restaurant that pretended to be a ""brewery"" but did not brew any beer on sight.  (Fakers!).

The location was convenient, being in the middle of the strip and having fairly easy access to other places on the strip. The outside also is pretty, and there is a new plaza with restaurants and stores at the front of the hotel.
I only gave two stars because the room itself was overpriced. There was not even a hot water kettle for coffee and tea and this was the only hotel I have been to that lacked such amenity. The bathroom was also run down, with the faucets and shower heads stripping and showing discoloration of the metal material.
FYI, it was still free parking when we went, but starting April this year, they will start to charge for parking. The parking garage was also a pain to park in because most slots were filled and sections were blocked off for renovation(?).

Since I was in Vegas for a concert, this review will not be based on the casino (although it would not have made a difference).

It was my first time at Monte Carlo and it just might be my last. I normally stay at Circus Circus which I always have a great experience with despite the reputation it has. This was my first time staying at an MGM property so I was expecting a little more from Monte Carlo. 

I keep my expectations low so I didn't mind the problems other people were marking stars off for (no fridge, free water, old TV, etc.). I think everyone can agree the resort fee is ridiculous based on what was available and what wasn't. 

Upon booking the room through the website there were some problems I needed resolved and I was put on hold several times. However after three people, I had a woman assist me with ease (I don't remember her name). I was so grateful for how fast she helped me--this is what earned a star in my review.

The plan was that I would book one night and my friend would book another night--same room. However it turns out my card was charged to both room despite it being under different name. I dont understand how that could happen when the credit card is only issued to one person. During check out I noticed two activities on my bank account. I wanted to resolve it before heading back home so I wouldn't have to call and be placed on hold. I was told to wait several business days to see if it clears. It hasn't.

I called and was placed on hold. Called again, placed on hold. One hour later Gabby was able to help me with amazing service. I'm still waiting for the changes to be made but I feel all this work was not worth the stay.

Like I said, my expectations are low. I was warned to stay away from the buffet but since I redeemed a free buffet from MyVegas, I decided to try it. I liked it. It wasn't bad. It was free, so why not. I also tried the Dragon Noodle Co.'s sushi rolls and it was decent price. Not bad, either. 

I just feel like what should have been the easiest part of the trip (booking\/refund) took up too much of my time.",0,0,0

I thought the decor was tasteful but not overbearing, and even though it lacks a ""theme"" you still get that Vegas grandeur, so it was nice.  I ate at Brand Steakhouse (again in September actually) and I thought it was really good.  Not a cheap meal, mind you, but very well done and the wait staff was excellent.  I also ate at the Dragon Noodle, and I thought it was only okay for the price.  This may have been because the person I was with was getting on my nerves, but I wasn't overly impressed by the food.  The menu was extensive though.  

The pool is decent, nothing fancy, though there is a wave pool. 

The rooms at the Monte Carlo are decent, not super cheapo but nothing extremely fancy.  I too thought it odd there were only two pillows on the bed, but I don't use pillows so it didn't matter.  Overall I will say the room was nicely sized, as was the bathroom, and the maid staff was on top of things.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, the walls are not the thickest, but who cares if you hear your neighbor's shower.  Who needs complete silence in a room in Vegas?  Who's even in their room when they're in Vegas???

I thought the addition of a food court was nice, because you don't always want to have to sit down in a restaurant (and sometimes you really jsut want subway) and it came in really handy for late night munchies.  However, it wasn't open 24 hours, which was kind of a bummer.  The casino area is pretty big, but not really confusing like some of the other big hotels, like say Caesars.  The Monte casino is pretty much straight back from the street, so I found it really easy to find the rest of my party when we did wander away from each other.

Overall it was ugly and depressing. Also, for a ""spa suite"" they do not supply a coffee pot or a microwave. When we asked for one from the front desk, they told us they do not supply those for ANY of the rooms. Seriously? I have never been to a hotel that did not provide us with at least a coffee pot.

Overall, the 4 star pros outweighted the 3 stars.  We got a great deal that included 2 day entrances to the spa (worth checking out), 2 free drinks at the Monte Carlo brew pub and 2 free buffet tickets.

Their spa entrance is $22 for the day (or just $19 to use the gym).  They have a cold pool (70 degrees), hot whirlpool (104 degrees), steam room and dry sauna.

My friends and I got a hotel room here. I landed much earlier so I checked in in the afternoon. No issues until I got to the room and realized that the outlets in the room were broken, the lights were out, and to top it all off, after a quick 10 minute nap my whole face was covered in a rash - not sure how clean the sheets are (read reviews that there were bed bugs?!)

Anyway, I feel that when a customer is literally going through hell, that the first rule of thumb should be to make things right. Instead, they sent me to a new room that reeked of old cigarettes when I specifically told them I needed a clean room and for the sheets to be switched to the hypoallergenic kind given my experience less than 2 hours ago. The lady at the front desk who I spoke with was curt, rude, and was speaking so fast like she just wanted to get off the phone.

Currently awaiting the third room change - I've been waiting for over an hour now...

EDIT:

Waited an hour and called back down. Turns out they were never even fixing up the new room so I was waiting for nothing. Front desk manager is going to ""make it right"" and throw in $50 dining credit, but at this point, I know for a fact I'm never staying here again.",3,1,1

Checking in was a bit of a wait but once we reached the front desk, the staff was very personable and friendly. We arrived earlier than the 3 pm check-in time but they had no issues finding a clean room ready for us. 

Our room was on the 14th floor which sadly had a terrible view so I kept the windows drawn the majority of the weekend. It was clean and I was happy to find the bathrooms bigger than I expected.

I did notice that during the duration of our stay housekeeping came at odd times. Our room was ignored the majority of the day when we were out but was clean between 4pm and 10 pm when we came back. I'm used to housekeeping cleaning at an earlier time but as long as it's done right?

There is complimentary monorail system within the resort connecting the hotel to CityCenter and Bellagio. Check the times that it runs though. I tried using it Saturday morning around 8 am and it was not running. We ended up walking to Wicked Spoon for brunch which was fine.

The restaurants in the hotel all got less than stellar reviews so I more or less avoided them during my stay. My sister went to their breakfast buffet one of the days and found it lacking especially for its $22+ price tag. Her words were ""nothing to write home about."" 

I did like the fact that the hotel was right next door to a CVS which is open 24 hours a day. It's convenient!

The daily resort fee includes internet access, gym access and 2 complimentary bottles of water among other things. Use of the steam room and Jacuzzi is not included in the price ($10\/person\/day). The resort did not have Wifi. The internet access is via a cord on the desk in the room. 

If you want to ride their shuttle to the airport, it's $7\/person so it's nice if you are traveling alone.

Each time was a decent time spent here - however I realized this past stay it's pretty FAR from the clubs and restaurants I like to frequent. Below is a review of my most recent stay this past weekend - one nighter trip folks. The Monte Carlo is slowly becoming one of those old Vegas hotels like the Flamingo and Imperial Palace. 

Pros:
+ Room rates are great 
+ Room was decent size
+ They have a Casino War table
+ Friendly staff (Valet, Check-In, Restaurant staff) 

Cons:
- Room temperature was just never right (too warm or too cold) 
- Sink and tub clogged everytime someone used it (We had to wait in between showers - LAME!) 
- Food selection besides food court was very limited, it seemed as if the only moderately priced restaurant was the Cafe or Diablo's Cantina. 
- The $10.95 Resort Fee that is mandatory charged for amenities I did not take advantage of. Besides the two mini sized water bottles they left in the hotel room.

Everything started off predictably well - the check in service was quick, and the staff was friendly. But all went downhill when the light of day hit my room. 

No WiFi, and the wired in outlet was on the fritz. The room was not properly cleaned before my arrival. Sure, it was surface swept, but not well at all - the remains of a shopping spree's plastic price tags littered the floor between the beds, the toilet seat was wet, and there were strange black smears on two of the pillows and the outer comforter. Partner that up with a suspicious smell to the water, a shower fixture that could decapitate any royal and soaps that left me so dry I immediately peeled two layers of skin in an alligator like fashion and well... it's not tough to see why I wasn't impressed. 

Salvageable moments: the cabana guy lent me an inner tube for free, but he also made me wait a few minutes while he helped people who came after me. Worth getting it for free, because a $10 inner tube rental for a pretty small and bland lazy river would have really made me feel ripped off. And from the tram station, the pool looks pretty - complete with a beach volleyball court!

First, I booked a smoking room, as my friend (in her first trip to LV) is a smoker. Get here and find out, after getting to the room, that they have no smoking rooms...it was a website glitch that offered it. So can we cancel because they were unable to provide the room we booked, since we found one that offered it (and cheaper) at Treasure Island - a much better hotel and end of the Strip? With a lot of attitude we were told sure we could cancel, but since it was within 24 hours of scheduled check-in and they bear no responsibility for not offering the kind of room we booked, they indeed would charge us for the entire booked stay. Awesome customer service and way to own up for your own mistakes, while earning a repeat customer (sense the sarcasm). Best of all, I certainly expect to find charges for all of our buffets, which were covered in our stay. Though I showed them the confirmation emails that stated it, they had no record of it in their systems. We will find out in a couple days on check out.

Off of the elevator, the carpet looks like it was installed in the 50's and never thoroughly cleaned, since. The air in the hallway wreaks of some spray that smells like a cross between cigar smoke and b.o. The room has cheap, ratty wallpaper and cheap faux brass bathroom fixtures. The a\/c has been on 62° for over 2 days and we are still sweating because it has one small vent blowing directly at a wall. No amenities at all...don't even expect a $10 coffee pot in the room. Not even in the suite we originally checked-into.

The new T-Mobile Arena is next door. Don't expect to sleep if there is any event and you're facing it, because the speakers blare so loud that even 18 floors up, you can hear every word as your windows shake.

Overall, after many trips to Vegas for both fun and work, and staying at a variety of hotels, this has been the worst. (1) Rude employees who do not care whether you get what you booked and paid for; (B) Incredibly dated rooms that look cheap and feel dirty and never cool down thanks to the non-existent a\/c; (3) bad location at the north end of The Strip; (4) Loud, even for the Strip, if you are Arena-side - you might as well be sleeping under a runway at the airport.

1. The check in process took well over an hour due to their servers being down.
2. Due to MC's chaotic and poor organization, a group of guests were given access to our room and actually walked in on us. Thankfully we all had our clothes on! :P

Why it took over 2 days for the servers to get back up and running is beyond me! Are there no IT guys in Vegas??

We were able to get free entry into the spa\/sauna and some credit for room service due to the mishaps. Nice sauna & steam room. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion and other toiletries are available for use. They also have a couple lounge chairs and sofas with veggie\/fruit infused water in the spa.

Everything was outdated, yes, but the sheets were ripped, there were stains all over the floor, the a\/c was broken (on the hottest day on record in Vegas), we found bugs, and the ""strip view"", which I paid extra for, was a view of a few cheap liquor stores and the massive concrete roof of the casino below. On top of it all, there were no extra sheets or blankets in the room, so we shared the sheet that sat on top of the stained comforter. We suffered through a fitful sleep and left early in the morning for another hotel. I will say, however, the woman at check out was extremely apologetic and refunded a good portion of our money. 

If you're young, don't have a lot of money and are looking for a place to crash after you party, Monte Carlo is for you. Otherwise, I suggest going just about anywhere else.",0,0,0

It's a great location and has a lot going on but isn't as crazy as some of the larger hotels. One of the main reasons we always come back is Scott the bartender who works days near the sports book. He is super personable, hilarious and keeps us entertained while we play video poker. The hotel is going under massive renovations so even with less tables and restaurants it's still our top choice. This is the first trip where we stayed in a renovated room and the upgrades are a big improvement. We were pretty bummed out that all of the outdoor restaurants are gone now, and understand they are getting rid of the sports book in favor of a smaller area where you can place sports bets, but we are looking forward to seeing what further improvements are going to be made. I would probably give it a three star rating since there is a lot of construction, but it gets an additional star because of Scott.",0,0,0

That's how Boyfriend and I ended up in Monte Carlo.  PARA LA FAMILIA. Family consensus.  Never mind that  BF and I wanted to stay at the Venetian which is my first choice for my forty winks in Vegas. It has to be where my mom and dad, sister, brother-in-law, baby, brother, etc. (you get the picture) stay.

Monte Carlo is actually not bad:

1. It is on the Strip right across New York, New York within walking distance to the Paris, Bellagio, etc.

2. It's one of the few hotels with no gimmick. It's just what it is-- a hotel, not a theme park, a pyramid, a city in France, etc.  It is still opulent with marble floors and huge chandeliers.  

3.  The rooms were decent although our bathroom had a tiny mold in it. But our room  on the 25th floor with the view of the Strip ($40 more), it was worth it to see Vegas come alive at night!  The hotel was loud but the rooms were quiet. 

4.  Monte Carlo has Brands Steakhouse which was hip and contemporary as well as a so-so cheap buffet restaurant ($20 dinner)  and Diablo's Cantina Club\/Restaurant. It has a spa and pool frequented by semi-nude, hot looking people.

5. I can't really be hating on Monte Carlo since this is where Boyfriend and I won $1000 on a 25 cent slot machine. Yes!  (We only spent $20!)  My family could not believe it since they knew I don't gamble since I'm such a sour loser. (I'd rather go shopping!) Must be my beginner's luck!  

6. What did we do with our winnings? 
     a. Check out my review of Smith and Wollensky Steakhouse. ;)
     b. Boyfriend and I spent $50 on room service at 1 AM for champagne and potstickers which came on a round table with white linen which was wheeled into our room with all the cutleries and our nicely chilled bottle of champagne in a bucket.
     c.  I treated my whole family to a lunch buffet.
     d. Countless cocktails in souvenir glasses while walking on the Strip with my whole family to check out Caesar's Palace, Paris and watch the dancing water at the Bellagio (my dad's favorite.)

Being with my family was equally fun and crazy.  This weekend was for the family but BF sneaked in a little romance on the side.  WHAT HAPPENED IN VEGAS HAPPENED.  I'm so glad it did!",6,5,7

Pros:
-Flat screen television in the room.
-Two bottles of water provided each day by housekeeping, along with coffee.
-Casino floor was clean and enjoyable. FREE DRINKS!
-Breakfast buffet was really good. Plenty of selections for breakfast needs.
-Café restaurant had decent food for breakfast.

The pool was closed for remodeling. Very disappointing since it is June, and the weather is warm.

Upon arrival, our room, a ""spa suite"" as advertised was a total disappointment. For one, I'm citing false advertising as the suite has a large ""tub"" in the room; not a spa or jacuzzi as you are led to believe. 

After dinner and a very late night on the strip we paid for an extended check out time of 3:00 pm. At 6:00 AM we first were woken up by a poorly designed room that lets ALOT of sunlight in at an angle that beams directly onto your face while in bed. Not a great way to say hello to the morning Vegas sun after being out in the strip all night. 

About an hour or so later we were again rudely woken up by another poorly thought out idea by this MGM property. Our suite was right next door to Construction WORK, like right next door to our suite!! Loud constantly drilling and pounding that didn't stop. We called guest services to complain, but the construction kept going on. Not a great way to sleep in after a night on the strip.

I was staying in Las Vegas for work and was put up in the Monte Carlo hotel. 
As for choices of restaurants and their casino, it's like any other, pretty good.  As for their security's willingness to respond to a customers complaint... pretty poor.  

I was on the 29th floor with an adjoining room and the people next to my room were hot-boxing their room and somehow due to the ventilation in their room and mine, the smoke blew directly into my room. 

I called down to the front desk earlier in the evening before I went to dinner and they apologized and said they would send security up to handle it, I'm not sure what happened because I left. 
Then I came back to my room around midnight and went to sleep. Around 3:00 am I woke up out of a dead sleep with cigarette smoke wafting into my room. 

I called down to the front desk again and they had a record of it because they saw that I had called earlier in the evening. They again said they would send up security. As I'm writing this at 4:30 am nobody from security has come to their room. I called down to the front desk again and they acted surprised when I told them Security had not been up to handle it. So, I asked if I could could switch to another room and they said they would set something up for me by 5pm I'll told them I'd be working most of the day so that would be fine. 

This review is really more for their lack of security presents and lack of ability to handle something as simple as a customer smoking in a non-smoking room and it effecting one of their other customers experience. 

Note: When I checked in they asked me what was my ""smoking preference"" and I told them ""non-smoking room"" look, I'm not being a complainer about ""a little cigarette smoke"" it was terrible

I called down to the front desk to let them know they put me in a smoking room and I didn't request a smoking room. She let me know that all rooms are non-smoking. (Could of fooled me). So they sent someone up to febreeze the room. That didn't work. I called back down and request a room change. I spoke to TanShea (I think that was her name) she was very professional and she assisted me immediately. Second room smelled much better.

Check in was brutal 90 minutes on a Wednesday at 4:30pm when i finally did make the counter I commented on what a rush they must be having and the guy said ""it is always like this"" I can confirm this as every time day and night I walked by the front desk the line was way too long. Wifi was awful i called support services and they had me walk down the hall 6 rooms to a hot spot to get on so every night when I needed to work I sat outside room 14 208 so i could connect, on the positive side the wifi was very good so if you need a place to work the connection is great there. When i went to bed I pulled the night stand out a little to get to a plug for my phone (see pic below of the napkin and Doritos on the floor behind the stand) I don't think my room had seen a vacuum in a very long time. It also looked like they had pulled of the phone cord but left the staples sticking out of the wall, seemed very dangerous for an ankle or child. On the positive side I doubt anyone would bring a child to this place as CPS would likely take them away from you for doing so. The carpet in the hall looked like a dead body had been dragged down it and by the elevator bank was truly disgusting (see pics) also the wall in the hall was opened up and the base board was falling off. To add insult to injury I had to pay a $39 nightly resort fee for a hotel with no resort...The pool area is completely closed. They do offer a shuttle to Mandalay Bay but it runs on the hour making it a little difficult to try and catch a little quick sun between meetings. On the positive side my meetings were next door at the Oriental and my buddy gave me his extra room key and their pool was fabulous. The first morning I left a tip and note for housekeeping which I always do (see attached pic) when i got back to my room that evening it was still on the desk, no housekeeping came by. Positive side I saved $5. The last straw was the incredible construction noise that starts at 7am and goes to 5pm, I happened to be staying on floor 14 while they remodeled floor 15 so the noise was crazy loud.

FRONT DESK - Never too crowded and always there to help. I even used the concierge to plan a night out. She called the restaurant and helped me decide on a club to go to, reserving the bottle and everything.

POOL -  Fun, good drinks, but not overly crowded. There were some kids there, but they never seemed to bother me. I did find it odd that they played some serious club music at the pool, and the crowd didn't seem to match the energy they were attempting to create at the pool.

Although somewhat of an older hotel now, I feel Monte Carlo is decent. Beds are fine, bathroom is clean. A few downers though are the underwhelming TV and the funky shower faucet. Perhaps the biggest downer is how audible the water piping is, meaning if someone a room next door or upstairs were to turn on a faucet, the sound would be quite loud. Sounds like a large cardboard box being dragged across the floor.

Other than that, Monte Carlo is not bad. Not the oldest, not the newest. And esp for New Years, I feel as long as you have a bed to sleep on, you should be fine because for the most part you're gonna be out drinking and engaging in your various shennanigans. I know I did :)",1,2,1

When we booked the hotel there was no mentioning about the pool being  under construction. At least give the common courtesy to put it in the front of the web page not this tiny little print where you really have to search for it.

Now comes the worst part. We were booked on the 13 floor ok no problem. Next morning at 600 am sharp, there were lots of drilling and cutting that just rumbled through the room. Seriously they were working next room over and right above us until 600 pm, 12 freakin hours a day!  I recorded the noise so I could back up my claim. Of course I called the desk and told them about my situation. They said they could upgrade my room for an additional fee WTF!!!!! Plus they will throw in a 50 gift certificate meal- LOL 

We ended up toughen it out because I wasn't going to spend another dime and put money into their greedy pockets. 
We didn't even go to the pool at Mandalay Bay or MGM. I was too disgusted with them.

The newly-renovated room looks simple but yet still quite stylish. Monte Carlo is currently undergoing a rebranding process - it will soon become MGM Park. That means there is a lot of construction going on. I, unfortunately, had a construction view room - which actually makes Aria in the background look sooooooo awesome! I lived on the 26th floor so it's not loud at all and I managed to have a very good sleep there. Some down points are -
1. I really missed the free parking a while ago. It was so easy to drive around the strip and enjoy different buffets and shows at different resorts. Those prime days are gone. Now the parking is 10 dollars a day and my parking cards failed to work twice during my one night stay. 
2. The resorts fee is quite high. I don't get it why there is a resort fee when you can actually factor the resort fee in the room rate. I didn't use the pool (it's at MGM) nor the gym (it's on the first floor) so I kinda felt that money went wasted.
3. The checkin line is quite long and slow and there were only three counters (50% capacity) open for customers. They could have opened more counters to expedite the checkin process. The staff is friendly and amicable though.
I hope the rebranding \/ renovation works well and I still look forward to check MGM Park out in the future.",2,0,0

The price is decent for a nicer hotel in Vegas; it all depends on how much money you want to spend. If you want to go cheap you go with Hooters or Excalibur, if you want to pay a decent amount of money you are looking at Monte Carlo, TI or NYNY. If you wanna go big, you're looking at The Bellagio, or Phoenician. Everyone is different, everyone has different taste and everyone has a different amount of money to spend in Vegas, that is why Vegas is so awesome to go to, so many options for everyone! I really enjoyed staying at this particular hotel this time because of its location. I felt like it was somewhat in the center of everything! Not too far down the strip one way! Also anytime I rode the bus, there was a stop about 10 feet from the front of the Monte Carlo, so when I was tired and didn't want to walk, hopped on the bus and took me straight to my hotel, five seconds later im in the casino of the Monte Carlo. Not only do they have a great casino, the restaurants they have are a nice variety to choose from, along with a nice variety of fast food! Having everything you need in one place is awesome in Vegas because you do tend to get a tad lazy sometimes. The rooms were nice, clean, smell free and the beds were pretty comfy! The lobby is beautiful, their convenient store carries anything you would need and the pool is pretty awesome. They have a lazy river, a wave pool, a normal pool and a hot tub! You name it Monte Carlo has it!

I just arrived yesterday and upon pulling up, I was shocked at how bad the exterior looked.  The place looks like a construction site.  When I got to the front desk, it took me a good 20 minutes to get checked in.  Their computers are super, super slow.  When I got up to the room, I was not impressed.  It was very basic and looked dated.  There were some random stains on the bathroom wall.  The internet connection here is terrible, so don't come here if you are a business traveler.  As for the casino \/ entertainment, it looks really tired and unexciting.  This is definitely not a destination spot.

On the plus side, the room view is pretty nice and they were nice enough to upgrade me to a ""City view"" room for the same price.  They do have $5 blackjack tables, which is nice.  The location is also central to other places on the strip.

At $40 \/ night plus $35+ ""resort fee"" this place won't break the bank, but for the same price you can stay at some of the other hotels that are newer and more fun.",1,0,0

We stayed from Thurs-Sat night. We didn't spend as much time in the hotel as we only stayed only for 2 nights. We were checked in super quickly and staff was attentive.The resort fee was about $67.00 after check-out. Our room was spacious and we had a view of the swimming pool--that was awesome. The fact I didn't like was there was no fridge and no other amenities--like coffee, or kettle for hot water. TV had a variety of channels so we were able to watch a bit of TV before sleeping. Also, I noticed we did not get a full box of Kleenex that was in the restroom, which I find a bit odd. Well we only had approximately 15 tissues in there, probably the hotel staff did not tend to replace it since it was not empty before us. Our showers were great, super high water pressure though.There were a few dent\/peeling off the walls inside our restroom, well it didn't bother us. One good thing about Monte Carlo is they had Starbucks, Subway, McDonalds, and other places where you can grab a quick snack. I walked through the casino and it looked pretty nice.

All the hotels in Las Vegas are ridiculously expensive during the weekends in the summer. I had some points on my credit card and Monte Carlo came in as an option. I checked in relatively late so there was no on else in line. The check-out employee was nice and courteous and didn't try to push an upgrade. I got a standard room (I didn't upgrade since I was only going to be here one night.) 

The room was really clean and nice. One of the reasons why I am hesitant to stay in older hotels is that most of them have adjoining doors with bad sound  proofing. (The last time I stayed at New York New York, it was so noisy in the next room, I had to switch rooms). The room that I got had no adjoining door, so it was quiet. The bed was also comfy and was not too hard or soft. 

This place is obviously not as good as Wynn or any of the other 5 star hotels. You can tell it was a little older because there was cracks in the doors and floors. But, for what I needed (a nice hotel on the Strip), it was a great and cheap option. I will definitely stay here again.

Based on the mixed reviews on yelp (many of which aren't too great) I would have stayed away from this place. But the bf found a great deal here (originally we booked 2 nights at Luxor, but for about the same price, Monte Carlo offered 3 nights instead. Score!) Let's begin:

Our Room Floor 21, #113 (3.5\/5 stars):
- It had a nice king size bed, 2 night stands, desk & chair, lounge chair, average sized dresser with a fairly large flat LCD tv, closet and full length mirror, 2 telephones.
My only complaint is that there was no mini fridge to store our drinks (this should be a standard every where). Also, the ""temperature control unit"" had poor circulation and weak output so it took awhile to get the room cool to the temp that we enjoyed. The view we had was not of the strip, but of the back of NYNY and residential area. It wasn't a bad view, in fact it looked nice at night when all the homes had on their twinkling lights or in the morning when the sun would rise in the horizon. It was a relaxing and peaceful sight. You can hear riders from the NYNY coaster scream their heads off, not to mention your neighbors in the adjoining rooms practically fart in their sleep because the walls are so thin. That's my main gripe. The bed was comfortable and there were both firm and soft pillows. The sheets were soft and clean, pretty standard nothing bad about them, but nothing spectacular either.

Bathroom (3\/5 stars):
- shower\/tub combo with vanity mirror over the sink. The toilet was off to the side in front of the shower with a wall as a divider from the sink. The shower pressure was not the best, and the shower head didn't have a wide spread so it felt like I was a flower and a gardener was trickling water over me. And since the shower\/tub floor had a textured feeling to keep you from slipping, if you decided to take a bath be warned! Don't try to scoot across  it or else risk skinning your bottom. Lol. Didn't happen to me, but definitely has the potential. Also, there is a vent that doesn't really suck out any of the steam in the bathroom so if you shut the door, you're in an instant sauna once you finish your hot shower. And don't be startled if you hear a loud whoosh! Sound late at night,  it's just the incredibly loud toilet flushing. Every person who used their toilet, I could hear it flush! Not attractive. 

Casino (2.5\/5 stars):
Didn't really play the slots here, but did walk around and it seemed to have updated machines. Only problem is if you have sensitive smelling or breathing conditions, I wouldn't suggest walking through it. Just getting off the elevators from our room to the food court area adjacent to the casino I was already having a coughing fit from all the smoke. Their ventilation system isnt good. 

Overall, I give Monte Carlo 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 because their customer service is phenomenal. The clerk at check in was kind, personable, and quick. The cleaning staff is nice and on time. We changed out our towels a couple times and had our bed sheets changed once, they were great. Also, the bell hop and valet people were friendly and courteous. They never acted like they needed to be tipped, like many others I've experienced. But generally appreciated their helping us out. That's what makes a hotel good: a hardworking, respectful staff. 

Don't be afraid to stay here because of some of the negative feedback by some yelpers (hey, even five star hotels have their share of horror stories). For it's price and LOCATION on the strip, it is definitely a great value hotel. I would stay here again.",9,0,0

My first night here we stayed in a normal room and it was comfortable for 4 people. The bathroom was large and our shit was EVERYWHERE but still felt like there was a lot of room. For the rest of the trip we were in a suite with a conjoining room. The suite was nice, 1.5 bath, king size bed, sofa bed and a ton of open space to for air mattresses. 

I was hoping that the suite would have had like a kitchen area as well with fridge and sink. You know the basics in most suites. 

I didn't spend much time in the Casino, just walked through and it was your pretty basic Casino, nothing too special. Walked by the food court, which had a McDonald's and Subway- skip this obviously. The pool area was really great, there is a lazy river, wave pool and a huge regular pool. Lots of cabanas available as well.

We returned to find a nice hair ball in the toilet that was apparently pulled from the shower drain, thanks for that maintenance guys. It wouldn't have been bad if the shower was fixed but it was still backed up. We didn't bother calling again and we showered in standing water for the next few nights.   When we got into the spa room we discovered that what used to be a jetted jacuzzi tub has been replaced with a regular non-jetted tub. We would not have paid for the upgrade if we knew they removed the jetted tubs. The lazy river was full of trash and cigarette butts on Monday morning, kinda gross.  It was clean when we returned on Tues morning and we did have fun in it.  The poolside waitresses only seemed to be concerned with the day beds so we could not order anything to eat or drink.

I have stayed at over 15 different resorts in LV and for the money this is a decent place.  It's convenient to a lot of things and my experience with the staff was good as well.  It's not the Cosmopolitain or Aria but you don't pay the same type of price either.  If you are looking for a decent hotel but don;t want to spend a lot this is a good option.  If\/when they do a remodel it will be better but it's still fine unless you are expecting a 5 star hotel.  If you are then look elsewhere.

I'm not saying it's a 4-star hotel, but it gets a 4 star rating in my book when you think about what you get for the money. If I can't find a killer deal at a nicer hotel, I'm pretty satisfied with the Monte Carlo. It's budget & basic, but without being gross or too embarassing (ie Flamingo, Imperial Palace). When I stayed, they were running a promotion where showing your keycard got you pretty good discounts around the property and at NYNY. We took advantage of the 2-for-1 buffet for breakfast just about every day. With the 2-for-1 deal, it was like $22 for both of us which is not much more than if you went to Starbucks.

I also loved the day spa access. I think guests pay only $15 and you can use the steam room, hot tub\/cool tub, and loungey areas in the spa all day. The loungey room was stocked with juices, fruit, and nuts. Definitely worth it to chill out here, especially since the pool area is so insanely crowded. And if you have a lot of friends sharing your room, just run up to the spa to shower if you bought your pass that day, lol. Big showers plus hair dryers, hair products, straightener, razor, everything you need.

I had no issues with my stay, the room was clean, awesome center strip location, and friendly on the wallet. It's also convenient to the free tram that takes you up to the Bellagio. On the negative side, as a ""resort"" it's pretty boring. But the bright side is that you're saving money on the room so you have more to spend outside of the hotel.

Do your research carefully though because I see offers come up for nicer hotels that are about the same price as the Monte Carlo (when you factor in the resort fees).",1,0,0

It used to be a really nice hotel, but this recent stay wasn't as great as I thought it would be. I chose the hotel because it was cheap, good location and I was familiar with the resort. Our stay was not very pleasant. The check in line was over 45 minutes long. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. Room was outdated and needed some renovations. Wallpaper was peeling off and some mold was found in the bathroom tile and ceiling. The room next door had two adjoining rooms full of noisy kids. You can hear everyone's conversation in the next room and hallway. Very noisy and not accommodating. Also we got a few prank calls from another room throughout the night! First time I ever had a prank call during a hotel stay! Not impressed. Although it was fun and entertaining, but not at midnight! We decided to get a room change... They switched us to another room on the same floor, but we decided to upgrade to a nicer room with a bathtub. They gave us a studio at the hotel 32, which they said had a tub and shower. When we had gone up there was only a shower in the room. We called the front desk to let them know it wasn't the room we requested with a tub (additional $50 plus $6 tax on a weekday). They sent us to another studio at the hotel 32 and yet it did not have a tub! After all our efforts, we decided to stay in the room anyways. Needless to say we were thoroughly unimpressed with our stay.. We did not get the room we requested. The studio at hotel 32 was on a nicer floor. You couldn't tell we were at the MC. They had a front desk assistant that was very welcoming. There was a lounge that provided free cold water, juice and soda. They had a machine for tea coffee and hot chocolate, which I did not figure out how to use. For breakfast they offered pastries fruit and yogurt parfait. In the morning they have a newspaper waiting for you on your doorknob. Although really nice service and amenities, still a standard room only renovated.. Exact same room only newer furnishings and bathroom is very very small. The pool is small, overcrowded and mostly in the shade all day!!! Only stayed at the pool for an hour during our stay.

When I walked into the hotel i thought it was very nice, clean and upscale. The lobby and check-in area also gave a very good first impression. When i got off the elevator on the 14th floor i noticed the hallways were outdated, plain, and crusty. When i walked in the room i was shocked, i thought i had booked a 4 star hotel. But the room reminded me of Excalibur, it was disgusting. The ceiling was peeling in the bathroom above the shower, there were stains on the sheets, no mini bar\/fridge, and there was only like 15 channels on the tv. The pool area was very disappointing as well. In my opinion the hotel does not deserve anything close to a 4 star rating. I am not one to complain so I didn't, I just tried to make the best of the stay. I originally booked the hotel via priceline bidding and it was 2 nights for $351 which priceline charged my credit card. Upon check-out the front desk charged me an additional $100, for fees that i thought were already included. And also a daily fee for valet car service and storage which most hotels offer free for their guests. None of these things really bothered me, after returning home i noticed another charge on my card for $300. I thought it was just a security deposit that would be refunded. Monte Carlo informed me that i was charged the $300 cleaning fee for smoking, which i do not understand because i do not even smoke. So my two night stay at the Monte Carlo ended up coming out to around $800. I tried to save some money booking a ""4 star"" hotel and got ripped off. Just pay the extra money and book a nice hotel such as Palazzo, Venetian, Wynn, Encore, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan or Aria.

She came back in about 10 minutes, not too bad.  But, while she got my boyfriend's drink right, she brought me a vodka cran when I'd asked her for a vodka Red Bull.  She apologized, and she said she was going to go get the correct drink, took our tip from us and then left.  And then...nothing.

I stayed at the machine I was on for half an hour and played, and she never brought me the correct drink back.

The room was nice and clean. The air conditioning worked well. The pool area looked amazing, however we didn't get to use it.

They said that the room was under vacant i told them they wouldnt have this problem if they asked us for our confirmation number and our ID for each room checked in so they wouldnt have a problem when assigning rooms. so that was it for then i went had fun and then what happens at the end i see charges to my room i did not do. Since they gave us some money to eat for free because of their mistake we used it and when i was checking out they told me that the charges would drop A FEW HOURS after i checked out. Since it was my first time at a hotel i believed them 24 hours passed and i was still negative in my account so i called my bank which told me that they lied it takes about 3 to 5 days for the charges to cancel. yesterday they finally canceled giving me back my money to my account. today i wake up to an email that said that i only had $22 left so i checked my account and saw two charges from monte carlo which im not sure should be there at all. how horrifying.

I can't say it's really worthy of the Monte Carlo name considering nothing about it really stands out. I try and stay at a different hotel every time I go to Vegas. So far I've stayed at 7 of the hotels on the strip, though my stays tend towards the middle of the pack so that's mostly what I'm comparing the Monte Carlo to. 

I rated it 3 stars because as it says on yelp, it's A-OK. Nothing really stands out to me. The room is your average Vegas room, the Casino is decent but not too special. I guess the casino is a little better for me because I'm not a high roller and unless I'm doing pretty well or feeling particularly risky\/drunk I try and stay below $15 a bet. 

The Monte Carlo does have a pretty good location so it has that going for it. It's pretty easy to get everywhere from the Monte Carlo. It's certainly not run down which is good in my opinion since it seems like a lot of the older hotels are starting to get neglected. Maybe because the economy is picking back up they're able to focus more on revitalizing everything. When I stayed they were doing a small revamp of the outside of the Hotel. 

I didn't think the restaurants seemed like anything too special and their buffet doesn't seem to be rated too well. Having said that though, you can get their buffet for really cheap at Tix 4 Tonight so if you're looking for a cheap meal this might be it. I may be confusing it with some other Hotel though so don't quote me on it.

Fast forward to 2am I get a call from my friend who was staying in the room with me saying ""our bathroom is disgusting, there's poop everywhere."" she told me she called the hotel and there was a guy who came and left and it has been twenty minutes and he has yet to return. I call the hotel and tell the man at the front desk what happened and he said, ""if you're not there how do you know this is happening?"" I get transferred to  management who finally agree to move us to another room and take off the ""resort fee"" (about $25 a day) for 3 days. 

Our next room also has plumbing issues, the water in the sink takes a long time to go down and this room smells like mold. However, it was 3am and we were too tired to care. I would not recommend this hotel as their customer service is unsatisfactory and they have way too many issues with plumbing. Even the guy who helped us transfer rooms said that they had been having plumbing issues, though the front desk assured us this isn't a common occurrence (I assume this was a blatant lie judging by other reviews). 

The only redeeming qualities about this hotel are the pool and the conveniently located restaurants in the hotel (ie: subway, Starbucks, McDonald's, S'barro, a Mexican place). 

I'd also like to add that the superficial reply left with ""deep regret"" on my review and others does not excuse the hotels behavior or show any sort of actual regret or illustrate that things will change in the future. I would never recommend staying at this hotel.",1,0,0

The casino is dark and appears like they cut back on the cleaning crew. We went to the coffee shop and stood behind a party of four(we were 2). There was no hostess around and the patience level got to the point the party of 4 just grabbed some menus and seated themselves. We did the same. The service was terribly slow, although fortunately the food was served hot and wasn't too bad. I was surprised we had to go the cashier to pay rather than the waiter taking the bill but it was, after all, just the coffee shop. So we asked the cashier about the no-hostess and were told it was a ""shift change."" When my wife (perhaps inappropriately) sniped back that was kind of a lame excuse, the cashier said to us ""then go eat somewhere else.""   Maybe a ""we're sorry for the inconvenience"" would have diffused things a bit.   
Finally, the race and sports book is a mess in that they now require a minimum bet before allowing you to get a drink. I know some hotels are doing the same but the Monte Carlo has what I consider to be outrageous betting limits(Some guy sitting nearby told me he didn't get a drink voucher until he had bet $200 on the ponies).

First, let's start with the rooms. The rooms! My goodness! The best way I can describe them are that they are comfortable and clean, which in my opinion are the two most important traits that any hotel room must have and Monte Carlo hits them both. The standard deluxe room is just that...standard. But that's okay because you don't come to Las Vegas just to stay in your room all day, you go out and have a great time! It's functional with the most basic and necessary amenities you need in a room: a bathroom, a comfortable bed, TV and closet space. Any more than that is just extra icing (again nothing wrong with that). 

The check-in process was relatively easy. For such a long line at 5:30 PM I didn't have to wait long. Most of the desks are were open and I was in the line less than 15 minutes and checked in and on my way to my room in less than 5 minutes. 

Monte Carlo also boasts a number of eating establishments that range from fast food to first class dining. The fast-food places are conveniently located right by the elevators and if you're in the mood for a higher end dining experience, Monte Carlo offers that as well. 

One of the main reasons I stay here is because I very much enjoy playing at the Monte Carlo. They have many of the newest slot machines and some of my old time favorites. The table games are exciting and welcoming. The dealers are first rate and are friendly. They are professional and personable and will take the time to answer question about the nuances of the game should you have one. 

Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino is and will always be my go to hotel when I come to Las Vegas. The location is great, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the employees who work here are the best. You can have your modern (and in my opinion) sterile new fancy hotel rooms. I'll stay at Monte Carlo and enjoy it's charm.

The price was right, we booked directly through the hotel not an online site. The rates were much lower because we are Mlife customers. Our first time staying at this Vegas hotel, we knew it wasn't going to be on the same level as Aria, Wynn or The Venetian. From the moment we arrived and got in check in line it was enjoyable. There was a Bellhop\/ Concierge greeting people in line, He was super nice and informative! The man ( I forget his name) was fluent in several languages and really wowed us! My Fiancé speaks English & Spanish and when asked what type of Spanish speaking the man carried on a short conversation, he then greeted the couple right behind us in line and the man wanted to test his knowledge so he asked the man a question in Japanese and was answered with several sentences! Got to front desk and even though we were early and didn't expect a early check in they gave it to us! Which was Great because we had been traveling for 8 hrs! The staff there was very friendly. The service in room was good. The food & drinks were good also. A little expensive, we got 2 Mojitos in lobby bar and it was $28.. The pool area is fun & clean. The only downside to this hotel is that it is outdated somewhat. The room was ok, nothing fancy. We did speak with an employee who informed us that the hotel is going to change its name and do major overhauls on the hotel rooms and lobby.

The hotel and casino is pretty much thin and long to walk from the back out to the Strip. 

The rooms are decent and clean but nothing overly wowing. 

There is a Food Court with a McDonald's, Starbucks, Panda Express. Longest lines I've ever seen at a Starbucks except for LAX in the morning. 

The pool is just OK. There was a DJ but the way the area is situated that a lot of the chairs do not get sun until the afternoon since it's blocked by other buildings. There is a lazy river which is nothing compared to the one at the MGM. There is also wave pool which was nice. The pool bar is ridiculously priced, even more so than expected in Vegas ($75 for 2 salads, a turkey wrap, and 2 alcoholic drinks). Bottles of water are $5, they will not give you tap water, but they will give you a cup with ice and then you need to fill it up at the water fountain near the bathrooms. 

Check-in\/out was relatively simple and easy. Not long of a wait for someone to help you. 

The parking deck for self-parking is large and it's free. It's in the way back of the hotel but it's really not too long of a walk to the elevators to the rooms. 

Clientele ranged the gamut to bachelorette parties, families, young groups of guys, older couples and retirees. 

Plenty of tables ranging from $5 to $100+ minimum. Lots of slots, many only 1, 2 or 5 cents.

Not that I just love family friendly hotels, which this hotel is, but I don't mind it here, because the pool area is big enough for everyone. 
The buffet is good and the location is close to the overpass that takes you into the MGM. There, you can catch the Monorail all the way to the north end of the strip. 
If laying by the pool or riding an inner-tube around the lazy river all day doesn't float you boat, you can walk next door and ride the roller coaster at the New York, New York hotel. In the evenings, it isn't too far to walk to the Bellagio to watch their famous free outdoor water show. 
For me, I preferred to lay by the pool and drown my hangover with a little hair of the dog, then gamble in the Monte Carlo casino - hopeful I'd win enough money to pay for some drinks one of their many bars. 
I think my favorite thing about the hotel is the clean, quiet feel. The clubs\/lounges can be loud, as well as the gigantic gaming floor, but when I'm tired and need a comfy bed to take a nap before hitting the clubs or the strip, this hotels' beds and nicely decorated rooms suit my needs just fine.

We immediately called the hotel, and a very sympathetic person took our information, and told us he would investigate what happened, as well as what they could do fo us, and get back to us within 72 hours. After waiting for 5 days without a response, I called back to follow up. I was unable to speak to the person who originally helped me, and found that the person with whom I was now speaking had a very unpleasant, almost accusing tone in her voice. 

She informed me that there was nothing that they would be able to do, insisting that the negligence lay with us. We were also advised that the first person with whom we spoke should not have committed to returning our call within 72 hours as this was not their policy.

Overall I would say that I was disappointed by the fact that they are not willing to do anything about the broken bottle of perfume (which spilled all over an expensive piece of luggage), but even more unsatisfied by the disingenuous manner in which we were treated. It was an unpleasant end to our vacation and I certainly have no plans to revisit the hotel, nor will I recommend it to anyone I know.",0,0,0

Though the Monte Carlo's lobby does Support my original theory, the rest of the 'resort' leaves much to be desired.

Guest Rooms: Standard rooms are very small, decor is out of date. My thermostat said it was 68 degrees but the room felt more like 78. The bathroom wallpaper was stained and peeling, faucets and knobs were mismatched. The whole place seemed cobbled together from spare parts. My room at the Circus Circus was way bigger and nicer!

Casino: The casino itself is small and doesn't offer enough table games. The decor is typical obnoxious Vegas, but in better condition than the rooms.

Restaurants: Considering the size of the resort, there are a lot of dining options, including several sit-down restaurants and several fast-food places. The Pub is the best of the dining options, but it won't be winning any awards.

Shopping: Forget it unless you love Vegas kitsch. 

Location: Excellent location! This is about the only thing the Monte Carlo has going for it. Right in the middle of the strip, walking distance to most of the best casinos including the Bellagio, Caesars, Venetian...

When it comes to bargain hotels, The Circus Circus, and Sahara are hard to beat. If you want luxury, spend a little extra money, check out the Venetian, Caesars, The Bellagio, MGM Grand, and Planet Hollywood.",0,0,0

I enjoyed the fact that they had a food court with a bunch of my favorite foods. I loved the convenience of it, the person who built the hotel was smart they put the food court right next too the elevators and they knew that the people that would be eating there the most would be the guests of the hotel.  

The size of the hotel was perfect! It wasn't too small and it wasn't so huge that you could lost in it. My favorite part of the hotel was the pool area. Monte Carlo has a wave pool and a lazy river, perfect for their hot weather. I just didn't like the fact that it was ten dollars to rent an inter tube per day.

Monte Carlo would have gotten 5 stars their service, food, and cleanliness was great but I didn't like the twenty dollar per day resort fee they had. I know they need to make money and all but just charge that amount when you first book the hotel don't do it after your guest has already stayed.

It's amazing when older hotels go through a type of renaissance and build its way back up to compete with newer ones, but sadly this hotel is a sad story.  The check in line was long, and there was 1 kiosk for fast check in. My husband and I was looking forward to a pool, because ya know? It's kinda nice to take respite from the 107 degree heat. Sadly, it was under construction and the only option was Mandalay Bay and\/or MGM.

I understand that it is not necessarily the Monte Carlo's fault, and that it should have been explained by my booking agency. I am upset because when I brought this up to the concierge, she was extremely loud and rude creating an embarrassing situation for my family. She kept repeating in a loud voice that we would have to pay the resort fees, and kept telling us it was only ""$20 per day"". The issue is that there were 4 of us in 2 rooms, so it was actually  $40 per day for a 4 day stay or $160. We could have seen a show for the same price. The manager was more civil, but did not apologize for the behavior of the concierge, and basically told us the same thing with a quiet and calm voice and a dirty look.
This set the tone for 4 more days of wishing we were at another hotel. The hotel food was awful, and the ice bar was $25 just to get in.

He flushed the line and rechecked and it was dropping to 60. Let's say the first guy didn't do his job!

My husband and I stayed 4 years ago and much to our delight couldn't wait to return.  The pillow top mattresses were extremely comfortable, everything was extremely clean and well maintained.

Although the hotel is nice for the price, you can see that they must have made cutbacks.  The wear and tear of guests are starting to show. The mattresses are no longer pillow top...at least in the room I stayed in.  The carpets in the halls were stained and even on the 21st floor we could still hear the noise coming from the parking lot.  They room was close to being clean, our pillow cases were stained and there was hair from the previous guest on the bathroom floor and shower walls.  This increases my ""EWW"" factor.  We found the toilet humerous.  Do not stand close to it as it likely will suck you in with its flushing power.

The location can't be beat, good amenities and helpful staff.  I personally would not bring my kids to Las Vegas but if I ever decided to, I would not allow them into the casino floor during the evening as they have now placed scantily clad dancers on a raised stage near the game tables.  They most likely would be in bed at that point however this is just my personal preference.  

Be aware that their advertised price is not their full price.  You will have to pay an additional $12.99 per night when you arrive for the miniture water bottles they place in your room and to pay for access to the pool and spa, regardless if you are using them.

The hallway to my room, the carpet was crumpled and bubbling up....didn't expect that from a 4 star hotel.

The bed...wow they must have used the cheapest mattress they could find. You could feel every spring as u moved in it. 

Shower Head was full of lime deposits, you can pretty much figure out how the water was shooting out if that thing. The tub floor was pretty dirty looking. 

The M Life booth...""sorry our system is down"". 

Don't remember if the hotel has any shows or night life....pretty much sums up the activities there. You'll have to go elsewhere for that. Shopping is definitely a trip to another hotel.

We come here 4-5 times a year and if you read my original review from a few years ago you'll see why.  This used to be a great resort for the price.  This is our first visit back to the Monte Carlo since this summer (the longest we've gone between visits) and I truly feel like its the end of an era for me & my husband that found this place so special.  

At check-in, we were informed that our once free valet & daily parking was no longer such. It is now $13 a day for valet or $8 a day for self parking. I've never paid for parking in Vegas and I kind of thought that was a given when we are squeezed for every cent on resort fees wherever we go. So that was a disappointing start to our trip. 

Then, we got in after dark so when we got to our room & I looked out the window that I was fairly confident used to face the pool, all i saw in the darkness was the faintest visual of a dirt construction area. My husband assured me I must be mistaken and the pool must be on the otherside. After all, Monte Carlo has one of the best pool areas on the strip. I began unpacking and noticed the room just seemed a lot more rough around the edges than rooms we'd had in the past. 

The next day we were rudely awoken by construction at 7am sharp outside in that dirt lot...not exactly the time I'd planned for considering we're in Vegas.  

We walked through the Street of Dreams towards the tram and was surprised to see that it was gone. Every shop, little restaurant, The Pub (a great restaurant) all gone. There was just fake walls everywhere with advertisements for a new Park MGM. Then I realized the doors at the beginning of what used to be the Street of Dreams that took you to the pool area hadn't been there.  We raced to the tram station as it gave a great visual of the pool area and my fears were confirmed. It is gone. It is all gone and its not coming back. They are using the space to make 2 new hotels for the MGM revitalisation. Monte Carlo will no longer have a pool.  Guests will have to pack their items and walk to another MGM resort in their swimsuits to have access to one of their pools...something I can tell you no woman wants to do & is inconvenient to everyone. 

Now I'm laying here on Saturday morning, went to bed at 2am, and was again awoken by construction at 7am sharp. We will never stay here again. I used to be a walking advertisement for Monte Carlo. Now, I will tell my friends it might as well be torn down. I'm angry, disappointed and I want my money back because this is not the resort I made reservations for. Not a resort with plenty of shops, great restaurants, a fantastic pool, and relaxing mornings.

Each time we have been happy with our stay, however we hope with this review everyone can understand exactly what you get when you stay at the Monte Carlo.

Check-In.
I have gotten braver at asking if there are any strip view rooms upon checking into the hotel.  Each time that we have stayed the view has been wonderful.  On our last visit, we didn't get to the hotel until approximately 10:30PM.  I asked the gal checking us in if there was any rooms with a strip view available and ended up on the 4th floor because there were no rooms available at that time.  She assured us that the next day we would receive a text message between 1PM and 3PM with a room change, and all we would need to do is go to the check-in\/guest services area and we would get new room keys.

We received our text message at 10:30AM.  I went down to switch rooms and was helped by Juanita, who I had read in a previous Yelp comment was at best, difficult.  She proved to be the same when I dealt with her on this instance.

The Rooms.
When my husband and I got to our room on the 4th floor our first night, it smelled as though it had just been cleaned.  When we showered the next morning, we noticed that the pressure in the shower was, for lack of better word, extreme.

For the reviews that say that their room\/hallway\/hotel is not clean, I have never experienced this.  When we left the 4th floor to go to the 19th, there was a maintenance man mopping the walls.  He would spray on a solution, and use a mop to wash them.  On a side note, as clean as the 4th floor was, the 19th floor was spotless.

The view from our room on the 19th floor, even side room facing north, faced the Aria\/Cosmo, directly above the Monte Carlo pool area.  The room was better than average, as was the view.  We could see parts of the strip, including part of the Planet Hollywood.  

The Service:
During check-in I had been told to tell who ever I spoke with for my room change that my last night staying with the Monte Carlo was comp'd through MyVeagas.  I had forgotten to do this when I spoke with Juanita, so I trekked back down to the Guest Service desk.  I was told that all I had to do was come down on Thursday morning to get a new key made for that night.  I did so on Thursday before my husband and I left the hotel and was helped by Lorena, who was sweet as can be.  Lorena checked me out Friday morning, and remembered me from the day before.  Kuddos to you, Lorena, for outstanding personal customer service.

The Casino\/Sports Book:
Eh. I go to Vegas to enjoy one on one time with my husband and getting tipsy.  We go to the Sports Book religiously, though, had have a ball making bets on whatever games are that night, whether we know what we're doing or not.  I especially enjoy the older gentleman that works at the Sports Book who looks like what we think of as an old mobster.  The casino appeared to be packed when we came down in the morning, however died down through out the day.  It appeared to us that more people played in the back of the casino vs. the front.

Overall:
We have never had anything but positives to say about the Monte Carlo.  We often comment to others about the value the Monte Carlo is when you consider the price, service, amenities and experience.  We will be back to the Monte Carlo in the future, and are already looking forward to it.",2,1,1

Yes, it's located in a fabulous spot on the strip, and yes it is a pretty good value compared to others, but the yes' stop there. First off, the room is very very basic\/standard. I would NOT describe it even close to luxurious nor upscale. I would say it's a notch or two above the Imperial Palace and well below hotels like Mirage and MGM. Inside the room, there was no refridgerator, the beds were Holiday Inn quality, the toilet had this God aweful suction action when flushed, and the toiletries they provide are horrible (the shampoo made my hair bridle). The hair dryer they provide you was also useless. Additionally, they charge for EVERYTHING. No courtesy toothbrushes. Internet access is $15 a day. To use the workout gym you have to pay $50 for 3 days or $25 for one day!  Annoying!!  Overall, the hotel has a very old, Las Vegas 70's feeling to it. I would actually say the hotel is themed to the Las Vegas era of 1970's. It feels classical in that sense. The Casino is like the hotel, which is very very basic and standard. It has an old feel to it.  I would say all of the restaurants do not stand out, and not many outsiders come to this hotel for the food. There is a pretty nice steakhouse located in the Casino, which has pretty attractive and scantely clad hostesses, but then it occurred to me the only reason why they need attractive women in these roles is because hardly anyone outside comes to this hotel. I would say the only big attraction at Monte Carlo is magician Lance Burton, but other than that Monte Carlo is very dull.  The whole time there we were wishing we stayed on the other end of the strip in the Mirage. That's where all the action is at.

Connected to ARIA, The City Center ( high end shopping mall ), and bellagio via tram system is a nice convenience. Walgreens is right next door incase you need to make a liquor supply run ( prices are marked up considerably, it is the strip after all ). Most of the time the hotel offers 2 free buffet breakfast\/lunch with your stay which is a nice touch. Their buffet is not  spectacular but decent and you can't complain since its free.

Checkin lines seem short. Not at all like the craziness you see over at Ceasar's. They have kiosks for printing out flight itinerary's. The ladies over at the convenience store are super friendly and gave us alot of good tips. We didnt visit the pool so no comment there.

They don't have very many restaurant options, and they have NO shops...other than the one or two that sold the cheap trinkets and the overpriced sundries.  On the positive side they did have a good sized food court that is right next to the hotel rooms.

The location of the Las Vegas Monte Carlo is great since I like walking the strip to go through as many casinos as my feet will let me. I ate at the food court for breakfast because a number of the food chains actually have a breakfast menu; it was quick, good and reasonably priced.

At least the light was over the sink, so I could apply my makeup properly. However, the tiny tub with the shower curtain was so dark, that I could barely see in the shower. The water pressure in the shower was also pretty terrible, and the water felt like a light drizzle. It also took forever and a day for the shower to get hot. I think it was 10minutes into my shower that I finally felt the water reach a comfortable temperature. I had it on the hottest possible, and didn't need to turn it down at all during my 20 minute shower. 

Wifi is only complimentary in the lobby and public areas, and guests have to pay for wifi in their rooms. 

The pool was awesome, and we really enjoyed the lazy river (inner tube rentals at a fee). We didn't get to the wave pool, but everyone seemed to really enjoy that as well. We managed to squeeze into the jacuzzi with about 8 other people. 

The concierge was very helpful in booking Blue Man Group tickets for us a few hours before the show. We got discounts on seats towards the front of the theater, thanks to our m-life membership.

I stayed in the Monte Carlo following a canceled flight (hurricane Irene) for 6 (yes, 6) nights. 

Monte Carlo is not an upscale Las Vegas resort. There, that's out of the way. If you want upscale, go to the Bellagio or Wynn or Encore or any of number of other places. 

What Monte Carlo offers is: 
1) Prime location. If you are planning on exploring the Las Vegas Strip, Monte Carlo make a great home base. It is centrally located and easily accessible. 
2) Totally average accommodations. The hallways may be crappy and old, but the guest rooms are perfectly average. They are no better or worse than a typical Holiday Inn (pre-renovation). Sure, they could use updating, but the beds are acceptable, the rooms are clean and you feel safe while you are there. For under $50 (or so) a night, you will not find a better deal ON the strip. 
3) A nice gaming atmosphere. The tables (blackjack, roulette) always seem inviting and friendly, they have some of the friendliest dealers and in general it is a nice place to gamble. 

The pool and lazy river are decent (nothing spectacular) and the walkway\/access to the CityCenter Tram is a huge plus (it is very easy to get out and explore).

Monte Carlo is not fancy. Accept that and you will have a good time. If you cannot accept that, don't stay there (there are tons of fancy places to stay). 

In general, Monte Carlo attracts a younger crowd (or so it seemed to me in my 6 days there and in my previous visits).",0,0,0

We had a high floor strip view room that overlooked the south end of the strip by the MGM. It was a nice room, just not worth the $$ for the view. I was hoping for a better view of the Strip for what I paid. 

We fell in love with the beds and pillows - so comfy! The bathroom was clean; however, the drains in the bathtub and sink were very slow. No bueno. I would like to see the Monte Carlo catch up to their competitors by adding a microwave & fridge to the room as well as replacing the wired Internet access with Wi-Fi. I know people with tablets would be oh so very appreciative. The new flat screen TV's are really nice - too bad they give you crappy remote controls to use it. You'd think you'd get a nice remote to accompany a sweet TV. No such luck here. 

The pool and jacuzzi are nice, clean and well staffed, with towels at each lounge chair so you already have one waiting for you. Of course, you can get more if needed. The pool is heated as well. We didn't get into the other areas of the pool but from what we saw, they were nice. 

Valet parking was included - muy bueno - and the service was top notch. The same thing goes for the bell desk & security services. I left my bathing suit (brand new and super nice!) in the room and they were able to retrieve it for me. Talk about service! 

Check in was easy but check out was a bit hairy. They don't deliver a print out of your bill to your room, which I expected from the last time I was there. When I called, I was told it was because they have over 3,000 rooms. Translation = they cut staff. I was instructed to view my bill via the TV and if acceptable, I can check out that way. I followed the instructions but man, who would've thought something so easy would present so many challenges. First off, my remote decided it didn't want to work unless I tried 30 times, which I had to do until I got some results. I coudn't view my bill in it's entirety, only a pending charge, so I had to call the front desk back to find out what that was for. Okay, check. I then went back to the TV to try and check out and after hitting the same buttons on my remote like 10 times, I finally got the ""you've successfully checked out"" message on the TV. WTH Monte Carlo? 

MC does need to step their game up, especially for what they charge. Overall, though, despite the check out mess, we enjoyed the stay. I'd stay again although going forward, I plan on keeping my money in downtown Vegas.",0,1,0

Booked a flight\/ hotel deal through Expedia and it all comes down to this: you get what you pay for. I was expecting a little more from the Monte Carlo. Between complete trash and complete class, this place is just plain mediocre. Not horrible, not great. The staff was helpful enough. The decor is kind of plain. The phone in our room was broken, so it was a hassle just to order a cork screw. 

The biggest let down of them all was the pool. They stop serving alcohol at 6 and it closes at 7. AND you can't walk around in the pool with your drink. I thought we were in Vegas! The day we did spend at the pool wasn't all that bad, but it WAAAS their 4th of July BBQ, so they may have ""pulled out the stops"". Who knows.

I We got the 31st floor room which was an awesome view of the mountains and sun rising and freeway full of cars!  I wanted the strip view but the bellman was right.. The new city buildings under construction are hiding Monte Carlo's view of the strip so it was better that we got the other view of Vegas!  The 32nd floor was closed for renovations.. I think the whole hotel is under renovations in general.. the lobby of each floor is pretty empty with like 2 chairs and carpet.. nothing too special or fancy.. But hotels are hotels right... I was barely in my room the whole entire trip anyways! Beds, pillows, and blankets were definitely comfortable for my taste after a long day and night of walking\/gambling around.  Valet is complimentary for guests. There is a parking lot across the street for short term parking which is hard to find though.. It is packed!

The rate I paid for a Sunday-through-Tuesday visit was well below $100\/night, which initially made me question how good this hotel could be. But upon arrival, all my doubts were alleviated. We ended up arriving to the property a bit early (2+ hours before check-in). We waited in line at the front desk for less than 10 minutes. They promptly checked us is and told us our room was ready! That was music to my ears, considering I was running on fumes -- as one often does in Vegas. 

The interior of the hotel is luxurious, with marble floors throughout and a nice soft goods update. Our king bed deluxe room was spacious, had a flat screen TV and came with internet (not WiFi though). The bed was my favorite part! Soft, comfy, with plenty of pillows and blankets, which let you create the sleeping environment you want. 

Downsides: lighting is not enough, especially in the bathroom; you better hope the people staying next door to you are considerate because you can hear almost everything going on in their room; the marble tiles in the bathroom and hallway can be very slippery, so watch out!

There was knocking and banging and drilling and loud talking and everything associated with construction was going on above our heads for the entire 4 day stay. I asked for an upgrade to suite and was told non were available. The best part about the room was the bed. It was very comfortable. It is very outdated. Old furniture. Dirty carpet.

After searching Kayak, our three choices for decent lodging along with budget pricing was Monte Carlo, Rio or Paris Las Vegas. Both the Rio and Paris Las Vegas had mixed reviews while Monte Carlo seemed to be higher end. So we opted for a strip view room at the Monte Carlo.

Now first of all, don't be fooled by ""strip view."" Sure you can see some of the strip however the hotel is not located directly on the strip itself but set back quite a ways. So your view is limited.

I was also a bit disappointed with the dated room - its furnishings and decor. There was no refrigerator or even an honors bar (money making opportunity here) and the shower fixture was pretty gotty looking. I know I'm being a bit particular here but after staying at the Wynn last year, the Monte Carlo was disappointing. 

The hallway where our room was located (23rd floor) smelt like a skunk had been there. I'm not sure if it was actual skunk or someone smoking some skunk weed in one of the rooms. ;-)

Finally, waiting about 10 minutes for the elevator to finally stop on our floor during check-out time was all but ridiculous. I felt like I was waiting for a theme park ride without the theming or the thrills.

All that being said, I don't think the Monte Carlo is a bad place for those looking for budget accommodations. I just know I won't be going back because there are much better places to stay for the same price range.

Cleanliness and customer service are big factors for me!

As usual, when driving from Southern California, I always use the self parking garage because valet is just a waste of time! Just dropping off your car and picking it up is just  unnecessary for me. Checking in, the front desk clerk was friendly and tried to do the usual as any other agent and upgrade me to a more expensive room but I declined.

They offer budget friendly eats like a food court to the more expensive restaurants like Brand. A few shops here and there for the typical Vegas tourists and the drink waitresses weren't around as much, maybe I picked a bad location in the casino to gamble. =\/

Only to learn that all the ""coming available"" rooms were now booked.  Not a phone call. Nothing. So I decided to move to a higher floor. Still charged me an upgrade free for the exact same room just higher in the building. Not a big deal.  Friend of mine joined me, and we went out.  Next day wake up in my bed and I find that I had been sleeping on sheets stained with what appeared to be blood.  My fault for not saying anything.  Later on, come back to find that house cleaning changed the sheets.  I was going to leave it alone.  A week later I get a survey. Fill it out. And a few days later, they actually contact me.  Not once have I been able to get a hold of the guy who's signature was in the email. He's never there.  Doesn't respond to emails eithet. So the token effort pretending to care only irritated me.  Call the front desk and I'm informed that I should never have been charged an upgrade fee to change floors and they're going to refund the resort fees for that one night.  And i was promised that someone would contact me to discuss my stay.  Almost a full month later. Still waiting.  Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.",0,1,0

I've stayed at many properties in Vegas, and this one is above average. Probably not worth much over $100 per night, as there are too many other options above that mark. The main entrance is a bit goofy, as it's on the side. When you stay in Vegas at a resort casino, you'd probably like to drive up at a grand entrance and know what the place looks like from the outside. Instead, you go around to the side to a dreary entrance. 

The staff was courteous and accommodating, so no complaints there.  We took in the Frank Caliendo show which was pretty entertaining, despite some of the reviews on it. I'd stay here again, but only at the right price.",1,0,0

Pros:
- Location: can walk along strip; about a 10 minute walk to Caesar's Palace\/Harrah's and Casino Royale; the hotel\/casino is connected to Aria, which is gorgeous
- Transportation: there's a free tram to Aria and Bellagio
- Food court: has Starbucks (!!) and cheap options like Subway, Sbarro's, McDonald's, etc
- Internet (ethernet cord), k-cups, and waters included in hotel fee (also gym and pool)
- Can control the in-room climate
- Fun pool scene, chairs are always available (even in pairs)
- Had standard room amenities like blow dryer, iron, shampoos\/soaps\/lotions
- Mostly clean (we passed by rooms being cleaned for turnover and housekeepers had furniture moved around so they could clean and vacuum every nook and cranny)
- Modern gym with all the fixins -- plus, you get to walk through the spa, which helps gets you into relaxation mode
- Shopping mall with cupcake store, froyo buffet, inexpensive women's clothing
- In-house restaurants were just OK, but D'vino was particularly good -- they have bar food specials, $6 apps with a drink, and the plates were huge and delicious
- CVS is a 2-minute walk, right beside the casino entrance -- SO useful


Cons:
- Awful casino... high limits, no cocktail waitresses to be seen ANYwhere, many games have moved over to electronic. Just not a fun atmosphere. Go gamble somewhere else, like MGM or Casino Royale. 
- $20+\/night resort fee is pretty high... although, most hotels on the strip charge a fee, and at least this one included some useful stuff
- No nice clubs in-house... although it was easy enough to walk to Hakkasan in MGM or Aria's Haze (in heels!)
- Found multiple holes in our room's walls and sheets... when we complained, they changed our sheets, but we found burn-holes in the new ones. Yeesh. Front desk was nice about it though and gave us a $50 voucher for in-house food credits
- They really, really need to upgrade to WiFi internet 
- There was construction outside the front facade our whole stay, which was pretty gross-looking and noisy but hey, I understand if they gotta renovate


All in all, a worthwhile visit, although the hotel isn't super luxurious, and could honestly use some renovation inside. But I would be into staying at the Monte Carlo again, given all the pros.",2,0,0

My bf and I stayed two nights from Wednesday to Friday. Check in wasn't bad at all. Our front desk clerk, Crystal, was super friendly and even helped us out by getting the incidental fee reduced since we had a misunderstanding of how was going to be charged.

We had a spa suite. We loved the room. Our view was of the on-going construction for the new theatre they're building, so that was a bit of a downer but we still had a slight view of the strip. Bed were super comfy, pillows were a little too fluffy for me but my bf loved them. The bathroom was huge and clean. The wet bar was nice. The furniture was a little dated, but not too bad to complain about. 

This casino was pretty much in the middle of everything and connected the the Aria. The CVS right next door was pretty convenient and we loved the food court with all the quick and similar fast food places.

Here in Vegas with my fiancee and my brother and sister in law on memorial day weekend. Yes the city is packed full of people... the hotel was busy on Saturday afternoon but we luckily got to check in at the vip room which was pretty fast. Now what makes this hotel great is not it's rooms but in the fact that it's connected to a Tram that connects the Monte Carlo to the Aria Crystals to Bellagio!!! That is huge for people who want to travel several hotels worth in minutes and disembark at bellagio which is in the middle of the strip! And it's free!! 
My most recent experience is probably the lowest of all of them but for some reason when my fiancee and I walked into our room it had a trace smell of something resembling pot... not very pleasant. But the other times we have been here rooms have been fine and clean.

In general all hotels on the strip are a bit overpriced but the room felt cheap and we paid extra for a nicer room with a view (deluxe). There is nothing ""deluxe"" about it. It felt old, like a motel 6. The furniture is not nice there isn't a fridge the tv is 20"" The view wasn't all that either. We also asked for King and got 2 queen bedroom. From the aesthetic from the check in and lobby area and walkways you'd expect something a bit nicer. A similar feel in the room and we were definitely disappointed. 
The only plus to this hotel is the pool area it was LIT, good music good food and good drinks the bar tenders are really good. That is the only reason I give it 2 stars. 
If you are staying for 2 or 3 days or a weekend definitely pay the $20 more for any other hotel bc this one is not worth it. The buffet might trick you into being an incentive but it was horrible. No type of service and the food is not all that great. Felt like a cheaper version of hometown buffet. And that is the general service you receive if you call customer service. We asked for a in room menu we got it a day later. The phone lines are always busy also.

After having stayed at the Aria on each of my last three trips, I can't say that I was surprised by the ""letdown."" Apples and oranges. That said, the hotel is actually pretty decent and worth a look if you can catch a good deal on the rate.

I booked a Diamond Suite (caught a very good rate) and after reading some of the other reviews (post-stay), I'm glad I did. It was plenty spacious and was very quite. The room decor and wall coverings are a bit outdated, but the hotel is one of the older on the Strip (built in '96, I believe), so I can't say that I wasn't surprised. But you'd think they'd pay attention to updating the rooms as much as they do the casino floor. But anyway ...

There were other little annoyances that could potentially turn into nightmares for some folks. Like the Wi-Fi. It sucks. No better way of putting it. It is actually free, even on the higher floors (despite what the signs in the lobby say) but it's so weak you might as well not even bother. The engineering guy, Jack, was super helpful (big props to the staff which I found to be very helpful and very courteous), but even he couldn't help with the weak signal. I didn't really need internet access much (thankfully), but if you need to do any business, you may be out of luck. And speaking of business, don't bother with doing anything down in the business center. Just don't. Most business center kiosk software sucks and the software running on their 4 machines is lousy.

Back to the room. As I said, the suite was spacious and very clean. It had an EMPTY  fridge, which is a HUGE plus (don't event think about putting anything of your own into the mini-bar in Aria). Bathrooms were adequate, but being 6'7"" with shower-heads placed for people 5'7"" was a bit of a let down. I'm not much of a tub guy but the tub was the size of a small pool. It's huge. If that's your thing, you'll enjoy that.

The room's view of the mountains was great and I watched quite a bit of the construction of the new arena being built across the street. Once that thing is completed, the view is going to be 100x better.

The food selection was great and the quality was actually better than most of the other hotels. The casino is, well, a casino - once you've seen one, you've seen them all, really. Not quite as smokey as some of the others, but well laid out and not as cavernous as most. Tons of table games (which I liked). Proximity to Aria and Bellagio via the tram was cool and made for easy access to most everywhere if you want to walk.

Overall, once I brought my expectations back down to earth (Aria kind of spoils you), I enjoyed the hotel. I'm going to spread my wings a bit and try another location on my next trip, like The Venetian or the Wynn, but I would not rule out another stay here.",4,0,0

I read a ton of yelp reviews and decided to take a chance on the Monte Carlo.  And overall, I was glad that I did.  

We checked in two hours prior to the ""official"" check-in time and the staff was very accommodating, even upgrading us to an upper-floor, strip view.  We went up to the room and were initially quite pleased.  But if yelp has taught me anything, it's to check the bedspreads.  And sure enough, one of them had a nasty stain. Yuck!   I pulled back the covers and found a hair.  Yep.  So it had to go.  I tore the bedding off the bed and called housekeeping to bring us new bedding and some extra towels.  We went down to the pool for a couple of hours and when we came back the beds had been remade and everything was clean.  The desk chair had a stain and the furniture was pretty outdated, but overall we were pretty satisfied with our room. We did choose to stay here because it was cheap after all...  

The location didn't disappoint.  The Monte Carlo is a short walk from the Strip, which makes it easy to walk to a lot of other casinos and restaurants.  We didn't spend that much time at the MC, opting to walk through the other casinos and hang out in the nightclubs at the Paris and the Wynn.  There is a decent food court near the pool entrance at the Monte Carlo which was convenient for breakfast and lunch when we didn't want anything that would take long or cost a lot. 

Part of why we chose the Monte Carlo was the pool, which we all enjoyed. The poolside food and beverage service was a total disappointment though (we couldn't get a server since we weren't in a cabana!) but we were able to snag some free chairs and circle the lazy river on inner tubes.  The pool clientele was pretty laid back and there weren't that many kids around (which we appreciated).  The Monte Carlo pools have their own yelp reviews that I would encourage you to check out if pools are important to you.  

Overall I would definitely recommend this casino to the budget traveler.  It's affordable, relatively clean (once you call housekeeping!), and well located.",0,0,0

I'm so disappointed by this. I checked in here last night and have another 4 days ahead of me and I already regret the decision of staying here at the Monte Carlo so much that it's 6am and I'm writing this review.

I paid $155 per night at the time of booking and then turns out theres an additional $50 per night deposit and a $33.60 per accommodation per night resort fee. What does that even mean? Why not just include all charges up front in the advertised prices instead of misleading customers. Effectively I've paid more than $200 per night which is ridiculous for this place.

The rooms are ancient. I really mean ANCIENT. They are bare bones with no amenities at all. The lamps, tables, chairs and all fittings are busted up, scratched all over the place and stained and the dusty stained carpets in the rooms and the hallways make you feel like you're in some cheap motel. Not enough sockets to charge devices and the walls are so thin that you can hear all the bathrooms around. I was woken up at 5am today by a kid crying in the adjacent room.

The bathrooms are tiny and have really old fittings. The shower is cracked and dirty all over, the wash basin tap makes a sound like the whistle of a pressure cooker going off and the taps require a fair bit of force to turn and have no precision to getting that perfect lukewarm water is a challenge.

The only thing I've liked about my experience so far was the guy at the front desk who checked me in. He was extremely nice and friendly. 

I looked at some of the other reviews and I see the Guest Relations Manager comment on them about the ""extensive renovation process"" that's underway. The thing is, this apology\/explanation really doesn't fix anything and makes people's stay unpleasant, especially for those who are actually planning to use their rooms a fair bit. They really should make these thing clear at the time of booking so that people know what they are paying for. 

I'm extremely disappointed and embarrassed since I recommended and booked rooms for some more colleagues from my company. We are here in Vegas pretty often for conferences and are trying to scope our goto hotel so that we can just do recurring bookings with them. I was hoping that the Monte Carlo would be the one due to it's central location but it doesn't look like that anymore.

We walked into the hotel the night we wanted to stay there and ended up with a Monaco Suite for about $70. This room was about 700 ft. and had one and a half bath. The room layout was a little odd so it felt as though the space wasn't being used the most effectively. The room came with a flat screen TV but was placed a good 15+ feet away from the bed so it looked really small. Our view was rather horrendous being mostly the roof of the casino and just a little bit of the strip. As far as other Yelper's comments about traveling sound, we didn't once hear a neighbor or someone walking in the halls (and we were right next to the elevator). The other reviews are accurate regarding the rooms being, ah, aromatic. The wired internet would not work at all but the wifi was solid. The room seemed clean enough. It was simply a one night stay and it isn't really like I plan to spend all that much time in my room anyway. There are much better things to do in Vegas.

We didn't check out the spa. Which I rather wished we had since the fee it automatically added. We were actually looking to get the spa suite but they were all booked for the night.

The Jabbawockeez show (MUS I C) was a lot of fun. We got a 15% discount since we stayed in the hotel. It wasn't a great deal but I appreciate any discount willingly given.

The casino floor seemed to me to be on the small side. There were a decent amount of slot machines but not a ton of tables. We were hoping that maybe they had two sets of tables, but after walking from one end of the casino to the other, we realized we would have to make due with what we saw. All of the staff was friendly. The players card works for all MGM casinos so I was able to still use the one from when I stayed at the Mirage. 

I did win $500 at one of the Wheel of Fortune machines. Does this have anything to do with the Monte Carlo Casino itself? No. BUT I GOT TO WIN $500! That is bound to color any trip just a little bit better! =)",2,2,1

Gotta say this is probably the worst hotel I have stayed at on the strip the only thing I can say about this place that is positive is the location. Its located better on the than Luxor and they where about the same price. 

The Monte Carlo is atleast going through a massive remodel so things will be looking up for the property and I'm sure prices will be a lot better bet gotta say MGM should be embarrassed of this property right now because I had a stained sheet on my bed. Also the carpet in the room was shaggy several places in the room had wallpaper peeling off the wall. Also the a\/c didn't work that well.

Most of the places in hotel seemed to close a little early in the evening which kind of sucked because I wanted to grab something b4 I went up and it was only 11pm but whatever. 

I won't be staying here again maybe after the remodel but for right now it would be hard for me to stay here for free. This property should be embarrassed to charge a resort fee with the rooms looking that they have been furnished in Salvation Army decor!",3,0,0

Personally I liked on each level how there's a center lobby right off the elevator with 4 different hallways to go down for your room.. it's nothing spectacular but for some reason I really liked it.

The room's are pretty nice, definitely nicer than a lot of the hotels in a similar price range... I'm thinking that we got a good price because we went 2 months after the fire that occurred there... no concern to me.

Check-in process was one of the longest, if not the longest, of my life...and there was only one person in front of us, and we were in the 'invited' line.   While the lady was pleasant and whacky enough for my liking, my husband put it best, ""It seems like she just came here today for the first time and pretended to work here.""

Nice 40 inch t.v. at least in the 29th floor rooms - from these reviews on here, it seems that the higher floors are considered slight upgrades...we were with a Gold Member, so unsure if this is why our rooms were upgraded\/if it was considered an upgrade..we were on the same floor.

Pool Area is pretty good, but it opens not until 9 a.m.  For the summer months especially, when it's already 90-95 degrees by 9 a.m., it would be much better to have the pool open earlier...and close later.

Dealers, some were duds, some were decent.

Extremely rude player's club staff lady.  Gave attitude for my husband getting a player's card because he had left his home (in Chicago), which I have to imagine many, if not most people do.  With that being said....she said, ""Let's make sure we don't have to do this again"" - later on, he realized after all that, his name was spelled wrong, an extra two letters added on.  

Spacious rooms and very clean, I would eat off the floor.  However, the amount of space goes to waste with no refrigerator\/microwave\/couch\/sofabed, etc.  Shampoo\/Conditioner and like amenities are decent.

Housekeeping did not come to service our room the second day we were there.  We did have our ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on until approximately 10 a.m., and then it was off for the rest of the day.  No service.  We could have benefited from an extra towel or two, but it wasn't that big of a deal.    

Internet, while included in the $20\/day resort fee (additional cost to your rooms), is average, at best.  

Spa area at $10 a day (additional to the resort fee) is actually quite good.  While initially it is irritating, that using the spa facilities (whirlpool, sauna, and steam room), is not included in the resort fee, it is worth it.  I will probably do a separate review for the spa, as I give it 4 stars.  Massages\/facials and what not are your standard over-the-top prices but still probably not as much as other MGM properties.  

Free tram connected to Monte Carlo does take you to the Bellagio, and it's usually only a couple minutes or so wait.  

Room service?  Forget about it.  Tried to call two different times, waiting first for 10 minutes, then at another time for 15 minutes, on hold.  

Starbucks staff (a guy) sucked, as he took orders from an obvious friend of his, and then continued to talk to his friend instead of taking next in line customers.  Finally, when we were ""assisted,"" he was stand-offish.  When asked to toast the bagels, he said, ""Oh no, we don't do that.  The other Starbucks [food court] does that though.""  

Would stay here again if rooms were about 10 bucks cheaper than what we paid, on average of $55\/night.  Probably will not stay again, however.",2,0,0

The lamp shades were torn and broken, the sheets grey and faded, the bathroom like a cheap motel, the mattress uncomfortable and the pillows flattened!

I usually stay at NYNY but got so tired of their poor pool area that I tried the MC, which looked to have about 4 pools, including a wave pool.

Well here's the bad-
The entire MC parking structure is closed to guests! They use it for the City Center construction workers! I was like, WTF? Shouldn't they make those guys car pool or take the freakin' BUS and maybe we'd have less congestion on the Strip? 
So I managed to somehow find a space in the adjacent lot and wheel my suitcase 1\/8 of a mile to the lobby.
The check-in area doesn't have a single line for everyone, but you just pick one host and stand in their line, and watch as others come up and get rooms while you wait behind the slow lady!
The pool area was great, with lots of sun, but they were playing music way too freakin' loud. I won't be back because of that, as I don't think it will change. I couldn't hear the waitress, when she finally managed to drag her tanned ass away from the bartender to ask me what I wanted!
The rooms are way too ordinary for the prices you pay on the weekends.
The buffet was nothing special with a small selection.

The good news is that most of the service there is very good, the location is nice, Diablo's is a rockin' good bar right on the Strip and Andre's really lived up to it high ratings. The food there was the best, plus the concierge had given us a coupon for $25 off when we asked how to get to the restaurant.  The only bummer was that they wouldn't allow me to open my own bottle of wine, which I had brought to celebrate my birthday. This was a rare vintage which they didn't have and I was willing to spend the same corkage as I paid at Mon Ami Gabi ($25) but they have a strict no outside wine policy.

They charged a ""resort fee"" at the front desk and for every single one of the people I was with, didn't mention what the resort fee is for: wired (no wireless, available) internet and two bottles of water in your room.  Well, to get my internet to work, I had to call the front desk three times - the first two times they hung up on me while I was waiting on hold... for over 5-minutes!  And they told me I they don't deliver water bottles anymore.  That would be fine if they admitted what the resort fee was for and gave me something to compensate without me having to demand something.  Mind you, water bottles in a room cost $10.  So I got them to give me two $10 drink coupons.  Only thing is, thouse coupons are only valid in casino bars and, as we all know, drinks are already free in casino bars... so basically I paid a resort fee for antiquated internet (wired) and no bottles of water.  Ridiculous...

On to the staff.  Check-in took forever because there was no management of the hoard of people waiting to check-in.  I waited in one spot, and others who arrived after me cut in front of me.  The front desk people didn't care and instead spent their time trying to upsell people to a bigger room.  Check people in!!  Get it done!!

The casino sucks here.  It's mostly slot machines, which is normal, but there are far too few low dollar and mid-dollar blackjack tables.  The dealers are gross people too: almost every one of them was white trash.  I want my dealer to look like he\/she took a shower.

The rooms were average but the sound deadening in-between the door and the hallway and in-between rooms is a joke.  I could hear people having sex, the couple on the other side arguing, and every single door open and close in the the immediate hallway area.  Sleep was hard to come by, even in the nice beds.  I'm baffled why a Las Vegas hotel still has CRT televisions in regular rooms.  Common... it's 2010 - the room shouldn't feel like a Motel 6.  Also, the shower sucked (shower head is too low and immovable) and the light switch and toilet flush handle were impossible to work.  Annoying.

Location:  is great. It's in the middle of the strip. There's a CVS next door and there's an ABC Store, Walgreens, Showcase Mall (M&M World and Coca Cola Store, movie theaters) right across the street. There's also a bus stop where the Deuce and the express stops right in front of Showcase. The only offset about location is that only the Deuce stops in front of Monte Carlo. If you catch the express, you would have to get off either at Bellagio or Excalibur. It's a short walk to both but I think Excalibur is closer. New York New York is right next door as well. There's also a tram that connects you to City Center and Bellagio and you can catch that by going through the shops. 

Rooms:  The rooms are pretty comfy with nice TVs (so not like the old school TVs IP has) with cable. We were able to get adjoining rooms so it felt like we had a suite (if only that wall wasn't in the way) haha. Rooms are not huge but they are decent sized. Walls are a little thin but being Vegas, we never had any complaints. The iHome on our side was broken (it could charge my phone but didn't play music) but the one in our other room worked so we were fine with that. 

Pool: They have a heated pool, lazy river, wave pool, and a huge jacuzzi. You can rent a tube for $10 but we had a special thing so we got 2 for 1 tubes. The wave pool wasn't very strong so I got bored of that pretty quickly. I liked the lazy river but it got so crowded at times :[

Lounge: A friend and I checked out the Brand Lounge on our first night at Monte Carlo. It was $20 for girls and all you can drink. They gave us each a pink cup and we just kept getting refills. It started off super weak at first and got gradually stronger which makes no sense at all. We had a pretty good time there. The crowd is a little older (mid-late 20s).

Casino: I had some good times as well as bad times at the casino here. I did super bad when I played alone but when I had my friends with me I did fairly good. Haha. We had a good laugh with one of the casino attendants (the guy in charge of the table). The dealers were nice and friendly. 

Buffet: A friend and I woke up earlier than everyone else once so we decided to check out the buffet with our 2 for 1 deal. It was okay as far as buffets go. Not the best but not the worst. I preferred Bellagio's buffet but that's not too surprising. Their orange juice was kinda gross though =\.",4,2,3

We got our deal from hotel.com and it came out to be $269 for two nights plus $50 for the resort fees. That is ridiculous but all the hotels charges that fee. I didn't even use their pool and it cost $20 to reserver a lounge chair even when you pay for that fee. The decor is outdated and so are the rooms! This hotel offer no popular attraction.,9,2,3

It's funny how we end of playing here more than the hotels we are actually staying at. Bottom line is we always seem to win a bit, the dealers are friendlier than a lot of other casinos and the layout is super easy to navigate. Also, the Monte Carlo never seems to get as busy as some of the newer, swankier places.

I usually despise those paid girls who dance on the tables while people are playing their table games but at the Monte Carlo they seem less skank and more friendly (instead of shooting your husband ""I wanna f* you"" looks they actually smile at everyone). 

I've stayed here a couple of times in the past and always thought it was okay. Apparently they've upgraded since the last time we were here. Considering the amount of time we spend here maybe we should consider staying too. It would definitely make the trip from the blackjack table to bed a helluva lot quicker!",2,2,2

It is on the southern part of the strip so walking around isn't impossible. You could see a lot of stuff on foot but would probably want to take a cab to the north part of the strip for sight seeeing. I didn't use the pool or workout facilities so I don't have any rating there. The hotel has a small food court with a mc donalds and starbucks and subway so you can stay on a budget for food. We had a $35 champagne brunch at the hotel's buffet and it was ok. Not amazing but not worth $35. Id stay at this hotel again.,0,0,0

We ordered off Priceline, which said it was a 5 star hotel. When we got to the hotel we upgraded to the spa suite. The hotel did nothing for birthdays which was fine because is figured upgrading up 2 times to the suite would be fine. 

When we walked into the room the carpet was dirty and scratched up, stains all over the walls, stains on the beds, and the spa hot tub didn't have any jets, you couldn't order movies, the only room service was a tiny menu from there 10 restaurants, and the pools were closed. 

As to say we were very very disappointed in the hotel. We travel all over and this is one of the worse hotels I've ever stayed in. The Italian restaurant was great but we ate at an Asain restaurant and we couldn't even touch our food and they made us pay for it.

Just returned from two nights there, and will not be back to MC. To start I had to change rooms b\/c the first room had the carpet along the baseboard completely off the wall - they were nice and quick about changing my room. But, all the rooms need serious updating ... the bathroom was loud (toilet and sink were very loud) and shower was dark and tempramental with hot\/cold water. There is no honor bar or refrig in the room, and the surface areas (desk and dresser) are minimal - the furniture was very old and dumpy. The bed and pillows were comfortable - but that was the only decent thing in the room. Oh, and the walls are paper thin ... I could hear the young kids in one adjacent room, and then at 4am I heard the women returning back to the other adjacent room ... and always could hear people in the hall.

I picked MC partly b\/c of the nice pools (lazy river and wave pool), so my minor daughter could have fun. She did ... but I was very uncomfortable in their pool area ... VERY crowded with lounge chairs - you can't move them, and there aren't tables or even ground space to put your bag, and very few ""cabana boys\/girls"" to help you find a spot. Of course the best spots are the premium cabanas, for premium prices ... no thanks. Also, it's very claustrophic with all the buildings surrounding and encroaching on the pool area. And, to top it all off, my t-shirt was taken from my chair! (Thank goodness my ID wasn't taken, but my shirt had been on top of the chair and when I returned from a spin around the river, it was gone. I checked lost and found numerous times, but it never turned up. Tacky ... I thought the clientele would have been better.)

The only highlights were that the food court was decent for families (McDonald's, Rubio's, Sbarro etc.), we didn't have to walk miles to get from self parking to the elevators or pool, and bed was comfortable (when the noise from the hall or adjacent rooms didn't keep me awake). Oh, and they get a decent amount of TV channels including Nickelodeon for my pre-teen daughter.

The Monte Carlo is horrible compared to where I've previously stayed on Vegas. Where do I begin? Let's start with the room.

Room: super old school, dirty carpets, nicks in walls, chipping paint etc. I've added photos to this review so you can see exactly what I'm talking about, but the worst of the worst was the bloody bandaid that I found on my shower wall on day 1 that remained until day 6 when I left despite me telling the housekeeper about it. Also didn't appreciate the holes in the sheets and the lack of hot water! Now I stayed on the 17th floor and when I say I like to take hot showers I mean steaming up the bathroom almost too hot to breathe showers lol. So I thought maybe I'm being unfair and the water does get hot just not as hot as I'm used to. WRONG! I polled several of the hundreds of women at my conference and they all said the same. The water feels hot when it's running in the tub but when u turn the shower on it's like warm at best. It's also hard and made my skin super dry, but I was told my a local that Nevada has some of the hardest water in the country. Funny I don't remember that from my previous stay but whatever.

Housekeeping: not worth their weight in salt! Housekeeping never changed the sheets, cleaned the tub or toilet. They only thing they did was provide new towels. I had to request soap. Also didn't appreciate leaving my room at 9:30 am, coming back at 3:00 pm and still having a dirty room. Especially when the same housekeepers were in the hall in the exact same location ""cleaning rooms"" when I left and returned. The last thing I didn't appreciate was the housekeeping staff placing my items in my luggage bags despite them being out of the way. It kind of makes me feel like they were going through my luggage and made me uncomfortable. I've never had that happen before.

Dining: so I loves the cupcakery! Great tasty cupcakes and Starbucks was good with pretty fast service. I also appreciated the 24 hr fast food places in the hotel. This proved very useful with my early morning flight. The Cafe was where we ate several times. Good food horrible service! They seem to be understaffed no mater what time you patronize them (I went during normal business hrs and late at night\/early morning) and the service is very slow so if you're in a rush to catch a show you may want to skip this place. The good thing is they had 2 for 1 house wine for happy hour and it was good. The buffet was okay, not worth $20 bucks in my opinion, but hey it's Vegas!

Overall this hotel could use a major renovation big time! The only reason I gave it two stars is bc the waitresses in the cafe are very hardworking and try their best to accommodate you and the food is decent. I wouldn't stay here again or recommend anyone else to.",4,2,3

Innocent civilians and Monte Carlo regulars desperately rushed to their vehicles to escape the madness. Horns honked in an oddly harmonious (and very deliberate) unison to agitate staff, straggler employees strolling around the parking lot were harassed with a barrage of complaints and questions- questions I harassed them with myself. 

If it lasted any longer, there is no telling what level of mayhem Monte Carlo would have unleashed onto the city from that parking garage. Turns out paid parking isn't such a good idea. And after 30 shitty minutes, everyone who was parked on floor 3 got detoured out of that fucked up garage to the backstreets. For free.

The suite was beautiful in design and layout, very well appointed, very stylish, very nice. 

The TV could have been larger and HD I guess. I mean, they put in a flat panel, but then it is small for the room and not HD, so why upgrade to a nicer TV when you go with the lowest end nice TV possible?

The slots were very tight.

We always stay at the MGM, however, our ""hook ups"" no longer works there. I found a room at the Monte Carlo for around $100 a night, which seemed really reasonable. 
When we walked into our room, we both looked at each other like ""WTF!""
First of all, there is no comforter. Only a semi-thick sheet. It was definately not a hang-over friendly bed. The top sheet had a rip in the middle, probably about 3 inches long. Also, there were stains everywhere! All over the pillow cases and sheets. GROSSSSS!!!
The A.C. hardly worked. We had it all the way to 60 degrees and on high, and we both woke up sweaty during the middle of the night and the morning. And as for lighting? What lighting? Out of 4 lamps, only two worked. I had to apply my makeup in the dark....which is luckily the look alot of Vegas girls go for. =)

The pool situation is so sad. One pool was about as big as my mom and dad's pool. The lazy river is nowhere near as big as the MGMs and there were about 1,000 people crammed into the tiny pools. You could barely see water.

Last April while visiting some friends that were staying at the Monte Carlo in Las Vegas our golf clubs got stolen from the trunk while inside gambling. We should've learned our lesson then and never stay there again. After checking in on Friday my girlfriend and I proceeded to our room only to pass a group of four individuals with their door open having an orgy. I didn't care so much but my girlfriend was absolutely disgusted. I asked housekeeping if they could let the people know to please keep their door shut. That night after gambling we came back to our hotel room only to pass that same room doing the same thing. Oh well it's Las Vegas. That night we couldn't sleep because the people across from us partied until 9 AM. I went down to the concierge and ask them if we could please switch rooms and they informed me that there were no rooms available being that it was Halloween weekend. They did however tell me that I could upgrade my room to a suite if I wanted to fork out an extra hundred and something dollars. No thank you. Saturday night was no different we had a terrible time sleeping and just wanted to leave early Sunday morning and chalk this hotel experience up as a loss. Sunday morning as we walked to the parking garage to grab something out of the car We saw it was gone! Someone had stolen it and our belongings as well. Our stupidity for leaving valuables in the car. We called security and they called the aria security and both were trying to convince us we mis-parked our car. After an hour or so of trying to convince them that our car was not miss parked they finally went to the cameras and saw the truck we had driven in on Friday and told us we were right we did park in that parking garage. We filed a report and tried to figure out how we were going to Get back to California the following day. Ultimately we had to Rent a car Monday morning. This was by far my worst experience at any hotel I have ever had. Have been here twice and have had things stolen from the garage twice. If I were to ever go back it would definitely have to be free and I definitely would not leave a vehicle in the parking garage.,0,0,0

Sadly, during their current reconstruction phase, this hotel has gone downhill fast! The casino itself is still pretty nice and the front of the hotel with their different dining options are still up to par with the strip. Just don't expect the room to be up to date. 

During our last stay, they stuck us on the seventh floor all the way at the end of the hallway where at least one third of the wing of the floor was occupied by loud college kids that didn't know how to sleep or talk in a normal voice. Walls were super thin and furniture was pretty beaten up surprisingly. I'm sure they would have moved us if we complained but figured we weren't going to be in the room that much anyway. Yeah, we should have moved. But you know what was louder and more obnoxious than those kids? The GD DMN construction going on seven floors down. One word, brutal! If you stay here, you have to choose a room as high above the ground as you can get and even then you might still hear those beeping tractors. 

I won't be returning to Monte Carlo until they finish their remodeling and transformation process. Which I read isn't going to be the Monte Carlo any longer but the new MGM Nomad hotel. So expect the room rates to go up and be on the level with aria and cosmo because it looks like it's going to be uber nice! Until then....",4,0,0

Anyways, the first night, I hardly slept because of the noise from toilets flushing and water running. I could also hear the neighbors who were up all night and others that were up real early. In the morning, I went downstairs to ask if I could have a different room. They kindly moved me to the very last room  on another floor. 

Well, it was the same thing again. Plus, at 5am, I was awakened by construction noise from the Aria hotel next door. OMG I was there for a conference and getting absolutely no rest. By day 3, I was a zombie. 

The hotel rooms are ok but nothing special. In fact, my sheets had several holes in them. Not what I'd expect from a place like this. The Monte Carlo seems a bit out of place on the strip with all the other hotels having themes and nicer rooms. This hotel is plain jane. It's a total disappointment. 

I went to the buffet one evening which was ok. I'd give it 7 out of 10. 

The pool was closed this time of the year like most Vegas hotels. I really wish they'd leave them open for those of us who like to sit in the hot tub and are in the city for something other than gambling.

I would like to see the Monte Carlo torn down and the other hotels nearby take over it's space. The new Aria or the neighboring New York New York could expand. Otherwise, the MC really needs some work. 
The price was great but I got absolutely no rest at all. 

When I was checking out, I asked to speak to a manager about my terrible experience. She comped me the resort fees and said if I hadn't booked and paid through expedia, she could have done more. Good to know they at least care about customers. However, I would never stay here again. I've stayed at better Super 8's. And really, being in Las Vegas, your hotel choices are endless.

Upsides: great location if you would like to stay on the strip. Walking distance to many other casino. Service at the front desk was excellent. Price was reasonable for the quality of the room, minus the downsides in the room (see below) Sports Book was friendly but a bit understaffed. minus 5 bar is cool (literally)

Downsides: Bar tenders at almost every bar in the casino were slow, seemed unhappy at their job. Bit of a ""Debbie downer"" attitude (but waitresses were great) rooms had no WiFi capability. This one baffled me, but they still used an old school hardwire plug in. So dont bring an ipad an expect to use WiFi. The bathroom in our room spelled like sewage. Good thing we didn't spend much time in the room but the odor was bad. Smelled like the plumbing was backed up. 

Our experience here started off a little rocky with not being able get a WiFi signal in the room. Especially when you have work that needs to be done. 2nd was the smelly bathroom and taking a hot shower just made it worse. Then walking down stairs for a drink and having slow\/rude bar service did not help. But with the rest of the trip going well and hotel being right on the strip, it was worth the stay. Would do it again, just as long as the plumbing issue is fixed",3,0,1

I know I'll never be able to afford something like the Wynn or any of the other fancy hotels, and I'm fine with that. No one goes to Vegas to be in a hotel room, right? 

After staying at NYNY the year before, we decided to stay at the Monte Carlo this year to save some buckage. As long as a hotel room is clean, I can deal. However, some of the aspects of the Monte Carlo's room cleanliness were a bit questionable... we had a few not-sure-if-they're-clean-but-they're-super-crunchy towels and there was an interesting stain on the curtains... blood or nail polish? We decided to believe it was nail polish. Here's hoping. But, whatever. If you drink enough, you won't even notice these things.

Aside from the room... we had excellent service from everyone working at the hotel. We befriended one of the Player's Club guys, which netted each girl a free $20 to gamble with every day... and my free $20 allowed me to win $250 on a slot machine. They essentially payed me to win... who can complain about that?? We scored a bunch of free buffet's from the wheel-o-free-stuff that was outside, and we definitely ate the hell out of that buffet.

The only major downside is all the construction that is going on next door at the moment... it really kills the whole lay by the pool & relax vibe. You can't relax when you're too busy picking dust & dirt out of your drink, teeth & eyes. If you're looking to lounge by a pool, this is not a hotel for you (at the moment, anyways). It was apparently the windiest day in Vegas, ever, and people were freaking out about it. Vegas, I laugh at your ""high winds""... you would most likely fall over if you spent a day in Chicago. 

Overall, I was fine with the Monte Carlo, even though there were a few cleanliness concerns on my end. I'll probably stay there again until I meet a sugar daddy that is willing to pay for a 5-star.",0,0,0

Check-in was an easy process although there was a long line and the mobile check-in was not working. Everything went pretty smoothly minus the new resort fee of $100+ and also $10\/day for parking. Something we weren't aware of, but apparently that is the new policy as of 2017. However during our stay, the pool area was under construction and we were told that we can go to any MGM affiliated hotel to use their pool. Which was a little bit of an inconvenience, but luckily there is a free tram\/shuttle that took us close to must hotels. You'll just have to wait in the heat for 7+ minutes for a tram\/shuttle and walk to the hotel you wish to use the pool at. 

Upon booking our reservation, we request for two connecting rooms with two queen beds, which they could not honor. However after insisting that we prefer the two queen beds, they mentioned that due to the reconstruction our rooms will be shaking and it would be extremely noisy. Mind you, they start construction at 6 AM! Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but what happens in Vegas is a raging headache from a hangover!! Not something you want to deal with so early in the morning. :( But what else can we do, when we already pre-paid for our rooms? We deal with the hangover and noise, that's what. 

The night before we checked out I had a lovely surprised in my bed. BED BUGS!! Luckily, I only found one sandwiched between the duvet and comforter. Let's just say I was freaked out, killed it and slept with all the lights on in hope that it would scare the bed bugs away. It didn't and I was bitten, I guess not everything you find on Google is true. But I was hopeful! Anyways, I called front desk to speak with one of the manager on duty. I believe her name was Laura. Super helpful and reassuring. I left the hotel feeling better, with the promise that if they found any evidence of bed bugs than they would compensate by getting my clothing and luggage steamed and free of bed bug larvae. 

Since it was my last night and I was heading back home, they said that I could just leave my luggage and everything I had in the hotel room in my rental car so that the Las Vegas heat could hopefully kill off any bed bugs. However, if my house is infested with bed bugs than they will also compensate for the inspection cost. Let's just say when I got home, I received a call from another manager on duty who said that their testing for bed bugs in my room was a negative. I was surprised at their finding and mention that I was bitten, to which the guy repeated that the result was negative so it couldn't have been bed bugs. Long story short, I mentioned that I have pictures of my bites, the bed bug, and a video of me killing the bed bug! That must of shocked him, because he was silent for a bit, but then came back and asked if I had a management team he could contact about this issue. Uhh...no it's just little ol' me trying  to get the room resolved before you gave it to the next guest! 

Overall, this trip was a disaster and how Monte Carlo's management team handled it was a disgrace to MGM. But I must say it was a pleasure speaking with Laura. She was the only one who seemed to want to make sure that I was okay and that my items were safe. So my tip for future guest is if you want to stay a Monte Carlo for whatever reason, just make sure you take pictures of everything and hopefully you have a helpful and thoughtful manager!",4,0,0

There was one concierge who went through a heck of a lot of trouble to switch our Cirque Du Soleil tickets after we missed the show we'd signed up for as part of our vacation package. We received no information regarding the show other than confirmation that we had tickets so we didn't realize the tickets were for the night we arrived. He was very professional and polite and made 5 or so calls to sort things out. I don't know whether those were real calls or not but he made a great show of it.

The service beyond this one gentlemen was extremely lacking. We had to pay $25 to check in before 3pm even though we arrived at 11am. Neither of us wanted to walk around the strip with our luggage so we paid it. They will hold your bags for free but failed to offer this option until we were ready to check out. 

At check-in we requested a king size bed rather than two queens since we were there for our anniversary and it was the off season. The lady checking us in was polite but smug and rewarded us with a room facing the roof, dirty towels, dirty sheets and a crusty tub. The room was intended to be handicap accessible but the tub was raised to the point where it was dangerous to step out of it onto the slippery marble floors. The glasses in the room were scummy and there was hair on the towels and sheets. When I called room service to swap the sheets after discovering makeup stains and hair they replaced them and put on another thin top sheet which was tucked under the mattress (instead of a bottom sheet). A lot of things happen on these beds, I want more than a thin top sheet between me and that mattress. 

The pool was much smaller in person than in the pictures and its directly under the rail system that connects the hotels which is public and loud. Don't believe the pictures for this hotel, the lazy river and wave pool are comically small. We felt so out of place we left almost immediately. It's not worth the $10 to rent a tube and most people just float instead. 

The Monte Carlo's location isn't horrid, it's next to a lot of other hotels\/casinos but it is on the end of the strip meaning if you want to go to the Paris, Mirage or the Wynn it's going to be a hike. 

Upon checkout we explained our experience to the lady at the front desk, she apologized and immediately asked for the $25 a day resort fee. 

The airport shuttles pick you up out back where the only seating options are some concrete benches.

In summation, I wouldn't stay here again. The Monte Carlo needs a solid polish, a proper update and better customer service.",6,0,1

Good, centered location on the strip...nice casino....great restaurants. Didn't get to go to the pool, but it looked nice from our room. VU at the front desk was very accommodating---we weren't pleased with the view in our original room so she moved us too a better room on a higher floor. Check-in and check-out was easy and fast and all staff was pleasant. My only complaint would be that they do not have room service, but I would stay here again and recommend it for people who want easy access to entertainment and food on the strip.",1,0,0

The only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is because the walls are paper thin! We could hear our next door neighbors sneeze! Then we got a gaggle of drunk girls, who loved screaming, jiggling our door handle (this hotel is old enough to still have room-connecting doors) and playing an array of rap-country-rock music at 8 am. Also, we had a couch in the room that was awkwardly placed at a weird angle by the bed, making surrounding bed space uneven and hard to maneuver around. Also, I used the jets in the tub, and by next morning, there was black residue on the tub.

Other than that, the cleaning staff was very friendly, the decor was new and modern, the lobby was lovely, and valet was somewhat fast. Its location is NOT the getto, but smack in the middle of the strip, so everything is close and accessible. It is waaaay better than the Luxor and in a better location than the Wynn. I'd recommend it.",2,0,0

Four of us got a killer deal of three nights plus airfare for about the same price as airfare alone.  I mentioned to a few people where we would be staying, and got the Ewww looks.  We normally stay at Harrah's due to their generous comping system, and it's always nice.  But, I figured, the hotel is just a place to crash, it just needs to be decent.

It was decent.  The rooms were clean.  Housekeeping was prompt when we requested extra amenities.  The water pressure was good and the water was hot.  

So, why only 2 stars?  1) 95% of the employees act like they hate their job and they don't care who knows it.  2) There was some draining problem in the shower and you wound up with 3 inches of water with each shower.  3) The casino only tracks table games if you play $25\/hand.  I have a ""system"" in Pai Gow and vary my bets, and this rule seems unnecessarily elitist.  (All MGM\/Mirage owned hotels are the same)  4) Housekeeping knocked inappropriately... when we had Do Not Disturb on and when we called down and asked housekeeping to skip us.

I had reserved a late checkout during my recent stay until 3 pm. I was in my room at approximately 1 pm after having taken a shower when Housekeeping came into the room even after having the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign outside on the door. I told the guy to leave the room after he was surprised I was still in the room. I told Housekeeping the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign was outside for a reason. He then left. I immediately packed up my belongings from the room and went to the Front Desk to report the incident since obviously Housekeeping doesn't understand what ""Do Not Disturb"" means. I spoke to the manager ""Zachary"" at the Front Desk and informed him of what happened. He blamed it on ""the System"" and said Housekeeping has the right to come into the room. I responded by saying: ""Even if there is a Do Not Disturb sign out front AND I have a late checkout at 3 pm!?"" Again he blamed it on the system. I told Zachary I have no plans to return to Monte Carlo nor would recommend the place to anyone since he did nothing to correct what happened. He ultimately crossed the line with horrible customer service when he responded by saying ""that's fine"". After asking him how they will improve the situation, he said they'll look into it since it seemed to have been a one time thing. Great management skills there Zachary.
Customer service skills needs to seriously improve in addition to security since apparently privacy is not a priority at Monte Carlo.",0,0,0

The hotel is pretty central strip. It's in between Aria and New York and right across from MGM. The hotel is pretty nice and the staff is good. We had no problems checking in or out. 

There was one problem in that we had our do not disturb sign on the door all weekend but when we came back from a pool party on saturday we came into the room and one bed had been made. First, we had the do not disturb sign on because we didn't really need the room cleaned. Second, if someone was coming into the room to clean it, I would have locked my things up in my suitcase. This was a minor problem with us. because we didn't want our things being gone through which is why we had the sign up. But it appears that the sign was ignored. 

Other than that, it's a nice hotel. It's not the Bellagio but it's not Harrah's. It's a nice room that is in between the two in regards to luxury.",1,0,0

With that said the Monte Carlo is a standard hotel IMO.  One gripe is that we paid for an upgrade to have a room with a view and there was no view.  Hey Monte Carlo - a high floor facing away from the strip is not considered a view just so we're clear!

This hotel is out of date withe electronics in a massive way.  You have a hard line Internet line that doesn't work (too loose for my lap top) and no wifi.  The outlets were not close and were all used by other electronics so if I wanted to charge my cell I had to unplug something to plug in my cell, very inconvenient for the modern person.  

The hairdryer is in a bag at the top of the closet like it's a game of ""where's the hairdryer"".  Who wants to play that game with wet hair?  Not me!

The beds are not the most comfortable in the world, I've had better.  Check in and check out was a breeze.  Overall a fine hotel experience although I think I would error on a higher quality hotel on the strip instead with more modern upgrades for those of us living in the 21st century.",2,0,0

+1 Love the Deal or Deal $0.1 machine.  
+1 Dealers were patient with me as I played roulette for the first time.

Hotel\/Amenities
+1 Pool Area is cool and close to the elevators unlike the MGM where you have to walk nearly a mile to get to the pool area.  They have a small wave pool. a lazy river, and a kiddie pool for the little ones.  
-1 The drinks at the pool are super expensive though so get buzzed before you come.
+1  You can find rates as low as $55 and cheaper if you are a Las Vegas resident. 
-1 You can still smell smoke in the non smoking room.  I recently stayed at a non smoking room in MGM and did not smell a hint of smoke because they designate the whole floor as non smoking.  
-TV sucks and decor is outdated.
