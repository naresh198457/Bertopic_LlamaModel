Thanks to some of the pictures of the rooms on yelp, I knew a lot about the hotel already.  I was bummed to find out on here that the rooms did not have a mini fridge and it did kinda get in the way also because they didn't even have an ice bucket so we had to use the trash cans to fill up with ice, then pour into our cooler.

Also with three people staying in a double queen room, it was really hard to find enough power outlets for all of our phones, they had most of them taken to power their displays inside of the room.  

Overall though it was a really nice room, I love the decor of the whole place, the casino was nice, the halls were nice and it just made it a cool place to stay.",1,1,2

The elevators to the rooms are camoflauged pretty well. Aesthetically nice, drunkenly not nice.

The hallways are nice - the wallpaper modern and pretty. We stayed in the Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen room. Our room memorablilia was Michelle Tanner's overalls. It was nice - I loved that show.

The double pool is nice, we were able to choose to sun where the bachelor\/bachelorette parties were nursing hangovers, or where there were kids splashing about.

It was a good location, lots of things to do - I met up with my friends and the kids that live in Vegas at the mall and grabbed a bite. and the heart bar was cool. I would stay here again with family.",2,1,0

First thing is the obvious self parking. The valet parking for the hotel was always full every day. So no choice to self park. If you're lucky you'll get a spot near by the mall entrance. 

Then walk through the miracle mile, Then into the casino to find the elevator to the room is a long walk. For this reason I won't return to this hotel. I love the miracle shops which is a huge plus but the layout of the entire setup it so stupid. Why didn't they put an easy entrance to the casino? 

Next thing that was annoying was this hotel doesn't have free wifi. I figured well, that's okay, we can use our phone data. Wrong. There's NO service in our room lmao. Don't know if that's just bad luck or the hotel it's self. 

The room window view we had was the pool area lol. Ehhh. 
The decor of the room was average. Basic.  A frame of wheel of fortune. The table was cool though with a clear glass and decor inside. The lighting is very dim though. The bathroom is well lit and very spacious. Very clean. Maybe some signs of wear and tear on the shower. Spacious closet with a lockable safe. Dual sinks in bathroom. Toilet door separate from the tub and shower. 
The TV is a little old but nice.  

The casino is good, but some slot machines were out of service. The drinks were good. The process to sign up for total rewards is very quick and easy.  If you don't mind hauling luggage to and from the mall, don't care about wifi, and parking then you can get by fine with this hotel because of its location.",0,0,0

I find the dealers friendly, but I have had issues with play tracking by the bosses.  It's hard (if not impossible) to get proper credit for your casino play if they don't properly track, and it's very annoying.  

The rooms vary.  The ""resort room"" is much larger than the standard room.  It also has a larger bathroom with a separate tub and shower.  Ask for upgrades when you check in, last time I got one during the middle of the week.  Many rooms have a view of the strip, including the Bellagio fountains.  So, check on these as well.  The standard room is just that, standard.  Nothing to write home about.

There are good restaurant choices, Strip House and Koi are solid.  Of course the famous Earl of Sandwich is busy 24 hours a day, but they get you in and out quickly.  The attached mall has some solid choices as well, including Lobster ME.  I give the place 2 stars due to gaming issues and the quality of the rooms.  But, you can certainly do worse on the strip. There are good places to eat, and it's in a nice location, so it has that going for it.  If the price is right, I'd stay here again, but it's not among my first few choices.",2,0,1

The hotel is part of a huge complex with a mall attached, so we never really had to go out except for the golf tournament.

In 110 degree heat, there were no water stations anywhere either inside the hotel or, worse yet, by the pool. My friend was even told to hike it to a drinking fountain when she asked one of the poolside servers for a water. There are limited drinking fountains tucked far away by the bathrooms. I'm assuming the hotel wants people drinking alcohol only or paying $10 for a bottle of water which is basically promoting dehydration, and quit frankly, bulltshit. Bottom-line: they are not looking out for the well-being of their guests. 

Bath Products - the ""pleasure shampoo, conditioner, and soap"" is vomit-inducing and smells like cotton-candy flavored perfume I wore in middle school. Absolutely disgusting. 

We went to Planet Dailies, the diner on site, twice for breakfast and it was surprisingly pretty great food with equally great service. I ordered a piña colada by the pool, on the other hand, which was over-priced and so disgustingly sweet I could barely suck it down. 

The casino wreaks of smoke and the casino bar serves ridiculously over-priced drinks. The pool is pretty lack-luster, located on the 6th floor rooftop above the casino, where there is virtually zero shade or trees, making the heat worse. Overall, there is nothing special about this hotel. I wouldn't stay here again.",1,0,0

My roommate and I decided to be fun and spontaneous (rather than our planned-in-advance selves) and just book a room and go.  And we did just that! (this has nothing to do with the hotel, I just wanted to introduce the story) okay, so you've got that we were excited.

We booked a room for a really cheap deal, it was like $58 each for one night, which seemed reasonable.  When we got to the hotel on Saturday late afternoon we walked right up to the desk, no line.  Well, at first we wondered through a mall trying to find the casinoo--but that's another story.

The front desk woman said that because we were only there for one night they were upgrading us to a suite. ""hmm, cool,"" I thought.

We walked down our hallway, door after door after door, and all of a sudden two huge black doors with OUR room number on it appear.  'This can't be right,' I thought.  But instead I jammed that key card in the reader and turned that handle as fast as I could to get inside (in fear they might realize they had made a mistake and the suite wasn't supposed to go to the two goobers oogling over double doors.)  

Inside was a living room--a living room!! FOOSBALL TABLE INCLUDED. (if you know me, you'll understand that has awesome written all over it) plus couches, chairs, 3 huuuge tvs!! two bathrooms!! and a view looking out at the bellagio.  oh man, this was just bomb.com (I think I can use that expression cause it's vegas, right??)

After screaming and jumping for joy for about a whole 7 minutes, we decided to get ready to go out on the town---actually we really stuck to a few slot machines and roulette tables...but you get the jist.

Rooms: 3.7\/5.0
Honestly a hit or miss on the rooms.  As I stated, the age of the building is apparent and it's the rooms that show it the most. Over the last several years I have noticed an improvement in the plumbing issues I encountered years prior.  Depending on your budget and use for the room, PH does offer a variety of option which is nice!  I have stayed in most of them and the Panorama Suite has been my favorite. This last trip I stayed in a smaller room but on one of the renovated floors. Very nice!  Clean, white tones and practical amenities. And the Bellagio view was awesome. 

Food:
No rating as the individual restaurants earn their own. 
Ramsey's BUGR...ehh.  
I do recommend YOLOs with the guac they make in front of you. 
Strip house steakhouse: must try! Get chocolate cake. Separate review done. 
Buffet: one of the best (value and selection.). Sometime I go just because the soft serve and desserts. 

Casino: 4.2\/5.0
Dealers are pretty nice.  Some are downers which really sucks, but noticed an improvement in this problem lately.  Never had long waits for cocktails, and the pit bosses never gave me problems when I ask them to call for one. Slot attendants are available and are friendly. Loose slots? Sometimes, just never for me.  It seems anytime I play a slot game, everyone else playing is hitting bonuses and my machine sucks me dry. Ohhhh!  And they have dancers in the ""pleasure pit."" So half naked chicks dancing on poles in evening. 
  
Overall 4.1\/5.0
A great spot on the strip. Right across from Cosmo and Bellagio.  It's got a good balance of age. The younger crowd loves the louder and fun atmosphere.

Checked in about 6pm on a Monday night and waited maybe 15 minutes to check in. Check in was a breeze and was upgraded to a very nice room with a view on the very top floor. I wish I got the name of the guy that checked me in as he was extremely helpful. Gave him a nice tip!

So we stayed on the very top floor which I hear is blocked off for VIP guests\/upgrades. Once we stepped off the elevator, I was amazed at the blue decor. Very pretty decor and we walked off to find our room. First thing I do is go to the window to see our view. Perfect view of the Bellagio fountains. No buildings in our way! Our room also had a coffee maker which we didn't use. We also had a fridge! The majority of Vegas hotels do not include fridges. Loved the bathroom which was huge with a soaking tub, seperate shower, seperate toilet and huge counter space for my never ending beauty products. 

Huge flat screen TV in the room plus a smaller flat screen TV in the bathroom. Our floor was pretty quiet. No rowdy crowds, but we did stay during the week. The housekeeping staff was very friendly to us each time we passed by and was courteous enough to call us one day on the phone to ask when we would like our room cleaned since we hadn't left for the day yet.

The walk from the parking lot to the rooms is a farther walk, but I didn't mind it. I mean, you're already walking a lot while in Vegas, what's a couple of minutes more going to hurt? 


The casino has their Pleasure Pit section with hot girls dealing and hot girls dancing on the tables. It's more lively on the weekends though.

Deluxe room (Hollywood Hip Room) - standard size room but it feels larger than most of the room in Vegas. 42"" Panasonic PLASMA TV.  Ex-Sheraton Sweet Sleeper Mattress with Planet Hollywood Duvets.  Deep Soaking Tub.  The room is very spacious if u have 2 beds, you can easily fit in 4+ people if u get a sleeping bag\/rollerway bed without feeling cramped.

Resort Room - Those are the rooms that are sticking out on the lower floors.  Some rooms facing the pool , while others looking out to the strip.  Same features, slightly bigger in size so it has 2 separate (non-connecting) sinks.  Larger shower area too.  This is the biggest room you can get at this property if you want two queen beds.  Everything above this category is King bed only. 

Resort Vista - The corner room of the Resort Room wing.  Nice view of Vegas strip in the bathroom.

Strip Suite - Located in the center of the hotel.  Either facing North or South.  This used to be referred as the ""honeymoon suite"" during the Aladdin Days.  No door in between bathroom and bedroom.  Can be bothersome for some people.  My biggest complain for this room is that there's no curtain blocking out sunlights from the bath room so in the morning, it can get very bright.  But the round\/love tub in the bathroom is very lovely if you have the north facing room. Enjoy ur bath while watching bellagio fountain show :).

fast check-in

good food and shopping
good vibe
good room rate

Cons:
waaaaay too smokey
billing issues
front desk rude upon check-out

When I researched pricing these rooms had a great price point.  I was under the impression that the rooms would be a lot better than they were.  Our room was dark and housekeeping forgot to dust.  Not just in our room but our friends across the hall had an inch of dust on their table as well.  When I visited another friend's room I thought she requested NON-SMOKING but could smell smoke like someone was smoking in the next room.  When I got back to my room the same this was happening.  Although we had non-smoking rooms the smoke must be cycling thru the vents.  I came back home with a monster of a  sinus infection from all the smoke. 
When I checked in I paid the balance on my room and received my receipt.  When I checked out RAHMAN argued me down saying my balance was $144 and some odd change.  I explained to him that my room balance was paid.  Not to mention when I made the reservation for 5 rooms they charged all 5 rooms to my card causing me to have insufficient funds fees.  I was told nothing would be charged to hold those rooms.  After talking with billing they refunded all of my money.  I guess they had to listen to the conversation I had with the person I spoke with when I made the reservation.  She told me nothing would be charged.

Only two guys working at the check in counter and one gentleman checking in the VIP guests. It was sooooo slow. Took approximately 45 minutes to get to the front of the line. 

So once we got to our room called for bell service and our luggages were brought up right away. The room was nice and big. Got the Brad Pitt room. Lol.

She booked the fountain view suite for $700 and I was like WHAATT?! This better be the suite on the strip! Walked into the room..DISAPPOINTED. two queens and bathroom. mmm...more like a standard room. So i asked the front desk and they said it was a standard room. and I asked why is it called the fountain view room? ...turns our we had a view of the fountain from bellagio. -_- what?! im not gonna pay $700 for that? i was tripping balls man!

Second time i came here...Much better! I came here with my boyfriend and we paid $213 for a standard room. Walked in...King size bed, pull out couch, nice coffee table, a huge bathroom, a view of the strip, a tiny kitchen with dishwasher, sink, and a micrwave. Oh and a TV. I think we got a suite. SWEET.

So yeah my friend got ripped off. Thank goodness I only stayed for one night and paid $30. Argh.

Pros:
EARL OF SANDWICH
lots of affordable shops

Cons:
so far from the parking lot",3,1,2

We had the Bruce Willis room... had some items from his TV show. Can't remember the name right now. Anyway, the bathroom was upgraded and spacious as well since the toilet, tub and shower will all separate. I guess all the hotels on the strip are doing the same but it just seems PH did it right! 

The casino is not that big but I like it because you can easily find a good game and your friend(s) if you get separated. The Miracle Mile mall is also a plus with Urban Outfitters, Ben Sherman, The V Show, GAP, and several cookie, coffee, and drink spots.  Its not filled with the Dior's, Tiffany's, Gucci, etc like Caesar's and Bellagio so anyone can shop it.  

The buffet is okay. They tried to emulate RIO with all the different food stations (asian, mexican etc). KOI was booked so we didn't get a chance to try it. The 24 hour diner gets a thumbs up for serving one of my all time favorites... CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! 

The Sports Book is TOO SMALL! They did serve Pinks hot dogs on Sunday however its hard to enjoy when you can't sit and watch the game.  

If the Buffet wasn't average at best and the Sports Book was a little bigger, PH would quite possibly get a 5 from me.

At the last min ( 5th night) we had to book a hotel ,being that we didn't make our flight so , I picked Planet Hollywood as a choice because I stayed here for a frens bday awhile back and it was decent the room and the price.  My fiancé and I finally checked in and the room number was 1826. We walked into the room and I was ahead of my other half and when heading towards the bedroom, it was a memorabilia of a suit hanging on wooden holder mannequin in a glass showcase. I nearly died and screamed!!!! My fiancé then entered the room and he said oh shoot did someone leave there suit. I said no but this looks kinda creepy just hanging there with its back turned. Finally I was able to read the paper that was hung up on the wall next to the suit hanging in the closet. It was the suit worn in Carlitos Way. The last time stay  there I didn't recall the hotel having hung memorabilia's in the room the last time I Stayed , meaning it must have been small.  So I called the front desk explained to the operator and she said wow I would have passed out as well and then she said hold she would transfer my call to someone that can help. So I waited and a girl came on the phone and I asked her can she change my room because I don't feel comfortable in this room. First of all it was all the way at the end in the  corner horrible horrible view and very old.  She said that each room has a memorabilia and she said that she couldn't give me a refund , but if she changes the room it would be An I love Lucy theme with her dress hanging . I said to her is she serious Lucy is dead and I don't want anything in my room that I am paying for for me to remember her , who cares. I just want to be comfortable so, I asked to speak to a manager . Then I hear the manager in the background saying what does she want???? Is she serious not even coming on the phone to assist me. Then the girl on the phone suggest that house keeping can come and put a white sheet over the glass case. I mean how professional is that. A white sheet hanging from the glass across from the bed with the tv connected to it. I said no I'm not settling for that. The phone hung up didn't even have the courtesy to call the room back. So I hung up, I  don't know if they were crazy or not to think that I wasn't in the hotel . I was just going  to get refund and lose the 60 something dollars for that one night just to be comfortable and book somewhere else. I went to the front desk spoke to agent and asked for a manager she said he was in a meeting. Then this gentle man regular worker took it upon himself to ask me what the problem was and he solved it for me . He gave us a junior suite with a great view looking out at the Bellagio Water show. That was awesome his name was MICHEAL and he helped out a bunch I can appreciate what he did. I just felt like I was giving the run around I work in customer service and I know what it feels like to be on the other end. Especially when your paying for something instead of people taking it as a joke like the management did that day, offering to put a white sheet up. Totally unprofessional and not a good look for this hotel. That's why the Aria is a star ,, no comparison though , just expect better service.",1,2,1

Well, when you compromise what you spend you also compromise what you get in return. We used to stay here when it was the Aladdin and a few times when it became Planet Hollywood. I must say that even Monte Carlo was better then here. But this last visit....well...

The Pros:
Right in the middle of the strip
The shopping center

The Cons:
The valet!!! Ugh, how can you advertise that valet is available to Planet Hollywoods guest and when we arrive, they tell us its closed to only VIP members?! WTH

Waiting for valet return your car takes at least 75 min on a weekend and on a Monday, it took them 45 min?! WTH

The buffet...it sucks here, dont even try it.

The room...we had to ask to change room because the shower did not work and the mattress had a dip on both sides of the bed.

The 2nd room still had the same problem with the mattress and the pillows? COME ON!!!! Clearly they needed to be replaced and we had pillows that were all 4 different sizes! WTH

Long story short, Planet Hollywood made our stay uncomfortable.

The hotel has become very run down, the clientele trashy, and not to mention couldn't sleep an ounce with the base vibrating in our room from the club next door at the Cosmopoliton, as well as being woken up at 3 a.m. by drunk people pounding on the doors, and a guy who tried to break into our room. The cabinets in the bedroom and bathroom are chipped, we found a blob of hair in our bed, and the carpet is pretty shabby. When we complained to the manager she said there was nothing she could do except bring us ear plugs and give us a food\/beverage comp, or give us a smoking room, except that I'm highly sensitive to smoke. We're on a conference here and this is a total nightmare. Most hotels would upgrade you, but this hotel's service proved to be just as good of quality as the rooms. 

The horrible experience didn't end there. The next day we were awoken at 5 a.m. by a drunken party next door, and banging on our wall. At 10 a.m. we were woken up by pounding on our door. When I opened the door, a drunk guy was claiming we were in his room, and proceeded to push his way in. My husband and I had to hold the door with all of our strength to keep him from coming in. I was shaking and distraught from having to fight a break-in first thing in the morning. We called security and they never followed-up with us.  

When we mentioned our experiences to the front desk agent upon check-out, we asked to speak to a manager, who refused to come out and speak to us, until we finally demanded it. Manuel, a supervisor came out and had zero sympathy for what we dealt with, not just this morning with our intruder, but throughout our whole stay. He said he was not responsible for what happens here, which is completely unprofessional. The hotel is absolutely responsible for everything that takes place on its property. Who knows what would have happened if we were not able to push the guy out of our room, and he offered no apology or acknowledgment for anything. 

Finally after I demanded, we received partial resort fee credit, but it did not compensate for all that we went through, especially with the attitude that he gave us. The management here is clearly untrained to deal with customer service issues. It doesn't take a lot to keep guests satisfied, and we left feeling angry, violated, and unheard. 

Don't come here if you value your safety, money, or sleep. I could see this kind of service in a lower-priced hotel, but what you get for what you pay is ridiculous. This is the first and last time we come here.",1,0,0

My husband plays in the WSOP, and we didn't care for the outdated rooms at Rio, so we decided to try another Total Rewards Hotel. 

We ended up being able to get a really good deal on some suites at Planet Hollywood because of our Total Rewards Card Level. We ended up with the Panorama Two Bedroom Suite which was good for my husband and I, and the other couple that was with us.

The suite was very large and very easily suited for a large amount of guests due to the large amount of seating. Tons of chairs, a big sofa, kitchen area w\/ stools, etc. There's a jacuzzi in the middle of the suite, as well as two separate bathrooms and a bedroom with a king size bed. All rooms contain memorabilia from Hollywood movies. My room was a Sharon Stone room which had various memorabilia including mannequins with outfits from movies she was in. Not going to lie, in the middle of the night, those mannequins freaked me out. 

Anyways I'll let you know what I didn't like first -

Overall Cleanliness - Right away the room didn't feel clean to me. I ran out and purchased Clorox Wipes and bottles of Lysol and drenched and wiped everything in that suite. I wiped off orange\/yellow residue from the kitchen area which grossed me out because I automatically assumed it was either A) Alcohol or B) Alcohol vomit. There were specks of nail polish on the bathroom counter and a smear of makeup on the mirror. Not to mention that wiping the nightstand revealed a black film. EW! Also one of the sofa chairs had suspicious stains all over it, and should have been cleaned or replaced. 

CONS:

Dry Air\/Circulation - Everyone that stayed at PH were waking up crazy congested every day. Several days I had dry blood in my nose. Whats up with the air in this place? Stayed at ARIA during my trip as well and didn't experience it.

Old Bathroom Fixtures - The sink knobs and faucets were all corroded with lime build up. Every one of them. The shower head was completely covered in build up as well as the floor drain and bidet. I was thoroughly grossed out. The shower head had poor water pressure. My friends room had a leaking toilet and when you turned their faucet on, the water smelled like sewage.

Do Not Disturb Sign Bandit - I had a do not disturb sign on my door every day and every day I had housekeeping barge in on me. Either there was a Do Not Disturb Bandit roaming the hallways every day taking signs off of everyones doors, or there's a serious shortage of Do Not Disturb signs. 

Housekeeping - Half-assed. Some days the bed wouldn't be made but I'd notice our towels were replaced and our toilet paper roll was changed. Or sometimes the garbage wouldn't be emptied, and so on and so forth. 

Poor Beds - In my friends room, the bed was broken and they said it felt like they were sleeping on a box spring. If you sat on the edge of the bed with all of your weight, you'd tip the bed over. They eventually switched rooms, and unfortunately, they received another dud bed. My bed in the suite was luckily comfortable.

Pool - The pool is great and all, but if you're planning on sleeping in, the pool is so loud in the morning, you won't be able to sleep through the DJ and the music. On the weekends, my friend was getting woken at 9 AM with Nelly Down Down Baby. 

PROS: 

To be honest, as far as the HOTEL ROOMS go, there are none except for the window view, which was only decent. As far as the hotel\/casino itself, I like the fact that it's near a Walgreens and has the Miracle Mile Shops and is walking distance to many of my favorite places (Cosmo, ARIA and Paris are all next door). There are also decent food places in Planet Hollywood and the design of the casino isn't too bad. 

The lack of cleanliness is what really turned me off of this place. I know all hotel rooms are dirty. I just don't need to see it. Especially $700\/night rooms. Won't recommend to anyone.

Also, this casino attracts a really young, party crowd. If you're looking for something more sophisticated, look elsewhere.",5,3,1

I don't know what a 5 star LV hotel experience is really suppose to look like... But I was extremely satisfied with my stay at Planet Hollywood and definitely, DEFINITELY plan on staying here from now on when i visit Las Vegas. 

When I arrived i didn't have to wait in a huge line for check in, my wait time was about 10 minutes. HOWEVER, I did see the line get long- and I'm sure some people had to wait at least an hour to get checked in... I'm assuming. 

During my stay i was lucky enough to get the 'Matt Damon' room(sarcasm) since he's such a stud(sarcasm). I was on the 20th floor and was facing the strip and the Bellagio Fountains. I believe i paid $69 a night- and the room comes with a free bottle of alcohol each night(sweet deal).

The casino floor is a nice size filled with slots- with only a handful of table games. Most of it is Pai Gow something or other... only a few straight BlackJacks. The only table game I played at PH was Roulette. The dealers are all smoking hot.

The Buffet here is so-so. I only had breakfast here, and wasn't super impressed... HOWEVER, if you use your coupon from your VIP book you save $5 i think... so it's a deal! 

The Pros: 
- The VIP book they give you has tons of great money savers for their in house businesses, including a $25 Match Play for any table game(which i used on roulette and won! They paid me $50 on my $25 1 to 1 bet!)
-The location of PH is perfect. You are smack in the middle of the strip- never more than 1-2 hotels away from checking so many more things out. 
-The whole vibe of this hotel is fun. From the sexy casino floor girls with their boobs hanging out, to the modern decor of your hotel room filled with flat screen TVs and Hollywood memoriabila... this place is just about having a good time.

Minor Nuisances:
-The Ice Machine on my floor was broken, so every time I wanted to get my ice for my alcohol I had to go to another floor.
-The shower clogs up quickly. You'll quickly find that you're standing in a pool after about 5 minutes.
-The internet is NOT FREE, it's somewhere in the $13-$15 a day range... Internet should be free at any hotel nowadays. 
-There was no fridge in my room
-After a long night of being up in Vegas, drinking and having fun, the room service decided to knock on my door at about 9:30 A.M. in the morning while i was asleep and woke me up.
-On the last night that I stayed here, valet parking was full. I had to park in the self parking and walk the ""Miracle Mile"" to get to my room... The next morning when i left, i had to drag my luggage a freaking miracle mile.    

While it may sound like the Cons outweigh the Pros- they were all really just minor nuisances and didn't affect my stay too bad(except the last one) I'm just reporting all the things that happened during my stay that you should know about when making YOUR decision. Besides, I'm telling you,  I had a BLAST staying at Planet Hollywood.",16,10,8

Crowd: Young and fun!

Location: Probably the best location on the strip!--Close to the airport, across from City Center and Cosmo (LOVE)...pretty much, in the heart of all the action

Shopping: The Miracle Mile shops are attached to the hotel, so it's the perfect place to go to without even having to step outside

It used to be the Aladdin and is still in transition, so expect long lines and basically no customer service (I called the front desk and housekeeping three times and no one would ever answer.) A lot of the decor is still from the Aladdin, not sure why they haven't done a major overhaul to theme the place out. They have updated the bedspreads (no more fugly prints) and put in a wall unit with a flatscreen in each room.
However, we got a great rate on a weeknight ($70\/night) and the hotel was clean, just not ""Hollywood cool"" or themed well like some of the other hotels on the strip. It was definitely the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in for the price we paid, which was a lot less than the high glamour hotels which surround you here. 
It's also connected to the Miracle Mile shops, has a large casino with a starbucks and lots of eating places right off of it.
Beware: you will get hit up for time shares for the new Hollywood towers that are being built. Free tickets to a show in exchange for a timeshare presentation--guess it depends on how much you value your time.

I would recommend if you just want a place to crash and want a clean, comfortable, quiet room and want to be within walking distance of everything on the strip. If you are looking for a high-service resort experience, look elsewhere.

I always hit up PH whenever I'm in Vegas - the mall has stores within my price range and a Fat Tuesdays. The casino has a young hip vibe but not douchey, and of course, EARL OF SANDWICH. However, this is my first time staying here.

Upon checking in, I like to do the '20 Dollar Trick' when I check into Vegas hotels. Sandwich a $20 between your ID and credit card and the front desk staff will upgrade you to a better room. Don't do this because it never works contrary to all the success stories I've read online. All you gotta do is ask politely. The lady hooked it up a strip view room since we originally booked a mountain view room. It was a great view of NYNY, City Center, and the Bellagio Fountains.

The room was pretty nice. We got the Dragnet room (movie starring Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks) so there was memorabilia everywhere in the room. We had some issues with the plumbing and there were nicks and stretches on the desks and closets, but that's nothing too big to cry about. 

We got the room right off the elevator so you can hear the elevators through the walls, but if you're a deep sleeper it's not a problem. The pool is pretty okay. On weekends, they turn it into a Wet Republic\/Rehab place, but on weekdays it's a regular ol pool.

With their location right in the middle of the strip, PH is definitely a place to consider when staying in Vegas.

The Duke of Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino",2,1,2

I was skeptical to begin with since it didn't seem very reliable.. I already knew something was going to get me upset.

Well, I was right, I am sitting in the lobby waiting for check-in.  I'm not surprised to find such long lines of people, but getting to the lobby itself is just a huge hassle.  Maybe it was because I've never stayed here before and didn't know where to go, but to get to the lobby it took 2 elevator trips that doesn't even directly lead you to the lobby.  Since they chose not to valet (which was a horrible idea as well), we walked through the Miracle Mile shopping area carrying our heavy bags.

You definitely get what you pay for, and you can tell just by looking at the crowd and the lines during registration.  Loud children crying, jumping around, with no parents to supervise them.  Kids throwing water bottles and running in circles.

I haven't seen the rooms yet, but even the nicest suite wouldn't earn this place more than 3 stars from me.

Room service was DELICIOUS! The menu could add some additional items and variety. The food was delicious and presented beautifully, and room service was prompt (approx. 45 min. typical for a Vegas hotel). I had the pleasure of having Lillie bring room service several times and she was a delight. The entire staff was very pleasant and helpful. 

The room I stayed in was beautiful, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was quite large. I loved the spa tub and the walk in shower. 

The employees behind the desks at Valet and the Bell Desk were a little short and dismissive when I checked out.

Vegas casinos always have some ingenious ways to get you to stay and gamble, further parting you from your hard earned money.  They ply you with free alcohol (albeit rather weak), lavish buffets, headliner shows, and if you are degenerate enough - free rooms.  Planet Hollywood Casino takes this to another level.  What better way to distract you from your concentration at the blackjack table than by situating scantily clad go-go dancers right in front of you.  I don't even want to think of how many hands I effed up because of them.  I was like a kid with ADHD who had just emptied his last bottle of Ritalin.  On top of that, many of the dealers are attractive women dressed in lingerie.  I might as well just donate my money into a drop box. There aren't a whole lot of gaming tables here, but who is complaining when you have go - go dancers. Slots and video poker are found throughout in relatively smaller amount.  The games seem to be some of the older ones. But the odds on these seem fairly good as I came up on them.

Hotel - 3 stars
There are 2 very interesting things about the standard rooms here.  One is that each room is a movie theme.  Mine was Independence Day.  They have some piece of memorabilia in the room for that movie.  Ours was a skirt that some lady wore...we could not turn off the light illuminating it and I would wake up in the middle of the night with a lit up khaki skirt staring me in the face.  The other is that there is no main light switch that controls the lights in the room.  So I found myself going to each and every lamp to turn them off.  Big plus is the tub in the bathroom is large.  But the ghetto factor comes in when some of the toiletries they give you have the Paris Hotel label on them.

But with Gordon Ramsey Burgr, the Miracle Mile Shops, Pink's and the Earl of Sandwich, PH makes for a decently valued stay that is solidly middle class and won't break your bank.",1,0,0

Always ask for a strip view. We ended up getting a great view of the pools and the Bellagio Fountains...beautiful.

The crowd here is younger and hipper which helps with the pool situation. 

I ended up in a bikini contest, did the splits...but couldn't compete with the girls who were 10 years younger than me,

The location is part of the best hotels on the south side of the strip....its next to NY, Paris, and Bellagio. 

It use to be the Aladdin and still had some of the same design. Each room is decorated with objects from a movie.

It had plenty of room for one person, and was very clean. Modern enough, large flat panel TV, plenty of hanger\/drawer space.  The bathroom was oddly sized (large open space in the middle) in proportion to the rest of the room. Overall, I was very pleased with the room, given some of the other reviews I read beforehand. Weeknight rates were dirt cheap. 

All I can really fault the room for is a light fixture in the bathroom that buzzed when on. I also wasn't crazy about the design of the shower head; it hangs a bit low, and I bumped it with my head a few times. Really, that's it.

The location is right in the middle of everything. Right across from the new Cosmopolitan, City Center, and Bellagio. There is a Deuce Bus stop right in front.


I found the staff to be very helpful and outgoing. No problems there.

I did like how this property seems to attract a younger, energetic crowd, but not overly pretentious. At least by LV standards.

It was great having the Miracle Mile shops attached, for those of us who don't like spending $300 on a pair of pants, etc.

PH doesn't charge a ""resort fee"" but high speed internet will cost you about $14 per 24-hr period. There is another wireless provider that charges $10\/24 hrs, but it was very slow and kept timing out every time I left my computer for more than a few minutes. I'd suggest paying up for PH's internet, which worked great. If you only need to print a boarding pass, etc. the staff in the business center will often let you use the computers without charging if you're only going to take a few minutes.

The casino had a large variety of slots, and there were plenty of open machines, even during peak times. The casino floor didn't seem as smoky as some of the others on the strip. I enjoyed playing at some of the tables in the ""Pleasure Pit"" where the dealers are barely-dressed attractive young women, and similar women dance on poles.  Drink service was timely at both the tables and machines. Table minimums were mostly $10 on weeknights and $15 on weekend nights.

As for the restaurants, I'll review Strip House separately. I had breakfast at Planet Dailies, and while the food was great, it was expensive and I felt the buffet was a better value. Speaking of the buffet, you can pay one price ($40-$45?) and have 24-hour access. There is a Starbucks right off of the casino floor.

The casino layout is a bit confusing, especially if you've had a few. Expect to walk in circles for a while trying to find your way out or the restaurant you are looking for. Then again, casinos don't want you to leave, so I can understand the purpose of the layout.

PH gets bonus amusement points for the asian hooker that solicited me while I was playing a slot machine at 1am! Like a good little boy, I turned her offer down, though.

It's all pretty much middle of the road. It's nothing to rave about, yet I don't know that there's anything to really complain about. I loved its location on the strip, which puts you in a very convenient position to reach most anything of note in a short walk. 

I had unexpectedly been offered a free rental vehicle and parked in the garage. I never drove it again until departure, and I was glad for that. The walk from the garage to check-in is ludicrous. Winding through the Miracle Mile Shops with luggage in tow was an annoyance, to say the least. Not to mention the inherent difficulties of the property floor plan itself, which had me twisted for the entire stay. 

The room was booked for me and I chose to upgrade to a larger room with a view- which is something I'll always do in Vegas. It was a great choice because I was given an excellent end of hall panoramic of the Paris balloon and tower next door and The Bellagio fountains across, and I couldn't watch them enough. Room 2038 was an Independence Day film theme and, although not luxurious, was very adequate and sufficiently tidy. The king bed allowed a great reclined view up the strip. The tv was oddly placed to the side of the bed. I turned the chairs at the window to enjoy a beverage and the view often throughout the stay. In consideration of the huge variances of room rates along the strip, I feel that I paid a very fair rate for the quality of the experience. I briefly negotiated the upgrade and felt that it was fair, as well.

Again, the floor plan had me wandering far more than I wanted just to find my way out or about. I've stayed in probably a dozen different Vegas properties and usually have my bearings by the second day- not here. The dining choices offered a nice variety. Planet Dailies was a waste for both food and service. I wasn't crazy about the buffet and it seemed that I was probably not alone in that opinion. The food quality and selection were adequate and there was never a line.

I walked everywhere during my stay and, again, for that I really appreciated the location. 

On my nickel, I'll usually stay at Bellagio. But, if I were to find myself in position to have to consider Planet Hollywood again, I would be fine staying there.",1,0,0

Though this place isn't entirely non-smoking like the Vdara, the lobby, Starbucks, and the room elevators can be accessed from the ground floor without having to inhale second-hand smoke. The rest of the shops are upstairs, but being newly renovated, doesn't smell as bad as older properties.

The rooms are fairly clean - and let's face it - high volume areas like Las Vegas are bound to have dirty sheets from time to time. Ours were clean but despite the recent renovation, the place is starting to deteriorate in certain areas. The carpet outside wasn't installed properly and it has clearly deformed. Some of the paint has small nicks and chips. But again, minor details, and overall everything was reasonably clean.

Only downside that doesn't change is that the rooms are dark. They need more light fixtures closer to the door area and another light fixture over the TV cabinet or something.

The second downside, probably the largest, is that wifi is $14\/day with one device included in the resort fee. One Wi-Fi enabled device per day is just tacky but at least we had a mobile hotspot.

And the last downside is that for our Hollywood memorabilia, we had a wedding dress  parked right next to the TV. Kind of creepy, kind of weird, but OK I guess.

For all the downsides with how small the place is, the shops are budget friendly and there is an Earl of Sandwich open 24 hours. And if the place is too small, being placed right in the middle of the strip means that you can walk over right next door to the half dozen other properties to do whatever else you want. 

The buffet's not really worth it here though, go to Paris or the Bellagio or the Cosmopolitan or Caesar's Palace.

When we first started staying there it was Aladdin, so we have been customers for many years and have always had a wonderful experience.  The hotel is in the middle of the strip so it is very convenient to walk all of the strip (which we do) and come back by PH to have a small rest if needed.  The rooms are  spacious as are the bathrooms, and have always had no problems with them being perfectly clean.

NOW THE PROBLEMS...we go twice a year and the past few times there have been two BIG aggravations.  First if you happen to get there  before 3:00 and some planes do get your there early, you have to either pay to check in early or walk around and kill time until 3:00, which means you have to pay more to check your bags.  Of course then when it gets to  3:00 the line to check in is very long.  Which it wasn't when we got there.   We used to get there  around 1:00 p.m. way after check out time which is 11:00 and were able to check in our room right then.

Also, you now have to pay $22.00 a day per person for the ""resort fee"" even though many of us do not use it, we ended up paying $40.00 something a day for NOTHING!!!   I can see if they want to charge someone to use their extra facilities, then take their credit card number or or have them use their room card to use these different and charge them if they use them.  Don't push this charge on everyone if we are not going to use them.  I think that is very much a rip off.

Not the least of which is it's location & proximity to other hotels, sights & shopping centers in the area. The Cosmopolitan is across the street, Paris is next door & Caesar's is not too far a walk... City Center is just behind Cosmopolitan. I like staying there cause it's about a 10 min drive to the airport. It's just a quick shoot down Harmon then a right on Paradise and you're at McCarran. I like the fact that the Miracle Mile Shops are located at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. I LOVE the fact that they have an Earl of Sandwich on the property. It's my favorite sandwich in all of Vegas and many that I know have the same sentiments. I like gambling at the Pleasure Pit, although a bit distracting, with their beautiful dealers. It's kinda like gambling at a nightclub but there's no dress code.

I like staying at PH because it's a young casino resort.... You don't have snobby rich folks staying there. And believe me, my friends & I have stayed in some of the best... and less than best hotels in Las Vegas. It's a young adult crowd and I like that. Staff at PH have always been super cool from the front desk, housekeeping, valet & the ladies of the aforementioned Pleasure Pit.

The rooms are pretty standard.... They have modern amenities. Being that it is a Planet Hollywood hotel, the rooms usually are adorned with some sort of movie memorabilia whether it's something from Batman, Terminator or some other theatrical release. It makes for a nice touch and ties everything together.... People forget this was the old Aladdin Hotel and for a while some elements like the carpet stayed the same but it's unmistakably PH now. The beds are comfortable, the linen is soft, the showers are modern & nice, the doors & cabinets have a dark modern finish... a small desk to write and make phone calls on are in the room and of course a small couch and ottoman are provided.

Valet is fairly quick with retrieving your car & super friendly but can fill to capacity towards the later hours. Usually not a problem for hotel guests but it can be an issues for others. I've never had to self-park at PH so I have no idea where or how far the walk is. 

Minus one star because the expansive pool deck could be so much better. I know it's not on the ground floor so it cannot be crazy like other hotels but there is just so much deck space and 2 small pools at the either end.

Although the signage and some of the decor is ""PH"" branded, there is still a 75% presence of the old Aladdin roots, especially in the hotel rooms.

Once they've finished making the updates, it will be interesting to visit again and see how they've pulled this place together. One especially important place I hope they focus on is the pool. As it currently stands, the pool is a disappointing place to be. You follow the signs to the pool and think, ""where is it?"" Then you find that it's hidden behind an expanse of concrete deck that serves no purpose other than to house empty lounge chairs. You walk toward the back corners of the deck, up the stairs and ""aha!"" there they are -- two small pools. There is way too much wasted space on the pool deck that leaves little room for what people are looking for -- lounging poolside.

If they transition in a smart way that keeps guest needs in mind, and if you have the patience to deal with their growing pains, this could be a solid hotel option on the strip.",0,0,0

Basic pros: location, price, easy parking, and near Miracle Mile.

Why this place deserves five stars and beyond: Service!!!

The valet attendants were friendly and attentive. The line to check-in (on a Friday at 4:00pm) moved quick. And when we reached the front of the line, we met Yasuko, who, without giving too much details, heard about our special occasion and, without hesitation, went to see what she can ""do for you""... came back with comp upgrades. Again, this is mid-April on a weekend (sure it's only one-night), but she was so easy-going about it. Didn't make a big fuss, not slipping a twenty, etc.... 

Then, the manager Vickie, came by and was so friendly and personable... made us feel super comfortable and upgraded us again into really nice suites next to each other with the perfect Strip views! Again, no big fuss, was really interested in our reasons to be at the resort for that one day, and just was super cool about everything. Bring her a Starbucks coffee if you were do decide to see her. And wink. 

So MAJOR KUDOS to Yasuko and Vickie... and yes, she said yes. :)",3,1,1

Super good buffet!
Visited here twice in a couple of days, 1st day- everything was absolutely perfect and we ate so much that we ended up going to bed at 10 pm, never making it back out after what was to be a ""short nap""..lol

Second visit, a bit disappointing, we were left waiting in line in an almost empty restaurant, for over 25 minutes while the 1 (!) cashier was chatting it up with other guests. This was awful but what was worse was that the buffet room was so cold that I was shaking the whole time through. I went to the rest room a couple of times and held my hands under hot water to warm up enough to be able to continue my meal.

I was wearing shorts and a tank,leaving my sweater at the hotel, like an idiot, but still.. I can imagine skinny people, like myself, (and children) being cold in here..

Please push the thermostat up a notch, or we will all have to walk around with layers of clothes on the 100+ degree strip, ever ready..

Great food though! :)",0,0,0

Where do I begin...I have plenty to say about my overall stay.  Due to hotel overbooking and not being able to accomodate guests with reservations, instead of calling or placing us in another HARRAH'S property (ie. Ceasars, Ballys, etc.), they expected us to just ""deal"" with the problem and wait until the next morning.

1) Checking in late almost midnight, waited 1 hour in line to find out that we were placed in a room next door to a party with base pounding against the wall practically vibrating from next door.  This was UNACCEPTABLE, so went back downstairs to complain to wait another 1 hour to finally get moved to the Towers side which was really nice.

Note: Manager in the late evening did not want to properly handle the problem and left it for the morning manager to deal with.  I will be nice NOT to leave their name here.  Let's just say he was properly dealt with the next morning.

2) Next morning had to DEAL with the problem AGAIN which the manager in the morning was MUCH BETTER to work with than from the night before.  We were pleased to hear that we would be upgraded to a panoramic suite which was unexpected but at least made our stay much better.  I can't explain about the Superman costumes and memorabilia that was placed throughout the suite, but who cares?  At least the room had 2 beds, it was QUIET, and could finally get a good nights sleep.

Side note: DON'T USE the coffee makers\/quick water heaters and check the insides first...apparently ours was rusted and seemed a bit moldy.  Either bring your own or ask for hot water downstairs.  Also, why aren't the towels nice and fluffy?  They don't even have a ""bounce"" smell to them.  It's as if they just shoved them in with clorox bleach and the towels were rough on skin.  

3) Overall service: DON'T SET HIGH EXPECTATIONS...Apparently upper management can't seem to hire appropriate and intelligent staff to handle the front desk or overall CUSTOMER SERVICE.  This include the concierge in the MALL AREA.  What is going on with this hotel?  I used to stay all the time but after this visit....sorry PH, but I will give another Harrah's property a try.  There are just too many options...management needs to get it together otherwise this property will change names once again.",8,1,1

I got a suite upgrade upon check-in. We were there for a sort of whirlwind weekend, and so spent an entire day here in the resort without ever having to leave. There are so many stores and restaurants that you can walk around forever and never see daylight. The rooms were relatively comfortable, and we enjoyed the upgrade on the suite we got. 

This wouldn't be the first place I thought of as romantic, but we went with a group of friends, and part of this weekend was to celebrate that I got engaged. The rest was my friends' birthdays. I did tell them I was there for a romantic weekend, so I imagine that's why I got the big sexy tub and the Showgirls themed decor. It was fun and ridiculous. I do have a couple of complaints. Obviously, this being Vegas, there is debauchery happening at all hours in the hall, and you are going to hear that. People running down the halls and yelling at each other isn't unusual. We might have contributed to that noise with our pre-going out, getting ready parties, so I can't hate on that too much. But that brings me to my next point. It's fairly common for hotels to have some kind of speakers where you can hook up a phone or laptop to listen to music. Planet Hollywood only has a basic clock radio with no AV hookups. We also couldn't hook anything up to the TV. That would be a really basic upgrade that would infinitely add to the comfort of the rooms.  

We were required to pay a ""resort fee"" for $22 a day that includes one device per day internet and two gym passes. We did not use the gym, and would've preferred to pay the $13 (still steep) for internet instead, but we were told it was mandatory. The cell service for both Verizon and AT&T were really awful in all of our rooms, and the conspiracy theorist in me feels like they throttle it some way so that you'll buy the internet. I had a really difficult time accessing data or getting texts in the hotel, and then once we hit the Casino and Miracle Mile, it was at full strength. 

On Sunday, the pool had a DJ spinning, and there was fun in the air. But it was also really loud. Like difficult to hear each other talking even though we were on the other side of the pool. Most people didn't seem to have a problem, because people were mostly just sunbathing. The service was good, and the servers came by several times to check on us. 

It was definite Vegas experience, and we enjoyed every boozy minute of our celebratory weekend. It's not the classiest place, but if you're looking for an easy, very stereotypically Vegas experience, this one is convenient and right in the middle of the action.",2,1,1

After staying at almost all properties in paradise, we decided to give the Planet Hollywood a try. We did like the casino, and the miracle mile already, so why not.

We wish we didn't.

Our stay included two adults, and one child (9 years old)

Upon arrival and assignment of booked room, we immediately notice the strong odour of Marihuana in the room. Given the late hour
of arrival, we decided to bring this situation to management's attention in the morning. However, while getting our nine year old to bed,
we now noticed footprints on the linen. Upon further inspection, we also found substantial bloodstains (!!!) on the same linen. After asking
housekeeping to take care of the issue, a supervisor showed, and confirmed (1) the strong smell of Marihuana, (2) the footprints, and (3) bloodstains.

The linen was changed after midnight, and next morning we've tried to rectify the situation with management (Dave). While leaving the room, we
noticed someone had thrown up right in front of the room, and next to a tremendous amount of dirty dishes that had accumulated over night.

We were met at the front desk with an unbelievable arrogance and ignorance; the manager on duty was not helpful at all, and only after 
insisting in a new room assignment, we'd been promised a new room. I took another visit to the front desk mid afternoon, and more
pursuance to actually get a new room. When finally assigned a new room, and ready to move, we found (1) the throw-up still hadn't been cleaned,
(2) still dirty dishes along the entire floor from elevators to room, and (3) a maid strongly discouraging us not to have our child enter the
room due to the strong smell of Marihuana. No kidding.

The newly assigned room worked out, however to our complete and utter horror, while boarding the elevator with our nine year old, we noticed
a used condom on the floor of the elevator.

Bringing this issue to the manager's on duty attention (Romel), we were met with ignorance and arrogance easily worsening the experience we had we Dave. The manager explained
that this was not his problem, and the hotel did not have any responsibility for its customers actions (!!!). 

Here's the customer approved answer: thank you for letting us know, we'll take care of it. 

These guys don't care. The problem is not the staff, it's management. They don't give a flying hun.

I'm not sure if they were real, but there were movie props behind glass in our room. Unfortunately, our room felt like it was ""the worst it could get.""

On first impression, we thought we entered someone else's room since the TV was on and the luggage rack was standing open. The second thing I noticed was stains on the curtains from what I can only imagine as a ghost of someone's projectile vomit. Ugh...

The bathroom seemed spacious since there was a fancy tub, but the shower looked no better than a community shower. I spied a random pubic hair on the tile missed by housekeeping and there was virtually no water pressure in the shower. I had to endure an additional 10 minutes to get clean. While doing so, I kept hoping this was a bad dream. The bedsheets were scratchy, the bath towels were the strangest dimensions that I thought I could wrap myself twice in them. Overall, the room just felt dirty.

For the price of the room and location of the hotel, I hoped it would be decent, but it really wasn't. The hotel hallways felt like we had taken a walk inside Britney Spears with the pink\/black decor. Lastly, our toilet stopped flushing and we decided this was a sign that we needed to check out 2 days early. I don't think I could endure the living situation for what seems like poor maintenance or the aftermath of someone else's hard-partying in Vegas.

November 10th I brought my sister here for a weekend of concerts and fun and we both left angry and disappointed. From the rude Valet on Friday, to the rude host at Diamond Check in to the filthy room. It looked like someone washed a coffee pot in the shower, the carpet was dirty, the AC stayed on even at 80 it was 60 so shut it off so no air in room stuffy. The double bathroom doors were hung not to meet the center and the gap was so large that you could accidentally see people shower or bathe. The only employees who wanted to smile was the Reward Booth and cocktail waitresses. I had Starbucks down by Diamond Lounge yell at me for being in the diamond line without a card ready to show her before she would wait on me. She ignored me and a gentleman in the regular line she just yelled at and made another woman in the Diamond\/7 star line mad with her attitude. She skipped half my order and when I went to pay with comps she said I had no comps on my card for $14 when I had over a $1000 in comps. So how are you going to pay? I was totally embarrassed  I didn't use my free food comps that you bill to your room because the last time I left Paris they charged my credit card after I left.
What has happened to this Change of Resorts. I am switching to the ""M"" and Wynn and my employees and family hate it so much that none of them made Diamond this year. They even in October did a last minute change so Diamond Members needed to earn 10,000 more points in two months to use the Diamond Lounge complimentary in 2018. They only had to earn 15k for 1 year now need 10k more. It is a true disappointment and I am not normally a complainer but the last two employees even at check out had attitudes. Starbucks server and then the Valet told us we were lucky he was helping us because he had a torn muscle in his shoulder. We didn't ask him to lift our luggage and we had already tipped him.

The price we got for the room for a weekend in August via Expedia was pretty good, especially when all you really need is a place to sleep and get ready throughout the day when you're in Vegas, right? 

But when we parked at the parking structure and checked in, little did we know that it was quite a walk from the parking structure to the lobby. And we walked along Miracle Mile, remnants of what was the Aladdin were still very visible. It's also visible in the hallways when you're walking to your room. 

We booked a Hollywood Hip room and was quite disappointed when we saw our room. The website made it seem more spacious that it really was but the bathroom was very spacious, I'll admit. The king size bed was pretty comfortable. But the quality of the towels and washcloths weren't all that great. My boyfriend wanted to keep the washcloths since they were purple. But every time I look at them and feel them, I can't help but shake my head at how thin they are.

And it's pretty convenient to have some of my favorite shops in the Miracle Mile, like H&M, Metropark, Urban Outfitters, and bebe, when the Fashion Show Mall is a little far to walk from PH. 

Another gripe for me was the walking distance on the Strip in relation to other surrounding hotels, it's a bit of a walk from the Venetian and a bit of a walk from MGM Grand. But Bellagio's pretty close, practically just across the street.

I booked the room including a continental breakfast which turned out to be a $18 a day credit at the hotels Starbucks.
The check-inn guy told me is was $9 per person, but when I told him there were three of us (having paid $24 a day for my son) he changed his story to $18 max per room per day. Turned out to be used for coffee and pastry only....(fruit and yoghurt turned up on bill)
Arriving at 1.30 PM after a long trip from Europe, early checkin was another $17 on the bill.
Al together a $44 a night special deal added up to a total bill of over $400 for three nights....

Location is great on the Strip next to many of big resorts.

casino was also very nice.

Will go somewhere else next time.",0,0,0

My family and I got 2 rooms (hollywood hip standard room) on the 23rd floor which was the top level for the south elevators.  During check in we received a smoking room because it was the only one available but they said some people don't smoke in the room.  The room was definitely bad but to be expected considering it was a smoking room anyways.

Other than that our rooms were clean and housekeeping always came late in the day around 2pm or later.  We did have some problems in just one room where the bathroom lights turned off.  We called maintenance and they told us to press the reset button. Three calls later they finally worked but we also told maintenance that our shower head had no water pressure.  Within an hour they had someone up to fix it and it was a lot better.  The hotel room was spacious but had absolutely no drawer space, the bathrooms are quite large and having a separate bath and shower was definitely nice.  The toilet had a door but had no fan or light switches from inside.  The pool sucks so stay elsewhere if that's a priority.

This hotel is no good.  Seriously, spend the extra $20-$40 a night to stay at a better hotel.  The first ""non-smoking"" room we were put in smelled like an ashtray.  After we let them know, they informed us they would deodorize the room and it would take an hour for it to work.  After this inconvenience we went back to the room and it still reeked of the inside of a cigarette.  After another complaint, they put us in a new room that was on the opposite side of the hotel.  Which would have been fine if they maybe sent up a bell hop to help us repack and move into another room, but they didn't.  Another awful aspect of this place was that for some reason the AC didn't work in the halls or the elevators.  Which was horrible because we would wait 15-20 minutes for an elevator.  Anyway, when we went to complain about these inconveniences the front desk assistant manager was rude and condescending and basically told us there was nothing he was going to do for us.  He finally issued a $50 credit for food and beverage, but it was after much arguing back and forth with him.  All in all the hotel itself is terrible, beds are uncomfortable, room smelled and was dirty, and the staff was rude.  DO NOT STAY HERE, I promise it is worth it to spend the extra money at a better hotel with nicer accommodations...",0,0,0

I had a line of credit with the casino. The first time I came down, I asked the cage how should I pay and they said to mail them a check. I mailed them a check for $3,000 which they cashed but they also automatically drafted another $3,000. This caused my checking account to bounce causing all sorts of problems and fees. After much effort, the casino finally agreed not to charge me the extra fees for the returned check but would not repay me for all the fees I was charged on my end by my bank. I sent an email to corporate but received no reply.

Fast forward a few months, I decide to give PH another chance. I book a room and proceed to the casino. I go to a table only to find out that my line of credit has been cancelled due to my check bouncing last time. Of course I did not bring any cash to gamble so I had to take money out of my credit card incurring over $100 in fees. I complained to my host and to collections why I was not notified that my line of credit was cancelled. I ask them if I can get any kind of credit for all the fees I was charged. They tell me to pound sand. I will never gamble at PH ever again despite the really awesome gambling atmosphere.

We opened the doors to find an amazing common area, including huge plasma, bumper pool table, fooseball table, and great comfortable seats.

My friend chased the guy and the thief thew my wallet back and got away with $100. (Thank goodness!) I was really disappointed that security didn't help to chase and only showed up 5 mins after. 

That's not all. Their dealers were rude to me. Not all but it just takes 1 bad apple to change your opinion.

The self parking is a little bit of a walk, but that helps incorporate some work out into the Vegas experience, it can't be more than a quarter mile at most which is five minutes. Check in was fine, can't wave the resort fee, but that's ok considering they let you hook up two devices to their wifi which has a decent connection. Our room was a little wreck-tastic, some dings and scrapes on the furniture, but come on it's Vegas what do you expect for Sin City. 

Why you should stay here: Central location, but not obnoxiously popular like its neighbor Paris hotel. Britney, you need to see her! the Spice Market Buffet! M mall which has Panda Express and a Vladimir Kush gallery. It's across Aria :) also near the ghetto oasis, .99 tall boys on the strip whoa! PH used to be the Aladdin hotel (which was my favorite, sad they closed it), but they kept parts of Agribah at the shops.  

We had the buffet of buffet pass which was $60 after tax on a weekday, supposedly the prices go up on the weekend or holidays. You can use the buffet pass up to five times on a handful of buffets within 24 hours, it averages to $20 a meal if you use it three times, we managed to use it five times! We only went to Spice Market and Le Village. Don't forget to tip your server! Spice Market is huge, they're open until 11pm and there's never a line (weekdays that is)! There's an Asian section, Mexican, Middle Eastern, Seafood, Soups, Salads, Desserts, Italian and American (prime rib, ham roasts, turkey etc). We grabbed dinner after the Britney show, classic Vegas madness. 

While most will disagree with me that this is a good hotel, I suggest coming here and seeing it for yourself! 

Tips: Check out the Container Park which is on Fremont and 7th just three blocks from the casino madness. Also check out Neon Museum, book your tour in advance. Downtown Las Vegas has a lot to offer and is in a way more interesting than the strip. The strip will always be more fun due to all the shows, clubs bars and gambling... but if you're a graphic designer, artist or just into that stuff then you'll appreciate downtown specifically the container park and NEON MUSEUM.",8,0,0

No outlets by the bed, had to use the ones by the window to charge my phone, that was slightly annoying. We were next to the elevator so I could hear it go up and down, but I used a White Noise app on my phone to drown it out.

They did not have enough space around the pool for anybody so everyone had to pick a chair down on the main level then walk up and down every time we wanted to go in the pool or hot tub. 

Planet Hollywood is connected to the Miracle Mile Shops and Restaurants which is nice because you are connected to a variety of shops and food. 

I would say the hotel is definitely geared more towards the 20 somethings then an older crowd because the casino, bars, and restaurants are pretty connected. That can get loud and some people may not like that. 

My only complaint with the hotel was that the housekeeping staff was very rude. Now I know that I am sure they do not love what they are doing but the few requests we did have were nothing major. We asked for a few extra towels in each room because all the rooms had four women staying so two towels would not be enough. They acted like what we asked for was the biggest deal in the world and were quite rude about it when they bought the towels up. The only complaint I had is that they misbooked two of our rooms and then acted like we had to deal with one king bed and a rollout for four people. That was rather rude and impossible situation. Lucky one of the ladies I went with found someone to fix the situation. They were upgrade to a suite style since they ran out of the other rooms.",1,1,0

I really liked it.  The table games have decent limits and the waitresses are not slow like at some casinos (even when it is crowded which is most of the time).  They have several different table areas and a very nice centrally located bar.  Smart of Harrah's to snap this place up when they could.  

like the Hard Rock it can be loud, it can also have a much younger crowd.  Unlike the Hard Rock - it appears to have a much more mature crowd (with a few exceptions here and there).  Like most casinos they have the standard slots, though I didn't play any this trip.  Unfortunately for them they do have one Starbucks that is SLOW.  The workers here should take some tips from the waitresses in the casino.  They would make more in tips and they would keep the customers happy.",1,0,0

If you are driving, it's one of the worst hotels to stay in. For some reason when the Alladin remade itself as Planet Hollywood, they removed drive-in access from the Strip; you can only drive in from Harmon Ave. Self-park makes you walk all the way through the Miracle Mile Shops; Valet is typically clogged up and slow even when it isn't (though recently they've become a lot more friendly and flexible).

However, if you're NOT driving, it's fantastically located just a walking bridge away from City Center and Bellagio, and walking distance to Paris, Ballys, Caesars Palace and Flamingo. 

Check in is on the level below the casino, and once you have your keys, you can take a nearby elevator straight to your room; no huffing bags through the casino. The standard rooms are about average size, with a good amount of space and lots of lighting options. Bathrooms have a glass shower stall (good water pressure),  separate deep soaking tub and private toilet. Beds are comfortable, there's a good sized desk and closets, flatscreen, and the rooms all have cute Hollywood artifacts. I'd rate them overall a strong 4 star level. 

I've also gotten to experience a couple of the suites, and they are honestly among the best around. Sleek, sexy, cool. The ones on the end of the hallway (forget the name) with curved windows, and a peek-through view from the spa tub are my favorite. Any of them would be a great choice for a bachelor party wkd--best views of Bellagio, City Center, and the Eiffel Tower.

Of the dining here, my favorite for dinner would be Strip House, a solid steak house with sexy atmosphere (great bar, too). They make a fantastic burger, but you have to ask for it. Koi next door also has a great lounge, though it's not my favorite sushi on the Strip. On the casino floor, Earl of Sandwich (see seperate post) is one of the best bargains here. The coffee shop (forget the name) is also solid, but not cheap. And the center bar is comfortable and cool. 

Peepshow is the rare topless revue with actual talented dancers, some production value, and a story line. It's one of the best choices for couples in that regard, and hey: Holly Madison. Need I say more?

Miracle Mile Shops are a decent mid-range mall, including H&M, Bebe, Ben Sherman, Frederick's, other fashion and some tourist shops. The Hawaiian-based ABC shops are a good call for travel needs\/souvenirs at reasonable markups. There are a variety of moderate eateries here--the only one I've tried, the Italian trattoria across from V Theatre, was actually very reasonable and totally acceptable. 

The pool deck is nothing special--in fact, it's particularly unimpressive compared to most of the other Strip resorts of its size. I don't think I've ever seen the exercise room here, which probably means they charge too much to use it. They have a Mandara spa here with an almost ridiculous array of available services. The facility itself is large but needs updating. I think the nightclub Prive is in transition, so it's hard for me to comment; I love the space, but the last time I was there, I didn't love the music or the vibe.",1,0,0

Oh and of course, there are always chances of profit (which is not possible at an actual strip club) but I wouldn't count on it.

Just to set things straight I dont stare at the strippers because I'm not a perv or nothing. They were just totally dancing in the area I wanted to gamble in. How annoying!

There are Hollywood posters & memorabilia in the rooms, but aside from the modern look & occasional crystal chandelier things and the occasionally skimpy women that serve drinks, it doesn't feel a lot like Hollywood to me - Which I don't care about but is worth noting.  The hotel & casino wifi was fast enough to stream a TV show to my phone with very few hiccups.

Only a few quirks we experienced: No wall switch controlled the only 2 lights in the bedroom, as the switches were on the lamps themselves. Calling the front desk Sunday morning at 10:30am resulted in a failed operator transfer and a 7 minute wait before we could ask for a late checkout, which we were granted.  We were not comped an upgrade for our first visit, as they claimed they couldn't because we already selected a room type, but all the staff there were very courteous.

As mentioned by one of the Yelpers, you literally have to walk half the mall to get to the lobby. Also, it took us about half hour to get a parking. 

2- check in line was very long. Apparently no one was at the desk until one lady complained. Apparently she had to argue with one of the staff to get the check in started. While waiting for our turn, there were people that cut lines and the receptionist allowed it. No, they were not VIPs because we were at the general check ins. Shame on you! 

3- No fridge, no kettle, no water bottle, no microwave here. You could probably request one and pay for it coz i saw one mini fridge outside one of the rooms on my floor. 

4- the resort fee is double from the Venetian. This resort fee is mandatory and it includes gym & day spa and wifi for two. However, wifi is VERY weak. Only works in my room. Not any other places within the hotel. Sucks. Fitness center is pretty big. Day spa is lovely but lack of lounge chairs. Oh, to get to the spa it is really awkward to walk between people who are gambling in the middle of the area on M floor(if you are from North elevators). 

5- we got two queen beds and one of the queen bed's headboard is dusty. So obviously we chose to sleep on the other bed. Water pressure was low. 

6- our entrance light in the room does not work. The room is dark and depressing. 

7- somebody must have kicked or pushed the toilet door really hard before us because there is a hole on the wall. 

8- had to ride on the lift in total darkness at one time. Dont know what happened.

When I brought all these issues to the guest service manager's attention they comped us 1 night resort fees ($35) and gave us $50 food and beverage credit, in reality only getting us a few coffees due to the fact that the restaurants and Starbucks prices are outrageous. So that's all we got for our 5 night stay.  They did offer me a room change but my husband didn't want to lug our luggage around after they fixed the air and safe to only discover a new set of issues in a new room! I went back to guest services in person to speak with a manager about these issues and was told they were not available and they took my personal cell and I was told they would call me back this was on my forth day, well NOBODY called me! I gave two stars for the size of the room and the gentleman at check in was very nice and the employees that came to fix the safe and air were also very kind! Also I will attach some photos!",0,0,0

I made the reservations a few months before and asked if there was any way to reserve a themed room since all the rooms have their own movie or celebrity theme. My husband is a big Star Wars fan and I wanted to be sure we got that room. I was told that there was no was to reserve it but they would try by putting a note on my reservation. 

I week before my stay I called the front desk to confirm the reservation and talked to Sarah about my situation. She asked me to give her a few hours and she would see what she could do for me. I called back later that night and she was able to reserve the room I wanted. She had to look up the room number for the theme I wanted and there were 3,000 rooms to search. I felt soooo bad that she had to go to that much trouble but she was very pleasant and eager to help me with my husband's birthday surprise.

It was the lunch buffet, and we got 25% off just by walking up

They have the usual Vegas-International Fanfare: Mexican, Asian, American, Italian, Seafood, etc. etc.

If you are unsure about buffet food, just use my patented technique of getting whatever the hell you want and spitting out what tastes like ass instead of committing to eating the entire chunk of nasty food you lumped onto your plate-- that way you will only be eating the deliciousness you meant to serve up!

My sister and I go to Vegas once every couple of years. She lives in Baltimore, I live in Boston, so I meet her down in her neck of the woods and after Thanksgiving we get on a plane to Vegas, baby! We've stayed in many hotels here over the years. I heard good things about Planet Hollywood and wanted to give it a try. 

First of all, this place is DARK...even for Vegas. LOTS of dark wood panelling, and the main hotel is definitely beginning to look outdated despite renovations and the tower addition. Maybe my room would be different? Meh. Was it awful? No. Was it anything to write home about? No. It was clean (except the table..there was some type of residue...glass tables in a Vegas hotel room are just ASKING for trouble, if you know what I mean...I can't imagine the things housekeeping has to scrape off after a looonnggg night\/morning of partying). My sister's friend met us and she was obviously is a room that had NOT been renovated. Ay yai yai....I would def have asked to move if I were here. Striped walls and a mattress that was lopsided. Looked 20 years too late.

I'm not sure what it is, but even some of the hotels older than PH have a ""newer"" feel to them. Something feels kind of grimy about PH...maybe it has to do with all the dark wood panelling, but I can't say I was impressed with anything :(

I WILL say the location is EXCELLENT and very centralized to the strip- location wise you can't get much better. While I wouldn't *not* stay here if it was heavily discounted\/ or someone else was paying for it, I would not stay here again. Just my opinion! Nothing wonderful, but nothing bad. It's Vegas, so you want it to be exciting, which a lot of the other hotels do a good job with.",6,0,0

You know, I really like Planet Hollywood.  It's huge, the environment is really welcoming and they have the Pleasure Pit, which has surprisingly attractive dancers on poles behind the tables.  No better way to make men lose money than to distract them with their favorite vice.

Though I almost had to settle with 3 stars due to our last visit here.  We sat down at the video poker machines just to play long enough to get a free drink, but we ended up waiting *entirely* too long for a waitress to finally come by.  At most other casinos I'm usually not waiting for more than 10 minutes before I can get the attention of a waitress, but this was at least double that.  It made up for this when I got 4 Aces and won about $20, but when I tried to cash out the tickets were empty as well as the Guest Relations booth.  I was pretty over it by the time someone came by to get me my ticket, because god knows I wasn't leaving without it.

It was a bargain.  Under $100 with taxes for the total for both nights.

Once I checked in, I walked up to my room after finding it (this place is huge).  I was given the Die Hard\/Bruce Willis room and I loved the motif.  I am a huge Bruce Willis fan - how did they know?! 

The front desk was friendly and housekeeping staff did a great job tidying up the room while I was gone.

The bathroom was huge and I loved having a bathtub and a shower, not to mention a private toilet room.  Double beds - one for me and one for my stuff.

I found the valet and check-in very friendly, prompt, and courteous. The room was very well appointed and had a great touch with a display of a sword used in the movie ""Highlander"" in the bedroom. The bathroom was large and included a large tub and a separate shower.

I had some packages that were sent from my office which weighed a total of 50 Lbs. but they were very accommodating and they did make arrangements for the delivery to my room although it did cost $10, the service was nice. 

The buffet is excellent and you can find a long line for lunch\/dinner if you wait too long. They include a wide range of ethnic food ranging from: chinese, japanese, mediteranean, mexican, italian, and continental.

I get bored easily and found myself playing the only game I feel comfortable playing in a casino- Texas Hold em. No way am I going to play games where the casino has the advantage. I enjoy playing other players and in Vegas I always make some money playing poker against tourists and buzzed\/drunk players.

I am very impressed with their poker room. Although simply decorated, it does present an inviting atmosphere compared to most poker rooms in Vegas. The servers come by often to offere free drinks.

Prices are very reasonable at ~130\/night.  You could probably priceline it for less, but this location is great if you plan to party at Marquee (at Cosmopolitan) and have budgetary constraints.  Ph is right across the Cosmo, and I think I timed a walk from casino-to-Marquee under 10 minutes.  The Miracle Mile shops are also connected to Ph, and many people rave about Earl's (sandwich place -- can't miss it with the often-huge line).  And Pink's is downstairs too if you're craving a hot dog.  Walgreens is also next door if you needa grab supplies.

The rooms itself are updated and very nice.  It feels sleek, and I really have no criticisms for the price you pay.  Do note if you're on the West or East tower, cause that could save you an extra 15 minutes of walking (or 30 if you're buzzed\/drunk\/wasted).

I was impressed their Pleasure Pool had a live DJ too.  He wasn't one of the renowned DJ's headlining a big pool party like at EBC or Marquee, but he spun a good set when I was there.  The security (I hope he wasn't the head) was a bit of a douche, who didn't believe me when I said I bought the Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy (beer) there -- you can't bring in drinks.  He gave me a bit of a stare-down, and I repeated myself that I got it there and he could go check.  He did go check, but I don't recall him coming back to apologize for his rude approach.  Mike, on the other hand, was the dude at the counter inside who sold me those drinks, and he was very friendly.  Hope management gave two shits about this review, but it's Vegas... (they don't really).

Oh, and they even set up a beer pong table in front of the DJ (it was a large, empty space with so much potential too), which gave the pool a very college vibe (kinda like Palms Place).  I wish there were drunk co-eds with nip slips to go with it, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.

Since I go to Vegas monthly every summer, I sometimes get asked for suggestions on where to stay.  I say it really comes down to what you want to do, i.e. where you want to party.  I think traveling to and from the club(s) is one of the key factors on where you should book.  If you want to party at Marquee, Ph is a great choice for those on a budget (otherwise staying at Cosmo itself, or Aria or Bellagio is better).  If you want to party at XS, then you might wanna stay at Venetian.  Taxi queues as well as riding times can be killer, and you want to maximize the amount of enjoyment time on your trip.  I highly recommend booking a hotel room you can stumble back to, and Ph fits the bill with this regard, as well as a plethora of dining options.",2,1,1

1. Service sucks at valet (even if you don't drive around forever trying to even find it)

2. Concert venue was WAY understaffed - not enough bartenders (6) or organization for the crowd of people (6000) waiting to get a beer. A bartender was counting his tips while hundreds waited for drinks. 

3. Have hounds trying to sell you timeshares but they are sneaky and ask if you wouldn't mind touring a new section of the hotel for a bunch of free shit. Who doesn't want free shit? A bus ride, presentation and 4 hrs later FML

4. Cocktail waitress told me she was too busy to talk to me - I simply needed quick directions. 

5. While gambling our cocktail waitress was impatient and acted disgusted she even had to deal with us. Sorry I tipped you $5 for two Coronas. 

6. Internet kept kicking me off and was referred to a tech support like that's what I wanted to be doing on vacation

7. No mini fridge in over priced suite

8. Casino floor is like a labyrinth, confusing and cluttered


To be fair:

1. the rooms were nice (still over priced) and we had an awesome view. 

2. Our roulette dealer was nice, and there was one security employee who personally walked where we wanted to go.

3. Scantly clad women are dealers in one section which is pleasing to the eyes.

THE ROOMS:
We were lucky enough to get upgraded to a larger room with a pool view.  2 double beds, a couch, and a roll-away...perfect for six people (and we never felt crowded).  The room was clean, the beds were ridiculously comfortable, and the bathroom...wow, I still can't get over how big the bathroom was.  Icing on the cake: 2 huge mirrors in the room, 2 huge mirrors in the bathroom (one sink\/counter on each side) - perfect for a group of girls getting ready to go out =)

THE SERVICE:
Great - or any synonym of your liking, because frankly, I'm running out.  The casino dealers were friendly and patient - the guy at the craps table wasn't mad at me when i made the dice bounce onto the floor...whew.  Front desk and housekeeping were really helpful too...for some reason, I kept losing my toothbrush, and they didn't sound annoyed at all when I asked for one at 4 a.m.  Guess that's normal in Vegas...

SO MUCH TO DO!
We pretty much spent the entire weekend wandering around this hotel.  They have it all - various clubs and lounges, restaurants, huge shopping area, and of course...gambling.  Oh yeah, and there's a Fat Tuesdays and Pink's Hot Dogs...seriously, what more can you ask for?

PRIVE:
The most popular club at Planet Hollywood, that's for sure.  We got hooked up on the first night, so we were already pretty happy...then right when we get in, we're informed that Justin Timberlake is also partying at Prive.  WTH.

THE SPICE MARKET BUFFET:
Not exactly horrible, but...I definitely wouldn't recommend it.  Everything was basically salt-with-a-little-something-on-the-side.  I guess that's why it was only $21.99.  I would take off 1 star, but everything else about this place is so great that I don't really care about how bad the buffet was.  We were too hungover to eat anyway...",4,0,3

The windows are see through so don't be fooled , neighbors can see across and see your bed! So be sure to use the blinds as consideration.

Vegas is such a crowded strip that when casino's get built they are usually large, gaudy and everyone knows it's coming. Now granted I used to come to Vegas 10 times a year for years. I also took quite a bit of time from vacationing here and so by the time I got to stay here it's was established. Caesars has historically been known for shopping in Vegas, but the Miracle Mile of shops gives them a run for their money because of the variety and that all the shopping isn't just for women or fashionistas. I actually found some cool shops and not just a bunch of brand name designer shops predominantly patroned by women. 

Over the years my love for poker has died and I no longer play, except for ideal situations and Vegas isn't one of them. My love for craps has also waned, but my blackjack is in my blood and I still enjoy playing it, especially here. For me it's not the amount it's the vibe. Yea I usually stick to smaller amounts, but I don't mind the min amounts because I like the ambiance. The waitress' aren't any nicer, faster or better, but the feeling I get when playing here is something special and I make a point to play here when I'm in town. 

The rooms are a little too themed for me. They are large and comfortable the 2 top priorities, but aside from sleeping and getting ready I spend very little time here. It could be cleaner, but it was acceptable. Since it's right on the strip and in the middle of it the room views are excellent. The hotel itself isn't towering so most rooms are pretty easy to get to and I can make quick trips outside  easily. I find the room pricing to be a bit much with few specials. I get flyers and e-mails from many of the other larger casino's frequently, but not here. I no longer drive to Vegas and this being in the middle they will try and gouge you to get here, unlike some of the southern casinos. 

Gallery is a nice club to go to as a backup or if your able to go early to a better club and come here afterwards. It's the old Prive club revamped. I actually prefer coming here Thursdays versus weekends which can get packed, since the music is better than imo. Something I think all Vegas Clubs need to consider is the specialized music will draw more people than a new name or a new design. Will review separately as well.

As gimmicky as much of the hotel and decorations are if you stick to the table games areas you'll enjoy yourself. All slots areas are equally boring at all casino's, but leaving my room and going to the table games has an excellent view and vibe. 

Spice Market is the buffet. It's not the biggest, not the best, not the more varied, but what is does have is diversity. As the name suggests they do quite a bit of ethnic foods here like curry, cous cous, KBBQ, Kabobs on top of the usual's. Price is ok, cleanliness is good, service is excellent, but the variety reminds me a bit of a global food court. Crab legs pre split is a real plus, but they could be fresher. No lobster though. Will review separately as well.

It's not the biggest or the best or the nicest or the newest and I almost want to give them 4 stars.",2,1,0

Suddenly, there's a NON SMOKING Queen room available. I also asked nicely if we could get the Bellagio fountain view room. She said yes we would get the fountain view room. We went up to the 27th floor and we got the Sammy Davis Jr's room with full frontal view of Bellagio fountain, Caesars Palace, and The Cosmopolitan.

We were so happy with our room. The tub was nice and the separate shower was a nice touch. I love their bath products including the massage soap bar. The only downside is there's no refrigerator, so use the ice bucket for your bottled drinks.

I had requested a king non-smoking room and when I went to go check in after the 3pm checkin time, I was informed that all they had available was a king smoking room so I said okay. So I went up to my room and was pleasently surprised to find that the room didn't smell like smoke at all which was nice. i had a room on the 6th floor which gave me a view of the roof of the mall I believe. But hey I was not going to be in the room all that much so hey not everyone can have a great view in life. One thing that did suck was that if you don't use valet then you have to walk all the way through the mall with your luggage to get to the reservation\/ check in desk which is annoying. However it is on a great location on the strip. Easy to get everything you need. 

The room: The room was decent sized nothing super spectacular about the room. I had an indian jones themed room which was nice to have Harrison Ford looking over me as I slept. The bed was okay comfortable and clean. But the best thing about the entire room was the oversized bath tub. I don't have one at home so I took advantage of it almost everynight. 

The casino is a decent size, I didn't gamble much so. The mall is a nice attachment which provides you with shopping oppertunities and fast food options right at your fingertips. I ate at a restaurant downstairs called Yolo which was actually pretty good. 

I would definatly stay here again if I can find as good of a deal as I did this time.",1,0,0

Booked online and when booking it had a special request spot. We wrote ""first time in Vegas, would love a nice view."" (Sign up for ""total rewards"" when online booking, you get deals.)  
You can check-in on online... we did this before flight (super convenient). It was about 10 mins from airport, went to the kiosk when arrived got keys printed at kiosk... super fast and easy, zero issues, took about 10 mins. 
Stayed in the ultra resort vista room. We get to the room and were blown away, they defiantly delivered with the view :) THANK YOU SO MUCH!  Amazing view of the Bellagio fountains and strip. The room was a decent size, had character, totally updated, beautiful huge bathroom, big vanity, nice tub with window and another amazing view of the strip and also a flat screen and separate climate control in bathroom,  nice shower. It was all very clean. Bed was ok, not terrible but a little hard for my taste. 
Cool casino, night life and vibe. Different varieties of food choices and prices. Lots of shopping on resort at the miracle mile shops. 
It also has to have pretty good ventilation I might add because I don't smoke and have asthma and the smoke didn't bother me at all. 
The location was phenomenal! Close walking distance to almost everything. 
We ended up staying an extra night we like it so much. ---We booked at the counter this time, gave the total rewards # and asked if the pricing would be the same as online and were assured it was. But this ended up being untrue.... Called and spoke with them about it, they immediately corrected it. Very fast and apologetic about it, great customer service.  (***  BOOK ONLINE WITH TOTAL REWARDS!!**)
All and all so very happy with everything from beginning to end. Thank you so much Planet Hollywood for making our first tip to Vegas so awesomely memorable!!",3,1,1

Layed in bed resting for the next day of the carnival when i see what i thought was an insect. I called my friend that was staying in another room and he said it was a bed bug. We google an image of bed bugs and it was. I always thought bed bugs were small, but this bug was the size of pea. Called the front desk, they send someone up (security manager or something like that). They offered to change room, but I had to go to EDC. After the Electric Daisy Carnival, I went downstairs to ask what my options were. They didn't offer anything except to ask that I fill out a full report so that this issue could be 'thoroughly investigated'. I said to the lady that they already came up the prior evening and saw the bug. She said that there is nothing she can do but ask that I fill out a report so they can do a proper investigation. I grabbed my things and checked out. I don't think I need to say it, but I will never stay at this hotel again in my life. I understand that it is a hotel and they are more susceptible to bed bugs, but their service was just terrible when I brought this issue to their attention. I stayed in room 1972 if you care to know.

This place makes me feel like a pH resident, each stay offers a new experience but mostly everyone goes out of their way to ensure a happy over the top experience and customer. I got an email during the night letting me know I was able to check in, upon arriving I waited for about 2-3 hours for it to be ready. I was greeted promptly, played while I waited, and returned to see if it was ready. My casino host Dana G. had surprised me with a bigger king hip, there was a separate tub looking out the The Strip window and it had its own tv. I was delighted. Even surprised me with chocolate covered strawberries and champagne. Housekeeping does a great job. Cashier cage is efficient and friendly. Craps dealers are super nice I always make sure to say hi. Pit bosses are nice and remember you. Bartenders remember you most of the time and the TR counter is always doing a great job to be helpful. I don't see a reason to leave this place because there is everything you need, shopping, food, services, entertainment, no shortage of alcohol. My concerns are the attitude of a rude dealer, no oranges at the Extra bar, and the variety of slot machines could use an update.

The Hotel itself looks nice. It is located in the center of the strip. Very convenient and close to everything.

There's a mall inside, called Miracle Mile Shops. You can find there brands like Victoria's Secret, House of CB, Aldo, Steve Madden etc.

While walking around the mall you can see different shows on your way: Storm Illusion or Colorful Fountain Show, as well as the V Theater with amazing shows. This Hotel is also the home of or Britney Spears and JLo's shows. And also Backstreet Boys's pretty soon.

Cheapest room-decent, big, not too shabby

Expedia gives $25 buffet credit - pretty good buffet at that rate (lots of variety)

Middle of the strip

The NEGATIVES:
No minibar
No Keno area (for my grandpa)
Small gambling area (no more than 10-15 blackjack tables)
Still old Alladin mall

It really does have all the makings of a great hotel without paying that extreme markup (plus NO RESORT FEES). I would probably give this place 4 stars, but I'm biased because I was pretty lucky at the casino here.

Location: Center of the strip. Everywhere is within walking distance or you could always take a cab anywhere and not pay too much. I think some people think this aspect is overrated, but it was perfect for our group when we went to all the other hotels.

Rooms: Pretty nice rooms. We got a Mountain Resort room and the view wasn't that great though, so I would probably stick with something else. We just took it because we wanted more space and the his-and-her sinks were a plus.

Shopping: Normally I wouldn't list shopping here, but they do have the Miracle Mile shops attached to the casino and the ABC store is a very cheap place to buy alcohol or bottled water. Some of their drink prices were the same you would see in a grocery market back home like Safeway.

Casino: The Pleasure Pit is full of scantily clad women with low cut tops working the tables and attractive dancers who dance on top of the tables. Not much more you could ask for here. Music is also pretty good and keeps things going, even at 6am. The sports betting area feels a little laid back and almost reminds me of a theater seating.

Food: There's plenty of choices here from the Spice Market Buffet to Earl's. I would definitely hit up Earls, but the buffet is pretty good as well (large selection).

Club: Even though I had a VIP pass to go here, we didn't even bother trying. You probably don't want to waste your time here when you could just go across the street to Marquee or even down the strip to XS.

Overall: Great place to stay. We got a really good Cyber Monday deal and that price really sold it for me.",4,1,1

I did sooooo many review searches from travelocity, to google, yahoo, etc. You name it I searched it. It was between here or the PH Towers. So happy I chose this place. 

Luckily, I ended up with a pretty sweet view and I ordered a Hollywood Hip regular room on booking.com. I could see the fountains if I turned the chair by the window and heard them.

The bathrooms are HUGE and this is a standard room. Big Flat screen TV. Plush King sized bed, the room temperature, we couldnt really get right because during the day we would get cold, then hot, but at night we sweated our asses off because the sheets would be soaking wet in the morn (and it wasnt from any hanky panky) but the temp didnt cause any major dramatic probs for us, but it was something to point out.

The employees that I did interact with were friendly (front desk, gift shop, casino - trying to find our way around), etc, the casino itself is a casino like any other, nothing too fancy or anything, they had go go dancers and once you figure out if you're staying in the north or south tower, you're good to go.  Its a pretty hip hotel, we stayed in the Kingpin room with Woody Harrilson (sp) and there wasnt too much memorabilia like some other ppl had to deal with so that was a plus. The rooms are dark, but it was just me and my boyfriend staying there so we didnt mind because if we needed light we opened the shades, or turned on some light, big deal.

Housekeeping cleaned everyday, yet the room diagonally across from us ordered room service and they never took their cart away, I swear some of those carts were sitting there for 2-3 days, but luckily they werent RIGHT across from us or I wouldve been complaining, but we got a daily paper delivered every morning, and when we checked in we got the deal on the free bottle of liqour courtesy of staying there. And our rooms were close to the elevator.  

They could've had an iPod hook up or something for the rooms to cost what they do and for the hotel to be so 'hip' but again, another minor flaw in what was still an awesome trip to Vegas. 

I will say overall this is one of the hotels that caters to 20-young 30 somethings. And families....I guess.",0,0,0

casino area was great, not as smokey and foggy as other hotels. after hours, they have hot go go dancers dancing near casino tables, called the pleasure pit. Great for men! but table prices go up

they have a great shopping center, but can have more of a variety in resturant choices. 

rooms are great! nice view, nice decor, bedding and set up. 2 minor things. Bathroom toilet door has no lock, and the shower is see through, so sharing the bathroom while geting ready can be a little tough if you have a bunch of insecured friends. other than that that the bathroom was good enough, great tub to soak your feet after walking in heels all day!  for some reason due to the painting of the room, it was always dark! haha weird. 

the pleasure pool was not good! proabably one of the worst pools i've ever seen at a hotel... they have two small pools on the oppsite ends of eachother, while being seperated by a resturant and a large parking lot for bodies to tan. The lot in between was larger than the two pools combined! wth. the pool layout can be so much better, it was so hard to find a spot unless you were invited to Cabanas. music was good though. weird part, pool was on the 6th floor.... i do not understand why...

Since it's Planet Hollywood, there's movie memorabilia in the rooms. We had the Wayne's World room, which earned the place major brownie points in my book!

Nonetheless, I enjoyed my stay here as the bed I slept on was very comfortable, and the location in the middle of the Strip made most points of interest an easy walk. It also helped that the person at the front desk upgraded our room with a view of the Strip, and let us check in extremely early (I'm talking like 10:30 AM early, as compared to the suggested 3-4 PM check in). He let us know that it was possible our room was still being serviced, but we only waited a few minutes before it was all ready. This was very much appreciated! Thank you kind, front desk man!

The only problem I had with PH was finding the lobby. For some reason, that was much harder than it should have been, so for those reading this review who may be lost, take the escalators in the casino downstairs, and you'll magically find yourself in the lobby.

If I come back to Vegas and want glitz and glamour, I'll go elsewhere, but PH suits me just fine for now.",5,2,3

Pool is well designed for morning\/afternoon sunlight. It's not for swimming though as it is not deep at all, but the deck area is nicely done. 
Didn't particularly like the mall as it was just cavernous and not that many good stores (but I'm a guy and malls are aimed at women, so take that with a grain of salt). 

The one thing I would impart is the Buffet, which is NOT worth it. Went for Breakfast\/Brunch. 20 per person with tip and everything was very mediocre.

HOTEL: Check in was quick but they had run out of King non-smoking rooms, so we ended up with two Queen beds.  All the rooms are themed and we had The Munsters with Grandpa's cape, Eddie's outfit, and giant photos of the cast watching you as you bathe and sleep.  The room was comfortable and quiet, and the bathroom was huge.  Things have been redone since it was the Aladdin, but it definitely isn't on par with the nicer Vegas hotels as things were a bit scuffed and one of our towel hooks had been torn off the wall.  JB didn't have an iron in her room and was told they didn't have any.  She kept at it and they were able to bring one up pretty quickly.

SHOPS: The shops definitely still have the Aladdin feel although I'm not sure how they would make it feel more Hollywood.  Perhaps homeless folks in front of all the shops?  The shops were mostly what you would find at a nice mall back home, but they did have a huge Ben Sherman store (probably as big as the one on Carnaby Street in London).  Thumbs up for that.

CASINO: The casino floor is pretty small yet is very easy to get lost in.  The blackjack tables had $15 minimums, which went up to $25 on Saturday afternoon.  Our dealer complained that as a Harrah's hotel they wouldn't allow her to grandfather us into the $15 price yet she did so anyway.  Thanks!

SPORTS BOOK: The sports book has a ton of TVs and a huge scrolling ESPN type ticker, but only three low rows of fairly comfy leather chairs.  We had no problem finding seats for the Army-Navy game, but I expect it would be tough to find a spot on an NFL Sunday or during March Madness.  There was a new bet taker who was totally confused and tried to give me a parlay of Tennessee winning and losing at the same time.  Fortunately, I was able to set him straight.

THEATER: We came for the Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds show and the acoustics were great.  The place seats about 7,000 so it's not super intimate, but far better than going to a huge arena.",0,0,0

The room, though? HORRIBLE!

My room was had memorabilia from Val Kilmer's ""The Saint."" Wow.  Some bad blown up photographs, a Nokia Communicator, and a couple of pocket knives\/lock pick sets that Fat Val, himself, might have actually touched!  Not impressed.  It overlooked the rear of the casino\/away from the strip, so though I was on the 9th floor, I had a nice view of a rooftop.

When I got in the room, I opened the door to access the drawers. Kerchunk.  The hinges were loose and the door hung down at an angle.  Ah, well. I'll call that in.  I'd been traveling for 12 hours and had to use the bathroom.

No ventilation in the bathroom...so as I did my business, I did a courtesy flush.  Finished, used some toilet paper to wipe and reached for the toilet handle...ka-klink...ka-klink.  It offered no resistance.  So, now, I'm in a smelly bathroom and I didn't want to have to call maintenance, but after lifting the lid and determining the problem was the fill valve\/water supply (and making sure it was on), I had no choice.  They responded quickly, but were unable to effect more than a temporary half-fix. For the rest of my stay, I just had to plan my flushes, as it took very long to refill.

Okay...off to get a workout. Where's the gym?  Check the hotel guide...no mention of it.  However, if you read their comprehensive spa book, you'll MAYBE find reference to it and the per use fee.  Seriously?  Okay...I'm in a hotel and I don't like taking elevators, anyway.  Time to find the stairs.

Trash...beer bottle...condom wrapper...used condom...got down to the third floor and the stair well turned into a corridor.  Down the corridor to find more liquor bottles and an alarmed door at the end...and human feces where somebody squatted and crapped on the wall near the floor.  Nice little pile there.

Outta here. Back up a couple of flights to catch the elevator. Got outside for some exercise. Came back. Shower stall...gross. Is that just mismatched grout or is it dirty? Some of both. There was a large crack in the tile and water had seeped through it, loosening the wallpaper near the door.  Looked TERRIBLE. Come on, guys...at least caulk the crack, reattach the paper, and throw a new bead of white caulk on the outside!

The result is a 21st century casino and mall with a 1970's hotel. The casino and mall are in surprisingly great shape considering they have been used heavily for a decade.  The rooms not so much.  My room had ugly old carpet and wallpaper.  No bar or refrigerator.  The shower door metal frame had rust on it.  There were 2 sinks and one ran hotter than the other.  The door to the toilet was warped and split. The toilet flushed weakly. The lights were dim and I had to turn all of them on to get decent lighting.  The furniture was obviously newer.  The room was themed after a tv show and had a few cool momentos from the show.  I wanted to take a picture of one of the momentos but the lighting was awful.  The tv was basic cable with the option to buy movies or porn.   The elevators were dirty and beaten up.  Obviously old and barely weezing along.  One time, the elevator stopped and the doors shuddered but didn't open.  I pulled a bit on the door and it opened.  The service by the cleaning staff and desk was fine.  Unremarkable.  No raves but no complaints.  

The pool area was a big disappointment.  A ton of unshaded concrete, 2 small pools and something called a ""flowrider"".  Hardly anybody was in the pools. Not exactly the place to be. Around the pools were a bunch of ""cabanas"" that offered shade and a soft surface for 35 bucks.  35 bucks does not include food or drinks.   I'm not paying $35 to read a book, dip in the pool and drink a complimentary bottle of water and still pay for $16 drinks. Not on top of the room reservations and ""resort fees"".  That's crazy.  For people staying there, the least they could do for $35 is throw a few drinks in or some food or just charge less, a lot less.  It would also be cool if they catered to the non-party crowd.  Individuals and pairs who just want to chill by the pool like people....on vacation.  A poolside beach chair w an umbrella for a hundred dollar a night room isn't an unreasonable expectation.

The casino is large, loud and very confusing to navigate.  They should have installed fans in the ceiIing to filter out some of the cigarette smoke and a few centralized floor plans would be nice.   I gambled a bit here and there at several of the tables over the 3.5 days I was there.  Was dealt by several different dealers.  The quality of dealing varied wildly but was mostly good or above average.  Such is Vegas.  A couple dealers were bored and inattentive and made mistakes with players' money.  Some didn't know the payouts.  Some were engaged and chatty and kept the atmosphere positive.  Some were very relaxed and professional and let the players play.  Prompt and efficient and pleasant and helpful.  A couple others were strict and controlling, like its ""their"" table and they set the rules. Only one dealer was unprofessional to the point of driving players away.  She constantly snapped at the players to obey this or that rule and was sarcastic.  When one guy who was obviously new to gambling and nervous put his cards in his lap, she flipped out and yelled at him and deliberately humiliated him in front of the table and her supervisor. He finished his hand and scurried off.  I finished w my stack and bailed and avoided that table for the rest of the night. The music was great and the dancers beautiful.  Many of the dealers were also very good looking.  My overall gambling experience was good.   

Sum total: the hotel is a sad old mess, the pools might as well not be there, the casino is great, the mall is a mall, the dealers above average and the food options, thanks to the mall and the casino restaurants were plentiful,  Worth a visit to gamble and drink but there are better places to stay.",0,0,0

we had to buy a rollaway bed because their were 5 of us, and we only wanted it for one night since we knew we weren't going to sleep the other night.  but when we went to the front desk to tell them that the bed wasn't picked up and that we didn't want to be charged for two nights, they told us that we wouldn't be charged for either nights.  yay!  

the bathroom was bigger than i expected (two sinks across from each other with plent of counter space, a shower, a bathtub and an individual little room for the toilet)  and the cleaning people were really nice because they knew there were alot of us so they hooked us up with more towels and shampoo bottles than needed.  the beds were comfy (although the bedspread was kinda ugly) and the wall hangings consisted of scenes from different movies and other memorabilia.  (we had a scene with owen wilson and vince vaughn in the wedding crashers, and some gun in a shadow box from some other movie, and that one dude from the gladiator was in our bathroom hanging over our bathtub.  kinda random, but whatever.  we didn't get the chance to try the pool, so i have no idea how the pool was.  it was pretty hot in vegas, so i'm guessing it would've been crowded.

i can't really complain about planet hollywood, due to the fact that i had an AWESOME time in vegas and most of the time was spent outside the hotel, but it did its job of being a place to crash after a long night.",0,0,0

Each room is themed to a specific movie and features props and memorabilia. We had an awesome time at the pool, which was yet again young, hip, and filled with good looking people.

POSITIVES
- Great cleaning crews. Very quick to get extra blankets upon requests.
- Location is awesome on the strip, very close to the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio.

NEGATIVES
- Out of the 6 elevators that were there for each section of the building, it seemed like only 2 were operating. In my 3 days there, I had to run up or down to the 12th floor 4 times. That's unacceptable.
- The valet took upwards of 30 minutes to get the vehicle ready.
- The bathroom doesn't have any locks. So if you stay there with other people, it's free game for who can go in. The toilet itself is separated but the shower is in the same room as the washroom so it makes it difficult to do both simultaneously if you want privacy.",1,0,0

The bad:  Koi night club in the hotel is tacky and promoters everywhere trying to 'walk you in' for $20 each (including girls).  Fitness center allows only two persons per room and requires ID to enter the damn thing.

1) It's a Starwood Hotel - meaning I can use points to redeem a free room
2) It's much more prettier than the Aladdin - it's pretty swanky
3) The rooms are decked out with tv\/movie pictures and memorabilia - ours was Days of our Lives (which was perfect since my best friend - the bachelorette loves that show)
4) The room is clean, the beds are comfortable and the bathroom can fit 4 girls trying to get ready to hit hte club
5) There is no limit on room service - meaning you can order it all day long. Our laziness got us room service not just once but three times in one day (and that means 3 different room service tables)
6) The staff is nice if you have questions - the concierge helped us to try to find $10 steak & lobster
7) You feel like a celebrity walking through here
8) It has the Miracle Mile shops - if you like your shopping
9) Free bottles of water in the room - thank you PH, no hangover or dehydration
10) Reasonable priced rooms! Booyah!!

Checking in was easy and although I booked a room with a strip view I was offered a room that had a view of the fountains at the Bellagio for $30 a night.  Now that I think about it I should have just saved that money and stayed in whatever room I booked because the actual window was fairly small and you could basically see the fountains and part of Paris.  Not really worth the $30 upgrade charge.

The room was nice and somewhat clean.  One of the bedside tables was dusty throughout our stay and I believe we got clean sheets twice.  For what I paid I suppose I shouldn't be expecting more.  

My complaints....when we tried ordering room service no one picked up the line.  I had to call twice to get someone to answer.  Then a day before check out I went to the hotel lobby to request a late checkout because our flight was a little bit later in the afternoon.  The person working the front desk said I would have to call back in the morning to request it.  When asked how early is early because I could call at 4am if I had to I was told ""just call early"".  So I call that night at midnight and they only gave me an hour extra...not a lot but two hours would have been perfect.

Overall it was a good stay but I feel that for the extra money spent upgrading I should have stayed across the street at one of the City Center hotels.  Live and learn I guess.",0,0,0

Another obstacle was the casino.  It was like a maze. Eventually, I learned by the second day.  Anywhere you want to go can be seen at the center of the casino where the Heart Bar is.  No matter where you are, beeline for the Heart Bar, and then find your destination from there.

The hotel and casino is very modern and chic.  We rented out one of their larger suites.  The theme of the suite was Indiana Jones, so it had many props from the movie.  This suite had two large bedrooms, a 180 degree view of the strip, a bar, a large living area with a large plasma tv, surround sound, mp3 player, sofas, a dining area, and a tub in the middle of the living area.  Each of the bedroom has its own plasma tv and bathrooms with soaking tubs.  For renting out the suite for the entire weekend, the hotel gave us two large bottles of liquor - Crown Royal (my fave) and Vodka.  So that suite alone was party central.  The suite is majorly pimped out.  At the casino, they have a place called the Pleasure Pit.  While you're gambling, there are dancers (not strippers) on platforms.  This hotel caters to people younger adults like myself.  That's pretty awesome. They also HAD a club upstairs called Prive.  Not sure what's going on with that now.  I think they were slapped with a liquor fine.  They also have many retail stores there in case you need to do some shopping.  I'm giving this place 3 stars because I forgot my cell phone in the suite and only realized it when I was on the road back home.  I called their lost and found and never received a call back.  At least call me and tell me that they didn't find it.  I'm sure the maids took it and went through my pictures and videos and enjoyed all the nakedness in there.  It was purely my fault and I know it slipped out of my pocket.  That or I left it in one of their gift shop counters as I was paying for my merchandise.  Sucks!

The best thing about this hotel is the price considering the location. The actual hotel was a bit mediocre. 

The ambiance in the casino is contemporary and cool. It's pretty dark and noisy, making it feel pretty clubbish. The casino floor is small and a bit cramped, making it a little hard to navigate and enhancing that nightclub feel. 

There are six elevators for each tower. We stayed in the South tower and the elevators moved very VERY fast, as in ""hold your drink and run if you want to make it in the door"" fast. I would not recommend this hotel for people who have children or wheelchairs in tow. It just doesn't feel safe. For example: we were going down and the doors opened to two gentlemen waiting to get on. The first guy boarded and the doors snapped shut. I mashed the ""doors open"" button, but the square box of doom just started looming down. Seriously, the doors stay open for about 3-5 seconds. 

We got to our room which was evidently the ""Beetlejuice Room"". There were pictures of grossed out Michael Keaton hung up in the bedroom and over our soaker tub (pretty sure that's the last thing I want to see while I'm getting undressed. There was a weird table that didn't fit in the room showcasing a book prop that was used in the movie. It was lit up and we couldn't find the off switch so we just had to unplug it. And the piece de resistance was the glove prop from the movie that was mounted on the wall. You know the scene when the scary ass shrimp cocktail hands reach up and grab everyone's faces? Yes. That effing glove was hanging over the bed. I swear this hotel room is where nightmares are born. 

It felt like the room was designed by someone who has never stayed in a hotel before. There were large columns that looked like closets but didn't open. I don't know what their purpose was aside from taking up square footage. The weird book display table forced the armchair to sit at the foot of one of the beds, so we had to climb over the chair and around the lamp to open and close the shade. The shade, by the way, is a roman shade so light does flood in through the sides. If you are one of those weirdos like me who likes it dark when you sleep, you might want to bring a sleep mask. 

The A\/C didn't seem to work very well. We had it set at 68 and still found it warm. 

The room lighting was really lame. There was a task lamp on the desk, a table lamp on the blow table (the too-large round table between the beds, complete with mirrored top), the weak floor lamp that required vaulting over the chair to reach, and the entry light that had maybe a 20 watt bulb in it. We spent a lot of time in the bathroom so that we could see anything. The good thing was that the bathroom was pretty spacious so we both could get ready at the double vanity, despite the tub taking over some of the vanity space.

I should give props to the sound. The room was pretty darn quiet. 

Service was lackluster. Staff avoided eye contact as much as possible, except for the housekeepers, they were nice. Not sure why the would give us fresh towels and leave the used ones, though. Maybe I missed a memo.

The rooms are still the same size and quality. I got upgraded to the larger room, deluxe I think, which is always nice (always ask). They changed the shampoo\/soap\/etc with the new theme and that's a GREAT thing. No more funky, spicy shampoo.

Feels like the staff is better too. Hopefully being more formally part of the Starwood family will have a positive impact on service, even if the personnel stays the same. Their service was average at best before the conversion. 

The new 24 hour restaurant called the Dailies looks much better but the breakfast was horrible. They found a way to screw up eggs scrabled with some veggies. The sausage tasted like it was straight from the microwave. Service was pretty darn slow too. Pass on breakfast here.

I like other hotels in Las Vegas much better, but the price is right and you get Starwood points.",0,0,0

I've booked fairly last minute (a day ahead) to spend a weekend with friends in Vegas and PH was the only available hotel close to my friends with a reasonable price (~$100). When I checked in, I ended up with a room on the 22nd floor that looked okay at first glance. Just super dark. Minutes later I knew why: half the lights weren't working anymore. The dresser door was partly unhinged and was missing some of its doors altogether. 

Unable to reach the front desk after spending 15 minutes on the phone, I gave up, telling myself it's just for sleeping and showers, it'll do. 
When I've started filling the bathtub, you could tell it wasn't cleaned in a while. Dust and all kinds of things started floating as the water rushed in. Before it was too dark to see it. 

Worst of all was the so called resort fee. Wifi was really bad and the pools were closed for winter. Yet they keep charging $32 per night even though.

The room was a decent size. Bed was comfy. The purple bath towels...that was interesting. :) I guess it worked with their old theme of Aladdin (former hotel name). My little one was a fan of the round bathtub with a nice view of the city. Bath products were decent, toilet paper was soft (hey that's important too!). Two flat screen panels, one for the sitting area and one for the bedroom. 

And...here's one for the boys: the ""Pleasure Zone."" 
When you gamble at night (we were there on weekend), there's an area call ""pleasure zone."" Basically, they have hot dealers practically in bathing suites with nice curves trying to distract you from focusing (and hence more money for them). They also have poles and dancers (obviously dressed for the occasion) dancing in the area. Very smart strategy, isn't it? So, you weigh what's more fun, gambling with pole dancers, or going to a strip club and paying $500-$1000 but being about to touch them. Personally, I don't get distracted so it has no impact on me. I feel sorry for the boys who lose as a result of losing their concentration, but I suppose to some it's worth it. Suckers... :) 

Oh, and their promotion of getting a free bottle of alcohol per visit was nice. They have a quite a few choices--tequila, vodka, bailey, champagne...if you want to go for the most expensive it's Sky Vodka (i'm not a fan). You also get $25 matching table play, which contributed to my winning. All included as part of a $69 room! 

Only negative is parking---unless you valet (which I find hard to trust w\/ my car)...you walk a mile from the parking lot to get to your room! Good exercise I suppose.",0,0,0

On the last night of the trip, we came back to find that the deadbolt of the door was out, cracking the door open slightly. This took us by surprise as we know the door closed behind us when leaving that evening (it would take a concentrated effort to turn the deadbolt open before leaving the room which we know neither of us did). We found that strange and then as we entered the room, we checked the safe and found that $600 of cash was stolen. We then realized that my entire backpack was taken (which had a work laptop in it along with a tablet ($2500 value in total) along with my husband's watch that was left on the bathroom counter ($150 value). We contacted security immediately and after 10 minutes of waiting and no one showing up, we called again. 10 minutes later - still no one showed up. Called again and expressed our urgency and finally 5 minutes after that, someone showed up. They had us fill out a report and told us they can check on if anyone entered the room right away. They checked that night and the two security officers argued in front of us whether or not they could tell us the results of that report. They end up telling us the results which was that no one had been in there and we must have left the door open behind us and that they will send the report to Risk Management and we can call back in 5 days to get the results of the report. I call back within 5 days - no answer so I leave a message. A few days after that I get a call from a 3rd party who was investigating the matter telling me that they are still looking into it. In the meantime, I called Planet Hollywood's Risk Management Office several times (4 to be exact) - still no one answers and I leave a message every time but no one ever calls me back. Call the third party to get a status on my report and he tells me that they found Planet Hollywood did not demonstrate gross negligence so there is nothing they can do. What truly disappoints me throughout this whole experience is that Planet Hollywood never once spoke to me about this matter or offered up any type of apology or comp (they could have at least comped one night stay or provided a free meal or something to show that they cared and were sorry about the incident - minimal cost to them that would go a long way in making this experience feel less terrible to the customer). A few things that make me terribly unsettled with this incident: 1.) I have read very similar events happening on other reviews which feels like this may be a trend at this hotel and Planet Hollywood seems to be doing nothing about it. Cameras are only in the elevator banks on floors and due to the number of stories I am hearing from others with this same issue, I cannot believe they do not increase security (perhaps its because this is an inside job??) 2.) Neither Planet Hollywood nor this ""third party"" (which by the way, is just a firm who works for Planet Hollywood so if they are hired by Planet Hollywood how are they independent and looking out for my interests at all? Answer is they are not. They are there to help out Planet Hollywood) ever explained to me how someone was able to enter my room. They say no one had entered with a key based on their testing (which they could not show me a copy of the report so how am I to believe that?) but they also say the door was functioning properly and closing behind us properly. We 100% know we did not turn that deadbolt prior to leaving. This baffles me. 3.) Planet Hollywood was not very supportive of us calling the Las Vegas police about it. We did end up doing that and the police had us come into the station to file a report as they do not come to the scene for these issues. Speaking the police, it sounds like this is not uncommon for Planet Hollywood.

Overall - awful experience here. Even if I remove this entire incident I still would not recommend staying here. Rooms are average at best, the casinos and bars are nothing to write home about and the customer service is clearly sub-par.

Felt the need to write this review so that you don't go through the same thing. If I read this review prior to staying there, I would absolutely not stay at Planet Hollywood. Its one thing if its an isolated incident but I have read on the internet this EXACT same fact pattern by 3 or 4 other hotel guests. Don't stay here if you want to feel like you personal items are secure. If you do stay here, assume you will be robbed and don't bring anything of value with you.",0,0,0

Planet Hollywood is one of the better locations to stay due to it proximity on the strip alone! 

I've received countless offers throughout the new year giving me no reason that I should not visit Vegas, besides that I'd gamble hard working money away.

Great deal on the room (if you want to know prices PM me) and we got upgraded for free to a strip view room! GREAT view, which included full view of the new city center and a partial view of the Bellagio fountain show (boyfriends personal fave). We also checked in early.

When we got upgraded, the lady asked us if it would be a problem if the room was near the elevator. No, no that would not be a problem at all. If anything, yes please! Perks to being near the elevator, only one neighboring room and well...close to the elevator! We were room 3617 just in case you're wondering. Also the 'Dragnet' room. I have no idea what show\/movie that was, but you'll have Dan Akroyd and Tom Hanks watch over you as you sleep and bathe. 

The first thing I do when I check into a hotel room...look at the vanity set up. Often hotels will have attached mirrors to the wall or have bad lighting situations, BUT they had a huge makeup mirror that wasn't glued down! I moved it on over near the window to get some natural lighting, +++!!

On top of that, the window had a nice little seating area where you could chill!

Closet space was good (his and hers), television was big, bed was comfy, but we had to ask for more pillows since they were lacking in fluff.

Bathtub was nice and BIG, another +, but the shower was kind of small. The toilet was separated from the rest of the bathroom by a door. The bathroom also had double doors for the entrance...kind of weird....I could do without that. No locks for the double door.

We did run into some troubles with the plumbing. The sinks stopper was stuck, so they sent someone over with a quickness to repair that for us. When I would drain the tub, the sink bubbled up. Kinda gross. (-)

The pool is small, but nice. There's also a hot tub! The layout is kind of wack...the pool is located on the 6th floor. You have to get to the pool early if you want good sunbathing seats actually NEXT to the pool...I know, kind of weird huh? They also have misting seats and cabanas up for renting...but they're ghetto. Haha

Anyways, I would recommend staying here! If anything, for the mere location and the fact that Planet Hollywood houses Earl's Sandwiches and has 5 dollar roulette tables on the weeknights. Also a Sephora (in case you forget any makeup) and an Urban Outiftters (in case you want to pick up a big floppy hat for sun bathing).

Make sure to stop by the customer service booth in the mall to get the coupon book! Oh and they put magazines in the room for you to read! I sure love me some celebrity gossip!


--On a sidenote, on the Mezzanine level they were having an auction for a lot of Michael Jackson's belongings (and others such as Anna Nicole Smith and Cher), they allowed us to look and photograph things. They said not to touch, but I touched. I touched Michael Jackson's couch! Ahhh!!",3,2,1

So bad that it should be getting a negative 5 review. My friend and I stayed here from 7\/14 and checked out on 7\/16. On Saturday morning 7\/15 my friend and I got back to our room around 4am. We closed our door put our ID, debit card, and room key on the table. We also put our phones charging next to us on the night stand. I get a call from my friend who was staying down the hall on our room phone around 9am. My friend said that she tried calling both our phone and they were dead.

We were literally shaking at the idea that someone had come in to our room while we were SLEEPING and took our things that were right next to us on the night stand. We called hotel security and they came upstairs to write a report. They seemed so nonchalant about the whole situation and was at first trying to make it seem like we were drunk and misplaced it when we came in. We had to repeat our story a million times. Then they finally say we can write a report with their security but since it was a ""non emergency situation"" we would have to file separately with the police and drive ourselves down there. I was so freaked out knowing that someone had come into the room and the security guy was seriously training a new guy on their procedures -_-. The security guy said after filling out the report that we weren't the only ones who are filling out reports and that others are going through what we are! I was livid. I kept asking what about your cameras and these guys say they don't have any in the hallways. The only cameras were near the elevators. Seriously ? If someone is going to steal our shit they wouldn't take the elevators if they know there are cameras there! So anyways we had our rooms switched and some guy comes to deliver the room key.

I asked him what room number is this and he gives me a room number and says he's ""99% sure that's what it is."" I asked him to verify it please so we don't get stuck in the halls for getting wrong information of our room number. He grabs a piece of paper that was in the trash and looks at it and goes ""oh it's so and so room number."" I looked at him like are you kidding me you almost sent us up to the wrong room. I called the front desk asked if we will get comp'd for anything and they said they can't do anything and that it's up to the security company to see if we get anything back. I have never been so annoyed in my life. On top of it we waited around for the security guys to come back and give us an update since they said they would be back in an hour and they never came back.

But our room was very clean AND we got a free bottle of liquor when we checked in.  They gave us a little ticket to take to the gift shop for it, we were expecting a small little bottle but it was actually a full sized bottle.  YAY!  We tried their breakfast buffet the day we checked out and it was GREAT too.  They had given us a $5 off coupon as well when we checked in, so for the two of us it was like $20.",0,0,0

They also have the Spice Market Buffet, only the best buffet in Las Vegas!  

I played a bit of craps here, and I really enjoyed myself.  The table was hot, and the dealers still took the time to help me out.  One dealer in particular, James, kept me smiling the whoe time.  I was teaching my friends how to play, and James kept chiming in and filling in the gaps when I didn't know why I was betting a particular way.

There was an error with the name in reservation showing under my sisters name. We always travel together and we each have an Expedia account. Many times I. Ok our family trips for us . I didn't catch I booked under Expedia account not mine but DID use my credit card. The desk manager TJ couldn't have been less empathetic or customer service or solution oriented. Although he insisted he had to follow rules and policy of the hotel it was the lack of empathy and condescending attitude which was really disappointing. Hotels always go above and beyond to correct issues. Unfortunately Planet Hollywood and its management team seem not to understand this. I was turned away with my luggage. Expedia representative was shocked as she advised he could have picked phone up to call them and simply make the name change as it was under my credit card. I will never visit this hotel again due to experiencing poor customer service. I will also tell all of my family members and friends about my experience. Imagine... you visit Vegas and are ready to check in but it never happens! What a let down.,1,0,0

If you're walking the strip, Planet Hollywood is centered pretty well in the middle, so you can walk either way, without tiring yourself out too much. While checking in, we tried the $20 room upgrade trick, which didn't work, so we were stuck with our room without-a-view. Which was really okay because we weren't in Vegas to sit in the room anyway!
I believe we had the least expensive option and our room was a pretty typical hotel room...average sized and clean. The bathroom on the other hand, was quite large and included a separate shower, bathtub, toilet with a door, and a roomy counter with sink and large mirror. When everything is separate, it really makes it nice for getting ready to go out (multiple people can get ready at once). 
The casino part of the hotel was also nice and features the Pleasure Pit, which basically consists of sexy, scantily clad dealers and go go dancers, dancing to popular music.
The attached Miracle Mile Shops have practically everything you could want with many higher end shops, some great restaurants and bars, and tons of entertainment options. We saw several shows while visiting, including Marc Savard, Comedy Hypnosis, located in the V theater in the Miracle Mile Shops and Holly Madison in Peepshow, located in the CHI Showroom in the hotel. If you're interested in seeing Holly, Planet Hollywood is definitely a good place to stay. We were walking through the casino on our way to our room one night, and happened to see Holly and a cameraman. They were apparently filming for the show Extra, so we stood in the background. Didn't get to see the show when it aired, but it was great way to meet Holly! And if you are looking to see her, act fast because I believe her stint at Peepshow will be ending this year.
Overall, I would absolutely stay here again and definitely recommend this hotel to others. It is a nice, mid-range hotel in an excellent location and has many things to do and see in a close general proximity.",1,0,1

They seemed tired, dated and, in some places worn.  But the basics were there.  A comfortable bed, hot water in the shower and an HVAC that worked as required.

What I really liked about Planet Hollywood was the set up of the Hotel and the Casino.  Unlike other hotels where you have to walk for what seems like miles, everything was easy to locate, right near the elevators and overall very pleasant. 

We also had a really fun time people watching at the Heart bar in the casino that was centrally located and had a bartender that really knew how to craft great cocktails. 

So, based on the setup I will give the extra star and call it a four.

We were able to see maybe 3 of the Bellagio's fountain that went off every 30 minutes. Kids really wanted to swim but the pools were closed for the season.

No long wait to check in, no issue with customer service, there was a upgrade available for $50, no free room upgrade for us. Our room was the star wars theme. Huge bathroom. Sink clogged a little but we only really used it in the morning. No fridge in the room, but you can have them send one up for a fee.

The casino was a whole lot livelier than Aria or Cosmopolitan. They did have go go dancers dancing at the pleasure pit (middle of casino). The heart bar was also in the middle of the casino and played music all night long. There was a flash mob every night in the casino, forget what time they did it, but the crowd loved it.

Another great thing about this casino is the location, if you step outside to the left you can take the kids to New York New York or Excalibur arcade, the MnM or Hershey's factory is on the way. Plenty of food spots. If you walk out to the right you can head to Caesars Palace which is not to far of a walk.

If you decided you don't want to go out, the mall is perfect in PH, you can go shopping, you can eat, there is a buffet at Todai. I suggest you try Earls sandwich, super good. We got a $30 burger from Gordon Ramsey's spot ""BURGR"", trust me its well worth the $30. I didn't want to get it but believe the hype.

We took full advantage of the 2 Starbucks on property. There is an ABC store in the mall right outside of the casino. There is also a Walgreens attached to the hotel outside to the left and a CVS across the street. If the kids are looking for the usual McDonalds there is one outside to the left of the casino. 

The reason for 3 stars is because there was a chip on one of the drinking glasses in the room and one day our room was not clean for some reason. Also there was never any ice on our floor, we had to get it from Starbucks or the floor above or below. They did remove the $25 daily resort fee for the issues.

The casino floor is beautiful and very lively!
We had a couple of meals at Earl of Sandwich.
We also had dinner at Gordon Ramsy's Burgr.
We saw Brittney Spears at the theater at Planet Hollywood.

As you can see, there is a ton to do here for the younger crowd and I would recommend staying here if you are looking for some lively action.

In terms of location on the strip - Planet Hollywood is in a great location! You are right by the Bellagio and only a few minute walk to Cesar's palace.  The other nice part is that the casino floor is very close to the strip, unlike at Bellagio and Cesars where it seems like its a mile walk up the door!

Room Type: Hollywood Hip Fountain View
Room Number: 3683

Check in:
Considering it was Friday 1pm the line was short. I had to pay a $16 fee for checking in before 3pm. However they do offer to simply hold your luggage until 3pm so you can venture off and check in later to avoid the fee.

Service:
Everyone working there seemed very helpful and tentative. I did not make any special request apart from the view. I asked the lady at Check in if they had any rooms available on the 30th floor with 2 beds and she gave us one on the 36th. I felt that was a good level of service as she was very tenacious when searching for it on their system
Room service came every morning without fail and even returned later when requested.

Casino\/Restaurants\/Local Venues
The hotel as you may know is attached to the Miracle Mile Mall which has an array of stores and restaurants that you would find in many Malls.
In side the lobby there is a Starbucks and on the Casino level you will find another one which I heard is open 24hrs. Also there are many restaurants such as Pinks HotDogs (yes the one from California) Gordon Ramsey's Burger, Planet Dailies and various other cuisines. 
The old Gallery Night Club has gone and is now KOI which has more of a lounge bar feel to it. - This isn't a very popular venue and does not attract any popular DJ's however its worth seeing as promoters around the Casino will give you free entry and a free drink to just step inside.

The Room:
The rooms are themed by movies - We had The Long Kiss Goodnight. As you see in the photos they decorate the room with costumes and props from the movie.
I feel the photos on the website did not fully reflect the room. They very rarely do. 
It comes equip with the basics - Large TV, Shower and Bath tub and it was very clean and tidy yet the furniture is slightly worn and scratched.
The view was impressive of the fountains, however, the wind was very small. I would expect a room advertised as (and priced as) a Fountain View Room to have floor to ceiling windows as at TheHotel (soon to be Delano) and The Encore. 
For the price I cannot complain. Although the quality does not compare to that of The Signature it certainly is better value than that of the newly refurbished MGM Grand.

The Location of Planet Hollywood is almost dead center of The Strip (It seems Bellagio is the most central to North and South) which is a bonus and its dead opposite The Cosmopolitan so if you wanted to visit the popular Marquee Nightclub you would not need a taxi at all.",2,1,1

And now the hilarious. As soon as we walked in we noticed a bright lipstick outline in bright red on the bright white duvet cover. Then what looked like a ""booger"" on the duvet as well. Then what looked like a sh*t stain on one of the pillows. Then we noticed the carpet was un-vacuumed with a woman's hair ""scrunchy"" on the carpet. And finally the toilet was broken. Well the maintenance guy fixed that quickly followed by the a housekeeper who took care of the rest.
As we were there for a convention and we had to take down our displays in the mid-afternoon we ""tried"" to request a later check-out (check-out is 11am).

I'm a local but figured my GF and I would spend a few nights on the strip and go out to dinner or shows. I went to the diamond check in area around 6 PM, tipped the women checking me in and then had a nice chat with her. As I diamond member on my birthday and during midweek I was totally expecting at minimum an upgrade to their junior suite and hoping if I got lucky\/they were nice I might get something better. After a few minutes the women said she was able to get me an upgrade. I took the keys and went up stairs, when I got to the room and entered it it was totally dirty and not cleaned. When i looked around some more it was full of someone stuff including their keys. I soon realized that they had someone given me keys to a room occupied by another guest. In all my travel around the world I have never had this happen, not in third world countries so not sure how it happens in Vegas, I was astonished and really concerned. 

I thought about going down and complaining to the manager, giving away an occupied room is a major safety concern both for the person whose room it is and for the other guest given the keys. I figured the women who checked me in was nice and I did not want to get her or someone else in trouble so I just went back to the diamond check in area. I figured they would be super concerned by it and extremely apologetic. Instead they just did not care, they mentioned that this had already happened once today. They then said they did not have any more rooms in the category that they had given me. I asked that I then be upgraded and they told me there were no upgraded room available at all and they were sold out. I questioned this as i knew it was untrue but they assured me that it was the case and they have conventions and all suites were sold out. Upon return to my room I look up availability online and many suites were available including the one I had specifically ask for and been lied to that it was not available. They then unapologetically downgraded me to my original room and basically could have cared less about compromising my safety and the safety of the person whos room they have previously given me the keys to.

I was with my girlfriend so I just went up to my room and let it drop. The following day I was thinking about it more and it really bothered me both from a customer service perspective but even more so from a safety standpoint and the fact that it seemed totally normal to them to give out keys to rooms occupied by others. I went down to the front desk and requested to speak to a manager around 3 PM, they informed me that he was in a meeting but they had my cell phone and he would call me as soon as he was out. Of course that did not happen and around 5:30 I went back to the front desk to try and speak to him again.

I explained the situation to him and he seemed to apologize and said that was not how things should have been handled and that he would look into it and get back to me. He said he was on duty till 11PM that night and not to worry he would deal with it. I very much expected a call back to explain the situation at the minimum but of course I received nothing.

On a separate note the rooms are decorated in the cheapest way possible, everything looks like its from ikea. They only have 1 thing of tissues in the bathroom and none in the room. There is no coffee maker in the room, basically never seen this anywhere in the world. The bath towels are so rough and used that I would have thrown them out year ago at home, worst towels I have used in a hotel in a while. No water in provided in the room, even for diamond guests. No turndown service. The elevators going up to the rooms are the dirtiest I have seen in vegas outside of downtown.

This is simply unacceptable from a customer service standpoint but more importantly I no longer feel safe staying at any caesars properties as I now know that they regularly hand out keys to occupied rooms and don't think its a big deal. This both puts my physical safety at risk and give me great concerns that valuable items I have in the room or sensitive business documents are not safe.",6,3,0

We got a great room with the Robin Williams ""Toys"" theme. The theme was the only negative thing about the hotel. It was creepy having him and these toys watch me in the bathroom. Otherwise the furnishings were awesome and the view was amazing. We were there over New Years and faced the City Center. We got to watch the fireworks from our room and it kicked butt! After the fireworks, we walked outside and partied with a ton of fun people. 

There is a great selection of shopping and dining experiences thanks to the Miracle Mile. There is a little mexican restaurant that had super cheap, filling and delicious breakfasts, along with cheap bloodies. There was a cool, round bar in the center of the mall.

The casino was fun. The dealers were awesome. Tons of free drinks, even at slot machines. Cocktail waitresses were great. Guys, be sure to hit up the Passion Pit. Gambling with a side of hot, half-naked chicks.

We arrived late night during Halloween weekend, and upon check-in said they had a room for us with one king bed and it was smoking.  Considering we had four people and smoking room was not even an option, they were very fast in re-accomindaitng us to a suite on the top floor which they said was normally reserved for high rollers.  I figure they use these rooms as for comped stays and over bookings since you can't even find the room we stayed in on the hotel website.  It was on the second to highest floor and needed a key for elevator to take you to it.   The suite featured high ceilings, a bar, 1 bedroom with a pullout and a living room.  The bathroom also featured a tub, shower and TV.  I would guess the suite was about 1,000 sf.  

What is also great is the location.  It's right in the middle of the strip.  Across from city center\/Bellagio and in between MGM & Ballys\/Harrah's.  You don't feel like you are at the end like Mandalay and Wynn.  

The biggest plus for me is the casino.  It has a very hip vibe and isn't huge like most casino's in Vegas.  It doesn't take you 20 mins to get to your room from the front door.

I thought it was even cooler to have the ""underground mall"" that was unlike anything I have ever seen before. But, hey, it's Vegas, innit? Stores upon stores upon stores upon places to eat and drink... wow. 

There was so much to do here - just at this one location - that I didn't feel much need to check out other hotels, although I was told I needed to, since each one boasts their own ""appeal."" 

I'd definitely consider staying at this hotel again. The room, with two queen-sized beds, was spacious, clean and offered up a HUGE bathroom, which was good, considering I shared the room with two other ladies. 

Plus, since I got a bit too inebriated (let's face it, i was hammered) one night and spent around 5 hours passed out at the base of the toilet, I'd say even the bathroom floor deserves 4 stars!",0,0,0

We had a room facing the strip but what good did that do when the windows were caked with dirt not only that but our room wasn't very clean and the hallways looked dirty with lifted stained carpet and chiped paint. That was a little disappointing, there was lime and rust around the faucets in the bathroom which I get happens but I rarely see that at nice hotels.

We are faithful Harrah's Properties guests and they comp us very fairly! This was our first PH stay and we really enjoyed it! My partner and I are both in our 40's and come to Vegas twice a year. We found PH to be young and hip and very Vegas... We liked the energy and style. Service was good right from the front desk and everywhere there after. The location in the center strip can't be beat and the views can be spectacular. Definately request strip\/fountain views. The room was cleaned to our satisfaction daily though maybe showing some nicks and dings and wear... We will not complain because the price was great and the suite pretty darn awesome. We asked for a Panarama Suite and got 1601 on the 16th floor ...facing MGM\/NYNY etc but the panaramic view was wonderful! We watched sunsets and rises and the strip lights...awesome! Be sure to soak in the huge tub! Use the wet bar for evening parties and coffee in the morning! The beds were comfortable and above average but maybe could be more luxurious? Lots of high styled furniture and movie memorabilia! We found we stayed in the room more than on trips when we stay in lesser rooms. The Miracle mile shops will keep you captivated for days... And the food choices are plentiful! Both offer a a range of price from very affordable to higher end. Again, we found ourselves more content staying on the property this trip due to all it had to offer! I will attach a few pics and hopefully a video tour of the room... Lastly, we are BIG Vegas fans... We come and stay often and we must say PH gets 2 big thumbs up for value, location, service and fun!",2,0,1

CUSTOMER SERVICE:  We flew a red eye & arrived by 10AM.  Being exhausted from the flight, we asked if we could check in early & they not only let us, they didn't charge a fee.  They were really nice about everything the whole wknd & we definitely thought the 'ANYTHING\/ANYTIME' speed dial was a great touch!

Visit only I would never stay here again. 1st thing The valet was only open to 7 star VIP members so I had to use the self park. It's a 8-10 minute walk from the self park to the front desk where you hopefully will get someone who speaks clearly. 

So it's my first time staying at this casino and as all Vegas casinos are very large it's easy to get lost. I received extremely vague directions to where I needed to go from self parking to get to my room and when I did ask other Employees most of the responses were rude and hurried. 

Once I got to my room I try the room keys to find out they don't work and oh there is a maid still cleaning my room. I checked in at 10:45 PM Why the hell is a maid still cleaning rooms that late and why did I have to get up there to find out my keys don't work and room not ready.

After going back down to the front desk I was asked by a manager well what do you want me to do? He offered to comp my resort fees but big deal $30 off this place is a joke worst customer service, hardest place to check in longest walk to your room just all around terrible experience trying to stay at this hotel.",2,0,0

the 3 things that annoyed me:
- when we were making sure we had everything out of our room before leaving, we checked under the bed and there was a ton of crap under the bed from used towels to just trash.  and for some reason there were some cheese puffs in the bathroom by the toilet like someone got trashed and was eating cheese puffs while throwing up and spilled the cheese puffs.  kinda gross, but we didnt' notice it earlier
- the placement of the room was annoying as it always seemed loud in the room from who knows what.  the sounds i was able to pick up were the traffic on the strip, and airplanes from the airport.  we were on the 20th floor so i am not sure why the traffic was so loud, and not sure why we would here the airplanes as last time we stayed on the 23rd floor in the resort room and we didn't hear any sounds.  and the resort room was far more comfortable as far as room and bed comfort.
- the other thing that kinda pissed me off was the staff at check in and check out.  last time when we stayed here, the guy at the desk at check in was really chill and hooked us up with room upgrades (upgrade to resort room and high floor comp'd) but when i asked the guy this time about upgrades he was talking about how slow it is at the casino and that we would have to pay $50 a night for the room upgrade.  i told him that i got it comp'd for 2 rooms a week ago when i was there and he told me that wasn't possible and gave me a bunch of crap so i just told him that we would keep our basic room.  at check out when we told the lady about the crap under our room she said ""oh, alright.  ill take it into consideration.""  what the hell is that?  no offering to make up for your staff not being able to properly clean a room?

overall, i would give it a 3 for this time, and mixed with my previous 5 from last time, it balances out to a 4.  we shall see if next time is a better experience if i stay here and don't upgrade to the westgate towers.",0,0,0

THey had my favorite game a Rocky Horror picture show game that had me sitting there for a good half hour, not that I was winning but that I could sit there and listen to the snippets of the songs from my favorite movie.

It is seriously super convenient since it's center of the strip. Quick walk to MGM, Montr Carlo, Bellagio, etc. I was amazed at how walking felt so much faster or nicer since I stayed central to the strip. 

However, that and the size of my room (2 queens, a huge bathroom with shower and tub) was probably the highlight of my 3 day stay here. It was spacious although old.

 Omgosh it took me almost 30 mins to find the stupid lobby for check-in. I was not only frustrated, but had high anxiety from all the mall crowd, casino crowd and center attraction crowd that I almost gave up looking for my lobby to check in. I was that lost. And it's not like it's easiest to spot or the signs are clear because they're not. They're hidden or bring u in circles. Quite the headache. Not to mention the hidden elevators from the main floor to try and get to your room. It was too crowded and big for my liking.

The room: although spacious for 2 queens and the MOST comfortable of beds...the bathroom often smelled like sewage\/poop. I thought it was us, until I kept smelling it in the mornings when I brushed my teeth or randomly at night when we were getting ready to go out. There is rust on the bathroom faucets and creepy celebrity knacks as decor in the room. Tacky and haunting haha. The channels on tv were mediocre when I wanted something to watch for downtime. But ur not supposed to be spending time in ur room anyway in Vegas. 

Overall, it was clean and housekeeping kept it well. Aside from the smell and old stuff in the bathroom, I enjoyed my bed more than I should have and it sort of overlooked the huge throngs of people. I would not stay again unless I was desperate and lazy because it's too crowded for my liking. But I would recommend it sure.",5,2,1

While I don't have other Vegas hotels to compare Planet Hollywood to, I can't imagine anything worst. My room was dark, dirty and depressing. The bed was made with a sheet (no other covers) and 2 pathetically uncomfortable pillows - both of which reeked of cigarettes and stale beer (even though I had booked a non-smoking room). The maid's cleaning supplies were left in the bathtub... The few lamps that were in the room were unplugged, and I quickly realized why -there were not enough outlets to plug them all in. The only source of light was one tiny desk lamp. As I unpacked in my dingy room, I found that the safe didn't work. I made a call to the front desk, had to leave a message, and never heard back. Ended up just wearing all of my valuables the entire weekend so I didn't need to worry about them. Also, there was no mini-fridge.. which I thought was bizarre- especially for Vegas.  

Luckily I was able to keep myself busy enough to avoid being in my room at all cost, but on my last night, I decided to order room service. After finishing my cold meal, I pushed the room service cart out to the hallway- and I forgot my room key.. leaving me locked out of my room (in my bare feet and PJs). I went down to the lobby to ask for a new key card, and they told me I needed ID (which obviously was in my room). They told me to go back up and wait by my door - assured me maintenance would be there in 5 minutes. 30 minutes later and no show by the maintenance guy, I went BACK down to the lobby, still mortified in my PJs, to let them know I was still waiting... they showed no sympathy, nothing. Just told me to keep waiting- apparently the maintenance guy had received a ""medic call""? What maintenance man is responsible for a medic call?? He finally showed up an hour later, all nonchalant, reeking of pot, and let me in- DID NOT even ask for my ID, so not sure why that was so important for the front desk...

We stayed here June 15-17. When we first got there our room wasn't ready but the guy gave us an upgrade to a studio room. OMG.  The room was bigger than our old apartment in San Diego. A view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. The bathroom was just about as big as the room itself. Our room had a sitting area with Forrest Gump memorabilia and the funny thing is that it's my all time favorite movie. That was a fun surprise. The tub was big enough for two to fit comfortable and relax. 

The best part was The Miracle Mile of Shops was right downstairs. 

I really don't have too much to complain about except the buffet was just ok. For $27.99 per person you would think the food would taste better than other places but it didn't. I liked that they had a huge variety (American, Mexican, Italian...), if you get the coupon book from customer service I think you can get a 2 for 1  in the book.

I booked through Hotwire as a '4 star near the center strip' area. Location wise this is correct. But I don't think it warrants 4 stars. The casino is madness though - it's EXACTLY what you think of when you think of Vegas. Gamblers, women dancing on stage, drinks flowing, partying.

One final note: checkin line is always long here. They were very polite though but it took us 20 minutes to get through it and get into our room.

Biggest complaint the Water Pressure in the shower and tub was LOUSY

They had to have had water restrictors on the shower heads.  I swear the pressure coming out of the sink was better than the shower and who doesn't love taking a relaxing shower or bath when you're on vacation?   I filled the bath and it took literally 30minutes to fill that tub.   Great tub.. LOUSY water pressure.

I stayed in newly renovated room on the 37th floor with a great view of the fountain.  2 other folks I spoke with had similar experience.

The other complaint;  OUTSIDE NOISE.  

I'm a light sleeper and you wouldn't think a high end hotel would have windows that would let the sound in.  I was in Vegas on training for a week so I needed to sleep early and wake up early.   It wasn't good.     I won't stay here again unless it's unavoidable.

No one helped us with our bags when we arrived, there is no mini bar in the room, our maid didn't take out the garbage, didn't put away the ironing board, and didn't straighten anything up. All she did was make the bed and put two new towels in. Very basic.

I had an offer for a free room and $250.00 in free play. I called made my reservations confirmed my free play a couple times while making the reservation. I checked in at VIP and was told that I had $250 in free play and to go to the rewards counter. I went to the rewards center around 5:00 p.m.  and was told my free play was not available. I asked why not and they gave me a song and dance and kept me waiting until 10:45 p.m. With one excuse after another. Each person kept passing the buck. Needless to say we did not stay and will never spend another dime with any Caesars property.  Poor customer service.,2,0,0

I could rent a fridge for $25 a day. At the end of my trip I could have bought a new mini fridge for that price. Come on, how was I supposed to survive for 5 days?! This really made my trip crappy.

We booked a cabana for the day and when we got there, there was some confusion about the time booked and we had shown up later than we had booked. Within 5 minutes, Michael (I assume the manager) was correcting the issue and had us in a cabana poolside with no issues. He then stopped by an hour later just to make sure we were taken care of after he fixed OUR mistake, not theirs. Vegas is so busy, and I have never in my life received such amazing service in Vegas chaos, especially when the mistake was ours in the first place. If I could give more than five stars I would.

Had spent a good bit of time at the sports book and casino here on a prior trip while staying at another hotel, and really liked the vibe. So, when it came time for the next trip with Mrs., I checked reviews here and saw lots of ups and downs concerning staff, service, and housekeeping, but the rates and location made me roll the dice anyway. 

Check-in and Check-out were both smooth. We rented a car, so we used the valet every day, some days on multiple occasions, and always received courteous and mostly timely service. I've seen differing reports, but during our stay, our housekeeping and room quality was stellar.

We hit up the Earl of Sandwich on a particularly drunky and late night, and it was really good. We also hit up The Spice Market buffet as part of the 24 hour Buffet of Buffets deal, but thats a separate review....I will say the Spice Market delivered nicely. The casino is nice, clean, and well serviced. I just wish that in the wee hours and slow daytimes, you could find a $5 table here, but I understand it's the heart of the strip. This kind of property isn't going under $10 at any time. The only playing I did here was on the penny slots, and there was no discrimination at all with the drink service, something I truly appreciate.

The Venetian gives a new member to their rewards a t shirt and gift, the Golden Nugget gives you $10 match play at the tables and $5 slot credit with a new membership, El Cortez will give you free credits or ice cream, another casino (can't recall the name) will give you a deck of played casino cards with the date and time of when those cards were used at a table marked on them.

Yes, we stayed in the Jodie Foster hotel room, and for the ""girls vegas outting"", Jodie fit right in!

Parking was a bit weird... they were doing construction on the strip right out in front, so the back alley drive was... okay. Don't park in the Miracle Mile shop area, even though it says you can park there for the hotel.... just don't do it! Go Valet!!! The boys are cute and sweet and they take care of everything!

Check in was okay... came in on Friday afternoon, so I knew there was going to be a long line. The atmosphere and design of this hotel is AWESOME! I came to the Heart Bar back in March and knew where I was staying the next time I came out to Vegas.

The room was nice, clean, comfortable chairs and beds, large bathroom... just overall good... esp for the cheapest I could get. 

Room service was super sweet! It was this nice, older lady who brought up our mixers (OJ, CranJuice, Coke, Club Soda, etc.) for the ""Drinks on Us"" deal PH was having (free bottle of vodka per night), and she set it all up and acted like our mom, making sure we were ok, had enough towels and food to eat, that we becareful... she was our 5 minute Vegas-Mom!

Check out was pretty simple and pain-free. Nice people at the front\/lobby desk. Not too long a line (Sunday at 11am).

Bus boy didn't give me a ticket for our luggage though before he took them downstairs, so we had a little problem with lost luggage. Thankfully the valet guys helped us girls out and helped us go looking for the luggage. Those sweethearts! :)

We arrived on a busy weekend and the first we noticed was Valet was full.  Fine, no biggie and I'm used to parking myself.  However, carrying your bags through the mall, then the casino to get down the front desk felt like it took forever, and also felt a little awkward.  Toss in the fact the Brittney Spears throw up all over the place just turned me off.  I'm not a fan of her, although I understand the draw, I don't need to see her every time I enter an elevator.  They now have a Brittany Slot Machine where you can get a ""Toxic"" win.  Ug.

Per some other reviews, even the Platinum line was long and slow at check in \/ check out.  I know you can check out from your room, but if you want to use reward credits, the front desk needs to process the check out.  

The room was basic and needs an upgrade, along with the hallways.  It just wasn't super warm or inviting.  

The casino is pretty standard.  Great dealers, but I noticed they haven't upgraded their slots in a while.  Restaurants thought-out the mall are plentiful and pretty good.  Their buffet is in a basement and while the food is OK, not a very inviting space.  

Hopefully Caesar's has this on their list for a re-branding after their bankruptcy is taken care of.",6,3,2

I've stayed at numerous hotels, and the Hard Rock used to be my go-to place, but has gone downhill in recent years.  So on my recent trip, I was looking to try a new place and I heard good things about PH.  I was a little concerned about the pool, because it's pretty hard to beat the Hard Rock pool area.  My friend and I found absolutely no issues with the hotel.  Our room was clean and we had a great view of the strip - although it would have been nice to have a better sound system in the room (such as a Bose Wave).  The Spice Market Buffet offers a great selection of food, and I highly recommend.  Just prepared for a long wait if you go there in the evening on the weekend.  The casino had plenty of table games and slots and beautiful dealers.  However, the place I spent the most time was at the pool.  On the weekends, it's a really fun atmosphere.  And I didn't feel like the Pool Bar was ripping me off.  I found the bucket of five beers (mostly pints) for $34 to be a reasonable value for a Vegas pool.  If swimming or people watching isn't your thing, you play cornhole (free), or pool (I think it's $1\/game) and ping pong.  There is also a blackjack area away from the pools where you can get your gambling fix without having to go down to the casino (I did).  Also, there are some great cheap eats in the hotel or in the mall at the hotel, and there's even a Walgreens on the exterior corner of the hotel with lots of alcohol and snacks so you really don't need to leave.

First thing is valet was blocked off and no one was standing there to answer any questions,  such as to give directions or how you could drop someone off. This was a start of a very unclassy experience. 

Had to walk quite a distance from the garage to the check in desk. Not a good hotel to stay at for the elderly. The check in line didn't seem to take to long for a Friday during the beginning of check ins. Got to the counter and they wouldn't let me check in because it was under my mother's name. Well my mother is the miracle mile sitting down halfway from check in to the garage because of the frigging walk. It's a miracle she didn't have a heart attack. 

Before I left the check-in desk the employee and a supervisor\/manager who came out offered to have security to get a wheelchair for my mom but they wouldn't be able to assist her until she made it to the casino because miracle mile is separate. The type also told me to skip the line and come back to see them. When we made it back, which wasn't too long the employee and the supervisor\/manager were nowhere to be found. We waited and waited until finally one of the other employees helped us.

We finally make it to the room and I call for utensils and they charge an $8 service fee to deliver them. What the hell do we get to take them home? I did ask for them and waited for 25 minutes before I cancelled because it was taking too long.

I am a guy which I do love seeing half naked beautiful women dancing but found it very weird that the gogo girls were not just dancing in the bars but in the middle of the gambling table areas. They had plenty of these dancers but can't even spare more valet or someone outside the valet full gate to answer questions.

The rooms are okay but nothing special. When someone in another room takes a shower it sounds like they are in your room taking a shower. It is so loud it reminds me of some two bit hotel. Oh and of course the little kids running around in the next room. Who brings little kids to Vegas? Put these families in another area of the hotel. 

At no time did this place offer to upgrade the room, offer complimentary tickets to a show, etc.

The rest of the gaming tables are tight as well and the layout of the playing area is not well laid out.  You will get easily lost and finding your way out to the strip is confusing.

Planet Hollywood is located smack in the middle o' the strip making it incredibly easy to get around. 

BurgR on the casino floor has a great craft beer selection that runs you ~$7 for a 20 oz. cup. Not too shabby.

$5 dollar 3-card poker and craps tables available on off-peak days, all day. Crystal and Olya at the passion pit won me $300. Sure they're scantily clad but they know their stuff brought me some good luck.

But really, in retrospect, it *was* actually a nice hotel.  So far, it's the nicest place I've stayed in in Vegas, and I've also been to Paris, Bally's, and the Stratosphere.  The really surprising thing, though, is that it's not very expensive.

Our room was quite affordable, clean, and spacious.  One downside is that you have to pay for Internet, but it seems like you have to pay no matter where you stay in Vegas.  You can get free-ish wi-fi at The Coffee Bean in the nearby shopping mall-- 8 hours if you buy a cup of coffee.  Not too shabby.

Like the other hotels, PH also has free parking, although it's a bit of a walk since it's at the far end of the attached shopping mall.  One tip: if you're an impatient fast-walker (like me), you can very quickly get to the parking garage by exiting the hotel at the lowest level, which is where cab pickups and dropoffs are.

The in-room movie props were amusing (we had the Die Hard room), but that was about it.  The decor of the hotel is pretty nice, though, and their casino seems to have a respectable ventilation system, because the cigarette smoke wasn't very noticeable unlike other places.

Also-- it seems like you can get better rates by NOT pre-booking in Vegas.  Every time I've pre-booked I've paid substantially more than if I had just walked into a place.  Since we arrived ""late"" at PH (like 3PM or something), our first night was only $45.

The hotel is centrally located on the strip, so it's an easy walk to most destinations in either direction. 

I can't really comment on the casino because I don't gamble, but we enjoyed several of the bars in the casino. There is a starbuck's in the casino which is nice, but I'm pretty sure all of the casinos have at least one. There is also a nice little mall connected to the casino with 'normal' stores, not those crazy designer stores that they have in the forum shops. 

Check-in and check-out were smooth and easy. Our room was average size, clean and the bed and pillows were quite comfortable. wireless internet was $14\/day which is ridiculous, but luckily we had our our personal hotspot. They have a nice spa but again, the prices were ridiculous. Of course, this seems to be typical for Vegas these days.

The wedding we attended here gets the record for fastest wedding ever - less than 10 minutes from start to finish, but it was a very nice ceremony and a nice little chapel (despite the shouts from those watching the NCAA tournament just outside the door)

My friends had comps for free rooms and PH so they got 2 rooms -- one for them and one for the boyfriend and me. I know my friends would have complaints because the first person they spoke to when checking in was a bitch, but w\/ some persistence we got nice rooms!

We were on the 26th floor right very close to the elevator! Our room was very nice. We had the usual amenities -- 2 queen beds, closet, desk, spacious bathroom, etc. We had a shower AND a tub so that was pretty cool. When I stayed at New York New York, they had an alarm clock that you could attach your iPhone to. PH didn't have that...

Each room had different famous items behind some glass. My friend's room had a bloody shirt from some movie I think (I forgot to check which movie) and some dirty ass socks. Our room had a syringe and something else that freaked me out but I forgot what it was. Also, there was little to no lighting. Our window was pretty small which could've been a factor, but still.They need to provide more lighting! It bothered my friend so much that she called and asked for an extra lamp.

We had to park at the first parking structure we could find which was the parking structure that attaches to the Miracle Mile Shop. It was a pretty long walk to our hotel room from there. That was a pretty big pain.

So basically we go in to the Planet Hollywood and I stop to ask for directions at the Westgate Kiosk at the Miracle Mile Shops right next to Cabo Wabo, and honestly the Westgate employees could not be more rude & unprofessional. First off, I try to ask one of the men for assistance when I notice he is talking on the phone while on duty, it is because of this that he rudely tells me to ask someone else for assistance & not bother him because he's on the phone, so then I ask one of the women working there and she pretty much says is SO rude to me, she basically said that she didn't feel like helping me and to go away. She pretty much just told me to fuck off. I had not one but TWO employees be completely rude to me when I was just asking for some assistance. Horrible costumer service, I left the Planet Hollywood as soon as possible, if that's how their employees act & that's how they condone their employees to treat guests. The worst part is that I actually filed a complaint against those employees, I even took a picture of them and sent it to management to show them who they were, and Planet Hollywood Management DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT IT. I guess Planet Hollywood doesn't care that their employees mistreat customers & guests. I gladly left the hotel ASAP and have not been back. It's Planet Hollywood's loss, me and my girlfriend were planning on going shopping nonstop at the Miracle Mile Shops, eat at the PF Changs inside the Planet Hollywood, hang out at Koi Lounge, get a snack at the Pin Up Pizza and have my countless of relatives & friends visiting Vegas all stay at the Planet Hollywood.

- Location location location. Near a lot of the hot casinos and a cheap cab ride for most others
-  The buffet! Not too expensive and loads of good food!
- Very clean rooms with flat screen TVs and the themes are fun too (We got Titanic)
- Free valet if you stay though they are so overworked that you might get your car faster if you park it yourself
- Shopping!!
- Seeing the fountain show at the Bellagio from the window

The not so good:
- Longest check-in line ever. Wtf? They have like 3 people working on the weekends. Took forever and there is no where to sit down. Annoying
- Pool area is huge with a nice view and the DJ is fun (if a bit too loud) but the pools are small and there are always a million kids running around screaming and splashing. I mean you have every right to bring your kid to Vegas (though why I have no idea) but I am trying to relax and I don't want to have your kids splashing me the whole time. Unpleasant. The lounge chairs are also pretty damn old and unless you get there early to nab one of the few comfortable ones, be prepared go hunting for a half-way decent one. 

Overall I enjoyed my stay here and although it wasn't perfect, the location really made up for any other annoyances. Perhaps they could throw in an ""adults only"" pool?",3,1,2

When I asked the concierge for help and told him of my displeasure of having to trek thru the shops and hotel he took his pen out and started to write something. Then he says to me ""ill send your request to the architect so they can redesign the hotel"". Really?! I'm totally serious when I say they have the worst staff for giving directions. And, why does Planet Hollywood have employees wearing Westgate Hotel uniforms giving out information and directions? If this place is being run by the Westgate I know why the place is so bad!

My room was horrible! Electrical cords lying on the floor, chipped furniture, old furniture, bad carpet and absolutely no padding under the carpet. I might as well have been walking outside on the concrete barefoot. The walls were stained with whatever they used to fix the holes, the lampshade has stains that looked like either ketchup or blood. . .

Do no book a room here until the renovations are completed, and even after that I would be hesitant. My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights, and if I knew them what I know now, I wouldn't have wasted my time or money.

The casino itself is smaller than other casinos on the strip, and it's very dark. 

We only ate at one restaurant at the resort, the Spice Market Buffet, and it was not worth the money. For 2 people, we spent $60 for the champagne brunch. The food was only so-so and we had to hunt down a server to get 1 mimosa. Not worth the price!

The real problem with this resort is the renovations...

We reserved a renovated Ultra Hip room for 3 nights. After a 5 and a half hour plane ride, we were given a larger but clearly older room. We are generally flexible people, and since we only planners to sleep in the room we didn't let the age of the room bother us. Aside from being a little tacky (it was decorated with Indiana Jones memorabilia) and dark, the room was clean and had a bed. 

Next time, I will ask for- no, DEMAND- a new room. 

On April 24th, at 10 AM, construction started on the room directly above ours. We did not take time off from our jobs and spend our hard earned money to sleep in a construction zone. It's one of our pet peeves. 

Please note, that while 10 AM sounds late, we had been up late the night before. In fact, I can guarantee we were not the last people to crawl into bed that night. 

First we called the front desk but could not hear them because of how loud the noise was above us. Then we went down to the desk where we were promptly reassigned to a renovated Ultra Hip room, you know, the one I originally reserved. They also waived our resort fees for the stay, but the damage was done, we were officially disgruntled guests. We refused to spend one more penny at the hotel. We gambled at New York, ate at Paris, and even got all our coffees at the Aria. 

I would love to know what incredible idiot at this resort thinks it's ok to reserve rooms when there is construction of adjacent floors.

Stayed there for 2 nights, non-smoking Hollywood Hip room on the 16th floor with a nice view. The view was the best part overlooking City Center West's Louis Vuitton store. At night, you can see a captivating monogram light show on the LV roof. 

The ugly: 
Water took at least 20 minutes to heat up. 
Shower head very crusty and moldy (I should've took a picture to gross you out). 
Toilet is dirty underneath the rim. When I was wiping myself, you could clearly see the black mold starring at you. 
Bathroom had poor ventilation. 
Lights in room worked 50% and were hard to get to. The lights were dimly lit. The floor lamp shade was broken. 
Queen bed was quite lumpy and sheets were thin. 
No mini fridge. 
No tub, no shower mats, and no complimentary shower cap for the wife. 


On the up-side:

- southwest airlines package included a $5 coupon off the buffet with our package but we couldn't use it because it was a ""holiday"" menu.  This is probably more an issue with Southwest...
- small fridge in room would have been nice.
- when we wanted light we turned on every light in the room and it was still dark.  It was probably for ambience but at that moment we wanted light.

We had bellhop service, and I knew the wristlet was in the outside pocket of my luggage because as my bag was put on the bellhop cart I put an item into the luggage pocket and saw my wristlet.

15 minutes later my luggage arrives in my room and the outside pocket zipper is open and the wristlet is missing. The other item is there, but not the small purse.

I called the front desk to ask about filing a complaint and they transferred me to Bell Hop because the wristlet probably fell out.  I shared that I just seen the small purse a few minutes prior, and I understand that it's not that big of deal for a hotel of this size, but I thought they should be aware that they may have a staffing issue.

The Bell Hop desk completely ignored my concerns and told me to hang on while they 'look for it'.   
Of course... it wasn't found.
Click. Hang up.

I'm in my mid-50s, the item that went missing is about $50, not a lot of money, but easy to grab and hide.

My advice:   Lock your luggage and beware of bell hop service!

This place will ignore you if you have any problems with the Bell Hop.. looking at recent reviews, it looks like I'm not the first person to have an item go missing when utilizing the Bell Hop service.

Attempted to use a $25 match play coupon for roulette.  I first went to ""Guest Services"" to inquire as to the procedure.  She did not have a clue, but directed me to the ""Player's Club"".  Went there next, and that employee also did not have a clue.  He directed me to the cashier's cage.  I go there and am told to take the coupon directly to the dealer (no voucher or anything else needed).  

So I next take the coupon to the roulette dealer.  This is now the 4th Planet Hollywood Casino employee I have dealt with.  The dealer didn't know what to do, and so called her supervisor.  This supervisor glanced briefly at the coupon and shook his head NO, that they wouldn't honor it.  So I asked to speak with his supervisor (now employee #6).  She comes over.  She is very pleasant and tries to be helpful.  She examines the coupon closely and just isn't sure what to do.  She tries to send me to the Player's Club (nope...already been there, they're not interested), then tries to send me back to the cashier's cage (nope.....already been there, they're not interested either).  Then she decides that they won't honor the coupon because it mentions something about the former A-List Players Club (rather than the current Total Rewards Club since Harrah's took over)......however she will call her boss on the phone (now employee #7).  So after waiting another 10-15 minutes, her unseen boss also says NO, they won't honor the coupon.  

So I proceed to take down names and job titles and plan to file a formal complaint with Harrah's corporate offices.  I had a valid coupon that I purchased.  It clearly said 'PLANET HOLLYWOOD"", which is exactly where I was at, and that it expired 12\/31\/2010, and that it was good for up to a $25.00 match bet on any table game in the Casino.  

Coupon holders BEWARE.  You will be given the run around and treated shabbily at PLANET HOLLYWOOD CASINO.  The employees there, including the Supervisors, do not have a clue what they're doing when dealing with marketing coupons.",2,0,0

But decided to upgrade to Resort Vista room. The size of the room was good and the view of the strip was awesome. However, the room it's self was old. My husband said it best, ""Nice room, but rough around the edges."" The room was extremely dusty  (I HATE DUST), The bathroom was big.. the shower was old and looked like something you would shower in while at summer camp (or jail... Not that I've been).. The tub (which was big, but I'd never use hotel tubs) overlooked the strip was *NICE*!! There was a separate area with a toilet and bidet. The bidet was gross.. I hope people aren't using it! The sink faucets were all rusty and not appealing at all. The bed was big and comfy.. Clean at least!! Again, this place is in need of major upgrades. This was definitely not what i expected for the Planet Hollywood. The reason for the 3 stars is because the concierge folks were extremely nice and helpful and the casino was great... However, don't think I'd opt to stay here again.",8,3,2

We got a deal through a 3rd party site, so that was the only reason we chose to stay here. When checking in, the guy helping us told us we had a $25 food\/bev credit for the trip, and when we asked him if it was each day and where we could use it he excused himself to ask someone and then came back to tell us it was each day, and we could use it anywhere. We just had to charge it to the room and they would apply the credit. He also said there was a resort fee (there always is) that includes internet and the gym. We however learned you, again, had to charge these things to the room and then they would apply the credit. The internet is only for one device, and didn't work majority of the time.

Our room had a beautiful view of the roof, literally 6 inches from the bottom of our window. We couldn't even see beyond the roof. The bathroom had this weird double door that didn't close\/lock\/shut at all. The room was themed (ours was Fifth Element), which meant there were a bunch of pictures from the movie hung up instead of tacky hotel paintings, and there were ""props"" from the movie on display in the corner. The props were not cool, neat, or deserving of the amount of space they took up in the room to display.

Our bathroom was gross and outdated, the lights in the bathroom would go out if you plugged in anything to the bathroom socket (no joke, the girlfriend plugged in the blow dryer and the lights went out). We had to reset the plug but was still quite humorous. Our iron didn't heat beyond luke warm, and our telephone on the desk in the room didn't work. Thank god there was a second one. We had to call down for turn down service because we were never up and out of the room by 8 am, when the housekeeping attendants would come by. We didn't even find the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign until the last day (it was tucked behind some promotional junk on the door).

The TV in the room promised movies, services, and express checkout. The promotional junk they give you with your key even had channels listed with information on restaurants, concerts, and all the nightlife. Too bad the TVs only had low def feeds of 12 channels (CNN, ESPN, ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, TBS, Telemundo are the only ones i can remember). Any channel over 13 was met with a loud high pitch beep that sounded like a smoke alarm. The Menu button did nothing, and ultimately you were left watching fuzzy garbage in between going out and getting ready.

The pool had potential but is simply a large slab area with two pools, one family friendly and one 21+ with a DJ. The DJ is set up right next to a handful of chairs and daybeds and is deafening. The pools are no bigger than the standard community pool. All the seating around the pool is by rental only ($60 a day for the daybeds). The rest of the chairs are out of sight, in the sun, and I'm not confident enough to say they would have been a good place to leave anything since I didn't see ANY security. No outside drinks, by the way, so make sure you chug your complimentary cocktails you just got downstairs and find a place to ditch the glass, because you will be sent away.

The daybeds were $60 and we were told that they were yours for the day. The daybeds were covered in bird crud and not very nice, but they did have an umbrella and a side table and were in sight of the pool. For that reason alone we got one for the day. When we decided to go eat lunch we asked if we had to do anything, or if when we came back we would need to get a new bed. The guy reassured us that the bed we had picked and been on would be ours all day. Not 2 hours later we got back and the bed was not only being used, but all the beds were now taken. We asked the new guy there to help us and he told us to go ask if they had their wristband (their only way of decyphering who paid and who didn't). Apparently this was our job now. We made a stink about it and all they did was find us a pair of chairs right next to the DJs speaker and said ""There you go"". So much for customer service.

Upon checkout, we found out the places we used our credits didn't work for the credit, and were handed a list of places we could use it. Where the heck was this when we checked in?! They said they would take it off, and then still charged us for it all. We had to call it in, and are still awaiting our refund they recently promised us.

Never, never, never ever ever again will I stay at this dump hole. They put no money, charm or class behind their hotel that they put into their casino. Not family-friendly or family oriented. If you're there to get trashed and need a room to sleep in (not bathe or hangout by the pool at) just sleep this is a great place for you. But if you need to spend more than 5 minutes in the room, you are wasting every penny on this dump.",3,0,0

Stayed here for 4 days for the Miss Vietnam USA pageant. I was there to pass down my title of Second Runner Up 2006-2007. Congrats to the girls who placed this year.

There are 51 floors and I got to stay on floor 50, Penthouse. It was beautiful. Fresh fruits on my table, huge ass mofuggin bathroom, my living room, kitchen. It was great! It helps to know the Vice President of Planet Hollywood, muahahah 

I got lucky twice this time. One, I was standing in my hallway and these 2 butlers came up to me and said I was really pretty , wanted to take pictures with me, told me that whatever room service I needed they would take care of it. SCORE!! I asked them to bring soup for my friend in my penthouse because she was sick. So she got a nice suprise.

Second time, I was walking down my hallway towards the elevator again when a maid stopped me to tell me I look pretty (blush). I thanked her and pointed to a double door at the end of the hallway where I saw a huge couch and TV down a corridor. I asked her who's room is that and why is it so huge. She told me ""Oh that room belongs to the owner of Planet Hollywood....Wanna go see?"" HELL YES!! they were cleaning it so they let me in to look around. The place was AMAZING. The bedroom is bigger than my living room at home! I thanked her and bid her a good day. 

On we go. The decor of the whole hotel itself is spectacular. The main pieces you see are the big glass crystal balls and the crystal curtains on every floor. The shopping center has all the designer brands to make me melt and the food is superb. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The security is polite. The bathrobes are soft :]

A few of the places are still under construction. The swimming pool for instance. The only reason I got to take a look in the water and whatnot is because I did a quick shoot there. It looks promising!

Pros: 
-Clean room
-There is a tub in our bathroom! (Didn't expect that because we just got a standard room but HEY, we won't complain!)
-The staff was very nice & helpful

Cons:
-The self parking garage is literally in the Miracle Mile Mall and its one hell of a walk to and from there. 
-They charged us a $28 early check in fee on a Tuesday morning. Everyone else on Yelp said it was only $16?! Did we get ripped off?!

So prior to booking our actual stay at Planet Hollywood, my boyfriend and I initially only wanted to go to Vegas to do the Buffet of Buffets deal. We saw that PlanetHollywood had a package deal that included the room plus 2 BoB passes! SCORE! He booked the hotel and was charged $215 but at check out he had to pay an addition $72?! Wow.. That's a total of $287 for two nights and 2 24hr BoB passes.. Each pass was $49 so the room itself was about $94 (including that ridiculous $20 resort fee, boo). 

Don't get me wrong, this was a great hotel. Better than Luxor ill tell you that's for sure! But man their early check in fee plus those resort fees will put a hole in ur wallet lol. It was worth it though because of the hotels location! I would def stay here again, but not do the BoB deal to save some money :)",1,1,2

Good check in experience turned bad when we got to our room, which is dirty:  obvious dust on the desk and furniture, dirty bathroom floors, old brackets still on walls from whatever items were removed who knows when.  I call the front desk, explained the room was dirty and asked to be moved to a different room.  After a 5 minute hold, the clerk pops back on and says...""you want an upgraded room?"" to which I reply, ""not necessarily...I just want a CLEAN room!""  Back on hold for another 6 minutes, at which time she comes back on and says ""The only available upgrades tonight are $100 per room"" which I decline, saying I just want a CLEAN room, which she says she doesn't have (on a Tuesday night in Sept?) and she offers to send up the housekeeper, which I decline because I'm tired and it's now just after midnight.  If I had known the sheets had blood spots on them at that time I was have demanded the housekeeper come and change them....just noticed this morning when we got up.  YUCH!  This place may not be brand new, but I DO expect a few basics in a hotel room:  clean sheets, clean furniture, and a coffee maker would be a good start, plus a front desk person who actually gives a darn about customer's comfort.  Am hoping they redeem themselves today because we are attending a conference here for the next three days.

Update after 24 hours here:
It got worse!  The shower doesn't get hot, only lukewarm, even though the sink and tub get hot water.  We asked for them to have a technician fix the shower mixer valve today.  When we returned to our room at 7:30 pm after being gone all day, the room hadn't been serviced by housekeeping!  We called the front desk who promised to send someone right away to clean the room and the housekeeper showed up after about 20 minutes.

The technician who was supposed to fix the shower had come earlier in the day but said the shower was as hot as it was going to get as the shower mixer valve needed to be replaced and they'd have to tear into the wall....not going to happen.

We went to the front desk and asked to speak to a manager.  After several minutes of listening to another guest complain about her room to another front desk clerk who obviously didn't care, she walked off and said she'd never stay here again.  DITTO!  The manager did appear finally, asked what the problem was and proceeded to type into the computer without comment while we told her about the issues.  Finally after I asked her if she cared, she told us she'd type the info into the computer but there was nothing she could do and no other rooms were available.  Unbelievable.

Planet Hollywood is one that we will never return to, nor will we ever reccommend to others. On most websites I found, this hotel was rated 4-5 stars. I would put it around 3 stars at the most. The hotel allows dogs and we counted four while we waited in line to check in. We could hear dogs barking on our floor all hours of the day. I had reserved a non-smoking room, but I was told that only smoking rooms were available upon our check-in and I was not comped for the inconvenience. The room didn't smell too badly, until we got into the bed and the smell of cigarettes wafted up from the sheets and most likely the mattress. The AC unit was broken and stuck on 60 degrees. It was a bit cold and there were no extra blankets in the room. I tried to reach Housekeeping in search of blankets on 3 occassions and the phone just rang and rang. The room was small for a King Suite and the shower was so small that my 6'0"" husband kept hitting his elbows on the shower walls as he washed. There was no uniformed or marked security anywhere that we could see in the hotel or casino and it became quickly obvious that any riff-raff off of the street was welcomed to roam the halls and enjoy the pool. There was no security check at the pool entrance to ensure only guests could enter. There was a large concrete slab filled with lawn chairs on the main level of the pool, no where near the water. There were two pools, above, on either side of that concrete slab. One pool was for 21 and older only, but offered no seating unless you wanted to rent a cabana or day bed for the day. I had planned on renting a cabana, but after seeing the set in stains and very dirty upholstery I reconsidered. We grabbed a slab of concrete close to the pool edge as we saw others doing and sat on our towels. We observed at least 15 people get kicked off of days beds that they hadn't rented. We paid $50 for a bucket of 5 beers. 5 lousy cans of beer, and we had to return the bucket! The other pool was for families and was much smaller with all of the floaties in the water. The area around the pool looked to only have 10-20 lawn chairs and did not accomodate everyone. We were awarded $25 a day  free food and drink with our Total Rewards points, but when we attempted to use them they were denied and we had to settle it with the Front Desk, and then they attempted to over charge us upon check out for the food & drink that was supposed to have been free. The best thing I can say about our stay is that the Yolos resaurant inside the casino is delicious! Tasy Mexican fare all seasoned perfectly and guacomole made to order and prepared table-side.

And let me tell you folks, that is the WORST. It's not a regular shower, and the curtain just blows around with the pressure of the water, basically semi-flooding the floor space. Needless to say, I was pretty ticked off so the next morning I called the front desk and switched to a regular room.

During the day, took the elevator down and shopped in the built in mall, Miracle Mile Shops and had an amazing lunch at Ramsay's Burgr in the hotel lobby. We know this hotel is very busy w\/ a young clientele so that probably explains the large scratches on the furniture but its no excuse for housekeeping not to check if several light bulbs are out. Again, these were cosmetic that can be easily fixed and we didn't plan to stay in the room all night. The bed was comfy and sheets were fresh. Bathroom was large and also squeaky clean. You get the standard writing desk, LCD screen, iron \/ board and a chair of course. The view was the icing on the cake but would have been better if the fountains were working but can't blame PH for that. Last thing, there was a bit of line during check in (took about 25 min at 7:45pm) but check out was a breeze...just drop off your card key in the express box. Will consider staying here again for the location but they need some touching up with the rooms.",0,0,0

This was one of the grossest, dirtiest, most disgusting hotels I have ever stayed in, and if it has been $60 a night, I would have been ok with it, but at $275\/night, I was disgusted.  Firstly google it on bed bug reports and you will see how many reports this hotel has received. First thing I did was go through my sheets and search for bed bugs, which is a really pleasant thing to do at $275\/night, let me tell ya.  Our room was so filthy it didn't look like housekeeping did anything other than make the bed and put a few new towels in the bathroom.  There were crumbs on the desk and desk chair, crumbs all over the floor (which clearly hasn't been vacuumed), hair all over the bathroom floor, and the last guest's soap and shampoo and body gel were still in the shower!!!! The soap dish was filthy with residue of the last person's soap all over it. There was dust all over the bedside table, the glasses had lip stains. I mean this place was filth!!! I couldn't walk barefoot in the room for fear of how dirty the floor was.  There were mysterious stains on the purple chair in the room that looked like bodily fluid, I'll just leave it at that.  On top of all of this, the TV was broken and didn't even turn on!!!  I hated this place so much, all weekend I had to just try and not let it ruin our vacation.  The casino was filthy, and the decor so unimpressive and had nothing to do with a Hollywood theme.  We saw Britney Spears perform which was fun, but I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone.... Not even my worst enemy!!! Oh, and when we checked in, they lost our reservation and we had to wait an hour for them to find it.  

The toilet paper was so cheap and harsh that they felt like Brillo pads- same goes for the towels.

The pool area was FILTHY.  They had ancient, disgusting chaise lounges- those cheap plastic ones that were common in the 80s- never hosed down, covered in black dirt.  On the sun decking area no one cleaned up the trash so it was impossible o find a chair that didn't have litter by it - beer cans and cigarette butts.  And the sun bathing area is far from the pool- so far they the pool isn't even within sight, so you literally feel like you are laying out in a parking lot.  Not just any parking lot, but a lot painted in white, so the area is blinding. The pool itself is so disgusting with spilled drinks inside of it that I wouldn't even get in it.

The rooms are quite nice ""The Hollywood Hip Room"" This hotel used to be the Aladdin, so there are traces of Aladdin like the knobs for the sink, etc. However, the room has been decorated with Hollywood memorabilia, large flat screen TV, and the beds are very comfortable with duvet sheets of course.

First of all, when you check into this hotel, make sure you valet your car. If you self park, you will have to walk the whole span of the Miracle Mile Shops to get to your room which is quite unfortunate. Valet is free except that you have to give them gratuity. 

If you are going to do some gambling, do it at night time where they have awesome clubbing music downstairs. It is a great opportunity to people watch as there are hotties roaming around. Also, the pleasure pit is where scantily clad women are dancing on the stripper poles enticing men to gamble their money away. 

If you don't feel like gambling, the Miracle Mile shops offer typical mall shopping especially if you need a new outfit to go out to the clubs. For eats, Earls is the best. It is cheap, open 24hrs, and has great sandwiches for that late night\/early morning snack to absorb all that alcohol that you've been drinking earlier that day.",0,0,0

We arrived in town around 7pm the weekend after my wife and I got married for an abbreviated honeymoon. I paid for a basic room with some rewards points I had from American Express but called a few days before and paid some extra cash for an upgraded suite which I was assured would be great and have a  spa with a strip view. When we go to Vegas we normally stay in a nice room so for our semi-honeymoon I didn't want that to be any different.

Check-in at the gold\/platinum\/preferred guest line had a line while the regular check-in didn't. Common sense says that the lobby staff would call people from the regular line over to assist them instead of sit there and do nothing. Apparently common sense isn't too common at this place.

So when we finally get up to our room, our upgraded suite was on the 6th floor but the only view we had was being level with the roof of the Miracle Mile mall... and the collection of tools on the roof which included a broken down wheelbarrow right outside our window. I'm definitely an adventurous guy if you know what I mean but having construction workers watch my wife and I in the spa on our honeymoon isn't exactly my idea of a good time. When I called down stairs to see exactly how they could remedy this situation they told us the windows weren't see through and they had no other rooms available. I offered to pay for an upgrade to any suite above this one but alas, no luck.

We called a few other hotels and found something available there so we hightailed it out of that place and we won't be staying there ever again.

We booked the room last minute via my Hotel Tonight iPhone application for 75 bucks out the door on New Year's Day. Considering it was NYE weekend and that the room was at a cool, vibrant hotel like Planet Hollywood, $75 was pretty darn great! 

Pros:
Earl of Sandwich
The Spice Market Buffet
Heart Bar
Miracle Mile Shops
Young and Hip Crowd
Dead center of the strip

Cons: 
Valet is sometimes only open to Diamond Rewards customers if it's a busy weekend, in which case you have to self-park and WALK with all your luggage through the Miracle Mile Shops. I guess I now know why they call it the Miracle Mile...if you can make that mile long walk through the shops, carrying all your luggage, without collapsing from exhaustion, it's literally a miracle....

But I really don't think I should cut them too much slack all things considered.  I think they would have been better off closing down the hotel for a couple months and doing a big grand opening rather than SLOWLY changing a few things at a time.

The bellhop service was kinda crappy.  We unloaded over $10k worth of DJ equipment into their care.  Told them we were going straight up to our rooms and we wanted the equipment to be right behind us.  They said  that they would have to take the service elevator, but would be right there.  30 minutes later we still don't have our stuff.  Images of our turntables and mixers being sold on the streets start running through our heads.  We had to call them and ask where our stuff was.  They showed up 5 minutes after we called and rolled their eyes at our $2 tip.  Hubby didn't want to tip them at all.

The light fixtures, carpeting and a lot of signage are all still Arabian(?) themed, but in each room they have framed stills and random stuff from movies on the walls.  Nothing in the room felt like it was ""Hollywood.""  Oh, and the boring, beige, shapeless muumuu Whoopie wore in some random movie looming over my bed... totally creepy.  There were NO LOCKS on the bathroom doors nor the door to the lil room the toilet is in.  And when you are sharing a room with a few of your husband's friends... not cool.  There wasn't a ventilation fan in the bathroom either... again, sharing rooms with hubby's friends, no good.  The automatic light in the closet was permanently stuck on on and the door kept popping open.

After one night of that, hubby and I decided to get our own room.  A couple ladies at the front desk couldn't agree on whether to let us into a new room a few hours prior to check in time even tho the room was clean and available.  But, they upgraded us to a suite for free, which is why they get an extra star.  The room was big and roomy with a nice sitting area and big bathroom.  But AGAIN no locks on the bathroom door and no ventilation fan.  The decor was still confusing.  A replica of a prop from the Thriller video isn't very exciting, whatever happened to Planet Hollywood having authentic movie memorabilia?  Same annoying closet light problem.   Oh, and the A\/C in the hallway was actually blowing REALLY hot air, not nice when it's already 116 outside.

The overall experience was too confusing.  I guess I shouldn't be too mad considering we didn't have to pay for any of it.  But for sure the next time we get booked in Vegas, we'll let the promoter know not to put us up in PH unless they've made big improvements.",0,0,0

With so many options it was difficult to chose, but we decided on Planet Hollywood based on location, price, and scenery. I believe they followed through very well.

First off, the price was right in line with what we were looking for. It wasn't anything crazy - moderate and convenient for our liking. We opted up for the Fountain View room which wasn't too much more, maybe 15-20 dollars up. I didn't know how much time I would be spending in the room itself, but the spectacular view was a nice little addition. You walk in and immediately have a view of the strip and fountains with the mountains in the backdrop. This was a b big plus for a visitor from Wisconsin. 

Now after we checked in, which keep it a grain of salt, was realistically the oddest part of the hotel. Our Lyft (or uber, I highly recommend in Vegas) dropped us off in what felt like the basement. A little jumbled and feeling a bit dirty, check in was overall pretty smooth. Very nice staff here.

+ PLUS: One of my favorite parts here was the location. I feel it is in the best spot of the strip - right next to the fountains, stores, restaurants, etc. Made getting around great. Since it does have it's own drop off in the essential underground area, it made it very simple to get in and out. The pool is also a fantastic option, I highly recommend getting a cabana although they can get pricey.

- MINUS: I read previously about how people felt the hotel was old or not updated. I feel that is a fair comment, but for the price and everything else included I'm not sure how one can complain. Our room was clean and the staff was readily available. If they were to update the hotel, such as revamping the materials in the room\/movie memorabilia and carpeting, etc., I think this would be a 5-star rating.

Overall, this is a fantastic option within the sea of hotels on the strip. If I return to Las Vegas, it would be difficult not to seriously consider this option again. Thanks, PH. You did not disappoint.

They try to jazz up the interior by putting in deep rich colored carpets and a very Hollywood and\/or nightlife-like atmosphere, but for the most part the casino looks the same and all the slots are still old. 

The rooms I would imagine to be quite nice but PH is always a must visit for me every time I come to Vegas simply because I'm a big fan of the Miracle Mile shops. I love that there are so many stores, normal stores at that, which sell normal people underpriced, on sale and great size selection items. I love that they kept the thunderstorms in the shops. Mostly though, I love the random strips of casino through the shopping so when you're tired, you can take a seat, lose some money, and keep going!

The casino is arranged in an ok fashion, they somehow have a Pink's hot dogs stand outside although I'm not sure how authentic it really is ... The buffet is the same and I still like it, but I don't think it has *as* much variety as before. Their shows are somewhat lackluster as compared to other casinos.

Positives:
- Great location basically in the middle of the Strip.
- Room was spacious even though we got the cheapest type (Hollywood Hip).
- Room was very quiet. Didn't hear any hallway noise at all.
- Loved the huge bathtub.
- Miracle Mile mall convenient.
- Big, comfortable bed.

Negatives:
- Front desk staff not engaging upon check-in and it wasn't busy.
- Bad experience with valet. They brought us the wrong car after a 10 minute wait and tried to convince us it was our car just because it was the same make. Other times had to wait 25 minutes for car.
- Was charged $1 for local calls even though this was not stated anywhere. Shouldn't cost $1 to call the hotel that I could literally see from my window (friends staying there).
- No mini fridge.

Comments:
- Self park isn't that far to walk if you're not carrying bags. Just drop your bags off with the bag desk and self park, then get bags brought up to room to avoid annoying valet.
- Drains in room were very slow and would get backed up and stand still at times (sink, bathtub).
- Movie memorabilia in our room was pretty lame.
- Lots of young, rowdy people seem to stay here. Almost every time I was in the elevator, no matter what time of day, some drunk\/high person tried to have conversations with me. If you want something quieter or more classy, I wouldn't recommend PH.

Right smack dab in the heart of the strip, across the way from the gorgeous Bellagio lake and fountain show, also connected to the miracle mile shops, a hop and skip a way from the Paris hotel and casino and right across the walking bridge from the swanky Cosmopolitan and The Aria.

They are also very pet friendly. We were greeted in our bedroom with 2 goodie bags filled with organic treats, doggy bags and bowls for both of our dogs. They also have a little dog grass area adjacent to the valet and casino entrance.

I loved the clean and large soaking tub in our room and the bed was absolutely comfortable. We spent one whole day of our vacation in bed! The Bellagio fountain view from our room was also perfect. We enjoyed over a handful of water shows day and night in our room.

We also enjoyed being able to grab super late night food right downstairs at the Earl of Sandwich or walk across the bridge over to The Cosmopolitan to grab some famous Secret Pizza.

The housekeeping staff was also very understanding about us needing an unusually large amount of towels, pillows, and a roll-away bed...

I think my favorite part about staying here was the location. It's right across the street from the city center and basically smack dab in the middle of the strip so it's not an epic walk to get anywhere. Also, Miracle Mile stores right downstairs complete with Fat Tuesday refill station. Total win.

Another win: Earl of Sandwich. 24\/7 sandwiches for my drunken pleasure? I definitely appreciate it. Props for the breakfast sandwich.",1,0,0

Everything from checking in (2 clerks on duty) to 10 minute waits for someone to answer the front desk or housekeeping phone makes you feel like Planet Hollywood has figured out exactly how little to give you, or in other words what you'll endure given that you're not paying Bellagio prices.  The valet here is poorly placed downstairs and off Las Vegas Blvd. so if you've got a car I'd suggest staying elsewhere as it's a real hassle and very slow to use the valet and if it gets full you're f&!@ed as they don't care if you're staying in the hotel or not so one night we had to park at Ballys and then go get our car the next day. In any case it's not a bad hotel given it's low room rates and good location on the strip but I recommend spending a few bucks more and staying at the Paris next door.",1,1,1

In this case, we paid for a three star experience and that's exactly what we got.

We booked our room here specifically because of their proximity to the starting line for the Las Vegas Marathon (we, in particular, ran the half) and the free bottle of liquor per stay.* And while they did not disappoint in terms of transportation to the race start, and the rooms were big, clean and decorated with deep, rich hues, nothing about our experience really stood out.

Firstly, our room was decorated with vintage movie accoutrements, which is great if the movie is Body Heat or something like that, but we had artifacts from Hellraiser. Hellraiser? Really? As if the nightmares about running 13 miles weren't bad enough, they had to include authentic nightmare inducers.

Secondly, the view we had was of the Las Vegas airport, and the back side of the strip, which wasn't terrible, particularly at night, until you take into account the giant flood light aimed directly into our room. Now, while I don't think they purposefully waited until we checked in to point it there, it's worth considering trying the $20 tip trick** to see if you have a view facing the strip instead of the back side of the hotel.

We did get plenty of coupons with our stay, including 10% off room service (which we used) and brought us not-particularly warm or tasty food, but considering how hungry we were we got it any way. The fries were noticeably limp and the burger didn't have any particular flavor. But there is something nice about people bringing things to your room.

The bathroom was big, and included a giant tub with a separate shower stall with two issues: the tub didn't really have any reason to use it (no jacuzzi jets or anything) and the shower didn't get enough water pressure or get hot enough to really make it great. Granted, we didn't pay for water pressure, but I think I was under the impression you didn't have to.

Basically what I learned is that in Vegas, moreso than just about anywhere else, you get what you pay for and if you pay for a three-star experience, that's exactly what you'll get.***

* - We had originally read it to say that you received a free bottle of liquor PER NIGHT per stay, but they declined us that offer. It's entirely possible it was the race promoter's fault, and really we probably could not have imbibed that much, but I'd still go to my grave of the opinion they said we could have a bottle per night.

** - I was told by a friend of mine that when the front desk asks for your ID and credit card upon checking that you should tuck a $20 bill in there and ask if they have any upgrades available. While we didn't do that, friends at the Bellagio did and said it got them a lake-front view.

*** - It will also get you one of the best all-time Vegas stories, but I'm not sharing that here.",3,3,4

It was a very busy weekend and the valet was completely full when we got there at 1:00am. Which was fine except having to walk to the complete other side of the miracle mile mall. The line to check in was a little lengthy (about 30 min). After we checked in we found our room to be very nice very comfortable beds. My kids loved the huge bath tub and the view. We stayed in the lost in space themed room on the 37th floor. Our room was very quiet and we were in the first room once you walked off the elevator and never heard any noise. The pool was very basic, but the good thing is guests of planet Hollywood are aloud to use the pool at Paris or the flamingo. We used the Pool at the flamingo and it was awesome.

The hotel checkin was not staffed and complaining was the only way to get more employees to help check in.  There were 23 people waiting mid afternoon with no one at the counter.  The hotel is definitely an after thought for this property.  The service is equal to a motel 6 and the access to hotel rooms and facilities is poorly marked.  The mall seems to be the primary ficus with casino next snd hotel guests last.  Staff seem disorganized and bothered if approached. Plus the appearance of the property is substandard with carpet tore elevator doors dirty scratched and damaged.

I LOVE the location of PH - such a perfect spot on the strip. We upgraded our room to a view of the Bellagio fountains, and that was really nice. We had a great view of the fountains and the Paris hotel and other areas of the strip from the 18th floor. I really do wish the window was bigger, though. It was basically just a window in the corner of the room, with a table, mirror and chair in front. We moved what we could for our stay in order to get the most out of the view. 

I found my room to be very dusty and the armoire was very scratched up, which was a bit of an eye sore. The king bed was SO comfortable, though. My partner and I joked around about ""sleeping on a cloud."" 

Our bathroom had a standing shower, a separate soaker tub, huge bathroom counter (which I appreciated) and the toilet was behind its own door in the bathroom. The light above the toilet would only turn on 70% of the time (bulb was dying). 

The casino is a decent size, but it is very confusing getting around as there are so many restaurants and so many entrances to the mall (not necessarily a bad thing). The parking garage, while free, was a bit of a hike from the actual hotel, had to walk about 7 minutes through the mall to get to the garage. I did like that the garage entrance was not directly on the strip so it was not so intimidating to get in and out of, as the traffic on the strip gets so crazy. 

Elevators were very fast and convenient. 

Multiple restaurants and 2 Starbucks locations inside the hotel and casino. Miracle Mile shops were nice, too. 

Casino staff (supervisors and dealers) were extremely kind. I felt comfortable and happy as it was my first time gambling at a table.

This is one of the best locations on the strip for those on a budget. There are tons of $-$$ restaurants within a short walking distance and in the hotel itself. We got a pretty sweet deal directly from the hotel's site. Highly recommend looking for coupon codes and checking out their promotional offers.

Didn't have any problems with getting extra towels or amenities and the beds were comfortable. Not the biggest rooms but still enough space to play some rage cage and beer pong. (Purely for perspective...ehem...)

I scouted for $5 blackjack tables but to no avail so I parked myself at the no-bust blackjack table and lost $75 WAY too fast...(sad face exit)

But really tho, the all-encompassing convenience of PH is hard to beat. Like the fact that...

- PBR (Professional Bull Riding) is downstairs and open late so you can ghost ride the bull and crawl back to your room. No cabs. No bullshit. No problem.
- Earl's is downstairs and they're open late. Long lines but efficient process.

After checking in at the diamond lounge we went to our room but our keys wouldn't work. While I tried and tried my keys the phone in the room was ringing but without access to my room I couldn't get to the phone. 

I went down to see about new key cards and the diamond room was now closed so i waited in line and got a second set of keys.  There was no apology for the key issue from the front desk just told ""here ya go"". 

My keys did work and I found my room to be very clean and renovated as stated. I had a message on the machine from the earlier call only to find it was the front desk checking to see if all was ok with the room. I suppose all might be ok except for the fact I couldn't access it to answer the call to see how things were. Perhaps if you called my cell u could have heard from me live and brought me new keys rather than me having to go down for them. 

Overall room was great. The only complaint is that the lighting in the bathroom is strange. Where the vanity is its way too dark. My wife would have to go to the main room near the window to put makeup on. The toilet area was too bright. Seriously it seemed like a surgical room. 

We ordered room service and the food came quickly and tasted great. 

The casino was not so hot. Music was often too loud.  The players seemed to be a younger crowd that were loud and often rude. The slot choices are horrible.

Front Desk 1 of 5 stars
Expect a 30-45 min wait to check in. We were happy to arrive and have a fun night on the town but the staff at the hotel were not happy to have to deal with customers. Don't expect them to smile, give any suggestions, or explain the crazy holds they will put against your account when you go to check out. We were charged a deposit when we reserved the room, when we checked in and then twice more throughout our one night stay! Our bill was 190 yet they put holds on the account for 570!   Not the end of the world but unexpected. Something we should have been made aware of when we checked it.

Room 2 of 5
Not the cleanest or nicest room on the strip. For same price range you can stay at NYNY, MGM or Mandalay Bay and have a much nicer room. The bathroom isn't as clean as you'd expect. A lot of grunge build up. Also we were in a non smoking room but the room had a unpleasant smell.  We paid for a strip view upgrade to be able to see fountains of bellagio. Not worth it. The windows are very small. Unlike every other hotel on the strip with nice large windows to enjoy the view.

Room Service 2 of 5
Ordered breakfast at 7am. It arrived quickly with the first smiling staff member of our entire stay. But food was cold and tasteless. How do you fail to make a decent waffle, eggs or ham? Also I don't recommend the coffee. Also cold.

Casino 1 of 5
We didn't get to venture much of the casino floor because we were hounded so badly by promoters to go the club upstairs. Literally every turn was another promoter. We ended up going to our room early and calling it a night. They wouldn't take no for answer even though they wanted to charge $50 for two people to enter on a Tuesday night with no special guest DJ. Same price to get into the good clubs on the strip. And considering it was only 10pm we should have had free entry! All the big clubs do that just for showing up early and getting the place full. We are not cheap. However, this is about perceived value. You want us to pay $50 and be the first to enter your club on a dead night? No. 

Overall rating a 2 of 5.  I bumped up stars from 1 to 2 because of the mall being so close and the Streakhouse inside hotel is fantastic (which was rated a 5 of 5 by me on its own Yelp page)

Check in maybe? We booked our two bed hollywood hip via their website about a month in advance. We upgraded and paid $100 extra for a view of the Bellagio Fountains. We get there and out of ALL their rooms, they only had rooms with one bed left. The guy at the desk offered a $10 discount on one night (we were staying 3). Since it was late and we didn't want to deal with it we went up to the room only to realize that the $100 view was actually of a roof of another building with no fountains in site. Back downstairs we went where there was a very mad fellow yelling because his room key didn't work (that happened to me as well on the second day). This time front desk guy hooked us up with a bigger nicer room, huge bathroom, flat screen above the soaking tub with a decent view of the strip and flat screen in the bedroom. The layout of everything was super confusing as well. I got lost several times. That could be because I am geographically challanged, but I didn't have as hard of time managing my way through other casinos.

The pool area was ok. Not that big, the bar isn't super close to the pool and the pool istelf is small. I would also say it is a meat market. The music was super loud and it was hard to carry on a conversation. 

The Miracle Mile Mall was nothing special either. 

My parents stayed at the towers and I think I would much rather go there. The pool area was really nice, the bar was close and the music wasn't so obnoxious and loud. The rooms were really nice as well.

I was disappointed in the ""resort"". First the parking is truly a 15 minute walk. and if you rie a motorcycle it is not like you can use valet parking, and you will walk quite a distance with your bags. Before I booked a room there I specifically asked about parking for my bike and was told there will be plenty of parking but when I got there I had to maneuver an 800 lb motorcycle thru bicycles and scooters that were parked every which way. 
After my hike to the reservation desk the cashier informed me I cold not opt out to pay cash at the end of my stay. my CC would have the amount placed on ""hold"" and in essence holds the amount of money basically at ransome. I have been at other hotels that did not have to do that and were glad to have my CC info but did not hold funds on my CC. 
We found our way to the elevators and found Brittney Spears plastered everywhere! The decor felt dated and there was not the clean feeling one would expect. 
When I opened the door the room reeked of cigarette smoke! Then I found an ashtray so I called the front desk. Turns out that the cashiers just put us in a smoking room with gout ever asking if we smoke! And he figured we would want to stay in the room for four days....didn't ask us if we smoked?  Well I guess that was MY fault since I had on a motorcycle jacket he profiled all bikers as smokers. They should ask each person if they would like a smoking or non smoking room. 
So now the room doesn't really feel clean. The room was sufficient and the decor was 90's. The bathroom was large and had a large soaking tub and separate shower and so that was nice!
My first morning there I placed the hotel ""Do not disturb sign"" in place. They came in anyways. The next night I wanted the room clean...they did not come clean the room and then I found a weird matt stain on the bathroom floor. So do they wash the marble floors between guests?
Down in the mezzanine I had a drink with my lunch and the glass was cracked! apx 3 inches of it. I think they were so fast to set the tables they didnt care\/notice such a large crack. 
So lets try the Miracle mile mall.....all very nice. Things of all price points BUT be careful three of the stores there ring up the price by rounding UP! Yes Ocean one charged our friend $48 for a bill that was first shown as 47.24 but the waiter rang it and rounded up. When this was brought to his attention he said they always do that. Its just the way it is done. After my friend made a fuss the waiter all of 20 something...took the bill back. dug in his apron pocket and gave my friend the difference...Do you think THAT problem will ever be resolved? NO so YOU will be the next over charged person!
Next stop Popcorn...same thing! one price listed for pop corn but then the over charge and dont have an answer as to why. Ver nice to us but didnt change the price until after the manager was called in....seems that is STANDARD practice there!
In the end when I checked out and when I was asked if my stay was ok I told them all that happened...right down to the bathroom floor not being washed. The young girl said she was sorry but my bill was never adjusted. I told her I will never stay there again. You pay a price and have a certain expectation and it just isn't met, period.

-Dingy, dark rooms
-Torn towels at the pool (some might consider the towels shredded) 
-Questionable smudges all over the mirrors
-Bed linens that should be white but can only be considered off-white
-Missing pillows
-Bathmats that are taken and not replaced
-Leaky faucets with water stains all over the counter
-Hair that definitely isn't yours left in the shower

This hotel was disgusting with a capital D. I ended up here because the conference hotel I was supposed to stay at (nearby) ran out of the conference room rate. Big mistake. HUGE. And to add insult to injury, I managed to get the stomach flu and got stuck in the dump for 2 days straight. There is no excuse for a hotel that charges these rates to be this dingy. NO EXCUSE. I don't expect 5-star service or crazy amenities when I travel. I just expect cleanliness. 

If I could give this place zero stars, I would. 

Do yourself a favor and find a room elsewhere.",12,6,4

TOO DARK and TV located NOT in front of bed, which sucked. GREAT view of Eiffel Tower. Comfy bed, and very quiet too. The maid who cleaned up on August 15 (the day we checked in) did an awful job!!! Found an open condom wrapper behind the trash can, and under the beds had a bunch of trash!!!

Toilet pressure way too low, 2 flushes MINIMUM to rid of what you did. LOL

Shower pressure too low, if you have long hair, good luck getting shampoo out. 

NO coffee maker, NO mini fridge.

Vending machine does not give out change on this floor 19th, north tower.

Looking for the valet parking is a nightmare!!!

Pool, well, lets just say, weird. First off, you have to walk through a dak 6th floor hall to get to the pool area. Then you walk out, and, wait, where is the pool??? After walking through a sea of chairs, the pool is up to the left. Really bad design. The ""adult pool"" was on the other side, but it was closed. There is a pool wayyyy over at the ""Westgate"" area, and I would recommend this over the 6th floor pool. You cold rent misting chairs, but I did not find out how much. The bar staff was really nice over at this pool.

Casino was fun, good music, Planet Dailies, Pinks, and that sandwich 
shop were good. The buffet was OK, had better. 

TIPS: BRING an ice chest! BRING a coffee maker. There is a Starbucks, but wants to wait in line for 20 minutes in the morning when you are hungover If you want to watch TV in bed, ask for a room where you 
can see the TV. Slip the checkin person $20 for a free upgrade.

+ A clean room; the non-smoking room wasn't smoky, the bathroom was clean, the floor felt clean on my feet, the bed was comfy and clean.

+ Great location, especially now being so close to City Center.  Easy access to the Strip from your room, easy access to the casino, restaurants in the Planet Hollywood, and so close to Bellagio, Paris, etc.

+ The casino is always popular and fun-- current top 40 music, great atmosphere, and clean as well.

+Self parking-- I just like that I can go to my car on my own, if I forget something in my car, I don't have to wait for valet or anything like that.  It's a little ways of a walk through the mall, but not horrible.

+ Shopping mall inside the hotel\/casino-- I just love shopping!  And there are stores there that normal working class folk can afford!  I could walk into a number of their stores like I would any other mall and buy a whole outfit-- not a coin purse for $150.  That makes vacation shopping fun, right?

+ We got a free bottle of champagne with our hotel room with an online promo they had going on at the time-- when is free alcohol not a good thing?

What I wasn't exactly a fan of:
The longer walk to get to the self parking lot-- maybe I was carrying too much... It was longer than I would have liked, but do-able.
Textured flooring in parts of the mall-- not fun in heels, take a pair of flip flops along with you for your purse if you can manage.",0,0,2

The bathroom is in much need of an upgrade!!!  I wanted to shower with slippers on!  There was calcium build up on the shower head.  Terrible water pressure.  Build up around the sink handles.

Bell Service- 5 Stars upon arrival!! 1 Star when we departed!

Casino- 3 Stars.  Seemed like all the same machines.  Not much variety.  No wonder it was fairly empty.

Cocktail Hostess- 0 Stars if possible.  She took our drink order and vanished into thin air!!  Must've been David Copperfield!

Restaurants- 3 Stars for Pin Up Pizza.  Great prices and decent pizza.  My daughter rated BurGR 3 Stars.  The food was tasty but the service was lacking.

We were happy with the room except that the bathroom doesn't have a fan. Also the safe didn't work even after requesting a fix (we have no idea if it was broken or what, they didn't leave a message or offer an alternative).  Also the tv controls were funky-- couldn't use the remote to turn it on..and the volume went to full blast and it reset to some channel each time it got turned on. So immediately had to hit the volume down button, which then went completely to zero. Ok, so turn it up now. LoL No channel guide, so flip through at least a half dozen casino channels before you can find a real tv station. Oh and the sleep timer button doesn't work. We stayed in cheaper places with much better TVs than this. Geez!

We didn't get much info when checking in, which is bad service. The clerk scribbled ""north"" next to my room number which I didn't notice until after proceeding to the South Elevator. Then we had to search for the North ones, which are harder to find (especially on the casino level). We could see a pool from our room but never saw a soul, so we assumed it was closed?? We also would have liked to know that we could get restaurant discounts with the Total Rewards card. Usually those cards are hotel specific for points, and not worth signing up for since I'm not a frequent visitor. But we could have saved money dining there for 3 days. Didn't realize that until the end of day 2, kind of too late. 

The self park was hard to find and a loooooong walk through the Mile Shops. We were glad to be staying near a mall though. We didn't have to drive anywhere if we needed something, Walgreens came in very handy. 

All in all, we don't regret staying here. The view was worth it and was #1 on our list of priorities. But we think we could have had an overall better experience across the street at the Cosmo.",0,0,0

I always find it amazing how American companies find a way to make you pay for everything, room with a view? That's extra ($20 per night PLUS tax). Bigger room? Extra. Fast pass to skip the que, extra... Where will the madness end! :O

Anywhoo, we paid for the view & were glad we did since it was our first time in Vegas, but talk about disappointing. We had a tiny window & could see from the edge of the bellagio (not the fountains either) right up to the end of the strip, it was amazing. Though a balcony or a bigger window would have been better appreciated. The rooms themselves were lovely, very comfortable bed (although we didn't do much sleeping), good sized wardrobe & TV & the bathroom was magnificant with a giant power shower & big bath tub & separate cubicle for the toilet...

The pool area was great, although I only just saw it, never spent any actual time there... Just too busy seeing the rest of Vegas!

The real winner for this hotel in my opinion is it's location. The hotel is literally smack bang in the middle of the strip and attached to one of the better shopping malls I had seen in hotels (the one in Ceasers is bigger, but too big for me. I spend 90 minutes on the second floor of their shopping mall without even going into a shop because I couldn't find my way back out!). There was also all the different food options right on the hotel grounds (PF Changs, Pinks, Pin-up pizza, and lots lots more in the mall). If you do visit planet Hollywood go try The Spice Market Buffet. Oh my GOD, breakfasts here were to die for, but if you manage to get there at bruch ask for a mimosa to go with it... Delish. (p.s. if you go to a buffet for breakfast ask for the 24 hour pass, only about $10 more & opens 7 different buffets for you for the day all included).

The hotel suited the kind of holiday we were on perfectly. We were a gang of messy, happy drunks who just wanted a good time & the PH staff were fantastic at putting up with us & getting in on the banter. We didn't get the same impression from staff at other hotels.

Why am I docking a star? What would I change? The theme to be honest! Although I understand the theme is ""Planet Hollywood"" & this theme was executed perfectly with the glamourous go-go dancers & beautiful dealers in corsets & hotpants and the movie memorabelia in each bedroom, having been to see the other hotels I was left feeling a little bit like I had missed out. Every other hotel has a sense of grandure that I didn't quite get from PH. Again, as I said, their theme was perfectly executed & a big extravogant casino like the others would not have fit in with Planet Hollywood and as I also said, this suited us for the type of holiday we were on.

If I was to visit Vegas again with a group, this would be the hotel for me. If it was just myself & my Fiancé it would probably be somewhere different to give us the fancy experience.",6,0,1

I have to say, I was a complete nay-sayer for Planet Hollywood taking over the Aladdin.  I sort of liked the Aladdin, and have NEVER liked any Planet Hollywood restaurant.  To me they're glorified Applebees, and I couldn't imagine the train wreck they would unleash on the former Aladdin space.

Hey, I can admit when I'm wrong.  This is one of those times.

The casino is slick and hip, done in black, red, and metallics.  It's totally different than most casinos with their crazy carpet and millions of colors (I'm looking at you, Bellagio...you too, Wynn).  PH's casino is almost understated - even the tables look sleek with their black felt tops.

As for the rest of the hotel, I did stay here when it was the Aladdin and really liked our room - it was enormous for the price, and had a large bathroom to match.  I also enjoyed the pool, but can't comment on how that's changed.  The shopping has remained pretty much the same since the switch, although now it's called the Miracle Mile instead of Dessert Passage.  It's still not as great as the Forum Shops...Miracle Mile has typical stores that can be found in any mall in America.",4,1,0

My husband and I got married in the chapel there. Great chapel, really helpful wedding assistant, but the wedding manager was kind of a butt (I don't know if she still works there) - another story for another time. 

The lobby is really fun. There are huge Swarovski chandeliers hanging on both sides of the escalators leading to the casino. And there is a scent in the lobby that is amazing! Everyone that works there denies that they're pumping a scent into the air, but they are, and it always makes me so relaxed. 

Check-in can be hectic and loud if you get there at regular check-in time - I recommend getting there early or really late to avoid waiting in line for 30+ minutes.  On our 2nd stay there, we had booked a regular room, lowest rate, and when we got to check in the clerk said that they didn't have any more of those rooms and we would need to purchase an upgrade in order to get a non-smoking king room. We asked if there was nothing else available and the clerk did some more clicking on her keyboard and came up with a non-smoking king room with a shower only.  We stay there for the huge soaking tub, so we decided to go ahead and purchase the upgrade so that we could get the room we wanted. Supposedly we got the LAST non-smoking king room. They gave us a room right by the elevator and we didn't sleep a wink all night. The next morning my husband called down to the front desk and asked if they had anything else available - they did, and thankfully they were able to switch us.....to a non-smoking king room down the hall from our elevator room....this was at 8am so they had this room open all night. I was happy to be moving but unhappy that they didn't give us that room in the first place since it was open. 

My husband and I have stayed in a regular updated room, a strip view suite that had not been updated (huge bathtub, but it was right above the pool level so people at the pool bar could see us...they waved back when we waved to see if they could see in our windows. plus, we couldn't see the strip at all), and a penthouse level suite (comped for our wedding since the suite we booked was not available due to renovations). All of the rooms are comfortable with lots of space, but the regular rooms only have wardrobes, no actual closets. 

Lots of food options, with Earl of Sandwich being the best value in the entire hotel! The buffet is really good! They have a mall connected to the hotel that has an ABC sundries shop if you need any medicine or toiletries. My husband and I got to watch an episode of CSI being taped there, and met all of the guest stars (it was the episode where they switched out their writers for the writers of two and a half men).

I just stayed 2 nights at Planet Hollywood in early June 2013. We stayed in one of the Hollywood Hip room. The room is very spacious. It was very tidy and clean also.

As for the bathroom, there's a tub in the middle of it. The only thing I don't like about the bathroom is the fact that they use water saving shower head. I want my water to be on full blast. And beside there's a tub in the bathroom that consumes more water than the shower itself. 

Another thing I didn't like about this hotel is that you have to walk really far from the parking garage to the lobby. You have to walk half the length of the mall to get one of those elevators to go up to your room.

As is true for most things in Vegas, however, it has not worn well.  For example, the Roman shade in our room was jerry-rigged open with a hanger from one of the closets.  Classy.  All that said, the price was fair, the location was decent.  They just opened Gordon Ramsey's BURGR restaurant, which was pretty good; very generous dinner for two with appetizers, entrees, sides and dessert for $60.

Expect a younger crowd, and if you're even remotely serious about your gambling, expect that younger crowd to be an utter disappointment at the tables.  They can screw up a game of blackjack without even blinking, and then wonder why the rest of the table is giving them the stinkeye.",2,2,0

First of all, LOCATION. Smack dab in the middle of the Strip, you can pretty much walk anywhere. If you're not planning on driving in Las Vegas your best bet is to stay here. 
Second, it's AFFORDABLE. Ranging around $40 - $70 on weekdays and $150 - $200 on weekends (depending on the season, of course), it's one of the cheaper-yet-still-nice hotels.
Third, the stores and restaurants inside are affordable. The Miracle Mile is just like a normal mall with shops such as Sephora, Gap, H&M, Victoria's Secret etc. Idk about you but I'm not rollin on a big budget. I'd much rather have shops I can actually shop in, than shops I can walk by and say, Wow what a nice $5000 purse. 
Fourth, awesome front desk people. They really try to work with you on special requests such as having rooms next to each other, or having a specific view. Last summer I tried the $20 sandwich trick here for the first time - I booked the cheapest standard room and got upgraded to resort room with a great view of 'Eiffel' Tower. 
Fifth, EARL OF SANDWICH. This is probably my favorite place to eat in the whole world. I love it so much, if PH didn't have any other dining options I'd probably still rate it a 5 star just for the fact that they have Earl's. 
The only downside I can think of is that they don't have a club on site, but personally this is not even a factor for me since I don't go clubbing. Also, parking is pretty far from the rooms but then again once you've walked it once or twice it doesn't feel that far anymore. 
I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.",3,1,0

I booked through Expedia and got a solid deal on a 2 queen size bed newly renovated room for 2 nights. Check in is at 4pm and check out is at 11pm and if you want to check in early it's an additional minimum of  $20 charge (like most hotels on the strip) but, you can drop your bags off and have them hold it for you so you can go out exploring until 4pm and make sure you don't lose your ticket because once you get your room you call the number on the bottom of the ticket and the bell boy will bring your luggage right up to your room.

When we checked in the guy who checked me in was speedy and fast and failed to mention some crucial information that made me end up being charged more when it came down for me to check out 3 days later. He failed to mention how much the resort fee per night was ($40\/night that pays for WiFi, Gym, and calls from the hotel phone) and how many devices are allowed to be on the wifi (which was major). he ran though on how to connect to the Wifi very quickly, everything was already prepaid, and told us where the elevator was to get to our room and that was it. You're only allowed to have 2 devices connected to Planet Hollywood's wifi any more and you will be charged $15 for each device that is connected after the two (which we didn't know, maybe it was on the card holder and i didn't read it, maybe not). and when it was time to check out I was slapped with an extra $110 bill (basically another nights stay)

The room was clean and we didn't spend the extra $50 for a nice view. You have a tub, shower, a separate toilet with it's own lock and a refrigerator, nothing too fancy. The beds were really comfortable but roominess was a bit tight if you have more than 5 people hanging out. The pool area is nice with two bars and two large pools. One pool to the left is more of a party area with DJ's and everything while the other is more of a family friendly area, I guess. I'd probably wouldn't stay here again though as i feel you can get better bang for the buck at other hotels on the strip. 

My favorite spot to go while in the Planet Hollywood side of the strip is Earls Sandwiches that always hits the spot when you're super drunk and need a little munchie meal before you pass out. Also, near the ABC store (which is always great) there's a bar (next to the entrance) and they have beer pong tables you can rent out and play with your friends. If you're a first timer or into large slushy drink then you have to stop by this Fat Tuesday.",3,1,3

It was reasonably priced although I wish the rooms were a little more updated. The beds are comfy and the bathroom is a nice size, we had Shirley temple theme room since every room is different stars. We rented a Cabana by the 21+ pool and that was nice but the waiter staff can be a little more attentive. The restaurants at this hotel are great  we ate at Gorden Ramsey BGR place. My favorite part of my stay was having frozen drinks at ""FAT TUESDAY"" defff worth going there its near the miracle mile shops. i will stay again for the right price!

If you want to Self Park, you must park on the north end of the shops and walk a good 10-15 min. through the shops with your baggage, past Elara, then through the mazed ridden hotel, down elevators, etc.... to get to front desk. When we got there at 4:50 PM, our Resort room was not going to be ready until 6 PM. What a crock for a Friday when you are trying to get ready for dinner and check in is at 3 PM. The guy at the desk was rude and I had to ask him what the final cost was, after he already ran my card, then ask for my receipt, then ask where I could place my bags until the room was ready. Very unprofessional gentleman. 
After we got to the room, the hallway was smoky, which seeped into our non-smoking room.That was the worst during our stay there. You expect to not smell smoke in your room, but it was always lingering. The Resort room was nice and large for us 4 girls. Beds were comfy. And the hotel is conveniently located on the strip. Going to the North Tower rooms, we always got lost finding it though. The lack of signs pointing you in the right direction was a pain. 
The pool has a weird set up. It's on the 6th floor and when you walk out its all white concrete with surrounding rows of chairs. We first thought, great, there's plenty of seating! Then, ""where's the pool??"" Both the east and west end have a small pool, one that has a platform into it for Sat. bikini contest. All the cabanas surrounding the pool were occupied, but no chairs. So you can't lay by the pool, you have to walk down the stairs and lay out with the boring concrete. No site to see whatsoever. BORING. And you have a DJ at both pools and one in the middle, so laying out you hear a mix of music which can get annoying. But no kids were there that I saw. Only grown men that feel it's appropriate to play with beach balls and do cannon balls into the pool, splashing you and getting water into your drinks. 
The all you can eat buffet downstairs is amazing though! And Earl's is pretty good too. When searching for a hotel for this weekend, Venetian was running the same $, if not less expensive price for their Bella Suite, which is 200 sq. ft. larger than the Resort room at PH. We all agreed we'd never stay at PH again and should have stayed there. Elara was really nice when I stayed in their 2 bdrm suite a few years ago and from what I hear, that used to be PH's.",0,0,0

But I've just never had such poor service from a hotel before, much less one that accommodates over 2,000 people. First night I got here I asked for some toiletries and unlike other hotels that would usually just provide them for you, the desk receptionist told me I can purchase them at the gift shop. Purchase, really? What a joke. Then I find out via a slip in my bathroom that they were going to shut down the water for a couple of hours, a mild inconvenience but whatever. I come back at 6 to find the water all yellow and brown and no hot water. I've spent a day walking around at CES and I can't even take a shower. This is seriously just too much.

Bad: Parking hell in the back end of the shops and valet from hell, weird entrance on the side, asian pit boss ladies.

I have to be honest, I have never really like this place since PH took over Aladdin - but the improvement to the pavement inside is a little bit easier for the strollers. 

Anyhoo - was here for a wedding - was here the day before to scout the place out. Had to Bataan death march all over the place, but did had the chance to grab a bite at Earls. The next day - I just use valet since it's a lot closer to the chapel on the 3rd floor. After the world's most streamlined wedding - we waited longer on getting our car from the valet than the whole goddamn wedding.

I have a say it's a pretty big fail on their end on a crappy layout for general parking and a retarded valet crew.",1,0,1

Although the rooms seem upgraded, the cleanliness and overall up keep was terrible. We were there for 2 nights and had to switch rooms 3 times. Last thing you want to do is wake up in the morning and not be able to shower because the drainage system doesn't work and your ankle deep in sudsy water and grim. They told us we had to wait to switch room until the evening. After insisting with them to switch rooms immediately they did only to find out our next room was filthy. Hair and grim on the bath tub, shower and toilet bowl, food crumbs in pillow cases and dust bunnies everywhere. In addition the sinks didn't drain properly again. So ended up switching to another room late afternoon, wasn't clean again but we were fed up. They offered to waive a $40 resort fee but when check out came there was no manager and the agent didn't honor the $40 resort fee waive. Honestly it wasn't worth it, a cheaper hotel on the strip was not worth the hassle we went through for a clean room. Id rather spend the extra $$ and go back to Bellagio, Venetian or any of the newer ones.When I tried to complain at checkout they told me all the managers were busy and that I could call in and a manager would try and do something for me.  When I called the next day, the manager Roberto said that there is nothing he can do.  Really? I'm sure if he stayed in his own hotel and had to switch 3 separate rooms they would have comped him or even made his stay more enjoyable.  This hotel is the worse one I've ever been to on the strip and the way they treat their guests is terrible.  Never go to this hotel.  It's not worth it.",2,2,2

It was my first time in Vegas (minus being 12 with my parents at Circus Circus) & PH was PERFECT for the younger crowd. Our room was a resort vista and it was beautiful and clean. We had a problem with the toilet, but called someone and they came to fix it right away. The drain also took a long time for the water to go down in the shower. And the TV in the bathroom didn't work. The pool area was huge but the pool itself was pretty small.

The biggest problem with this place is the maze you have to go through (Miracle Mile mall) to get to the lobby to check in & out. There's an easier way if you walk outside, I discovered on my last day, but with 100 degree weather, maybe inside an air conditioned building isn't so bad.

But besides that, the bed was comfortable. The temperature of the room was perfect. Awesome location right in the middle of the strip. Cheap price for the stay. Friendly\/helpful staff. I would come back to Vegas and stay here again. Thanks PH!",0,0,0

But, the rooms are a bit run down. In our room, one of the doors was broken off the entertainment center.  It's just not that nice.
I used the gym and spa. 
The steam room was full of mold. I walked in and looked at the tile and there was black grime in between all of the tiles. It also had a moldy smell when you breathed the air. 

Use the dry sauna instead.

In the spa, there is no water. Other spas have plenty of ice cold water all around but PH's spa? Nada. I asked if they had water and the attendant went and got me two bottles from the frig in the nail salon. I guess they don't want to give out water. In the gym, instead of giving out water bottles (these are the little 8 oz bottles), they give cups of water to fill from a cooler. Try drinking water from a cup while running on a treadmill or on the elliptical.

Anyway, the place is ok and it is convenient. But there are far nicer hotels with clean spas that are not stingy with the water.",0,0,0

This review is based upon a 3 day stay in January 2013 and a 4 day stay in April 2013. I play enough that my rooms are always comped, but figure their prices are in line with similar hotels. They used to boast that they did not have a ""resort fee"" and thus one would save money staying there. However they recently instituted a daily resort fee as well of $20 per day which includes internet access.  In April we had two different rooms. In one, the furniture was so beat up you'd think it was still there because the Goodwill store turned down the furniture as a donation because it wasn't worth picking up. So why do I give it 3 stars?

Pros:
1. It's location on the strip is phenomenal.  It's only a ""Vegas"" short walk to Caesars, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, Aria, Paris, Bally's, Flamingo, MGM, NYNY & Monte Carlo. If you need anything, 24 hour Walgreens is right next door. 
2. Casino - It's my favorite, most fun place to play blackjack. The Pleasure Pit with good looking women dealers in lingerie is a blast. The dealers are Fun. Pit bosses Jerrod and Christina are a blast too. The music is great. It just rocks!  Also very high ceilings in casino great for smoke and sense of spaciousness.
3. I'm too old for the club, but my understanding it's happening.
4. Restaurants - Pro ones are Burgr and PF Changs. Planet Dailies is a decent 24 hr. coffee shop restaurant and Starbucks is always open too.
5. Room Locations - The hotel elevators are designed so you don't have a long walk to your room regardless where it is. And the tower is convenient to casino and restaurants. Unlike other hotels where you walk half a mile within the hotel just to get to your room or other part.
6. Room Baths - Most have great, large baths. Large soaking tub and separate  large shower. Toilet closet with door. Might only have one sink, but very long vanity top is great to have.

Cons:
1. Rooms were redone when hotel changed from Aladdin to PH. They now look tired. Same goes for hallway carpet. The room we had with the beat up furniture the safe was so low it was literally 2 inches off the floor. Had to get on knees to use it.
2. Spice Market Buffet - Used to be good. Now not so much. I go elsewhere if I want buffet, even if I'm staying at PH.

Hopefully they will refurbish rooms soon. Then it will be a solid 3+ stars. If they don't, it will be hard not to drop the rating.",1,0,0

Stayed for three nights sat-tues. 

cons
When we arrived (before 5 on sat) the valet was full and we had to go find a spot in the mall parking lot. When I asked the manager at the front desk why they didn't reserve valet spots for guests he said if the self park was good enough for him it was good enough for me. 
We tried to order room service one morning and waited on hold for easily five minutes before we just gave up and went downstairs. 
We tried to book a massage at the spa and again couldn't even get someone to answer the phone. Ended up getting massages at Paris next door, which turns out to be run by the same company. 
Pool is very poorly designed. Two pools are elevated ten feet off the ground with a football field of concrete between them. 90% of the seating is in this area where you cannot even see the water. 

Pros
Room was large and clean with a huge bathroom. Good view of the strip however the window was so filthy on the outside it detracted a bit. 
Great music at the pool and the water was chilled to the perfect temp for august in vegas.

I'm the Maid of Honor for my best friend, we stayed here for her bachelorette party June 27-29. It was six of us girls. 

First, we got there at 11:40 pm Friday night due to THE WORST traffic ever. It took us 8 hours to get to Vegas from LA. 

We're already in a bad mood and when we check in they said they gave away our room since we got there so late so they put us in a room with one king bed and said we could switch rooms on Saturday ..............

One king bed for six girls and they expected us to pack up all our stuff from getting ready in 30 minutes so we could go out Friday night and attempt to switch rooms after the day club the next day? Okay..

I had bought so many decorations and I couldn't use them because I thought we were going to switch room and we ended up not switching rooms because we were so busy so the decorations were a waste of money.

We had asked for a roller bed when we checked in at 11:40 pm and when we got back to our hotel at 5 am it still wasn't there. I was exhausted and called for the roller bed and it didn't get there until 6 am when they said they'd take it up to the room while we were out. 

Saturday afternoon we get back from the day club and we run out of towels. We call housekeeping for towels and after telling us it'd be ten minutes it turned out to be an hour and fifteen minutes. 

Since we didn't have our original room with two queen beds and a roller bed I ended up sleeping with a friend on one roller bed and 4 girls in the King Bed.

After telling the manager that I was just looking a for a room, nothing special just a room, she mysteriously was able to find a room available.  I also overheard the clerk and the manager talking, he said to the manager that they didn't want to give me that room because the room was booked for the day that I was checking out.  After getting the room availability situated, I was now informed that my room was going to cost me more than when I was quoted when I booked the room.  That was a big run around for them to finally find the notes proving my price quote.  After getting everything taken care of in the lobby, the clerk offer some free drinks to be sent up to my room for all the confusion.  He told me that the drinks will be sent up right away.  I made it up to my room and was waiting for room service for my complimentary drinks.  Half hour went by still waiting for my complimentary drinks.  At the 45 minute mark I called down to the desk to see the status of my complimentary drinks.  The clerk who had promised the drinks said that he didn't send over the order to room service but will get right on it and call me back with a time.  I waited another 20 minutes and did not get a call back.  I called him once again and he said it would be another 45 minutes.  We decided not to wait around anymore and went back out to experience Vegas.  After about 3 hours out of the room, I went back and saw that room service was just dropping off my complimentary drinks.  Now to the shower.  The water in the shower seemed to only get warm enough to be able to take a shower.  The drain was draining awfully slow.  I was sure that the shower was going to overflow.  The toilet in the room would only flush on occasion.  The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling everywhere.  After letting someone know there, they apparently didn't see any concern to remedy the problem.  While getting ready one of the days I wanted to catch some of the Cubs game.  Couldn't get the remote to turn the TV on.  Had to manually turn the tv on.  The remote would change the channels no problem but 1 was only able to watch 1 channel.  All the other channels said I didn't have access to.  During checkout I again made them aware of all the problems and the runaround that I was given.  All the managers and clerks could do for me was say they can have a person call me about my experience.  I will definitely not stay here again.  I am debating on avoiding all of Caesars properties.",0,0,0

I am a Total Rewards member as well as a MLife member. Wanted to try a different hotel and was very disappointed. 1-Given room 2180, opened door to a smokey room with ashes on almost all flat surfaces (marked as a non-smoking room), I was told by the person on the phone that they would send someone up to spray the room but all suites are ""optional smoking"" even though the sign on the door indicates non smoking. Called front desk again while gentleman was spraying room with deodorizer and indicated that I needed to have room changed because smoke was too strong. Offered a new room as a down grade because they had nothing comparable available. There was a gentleman on the floor checking that rooms were cleaned. Told him what we experienced and he said he will look into it and call the front desk. 2- I went down stairs to get new keys for new room. Gentleman was very apologetic and did his best to fix a bad situation. Moved to room 2172, smell of bleach and room is downgrade from what we were moved from. 3-Next day moved to room 2179, same layout as room 2180 just reversed, go to lunch and come back to discover air conditioner isn't working. Call to inform that the room smells like something is burning and no cold air coming out of it that it is making a loud noise and we turned it off. We leave room to enjoy last hour of pool and come back only to find no one has been to room to check air conditioning. Good thing it wasn't burning, right? They finally show up to the room 2 hours later and have to replace parts. Really not the way I wanted hubby to celebrate his bday weekend. Disappointed. Attempting to check out of room and after reviewing the bill the credit which was supposed to be applied to our bill wasn't. Go down to the registration desk to ask them to make correction on bill and get a copy of my final bill. The staff can only do their jobs and hopefully they can do them well, but some of them just don't care and go thru daily motions. This facility doesn't have any pride in the appearance of the hotel.

Beyond that ---- the shower had no pressure and it was impossible to regulate the temperature. Even after they sent up a technician, the shower was bad. We couldn't change rooms because they were sold out. Unbelievable. The last morning I took an absolutely cold shower. Horrible.

The room temperature was also difficult to control. 

In addition, it has one of my least favorite casinos ever. I know that they are notoriously sign-free or sign-limited, but this one was so confusing that we got lost almost every time we ventured downstairs.

We were in a disability\/accessible room. While the bathroom was large, there was no heater or fan. Odd.
And the room itself was small -- king bed, desk and desk chair, one armchair and a tiny table. A big hutch thing for clothing and television.

But dark!!! This was an incredibly dark room! The lights inside the hutch did not work. And it was so dim I had difficulty finding what I wanted in my suitcase.

-First, we checked in and were taking a nap when a hotel staff member entered our room unannounced.
-Later that night we returned from dinner and our room smelled like marijuana. We called the front desk and explained that a member of our party was pregnant, and requested a new room. They told us that they were completely sold out and had no rooms available, but that someone would be up to freshen our room and send security to investigate the smell. They did offer to waive the resort fees, so at least there was that. However, 30 minutes later, nothing. 
-We called again and pushed a little harder, and they came back and said that due to a last minute cancellation, they happened to have a room available. They told us to come down and get new keys. However, when we got there they told us they couldn't give us new keys because we did not bring our IDs down, even though they never mentioned that's what we needed to do. They were completely rude and condescending throughout the whole process.
-While we were standing in line to get our new keys, we overheard another customer ask if there were any rooms available and they said they could absolutely accommodate his request. 
-We got our new room, and after returning from our evening activities, our NEW room also smelled like marijuana. Our best guess is that it's in the vents somehow. At this point we started looking online and discovered that others had posted about the same experience. Turns out the rooms smelling like weed is a common thing, even on non smoking floors. 
-We were told at check in that we could call the next morning at 9 am to see if a late checkout would be available till 1 pm for free of charge. When we called to see if it was available, they said that today it was actually only till 12. I asked why the difference, but was not given an explanation.
-When we checked out, the resort fees were still on our bill. When we asked, they said there was NO record of our complaints and room change the night before. She finally said she could remove it as a courtesy, but scolded us for not knowing the names of the people who promised that the night before. 
-During our checkout, we mentioned that we had read online that others have had issues with their rooms smelling like marijuana, and if this was something the hotel was aware of as a common issue. She would not give us a straight answer and just kept saying that smoking marijuana is legal in Las Vegas, but illegal in the hotel, and that if people were caught they would be charged a fine. 

There seems to be no effort or concern for customer service or to improve the hotel experience. In the end, we ended up staying another night in Vegas but switched to another hotel because our experience was so poor.",2,0,0

We found the hotel on the strip right away but finding the parking garage was tricky. We got a little lost but eventually found the garage. It's nice that they offer free parking but I didn't realize that if you park in the garage you then have to walk with all your luggage through the mall. It wasn't a quick walk either! The hotel itself is really nice and we were really happy with our room even though it was very standard. It was clean and modern and we were really comfortable. 

Pros:
-We loved the nearby restaurants. Burgr is in the lobby and was really good. We also liked cabo wabo cantina and pin up pizza. 
-attached to the mall so easy access to the shops
-super convenient if you're seeing Britney. You just take the elevator down from your room to the lobby. It was also nice seeing her face ALL over the hotel. It helped get us even more excited than we already were.
-reasonable rates


Cons:
-pool! And this was a big, big con for me! That pool area was so disappointing! You walk outside and it's this big ugly concrete landing with pool chairs and a few daybeds but no pool in sight. We walked around extremely confused before we found the damn pool. They have two boring rectangular pools: one for all ages and one that's adults only. They pools are are at a higher level than the concrete landing with all the chairs so unless you rent one of the few daybeds or cabanas surrounding the small pools you're stuck laying out on the concrete landing without even a view of the pool. I was really bummed. 
- inconsiderate maintenance staff! At 4:15am we were awoken to someone banging loudly on our door. We had only been in bed for about two hours but the banging woke us up and we were all super confused. We went to the door and asked who it was (without opening the door because we didn't know if it was just a drunk crazy person) and he yelled that he was maintenance and our neighbors had complained that our toilet was running and it was keeping them up. We told him that it was way too early and we were sleeping and the front desk needs to call us and explain the situation before just sending someone up to bang on our door at 4am. The whole situation was just completely inappropriate. Every hour or so our toilet would make a running water sound but it wasn't even that noticeable. We were sleeping in the room with no issue and the sound was not disturbing us. The from desk called us and we told them that they could send someone up at 7am. They didn't even offer an apology about waking us up. We were really pissed.

I really like the fact that it is in the middle of the strip!  just makes it convenient and it doesn't kill my feet as much!  one day I can explore one half of the strip and the next day the other side!  

I also like being attached to the miracle mile shops!  it's nice to have options.  if you are hungry and it's late then Earl's is super yummy!  I trust coffee and tea from a more reputable location such as the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf rather then the unknown cafe downstairs.  If I need basics like water or chips I can go to the ABC store cuz there is no shame to saving a few pennies when you will be spending $10-$15 on a shot!  Lastly, if I just get bored (as I don't gamble or go really crazy in the party scene) I can go shop!

my reason for taking one star away is because of their pool situation.  They have two regular, nothing special pools on two separate ends.  there are maybe 10 chairs next to the pool that are free and the rest  of the seating are cabanas and couches for a fee.  the rest of the seating are a few steps down and away from the pool!  annoying!  I can't even see my stuff from the pool!  I would have had no problems renting a cabana, however they were tiny little tents (maybe 10x10..maybe a bit smaller) and they barely fit more than 3 people (we had a party of 8) with a tiny little fridge.  And all it costs for such luxury was anywhere between $325-500 depending on the season.  no thanks.  I'm not cheap by any means but if you saw these cabanas I think you would agree! 

Lastly, just because it's 90 degrees outside does not mean that you make the pool's temperature below freezing! Slight exaggeration, I know, but I could barely get waste deep cuz it was sooo cold!  there was no way in hell i was going to dunk my head in that water!

We spent a little over an hour getting fleeced by their one armed bandits.  I told my wife I was tired and wanted to head back to our Red Room at Paris.  

About one or two pulls later she hits a jackpot for 50,000 pennies (a whopping $500).  Alarms are buzzing, lights are flashing.  Then the machine goes haywire and the software conveniently crashes.

Funny there were no errors until we won.  We'd played this game before and watched others play it.  When finally someone won the jackpot PH calls it a malfunction.  We must have done something wrong.  The gaming manager came and tampered with it, likely destroying any evidence of their fraud, then offers to call the gaming commission.  He says I have to option of waiting for these likely corrupt gaming officials, state government employees, so that I can lodge a formal complaint.  

Well my time is too valuable.  I'm not waiting for them.  So we cash out what credit we have remaining on our games and leave.

It took one hour for me when I was checking out. Reason? Because whatever they charged was not matching with my credit card statement. They will charge you random amount which will be difficult for you to understand. Not even they could understand when I ask them to define. For example, they will charge 68$ to your credit card which would be 1 day resort fee (i.e. 48$) and rest of 20$ would be your partial 1st day hotel charge. In short, your credit card statement and checkout summary page will not match. In this pattern, they charged me for the restaurant where I did not go at all. I was so mad and asked them, what is this? They said.. we just posted it but we did not charge it. I was like.. if I did not go to that restaurant, then why you even post it? They had no answer. By making this pattern, most of people do not verify credit card statement and checkout statement.

Tacky solicitors for on sight sales at the front entrance of the Casino and on the main thoroughfare of the Casino floor.  Most guest really despise this.  They also have problems with some table dealers trying to give unsolicited advice on how to play a table game.

Once in the theater I was assisted by Judith & later Mary who worked very hard to accommodate a last minute seat for a 3rd person to be near us.  I was so happy with their kindness and effort all to make our experience great.  Very well done - I will definitely try to see more shows there!  As far as the Jackson go - they've still got it!

The rooms themselves aren't bad and pretty spacious ... but for the price, you'd expect a little better quality.  It's one of the older hotels, so I guess there should be some leniency ... but with such a grand hotel like the Cosmo right across, it's hard to not compare.

Valet or Self-Park. The self park parking structure is sooooo far. Terribly designed if you ask me. You would have to walk all the way through the Miracle Mile shops and go downstairs before you get to the hotel check-in.

Checking in \/ Checking out:
We got there 30min before the actual check. The guy at the counter said our room was ready BUT it would cost an additional $15 to check in early. Are you serious? $15 for 30 minutes? This place is that desperate for money?... So we sat around for another 30 minutes (along with other guests who didn't want to pay the early check in fee) and sure enough when it was exactly time to check in, everyone came out of nowhere and the line got pretty long.

As for the checking out process, for some reason our check out on the TV didn't work. So I had to call the front desk and they checked us out there.

Room:
We got the ""Predator"" room. I have to say, opening my eyes first thing in the morning to a framed image of Predator on the wall right next to my bed with his creepy face staring back at me is not something I wanted to see. Luckily the bed was comfortable. The AC in the room was a bit outdated. It didn't tell you what the temperature was at. The only option you had was ""Hi Med Low"" and another switch to make the room cooler or warmer. The curtains for the window didn't really do a good job blocking out the morning sun. Part of the reason why I woke up was due to the sunlight coming through the sides.

As for the bathroom, it was nice and spacious. Plenty of counter space. There was a separate area with a closing door for the toilet. You had a choice of either a standing shower or a pretty big bathtub.

What I liked:

Beautiful décor. 
Decent slots. My new fave is Sword of Destiny.
Servers are on the ball on casino floor. Rarely wanted for a beverage (and I can suck them down).
Standard room was OK, though shit view. Clean. I liked the Fridge and coffee maker; I usually stay at Mlife casinos & never got that. Nice big separate tub. 
Free self park (Mlife hotels charge now).

What I hate:

The super long slog from self park to reg\/room. You have to drag your junk through this long fancy and crowded mall. Then through busy casino. It was horrible, and I had to go back to car twice that first afternoon! It kicked my ass. If you have leg probs be warned. It's literally a 20 minute hike to your room. I lost more than an hour I'd have liked to gamble, but instead was walking my ass off.

Poor signage. I was constantly lost or worried I was walking in a direction for nothing. They really need more and better signs. 

Casino has no less than three major entrances on strip. Crowds just come pouring in. I was here on a Monday and Tuesday. My hotel room area was very quiet, so the crowd downstairs are mostly nomads. This also means more scummy homeless dudes stalking around. I really hated that, and much prefer places where those staying at the casino are your crowd. 

This is minor, but the pillows in the room are HUGE. Like sofa cushions. I found the very uncomfortable. If you have neck issues bring a pillow from home.

Just not enough actual Hwood memorabilia. Mostly photos. C'mon. This is Planet Hwood. The only actual iconic thing I saw that was not a framed pic was Data's costume from Star Trek. Weak. 

The resort fee is just a thing they all do now, but 35 bucks is steep. You have to pay extra for internet, and I don't use the gym or pools, so its a burn. I got comped, but still paid almost a hundy after fees and tax. 

I like this casino, and my room. I'm sad to knock two stars off, but the giant hike from parking, and charging for internet on top of resort fee, just keeps it from being Great. 

The unreasonable hike from parking will keep me from coming back. But if I do, I'll pay for valet.",0,0,0

We arrived on Thursday afternoon around 3pm and the check in line was not long.  But on Friday around the same time it was HUGE.  There was a good hour wait or so for our friends.  The lobby is very dark, as is the case with the rest of the hotel.  The hallways are very dark, and the inside of the room is not well lit.  The bathroom lighting was decent though.  The toilet worked randomly and took forever to fill up.  If anyone nearby flushed the toilet or took a shower, there was a deafening roar in the bathroom, and it was enough to wake you from a sleep in the next room.  I shut the bathroom doors which helped a little.  We were on a non-smoking floor but that didn't stop anyone from smoking.  We asked to move rooms after we were stuck next to some jerks that spit on the walls, kicked newspapers up and down the hall, smoked, and fought with each other all night.  The staff accommodated us well with our request.

I didn't like getting ambushed by the people trying to sell you PH condos or whatever they are doing.  They try to rope you in with free tickets to things or game credit if you go see their new towers.  They nail you coming right out of the check-in line, which I thought was pretty amateur.

The bed was decent and the room was clean.  There was a nice flat screen TV if you have time to watch it.  Each room has a theme with movie props in it, which was kind of cool.  The air conditioning was not working well in either of our rooms.  It seemed to be blazing hot or freezing cold, and could never quite get a nice temperature.
The casino was nice with plenty to do.  We hung out at the sports bar to watch some games.  The Earl of Sandwich shop has very good hot sandwiches for great prices.  There is a Starbucks right in the casino if you are into them, but if you walk out into the Miracle Mile shops there are a couple of other coffee shops very close by.  The buffet was pretty good but not as good as others on the strip.  It was around $25 a person, but there were plenty of choices to eat.  It was lacking on the seafood front however.

We are in our late 30's and decided we want to find somewhere more our speed.  I feel old, but when I go to my room I want to get away from the commotion for a little while, not listen to techno music blasting through the paper thin walls from the room next door.

Check in was super easy and the bell people were very friendly. The rooms are huge, clean, and perfect for groups\/friends because the toilet is separate from the huge soaking tub and shower (meaning many gals can get ready at once). Although there are some remnants of Aladdin (carpet and lighting), the former hotel, it is very modern. To my pleasure, it is also not tacky! The prices were really affordable, and a good deal considering the room we got.

The crowd seemed generally younger at PH and the casino was much quieter than others on the strip. To me, this is a good thing! It means you can get a seat at any table you want and walk around without being clobbered by a ride on scooter or fanny pack. Like others, I enjoyed the trendy music and lack of a theme!!!

The restaurants and shops in the Miracle Mile are conveniently attached to the hotel. Not to mention, PH is right on the strip.

location: PH is right next to Paris, across the street from the Bellagio.  It's really convenient to just hop next door or across the street for some good food and good times.  

amenities:  the room itself was not bad.  it was big, the bathroom was huge, and we had a nice view of the bellagio.  they give you coupons to their buffets and restaurants if you stay there, so it's 20% off planet dailies cafe and $5 off per person at the buffet...so buffet is like $10 a person for lunch! and it was decent!  lots of variety. and the pool. a lot of ppl rag on PH's pool but there are two and it was nowhere near as crowded as Monte Carlo's...and there arent ANY little brats running around either.  Very mature crowd, quiet, clean, and nice.  It's not fancy, but it will do.  The staff at PH were very friendly, and very accomodating.  It's a nice, big, sleek hotel that we paid like $110 a night for on hotwire.  Compared to other places charging $230+, id say this was a sweet, sweet deal.  Also, the Miracle Mile of shops gave me plenty of shops to look at unlike other hotels that dont offer anything to those who dont gamble.

So all in all, it was a great vacation and we spent a lot of time in PH, to my surprise.  From all the things Ive heard before I wanted to spend as little time as possible in my hotel.  The bottom line is, no its not as fancy as Wynn or Bellagio or even the Venetian. but it's not crappy either.  It's almost brand spankin new with lots of things to do and it's convenient to boot.  Really nothing to complain about.  If you dont mind the transition period and the lack of a better ""theme"" and wanna save moolah, id say come stay here.",2,0,0

The employees and service at this hotel is really superb.  I ordered room service one evening and there was a knock at my door less than 15 minutes later.  Excellent!

Front desk check in had a long line but moved quickly and the employees behind the counter are the best I've seen.  Very helpful and pleasant.

Make sure to ask for king bedroom and don't settle for two queens.... Even if you're anxious to get your Vegas stay started.  The King bedrooms are great.  The linens are stark white and comfortable.  Similar to a Hampton inn if you've stayed at one.

50"" flat screens on the wall make it easy to view the tv from the bed.  The desk and chair are very nice also if you're here on business.

Hungry?  Go enjoy one of the best Rib Eyes I've ever had at their steakhouse, Strip House.

The casino is a nightmare and caters to the 20 something crowd.  VERY loud and the blackjack dealers wear lingerie... not my thang.

The check-in line is ridiculously long. The staff is generally unhelpful - I can't tell you how many workers watched us wander around WITH OUR LUGGAGE and our wedding clothes looking for the elevators at 3 AM when we first got there. We finally asked someone (yes, I know, I know - speak up and ask if you need something but come on - where's the customer service??). The theme of the room was a joke -- one of Mission Impossible or The Minority Report and the other one, over our Jacuzzi tub was Tom Cruise. 

Another huge problem was that in order to get to our car, we had to get in the elevator, walk through the casino, walk through the giant mall that is attached to the hotel, get in another elevator and walk through the parking garage to get to our car. So, guess what happened when we forgot our marriage license and we were already 20 minutes behind schedule for our wedding...You got it - my groom had to run back through the parking garage, get in the elevator, take it up to the mall and walk through the mall, through the casino to get to the elevator to our room to get our marriage license, then do the whole thing all over again to get back to the car. (I'm not saying it's the hotel's fault we forgot our stuff - I'm merely point out how inconvenient this set-up is to get to your car in their garage).

We get it - you want us to stay in the hotel \/ casino \/ mall and spend money. Guess what - we had a lot of shit to do and see while we were in town that didn't include JUST staying in your hotel, your casino and your mall.

first of all, the rooms seem to be focused on a celebrity, unfortunately for us, our room was Tom Cruise.  fuck.... and the worst part was that in the bathroom PH decided to put a picture of Tom Cruise from his movie ""The Firm"" staring at your naked body.

As far as the casino goes, i feel like the it more for the 21-25 crowd.  they have your slutty girls dancing in the ""pit"" for your entertainment.  most likely to distract you from playing casino games and what not.  

I feel like the only thing that PH has going for it, is its location.  its located pretty close to the middle of the strip, so that everything is walking distance from you.

The Supervisor\/Manager - Roberto acted like We were the problem and stated to us and other customers ahead of us that there is NO GUARANTEE on rooms - It's on request and you might get the requested room.

Roberto is the opposite of Customer Service - He said we could either take this room or we could WALK.

First off, rooms are a good size.  Bathroom is a little strange with the shower and toilet separate which means that if you are staying with 3 other people, no one can use the bathroom while you are showering because the shower has a glass door.  

Then, there is the pool, there are two of them and they are pretty small. Compared to the Flamingo in Vegas, the pool area is nothing at PH.   They would make better use of there space if they used the layout area for another pool.  

Location-wise--great location, center of the strip.  Across from the Bellagio and next to the Paris.  

Now, food-wise. I recommend skipping food at their 24\/7 cafe--Planet Dailies, not worth the $11 for breakfast there.  And the service there was not very good. They could not even follow instructions to leave the potatoes off my plate at breakfast.

Location. They're located right in the middle of the strip

You can walk across the street to the Cosmo
see the Bellagio fountain, 
walk to CVS or Walgreens to stock up on supplies
You won't need a car. You can explore one side of the strip one day and the other side the next.

Plenty of places to eat like Earl of Sandwich, Gordon Ramsay's Burgr, and Taco Bell Cantina which is apparently a fancy Taco Bell that serves alcohol And if you forget anything, The Miracle Mile Shops with 170 stores is attached to this hotel.

Planet Hollywood was featured in movies like What Happens in Vegas, 21, and a few Youtubers did a flashmob here once.

The first thing you notice when you enter Planet Hollywood is how lively it is.
The crowd around the tables, Live music, and the pleasure pit.

The remodeled ultra resort vista room felt very modern and it was a pleasure eating in the room with a view.

Comfortable bed with 4 pillows
Good water pressure to start your day
LED mirrors that make you look pretty
Free coffee
A mini fridge for us to use
Contemporary tub
Two USB ports on both sides of the bed
Plenty of power outlets everywhere
The shower walls, the carpet, the lamp, the clock.. everything just felt.. Well.. Ultra hip

The room is very similar to the ultra hip room other than the extra 100sqft, the wall being curved and you get your tub right next to the window.

The resort vista rooms are also located at the end of the hall so you won't hear people walking by

It's really a good hotel, but here are some things that may help you.
- The curtains in my room didn't quite blockout all the light so you may want to bring an eye mask.
- Self parking is free, but you have to walk through the Miracle Mile shops to get to your hotel 
so you should use valet But I've read valet is full here often so PH may not be the best choice if you need to go to your car a lot.
- Uber and Lyft stops are a 3 min walk from the hotel registration desk.
- No security at the elevators like some other higher end hotels so anyone can walk through the hallway. Make sure to use your deadbolt and your safe.
- There were a little wear and tear you wouldn't see in a higher end hotel.
- The internet here was unreliable. I kept getting pushed out to the login page and was being charged every time I logged back in. One phone call to the front desk fixed the extra charges.
- The pool wasn't impressive compared to other pools on the strip, but they have a flowrider pool where you can try surfing. The price changes daily, but it's around $25 for 30 mins of use.

Planet Hollywood is not known for their buffet or their shows or their nightclubs, but you are in the heart of Las Vegas.

You are right across the street from the well known attractions and restaurants.

To finish your day, you can come back to a lively environment to gamble and a modern room to rest in for a reasonable price.

If you're in Las Vegas to have fun on the strip on a budget, Planet Hollywood is a great choice :)",8,1,4

the next day, i went back down to get my jacket...the jacket was in fact never dry cleaned and in stead was put into a plastic trash bag. they returned it to me still with foot prints all over and acted like nothing was wrong.

I asked to talk to the manager, and a skinny African American lady came out from the back, and offered me $20 and told me to leave and go get the jacket cleaned elsewhere.

++++GOOD+++++
*When you arrive there you can feel the energy that is geared towards the young crowd...with pulsing music, lights behind the registration desk
*The casino is also pumped with house\/hiphop music it almost feels like you're in a nightclub without the $40 Vegas covercharges lol!
*We got a $25 buffet coupon upon check-in so that was great.  The Spice Market buffet is very large but the food is average...We like the buffet at Paris much better....shhhh!  But I'm not complaining about a free $25 food coupon right?
*We played some of the slots and we walked away each time with winnings ..ie. $80 here...then $52...then $60..etc.  We used our winnings for food so our slots almost paid for our dinners...yay!
*All the employees we encountered at the hotel were pleasant and willing to help so we felt welcome.
*The beds were comfy and had down comforters\/pillows so we were'nt freezing or too warm which is great for myself.


++++BAD++++
*The room we got was on the 29th floor and the front desk clerk alerted us it was a handicap room but said it was fabulous. Although the first impression was great the bathroom had a handicap shower which was awkward...not good..my partner does'nt like arguing with hotel employees so I had to leave the room as-is...In hindsight I would've went back and changed rooms...
*The casino area is confusing even though there are signs so if we wanted to leave and check out the Strip we kept getting lost which is probably why it's confusing
*We wanted to see the Poppovich's Pet Comedy Show but apparently they are renovating the theaters at the Miracle Mile so everyone that bought tickets ahead were complaining... Good thing we did'nt buy tix ahead so we went to a show at the Luxor instead.
*Oh yeah the rooms are dark\/trendy so we had to turn on all the lights to find our stuff since it was so dark.  lol!
*When we checked out all the staff wanted to help us with our small 3 bags then we felt like we had to tip each person which was weird.  Even when getting into the cabs the bellmen were anxiously waiting for that extra dollar....maybe we looked upscale but we felt like everyone wanted a tip from us...
*Oh yeah, one we night we wanted ice but the one on our floor was broken so we went down to the 28th floor which APPARENTLY has not been renovated so it felt like we were in Aladdin with Genie Lamps gretting us and an awful blue carpeting\/lighting\/decor..lol !

In summary, this hotel has done a great job turning the Aladdin into a hipper\/trendier place without tacking on huge charges on their rooms.  Also the hotel is large but not as huge as say MGM or Luxor so you don't feel overwhelmed and once you figure out the layout of the casino floor it's great.  Next, the Miracle Mile shops are right next door and it contained some upscale shops  but most of the stores were affordable (i.e. Sephora, BCBG, FCUK, etc.).  Again, this hotel is meant to attract a younger crowd and it had mildly succeeded and you won't find to many old ladies smoking at the slots... Instead you'll see strippers over the tables, pulsing music over the casino floor, and some strong drinks served by hot servers...",0,1,0

the best thing.... in the room was the bathroom. i swear to bob, it was. there's an oversized mirror for the ladies to get prepared together, WITHOUT bumping elbows. there was no waiting or fighting for the mirror which i absolutely adored. Plus, there's a tub in the bathroom for semi-foot spa time after a long night out to the clubs. bathroom is pretty spacious. and the toilet has a room to itself, so when someone needs to do the deed, not everyone has to evacuate the room. the bed and pillows were pretty comfortable, but to be honestly, i barely slept while in vegas. a flat screen tv was a nice feature to the room. 
also, we used the tub as a cooler for all the drinks and alcohol. pretty useful, i'd say. 

the things i disliked in\/about the room was the lighting, unnecessary charge on bottled water, and unequal room size. 

-LIGHTING: it was so dim in the room, which was pretty annoying because i needed light to see what i was doing! we had to take off the lampshades to maximize light exposure, but that didn't even help that much.
 -WATER: they made additional charges for water bottles per night which was uncalled for. it sucked even more because it was required. 
-ROOM SIZE: not that it was a big issue, but one room was obviously larger than the other with a desk, a personal couch and 2 closet spaces while the other room lacked all that. you would expect since we're paying the same amount for both rooms, they would give us an equal sized room. on top of that, they couldn't even connect our rooms when we made request in advance. 

on the casino floor, there were some helpful dealers who were trying to teach the games to my friends. i thought that was pretty cool, since they were patient and understanding to the fact we're noobs at this. do note, not all the dealers were helpful, SOME. 

i love how this hotel is connected to the miracle mile, which has fat tuesday, Pinks and the ABC Store inside. EASY ACCESS FOR SURE. 

i wish i got to check out the pool, but we came during the fall. :(

 i really did enjoy my stay at planet hollywood regardless of the minor setbacks. i would probably venture off to experience other hotels, but i would totally recommend this hotel, to first time Vegas visitors since its up to date with the architect and design, and has a worthy location.",2,1,0

The hallways are dark and scary with ripped and torn carpet. Each room has it's own 'decoration' or motif if you want to call it that. I was lucky enough to get the Fred Flinestone room. I had bones in my room, YEP! that's right kiddies BONES.  it was gross. My other friend was lucky enough to get the 90210 bedroom which did not include bones. 

The beds are extremely uncomfortable, another oddity in Vegas, and the Pillows are the worst I have ever experienced. They are hard as rocks and don't even bend.  They have updated some decorations for Brit Brit, but I am so very, very glad we decided on another hotel when we go back in Feb to see her concert. I would highly advise to stay somewhere else vs this place. What is sad is their location is awesome. They are connected to the Miracle Mile shops, they have a variety of lower priced dining options (PBR Bar and Earl of Sandwich), it's next door to Paris and it's right across the street from the Cosmo...all reasons we thought it would be great!

They also, like many other hotels, charge a daily resort fee of $25\/day

PROS:
1) Location is fantastic; close walking distance to Bellagio, Aria, Cosmopolitan.
2) For whatever reason we got upgraded to a junior suite which was a nice surprise. The room was very well appointed, it had some memorabilia from Dr. Zhivago (including a white dress that was displayed in a glass case. When we walked in the room it scared the crap out of us, because it looked like a ghost!). The bathroom was huge with his and hers sinks and separate shower\/tub.

3) The attached mall is good for killing some time. Grab a 180 Octane drink at Fat Tuesday's, go browse the shops, then go to Earl of Sandwich to get some food to lessen your buzz.
4) The casino was a lot of fun even for us non-gamblers
5) Service was actually very friendly.

CONS
1) The two pools were a major letdown. They're just too small and it just felt like we were too close to all the drunken fools that were hanging out there.
2) It seems the amount of smokers here was larger than the average Vegas casino. It really smelled like smoke in the hallways

Considering the price we paid (hello, a junior suite for $40 on Sunday night!), we were very happy with the choice. BTW I didn't realize that fridges were a standard offering in Vegas Strip hotels. If you want a fridge stay at La Quinta",1,2,2

My room was open, with lots of windows looking out over the pool area. There was an incredibly comfortable bed, TV, arm chairs, safe, closets, and desk; as well as a huge bathroom with a deep soaking tub. And of course- it wouldn't be Planet Hollywood without the cool movie memorabilia.

The staff was pretty courteous, and worked quite efficiently. Even during extremely busy times, they seemed happy to help.

The location of PH is quite convenient as well. It is located near many other fascinating hotels, such as The Paris, The Cosmopolitan, and the Bellagio- which made it fun and easy to explore during the day. It was also home to the Miracle Mile shops, which boast shopping outlets and restaurants for all tastes, desires and budgets. 

The internal casino was very hip and cool, with everything from lingerie-clad go-go dancers, to colour changing chandeliers and disco balls. And of course, PH boasts their own in-house high-end restaurants too; we had the pleasure of checking out The Strip House, but that is a review for another day. 

If you are hesitant to check out Planet Hollywood due to reviews here on Yelp, I would say to give them a chance, as I greatly enjoyed my stay here. I would stay here again, if it wasn't so expensive... though the prices aren't terribly steep, I would definitely file it as a special occasion destination, for my budget at least.",3,0,0

We've stayed at all of the Harrah's properties in Vegas and since Harrah's just took over PH, we were looking forward to staying....

TWO STARS is mostly for the SNOBBY ""don't bother me"" lady at the front desk who checked us in...

I knew before we walked up to her that she was not nice. We politely asked about upgrades (they've given us AWESOME upgrades at Caesars and Rio without even asking)...she told us, ""we charge for those""...then never even offered to tell us HOW much more OR what was available. She was rushing to get rid of us...there wasn't even anyone in line behind us.

The room itself was just ok...had the ""Batman"" room. It was disappointing and smelled like dirty socks. Weird stains on the end of the bed. Euw! The pressure in the dingy shower was more like drips. Didn't care much for the bathroom DOUBLE-DOORS with no locks. No shower mat. The halls are so dark & creepy.

Don't bother eating at the Spice Buffet--it's TERRIBLE compared to other buffets...it's not the best like they claim. The Chinese Food station was NOT good. The service was very friendly.

The PH Dailies Coffee Shop is pretty good. Friendly too. We used Reward points to eat there.

Slot Machines were tight and not many good ones.

The location is the best as its in the middle of the strip so easy to go to all the other hotels. Has a shopping mall with all the stores you could need and plenty of food places around.   This hotel is ideally located across from the Bellagio and is in the middle of the strip, which makes it convenient for exploring the hotels and attractions in the area. 

The casino is well equipped and has enough choice to keep to entertained. If there is one piece of advice I could give is go for the 24 hour buffet in the casino it's only $49 and you can eat as much as you want for 24 hours. The food is outstanding, you have the choice of everything and it is all good quality. 

The room was nicely decorated with each room having a different movie theme (I  had the 'Judge Dredd' room) and is quite large. The bed was very comfortable but the pillows were not so comfortable. There is a big, beautiful bath for relaxing at the end of the day.  

The elevators that I  stayed near opened out onto 'The Pleasure Pit' with near naked dealers and pole dancers... if you are staying with children, this may not be the most appropriate hotel! The check-in line was extremely long, so be prepared for quite a wait when you arrive. The 'Miracle Mile' has some good shopping, there is a great Mexican restaurant that has delicous food and a very good value breakfast special. If you want to really spoil yourself, take a sunset helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon - you won't regret it!

The ""Hollywood hip room"" (two queens) was seriously lacking everything:
- not enough lighting... so dim.
- the room was either too freakin cold or too freakin hot!! I always woke up in the middle of the night freezing or burning up...
- we didn't get any duvet covers?!
- no mini fridge??
- no ice bucket?
- annoying to use the bathroom because the shower wasn't in a separate room from the sink... especially if you're sharing a room with others.
- poorly designed, as my friends constantly hit their head against the glass-framed pictures\/random wall that stick out from the bed... 

Other than that, everything else was okay. The hotel itself was nice... it gets confusing walking around inside, since the place is really flashy. Also a great location with easy access to nearby hotels and Earl of Sandwich (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas)!... but if you plan on clubbing a lot, I'd recommend else where because we had to cab it to xs, lax, etc., since they were pretty far (or at least too far in heels).

this place is sensory overload to the fullest; high ceilings with lots of colors & lights; pumping music, and sexy go-go dancers gyrating on stages all around the gaming tables; though it's not that big, it's easy to get lost in here; the hotel check-in is downstairs, and upstairs is a more serene floor of multiple small theaters (including a comedy club), a red & black themed conference room area, a cool mini wedding chapel, and a couple of higher-end restaurants; very much integrated with the surrounding Miracle Mile shops, which offer fun & affordable shopping; several good cheap eats options (Earl of Sandwich, Meatball Spot, Pink's Hot Dogs); and Britney Spears is still pulling the hordes in at the main theater; best craft beer bet = Sin City Brewing has an outpost in the shops area; Gordon Ramsay's burger place is OK for beer; and there is an ABC variety store that has a solid selection of 22 oz. bombers (including many by Rogue Brewing) for only $8",2,0,0

Nice hotel, friendly staff. Loved the Bathroom, Room was affordable & nice & clean as well. I will say that I don't Like that when I asked for cutlery & plates (3 of each) they charged $2.50 but whatever it's no real sweat off my back. 

Hotel is in the center of the strip & damn near has anything you need in it if you ask me you don't even need to go outside lol. 

They also let us pay our balance at check-in which I also liked.  

Another big bonus...no resort fees!!! 

John by the pool was awesome. 

Beware however if you buy the $35 buffet pass, the Hotel's buffet ""Spice Market Buffet"" gets packed bad for dinner, the lines wrap almost in the mall & can have you waiting almost 2 hours to eat & sadly thats almost all of the nights but hey when there's good food around what can you do?

At MGM their ""deal"" includes a smelly room and a view of the A\/C machines.. but that is in my other review. 

The room:
The bed is soft, the tv size was good, and there was ample closet space. Next to the bed were to rather large night stands... but they were more like tables. There was only one small velvety\/scratchy couch. Great for putting stuff on. Oh, and there is ""office"" space with a coffee maker and rolling chair. 

Bathroom:
Large and clean. If it wasn't just 2 people.. maybe 4-5 girls could fit in the restroom to do their makeup hair etc instead of fighting over mirror space. Plus, the toilet is in its own little room incase someone needs privacy.
I did try out the tub since hey, I'm paying for the room and utilities and I refuse to use that much water at home... :) It was aweeesome! Woo.

Not so great: 
-I was sad their robes and slippers had tags\/bags so I couldn't use them. Boo. 
-The alarm clock was ipod ready, but I don't have an ipod.. and I couldn't figure out how to use it.

There is a really good variety of shops, restaurants, and bars which are all more than willing to help you part with your money although not nearly as eagerly as the casino floor. The gaming area is pretty standard compared to other casinos and it didn't really stand out in any way.

It's right in the heart of the Strip, across the street from Bellagio, and next to Paris.  The Miracle Mile Mall is attached\/behind the hotel, which provides some easy and convenient shopping.  There is a Sephora right next to entrance\/exit of the casino, which is awesome and convenient since I forgot some of my lipsticks at home. There are also TWO Starbucks in the casino. One in the lobby, and one on the casino floor.

There are also some great food options in here, including The Strip House, P.F. Chang's, Earl of Sandwich, and Gordon Ramsey's BurGR.  

At 8 pm or so, the pleasure pit area of the casino floor really heats up and turns into a mini-club. Tons of gogo dancers come out, and dance behind the blackjack tables in the boss's pits. A DJ also plays the latest Top 40 hits, so you're singing and dancing along, and if you were losing steam at all before, the vibe wakes you up!

Really enjoyed staying at Planet Hollywood, and can't to visit again when I go back!",3,1,1

First time getting cabana service and being the one figuring out all the pricing, rather being the one chipping in. But I would probably give this place a 3 star overall, but just had a lot of confusion and questions when the bill came and afterwards. So to be honest, if you are a middle-aged person like myself (31) at time of this review, this is a decent place to hang out. You want some people there but you want to be able to move, have your own space, etc. If you are a guy and looking for young college \/ just out of college hotties, this pool might not be for you. 

Anyways, e-mailed them prior to the trip just to get an idea of pricing, on Saturdays (probably the only busy day of the week) for their 21+ pool, cabanas are something around $250 per an e-mail I received. Later on, turns out get a pending charge on my friend's cc for a different price, $350 or so. But also, there is a charge of fees \/ gratuity for that I believe, could be wrong, but somehow gets to a total of $411. I'll have to admit though, this is not bad compared to other more popular pools. For the cabana, nothing special, has a tv, misters, dirty looking couch. The bottles are cheap though for pool pricing, around $225-$300 per piece. We got 3 bottles, but the thing about this is that you get charged 18% fee on the bottle then 18% gratuity on top of that... so 36%? I mean guess this is all relative speaking, but coming out of the pool with 3 bottles, a bucket of beer for about $1450 or so is relatively cheap. Similarly at a more popular pool you are looking at $2500.

Everyone there was having a good time, the water was brisk and the DJ was playing a good mix of top 40s and 90s - 00s.

Still working out credit card charges, it appears they are not going to honor the price quoted via email. Not really happy about it. Gonna try and dispute it with the credit card company.",1,1,0

The buffet place downstairs served really delicious food, but was way overpriced. I guess that's typical for a city where there aren't restaurants on every corner. Supply and demand... 

The on-site casino was pretty good. Our dealer was super pleasant and friendly; i wish i had remembered his name I'd put it out here for everyone to see... 

The front desk were not very friendly... They wouldn't help us with our boarding passes. Perhaps, being used to California hospitality i expect too much... 

The club, whatever the name was... oh, I remember, Prive, was very disappointing. We were on the guest list, yet had to wait in line for one whole hour, and then ended up paying the bouncer a pretty big sum to only get in and get totally disappointed. 

The lobby is a maze and it's not hard to get lost there... 

The housekeeping manager was very nice. I came back home and realized i had left a piece of clothing there. Called them, the housekeeping manager was a sweet lady who promptly returned my phone call after I had left a voicemail, and shipped my item back to me at a pretty reasonable price...

 I got to the hotel at noon. They wanted $28 extra to check in before 3pm.  I refused, so I walked around the mall for a few hours then came back to check in.  No big deal, rules are rules.

The casino doesn't look like anything Hollywood.  It looks more like an abandoned set from a Beck video.  Leftover 70s glam, with the gold and rounded rectangles.  

They only offer free internet for only one device.  So I can use Wi-Fi on my laptop, but not on my phone or iPad.  Even McDonalds has free WiFi, I don't know why a big fancy hotel wouldn't.

They don't have any premium channels on TV.  Just Spike and Comedy Central.  This is Vegas, so you shouldn't be watching TV anyway, but I'm here on business so I am not going to be out partying.  I've stayed in dicey-ass weird motels in New Mexico that had better cable than Planet Hollywood.

But all of that was fine.  Cheap room, crappy amenities, right?  Well....

As I walked up to my room, the cleaning ladies were still in the hallway.  There was an empty 12 pack box of Pabst sitting in front of my door.  Nice, huh?  A sign of things to come.

Both the sheets and the comforter were stained.  There were huge 4"" long orange dog hairs all over the room including on top of the comforter, and there was a weird Velcro mustache or something rolled up and thrown in the corner.  When I called to ask for new bedding, I got some attitude, and a comment that if there are extra people staying in the room they're going to charge me extra.  Nope, just me.  I didn't want EXTRA blankets, just CLEAN ones.  Just one person who doesn't want to sleep on top of someone else's stains and dog hair.

Those color-changing floating mattresses way up above were cool.
The casino lay-out seemed more spacious than most places.  I was tempted to stay a while & play some slots.

HOTEL
Checking in:
We got two rooms and checked in around 2ish and was told to come back around 3-4 and our rooms would be ready. At our initial clerk, we asked for joint rooms too. Because Two people separately bought the rooms, I didn't want to try the 20$ trick :\/. We did our thing, and came back into the Keys line. The guy said the room wasn't ready yet, but hooked us up with the bigger room. From a Hollywood Hip to a Resort room fountain side. The rooms weren't jointed but was one room apart. 

Room: The room itself was pretty big, the bathroom was super huge. Now here are my complaints. One night, a guard interrupted our pre-gaming and told me that this is a 2nd complaint and they can kick us out. I told him that's kinda bullshit because we never received our first complaint, so sorry we were loud. Eventually we saw who our neighbors were, some old couple. One of the rooms showers were handicap, so that room's bathroom floor would be soaked. One of the doors on the cabinets were broken, and we figured whatever, we are not in the hotel that long anyways. 

CASINO
Casino: Really con-fricking-fusing. Everytime I am on the casino floor, I think i know where I am going but it took all 3 days of my vacation to know where to exactly go. I really do not like how there is no main pathway, it's really a cluster of everything in a circle.

TLDR: Got a room upgrade, but got complaints i've never received, and faulty items in the room. Casino is a cluster F-bomb. Has a good location and price, but I think i would spend a bit more and stay else where.",0,0,0

 I didn't like the $100 added on ""Service charge"" when we got there, for using the internet, gym, and pool.  Just put it on the bill right away when we book, not throw it on when we show up, like some weird Xmas surprise! 

We negotiated it off, because it was too cold to use the pool, and I told the mgr.  I wanted to specifically avoid my stupid phone, computer, work people, & the gym; this was my vacay (he laughed). He warned us this is a common charge when booking hotels in Vegas, so be aware. ugh. I then began my vacay, restfully avoiding the above four things. Thank you, God! :)

One thing was that the bathroom water in the toilet area had an incredibly bad sulfur smell. It was so sickening that we almost changed rooms. I literally couldn't wear my contact lenses, it burned my eyes so bad; I had to wear glasses the next day. 

I loved how most people were extremely dressed up at the nightclubs, wearing dresses and suits and heels, looking their best. Very cool. True Vegas. Really fun for girls. No slobs. Loved it. Very sharp. Men in suits. Girls in dresses. Yes. This was a change from the first time I went to Vegas ten years ago, it was pretty sloppy; I wasn't impressed or eager to go back at all, to be honest. Things have really changed quite a bit since then- lots of new clubs & an upscale crowd. Just had a super-fun time. 

I loved being close to all the bars and shopping and everything downstairs. PH has a ton of restaurants and clubs all in one radius. It was soooo nice, especially if you don't want to drive. We did go to other places, but it was cool there, too. We got bottles of liquor and had drinks & champagne upstairs a few times to save a few bucks. But them we blew it on $28 room service pizza an equal number of times. Darn you to heck, alcohol and your bad fiduciary decisions!

First, we got to our room and noticed a faint smell. We unpacked and as we did so, I stepped in a wet spot on the floor. I quickly put my shoes back on and decided that not even socks were OK in this room. After we opened the bathroom doors, the smell got stronger... And, then even stronger a few hours later. 

Later that evening. I sat on the edge of the bed, and the mattress fell through the frame. Looking around, I noticed that the furniture was pretty beat up as well. 

We were only there two nights and it was on the second night that we decided to turn on the TV... Nope it didn't work. 

BTW-Did I mention, this was an upgraded room? I think not. It was pretty small, and by no means anything like any upgraded room I've stayed in before.

Attended the Linkin Park concert with a friend this past weekend. Ticket stub said 9:00pm.  Didn't say if doors were opening earlier, or if that was when doors were opening. We arrived at 815pm, parked in the lot across from the parking garage on Audrie Lane?..whatever the road is behind there to access the parking garage.  
Got to the venue at 830pm. There was a line, as expected.  We started walking to find the end of the line....and walked, and walked...and walked. We actually stopped for a beer at Ocean One Bar and Grille. Took it to go as the line seemed to be moving. We walked, and walked, and walked...finally ended up by Cabo Wabo, which is the complete opposite end of where we started!!! It's now 850pm. We ask the security guard directing people into line, if all of these people are going to get into the venue in time for the show in 10 minutes. She shrugged. We asked if my friend's Diamond Status with the hotel had any ""help"" for us getting in quicker, again no clue. We decided to forego standing in line and headed through the casino to the other side where we started. The band was playing already. :\/    I went up to a security guard by the door and asked about the Diamond Card and sure enough, we got right through, no waiting. Had to chug our beers.  ""Beers"" as in another we bought expecting to wait a long time. I feel bad for the people that were in line on the other side of the mall. Linkin Park played about an hour and 15 minute set, and I'm sure those at the end of the line saw maybe 20 minutes of the show at the most. 

They seriously need to open the doors earlier, or find a way to move people in quicker because it's just not working....",1,1,0

This hotel is in the center of the action and close to tons of great restaurants and shopping. Hard to beat the location for the price we paid. The rooms are also pretty spacious as are the bathrooms. The casino was great - definitely a younger\/wilder crowd which was just fine by us but keep that in mind if you're not looking for that. We also ate at a lot of the restaurants inside PH - Yolo's, Planet Dailies, Koi, and Spice Market Buffet. Koi was DELICIOUS as was the buffet. Planet Dailies wasn't too bad either. Yolo's...I probably won't go back.

Bad: We had two rooms adjoined, and both were kind of dumpy and outdated. One of the rooms' bathrooms (room #788 to be exact!) smelled like sewage the entire time we were there. Like an unbearable sewage smell that literally made us gag when we had to use the bathroom. I called three times to have someone look at it but not sure if they ever actually did. It was really disgusting. Also not one but BOTH of the safes in our two rooms didn't work. Lastly housekeeping left A LOT to be desired. One of the days they cleaned our rooms, out of four beds they only made one of them. It was bizarre. They left all trash and empty bottles, food containers, etc. and didn't throw any of it away the entire four days\/three nights we were there. We ended up piling it all on a room service tray and setting it outside our room the last night just to get it out of there. Really terrible service. OH and I can't forget the pool! Pretty small and an odd setup (but my crew and I still had a blast regardless). I HIGHLY recommend reserving a cabana or at least a daybed if you plan on using the pool. We did a cabana for around $600 for the entire day + a bottle and some mixers. It was worth it to have a decent amount of space for our group and also plenty of shade when we needed it, but the service was pretty terrible the entire day. I think it took about an hour for them to bring one of our drink orders; the servers just seemed generally confused. Also the cabanas all look about five years overdue for an update. They could use a MAJOR facelift.

All said and done, I probably would stay here again but only if I got a good deal on our rooms like I did this time. I would never pay regular price for a room here; plenty of much nicer places on the strip to get your money's worth. Pretty much got what we paid for on this trip - luckily it's VEGAS so we were out and about not spending much time in our room anyway!",1,0,0

From the second we arrived to the hotel, service was slow. We waited for valet and for a bellboy to come get our belongings. When I got to the front desk to check in the lady told me they didn't have anymore 2 queen size beds available but had a king size available, (yea with four girls, sure), I paid for TWO QUEENS !! The lady finally found one and, after she did they had the nerve to charge us $16 to check in early, which I've never heard of a hotel doing if they have a room available. I've stayed at 5 star hotels and NEVER been charged for an ""early check in."" 
As soon as my friends and I walked into our room it reeked of weed. We called the front desk to complain (it took about 15 minutes to even get through) and they said they couldn't give us another room, (which they could've because the lady at the first desk asked us if we wanted to upgrade) they also said they would send someone up to spray. Well, that never happened! The room smelled like weed all weekend because the room next to us was blowing it into our bathroom vent. We called again to complain Friday night that it was an issue, so the hotel comped our $16 early check in fee (something I feel we shouldn't have been charged in the first place) and sent Security up to look into it. Nevertheless, every night weed blew into our vents and smelled up our room. 
Planet Hollywood's inability to remedy the situation left a bad taste in my mouth. On top of that, the rooms are really small, almost outdated even.

The room walls are so thin I couldn't even hear myself think when the neighbor decided to take a shower.
They have a concierge that is useless! I've used their services at various hotels and this one lacks. I asked to setup a town car airport transfer and the concierge acted like I asked for a trip to mars. He responded oh a taxi? Shuttle? Umm no I said town car or suv, umm we have taxis here or I can arrange for the shuttle bus to come. Even though their brochure says they help with limos and other transportation. He told me they use taxis since the airport is so close. 
I informed him that I stayed at Ceasar's and they had town cars available at any time and the concierge there recommended we use a town car to the airport and then called and set it up.
No such luck here the concierge told me I was on my own if I wanted that.
You know how decent hotels have a sign saying if you forgot any of these toiletries call us and we have them complimentary here, well not at this place. We ran out of toothpaste and I had to go buy a small travel size for double the price of a full tube.

The Up!! 5 star

The Rooms are done nicely.. Renovated from what use to be called Alladin Hotel .. Still has the big room set up.. Their in competitived with other par hotels with their very very reasonable rates.. 

To avail this good rates?? Join the Total Rewards..its a free thing that gives you discounts on all their hotels.. Caesar palace, flamingo, Cromwell , etc

Was proving to my friend how you could get a big rate discount ., Expedia price $69 Hotel price on the  Web $59 now after you join Total Rewards? $39 !!! 

Now the 2 Stars I could had given!!!

The walk to the hotel reception check in is at the back of the hotel..we took the shuttle to the hotel and had to traverse our way ..

We arrived at 11am showed my Total rewards..the receptionist informed me we could check in early if we PAY the $20 early check-in fee !!!! I was shocked at first.. My mind was in a fast track backwards like a Time Machine!! Did I was charged with the Early Checked-in at the other hotels I stayed in Vegas?

I've checked in at the Pallazo hotel 3 Times, 5 at the Bellagio. 3 at the Wynn &1 at the Trump Tower... But was never offered me for an early fee... My High End snobby instinct was triggered.. Told my self .. Really!!!!!!!
I just said  to my mind in a professional calmly voice thats ok I'd wait for the 3pm check in time.. The receptionist gesture was unflattering .As if fine I'll hide your keys.. Go outside and give your suitcase to the bellman 

Overall.. I'd comeback here if I'm with my Budgeted friends .. You'll never go wrong. Cheap rates with a very decent Room...

The rooms were outdated, worn out beds (caved in the middle), and borderline dirty rooms. We upgraded to a fountain view room which had a great view of the Bellagio Fountains, but that was the highlight of the room. The room itself needs a deep cleaning in both the bathroom and sleeping quarters. 

Yes, no Resort fees, but WiFi charge is $13.99. Not much of a deal for the typical traveler that logs in during their stay.

I like the convenience of having the Mile Mall attached to the Hotel which great shops and places to eat.

This was a business trip, but the family wanted to tag along for just an overnight stay. I frown on people that take kids to Vegas and I normally would not take them, but it was just overnight and had them out only during the day. I regret taking them and especially stay at this hotel. This Hotel is DEFINITELY not for them with gamblers in lingerie and strip-bar-like dancing in a Casino slot machine area. With much effort the kids didn't see any of this. I never thought I would have to cover them from dancing, but hey, I brought them so it's on me. I'm just warning people who are thinking of bringing kids to stay elsewhere.

PH offers both of these things. It is almost dead center on the strip, and the price, for the most part, is right (this Mon and Tues. you could have gotten rooms as low as $40 depending when you booked). With that said, the good parts of PH pretty much end here for me.

We booked it for a LARGE group of people, I'm talking 8+ rooms because of the location, price, and the more trendy\/young feeling of it. We all booked our rooms separately for a Mon and Tues night, but on Sunday morning I called and explained that I was the ""coordinator"" of the event and could I possibly list all of the reservation names so we could all be on the same floor as much as possible? The lady said it should be no problem putting us all on the same floor except the one couple that booked a smoking room since those are on a separate floor. No problem. She also said something to the effect that I had 2 different rooms under MY name which I promptly told her was INCORRECT...I had ONE room for 2 nights. She said it must have been a duplicate and she would fix it. Lastly, I told her that I had SEVERAL people tell me that many hotels will offer free room upgrades or comps. to people who coordinate large groups of people, so was there anything she could do? She told me that was up to the person that checked me in.

The next day..

Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. We go to check in around 3pm. Of course NOBODY in our party is on the same floor. I ask how that is possible since I called yesterday and was told it wouldn't be a problem. His answer, ""Well, the person you spoke with didn't block out the rooms."" Okay. He tells me I have two rooms under my name. I ask him how is THIS possible since I thought I also cleared this up with the same brainiac who can't block out rooms. He says he will fix it (I don't think he did. I think I will need to call PH tomorrow when the charges register on my account for a refund because they charged me again at checkout). Lastly, I ask him about upgrades or comps (after it was clear THEY had messed everything else up already). He tells me, no, they don't really do that, but he CAN offer me an upgrade to a fountain view room...I tell them, that's nice, BUT WE ALREADY PAID FOR THAT ANYWAYS!!!!! He scoffs and says, well then I can offer your friends (the 2 we rode in with) an upgrade so they can be on the same floor as us (but not even an adjoining room). My friend chuckles at this and says that it sucks to be me in a somewhat sarcastic voice BUT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO ME, not him, and he says ""excuse me, but that is a 100$ upgrade, nothing to laugh at) which is a blatant lie since we upgraded to it online for $14 from the same room they would have been in. And PS, our TV didn't work, period.

To conclude, the rooms are okay. They're clean, but honestly boring and nothing special. The buffet there sucks (review of that later),I've never known ANYONE that didn't lose in their casino, the location is good as are the prices for decentness of room, but I'm done with them.

We checked in late on a Thursday night and stood in line for over 40 minutes and it was an hour before we were finally made it up to our room. 

The front desk employees were really slow and midway while helping check guests in, would go into the back for 5-10minutes and then mysteriously reappear. We watched this go on for the 40 minutes.

Our first time in Vegas. Our first impression of the PH Room - if you like Hotel Cortez on American Horror Story, YOU'LL LOVE THIS HOTEL!! It would be a five star hotel. Once you figure out the layout (takes about 2 days) you won't have a problem getting around the complex. 

You get absolutely nothing for the resort fee. I should actually contest that. And bring your own toilet paper (lol) there was only one roll (1\/2) when we checked in. Day 2 I left a note for housekeeping to leave extra roll. Day 3 we had to call housekeeping for another roll. Yes, we had 3 guest and 1 roll of paper doesn't last long. If you wipe your ass twice you'll clog the toilet (beware!)

The pillows suck but the bed wasn't too bad. As with some reviews here about bed bugs - we didn't get bit by any so I think our room didn't have any. 

My wife used a UV light to swipe the room for body fluids. Only found one stain on the floor. Not bad, I expected worse. 

Over all we loved the location. It's dead center of the strip. The mall is connected (lots of great stores & restaurants). And the Axis theater has some great shows! The rooms are priced as - you get what you pay for. Any more expensive and it would've dropped this rating to 2 stars.

(The last few times I've been in Vegas we stay at the MGM signature so this was a bit of a change for us.)This room also face directly across from the Bellagio water fountain. This time we are staying in a regular fountain room on the 36 floor which also faces the Bellagio water fountain. The beds are so comfortable and soft the bathroom is large and comfortable it has a separate shower and tub area and toilet(i'm really big on bathrooms usually that is the determining factor when I pick a hotel room).I also like Planet Hollywood because it's right in the middle of the strip and it makes it easier to get to different places and clubs that's a long strip. In addition to the hotel there is a mall right under the hotel on the same level of the casino. I would definitely stay at Planet Hollywood again for his location and affordability.",0,0,0

1) We had to call housekeeping a couple of times for towels.  They cleaned the room but didn't leave towels.
2) Pool is awful.  AWFUL
3) Two ladies dragging two huge suitcases, at least four bell hops standing around,  not one opened the door to let us in the hotel.  
4) Service staff is less than helpful
AND HERE'S THE BIG ONE!
We checked in on a Thursday.  On Saturday, I was in the restroom when all of a sudden water starts pouring onto my head from the ceiling!!  We call the front desk and they send up the maintenance man.  Before we know it, there's a HUGE hole in the ceiling.  We are told the restroom is off limits.  This is on Saturday and we are getting ready for dinner reservations and a concert, which was an impossible task since we now have two maintenance men in our room.  We are told ""thank goodness you guys have two rooms, so you have a bathroom available"".  Ummm........Four girls sharing one bathroom.  Although it's possible to share the one bathroom, we PAID FOR TWO ROOMS so we didn't have to.  This calls for a trip downstairs for a chat with the manager.  We had to FIGHT to get Saturday night comped.  At first they wanted to do NOTHING.  Then they offered a meager discount, then a little larger discount until FINALLY after an exhausting conversation we got the room comped for one night. 
We are then told the bathroom would not be fixed before we check out on Monday.
 Second trip for a chat with the manager.  He had the nerve to tell us that the room was still functional and he didn't need to make any further adjustments for us.  We stand our ground.  He offers to move us (It is now Sunday night)  Four girls need to pack ALL their stuff for one night.  If he had offered that on Saturday including the one night comped, we'd have been happy.  But to move for less than 24 hours is ridiculous.   FINALLY, after another exhausting and long conversation, we get offered 50% off our Sunday night.  We accept only because we've already wasted so much time.
If I'm paying for something, I expect to get the quality and experience that I'm paying for.  Not a giant hole in the ceiling of my bathroom that I can't use for two days.  I don't think the excuse that the room is ""funtional"" and since we have an adjoining room, we have an available bathroom is a valid reason to consider our situation acceptable.  We were PAYING for both rooms.  Never will stay here again.  Management should have been proactive about contacting us to apologize for the situation.   The manager never apologized for the inconvenience.  He actually seemed a little irritated with us.  
I'll stay in a hotel where the QUALITY of my stay is important to the property management. If i could, I'd post a picture of the giant hole.",5,2,0

They also stopped charging the stupid Resort Fee, so it was a very good deal.  

Because we're already in Vegas since a night before, we wanted to check-in earlier.  When I emailed to inquire about it, they emailed me back and said although they can't guarantee there would be a room available before their normal check-in time, they made a note about it and would do their best to accommodate it.  They also told me to drive to the Valet Parking and drop off our luggage at the bell desk so we don't have to carry them from the self parking garage through the casino to the hotel lobby.  When we did so, the bell desk gave us a ticket and said just to call them when we get into our room so they could bring our luggage for us.  Since our luggage was taken care of, instead of checking in early, and we were there when it's their check-out time, we decided to shop first and come back later.  

I checked out Miracle Miles few years ago and I wasn't impressed.  There are definitely more shops now and many of them are affordable for us.  If you like your local malls, you'll be happy shopping here.  

Once we checked in to our room, we called the bell desk.  I expected it to take awhile but my sister needed a nap so I didn't mind waiting for awhile.  But when it didn't show up for over an hour, I had to call them again.  When I hung up, they called me right back to double check the tag number and I knew something was wrong.  Another half an hour past and it still didn't show so I called again.  Finally the bell man arrived and said we checked in our luggage at a different building but not ""this"" building.  I still don't fully understand this but my guess is PH has two different buildings(?) and we were staying at South and our luggage was at Westgate or somewhere like that.  I followed the valet sign and it said Planet Hollywood so I don't understand why I was at the wrong bell desk...  

Anyways, luckily, this luggage issue was the only problem we had with this hotel.  To be honest, before I stayed here, I always thought PH to be a very cheesy Vegas hotel but it wasn't.  Sure, it may not be Bellagio or those new fancier hotels but the room was well kept.  The size of the room was ""okay"" but the bathroom was big!  In the bathroom, they have separate shower stall and toilet.  I didn't use it but the bathtub was also pretty big and deep.  The bathroom was nice but because it was very spacious, the bedroom felt a bit smaller with queen size beds and furniture and therefore the room size was ""okay.""  The room was nice and clean and had posters of an old movie from 70's and the props from the same movie were displayed in a coffee table.  I wonder if each room has different movie and its props.  The amenities were simple but it seems like majority of hotels in Vegas have cut down on them also.  Overall, we were very happy with this hotel and its value.  

One thing that stood out during our stay was everybody and I mean everybody from the casino staff to the front desk and even the bell desk guy who was covered with tattoo were very nice and helpful.  Was it a coincidence that we encountered all those pleasant people?  I don't know but PH should be very proud themselves for having such great staff and definitely should keep it up.  Because when all those hotels on the Strip have similar prices and amenities, I will choose and come back to PH because of the staff and their services.  Oh yeah, and of course, no Resort Fee helps a lot too.",1,0,1

This was by far the worst room I've ever seen. It was dark, no coffee or water, no microwave or refrigerator, limited amenities in the bathroom (no cotton balls or q-tips), no make-up mirror, just 1 sink, tiny shower. The furniture was old and chipped up - every piece seemed to have chips and paint missing. Way too small for 2 people. 1 little window - but that's OK because the only thing to look at was the roof of the casino. Then there's the $13.99 daily charge for internet.

As for the casino: Lots of table games and there seemed to be plenty of options. The slots were kind of weird for me - it didn't feel like there were alot to choose from and I never saw anyone really winning.  I really resented girls dancing above the dealers. In fact, I couldn't help but feel sorry for them.The poker room left alot to be desired. The staff was friendly but it's not protected at all from the casino so it's noisy. The music from the Heart Bar is very loud. In certain areas, the lighting was pretty bad. I don't know how the folks at the end of the table could even see their cards. 

The only good thing about that room was the bed - very comfortable. I left the maid a tip, asked for more towels and she gave us 1! The good things about the hotel: Nicely located on the Strip and an easy walk to other places you'd want to be. The buffett is awesome, the shops on Miracle Mile are close and varied.

My cousin is getting married and decided to have it here.  She was given a discount code to give to those of us who will be staying here for the festivities... I'm at work trying to make these reservations so I left the invite @ home (along with the damn code) but I had my cousin's last name and figured that was enough.  WRONG.  I called the first time (yeah, there were several calls) and gave the last name and the lady on the phone found the reservations, but wouldn't give me the discounted rate QUOTE because I didn't have the code.  SIGH. I put a call in to my cousin for the code, and she wonders why they're even asking if they have her name already?  ME TOO.  I call a second time, armed with the last name AND the code (AWED) for a mere 10% discounted rate... THIS time, some other lady tells me I need the GROOM'S last name as well.  So, it's not good enough now that I have the bride's last name, the code- but now I need the GROOM'S last name too.  WTH?!!!  Does that make sense to ANYONE?  So... again I call my cousin and tell her the b.s. I have to deal with in order to get a QUOTED price for the weekend stay, she's surprised because she had just recently made the reservations for her parent's, didn't say she was the bride nor did she give her last name, all she provided was the code (AWED) and was processed.  SO... the THIRD time I called back I asked to speak with a supervisor.  This new lady had a major attitude, wanted to know what I was calling about, I wouldn't divulge that information I just stated that I needed to speak with a supervisor or her manager, she kept asking what for, what was the purpose of my call... and would NOT transfer me.  Along with that her attitude was very snide and nasty.  She finally put me on hold and I waited a good 5 min. before I realized I was probably going to be kept in limbo as long as I was on the phone.  So I hung up and called again (FOURTH CALL!!!) and again asked for a supervisor, this lady again asked for the reason and I flat out said, ""For exactly this reason- your customer service.""  She immediately put me on hold and a manager came on the line.  I tried to explain the situation that had occurred and he didn't seem interested in it, he just cut to the chase and quoted me the price with the 10% discount.  I will never ever ever stay here, they act like they don't need the business and my cousin has since told me that they treat her like crap and she's having her WEDDING there.  She's threatened to change venue and they act like they don't care.

The hotel is pretty awesome. Plenty to do all in one place. I'd say that this is an excellent place for tourists. Especially those without transportation. Everything you really need for a good time is here at this hotel. You have a nice shopping mall here, tons of food choices, gambling for high rollers and low rollers, lots of entertainment options and more. Their offerings meet every budget.

The service was good from my first call to book until the time I left. Valet is a  slow, though. It has always been that way. 

Early check in will cost you if you want to check in before 2pm. I did not get the fee because I refused service. 

The room was incredibly large. The bathroom was humongous! Large oversized tub. Separate shower..(uninspiring, looks like a public shower...I'll mention now... low water pressure, water didn't get hot enough). Two separate vanities. Loved that... the floor is quite slippery..be careful! 

The room was a ""hip king"" as described. Purple velour chairs, purple, velour headboard. Super comfy bed and pillows. The view from our room was incredible! We had an awesome view of the strip and pool area. We got a kick out of watching people on the surf machine and the night view of the strip..a really nice room overall.

The room was not pristine clean but it was passable. The linens and carpet were very clean but there were parts of the room and bathroom that could have been more tidy to be perfectly honest. Especially for the price. My husband's lamp didn't work. Nice tv- great picture. Room had Robin Williams decor..memorabilia from Dead Poet's society. It was pretty cool!

Elevators move quickly and are equipped with televisions. The hotel is noisy, fast paced and geared towards a younger crowd, which I didn't mind too much as I already knew what I was getting into.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay. We got an opportunity to be connected with Caesars, platinum, total rewards program which offers some pretty good perks. Definitely worth looking into. They have my interest and attention to look into staying at some of their other properties for future visits.

I booked the non smoking ultra hip (newly renovated) king room that was supposed to have simple amenities like fridge and coffee maker for Tues-Sat. Got the email in the morning to pre self check in so when I get there I can just go to the kiosk and put my id in and get my room keys.

Arrive at around 9:30-10ish... go to self kiosk and guess what sign in and it says ""sorry no rooms with my request available"".  I opt to wait in line at the front desk, get up there and the lady kindly tells me there's no non smoking available but tons of the same room ""smoking"".

What other option do we have?  I can't stay in a smoking room.  The lady is more than eager for us to book this ""new"" room with a ""panoramic view"".  We get up there and this suite is huge, def too much space for just the 2 of us.  As we're unpacking I remembered I had paid the first night in deposit and wanted to know if that would be deducted from the $150 a night rate so after we go grab some earl sandwiches (which if you are in PH or the miracle mile shop you should stop by, it's good) I stop by the front desk to ask.  they have switched shifts.  The new lady tells me it's $150 additional to what I already paid in rates.  With tax it'll be around $170 more a night to what I was expected to pay.  Ummm that's not what the lady told us, in short she told us we were stuck for at least the night and to call back the next day for a new room that was non smoking.  I asked is it going to be the room that i originally booked since that's what i was quoted\/thought I was paying for she said yes.

So even this ""fancy"" suite that is now upcharging me $170 more a night has notices (see attached pictures) of water being shut off the next day and window cleaners (and yes they did start at 7am). Hardly a relaxing vacation.  How am i going to pay so much for a night and I can't even be guaranteed water and a good night sleep?

So the next day I wake up at 7 (cuz the cleaners and I want to get a workout in and shower before they shut off the water).  They said the room is not ready but they will make note and to come down at 12 to pick up a key.  So now I have to stay around the hotel even though we have no water starting at 10:30 to pick up the key at 12 and to make sure they don't give the room away again.  I get our new room assignment and it is out of water for another day.  Great.  I get to the room and it's dim, smells a little funky (so  i crank up the AC),  There's no fridge, no coffee maker, and it is not newly renovated.  When I call down to ask that's ""all they have for me""  When I ask about a fridge they said not for that room it's $20 a night and no coffee maker for that room.  Great. Why advertise that way then?  I'm sure if I had stayed in one of the newly rennovated rooms like I thought I booked  my experience would've been way better.

Plus side the tables are nice at the casino, down side the waitresses don't seem to want to bring you drinks when gambling they take forever with them.  The spa is nice and included in the resort fees, the pool is alright, and the rooms are eh.  I mean we didn't die, but we didn't want to spend huge amounts of time in the room either.  I would've been more prepared for the room had I known that was what I was booking.

Oh well.

Reasonably priced
Location (across from City  Center and Belagio, next to Paris)
Easy check in\/check out (arrived at 4PM on a Saturday and the room was ready)
Great buffet (champagne brunch)
Great steak house (Strip)
Large bathroom with a lot of counter space (ladies... for our makeup, hair products and everything else we bring along)
Peep Show was fun and entertaining (seriously, other reviewers, it's Holly Madison...what were you expecting?)

No A\/C in hallways or elevators
A\/C in room does not get very cold 
Furniture is old, scuffed (found hair in drawer! OMG!)
Matress is lumpy
Thin walls

We had a strip view room. Great view of Belagio fountains! The bast part was (and I would highly recommend if you like to people watch as much as I do) we had a view of the 21+ pool! Watching guys fist pump as girls tried to get away...priceless!

Having stayed at PH in the past, I had decided to return since the other Caesar Ent hotels are worn and tired based on previous stays.  My stay was midweek when occupancy is not as great as the weekend.

The arrival experience at PH was less than pleasant.  If you self-park, it is quite a trek to registration through the shops, dodging visitors, through the casino and down to the front office.  Having waited in line for 35-40 minutes to check-in, it was my turn to be assisted by one of the five agents.

The desk agent advised me of the $20 per day resort fee that I would be charge and the inclusion (internet for one device, gym access and LOCAL CALLS).  Free local calls - I guess that benefits those who do not have cell phones?!?

While I was aware the recently added resort charge at PH and other Caesar Ent hotels, I was shocked when she asked if I would like to get my keys now for $15 for ""early check-in.""  Check-in time is 3:00PM and it was 2:40PM.  Seriously?  The room was vacant and ready and check-in time was 20-minutes away.

PH will be happy to know that I paid the fee, plus the tax that was not disclosed at C\/I.  There was a line already formed for those there to pick-up their preregistration keys.

If I would have known in advance of this fee, I may have timed my arrival differently.  Guess I should have read some of the reviews on Yelp before my visit.

The guests rooms are okay; the rooms are dark with small windows.  The bed\/mattress was not comfortable. Even though the minimum bet at the table games is $15 the casino doesn't have an exciting ""vibe"". The dealers are pleasant and engaging. 

Okay, a few pluses - the room was relatively clean, the bathroom is large, there is a separate adult pool, Earl of Sandwiches has good offerings with an efficient system and PH has a good central location on the strip.

With the addition of the fees, the resorts across the strip are a better value - newer, fresher product with better service.",4,1,1

Our carpet in the room had a huge wet spot right by the door. 

The room reeked of weed! Was such a strong smell.

The lamp was broken

The phone didn't work

There was no mini fridge. 

Horrible lighting...so dark in the rooms. 

Showers didn't get hot

AC had a burning smell. So bad we had to turn it off. 

At 10:45pm, we got a knock on our door and it was maintenance. He said I need to come in and change a bulb in the bathroom. It was just me and 1 friend at that time and we didn't call and didn't want some random man coming into our room. We told him we didn't call and there was nothing wrong with the bathroom light, but he said he needed to get in to change it. All he said was ""maybe housekeeping called"". He refused to leave and walked right pass us into the bathroom, just to flip the lights on and then leave. Super sketchy, rude, unprofessional and annoying!

My other friend got her own room and her key deactivated on day 2. She went to get a new key card and they refused to give her one because she didn't have ID. Makes sense why for security reasons, but how could she show ID when it was locked in her room!? After a while of her arguing that point, they said they would send someone up with her to check ID when she opened the door. THEY MADE HER WAIT 20 MIN BEFORE SENDING SOMEONE UP WITH HER! And then made her walk back down to the front desk to show the ID. The whole process took about 45 min :\/ good thing we didn't have a show to catch!

I had one of them at SFO recently. You see, I was at the airport headed to Las Vegas for work the day that United grounded hundreds of their airplanes and yes, I was flying on United. The best part of the whole story is that my plane was actually loaded, on the runway, and next in line for takeoff when we were recalled back to the gate. I then proceeded to wait around for about 9 hours before I finally was able to take off and head to Vegas. So when I arrived at Planet Hollywood I was in less than the best of moods.

Imagine my delight upon check in when they told me the room type I had reserved was sold out. I was prepared to put up a wild fight for a room, but without skipping a beat the woman at the front said to me, ""And so we upgraded you to a suite."" Woo-hoo! It was as if they could feel my pain and wanted to make one part of my day a little shinier. And they did.

I found my way to the elevators and up to my room where I could barely contain my glee at how big my room is. and since it's the Planet Hollywood the room had a celebrity theme which was Will Smith. There were all kinds of outfits from his various characters in movies and he wore some funky stuff. The site of that alone brought a smile to my face. But, then I opened the curtains that covered the windows that took up the entire wall and saw I was overlooking Paris and the Bellagio water lights display. It was quite a view.

I'm not sure how much the suites cost on the regular, but I'm guessing it's probably worth it as my room was absolutely gorgeous and and spacious. There was a living room with a huge TV, leather couch and love seat; a sitting area with two arm chairs and a small table; a dining table area that would allow 4 to eat or play cards comfortably, a bar area where you could serve up some drinks to guests, 1 1\/2 baths so your guests can tinkle without passing through the bedroom, and a huge bedroom.

the convenience of this hotel was the selling point for me. couldn't beat that we were staying in the same building as our show, so that was a great bonus. the location is also perfect since the mile shops are located within. only stayed for 3 days, but almost felt like i didn't have to leave the hotel. everything i needed was inside.

My room was loud... it was right next to some sort of service area, and we heard what sounded like a roller coaster at odd intervals.  Loud, drunk people wander the halls at night.  I woke up at 5AM to hear a loud conversation going on, and on, and on.  When i realized they weren't going anywhere, I went to look and see where they were to call security (I do not confront drunk people in the middle of the night... no matter how polite you might be, the reactions can be unpredictable, and it just ain't worth it).  Imagine my surprise to discover a half-dozen people slouched right outside of my door.  I asked them to please find another spot, and they were pretty decent about it.  I heard some more random, not as loud blah-blah-blah a couple more times.  Next morning, I come out..., and two of them are still right there, exactly where they were before.  So my bad for not calling security anyway, but they should notice people loitering, and they didn't.

The blinds in the window do not close completely.  I'm sure a lot of the bros who hang out at 'ph' probably don't mind and tend to collapse into unconsciousness at 5 or 6AM and snore right through the sunlight, but I expect a modern hotel to have blackout blinds \/ drapes.  The TV had a blinding green light that lit up the room at night, which caused me to add electrical tape to my list of stuff to pack.  I had to hang a towel over the TV.

We had pretty poor luck in the casino, and a superstitious part of me wants to blame them.  Luck does ebb and flow, but a quick walk north to Paris left us in a much nicer environment... quieter (yet still fun and busy), far better drink service (I tip well, as I see it as cheap drinks, just a hand or two of VP, and to 'prime the pump' and keep the waitresses coming back.  At ph the waitresses would be very appreciative, but then disappear, and it took a half an hour at times to get a refill), and just a better experience.

If you have pretty low expectations, are under 35 or like to party like you are, look at a room as a place to dump your crap and snore off your drunks, you will probably be pretty happy here and surrounded by your type of people.  If you're a mature adult who sees ""fun"" as something more than swilling down cheap booze and screeching, there are so many far better places to stay.",1,0,0

LOCATION:
The location does not get any better. PH is at ground zero on the Vegas Strip. You are directly across the street from the Cosmo and Aria and the Bellagio is one block over. You can walk to all of the cool stuff on the strip including the stores and bars in between casinos. That said, expect a ton of people. Having a great location means that everyone wants to be there, so it will be crowded.

HOTEL:
The PH hotel itself gets very crowded, especially on the weekends. It is way more packed than the Hard Rock. This is not necessarily a bad thing, depending on what you are looking for, but it will slow you down when you have to wait in line for anything (check in, buffet, shows, etc.). 

CASINO:
At night they have hot women dancing on the card tables. It is awesome. They are also fairly quick to bring you the ""free"" booze of your choice while you are gambling. The nightclub in the Planet Hollywood is okay. I suggest skipping it and heading over to the Wynn to check out XS or the one at the Cosmo (I don't remember what it's called). 

ROOMS:
The rooms are nice and comfy and cheap. Each has a different theme. Mine was for the movie and TV show The Fugitive. My friend's room had a mafia theme and they had a bunch of gangster stuff framed in the walls and tables. The TV's are large and the bathroom is huge and has a jacuzzi, a stand up shower and a private toilet with its own door. Very nice and big enough for several people to do what they gotta do at the same time.

POOL:
They have two relatively small pools on the 6th floor. One is Pleasure and that is the only one that matters. It is the adult pool complete with DJ everyday and cocktail service. You cannot go there without renting a day bed ($35) or a cabana ($250+) unless you are okay with just throwing a towel on the concrete and camping out on the ground. Pleasure fills up quickly on most days, so go early if you want a bed. It's worth the money because then you have somewhere dry to keep you bucket of beer, phone, wallet and whatever else you need out there.The other pool has free lounge chairs, but it's meant for families with kids and that's the only kind of people over there. It''s quiet and boring and I don't know about bar service. 

EXTRA STUFF:
Definitely go walk around the Miracle Mall Shops, which wraps around the casino. They have a bunch of cool stuff, but most of it is expensive. There is a liquor store that has everything you may need as far as booze and souvenirs, but you may want to walk out the front door of the hotel and make a left and then walk over to the Walgreens to pick up a cooler for your room. It's much cheaper to buy beer or cocktails from the store and drink as much as possible in your room before going out.

Finally - don't miss a chance to eat, drink and ride the bull at the PBR Bar in the Miracle Shops area right outside of YOLOS. If you ride the bull, buy the picture they take of you on it, because it makes a great thing to take home.",7,2,1

( it is a long walk) We were at the hotel for a week and noticed people walking through the mall with luggage everyday. I check a few time and i think they had the Valet closed everyday. The pool area was nice and you have to show your room card to get in so it was not to crowed, and they have an adults only pool separate from normal pool the problem was that it closed very early everyday and the security at the door would not let me bring in a drink that i had purchased at the hotel and made me throw it out before she would let us go in.

Parking is all the way in the back of the hotel behind all the shops and another hotel. We had to drag all our luggages through the mile high shops. When we finally got to what we thought was the hotel, nope we were wrong. Apparently half way through the shops, is another hotel called elara Hilton, or something like that, but no where is the name posted. After finding we were at the wrong place, we than dragged all our luggage to the front of the mile high shops, where the casino was located, through the casino and down some stairs to the desk check in. 
The lady who checked us in was nice, but when we asked about parking because we didn't want to drag everything back upon checking out, she said the only way was valet. Basically. They want you to use their valet or you're screwed.

After waiting forever to be checked in, we finally get to our tiny tiny room in which there was supposed to be a view, which we got a partial view out of a window 1\/3 a size of any regular Vegas hotel window.

For starters, the approach to check in\/registration was herd to find --screened off by retail spaces, and not well marked. After 2x around the block, I eventually found it. Check-in is by valet parking, but that was full -- jammed with overspill cars. So I was forced to park about 900 yards away, on the other side of the complex, in self-park. This meant a long walk back with bags, through a maze of elevators, non-working escalators, the Miracle Mile shopping mall (part of the complex), and finally the casino. All just just get to the front desk. 

The clerk found the reservation, and as she checked me in, she asks for a prepaid credit card swipe. Seventy one bucks!  That's it, no exceptions. Now with single room rates about $400 per night, most hotels like this include amenities for free. But no. Planet Hollywood charges $71. Then she explains it's for for a pool\/exercise room\/spa....  And wait for it, WiFi. I'm stunned. I mean c'mon people, even Holiday Inn has a free pool and free WiFi. This is robbery, I'm thinking.  

Room seemed normal enough until I noticed the shortage of AC outlets -- there is only 1 with easy access, on the wall down by the bed. And did I mention the lack of a small room fridge? Zip. Nada. 

Gotta love it.  A $400 room (with a $71 up-charge) that offers less than any Hampton's, La Quinta, or Holiday Inn. Trust me, spend your 400 bucks on a far better Las Vegas experience... I dunno...  somewhere else.",1,0,0

Booked a one bedroom with two queen size beds room through Vegas.com on Black Friday and revived a ridiculously great deal for staying 3 nights.. My friends and I were thrilled to be staying at Planet Hollywood since it seemed hip and with a younger crowd and since it's smack dap in the middle of the strip. 

PROS: 
Location: great since you're in the middle of strip 
Shopping: Miracle Mile is directly below the hotel, awesome shopping!!
Valet and front desk were always very happy and helpful. 4 stars for them. 
Style was modern and the bathroom in our room was large and a good size for a group of ppl to get ready in. They had a separate tub and shower and the toilet had a door. Which is always convenient. 
When I called housekeeping for more towels they always brought some up promptly.
They had $10 table blackjack! 

CONS: our room was very small for two queen size beds. It was cramped to say the least. 
The sheets and quilts on the bed were very cheap and one of the queen size bed wasn't made correctly all weekend long even when the maids came in to tidy up the room. They forgot to put a fitted sheet on the mattress. That was annoying to me. 
The maid only cleaned our room once in three nights. We called and left the sign on the door all weekend. 
The elevators took FOREVER. I am not exaggerating on this. A very very long time. Very frustrating. 
And my final con, is the biggest. There was some type of sewer problem going on through the bathroom sink. Our bathroom smelt like dirty sewer water all 4 days. We called and told them and they never fixed the problem. We tried shutting the doors to the rest of our room, but like I mentioned, the room is small. Our room stunk. It sucked for lack of a better word. 

I know what people tend to say, ""we aren't in the room that much so it's okay not to get the nicest room. "" I agree. But if and when you are in your hotel room, and it smells like dirty sewer water and you just paid over $500.00 for a room, well that is just ridiculous.",2,0,0

But instead this one was decorated to look more oldschool darker, older furniture. There was a pool table inside though! which we used as a bed. LOL. 

Nice thing was that there were two bathrooms. For 8 girls this is a plus. But overall the living room area isn't really my type of hotel room that I like to stay in. The decor was dark so I felt like it was a little dirty? But I realize that its an older hotel so its not the modern type like vdara or elara.

yeah, we could have complained but what a hassle that would have been to gather all of our stuff, move, hope for the best, etc., etc.

If the room had not been free I would have decided somewhere else to stay. The hotel itself is outdated and the rooms are horrible. Where to start... The carpet in the hallways look dirty and every floor smells of cigarettes. The entry light in our room did not work. The linens were clean but the bathroom was not. The vents in the room and bathroom look like they hadn't been dusted in a really long time. The furniture was old and beat up. It had so many dings and scuffs, it looked like it had been there for 20 years. They charge to use the gym and their spa is expensive and they are ""product pushers."" No I do not want your 45 dollar loofa! It was my husbands conference but what I did see of the conference rooms were adequate and clean. The place seems to have a lot of conference space available. Internet is not free and expensive. If you must stay here, ask for a room away from the strip, it was quite, I will give them that. Also, check the mound of literature they give you when you're checking in, they slip in a coupon for the spa as well as the buffet but never mentioned it. I didn't see those till after the fact.

My main gripe about the place all others aside would be that there is no in room coffee! I need coffee every morning and granted most hotel coffee is bad but at least it's available. Here you must venture downstairs to one of two Starbucks and stand in a line with all the other bazillion morning coffee drinkers. Every single morning this irritated me beyond belief. 50 dollars in coffee later.....",2,0,0

Got here early on Thursday and was told I had to pay a $25 fee for early check in. I did but the kicker was the room was already ready, so why the fee then. Next fee...Internet\/wifi is $13.99 per 24 hours. No chance I was paying that. Next fee...phone. I got to my room and tried to make a local call for a dinner reservation, didn't work. Also my room phone didn't always work, you had to pull the cord to get a dial tone. I told the front desk about the phone and they did nothing . They then said that to make local calls you need to prepay a $150 on a credit card. I declined. Granted that fee eventually comes off but not the point. The room quality was not worth the price. The memorabilia in the room is cool but it doesn't serve a purpose other than for show. The bed was comfortable enough but dull looking with only sheets, no comforter, looked like a hospital bed. The furniture was scratched up also. I went in December so it was cold outside. The heater in the room has to kick on every five minutes or so to keep it at 73. Trying to sleep with this thing kicking on was a pain, kept waking up. On to the bathroom. Good size shower and tub, never used the tub however. The shower literally took ten minutes for the water to heat up. This wasn't major as I just let it run before getting in, but at a hotel for this price I expected better. But it wasnt a very strong shower either. The sink water pressure was good and the toilet was also good. The walls are super thin. You will hear other peoples showers. The rooms that are adjacent showers are so loud it drown out your tv noise. You will also hear doors opening and closing at all times so be prepared. The maid service was excellent, came daily. Elevators move quickly but can make your ears pop. The casino is very large but the table limits are higher than Paris next door. The pleasure pit is cool but its just an excuse to raise limits. The restaurant variety at the hotel was nice and the adjacency to the mile shops is awesome. Younger crowd plays here at night, older crowd during the day and afternoon. The location is excellent, center strip across from the Bellagio, but that isn't going to bring me back. Just not a good value for the money when compared to other hotels.

We got upgraded from our original hollywood hip 2 queens to the resort room, and apparently you are supposed to tip at least $20 but i only tipped $5. I didn't' know ok  hahaha or else I definitely would have tipped more. 

Check in was very fast, we arrived at 5, and there weren't any lines at all, there probably would have been lines if we had arrived earlier. 
Our room was huge & spacious, the restroom was probably the best part. 
The view was gorgeous as well, we could see the Bellagio fountains, and the strip.

There was 2 separate sinks, and a separate stall for the shower & toilet as well as a huge bathtub in the back of the restroom.  

Check out took about 15 minutes, which wasn't that bad either. 
The pleasure pit was really nice, all the boobies and everything to distract you while gambling. 

didn't get a chance to go to the pool but will go next time & plan on staying here next time as well. the prices are more affordable compared to the rest of the hotels, and ph is also located in the middle of all the other hotels.

So let me tell you. We check in, get our room key, and get into our room. I wanted to sit in the hot tub for 20\/30 minutes before heading out, and thats exactly what I did. After I was finished and ready to shower, I got out and headed to the shower to find a 1\/4 puddle under my feet, and the shower barfing up black nasty particles from the drain. It was a mess! I told housekeepint to send a technician, AFTER we leave which was 45 minutes, and offcourse, they show up in 10 minutes. After telling him to come hack, he grunted""well, we have to fix it you know"". Yes, dousch I know, my wife is trying to get dressed. Im not going to allow some technician to come and fix the hotel plumbing while im in my room, thats plain dumb. Mind you I was only here for one night. Anyways when we go out and come back, the drain is fixed but still a smelly odor coming from the bathroom(maybe a water leak l that hasent been fixed). I know I know, out of all the rooms I hadd to get this one. They did not accomodate me to a different room, they did not give me an extra hour of sleep, claiming they are overbooked, and they did not waive the resort fee, hence the 1 star review.

Room looked clean, and well put together. Interior was great. We even had a huge air mattress that converted into a couch. Two chairs, assembled into an ample size ""bed"". 

Loved the large variety of stores, even rivaled the shops at ceasar's palace.

I'll start off by saying when I first walked in I was impressed. The hotel had a few nice shops, decent restaurants and a few bars which of course is always good. The outside of the elevators are covered in pictures of Britney which I thought was pretty awesome. I was impressed while taking the elevator to the 12th floor. 

So I step out of the elevator and start to look around. I notice the wallpaper is old and appears to be peeling. It was grey and old looking I expected something more modern and updated. Anyway we get to our room which was surprisingly small. All the rooms have a movie\/tv show theme. Our theme was bay watch which I thought was fun and interesting.

In summary:
1) Lots of drunk people in this hotel. Both nights of our stay, we got woken up in the middle of the night by drunk people multiple times.

2) We had an issue. Security never showed up after waiting 1+ hours.

3) The manager is completely careless of anything that occurs, and has absolutely no sense of customer service. 

More details:
(1) Since it's a lower cost hotel on the strip, it's more young people. Thus, more drunk people. Thus, more loudness in the middle of the night in the hallway after ppl going and coming from the bars\/nightclubs. 

Our room was the first room next to the elevator. Friday night, we went to bed at 12am, but got woken up on 4 different occasions by crazy loud obnoxious drunk people walking down the hall. At some point, there was an idiot yelling and knocking on all the doors, ""stop sleeping, you're in Vegas"". Which is usually true, but we were on a business trip. Thursday night, it was not as bad, but we were still woken up a couple times. 

If you stay at this hotel, make 100% sure that you are at the end of the hall because the closer to the elevator, the more drunk ppl waking you up. Other hotels are not as bad. 

(2) Majority of the hotels have Self Parking near the casino. Planet Hollywood has only one Self Parking at the end of the Miracle shopping center. Thus, if you prefer to self-park, it's a 15 minute walk from the garage to the casino. 

(3) Finally, most importantly, the management and security do not care one bit about providing good service. The front desk manager should not be a manager. I have no clue how he got to that position. 

We were out and my father didn't have the key. He went to the front desk for assistance. They told my father, the security will let you into the room if you can find an item in your room proving you stay there. They told my father (65yo) to wait in front of the room. He waited for 15 minutes. No security. He went to the front desk 3 more times and waited a total of 1 hour and 15 minutes, security never showed. 

I asked for the front desk manager when checking out because I really felt that we should not pay for the Friday night since they made my 65yo father go in circles and never ended up helping him, then to be woken up repeatedly, or at least we shouldn't pay the resort fee for that night. He said we don't give discounts, and basically said here is your bill and get out. His tone of voice and manner was sooo rude. I've never seen anything like it. I was pretty shocked at his attitude.",0,1,0

Check in: Just don't get there at check-in time. We got there straight up at 3pm and line was about 30-40 groups deep. It took about a hour to get checked-in and the line actually was moving faster then I thought it would. The front desk staff was nice & helpful. 

Room: It's ""larger"". We stayed in a resort room and it's a little bigger than the normal rooms...bigger floor space & two sinks in the bathroom. Our room had the Chariots of Fire them...which was a little dated. The layout of the room is odd and the TV (which didn't move) was on the left wall so you really had to watch TV from an odd angle if you were laying in bed. The shower was GROSS...there was A LOT of soap scum and you can tell in the nooks that this place is pretty dated. 

Casino: It's a smaller casino floor but I like that it's more manageable and you can get to your room easily. There was the ""pleasure pit"" if you wanted to see girls on poles dance while you played the tables and pretty much on weekends after 11pm...every table\/pole seem to have a girl on it. 

Food\/Shopping: One of the better things about this place a good mall and some decent food places that won't kill your wallet.

At check-in, they said only incidentals would be charged to the card we presented in person, but upon check-out they said only our first night had been paid for because that's how they do things, they do not allow people to pay in advance.

Where do I start?  The decor in the room is unremarkable.  The window was small with the coverings attached to the ceiling you feel like you are in a cave.  If you are average height you need to stoop to see out.

Pleasure Pool:
We stayed at PH Towers but came through to play the slots and went to the pool. We got a cabana at the pool Friday...it was cool. Waitress was bitchy in the beginning as if she didn't want to serve us. We were nice and everything, she just came up with a stanky attitude...guess she thought because she was getting a tip regardless, she didn't have to be nice. Whatever bitch. Anyway, the pool was a little dead because we got there at 10:30ish. Some other ppl were there, some dude was rude to me because I didn't want him but whatever lol.

The pool started playing music, I think they had a DJ by the pool around 12ish. Cool spot and not too expensive for a cabana (it was 3 of us). We ordered food, it was avg...nothing to write home about. Overall, cool experience..it was 110 that day so we stayed until 1:30\/2pm and then went inside to gamble, which brings me to....

Casino: 

Definitely for the young folk! lol! I'm young so it was great for me. There wasn't any drunk young people running around like others mentioned...Idk where yall was but definitely didn't see that.

Pros:
- center of strip
- nice vibe
- movie memorabilia in rooms are a nice touch
- mall has a good variety of stores
- had a great rate for a strip view room!
- Theater has a great variety of shows

Cons
-valet is slow \/ parking sucks!  Shares parking garage with mall.  When you park, you have to walk through mall to get to your room.  

- Pool is small and un-exciting

I booked Planet Hollywood the day before we wanted to leave on Hotwire for $68 a night. So not shabby at all.

PARKING: We ended up using the complimentary valet. We arrived at PH at about 6:30 pm, so there was a bit of a line. We had to wait about ten minutes for the valet to give us our ticket, but that wasn't a big deal to us. A guy in a large SUV did try to cut in front of me to get in the valet line, but the valet guy totally held it down for me and told him he had to go all the way around to get in line. I could have kissed the valet guy for that! When picking up your car to leave, I really recommend sending one person down early. It took about 20-25 minutes to get the car and it's pretty chaotic. You really have to be watching for your car because while they do yell your name, it can be hard to hear.

CHECKIN\/CHECKOUT: Check-in was a freaking hot mess at PH. I think I have been spoiled by the Palazzo my last two stays in Vegas because their checkin is super smooth and they always have enough people working. When I got in line at PH, it was quite lengthy and there was only ONE person working the front desk checking people in! Awesome. Luckily after about ten minutes in line, four more people showed up and started checking people in. Once I got to the counter, my check-in was really smooth and took less than five minutes. I don't understand why some people take fifteen minutes to check-in, but that's just me. Check-out was really smooth...I did express checkout and just dropped the room keys in the slot in the lobby.

ROOM: We stayed in the ""Flash Gordon"" room which amused my husband and brother-in-law, so there were some props and movie posters in the room and bathroom. We had two queen beds,which were really really comfortable. The room itself wasn't very large and the lighting was really lacking. Even when we had all the lights on, it was still quite dim. The bathroom only had one sink, which totally killed our plan to use the second sink as an ice bath for alcohol. I mean, even the freaking Holiday Inn rooms have double sinks, but whatever.

POOL: We went to the pool on Thursday in the late morning (around 11:30 am). When we got there, both pools were pretty busy. We found one chair at one of the pools, which my husband graciously let me have. Both pools aren't that large; the pool we were at was half cabanas and then half chairs and beds that anyone could use. The pool was busy until about 1:15ish and then it cleared out for awhile and started to get busy again around 2:45. There were only two cocktail waitresses and 1 foodrunner (I assume that is what she was) working the whole pool (including the cabanas), but once you flagged one down, they came around pretty regularly to you (tipping well also helps). There were quite a few fruity drinks available (not my style) and a fair number of beers available by the bottle. I stuck with boring Bud Light and they were $6 each. The pool atmosphere itself was fun...maybe I got lucky, but the people around us were very nice and chatty, so I met some interesting people the few hours I was out. I did have one celebrity sighting that afternoon...Corbin Bernsen of Major League fame. Oh yea.

CASINO: The casino is nice and was well laid-out. Plus there were a lot of signs and things were well marked, so it was easy to get around. Not really a casino I would make a point to stop by if I wasn't staying at PH, but good enough to spend a few late night minutes on the way back to the room.

Overall, PH is a decent place to stay on the strip if you aren't looking for anything super fancy and want a good central location which gets it a solid 3 stars from me.",3,0,2

We came with two other couples specifically to see Britney Spears and were pleasantly surprised with how great the hotel was.  The staff was all really helpful and friendly, we checked right in and found there was so much to offer right in our area.  The restaurants are all amazing inside, the shops are great and it certainly helped that Brit's concert was right downstairs!  She was pretty much ALL over the hotel so it made the experience that much more fun for my girlfriends and I. 

We stayed in February, but was shocked at how warm is was even then so it was really convenient having tons of stores in our hotel allowing us to purchase tank tops and sundresses so we'd be comfortable walking the strip!

The room itself was really nice and clean, bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was gorgeous!  Seems like a funny thing to say, but as a girl spending 5 days in Vegas, you want a nice bathroom to get all dolled up in!  It was also super affordable which is obviously a plus!

For starters, my wife and I are frequent travelers to Vegas and have stayed in a multitude of rooms\/suites. This has to be one of the oddest rooms that we have ever staying in. First of all, No Room Bar.... What, it's Vegas. 2nd, there was the oddly place television, I know that we don't go to Vegas for the room, but with the bed facing one way and the TV on the opposite right wall, thanks for the neck ache. Room was pretty out dated and furniture needs a little work. The shower had almost ""zero"" pressure as well as the room always felt dirty. Here's the odd one, only (2) lamps worked in the room and one had to be turned off by using towel to unscrew the lightbulb...WTF???? 

The Casino is fun, staff is friendly and actually can have a conversation, but the Casino is Small in compared to others. I really don't understand the layout of the restaurants as they seem to be hidden around corners. You'll be walking along and all of a sudden... up pops a restaurant.... Didn't partake in any of their restaurants as they seem wildly out of the way and menu's were not that appealing.

I would again like to say that the Staff was excellent and somewhat helpful, but the rooms were a complete disaster. I also agree with the earlier post on the $25 a day fee for one item use of the wifi and gym use... Very odd... We won't stay again, but we will always stay at the sister casino. Caesars!!!!

The Good:  
1) Location!!!! Right near the new City Center, across from Bellagio and adjacent to the Miracle Mile Shops - Score!

2) The Rooms - OK they won't knock your socks off, but they are clean, roomy and decorated nicely.  The added Hollywood memorabilia is just  fun twist to the room. I also like the large bathroom with the soaking tub - I took 3 bubble baths!!!

3) Check in - I worried based on other yelper reviews, but we literally walked up at noon on Thursday (3 hours before check in) and were greeted with a friendly staff who check us in and sent us on our way in less than 10 minutes.  Plus we got the free bottle with your stay deal - which was a great plus.  They also gave us a lot of coupons to use in the casino and we used quiet a few - surprisingly. 

4) Size - PH is a smaller casino and that makes it easy to maneuver.  I could easily find the elevators, the shops, the lobby and the doors without feeling trapped or lost (like I always do at Caesars!).  

5) Decor - I loooove the fun decor at PH.  It is hip and fun and the changing LCD lights keeps the place lively.  Plus the addition of the Pleasure Pit gives the casino a younger feel.  

6) Shopping - The Miracle Mile shops are a great place to get a coffee or do a little retail therapy. 

The bad: 

1)  The ticket sellers\/timeshare people: OMG how many frikken people need to accost you during your stay at PH.  It was out of control.  It actually is one of the main reasons I dropped my star rating.  At every door there are people selling tickets and positively step in your way to get your attention.  I seriously wanted to hit some of them.  Rude, annoying, and totally made the casino seem low rent.  

2) The room: I liked out room, but a couple things would make it better.  For one, it is very dark, but i think part of that is dark woods and purple decor.  Also, why have a huge soaking tub with no jets?  Same with the sink area, why have an area that can accommodate two sinks and only have one?  

3) I don't usually go to the players club with my husband, but did twice on this occasion and they were not terribly friendly and honestly at times totally unhelpful.  Maybe that will change with Harrah's buying the casino.

My friends were very polite and nice, called up the housekeeping but I wasn't having it. I'm very tired, before flying in Vegas I was working early at the hospital that same day. I expect nothing but the best. I then called up the operator and demanded to speak with the floor manager only to be transferred to a voicemail. That didn't help my mood so I called her back, pissed off. After a few minutes of holding. I was instructed for our group to go down and be given another room.

Once we hit the registration desk, a clerk apologize and upgraded our room to suite instead. So off we go round 2.

We were given the suite on the 22nd floor, in fact it was the Bruce Willis room, scored. The minute we step in the room you can smell cleanliness. Bathroom was huge, plenty of mirrors\/lights and perfect for 4 girls. We even have a plasma tv and view of the strip.

When I explained the error to them, they were unsympathetic and basically told me to go fly a kite.  I had my sister-in-law call while I was standing there.  They said the only way to resolve this was for the hotel to email her a credit card authorization and have her return it.  She did this.

Kinda cool:
- All the rooms have different movie themes, including props from movie sets. We stayed in the ""Eraser""-themed room

When some places try to emulate other places, it usually doesn't come off as well as it could, or should, or let's face it, is just a sad imitation.  Planet Hollywood goes for that ""Los Angeles\/Holloywood"" feel, whether it's the events that it hosts, the celebrities that it brings in, the general vibe, or even some of the eateries.  And here, it works.

It doesn't try to BE Los Angeles.  It tries to be the Los Angeles feel for Las Vegas.  It also doesn't try to invoke the snooty, uber-pretentious vibe of some of the other casinos.  It's a place that just seems to want to have fun.  Not for some people, but for everyone.

The inside mall actually has stores and restaurants that can fit any budget.  The line up of shows are varied and entertaining (from the ones I've seen).  They have some excellent art galleries in there.  There's nothing here that could be considered run down or low brow.  The atmosphere just encourages you to play.

And I've seen some great entertainment here: Film shoots, award shows, concerts, film premieres....  It's a compact L.A. experience without the stupid traffic jams and parking issues.

While I missed out on the Aladdin and even Planet Hollywood for the longest time, when I finally tried this place out a few years back, it stuck with me, and became one of my more preferred casinos.  Hopefully, its still relative ""newness"" will keep Vegas at bay from wanting to tear it down in the next five years or so, but as far as strip casinos go, I can easily recommend this one.",2,0,2

Let me start off by saying that this hotel was my favorite place to stay at during my trips to Vegas. I've been coming to this hotel for 3 years now and I never had a problem with anything until this year.

I stayed here for EDC weekend from June 20th-24th. My friends and I went out drinking on Saturday night and woke up hungover the next morning. We decided that we needed some soup to feel a bit better before hitting the strip for the day so we ordered some hot water from room service (my friend brought some instant noodles in case we weren't able to get out of bed and make it to the restaurants, and he was right). When we called the line for room service they kept hanging up on us. This went on for about 10 minutes until we decided to call the front desk. When we called the front desk we were on hold for about 20 minutes until we were finally able to get through and order some hot water. The water came after a few minutes and we made our soup. We put the pot of water on the table and went on with our lives for the day. The next morning my friend was thirsty and didn't want to go down to the store so he poured himself a cup of water (from the same pot) and the water was disgustingly yellow. We tried to contact the manager at the front desk but we were told that she was in a meeting and would call us back... We never got a call back after waiting a few hours. So we decided to pack all our belongings and get ready to check out.

As we were packing my girlfriend decided to count the money that we set aside for the hotel payment and she realized that she was short $300 dollars. Before anyone starts to think that one of the people staying with us could've taken it, let me clear that up now and say no. We are a very close group of friends that aren't shady like that. So anyway, we tried calling the front desk again and we got the same ""I'll have the manager call you when she's done with her meeting"" excuse. She never called though. Instead, I had to call and make a claim with hotel security and they had to review  the evidence to see if their hotel would be at fault for any suspicious behavior. This case went on for about two months until I finally received a letter saying that they are not responsible for theft and would not be refunding us back the money. I'm very disappointed with the review for our case because all the evidence lead to housekeeping taking the money. I mean, my girlfriend only left her bag in the room (accidentally) unattended twice and this was during the time that housekeeping would make their rounds. 

When I go on vacation I like to stay at places where I can kick back, relax and feel at home. I don't get that feeling at planet Hollywood anymore though. I feel like if I were to ever stay there again (which I wouldn't even if this hotel was the last place standing on the strip) I would have to constantly watch my valuables. I don't recommend this place at all. There are better hotels on the strip that are about the same price as this one. The only reason why I think this place deserves one star is for location. It's right in the middle of everything so you won't have to worry about taking a taxi or driving everywhere.",0,0,0

We did NOT stay at Planet Hollywood, so my review is for the casino and walking thru... (note: I will review Miracle Mile Shops and I will rate much higher for the shops\/restaurants!)

We stayed at the MGM Grand and our first stop along the strip was Planet Hollywood. We walked in and before entering we had observed an ambulance and multiple police cars outside, as well as a couple fire engines. Living in Philadelphia, we thought nothing of it and continued on our way inside. Right in the entrance was a woman-- DEAD. Seriously, she was nothing other than dead. There was a guy with her screaming ""GOD DAMN IT GOD FUCKING DAMN IT"" and punching the glass (mind you, shattering the glass) of a movie display type of thing. It was chaos. We continued to walk thru to the casino, a little shaken up, but like I said, we're all from Philadelphia. People from Philadelphia will know what I mean. 

So, I do not believe we played anything at this time, but when we went back later in the week, this was the only casino we were in where we were asked if we knew ""where to buy weed"" or if we ""wanted to buy cocaine."" WHAT THE HECK!!!!

We called once again and the front desk (mind you, it rang for 10 minutes until someone answered) and they said there were no more rooms, and the only thing they could do is comp our resort fee which is $20.

PH Hotel and Casino is like an LA. night club that knocked up a W Hotel and they had a baby at a strip club located in a mall.

The Room:  We had ""The Fugitive"" room with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones pictures all around. The bathroom had a nice big tub, and the room was pretty modern.  No mini bar though and there also wasn't an iPod docking alarm clock radio.  

The Casino:  Is LOUD!  If you like quiet casinos then go someplace else.  This one has music pumping loud.  There are pole dancers at night in the ""Pleasure Pit"" which is the table gaming area.  

Overall, PH is pretty cool and in a great location on the strip.  The Miracle Mile Mall is convenient and kind of cool.  One of the nice things about PH is that it's part of Caesars, so it's a Total Rewards Casino!  POINTS!!!

There is one thing I should mention.  I was approached by Call Girls on three different occasions.  I'm not into that so it was annoying.

Really helpful and appreciative. And the strip view we had was of the fountains of the Belagio, so we nevwr wanted to close the curtains. Also, the bathtub was magnificent.

But, nothing else was great. The ""suite"" had no couch like the pictures showed, just two chairs. The room had a 5 food diameter piller in the middle of it which made the room awkward. The worst was the service. The room service was bad to the extent of beligerant servers, and when the manager was told, she never apologized or offered to fix it. Just took the charges off the bill when we gave the cold food back. 

Then on the day of the checkout, we asked for a late check-out. They agreed, but 10 min after the original checkout time, they shut off our internet and called us to tell us they needed us to vacate the room, or they would charge us. After an argument and getting the front desk person to agree she did give us a late check-out, we checked out and won't go back.

It looks decent inside and very Vegas'y..BUT i can't like it.

We stayed here this past April and last Christmas in December. Both experiences gave us different feelings about this hotel.

On our April Trip:
We give Planet Hollywood 2 stars.  First of all, when we were checking in on the first day, the line was so long but none of the workers there bothered to do anything about it (add staff? anything?)
Secondly by the 3rd day, we wanted to add 2 more nights to our trip as an extension-(since we like Vegas so much). For some darn reason....OUR keys wouldn't work from then...SOOO sadly on both our 4th and 5th nights, we had to go downstairs (when we got home, tired) around 12 am, to get our keys ""REACTIVATED"" again. UGH...it's the most annoying thing when you walk all the way up to your room, tired, ready to plop onto bed, when.......
your key does not work. The people downstairs kept asking us if we had magnets in our wallet that made that. NO. We don't carry magnets on our vacation.

Get it together, Planet Hollywood!

One very low sitting chair and lights in the entertainment center did not work. Bathroom is huge. Only perk is large bathtub and separate toilet room. Downside is there is no ceiling or exhaust fan for toilet room or bathroom. 
I found fuzz and dirt in my bathtub and while walking in my room barefoot, the bottoms of my feet became black!!!!  Cleanliness is an obvious issue here. No fridge, no coffee maker, no water bottles. 
Buffet was $40\/person. No discounts with my total rewards card. Buffet was mediocre. Many dishes not labeled and my niece and nephew are both diabetic and could not eat any desserts as we didn't know if any of them were sugar free.

There were some things that gave me the heebie jeebies tho. One being what looked like a bullet hole covered with tape and some splatter which to me looked like blood on the lamp shade near said bullet hole and on the bathroom walls.  It was room 1158.

Obviously the maid service isn't up to par. There was several days where we missed the morning cleaning cause hello it's Vegas. Who gets up early in Vegas?  Not a big deal. I was able to catch the grouchy maids in the hallway to get fresh towels.

One one side (admittedly, the back side, and most of us don't look our best from the back), it's a wasteland.  They appear to be building condos, like everyone else in Las Vegas.  On another side, they have what appears to be an attempt to recreate some nondescript 20s or 30s town, complete with run-down businesses.  Just don't go there after dark.  Or before dark (and people say I live on the seedy side of town).

On the third side, you have the Miracle Mile shops, which is like every other mall on the strip, except it's, well, it's another mall.  And the final side opens to the strip.  Blah, blah, blah.

The casino is really pathetic, but then just about every casino in Vegas these days is lacking something since they took away the sounds.  Planet Hollywood is just more so, because it's this big, nasty, empty, cavern that seems to call out to the soulless minions looking for... something.  We couldn't get through fast enough.

I thought the room was going to be modern, sleek and decked out with cool movie memorablia. Our movie items consisted of a shirt and a poster from the Murder in the First movie. The bathroom is outdated and the fixtures need replacement. Had to run the shower water for 5 minutes prior to getting in or the water was freezing. 

Plus side, the tub is huge and jetted. The bed is comfortable and my room overlooked the pool. Shops, restaurants, pools and shows right at your fingertips. Right across the street and adjacent to hotel are many options for shopping, gambling, shows and food.

Around the hallways and guest rooms, the decor is still very much Aladdin themed from the carpets to the wallpaper.  The only real difference is the addition of a hollywood movie or character in each room.  We had the Steven Seagal room, and Steven Seagal's long underwear hanging in a case on the wall is not exactly impressive or spectacular.

This hotel is NOT family friendly.  Two words ""Pleasure Pit.""  Glad I didn't bring my daughter.  I get it, scantily clad girls dressed in lingerie dancing on tables next to the blackjack tables, distract the card players or keep them at the tables to part with more $$.

About the room itself.  It did have a decent view of the Paris hotel and related Eiffel Tower and Paris balloon as well as the Bellagio fountains but that's where anything good about it ends. The carpets were so dirty, all of my white socks were turned black on the bottom from walking around the room.  Housekeeping was quite inconsistent in replacing our glassware.  The grout in the shower was disgusting, the wallpaper in the room was peeling off the wall, the sink was cracked and to top it off, dirty laundry from a previous guest was still on the floor next to one of the chairs in the room - which leads me back to the inconsistent housekeeping and very dirty carpets.  Btw, that dirty laundry was still there when we left Vegas several days later.  The switch on one of the lamps did not work properly, it was loose and had to be pushed on to get it to turn and actually work.  One of the floor switches was either inoperative, or the light it was attached to didn't work.  Room amenities were lacking.  This is probably the first time in at least 15 years or more I've stayed in a room that didn't have so much as a coffee maker in the room.  No coffee maker, no microwave and no mini fridge.  I guess Holiday Inn does have one up on ph.

Ice machines - for the majority of our stay, the ice machine on our floor did not work, nor did the ice machine on the floor above us.  My bride & I had to spend a significant amount of time finding a working ice machine on another floor.  The one on our floor was finally working on the last night of our stay.

Not sure when the casinos in Vegas stopped accepting coins in the slot machines.  My bride & I had planned on playing the quarter slots, so we brought some rolls of quarters with us... but the quarter slots only take cards or dollar bills now.  Sorry, ph, we went home with our gambling $$.

Parking is not readily apparent or visible upon coming up to the hotel.  We did eventually find it, but the hotel parking is actually a 1\/2 mile walk through the miracle mile shops to get to a public parking garage.  One is free to use the valet, and the hotel claims it is free, but keep in mind, be prepared to tip.  Not only was parking hard to find, so was hotel registration.  It took us about 20 minutes to finally find the desk to check in.  We were about 4th in line, and there were at least 3 people working the check in counter... it took us 1\/2 hour to even get up to the desk.  Not sure why the lack of efficiency.

Stimulus overload.  Party and club atmosphere 24\/7 - how about a little down time, give my senses a rest.  I don't need club music every time I get in an elevator.

Smoking is still allowed in the hotels here, and let me tell you, as an ex smoker, I cannot stand the smell of an ash tray, much less smelling like an ash tray after I've walked through the casino.  what gets me is when I ask for a non-smoking room, and the floor is clearly marked non-smoking, there are still ashtrays in the hallways on that floor and it still smells like an ashtray.

For a ""4-star"" hotel, I have a hard time even giving Planet Hollywood ""1-star",2,1,0

Over the years we've stayed at IP, Bally's, TI, Excalibur and Luxor. None of them hold a candle to PH. 

First, its pretty central on the strip, and the best part is from your room to the strip isn't a 5 mile hike like it is at some hotels. Then there is the fact that there is an ABC store in the Miracle Mile shops to get beer, liquor and water cheap and close by. 

Then there is the fact that there are casual, fast places to fill your stomach when you wake up not feeling awesome (a Pink's chili dog will do wonders for a Vegas hangover).

The casino is mid-range, most table games are $15 and up at night, but some drop to $10 minimums during the day. The dealers are friendly and if you like the scantily clad type (makes losing money less painful) the pleasure pit features plenty of eye candy at night.

Great location- right in the middle of the strip across from the Bellagio dancing fountains, nice bathroom, nice lobby and mall, Britney spears and her show

Hotel needs some updating: carpets in the hallway were rolling up, pain in the butt self-parking. 

We ended up having to cart our luggage through out the whole mall, through the casino to end up at the front lobby. Not fun.

I kind of rolled my eyes when I heard the Aladdin had been turned into a Planet Hollywood, knowing that most of the restaurants had closed.  But the deal wasn't too bad to stay here compared to other similar places on the Strip, so here we stayed.

I was pleasantly surprised by the niceness of the employees and the look of the casino\/hotel lobby.  It's not cheesy like a PH restaurant, it's more hip\/posh club-like on the inside with flashy chandeliers and lights that change color (but not in an in-your-face kind of way).  They keep the black floors so shiny that you can possibly see up people's skirts (my boyfriend noticed this, of course). Heh.  I saw them polishing that floor time and time again.  The dealers are pretty friendly here overall, and occasionally you can catch a go-go dancer doing her thing in front of the tables.  The cocktail waitresses here definitely have some of the better (but sluttier) outfits.

We got a free upgrade to a Strip view (but if you wanted full view of the Bellagio fountains it was still $30 more).  I'm pretty sure most of the rooms are still Aladdin-themed because the woman who checked us in tried to get us a new one but none were available.  So the carpets and bedspreads still have that Ali-Babba thing going on, but it was mixed in with movie frames and memorabilia.  We had a 007 picture, a ""Hulk"" picture and a piece of framed memorabilia from one of those Jack Ryan movies.

Pros: Location. Right on the strip so easy access

Cons: 
Rooms - poorly lit and dingy feeling. Stayed in the Tarzan movie room. Horrendous, celebrates some cheesy version of the movie know one's ever heard of with Casper Van Diem and the only theme was that there was a picture in the bedroom and one in the bathroom and there was a table with a glass top that had his used loin cloth encased in it. 
The door of the dresser cabinet only held on by one hinge and fell off when trying to open it. The sheets were scratchy and pillow were terrible.
The shampoo that had been left in the bathroom was actually from the Paris Hotel\/Casino. No idea why the maids would put that out. 

Casino - Just has an old and tired feel to it. 

General - As I was checking out in the morning I needed to check emails prior to heading out I went down to the lobby assuming that they had free wifi there (as most hotels do). They don't but the gentleman behind the front desk kindly told me I could pay the wifi charge and have all day access (even though I had already told him I was on way out and had my bags in hand).

Food: Went to the Spice Market buffet on my first day there. All kinds of variety but the food was terrible. Almost everything tasted (and looked) like it had been sitting out all day. The only good part was the variety of desserts. This place bills themselves as award winning. Not sure who's giving out those awards?

I read thru the other reviews and don't really understand where the 4 and 5 star ratings come from. I was traveling with co-workers and everyone had something or another not very flattering to say about the place in general.

I understand that I'm young and that it's required to be in the casino, but she could have at least let me ask my question first and asked for my ID more politely. I wasn't even placing a bet yet. There was a much more tactful way to go about this. I also mistakenly gave her my MLife card, thinking Planet Hollywood was a MGM resort, and she kind of gave me an attitude when she told me it was a Total Rewards hotel.

We didn't realize he was missing until we got back to our room.  But instead of looking for him, we laughed about the situation and passed out (messed up i know, but we were drunk).  

Next thing we know, we get a knock on the door, and guess who it was?  Our missing drunk!  The staff at PH had found our friend walking around aimlessly in the casino with no shirt and no shoes completely inebriated.  They were nice enough to wheelchair him back to our room (free of charge).

I stayed here just recently and saw the difference between the old decor vs. the new and let me say THANK GOODNESS for the renovations!

If you're into the nightlife and love the whole celebrity\/Hollywood vibe scene, then I think you'll enjoy your stay at Planet Hollywood Casino & Resort. When arriving at this hotel, you might be a little confused on where to enter to get to the lobby.  I figured that all the hotel garages are right behind the hotel so it wasn't much of a problem for me to find it.  Be aware that you will have to enter through the Miracle Mile Mall from the parking garage to get to the casino\/lobby of PH.  

Check in is at 3PM and for my husband and I, it wasn't a problem at all.  We didn't even wait in line to check-in.  We had a complimentary room upgrade included in our suite package, but unfortunately they had no more available so we stuck with our resort suite located in the south tower.  Free champagne was also included, but we had so much fun that we forgot about it.  The room was really clean and fairly huge for 2 people alone. We had a view of the strip so I really have no complaints.  The HD tv is nice especially when you're watching the Playoffs! Who needs to leave the room when you have that luxury!?! 

The casino is pretty lively throughout the day\/night. There are go-go dancers dancing on platforms in the middle of all the tables and slot machines so it gives you some eye candy haha. Another thing I've noticed is that they have a plasma tv on everything you can think of so you're not missing a thing (especially when it comes to football). It's pretty roomy and with the mall being attached, you have a lot of choices on places to eat, drink, & lounge. My hubby and I spent a lot of time in this hotel.  We partied the night before at Palms and spent the rest at PH since it seems to have everything aside from free entertainment in the mall.

The one thing I would have to say that wasn't to my liking was the Spice Market Buffet.  I think it was overpriced for the quality of food that they serve.  It wasn't fresh nor was it #1 in my book.  I don't really know how they were voted #1 in 2007, but if I were you, I would eat inside the Miracle Mile Mall because their restaurants are good!!! If you eat inside the casino, expect to pay $10 for a mimosa! That was at Planet Dailies for any of you wondering. 

Aside from the buffet being on the downside, everything else is great in my book.  There are a variety of things to do in the hotel\/casino\/mall   if you take advantage of it and have the money to spend, so I'd have to say my husband and I were both pleased with our stay at PH.",0,0,1

Sadly no panoramic this time, but the front desk girl ended up upgrading my room from a comped Hollywood Hip King (standard lol) room to a Vista Room for a small tip!

The room itself was in the North Tower and super easy access to the casino floor. The bathroom was HUGE...2 separate sinks, oversized soaking tub, and standing shower. It was also nice having his and her closets too. The tub had a huge LCD over it and it gave a strip view where you can see Paris and the Bellagio fountains.

The living space was tiny though. The bed took up the majority of the room and usually there is a coffee table or small couch, it lacked those amenities. Bed was a little worn in and the North Tower was worn down in general lol

However, my biggest complaint had to be the ""Strip View"" they placed on the 12th floor and half the Strip view was the back of a building with lawn chairs and other pipes. so ASK FOR A HIGH FLOOR even if you booked a Strip View room. 

Again, 4 stars for this stay because I didn't pay for the room besides the $50 front desk tip and resort fees. Going rate for the room that weekend (Thurs to Mon) was about $150-$200 a night, so I got a good deal. Had I paid that price, I would have been disappointed though!

Overall, Planet Hollywood is my go to spot when I gamble.The casino isn't excessively large yet large enough. The casino floor has high energy, and it has a nice range of table limits. Again, I would avoid the standard rooms unless you're getting a comp, but location is top notch!

She had directed me to the elevators.

My room was located on the 16th floor.  The displayed floor plan is very easy to read.  Upon entering the room, you walk into into a spacious entry area.  To the right is the very spacious bathroom.  There's two sink\/ vanity areas, great soaking tub with a separate shower and a private toilet area.  Some people may think the double doors are a little strange, however, the doorway is wider than a normal doorway.

The bedroom area, to me, is large with two queen size beds, couple of lounging chairs, desk and a table with some movie memorabilia.  Great view.  Sure some of the furniture had couple of dings\/knicks in them.  Did it ruin my stay - No.  Everything was fine.

The housekeeping staff\/houseman are friendly.  They would acknowledge you as walking past them.  Please remember to tip them accordingly.  They have a hard job.  

As far as the casino..... typical casino.  Very well lit and fresh air.  Sure, people were smoking but due to the air system, you didn't smell the smoke.

Stayed here with about 10 other girls for MDW. Since I never stayed at PH before, I always liked them solely for having Earl's and Fat Tuesdays. After MDW, I now know that's all they're good for. In short, poor customer service and very unhelpful.

First off, we booked PH for a two bed room, but we ended up getting one king size bed. Annoying, but they did say they couldn't guarantee requests. Fine. On a quick random note, apparently all the rooms at PH have a different movie theme - ours was the Karate Kid.

Our first issue with PH was that their rooms have the shittiest lighting ever. This is NOT ideal for girls that have to get ready to go out clubbing. Not only is the lighting not bright enough, but they just didn't have any lamps in the room! Even the desk didn't have a lamp, which we thought was strange.

Our second night was a complete disaster. My friends and I were about ready to leave our room to go out clubbing when one of my friends informed us that the toilet was clogged and started to overflow, leaking onto the bathroom floor. We quickly called the front desk to notify them about the problem and they said they would fix it (this was around 9pm). We also made sure that it was okay that we were stepping out for the night and they assured us it was fine and they would fix it while we were out.

A friend and I ended up coming back early because she wasn't feeling well, so it was around 12:30-45 when we reached our floor and were walking to our room. As we got closer, we saw a cart outside of our room. A worker came out and said, ""Are you staying in here? Your toilet overflowed and started to leak to the floor below. We need to move all of your stuff to a new room."" What. The. Fuck. We went into our room and saw that the carpet was SOAKED with water that probably had remnants of pee, poo, and vomit. Since a lot of us had left our stuff on the floor, our bags and clothes were soaked, too. EWWW.

So, we had to move everything out and to our new room. Luckily, we had a bell hop help us, so that was nice of them since it was only 2 of us moving 10 girls-worth of luggage. When a few more of our friends came back, including the one whose credit card was under the room, she went down to go talk to the manager about the situation - making sure we didn't have to pay for the water damages. She came back up, pissed, telling us that the staff was very unhelpful and basically told her that they wouldn't do anything for us because they're already doing us a favor by not charging us for the damages. Well obviously we shouldn't be charged because it was not our fault. We did our duty as customers to inform them of a problem. Oh, I forgot to mention that when my friend and I first arrived at 12:45 that it looked as if they had just started to clean up the water, when we called them about it at 9pm. If they had tended to the problem immediately at 9pm, then there probably would only be water leakage on the bathroom tile floor, which is a million times easier to dry than carpet. Why they didn't tend to it sooner is beyond me, but regardless, we informed them so it is not our fault. Still,they would not do anything for us since clearly they see that they are doing something for us by not charging us for their fuck up.

This whole situation really showed us their lack of integrity and they must not care that we're telling all of our friends (and fellow Yelpers) not to stay there. Aside from our whole toilet situation, I still don't like this hotel for its poor lighting in the rooms and their house keeping is pretty shitty, too. We requested to have more towels and blankets the first night and all we got was one towel and a pile of bed sheets.

Thanks, PH.",12,4,3

Right on the strip, many of the popular hotels and eating areas are located within walking distance.  And my favorite store Urban Outfitters is right downstairs in the Miracle Mile Shops.  So if you're looking for convenience, location, and price, Planet Hollywood is a great place to stay....if you don't care about lavish amenities.  When I booked the hotel, it averaged around $80-$115 a night.  Very reasonable for a strip hotel.

Yet...this hotel comes with crappy old movie memorabilia inside your hotel room.  We had some obscure 1995 Cindy Crawford movie poster hanging in the bathroom, an entire costume\/outfit from the movie glued to the freaking wall (taking up an entire wall space where a window could have gone), and a Cindy Crawford book permanently implanted inside a table.  Not the most classy hotel room decor.  The windows (or should I say window, as in ONE) were too small, which was unfortunate because it had a great view of the Bellagio Fountain.  You also could hear the water running very loudly in the adjacent hotel rooms.  It actually sounded like Niagara Falls was in the next room over.  They need to work on sound-proofing the rooms because we could hear youngins clubbing it up down below.  Not pleasant when you're too old for that shit and you want a good night's sleep.

There was only one sink, but a separate shower and tub, which is always nice.  Two sinks would have been nicer though, because sharing sinks with the hubby isn't fun.

Make sure you head to the valet entrance since it's free in Vegas.  All you have to pay is the tip!  So, valet and let those nice bell boys help you out with your bags.

As we were coming to Vegas for a bachelorette party, and we are the bridesmaids, we had packed the car to the brim with enough gift bags, booze, snacks, decorations, and suitcases for the weekend.  Our bellhop was amazing and helped grab every little flowery gift bag (there were 22 of them) and wheeled all our stuff to our rooms.

This was the first time I stayed at the Planet Hollywood, but since the remodeling and transformation from the Aladdin, I expected it to be pretty nice.  We had four different rooms, so I went and peeked into each one just to check it out.  I loved that every room had a different movie theme, our's was Lost in Space.  There were some random movie posters on the wall and memorabilia scattered throughout the room.

The restroom area has a huge vanity counter and mirrror, a large jet jacuzzi tub, shower, and toilet.  The layout was much nicer than most other hotels, and was incredibly spacious.  Since we had 4 girls to a room, space was definitely a necessity.

Some of the girls became a little frantic when their room keys didn't work as a result of them placing the cards next to cellphones and credit cards.  We went downstairs and the guy at the front desk got us two keys very quickly.

I love that the hotel is connected to the Miracle Mile shops.  There are so many different stores and restaurants to keep a shopaholic busy for days.  It's also convenient to not have to leave your hotel to go buy some last minute accessories for your outfit or grab a quick smoothie from Jamba Juice.

The Planet Hollywood is also in the middle of the strip which makes it super convenient to get from one hotel to another.  Although, we went when it was over 100 degrees every day, so we took taxi cabs instead.

If you join their players club they will give you rewards based on your play. My family has received hotel comps including free nights and free buffet! What I like about the Planet Hollywood is the convenient location in the middle of the strip and the proximity of the Miracle Mile right below the hotel. If you need groceries or toiletries you can pop down to the ABC store and there are two located right downstairs! Not to mention a huge variety of stores and restaurants to choose from! I also like Planet Hollywood because each room has a movie theme including movie posters and film memorabilia. The beds are always soft with clean linens and the bathrooms are huge!! If you ask you can get a room with a view of the Bellagio water fountains :). I also have to say that the hotel staff are incredible. One year my mom got sick and they went above and beyond by sending their staff to escort her to the nearest clinic. Every time I come back to the Planet Hollywood I feel perfectly at home.",2,0,0

The walls are scuffed and could use a paint job. The casino gaming area is its best attraction. Female go go dancers were dancing on the gaming tables the night we arrived. A live band played nice music. Gordon Ramsey's Burgr is located inside of the hotel. The wait was over an hour long and the food was actually mediocre. I expected more from his restaurant because he is a well respected chef and food critic. I love  Gordon but his burger was not worth the 30 dollars that I paid for it. They had several other great places to dine and drink in the hotel which was awesome. Two thumbs up if you get a cheap rate on Expedia.,0,0,0

We chose the hotel just to get a feel of it, it's in the center of strip so I thought the location was perfect. But the hotel is really old and the room carpets you could tell had been there for quite a while because it looks dirty.

We stayed at the 33rd which is a smoking room and it literally smells like smoke once you walk in.

No microwave, no fridge, the toilet flush was defective and the room was really really dark. The casino downstairs is alright as well as the restaurants in the hotel main floor but the room sucks, as hell. Would never stay at this hotel again even if it's half the price.

Bathrooms had soap film all over the counters,the rugs were never vacuumed when we left for housekeeping to do there their thing, tables and desk were never wiped down honestly it was so awful it was like a bad joke.

However, the number of guests had a huge increase come Thursday, which is usually when the weekend rush hits. The hotel features beautiful decor, a great buffet (which happened to be voted Best in Vegas last year), and I couldn't help walking around the Miracle Mile Shops nearly everyday. We took advantage of the valet parking, which is almost a must if you want to stay out of the sweltering 3 digit heat. At times, the service was a little slow, but the staff was prompt and curteous. They even gave us bottled water while we were waiting for our car. We were also lucky to have a room with a view of the entire Bellagio fountain and the hotel's pool area. Only downside? The housekeeping staff could've been a bit more friendly. My dad was a little irked that they didn't really greet us as we would walk by.

They provide no shampoo or conditioner, and their shower gel does not lather. I was glad that I tend to be compulsive and bring my own grooming supplies.

I scored a great deal off Expedia for a two-night stay and everything from the booking, check-in, and check-out was a smooth process. The staff was super courteous in taking care of us, the housekeepers were always happy and greeted us in the hallways, and the front desk was even kind enough to accommodate an early check-in and automatic check-out coordinated for us too! 

We had a hip room with a view of the back side of the hotel with the theme of Les Miserables movie memorabilia showcased around the room. Very spacious, clean, and comfortable space. Our king size bed was very comfy, although my pillows were a bit stiff for my taste. We had both a bathtub and a shower in our room, with enough towels to last us our stay. Large screen t.v and armoire, however our armoire in our room had a broken door hinge. Nonetheless, I loved our room. 

If shopping is your thing PH is home to the Miracle Mile shops, which boast shopping outlets and restaurants for all tastes, desires and budgets. The hotel's location is quite convenient as well. Situated near many of the other well-known hotels, such as Bally's, Paris, The Cosmopolitan, and the Bellagio- it makes explore during the day a breeze and not too far of a walk either. 

PH's casino caters to the younger crowd with their hip and cool layout and music ambiance. Even taking a ride in the elevator felt like a party from the music they kept booming overhead. Many good places to eat at this hotel. I recommend Earl of Sandwich as a great on-the-go, budget friendly yet delicious stop to curb your hunger cravings. 

If you're in the mood for taking in a spa day, I recommend making an in-person reservation at the Mandara Spa on the Mezzanine level. The services and pricing are pretty much the same as most hotels in the area, but for me it was the convenience and saved me time, and I had a great massage as well so...no regrets :) I would definitely stay here again next Vegas trip.",6,1,1

We were upgraded to the suite, which in hindsight appears to be a bad decision because the suite size while larger was filled with many crazy angled areas that were not suitable for walking through.  

A rounded toilet room had a huge space that had nothing occupying it.  Strange right?  Maybe I can put stadium seating in that space so people can cheer you on while you do your business?  There is a tub AND shower in the bathroom as well, which is nice.  The biggest waste of space was the office.  It was there for me to do business or homework I imagine?  I don't care if not doing my homework at vegas will cause me to flunk out...I will not do homework at vegas.  I think you get kicked out of the city if you do homework there.  So....what is the point of the office?

Also, the casino is so dark it feels like the manager is trying to save money on the electric bill.  Also, the water pressure is low in this place.  I think when you flush or turn on water a guy has to spit in the pipes to get things going.  It is as though gravity does not exist in the hotel and water must fight to make its way through the pipes.  Come on water!  You can do it!  Hey....maybe that is what the stadium seating is for in the bathroom....a cheering section for the water pressure.

So...in conclusion:
1) Crappy decorating (definitely not Hollywood although it had a piece of paper framed on the wall supposedly from some movie I never heard of)
2) Wasted space....an office you will never use and stadium seating in the bathroom you shouldn't use.
3) Priced way too high for the little you receive

My recommendations:
1) Clean Room?
2) Nice to look at Room?
3) Cheap Room?
4) Located in the heart of the strip?

Then choose the Flamingo.  IF you want a room that has the four items listed above and a great view of the fountains...but maybe a bit nicer...then choose Paris.  DO NOT choose Planet Hollywood.",1,1,0

The service left quite a bit to be desired though. Day 1, no in room refrigerator and when I went to the ice machine on our floor, it was out of ice. I called the front desk to see if someone could bring up a bucket of ice. The reply? ""Well, they will charge you because you could just take the elevator to another floor."" Maybe I've just been here too long and take customer service for granted but that seems just crazy to me. 

Day 2, we woke up (a little rough around the edges) and started to look around for a coffee maker....none? Wow! We call the front desk and get a similar response, basically ""no."" Even a Holiday Inn comes with a coffee maker, sheesh. We look up room service for coffee, $9.00 for half a pot, not out of the ordinary for room service. They bring the coffee and it's $17.00. There is a 19% service fee and a $5.00 per order fee. I'm all about charging what you can but the actual cost should be more prominent than a 3 point font at the bottom of the page.

Any decent player can make a killing here if they just sit tight. The dealers are average or above average. They also have a high hand jackpot with a progressive for royal flushes. Four of a kind pays 100 as long as you table it and straight flushes pay 250.  
    As for the rest of the casino, I really like the atmosphere. Young, loud, and with great eye candy everywhere. The buffet isn't bad and the Earl of Sandwich is awesome for late night eats. I'm a big fan of this casino overall and I'd say I spend more time here then any other casino.",1,0,0

She flew from Virginia and it was her first time to Vegas, so I recommended PH to stay based on previous experience. 

Initially we pull into valet and no one even walked up to us. My friend had to get out of the car to walk up to the desk (where several customer service reps were standing) and was told we needed to drive back around (even though the first gentleman we saw pointed us towards this desk), but okay, we drove back around and finally got parked. 

Then, the first room we went into looked like a dump - the vents were dusty, there were stains on the couch and toilet, and scratches all over the walls\/furniture. We went downstairs to explain to the customer service desk and the response we received was, ""so what are you asking for?""... The woman was rude and acted as if we were bothering her. She ended up changing us to a second room which was in the same condition as the first. I don't expect the rooms to be perfect, but stained furniture, unclean showers and dirty linens? We go back downstairs, this time into the Diamond guest line and received much better customer service. Finally, third time a charm, we got an acceptable room and were able to settle in. 

It took us over 2 hours to get checked in and settled into a clean room. It certainly wasn't the greatest first impression for my friend and really changed my view on PH. I like PH's casino the best but moving forward I'll more than likely be staying at a different hotel.

I recently stayed here for my very first time since PH took over the old Aladdin Hotel, and I must say the renovations are simply off the hook! The first changes I noticed was walking through the new Miracle Mile Shopping Mall. Although the shops and restaurants remain relatively similar from the old Aladdin Hotel days, some of the wall repaints gave it new life comparable to the feel of the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace...

Upon entering the casino area, I was very impressed with how posh and modern this place has become with a mixture of futuristic and retro furnishings and decor, bright colors, and light fixtures. The music they pump out at the casino is loud and oozes out a party atmosphere off the bat! The overall layout of the place is very easy to navigate around, so no problems getting lost in here. In the heart of the casino is the Heart Bar, which I will also review later... The slots and tables are all brand spanking new...which leads to my favorite area of the casino, the gaming area where the dealers are all hot chicks in lingerie and go-go dancers all around! Very dangerous place to get distracted and lose all your money at, but man these girls just wanna make you fall in lust over and over again. 

So from the casino, the service desk is a short escalator ride down one floor where checking in is a breeze. The employees are very friendly and accomodating. I happen to get a really cute Filipina chick to help me out, and a little flirting does go a long way...my room was upgraded to a suite! Amazing what a smile and making her laugh will do. So off to the room I went and I must say the rooms here are very nice. Everything smells brand new and plush. 42"" plasma screen, hot tub, and the most comfortable hotel bed I've been on! *sigh*

This is definitely NOT your grandparents' or parents' typical Las Vegas hotel....The crowd here is young, beautiful, and hip! Everything here is just so gaddamn cool! The HOT women that stay and party here are just unfrikkenbelievable! Again I was falling in lust left and right...No wonder they chose this spot to film the movie ""21"" at.

Booked the room back in February 2013 for this trip, 25 AUG to 28 AUG, for a mini bachelor party.  I was comped for three nights\/four days, and the resort had waived all resort fees and taxes.  I was sure skeptical of staying at the pH b\/c I've read so many negative reviews on TripAdvisor, but to my surprise, I was actually impressed with everything.

Check-In

After a delayed three hour arrival flight from Los Angeles, the driver picked me up at McCarran, and took me directly to the pH circular drop off area.  The personnel opened up the doors, and led the way to the front desk area.

Although there was a slight 10 minute wait at check-in, it wasn't too bad at all.  When my turn came up for check-in, the young man took my passport and confirmation number, and since I declined to pay incidental charges, I was lucky not provide any credit card info.  I did confirm with the front desk agent that everything was comped, and since he did a great job at his service, I tipped the guy $20, and I received, not only an upgrade to their resort strip view room, but also a free rollaway bed for three nights (usually $30\/night).  When it comes to service, they are right on--they meet my standards 

The Room

So the access from the lobby to the elevators\/room wasn't bad at all.  Took the north tower elevator to the eighteenth floor, and was given to my surprise, a large resort view room.  Although the room didn't have the 180 strip view room, which I wasn't expecting at all, it had a wonderful view of pool plus the Aria\/strip view.  The location of the room was just perfect--three doors away from the corner of the elevator area, with very little floor hall noise to hear.

When you walk into the room, you'll notice a large bathroom with dual vanities (one on each side) with a toilet area that separates by a door, from the bathroom area.  I love this--shower is separated from the tub.  

The room itself is a bit oddly shaped--the television is set in the middle where the beds aren't directly in front, but on its side.  The two love seats are in front with a large themed table in front, with the two large sized windows.  

OK, so I see a lot of people being so freaken meticulous about the wear and tear of the furniture.  OK, so there's a little wear-and-tear, but really, when you're in Vegas with a bunch of guys for a bachelor party, you're there to crash and sober up for the next day, with of course showering\/cleaning up, and getting a good night's rest.  I didn't really notice those things, and if you all had bad experiences in the past, good for you.

To me, the beds were ridiculously comfortable--didn't want to wake up in the morning.  The beds are quite large--could it possibly be two kings instead of two queens? I don't know but for whatever reason, they were sure comfortable to me.

The one thing I noticed was that there was no armoire.  They had a small closet to hang up your jackets, pants, dressy stuff, but not an armoire to store those folded polos and jeans--a little odd.

Really, you all think the rooms were dark, because to me, they weren't dark at all.  They were actually really bright, and I loved how all the sunlight came thru.  

Casino

The casino is actually pretty fun inside.   Although it's quite easy to get lost in it, I like the vibe of the casino--it presents a very young-crowd atmosphere.  My favorite has definitely got to be the Pleasure Pit--really good looking girls dancing with hot and attractive card dealers--don't mind staring at them all day.

Eateries\/Restaurants\/Buffets

Although my friends and I did not dine at the more upscale restaurants on site i.e.: Gordon Ramsey's BurGr, or one of the other fancier restaurants, we did dine at the buffet for the all-you-can-eat King Crab dinner.  The price is fair, at around $35, for all you can eat, but here's a definite suggestion: if you go to the buffet, go before 6PM or after 8:30PM, because we attempted to go the first night we arrived at around 6:30PM, and there was no way we were going to be waiting in line for a half hour.  The food's pretty good--not the best I've had, but definitely not bad at all.  Service was a little lousy, however you can't expect the best these days.  The quality of the food was above average, but not excellent.  For example, I got a plate of pasta, and usually, pasta's pretty good wherever you go--a staple item, however the one bite I took of the linguini wasn't edible, and I just couldn't finish it at all.  The crab legs were very good, and it was a bargain for what we paid.  All in all, buffet passes my test.

Not only was the room great, the pool was perfect, the buffett was delicious, the 24 hour Planet Dailies was convinent, the slots grabbed my attention, plenty of shopping at the Miracle Mile which was connected to Planet Hollywood.  The hotel is right in the center of the strip, so you can go anywhere you'd like, but since this hotel had practically everything affordable in it, we stayed within the vicinity most of the time.

The last time I stayed at this hotel, prior to my recent visit, was when they were transitioning this hotel from Aladdin to Planet Hollywood.  They had ""Planet Ho"" on the building since they were putting up the sign.  Sorry...I just had to mention that.

The rooms pretty much seem exactly the same and I think need a little updating.  I'm glad to see that they got rid of the magic lamp carpets.  However, the hotel rooms just seem dated.

The casino is nice and offers plenty of great tables and slots.  There are also plenty of places to pick for food and I'm a big fan of the shopping right there.

I'm giving this place 4 stars for the location, the shopping, and food places.  If you're looking for a bomb-diggity hotel room...you might want to look elsewhere.",1,2,0

We liked the location of the Bellagio so we decided to stay at  Planet Hollywood.  About the only good thing I can say about Planet Hollywood is the location is good and the bathrooms are nice.  There was a long line to check in, the rooms were ok but the placement of the tv was awful- you have to turn your neck sideways from the bed to see the tv (and this was in an upgraded room), there is no closet space and only 2 small drawers.  The view was great- looking out over the strip and the Eiffel tower.  The customer service at this hotel is sadly lacking- the valets were rude, the housekeeping department was terrible and the general staff in the hotel had a very uncaring attitude.  Forget an afternoon nap- housekeeping did not come to do our rooms until after 3:00 pm on most days.  The valet was a nightmare- 2 nights when we got back to the hotel, the valet was full!  We had to park all the way on the other side of the hotel and trek through Miracle Mile Mall.  When asking our valet about this- he stated there are only 500 valet spots and that they cannot reserve them for hotel guests.  So if you want to valet your car, get back to the hotel before 8:30 pm.  The restaurants in the hotel were overpriced.  The best part of the hotel is the bathtubs and the location.  

My husband tried to use the gym only to be told it was $25.00 a DAY to use it!  I was shocked.  Then there is the $15.00 per day for Wi-Fi and if you want to print out your boarding passes- be prepared to spend alot!  There are no resort fees here, just a fee for everything that should be included!    We will not be returning to this hotel.

When PH was Aladdin, the hotel was actually quite nice... Then again, I stayed there when it first opened at the time. Even though I was much younger, I remember the smell of newness and the kick @$$ view of the Bellagio fountain.
I recently stayed here for a bacholorette party and both of our rooms had some issues (i.e. the blinds were not working properly, hallway lights not working). Although the staff was quick to remedy the problems, it just wasn't something we wanted to deal with on a relaxing weekend away. I will say that the beds were very comfy though! It also didn't help that we came during one of the worst weekends (MayPac).
The place has aged, no doubt. The clubs have changed. It's also a bit of a confusing layout. I bumped into multiple people who were trying to figure out how to get to their final destination. The gym on the other hand was clean and nice!

In fact I walked through the the Aladdin last year on the way to Krave, the only ""alternative club"" on the strip.  It's Vegas 2007 where ""alternative"" is still the code word for gay.  I digress...

The rooms are rather well appointed and according to a colleague better than the rooms at Paris Las Vegas.  I found my room to be rather dark and within an earshot of the strip and everything on it.

Plant Hollywood seems to have done a rather half assed job of upgrading the hotel.  I mean the lounge, building, elevators have a decidedly ""we're trying to compete with Hard Rock Hotel"" statement to them but the conference rooms from their art, architecture and even music suggest that they haven't done one damn different thing there then when it was the Aladdin.  

On the same floor billed ""The Mezz"" as in they are now to cool to call it the Mezzanine, they have their fitness center hidden in their spa.  You don't have to pay to use it but it is only open from 6 am until 7 pm.  It would be helpful if registration and floor staff knew this before insisting it was open at 5 am when I was looking for it in vain.

The business center charges some heady surcharges and the bikini clad girls in the Heart lounge of the Hotel's center move with the energy of Britney Spears opening the VMAs wearing a nearly identical outfit.

Thankfully the room service is hooked up to PF Changs which allows for some unique and affordable dining service.

I have to say, I am sure they have to make money and all but please big billion dollar hotels, close down and upgrade the whole place at once.

Want to know why?
-It used to be the Aladdin, and the remodel was done rather half-assedly, you can still see middle eastern\/arabesque motifs all throughout the casino and mall.(Hell, the buffet is even still named the Spice Market. Sounds more like something you'd find in Morocco rather than Hollywood)
-If MTV was a building you can go to, this would be it(more so than even The Palms and Hard Rock).
-They're desperately trying to make you feel like you're in South Cali with Pink's Hot Dogs, a mall called the Miracle Mile, the EXTRA lounge(which is named after a celebrity news show which isn't much better than a tabloid), etc....

It tries so, so hard. And it fails. The Miracle Mile is definitely an improvement from what it was originally like so that's a plus. I still want to try the Spice Market Buffet but I've heard way too many stories about long toilet trips resulting from someone eating a Pink's hot dog and every other restaurant just seems overpriced or overhyped.

Housekeeping is a joke! The bathroom counter was covered with a sticky substance.  The sink fixtures were corroded, and the one of the sinks backed up (thankfully there are 2).

This isn't a magical hotel or a luxurious stay or one of those hi-end suites with a retractable screen shade, but this vegas hotel is the best in overall experience.

I've booked this stay for my wife's b-day weekend and this was 1st of 2 hotel stays on the strip. I""ll tell you what if you can get a good price for a stay here, you more than maximized your buck!

Our room was clean and comfy. Nice dresser and comfortable beds. I've mentioned earlier that this hotel is hip, it is! It is not a typical run down hotel nor outdated. My room had a Nascar shrine of someone, not sure which professional driver it was but I had a Nascar display. I had to order a mini-fridge to my room to keep cool my wife's gift from Payard Patisserie and Bistro and i'm glad they were able to do so.

Getting through check-in is weird here, if i'm coming from the rear parking lot, I would walk with my baggage on-hand and cutting off part of the Miracle Mile shops, so shoppers downstairs would see me a traveller in distress to get a room Lol, but hey it's all good who cares it's only Vegas.

The casino is awesome esp when ur arriving late and coming from a long drive from LA after an 9hr workday and too famished to go clubbing.  The casino itself is a big club and on top of that, decor looks great with all the colors.

The walk from the self parking lot to the front registration is a plain nightmare, lugging your luggage thru the long mall after a 5 hr drive sucks.  ESP when you just want to arrive, check-in and get ur nite started already.

The hotel hallways are a bit dingy.  While the bed i find pretty comfortable, the rest of the room is not up to par.  The furniture is scratched up and old.  The closet doesn't even fit a large suitcase.  Low standard bathroom.  Shower head is cheap and so filled with soap scum that you are getting scattered sprays.  And don't even get me started on the complimentary toiletries - The shower gel smells cheap and doesn't lather, the lotion smells cheap.  Good thing i bring all those things with me normally so i don't even need to go near theirs.  

While i can put up with all this (minus the shower head) it would be very nice if they did a little upgrading.  I know they can afford it, esp with thier room prices and how much traffic goes on in thier casino.

PH's marketing \/ PR dept must be geniuses because they have created a demand (and high prices) for something that should warrant no such demand.

1) check in is horrific (I am talking an hour plus wait in line), the lady who helped me said this is typical.  I am convinced they are doing this on purpose to instill in guests and passers by that PH is THE place to be. They have an online ""express check in"", which I am glad I did because I got to skip the massive line and go straight to the much shorter ""key pick up line"". But then we still had to do all the usual check in tasks so I am not sure what the point of the online express check in is? 

2) the casino and hotel lobby may be sleek and updated, but the minute you step into the hotel elevator you will notice heavy wear and tear. The elevator doors were banged up and dingy. The hallways have marks all over the walls and look completely worn.

3) the rooms are old Aladdin rooms with some added ugly wallpaper, paint and banged up furniture. Our room felt like a cave. It's only redeeming quality was the view of Paris and the Bellagio fountains (the window was really small though). The bed was obviously well used and uncomfortable.

4) we could hear EVERY. SINGLE. FLIGHT. going over us all night long (maybe our small window wasn't very sound proofed? Or maybe they didn't build the Aladdin to block out outside noise?).i have never experienced this level of sound at any other strip hotels

5) parking is literally a mile away ( you have to walk the length of the mall to get to it)

The most annoying part about our stay at the Aladdin, I mean Planet Hollywood, was knowing that people were paying in the upper $200s for this nastiness. You are paying MGM Grand prices for Monte Carlo \/ Bally's quality. As long as people are paying these ridiculous prices for such poor quality, PH will continue to charge them.

On a brighter note I actually really like the hotel casino. It's pretty nice and clean. Love that it doesn't smell like heavy cigarettes. Love all the lights and the colors they used to decorate, really pretty. I also love how PH is in the middle of the strip we were able to cross and go to the Cosmo.

There are so many better hotels that care about their guests and by far this is not one of them. I normally write long long reviews but I want the public to actually read this so I'll keep to the detais: 

We stayed for over a week on an extended vacation and in the first 2 days:
 - Horrible front desk - checkin they ""prepaid"" my credit card for the ENTIRE stay instead of just taking a deposit... which is fine but it screwed us the rest of the trip because we couldn't charge anything to the room because technically there was no ""credit card"" on file. And wasn't given the option - they just did it. Later we found out by the manager ""oops - we shouldn't have done that... was it debit card? ... and the answer was NO and no one ever asked
 - We tipped the frontdesk to get a nice room with a view but it was dirty and could tell it has been ""used"" with stains many times
 - Door handle was broken at 3am when we came home... couldn't get in
 - Took forever to get a guy to come and fix it... sat on the floor for ages waiting for them to fix it when they did show up... no accomodations for inconvenience
 - Handyman DID NOT log that he fixed it...
 - 18 hours later... Wife is in the bathroom undresssed and hears loud banging on the door like a drunk idiot trying to breakin to his own room... ignore it (hopefully they'll go away) ... they do it again... ignored... suddenly DOOR OPENS! 
 - Wife freaks out and thinks someone is breaking in and has a key to her room and she's naked on the toilet in the bathroom! 
 - Turns out it was maintainence, didn't annouce himself until he walked in... person from 3am did NOT log in that he fixed the lock (where would we be for the last 18 hours if it wasn't fixed??) 
 - Manager was rude nice... as in nice in tone but rude in conversation. Basically pawned everything off as ""that's the engineering department, i don't control their actions"" and ""the maintainence guy was following policy"" and ""you're welcome to leave with a refund and no fee if you want"" ... 


Dont't waste your time here. It's not about customer service - you can tell they're trained to be heartless, be fake sympathetic and offer no solutions in return but say ""I understand what happened. Thanks for letting us know"". 

It's ruined the rest of the trip and my wife doesn't feel safe in this hotel or our room. 

If you intend to waste your money and spend ZERO time in your room - then you're fine here. If you actually want a hotel experience from your hotel - DO NOT STAY HERE.

Even if it's a mini fridge. Most hotel rooms come with a fridge but this wasn't the case. We had brought a cooler of liquor, snacks, food and water\/coconut water and were planning on using a fridge but instead we filled our bathtub with ice and that was sufficient for 2 nights 3 days. If you're driving to Vegas, lug a cooler of liquor and food over. You'll save money with food and pregaming before you go out.

The bathroom is huge, it's like 80% the size of the bedroom, which didn't make sense considering they should have invested some of the space for a fridge. But it ended up making sense when 5 girls were getting ready, putting on makeup and doing our hair all at the same time. That wouldn't have been possible in a smaller bathroom. 
The door to the shower is crystal clear glass, which aesthetically looks nice but it's not really efficient when someone wants to shower and someone else wants to use the sink\/mirror\/toilet. We ended up putting a towel over the glass door so that the person showering is hidden from anyone using the sink and toilet. 
The socket would work only with one thing plugged in, which sucked because that meant only one person blow drying their hair, curling their hair, or straightening their hair at a time. We had to allot time for each person to do her hair when we could have had 2 people doing their hair at the same time.

Parking garage is not connected to the hotel portion so unless you get valet at the front desk, you'd have to roll your luggage through the shopping center and casino to get to your room.

Planet Hollywood is in the middle of the strip with a Fat Tuesday located in the shopping center and an open 24\/7 Earl of Sandwich in the casino. Knocking out iconic things to do all just by staying at Planet Hollywood. They have a buffet but I didn't go there let alone see it while I was staying there.

I've read about people complaining on the cleanliness. I thought it was average, not too clean and not too dirty but I'm comparing it to a scale of frat house dirty to spa clean. There were some tiny stains in places if you looked hard enough but it wasn't disgusting as some other people wrote that it was. Maybe I'm part of the other half of the customers that contribute to the dirtiness of the hotel instead of complaining about it. I remember spilling some cheesy mac and cheese (from Earl of Sandwich) and maybe some liquor too on the carpet in the hallway. Sorry.

At first I told myself ""how bad could it be?"", but it all started at the front desk when the man checking me in spoke to me with such attitude and insisted that I pay an extra $50 a night for a better room with a view and more space. After a couple minutes he finally convinced me and sent me up with my room keys. When I got to my room there were a couple things wrong: 
1) my view was of the roof of the building next door- totally opposite of the strip! 
2) the room was absolutely tiny and was in no way an upgrade. 
3) the bathroom had hair in the sink
4) the showers seemed moldy and dirty on the corners 

So what did I do? I called the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. 
They connected me to the manager named VICKY. I explained to her my issues and how unhappy I was and once again I receive attitude from another employee of planet hollywood. After a couple minutes of complaint, she agreed to switch me to a bigger and better room. She told me to go to the 23rd floor and a bellman will be there right away. I immediatly went up to the room she designated for me and waited TWENTY FIVE MINUTES outside the door until the bellman came with my keys and luggage. Now that's not the worst part. The worst part is that the room was the SAME thing. Same size and all. Nothing better. But by then I was exhausted and told myself to just accept it and move on. Later that night I can back to my room expecting to see my room cleaned because that's what housekeeping usually does. Expect I entered my room and was surprised to see that housekeeping cleaned only ONE OF THE BEDS!! My bed was still a mess. I called the front desk and told them my issue and all the lady tells me is ""let me connect you to housekeeping"". I waited 5 min until I gave up on housekeeping answering the phone. Now ontop of all that, I decided to take a shower and the water was WARM, not hot, WARMMM. who the hell wants to take a warm shower at night?????
The next day I go to valet to get my car. I wait 15 min until my car comes. Then I tip the valet guy 3 dollars and he looks and me and says ""that's all?"" --I thought that was one of the most disgusting things ever. Upon checkout, I insisted in speaking to VICKY (the manager). They told me she isn't available and that she will call me back asap. It has been a week and I still haven't received a phone call from VICKY or anyone at planet hollywood customer service. 

OVERALL, my experience at planet hollywood was HORRIBLE and I promise you that I will NEVER go back there even if I have to sleep in a hotel bathroom stall. I absolutely DO NOT reccomend this hotel.

The casino is decent, but definitely not my favorite. As a poker player, I find their Poker Room too open, with too much noise.

Valet is a must! So easy and friendly staff.

I would have given it 4 stars but we got there a little earlier than expected and asked for an early check in about 6:30 am. The clerk told us that if I checked in now I would be charged for a whole night stay and to come back at 9, I found him to be VERY rude. So we walked around the hotel but realized we were just too exhausted. We waited for an hour in the lobby and saw people going up to what looked like a check in, but we decided to still wait. 8 came around and my boyfriend was asleep on my lap so decided I couldn't wait any longer and I went up asked another lady if we can check and and she checked us in with ease, for a fee, which was fine with me. She also said early check in starts at 6.... UGH! Checkout line was VERY long just for them to say, ""okay you're good.""

The room was great, Adams Family theme, HUGE bed and very comfy. Plenty of space to hang your clothes and drawers to fold other clothes. The bathroom had its own private bathroom, which I loved and separate tub and shower. We were close to the elevator and the room was very quiet and dark. 

The pool was cool 21 and up, its not a pool party like other resorts but it's still fun if you're a little too hungover to catch a cab and go to a pool party. I did see a couple girls flash their boobs and then get kicked out, very funny. 

The resort has a mall connected to it and you can get very lost! But it has all your needs while staying cool.

Not super expensive, yet not a tacky vegas hotel, right across the street from the bellagio and cosmopolitan, right next to Paris LV, great and lively casino, SO close to the mall, and a lot of great places to eat easily within walking distance.

The rooms are a little small, but the bathroom makes up for it.  I wish I took pictures....the bathtub in of itself made the stay so amazing. I would take a soak after I turned in for the night, and the rain shower was great too.  The bathroom had a must for me: a water closet for privacy even if someone else wants to use the shower\/bath\/sink\/whatever.  The mirror in the bathroom has that great backlit frame, so perfect for putting on makeup.  Plenty of room to put all of your stuff, too.

Ask for a strip view, otherwise you'll have a view of some weird dome thing.  

The pool was also a pretty good scene, and no cover if you are a guest of the hotel.  Good DJ. 

The room service menu was SUPERB...I had a life-changing grilled cheese with pulled pork and mac and cheese.  Even PF Changs, which is in the casino, will deliver to your room!

The only criticism I have is that...they didn't have shave kits.  I forgot my razor and even the holiday inn has shave kits, but I had to go to Walgreens to get a razor.  Found that odd for a nice Las Vegas hotel.

We had a confirmed reservation for a room with two queen beds.  When we arrived to check in, admittedly a little late in the day on a Friday, they had no such rooms and placed us in a room with one king bed and brought up a roll-away.  The promised to move us to a room with two queen beds the following day.

When we went to registration the following day, admittedly late in the day, we were told the only room with two queen beds available was a smoking room.  After asking to be placed in another property, if necessary, a non-smoking room with two queen beds was located on the property.  

At this price point, the rooms are good sized, especially the bathroom.  However, some of the beds are beat.  When I stayed here in January, my bed was beat.  The bed in the first room we had on this trip was beat, too.  To be fair, my bed in the second room was fine.  

The hallways look a little run down and dated. To me, they look dark and dingy, and the AC in the hallways could be improved in places.  

Check out was slow.  The express check on the TV did not work the last time we stayed here, and it didn't work this time, either.  To me, there is no excuse to have customers cued up in a long line to check out if you don't have the registration desk fully staffed.  People have planes to catch and what not, and a long check out doesn't help.  

Parking is a drag here, no other way to say it.  The structure is not huge, and on a busy weekend, it takes time to find a place to park.  Once you park, you have to hike the ""miracle mile"" through the ""Miracle Mile"" shopping mall to get from the parking structure to the casino and hotel.  It's not the worst thing in the world, but I can make it painful to leave the property if you want to use your own wheels to go places during a stay.",2,0,0

I was on a golf trip this week with 64 guys. 3 of us who were in TOTALLY different parts of the hotel had our rooms broken into WHILE WE WERE SLEEPING! Clearly they have an epidemic on their hands. All of our money was stolen and one guys Rolex watch. They used a master key. I still have not heard from the hotel security in regards to what they plan to do (I filed a report with security of course and followed up later). This was obviously an inside job since they were able to enter my room and I had both keys in my possession. Super scary. DO NOT STAY HERE.

I hate to compare one hotel to another, but our stay at Paris last year was so effortless. Planet Hollywood was just okay. I'm not sure if we'd go back.

Parking: Took FOREVER. Seriously we drove around the parking garage for over an hour. The entire second floor of the garage was empty, but roped off. The valet was full. We ended up stalking a couple to their car and waited for them to load up and pull out of the space while a line of cars waited behind us. I'm sorry to all the enemies we formed in the garage that day. Last year we were in Vegas during EDC weekend and still had no issue driving in and parking at Paris.

Check in: We did it this by phone\/email the morning of and only had to pick up keys. Pretty easy.

Room: Dated but cool. We had Shawshank Redemption memorabilia on the walls and paid for a strip view. I think paying for the view was worth it, we could watch the 'surfers' and at nigh the city lights were gorgeous. Room had no mini fridge or microwave. We had a non smoking room but the hallways smelt like cigarettes and our room reeked every time we opened the door.

Pool: Thumbs down. No where to sit - people were all over the edge and the lounge chairs were down a flight steps by the cafe. You could not comfortably leave your pool bag and go hang out in the water, it would be out of sight and 60 feet away. Again, hate to compare, but Paris has way more seating around the pool edge and there are easily chairs for everyone. At PH there are mostly cabanas and rentable pool beds right near the pool edge.

Casino: Pretty average for a basic Vegas casino. The Craps table was covered in cigarette ashes. Bleh.

Redeeming point for being right next to Fat Tuesday. They have awesome drinks \/drink prices and it was just so much more fun to go there and get a slushy to bring in to the casino. 

Overall I feel like this vacation was a downgrade from last year but we paid the same amount. I'm going to try somewhere else next year.",3,5,1

All they could do was change me to a new room the next day because they needed to reserve the other rooms for ""future guests"" since the only rooms available had a Strip View!

I've stayed at PH about 5 times over a span of 5 years. My most recent stay was in July 2016. I feel like my experience from a few years ago was better then my recent stay. In my opinion, PH has definitely fell off. I felt this time around the customer service was not up to par. Service is super slow! We called the front desk on 2 separate occasions for a refrigerator and extra bath towels. Both times we had to call them twice because they forgotten. A few years ago they also had robes, slippers and complimentary dental kits for guests but apparently they got rid of it. I had a rental car and valet took super long to return your car. When I was playing slots, it was very difficult trying to get the cocktail waitresses attention to order drinks. The pool area is absolutely horrible. They have 2 small pools. One for adults and another for families. In between the 2 pools they have a bunch of daybeds and lounge chairs that no one even uses. Such a waste of space! The room itself was mediocre. Nothing to rave about. I know PH remodeled some rooms, but I happen to be in the older model. I only love PH for the location, affordable rates, cheap eats and for the convenient mall that it's connected to. You really do ""get what you pay for"" here!",0,0,0

The Los Angeles glam and glitz theme is perfectly executed, with the property looking its best and brightest at night.  Most folks who knew the Aladdin well are sure to be impressed at the significant upgrades from the rooms to the casino.

By far the biggest changes have been in their beautiful casino, gorgeous bars \/ lounges, and the upgraded mall now known as the Miracle Mile (formally the Desert Passage).  Cheesy, but most definitely ""LA"" is the Extra Bar & Lounge where the show Extra is actually filmed at least once a week.  I've seen Mario Lopez doing his thing during my last few visits, I seem to forget how short he is practically every time.

Without a doubt, the most impressive interior changes have been made to its casino.  The abundant tables with the chic dealers do a good job of allowing their patrons to enjoy their surroundings.  Poker players are sure to like the decent sized Poker room, however, PH doesn't run many poker events as often as they do other house rated games. I could be wrong on this, but it doesn't seem that their craps tables are rated on odds, resulting in better comps for bigger players.  Their A+ program seems to be pretty good and previous Aladdin players can resume their statuses from past play.  One thing that I wish they'd improve on is the ventilation on the casino floor, its a little too smoky on the weekends.

So what's the deal with the rooms?  The larger suites and some of the standard rooms are still sporting the Aladdin decor, which are all going to be finished sometime this year.  The regular rooms (Hollywood, Deluxe, etc.) are tiny and are 400 sq ft at best.  That's solid for a Manhattan studio but not fabulous in Las Vegas.  The big suites on the other hand (Panarama, Fountain Views, Boulevard etc) are fantastic with plenty of space (1500 sq ft +) and usually sport a great view.

Service all around is fairly good.  From the folks at the front desk to the executive staff running the joint to even the bartenders at the lounges, everyone has been sporting a smile without a snotty LA attitude (thank goodness this theme aspect never carried over).

Since the PH takeover, the demographic for this casino property went from senior citizen level to extremely young.  There are more youngins frequenting this joint more than ever, attracted by the trendy glow of its LA theme with potential celebrity sightings given their constant publicity (Pageants, concerts, Extra airings, shows, etc.).  The younger generation could use some better nightlife, Prive is a disappointment and their lounges can get boring once the eye candy wears thin.",3,2,2

 Valet was convenient as we had a lot of luggage, ice cooler, and snacks. We arrived on a Thursday night at 11:30 pm and there was a long line to check-in. Fortunately, the line moved quickly.

I did the $100 trick, in hopes to upgrade to a suite. The employee searched the system diligently for a good 10 minutes, but apparently they were all booked that weekend and the only upgrade available was a room with a strip view. Boo...

Pros:
Room size-a very spacious room (category RR) with a large foyer and a double door leading to a huge bathroom with two separate sinks. There is a shower and a tub, and the toilet is in a separate room with a full size door. 

Comfy bed. 

Shower water pressure - too much of a good thing is not always good, but I am listing this under the pros because I'd rather have high than lower pressure. It was so strong though, I felt my fat cells beaten to a pulp (again, why its under the pros). But seriously, ph, please adjust the water pressure or you are going to injure someone soon. 

Location-right in the center of the strip! Couldn't be more convenient than this! 

Cons:
Noise level-our room facing the pool can hear and feel the beat of the pool music starting from 9 am. My iPhone app measured the decibel at 67; that's equivalent to the sound level of normal piano practice or a normal conversation between people 3 ft apart.  

Parking\/valet-three days here and we haven't been able to valet. It's always full.  Self parking is quite a ways from the hotel lobby, you have to walk half around the 1 mile shipping center to get to the hotel  there is no shortcut! 

Cleanliness-casino area appears really clean, but the room shows its age age and I would give it 7.5\/10 in cleanliness. Shower tiles and grouts were a little yucky.  At this price range, I am not complaining much.  You do get what you paid for. At least it's way cleaner than Rio's pet friendly room. 

Dog potty area - it's a small grass area about 3 minutes walk from the hotel lobby. It's not  maintained very well but serves its purpose. I just wish all the pet owners would pick up after their pets...we saw several piles of poop left behind even when there is a fully stocked trash bag\/can station. There are large palm tress providing shades most of the day. A good thing during the summer months here.",2,0,0

The casino is within stumbling distance to the flamingos at the Flamingo and lots of restaurants and shops on the strip and is connected to the Miracle Mile Mall.

5-years since last visit.
Pros: miracle mile is remodeled and extended...has some nice shops and a ton of dining options which look so good, like fried lobster, burgers, Mexican, even an oyster bar. Very cool walk.

Cons: same miracle mile walk applies when you self-park; you have to walk with your roll-aways through the whole fucking mile and 1\/2 the fucking casino to register.
Very poor signs, hard to see anything clearly, got lost over and over even on 2nd day still was confused at the layout.
Pool is, by faaaarrrr the WORST I have ever seen inside a LV strip property. Just terrible, and no wonder 65% empty. 2 tiny ass pools, split with some lame disgustingly dirty and blacked chairs that looked filthy. Pools smell like ass, literally. The chorine smells like a combo of ass and feet, my sandals smelled like shit until I got home and scrubbed them to death. Even NYNY pool is better. Hell even buffalo bills on the border (at least it has a cute buffalo shape)
Each pool has maybe 10 lounge chairs, not a typo, TEN. Rest are cabanas, believe me you don't wanna be at this pool its beyond awful. You sit in the middle area with the lounge chairs I mentioned, there is nothing around you but walls, blackjack pit, and the cement ground. You cant even see the pools if you sit there. The left pool is where the disgusting party is at, with 50-60 people in a 15x10 shitty kitty pool swapping venereal diseases, and then the other shitty pool that's quieter. It was so depressing left after 1\/2 hour. If your coming for a vegas pool, this is the LAST resort, literally. Never in my life smelled something so fowl like the whiff of this pool.
Gambling....they have not as many game choices, table wise as other casinos, and very limited double deck blackjack, lots of empty 3 card poker bullshit tables that no one plays.
Nightmare car entrance that's hidden, sooo confusing, and the parking mess. At least its across the cosmo, so you can access that easily, provided their escalators work (which never were in 2 days unfuckingbelievable)
Rooms were dinky, crappy, chipped, marked, pubed.They have 2 tiny-ass drawers, the desk doesn't even have pens and paper, another joke.
Shower pressure was awful, shower looks like 1970's shower. 
In all, an awful experience. Just come walk the mile shops eat something buy something then GTF outta this shithole; stayed at motels with nicer rooms.
No fridge to put drinks.
Everything seems to be on a different level\/floor; the pool, the buffet, the registration, where\/which door is LV Blvd?  Get me the fuck outta here. It was so bad I cut one free day (comps from father in laws slot play) and came back sat night instead of staying another night.

We finally had the chance this past weekend to stay, since it was one of the more reasonably priced hotels for a trip on a whim, and it was a great location - super central, close to the Cosmopolitan (where we like to eat and drink), Paris (more eating) and Aria (even more eating).  Husband booked us a Strip-view room, and we were in the north tower on the 37th floor.

Great views - we were directly across from the Cosmo and could see (and hear) the Bellagio fountains.  However, the amazingness of the room pretty much stops there.

-The bathrooms were outdated
-We had a nice little accumulation of dust on the side tables (and even after housecleaning came by, they were still dusty), and the entertainment unit\/shelving looked pretty tired
-There wasn't much of a theme to the room, basically one or two posters of old movies
-Saturday night there was this strange whooshing sound around our window - it did that every few minutes for about an hour, then went away
-The worst part was when I turned on the sink Saturday night and no hot water came out.  I waited a few minutes, then gave up and continued to brush my teeth.  The next morning, still no hot water (just from the sink, the shower was fine).  We told the front desk upon checking out, so hopefully they went and checked it out.

Basically stay at PH for the location and price, as it's cheaper than Cosmo and Aria but still near shopping and good food.  But for a nicer, more modern stay, go to Aria or Cosmo.",8,4,4

The rooms I've been in were clean and it had a very modern look. Any staff I've interacted with for the most part was pleasant whether is be gambling, eating or just cruising through.
The downsides. If you self park in their 11 floor parking garage you will have to walk through the Miracle Mile shopping complex, from end to end, to get to the hotel. So it's not bad if youre aiming for only the MM but quite a walk if your target is the casino & hotel. Valet is an option to avoid that. Unfortunately the two times I used valet. Both times it took up to 5min just for a valet to come and hand us a ticket since there was a long line and it seemed like only 1 person was doing it. The first valet leaving PH it took about 15min to get the car. The second time after sitting and waiting for about 15min I went back to the valet counter to ask how long more it would be. The guy there got on his walkie and checked for us and after a few minutes he informs us that it seems they've misplaced my car. My friends and I couldn't believe it! We were only there for a couple hours. While waiting to see if the other guy could find it I did talk a little with the valet at the counter and he said they have been short handed alot lately and if I remember correctly, on that day according to him, there was only 2 people running the valet when the norm should be 4-5. I felt kinda dumb but I actually was timing this 2nd time doing valet since how it went the first time. Finally after 30min, the 2nd valet shows up with my car. He explains he hadn't actually lost or misplaced my car, he had lost the keys. So I guess either the counter valet either misheard or misinformed us? He said the keys must have fell out of his pocket when he was in the shuttle they use for valet? Sounded weird but ok. I asked for them to call their boss since this was simply a joke how bad it was at the valet twice now. Someone did show 5min later and I mainly complained about how long the valet takes and how could they let the service get that slow at the valet, going in and out. We were apologized to and about my car keys being misplaced for 30min. Was offered a free buffet there for the 4 of us which we did accept. My friends were staying at PH during that time.
So besides the horrible layout of PH(which didnt change since it was converted from Aladdin) and valet, the rest isn't too bad.",1,1,1

I got an email this morning stating  that I could check in online, so I did so. My flight was due to land at 12:15, so I clicked that I would be checking in at 1 PM. There was a box that you needed to check off stating that you understood early check in (any time before 2) would incur a late charge. When I saw this I decided that I would just do a 2 PM check in so as not to incur a late charge. When I clicked the 2 PM check in time the box was no longer there and I did not need to check on any boxes acknowledging that I may have to pay an early check in fee.

To  my surprise, when my plane landed, I saw I had an email from Planet Hollywood stating that my room was ready. I got to the hotel about 1 PM to go to the key pick up line as stated. The concierge was helpful at first with the whole process, until he was ready to swipe my card and mentioned that I would need to pay a $22 early check in fee. I explained the situation and he did not seem to care. His only response was that everyone else was paying the early check in fee, so I needed to as well. He said if I'd like I can come back at 3PM to wait on line again and fill out the paperwork so I wont be charged a fee. Needless to say, I got agitated and as I was arguing my point he raised his voice at me telling me I need to pay the fee or come back at 3. 

At this point I asked to speak to a manager thinking that they would be able to rectify this. I explained my  point to the manager and she just repeated what he had said that I either need to pay the fee or come back at 3, because everyone else is paying it. Needless to say there is some sort of disconnect between their webpage and hotel staff, but this is in NO WAY the guest's fault. I am not paying for the room or expenses, as it is a business trip, but it was the principle of it which agitated me. My company also spent thousands of dollars to have our booth at this show which is taking place at the Planet Hollywood, so you would think management should be able to waive a $22 fee when they are completely in the wrong, but I guess not. 

I have been here many times, and will never stay or play here under any circumstances. I also used the word ""bullshit"" which this situation clearly was, while stating my case to the manager, to which she went off on me about using profanity and not to do it again (while raising her voice to make a scene) as if she was about to get me kicked out.

Our room also had a partial view of the Bellagio fountains, which was an added bonus.  I also liked that the toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom, which is great because someone can do their business while another can still use the sink.

Not only is PH located in the middle of the strip, it also its own shopping mall with over a hundred affordable shops, awesome slot machines that you can actually win playing and decent tables, which makes it a great place to stay at.

Also, the mirror in there is giant, which is wonderful when a bunch of girls are trying to get ready simultaneously. I shared the room with two friends and we didn't feel crowded at all. 

We went in February so we didn't go to the pools, but we took a gander and they were pretty nice. The lobby is eh, i didn't like the decor. We got a voucher for a free bottle after checkin. We didn't redeem it til our last night because we thought it'd be a tiny little sampler bottle but it was pretty big :)

I'd stay here again because the rooms are great, the location is smack in the middle of the strip and the Spice Market buffet is right down stairs...yumm.

I really want to like the hotel and want to stay here again but there are other reasons that I wouldn't stay here again.  The customer service was horrible at best in some locations of the hotel while other services were great, and the rooms were larger than most. 

Checking in was easy and quick, but unfortunately I had to use the services of the bell desk. The bell staff were rude and more into their own personal conversations than their guests. I was expecting my luggage to arrive through from the airline, and I let the bell desk know the details of what I needed. I provided all information and they never requested anything else from me. When I returned to claim my luggage I was informed that it arrived but then they took it with them because no cash was on hand, which was news to me. They had no way of contacting the delivery service and were of no help and did not try to provide any assistance. They told me ""it's your bag, you can do whatever you want with it."" I spoke to the manager and he promised to take care of it. He promised to provide some form of compensation before I left which never happened. 

After checking in I read a few reviews about PH and realized a pattern and that a lot of the reviews were complaining about the air quality and how they felt when they woke up in the morning. I really did not pay too much attention to it because the rooms seemed clean and updated. I quickly realized that the appearance didn't mean everything else had been updated. The first morning I woke up my throat was soar and I couldn't breath. I took some meds to help out with my problems but I felt that way the entire stay at PH. As soon as I checked out of the hotel I began to feel better. Reading others reviews and experiencing PH myself, there is an obvious air quality problem. It's an old hotel, originally the Aladdin, but that's not an excuse to subject their guest to such poor air quality. 

The rooms are very nice...updated, young and fun with some movie memorabilia on the walls. The rooms are the largest that I have stayed in in Vegas, and the bathrooms are huge with two separate sinks and separate tub and shower. This was just the standard double room. 

I did not get to experience a lot of the hotel and casino but it seemed that they had a lot to offer in the way of bars, restaurants and entertainment. They were putting in a Cabo Wabo which will be opening soon. 

With the horrible air quality and how it made me feel during my trip, and the poor, insulting service at the bell desk I would not stay at PH again. I would come back for everything else they had to offer.",1,0,0

2. Since I was very rudely turned away from Valet I had to self-park and walk though the entire miracle mile mall searching for the elevator to my room. This is ridiculous.

3. The room was dirty. There was hair in the bathtub and the bed..yes you read that right THE BED. How disgusting is that?!? 

4. The shower had hardly any water pressure and the shower head was caked with limescale. They obviously have neglected cleaning of the shower head for what looked like years.

5. My room must have been near some kind of air vents or plumbing, there was a loud thunder sounding noise ALL NIGHT and ALL DAY every couple of minutes. The noise was so loud that the floor in the bathroom would actually vibrate. Sleep was something I got very little of due to the noise.

We stayed for 4 days and enjoyed our time here. We had a Titanic themed 'Fountain View' room (it is SO worth paying the extra few $$ to upgrade) and the standard was excellent.

The only major complaint (and it is MAJOR) is that I was really to kill someone by the time I checked out, due to the non-stop obscene and disrespectful harrassment by the PH staff trying to promote their new condos being built out the back.
The basic game play is:
- someone stands at every PH entrance elevator door, corridor, casino opening, hallway, restaurant door inside PH and asks you if you've ""Received your free comps when checking in?""

- Make the mistake of saying 'No' and you get told you get a free show compliments of PH, and they take you to the 'Guest Services' desk where they then tell you to get the free show, you need to sign up for a 2 hour 'tour' of their new condo facility and a sales meeting. When you say 'no thankyou' they will follow you through the Casino and harrass the living shit out of you until you have to be extremely rude and tell them to piss off and leave you alone.

- then you find there are 2 more people standing behind the first person who will also ask you if you've received your free comps at checkin, and you get this everywhere you go, everywhere in the casino, all times of the day and night for the entire duration of your stay.

- Say 'No thankyou' very politely when you walk past, they will either give you attitude, or will follow you and try to stand infront of you to make you walk over to their services desk.

By about the morning of day 3, I was starting to tell them to f*ck off as I was so fed up with having to fight my way through the Casino. We (along with other guests) were making creative ways to get in and out of the Casino and our hotel rooms without having to go through their main stalking grounds. It was ridiculous.

For this reason alone I'm torn between saying this is an awesome hotel (with all of the restaurants, great gaming, great rooms, very clean, Mile shops) and saying if you can stay somewhere equally as good for the same or a little more $$...go there instead.

We had a rental car, so we had to park in the garage adjacent to Miracle Mile shops and walk through the mall at 11:00 at night in attempts of finding the lobby to check-in. I do wish that the walk wasn't so far from the car, because there is nothing worse than being jet-lagged and exhausted aimlessly wondering around a mall and casino. The pool area is also medicore, nothing fancy in terms of Vegas pools though. 

Overall, the location is centrally located, so you are within walking distance to almost anything on the Strip. I would stay here again if I struck up a sweet deal, although I'm not sure I would pay regular rate.",1,0,0

We couldn't figure out the best way to get in - all of our attempts at discovering the back entrance failed and we ended up on the bloody Strip on a Friday night. There were construction cones in front of the casino, blocking off any normal entrances. Eeeek! 

Inside the casino, the ""transformation"" from Aladdin to Planet Hollywood seems incomplete. Much of the mall is still desert-themed, but the music is just loud thumping dance shite like ""Ice, Ice Baby."" WTF? Sephora and L'occitane, two of my favorite stores, became very unpleasant because of the horrible music. Oh yes, let's shop at Sur la Table while we bump and grind to Fergie. 

The ""Halo Bar"" was stupidly designed and way overpriced. 7 bucks for a pyramid hefeweizin! And we didn't even get a glass with that.

The Aladdin used to be one of my favorite casinos because of the Desert Pasage shopping, now I can't imagine going there again unless I end up with more tickets for one of their shows. And even then, it would have to be a pretty good show.",2,3,0

We also tried to nape during the day to be able to party later at night but were unable to since the music from the pool was so loud even though we were on the 28th floor.

It is across Aria and Cosmopolitan, and beside the Paris hotel. Also check-in is at 4 pm, but we checked in early at 1:30 pm with no extra charge! You probably have everything you would need or, at least what you would like to buy inside the Miracle Mile Shops. You got Bath and Body Works if you forgot your soap, you have Victorias Secret if you need a new pair of lingerie, a lot of clothes and shoe stores in case you won and you needed new ones for the trip. 

Food: You got to try Earl of Sandwich! They are open 24\/7! 

Casino: I saw first hand the elder gentleman beside me won the progressive jackpot of $15,000.00! Sucked for me, great for him! I loved the strawberry dacquiri- virgin or not, they were pretty good! I loved that they had redbull too to keep you up with your gambling needs, lol! 

Service: It depends. We stayed there for a week. There were nights in were a certain area, the girl in charge there rarely passed. I had to flag down an attendant to call her. There were 2 nights in where the same girl served us at the dollar slot machine area, whereas she was pretty attentive, prompt and very kind. She was my lucky charm too! I won like $600 in both nights in that area with her serving our drinks. 

The Hallway to the Room: Better than Paris at least. The vibe is definitely modern and for the young crowd.

The Standard Room: Our standard room was on the 37th floor. It was pretty high-up and the view was amazing! We had the mountain view which is the back but the Vegas skyline was glowing at night! 

PROS:
Very nice bedroom set-up. Very modern touch. 
All three were separate: the toilet, the tub and the shower. I love the bath tub!  
My room had a table and chair for my laptop, with a lamp on it.
Your wifi connection is free for at least one device. So better decide if you will be using that free wifi for the laptop or your phone.
Flat screen HD tv.
Big closet space.
Big room and decent spacing inside.
Coffee chair and table inside.
Had iron and ironing board inside the closet.
For it's price- the standard room is way better than Paris. Paris feels like a cheap hotel because of the looks of the room and the hallway. It is cheap too! You can get a deal at smartervegas.com. Better than Kayak or Travelocity!


CONS:
You pay $25 for the fridge per night.
I noticed some dust on the curtains and on the AC vent.
The toilet is cool that it was separated and has a door for privacy but, someone forgot to include the exhaust fan on the ceiling! Your ish stinks unless you have a candle lit!  There should be at least 2 exhaust fan: 1 inside the toilet room and 1 inside the actual bathroom- to get rid of the smell or the humidity in the air.",7,4,3

If you are injured and it is their fault, they turn you over to CCMSI which is their 3rd party adjuster and they NEVER have any intention of repaying you for your costs associated with the injury. My grandmother, my mom, myself and two others stayed in a suite at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas from June 18 to June 22, 2012.

The morning we were to leave, my 84 year old grandmother entered the restroom and fell into the wall hitting her head. There was water totally covering the floor due to a cracked toilet. She had out of pocket expenses associated with her testing and follow up care. There is a two year statute of limitations to recoup your expenses. She and my mom talked with the claim adjuster on a regular basis. Cannon Cochran Management Services, Inc. (CCMSI) first adjuster was Joy Van Riper. She was replaced by Doug Buchanan in 2014. Ms. Riper stated her client, Planet Hollywood and Caesar's Entertainment was responsible for the water in the restroom due to a cracked toilet and they would reimburse my grandmother for her expenses. Doug Buchanan confirmed this fact to my mom.

We were told in writing her claim would be settled June 3 or 4 of this year, 2014. On June 5' my mom called Doug Buchanan and was told he FORGOT to have my mom sign a form for Medicare to release her records to them. It was explained that CCMSI had to repay Medicare for the part they paid on my grandmother's bills.

Finally today when my mom and brother kept calling them, Doug finally told my brother he should file a lawsuit, there would be NO settlement. My uncle asked Doug if he enjoyed taking money from 84 year olds. He said, ""That's my job."" Wow...such arrogance and so sad for all the people that stay at a Caesar's Entertainment property.

We called Doug Buchanan's supervisor, Josie. She told me she advised us to file a lawsuit. We have exactly one day, June 20 since the statute runs out Sunday. We live in Texas.

So I guess the mob is still alive and well at Caesar's Entertainment and CCMSI. This is so sad and illegal since they are defrauding YOU as YOU had to help pay my grandmother's medical bills through Medicare and it was THEIR admitted fault and not yours.

PLEASE, NEVER stay at a Caesar's property because if you get hurt, they will NOT help. Their properties include Caesar's Palace, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Bally's, Harrah's, The Quad, Rio, and the Flamingo in Las Vegas. They own others around the country. Please help spread the word about them taking advantage of the elderly and defrauding the U S Government through Medicare fraud. We will not rest until there is justice for my grandmother.",20,4,1

The hotel itself is always clean. Rooms are very nice (good beds), and we've never had an issue getting our room cleaned.

The location on the strip is pretty central. I've stayed at MGM before, and I love MGM, but it's nice to be closer to the middle of the strip.

Restaurant selection is good for quick bites. I like Planet Dailies for breakfast, as well as PF Chang's for a quick bite or the Earl of Sandwich. If you're into buffets, Spice Market is top notch!

One of my very favorite reasons for staying at Planet Hollywood is the mall! It's convenient to get some liquor or drinks there without getting raped at the PH gift shops. I also like to eat breakfast there, since it's WAY cheaper than anything in the hotel.

Someone had noted if you're driving in and parking your car, you have to walk through a large part of the mall to get to the hotel, which is true, and kind of a pain. I have also had a hard time figuring out where things are at PH. It seems like the main casino floor is set up in a circle, and I've never really figured it out. Luckily, I always go with my husband, who seems to know where he is going.

Checked in on September 4, 2010 just for one night.  They gave me room 2217 and I immediately brought my bag to the bathroom to inspect the bed and the headboard.  I am SUPER PARANOID about bedbugs so it's always the very first thing I do when checking into a hotel.  There was not a total infestation.  The mattress actually looked okay but as I was ready to start checking the headboard and I noticed one crawling right on the white sheets.  I killed it by smashing it with the ball point pen next to the phone.  At least it was only one but that was all I needed to see.  I then called the front desk and was on hold for about 5 minutes before I was able to speak to someone.  He told me he would have housekeeping come by and take a look.  I said I wanted a new room which they immediately changed.  The lady from housekeeping looked at the bug and confirmed it was a bedbug.

The next room I freaked out on and checked it no less than 4 times and I left my bag and everything in the bathroom covered in a huge garbage bag (I brought a garbage bag from home).  In this room I took the headboard apart from the wall and looked extensively with a flashlight (also brought from home) and I saw nothing.  The headboard was attached to the wall with velcro so it wasn't hard to take off or put back on.

I woke up several times during the night just to check and see if anything was crawling on the sheets.  Luckily, I saw no bedbugs in the new room.

Please, please check your bed and surrounding area.

So the entryway and doors have all been redone. It was cool looking and gave a definite young party atmosphere. Even the music playing was good. 

I arrived late in the evening so I was starving and slightly cranking, in rare Heather form. My room, unimpressive. The bathroom was huge which is always nice. Big sunken tub, separate shower and the toilet in a separate room. All fairly standard in Vegas though. Internet was difficult to connect to but hey I have Windows Vista and it sucks. 

I search the room for my room service menu and a robe to get into when it arrives. Neither are around. I called down to the front desk and get prompted to press a bunch of numbers to get connected to the appropriate person. I am getting hungrier and hungrier by the moment. Boo.

Pros:
Very large room, nicely decorated with a flat-screen TV and memorobelia from a past movie (I was in the 'Empire Records' room).
The largest bathroom I may have ever seen! Plus the 'commode' is in it's own room inside the bathroom so while one person is, shall we say ""busy"" the other can be taking a shower (or a bath, there are both in the bathroom!) using the sink or whatever.
Pillow-top mattress cover.  Very comfy!
Great mall attathed to Hotel\/Casino

Cons:
Paper-thin walls.
Loooooong walk through the mall from self-parking to Hotel\/Casino
Self-parking garage VERY full (I stayed mid-week)
Slow elevators and rooms on upper floors (above 30?) require the use of two elevators (from what I was told by someone staying on a higher upper floor)
I was on the 20th floor in a pool-view room, which was nice however a live band played in the pool area until about ten and because the walls are so thin it did get a bit loud.  Turning-on the TV helped to drown-out the sound however.
They charge for WiFi by the number of devices you use.  I didn't use the Hotel's WiFi but while checking-in heard someone complaining about their rates.

The hotel itself has a fantastic location, it is right on the strip and gets a lot of traffic. The overall atmosphere is young and fun. They have a lot of table games and a generous amount of slot machines. They have a couple restaurants which serve your typical quality foods for Vegas. 

I had a chance to stay in one of the newer rooms. I must say it was nice, bright and refreshing. Overall I only have a couple complaints about this property and here they are:

1. Drinks - I played for an hour at the slots across from the bar and not once did anyone offer me a drink. I went to the bar and told the guy and he looked at me like I was crazy. I ordered 2 vodka and sodas and it came out in a small glass for $22 plus tip. Needless to say that was a very steep price for a drink with a little alcohol in it. 

2. The elevators - the last 3 times I have stayed here the same elevators have been broken. They start to close, buzz and then open again. They have not been fixed in months. 

3. Parking - I used the valet parking and it was $18\/day. I understand that the hotels in Vegas are going to a paid model but what gets me is I spent more than $5,000 on table games and slots and when I asked if they could come a day or two of parking they basically laughed at me. 

Overall this is a nice property and I will be staying there again. If you stay just be prepared for expensive drinks and parking.",0,0,0

We get there and find out that really that was just a preference\/suggestion and nope, they don't have those rooms available. Only smoking rooms with a king size bed.  (Only this was a lie because the person who checked in immediately after I did was able to get a non-smoking room, funny how one became immediately available after I checked in, when there were 0 available 30 seconds before).  

 The room smelled horrible.  Really disgustingly bad.  Like someone had just finished smoking a carton of cigarettes the second before we entered the room.  If I had asthma this room would have killed me.

We go to the room and we were given a handicap accessible room.  Ok, whatever, I didn't really plan on taking a bath anyway. The handicap accessible shower was the size of a normal bathtub, but it was a walk-in shower with a little rubber strip on the edge.  The shower head was on the long wall of the shower.  So taking a shower required the water to shoot straight out of the shower area all over the bathroom floor.  Great water pressure though!  Water shot about 2 feet outside of the shower area!

There was a crack in the bathroom sink. The sink would gurgle for 5 minutes after it had been used.  Loudly enough to be heard from the bed.  Luckily the heater was incredibly loud every time it clicked on, so that drowned out the gurgle.

I almost forgot.  Randomly the power in the bathroom would go out.  Apparently, this is a normal thing and not something to worry about.  You just need to make sure to press the reset button in the outlet to get the lights to go back on. No big deal.  

Frankly, I would not go back here.  I enjoyed my stays at Harrah's and Bally's a lot more.  PH is overpriced for the lackluster experience.",5,1,1

The crappy thing was that valet was always full and we had to self park. Stayed there for 5 days and only valet once. I also asked for the city view hoping that I could see most of the strip but the window was so tiny lol. I noticed people complain about not having a fridge in this hotel, but mostly all hotels in Vegas don't have a fridge cause they want you to go downstairs to spend money (FYI)  

Also, the reception sucked. Couldn't really talk on the phone cause it kept cutting out. I couldn't hear ppl and they couldn't hear me. Internet was slow so use their wifi. You do have to pay $35 a day for it anyway.

We stayed (and paid what we thought was a good rate for the center of the strip) 7\/21-7\/24, could not have been a worse stay.  Like many people have said previously, the auto entrance to PH is not from the strip, you enter from Harmon Ave, then you have to pick between the Valet at the check-in area or Self Park which is way far from the check-in (you trapes through the Mircle Mile Mall to get to the front desk.  Its very confusining. A quick note on the Valet...they lost our car one time, found it after 30 minutes, later they were rude when I asked if my car had been brought up yet...""yes, I called out your name and you did not answer""...the car was pulled up far away from the valet area.

Ok, now for the room experience...we checked in between 3-4 pm and received the keys to our standard room, got up to the 32nd floor...the room is small looked old and not kept up.  First thing we noticed was that there is VERY LITTLE drawer and closet space...then we noticed that the Armoire had two doors RIPPED OFF.  We went down to the front desk and reported the condition and asked for a new room.  We got the keys to the new room, 20th floor...actually a worse room!  The only thing better was this was a View room of the Bellagio fountains.  Still small, the armoire had the doors, but still very little space to unpack.  Here is where it get's worse, the view would have been fine if the shades on the window would work, they were down and would not go up.  They were very old and frayed.  Called maintaince, we also needed them to replace the shower head (it was old and corrded) and clear the bathroom drain (it was very slow).  Then later in the stay the old phone in the room died and we had to get maintaince again!

The Hotel lay out is horrible, I am used to casino's being hard to figure out and get through (till you get used to them), but with mall being part of it, makes it worse.  Actually what really makes it bad is that they give you a ""map"" to the property that is probably the WORST HOTEL MAP I have ever seen.  It covers the bottom 3 floors of the hotel, lobby, casino and mezzanine.  What made the map so bad was that all 3 floors were placed on the map facing a different direction...THEY DO NOT RELATE TO EACH OTHER!  There is no compass (North) direction for you to reference!  Also they do not give directions to the pool (on the 6th floor roof) I will talk about that later.

We went down on Sunday to speak to a manager about the problems we had and the (top) manager on duty (Rodrigo?) was worthless, he offered us $25 credit at the property for our bother.  When we asked him about the Surf show playing at the hotel, he had no idea what we were talking about, much less to be able to get us a discount on tickets.  We had to go to ""Tix4Tonight"" to get 1\/2 off the tickets to the show Monday night (it was a good show, but less than half full!).  

The pool's are smallish, one for family's the other for adults, with very little space around each pool to lay out (unless you pay $50+ for a bed or cabana).  There is a huge lounge area away from the pools, but you are away from the pool,  it is dirty and old.

I guess if you are a single 21-25 year old, this would be an acceptable place to stay on the strip, but otherwise pass (especially if you are in the late 40 to early 50 range).",1,0,0

I had a two-day stay: 7\/7\/14 - 7\/9\/14.

The good: I really appreciated the professionalism and politeness throughout the hotel.  The overall appearance of the hotel was good. The casino had a very hip a lively feeling - great music!  The pool area was clean and relaxing. The room décor was average, with somewhat of an artsy look.   

The bad: When I checked in, I was given the wrong room number. I attempted to access a room that was already occupied. This was a very embarrassing and uncomfortable situation. I had to return to the front desk and wait in line all over again. As I was waiting, there were people walking up and not waiting in line, which added further delay. The attendant apologized, and I know it was an honest mistake, but it really impacted my schedule.  

The UGLY: My rook looked like it had not been cleaned. I suspect the cleaning crew just added some clean towels and neglected to clean the rest of the room. As I entered the room, the bed looked as if someone had been lying on top of the comforter.  Upon further inspection of the room, I noticed the following:
* A filthy tub with visible dirt and grime. 
* A dirty bathroom floor with shoeprints, sticky spots, hair, and a small piece of trash.
* The carpet had dried white spots that crumbled when I ran my foot across it. 
* A dusty bathroom countertop with visible finger lines in the dust. 
* Dusty tables and dusty areas throughout the bedroom.
* Hair on the toilet seat.
* Hair on the bathroom floor.
* Dirty carpet.
* A small metal rod on the floor in the bathroom.

I attempted to call Housekeeping and the front desk, but I continued to get a busy signal. I went back to the front desk (2nd time in 30 minutes) to complain, but the line was long, and once again, there were people walking up and not waiting in line. 

I ended up cleaning the room - I dusted, wiped, sanitized, and picked up trash. All of this caused me to be late for a show, but I really could not use the bathroom until I cleaned it. It was just gross.

After the end of a long Vegas weekend, we had to switch hotels because most of our big group had already left to go back home. So we switched to a different hotel with a much smaller room, and ended up in Planet Hollywood. This is my second time that I've stayed at this hotel and it might possibly be my last. There were no issues at all my first time around. I liked that it's located in the middle of the strip and it was fairly clean. This last time I stayed here though, was a different story. 

So here's the gist of my last experience here: there was a freaking cockroach in our room! I could have sworn we booked a room for 3 guests, and not 3 guests plus a damn bug. Anyways, we called the front desk and told them that we had an unwelcomed guest in our room. First off, there are two phones in the room. We used the phone that was the furthest from the damn cockroach to call, but it doesn't freaking work! So we had to use the phone where the damn cockroach hiding underneath. So we get a hold of the front desk and tell them of our situation, but what appalled me was that they did not immediately change us rooms. No. Instead, they told us they'll send someone up to the room to check for themselves as if we were lying. About 10 minutes later, two hotel staff comes in the room, see the unexpected guest and finally deem us worthy of a room change. I mean, I wasn't expecting the room to be comped or even an upgrade. A damn apology would have sufficed. Nope. Didn't even get one. Even with the room change, the three of us were still paranoid about what was in the new room we were in. 

Definitely left a very sour taste in my mouth. Will most likely not stay here ever again. There are plenty of other hotel options in Vegas.",7,6,2

1. The price is fantastic. Very affordable. Allows me to waste more of my money gambling or eating or buying Las Vegas themed magnets or whatever foolishness I might be getting into. 

2. Great location - easy access\/quick walk to so many other places. 

3.  Connected to the Miracle Mile shopping mall which allows for a larger variety of stores (for booze, water, snacks, assorted Las Vegas themed junk) and restaurants (not to mention the shopping). 

4. If you're staying on the North side of PH you have a picturesque view of the Bellagio fountains and strip.

5. Rooms were decorated and clean. (I had the Jessica Lange room) Easy to use in-room safe. Plenty of storage space. I was in a basic room and it included a full size ironing board and iron, as well as a hair dryer. The tv was poor quality and difficult to use (I know, it's a tv right?). There was a delay in changing channels so you had to wait a long time to figure out what channel you were on. When I was able to access the guide for shows, I couldn't get out of it no matter what I did and had to turn off the tv and turn it back on. There wasn't any explanation in the room as to how to use it, etc. or what channels were what as there usually is. I only watched tv while getting into bed for the night anyway, so it wasn't much of an issue - only an annoyance. The resort fee (about $20\/day) includes use of the gym and use of wifi for one device per room. So if you have 2 ipads or whatever that need wifi, you'll only be able to connect (through the resort fee) to one device. I think additional wifi is $15\/day. 

6. I really don't have any complaints other than the fact that I spent most of my time disoriented in the PH casino. It's probably just me (I'm an idiot 90% of the time), but the casino there was laid out so that (for me) it was hard to determine what was where. Even after 4 days in the place, I was still wandering around not entirely sure where I was or how to get where I was supposed to be going. 

7.  Friendly staff. 

I'd recommend PH and would stay there again. If you're looking for something easy, convenient, and affordable, this is a good option. It's no Cosmopolitan or Bellagio, so if you're looking for super swanky, this is not the place for you. It is not a luxury hotel. Keep your expectations in check and you'll be fine.",2,1,2

Pros:
- Middle of the strip and everything is within walking distance
- Everyone there was helpful. They answered all my questions and concerns politely with a smile :) 
- Rooms are fairly affordable 
- Plenty of parking
- TV has CABLE :)
- Fat Tuesday and Earls Sandwiches are in the same building
- The blackout blinds work GREAT! I wouldn't know what time of day it was with them down.

Cons:
- Our glass cups had foundation on it (for guys, it's make-up) and eyeliner on the pillows. What else did they not change?!
- The comforter had BLOOD (stain) on it-- it was a pretty big blob too. From a girls perspective, it looked like menstrual blood... YUCK. I couldn't tell if it was old or fresh, and I honestly didn't want to find out.
- The shower drain clogged up each and every time we used it
- The tub had pubic hair in it :( 
- There is no ventilation in the toilet room. I say toilet room because the toilet is in it's own little room.. durr.
- You can hear people using the bathroom from above and side-to-side throughout the night. It's fairly loud so light sleepers beware!
- Someone stole our 'Do not disturb"" sign! The cleaning crew tried to come in but luckily we had the doors locked. This gave me a shock! I thought someone was trying to break in. Though this isn't the hotels fault.


Each room are themed, and I don't really care for them. I felt that they took up unnecessary space. I don't mind that the garage is on the other side of the Miracle Miles shop. Walk you lazies! It'll only take up 10 minutes MAX of your sweet time plus, you'll need to walk off all the food and alchie consumed. Check-in is at 4PM and check-out is at 11AM.

There is no way to beat Planet Hollywood's location and things to do. Large Casino, shops and restaurants all around the miracle mile, starbucks by the front desk, Pin Up pizza and Pinks outside that makes perfect hangover food, ABC stores to ensure you have absolutely everything you need without having to even step outside. And if you do step outside, you are right in the middle of the strip! 10 minute walk to the bellagio or cosmo, 15 to ceasers, paris right next door.  It's excellent.

If you do end up wanting to splurge, the Apex Suite is where you want to be. We did the 2 bedroom extender, over 2,000 sq feet, iPod dock, gaming tables, huge tv's, and amazing views. We could watch the bellagio fountains from the living room! Had a group of 9 (4 girls 5 guys - early 20's mind you) that all slept in this suite without bumping heads!

Don't want to walk through the sales people to get to the front desk? Get valet service for your car, it's FREE and they work off of tips. If the lot says 'FULL', proceed to go in because they still offer it to guests staying at the hotel!

Also, check in can take a little bit of time, but nothing ridiculous. The key is to stand where they can see you and get their attention, no that's not ideal but it's not a big enough draw back for me to lower my rating for this hotel.  Friendly people behind the desk, helped me with everything I needed.

We had a room with two ""queen"" size beds that are actually closer to full size. The rooms were spacious with a desk and comfy seat. The bathroom is large with a tub, separate shower, and separate toilet. The door to the main bathroom doesn't actually lock and is more like a closet door that just slides shut. It's possible to be taking a shower or bath and just having someone accidentally walk in.  Not a huge problem, but a strange design. It would be better to have two separate vanities since girls taking ready to go out always take a long time. There was a large flat panel TV with HD service in case you want to watch something, so that's a nice touch. 

What's nice about Planet Hollywood is that it's in a great location right across the street from Bellagio. I had dinner, and a lunch at Bellagio so that was super convenient to just walk out the door and across the street. City center is always across the street as well which is also something worth checking out if you're into high end boutiques. There's an Early of Sandwich near the entrance into the Miracle Mile which is a great deal for a cheap meal. The ABC convenience stores inside the mall are a good resource for cheap snacks and drinks. There are two pools on the 6th floor which is nice for hanging out and lounging around. There's also a big area that has lounge chairs and umbrellas if you don't care to get in the water. 

Overall, I liked staying at Planet Hollywood and prices were reasonable. The biggest downside is that self parking is really far away from the main casino and rooms and you have to walk through half the mall. Definitely valet it but be prepared to wait for your car to be fetched.",1,0,1

Like Paris Las Vegas and Bally's, which are a short 5 to 10 minute walk  to the left of the Miracle Mile Shops, Planet Hollywood (PH) has a great location. Aside from the aforementioned hotels, Las Vegas' Hard Rock Cafe, the Signature (of MGM), and Grand Chateau among others are also near by. The hotel is on the corner of Harmon and S Las Vegas Blvd., so it's right behind the overpass\/bridge that allows you to easily and quickly reach other nearby hotels located on the other side; The Bellagio, the Cosmopolitan, ARIA, Vdara, the Monte Carlo, and the Mandarin Oriental are the closest.

Planet Hollywood's casino is probably one of my favorites. It is a larger floor with many poker tables located in the middle (including the Pleasure Pit, featuring sexy dancers around the tables), while the slot machines are wrapped around the entire area. There are a handful of ATMs and bill breakers scattered around the floor, and a cashier's cage near the 1-cent slots. I also noticed many cocktail waitresses walking around, which is great (and needed) given the number of people who walk in and out throughout the day.

One of the best qualities of this hotel is that it already has plenty of shopping and dining options in its immediate area or a few yards away. The hotel owns the Miracle Mile Shops, which is conveniently right next to the casino (and accessible from inside it as well); there are take out spots, a food court, 'frozen' daiquiri vendors, a couple sports bars, and sit-in restaurants scattered around this large shopping complex. Just outside the mall and PH casino is an open area where you can see impersonators, costumed characters (dressed sexy, not dressed at all\/body paint only, cartoons, etc.), artists, musicians, and more.

As mentioned earlier, I cannot speak on what the rooms are like--hence the 3-star review. However, given the reviews and pictures left by other Yelpers along with my own experience in and around the hotel, I'd consider staying here the next time I'm visiting.",0,0,0

But apparently it seems the front desk employees have no idea what these themed rooms look like anyways. Don't get me wrong, I had no issue with the front desk people, they were friendly but unfortunately clueless.

The room my friend and I were put in was originally meant to be temporary because we asked for a non smoking and we were told that they had no non smoking rooms available at the moment but would switch rooms the next day, which was fine, we could deal with spending one night in a smoking room.

But to our horror, we entered the dark room patting down all the walls for a light switch. I took a few steps inside the pitch black room using my phone for light and was horrified when I thought I saw a man standing inside a closet in the room. Turns out we were placed in a Saw movie themed room. ""The man"" I saw standing in the room was a mannequin hanging from the ceiling of the closet. The room also had creepy notes on the coffee table, a picture of the Saw Clown, and a bunch of gory movie memorabilia. We had no doubt in our minds that we DID NOT want to wake up to the mannequin of a crazy man hanging at the foot of our bed in the middle of the night. Long story short, we stayed in that room for less than half an hour before we spoke to the manager and had him change our room. The first alternative he offered was a Halloween Movie themed room (???) which would've been no better than where we were. Finally, he places us in a Julia Roberts themed room which just so happened to be NON SMOKING! How did they not know they had this room to begin with!? 

When my friend and I went to the front desk we got the impression that the workers there had absolutely no idea what the rooms looked like. And we were told that they've had complaints about that room before. I was glad I was not traveling with my nieces or nephews because they would've freaked out if they had been in that room. Definitely not family friendly!!

I'll give 2 stars because the manager that took care of us called us after we had gotten our new room to make sure that the room was okay. Then he asked us what exactly was in that Julia Roberts themed room (?). Kinda strange that even he doesn't have a clue as to whats in these rooms. My suggestion though, for the horror themed rooms, WARN guests before placing them in the room, or have a sign on the door before entering.

******
Now, the room itself.... leaves much to be desired. When we first got to the room i noticed quite a bit of dust on the nightstand, and during our entire 3 day trip... that dust remained there and was never wiped down. We missed the speaker where you could plug your phone in to get hyped up for a night out like we had at the Aria, but I guess the Aria is no comparison when it comes to modern rooms. (The Aria is in a  completely different league!) Even the batteries in our tv remote were old! The lighting in the room is horrible, you have no choice but to do your make up in the bathroom or you'll end up looking like a trainwreck. The lighting is even bad during the day, with the curtains wide open. The only good thing about the room (besides the cute Julia Roberts memorabilia) would be the spacious bathroom. Its large enough for at least 2 girls to get ready for the club at the same time. Has 2 counters on opposite sides each with a sink. An awesome hot tub which we used to soak our aching feet the next day... A refrigerator would've been nice to chill our alcohol or chase tho. We did not appreciate the drilling in the early morning from the construction of the pool area while hungover, this is Vegas right!?

The only thing that PH has going for it is location, location, location, and they know it. This is why they won't bother modernizing their rooms until they absolutely need to! Fat Tuesday is in the Miracle Mile Shops thats connected to PH, PF Changs, Pinkies and Earl's offer a great selection of nearby food. The lobby itself is glamorous but unfortunately it's not a true representation of what awaits their guests.",0,0,0

Pros: GREAT location; right in the middle of the strip across from Bellagio. When we checked in, we gave the man $20 and got upgraded to a fountain view. If you stay here, they give you a coupon book that has some pretty good deals in there like $25 match play, $5 every person for the buffet, etc. If you're a penny saver, you'll appreciate the coupon book. The casino looks more hip than classy (which could be a pro or a con). They're right next to the miracle shops so it's convenient. They have some pretty yummy places like Earl of Sandwich and Yolos.

Cons: The pool area isn't that impressive. The rooms aren't anything special. For a hotel that just opened almost two years ago, it looked a little worn down to me. The crap dealers are a little anal and not as fun as other casinos (or maybe it was just that night). The walls are super thin so I can hear the housekeepers cleaning the next room at 8AM. 

Overall, the hotel wasn't that bad but I don't think I'd stay here again. I'm glad we got a great deal because I don't know if I'd stay here for the regular price. But I do wanna come back and try their panoramic suite (featured in the movie 21) sometime.",5,1,1

I came and stayed in planet hollywood last month and exactly a year ago.

The service was terrible both times.
Last year:
I was celebrating my 21st birthday and arrived the day prior.
Everybody with me went to apply for a Total Rewards card here which was located right next one of the entrances of the hotel so we all went in line together.
I was standing pretty far from the counter, barely in earshot and the lady asked if i was 21, ""I said not until tomorrow!"" and she shot me a dirty look and told me I couldn't stand there. Are you going to tell me go step outside into the scorching heat?

This year:
Someone in my party was upgraded to platinum status with two free buffet passes.
We went to go redeem them at the TR counter and lo and behold, it's a different team of people and it's still unbearable.
There was no line, but it took us 45 minutes from the time we walked up to the counter and the time we left.
Dana is absolutely horrible, she began to work with us and my mom had some questions. Granted, her english isn't the best but i'm sure you work with a ton of foreign customers that have even more limited english. She was immediately rude right off the bat. Spoke with a pretentious tone and didn't even try to understand her question which really wasn't that difficult.
Immediately i grew a dissatisfied look on my face and one of the other employees noticed so she tried to make some small talk, sorry that's not going to help enough.
After she took 15 minutes to literally swipe our cards and turn my mood sour, we were turned over to wait on the side for someone to actually put the passes on our cards.
Julie walks out and is useless. She just stands there and asks some questions regarding an administrator key or card and also tells us to wait.
20 minutes later a man walks out and helps out with the line that has developed, the asian guy now helping us asks him something and he brushes him off.

after another 10-15 minutes of just standing there turns out the guy that walked out was the one with the key needed to work the ONE computer they have that can add the passes onto our cards.
Their counter was fully stocked of useless employees, he could have taken a second when he walked out to help us and another pair of people waiting to get passes loaded before helping with the line, but that would only make them useful.

The room is a standard vegas hotel room, none of them are bad, this one is pretty modern.
I'd still prefer to stay at caesars where the service is phenomenal and have various pools to lounge it.
DON'T COME HERE FOR ANY SERVICE.
It's also one of the buffet's worth skipping.",1,0,0

When I proceeded to show them the confirmation email I was told it didn't matter what room u book , that it doesn't mean you are getting the room you paid for???? What? Than why does anyone pay more for a nice room. so our only option was a king smoking room or a queen nonsmoking  room in the unrestored part of the hotel however we would not get the difference in money back!! Than we were told that they would save the room we did book for us for the next day just to return to the concierge. we didn't want to stay in a smoking room so a good amount of my money went to waste. Than the room was missing furniture that had been pulled out of the wall, nails sticking out of the walls and on the floor, the blinds were filthy and wouldn't even work, there was small pieces of trash scatters around the floor as if It was never vaccumed. The next day they still had NO rooms available that we had booked? Why does anyone pay more for a nice room if your just going to give us ur shitty room anyways and not return the difference in money???? The manager did not seem to care and I was too nice to continue complaining as there were others also waiting to speak to the manager. So we dealt  with our shitty disgusting room and ate the money we lost. As we were finally leaving the room we ran into another older couple that were so angry about their room and turns out the same situation had happend to them and their room was as bad as our. We all agreed we will NEVER return! They sure know how to scam ppl out of their money!(at least that couple received no service fees for the nights they stayed, after complaing for hours lol) So sadend this is how my boyfriend had to spend his birthday. He also stays here all the time as he travels to vegas for all sorts of conventions for work, and he never has had this sort of service and usually gets free upgrades when they wanted to charge me 150 more a night! But since it wasn't his name on the card they felt it was okay to shit all over us. Now he and his colleges will never stay there again after the service he witnessed I received and other familys and couples. if you DO decide to stay here I recommend you book the cheapest room as that is what you're going to receive anyways and you'll lose the extra money you put in for a nicer room.

Room service was not overly expensive and very prompt. I called downstairs at 3a.m. for toothpaste and within 5 minutes I had a knock on the door from a bellman. Very fast response time. As I usually do in any hotel I asked for a later check out and was promptly granted a 1:00 time. We didnt actually leave the room until after 2 pm without a hassle.

Non-smoking rooms were quite scarce at the time and we needed two when only one was available.  We ended up upgrading one of our rooms for an extra $50\/night in order to get another non-smoking room.   (BTW the lady at the front desk didn't even think to suggest that to us.  I had to ask)  That part didn't  bother me too much since they told me that smoking\/non-smoking is not guaranteed when I made the reservation.  

What did bother me was that neither room had been cleaned yet! They told me that it wouldn't take too long to get them ready and to come back around 7.   Guess what?  The first room wasn't released to us until 8PM and the second room (that we paid an extra $50\/night for)  wasn't issued to us until 10PM.  To top it off the they admitted that they hadn't finished cleaning the room (after nearly 4 hours of waiting!) but since we had waited so long, they just re-assigned us to an identical room on a different non-smoking floor.  That was probably the worst part of our experience.  At least the rooms were clean enough and once we got past that horrible first day, our stay was ok.

The parking structure is kind of far but I found out that if you exit the hotel from the lobby floor and turn left, walk for a few minutes and go past the tour bus pickup area, you can get to the parking lot elevators in a few minutes.  That was much easier than exiting the casino and going halfway around the Miracle Mile to get to the same parking elevators.  

Oh yeah, I called the front desk on 3 separate occasions during our stay.  A live person never answered the phone.  I was on hold for about 10 minutes once.

It's smack in the middle of the action and you have the Miracle Mile Shops. The crowd is young -- the average age is probably 30 or less, which is perfect for me. 

Here's a tip (literally): try the $20 tip trick (google it if you don't know what it is). We paid for the cheapest room (Hollywood Hip room) and ended up with a corner Resort Room with a strip view and the tub overlooking the Bellagio fountains on the 19th floor. That would have costed us $200-$300 more. I'd say it's worth it, but try to find the front desk agent that's the most easy-going so that you don't fail with the upgrade attempt.

About the room itself:
Planet Hollywood is the old Aladdin Hotel and Casino. You can still see the the signs of it with the ""magic lamp"" faucets in the bathrooms. The bed is comfortable and the room is simple but nice. As far as rates are concerned, they vary day to day. From my experience, they were cheap (under $100\/night) about 2 months before your check-in date, and then they slowly start going up each day all the way until the 48-hour cancellation period, where they then start having $79\/night specials (which made me mad because I couldn't cancel my old reservation and rebook it). I used Kayak.com to book the rooms.

The machines seemed a little tight, like most on-the-strip hotels. The poker room is laid-back with very little sharks. The rake is a little high ($5\/hand) but they do have a high-hand jackpot for quads or higher (I hit a 4-of-a-kind, which is $50. No complaints from me). Waitresses and the Pleasure Pit dealers wear the skimpiest outifts. Guys, you will like. LOL

The bathroom was as bad as rest of the room. The floor hadn't been mopped in weeks (at least) as evidenced by the mildewed grout lines, so to be safe I was sure to shuffle around on a towel rather than allow my feet to touch the floor.

There were splatters on the wall, cobwebs - complete with dead gnats - in the corners, and the window shade was broken and water stained. This was probably a nice hotel 10 years ago, but now it's just the red-headed stepchild of the better hotels. If you're a business traveler like me, you do NOT want to stay at this hotel, nor do you want to bring clients here. It's really for the under 25 crowd that's out to drink, have fun on the Strip and not stay in their rooms for any extended period of time. I felt downright scuzzy the whole time I was there, and couldn't wait to get home and take a long, hot ""Silkwood"" shower (if you've seen the movie, you get it).

Next door to me was an obnoxious group of people who snuck a dog into their room. Between the loud arguments and the dog barking, it was tough to get any decent sleep. Down the hall was another stellar group, who took the fighting to a whole new level, spilling out into the hallway at 2am telling each other to f* off. Round the clock fun for all.

Do the Strip a favor and bulldoze this place!",3,0,0

Called Vegas.com and originally said they could not change it but later did. When we arrived at the hotel, we found out that it was still one king bed; however, the front desk was able to change it for us. Afterwards, he told us about an upgrade for $250 to the Panorama suite, at the time we decided against. 

However, the mattresses of the room had very bad quality springs so we went downstairs to do an upgrade. Now a different front desk agent told us it was a $350 upgrade instead and that was the best they can do; we asked for the original agent who said about the $250 but it took almost 10min to find him, at the end who didn't even show up and just had the other agent tell us that it was only ""part of the room"" that was a $250 upgrade. 

We finally decided to finally do an upgrade to the ""full room"" for $300 extra. We went up to the room, only to find out that the living room TV was broken, as well as a few of the lights. It seemed like nobody's rented the room in a while. Then, we literally stayed and slept in the room for less than 4 hours and did an express check-out the following day. A day later, we discovered that our credit card was charged an extra $864 dollars. We called Planet Hollywood and waited for almost 30 minutes, was redirected from the front desk to the manager, then to the security, to find out that we had ""damaged the mattress,"" which most likely could have been caused by the previous renter provided that so many things either did not work or was unsatisfactory. The security told us the manager is not available at the moment and gave us a ""risk management"" number to call at 9:30am in the morning. We later found out, of course, it was a random lady's number. 

They did not intend to deal with us at all, nor did they inform us anything before charging our credit card for this uncalled fee. Needless to say, we will NEVER be staying at this hotel again and recommend anyone against doing an upgrade if you already have a room.",2,1,0

NO Fridge, NO Microwave, NO Water Bottles and Obviously no goodies i.e. candy, alcohol, soda etc. Cause there's NO FRIDGE.  I felt that downed a star for me already. THEN, looking at all the furniture... it was scratched up, dented and a bit dirty for my taste.  I do not like.  Next thing... There's 2 beds, thus that means that this hotel room is made for more than one person.. yes?  Well.. I was sharing it with a co-worker for a tradeshow and did not use the restroom once.  The restroom is has 2 doors.  The French doors that opens and closes the powder room and the bath tub ( which I liked) and with a shower. By the Shower... there's a door which opens to this very very small bathroom stall.. and NO VENTS, NO WINDOWS NO NOTHING.... And talk about NO sound proofs doors.  I don't want anybody hearing my business... I was able to hear all the room showers near my room.  Literally every time I would come back into the room.. I would here showers, toilet bowls flush.

The suite was aesthetically pleasing and probably one of the better suites we've stayed at in Vegas.  It had a neat projector, leather couches, kitchen, beautifully designed rooms and lovely decor as you'd expect from any suite in Vegas, etc.  This was definitely a place for the younger crowd to stay, with many peeps in their 20s and 30s.  

We got a free cabana at the pool that came w\/ our suite which I believe was normally a $300 value.  It was pretty darn small, though, and one of the uglier pools I've been to in Vegas, but I don't swim often so it wasn't too much of a big deal to me.  I liked how the stores (and the Fat Tuesday bar) were extremely close to our room.  Very convenient.  

I like Planet Hollywood overall, but there were a few problems w\/ our room that I'm not sure I want to even mention here, but screw it:

-  When we first checked into our room, it looked like it wasn't even cleaned... and we're pretty POSITIVE that not much effort was put into it especially when we found nasty things in the drawers which I won't mention.  Private message me if you'd like to know what we found, lol.  Needless to say, it gave us a dirty feeling and we didn't want to stay there, and so we demanded to be transferred to another suite.

-  The new room we transferred to was definitely a lot cleaner, but what do ya know... we found yet another nasty thing which I wont mention in another drawer.  So yeah, something tells me that they're either understaffed when it comes to cleaning rooms, or their staff just doesn't do a good job.

Overall a great hotel to stay!  :-P",3,2,1

The casino is loud. There were often 3 songs playing at once which can be jarring to your ears. It definitely caters to the young crowd but I saw a good mix of ages and groups. You have to understand what you are getting...center strip property, young uns', pounding music, and sometimes huge crowds that flood the areas. Everything is on site including food, shopping, scantily clad pleasure pit girls, and more shopping. 

The room was very stripped down mod. It was definitely not the intricate and eclectic martini mod you may see in Palm Springs or even the contemporary interpretation at the Linq. My guess is that this invites a lot of criticism from patrons expecting more. The look is graphic but subdued with browns and whites. The casino floor is much more elaborate with Victoria Secret's-like monochromatic pillars, sculpted ceilings, lots of crystal, and light installations that alternate colors. It reminds me of a scaled down Cosmopolitan mixed with the classic look of Palm's Place. 

The bathroom was nearly 1\/2 of our room which is a dream if you are someone who loves to preen and primp. Double doors open to a huge space with separate showers, bathtub, compartmentalized toilet, and double vanities. This is definitely Hollywood. The only downside is that this takes from the living space in the main room so you and numerous friends won't be able to share a small room comfortably. As for the main living space, the furniture was not only stylish but very comfortable with seats you can sink into. Not much else to write home about but what's not to like? 

The Wi-Fi was weak most the time but they do offer a wired Ethernet connection. The pool is on the 6th floor and may be dirty. You have your choice of two pools on either side. They are warmed and shallow, only 4 foot deep at the most. They are actually spaced very far apart so you might miss the other pool if you aren't exploring. There is a huge courtyard for sunbathing if you aren't up for a dip. 

All in all, not a bad experience. Everyone was so sweet to us and I had a great time. The most memorable part of the trip was the 110 degree F weather. Too hot to complain but there wasn't much to complain about at Planet Hollywood. Some reviewers are geared up to totally trash this property in review but you have to experience it to make this determination. The centralized location on the strip makes exploring easy should the casino or amenities leave you wanting more. This is not a new property, like the Linq or Aria, so it will show it's age. The upside is never once did I feel like management let an aspect of our experience slide or degrade.  

Tip: Valet will take you straight to the direct entrance and check-in and there are elevators near the Starbucks to your right that will take you to your room.

If you had to self park (as you probably will because valet was so busy when we went) then make your way to the ground floor and make the trek towards the entrance\/valet to avoid the Miracle Mile shops. There are no pedestrian walkways and we were hugging a wall with ventilation ducts at one point. You can avoid the crowds and having to navigate while carrying heavy luggage. This shortcut will take you to and fro should you need to go to your car. Just walk the way you drove in since the cavernous parking structure provides no cues for you.",0,0,0

I suppose my visit was good because a friend of mine comes to Vegas quite often, and she spends a lot at PH to get all of the perks.

We got to check in the VIP area without having to wait in line. The check-in clerk was very nice, and very cute as well. She helped us get our room, because we were in a hurry to get back out because of some arrangements we had going else where.

The room we got was on the 15th floor in the panoramic room. It's basically the corner suite with the living room space covered in windows. 2 bedroom with 3 queen sized beds. One huge bathroom with a shower, hot tub, toilet, bidet, 2 sinks and plenty of room. There was a second bathroom with just a single sink and toilet. The other bathroom was about half the size of the large one. It was very clean and accommodating to our needs.

It's definitely living big here if you're going all out Vegas style. I don't have a clue how much the room cost us, but it was very nice. It had a Grease theme setup with props from the movie displayed in the room.

The Casino level is pretty nice, and like other casinos... smokey :( Let's just say the dry weather and smoke didn't help me in my favor.

The pool on the 6th floor is very nice, and we had a cabana reserved for us. We had Malibu rum and coke and pineapple juice for us to drink. They regularly refilled our mixers and ice and asked when they noticed it looked low. Great service.

We had a fountain view Junior suite on the 21st floor. This hotel had previously been Middle Eastern themed, and all of the fixtures in the room as well as the architectural of the building other than the façade still showed that influence. The only concession the hotel made inside the room towards its name where a couple of scattered ""movie memorabilia"" pieces. To be perfectly honest, a leather jacket that was possibly may be worn by somebody in a movie made 60 years ago was less fun to see on the wall then perhaps an actual painting. Hell, or even just a better color than the sandstone that was everywhere. The bathroom was also infuriatingly unlit with the actual switches nowhere near the toilet at all. Let me tell you how fun this was drunk at three in the morning. We did appreciate the quick walk from check-in to room and then from room to the strip. This is a much more compact hotel than others in the area.

The casino itself is geared to a younger crowd, perhaps, than some of the other casinos on the strip (or at least it seemed that way to me). Aside from the stripper-esque ""Pleasure Pit"" dancers, the crowd in general seemed younger and the music that was being played early in the morning was extremely clublike. There is, in fact, an actual dance club somewhere on the premise, I do believe that it is connected to the casino directly, but I never went. The hotel and casino is also directly connected to a reasonably large mall of course, and is pretty much directly across the street from the Bellagio fountains, which is a huge plus.

They were still transitioning and adding onto it when I left and when I came about almost a year later it was Planet Hollywood.  One of the newest hotels on the strip.   

Got a small about of blackjack done before entering into club Prive right on the casino floor.  Had one of the most memorable experiences on the Casino floor that night when I met two really cute Asian girls from LA here.  Later found out that night that they were part of a bachelorette party.  One of their friends was getting married apparently, anyways that was super fun to meet some hot girls and party with them all night.

I can be served the wrong meal and not say a word about it to the waiter. The only reason I give this hotel 2 stars is because the shops, the food, location and the view was great. I've been visiting Las Vegas and staying in the hotels since I was a kid and this was absolutely my worst experience. It seems every time my husband and I tried to let someone know, no one cared. Out of 5 people we spoke to, only 1 woman at the front desk actually tried to help us and apologized for our experience.

It all started with reserving the room. Tried to get the deal they had on the website and the website wouldn't process it. My husband called and spoke to a manager, but they wouldn't honor the web discount. Finally, she tells my husband to send her a snapshot of the price online was charging. He does and waits for her to call us back. Two hours later, he called them back, spoke to a man who did everything and let us keep the online deal... All within 5 minutes. I work in customer service and just don't understand why no one called us back or why this guy let us get our deal when she (the manager) wouldn't. 

Anyway, moving on..  Parking is far and not easy to find, the casino is confusing and hard to navigate the first time around. Our room was advertised as a ""premium fountain view room"". They also advertise a ""fountain view room"". Thinking we had a larger room with two chairs (as pictured on the website), we were disappointed, but we decided to make the best of it and move on. When we called the front desk... They confirmed that premium fountain view and fountain view were the same rooms. Oh yeah.. We also noticed that a few of our needed light fixtures were broken. Now we get to the moths. Do NOT open your window vents at night. We had about 5 in our room every day as soon as we opened them.  But the cake topper was getting stuck in the elevator for 10 minutes.. It jolted and stopped and we had to talk to someone to help get us out. After that, I can officially say I'll never stay, or recommend staying there again.",1,0,1

When our check in finally came PH did not have my room available. We needed to have two queens non smoking and told our options were limited. We ended up getting the resort room over looking the pool on the 10th floor. 
Not a bad room and it was pretty big. To compensate us at check in they gave us spa discounts and peep show 10.00 off (which BTW were worthless)

Pool: The pool at PH is BADDD I mean for here in Maryland the pool would have sufficed but this is Vegas... The only good chairs you had to pay 25-50. When we tried to lay out in the crappy free ones we were treated like second class citizens. Went over to the Hard Rock pool and they treated us much better and we were not even staying there. 

Maid Service: We never got any for FIVE days. I complained and they still never showed up 

Location: The reason I gave two stars. GREAT location on the strip. 

All in all it is a fun hotel the casino rocks and it is happening with a good crowd on Friday and sat night. But the hotel is not good. They really need to make changes if anyone is going to stay and come back. I sure won't......",0,0,0

I've been to Vegas a lot and I thought this was one of the better hotels.

PH has pretty much the best when it comes to location and what they offer. Numerous dining options, shops and as well as just being in the middle means you could pretty much walk everywhere conveniently.  I'm a loyal TR member so Planet Hollywood or Caesars would be the ideal choice for me, but when you compare the price difference I can't justify paying more to stay at Caesars when the room setups are basically the same.

I checked into PH and did the sandwich trick. I had two rooms so I slipped a $50 between my ID and card. I was given numerous options for my room choices in terms or floor, views, etc and was upgraded to the resort room over the regular standard room I had originally booked.

It was very spacious and I was pleased with the room. Nothing fancy as I expected but the beds were comfy and the bathroom had a nice tub and shower. 

There really is no downside to this place except for not really having any major clubs. Lots of bars but none appealing. All the dining options are good, shopping, and most of all location. Didn't have a chance to use the pool but from the pictures it looked pretty standard.",2,1,0

Pros:
We found it super fast. Very great location right on the strip. 
the overall appearance was nice.
Check-in time was fast. They had many people working. 
We got a room in the 27th floor. Over looking the pool & strip (really nice) 
Room was spacious & clean. 

Cons:
The parking! Ughh, probably it was our fault by not knowing. But we took like an 1hr to find parking and when we found one, we didnt know where to go. 
(Who knew you had to walk the mile shops before getting to the resort and casino?WE didnt!) such a hassle. 
& the room furniture was a little outdated  
& not enough sitting area around pool. We had to keep an eye out all the time to get a chair by the pool.

I've given three stars primarily because our experience with the staff was subpar, but also the décor is so dated. We were treated rudely by bar staff, indifferently by staff at the spa, and ignored by the maid staff. 

We ordered two waters at the bar and the waitress barked back that we had to order drinks in order to sit down. Of course we were going to get drinks, we were just parched and wanted water first. 

The spa staff was not friendly, like we are used to at other resorts. I think it's because a 20% gratuity is already included. They took it for granted. 

On two occasions the maids promised to come clean our room, once at noon, and then at 5pm. They showed up at 11:30pm, and woke us up. Lame.

The atmosphere is really lively, but it was really crowded during the day. But then again, the Miss USA pageant was going on and the contestants were everywhere. I actually saw Miss Massachusetts get off the elevator as well as Miss Iowa Teen USA. 

Sometimes you will see celebrities here also... my mom actually met Kelly Osbourne in the casino and got a pic with her and Jesse Tyler Ferguson from Modern Family was walking around a few months ago when I went. Too bad I missed both sightings!

The hotel room we stayed in was pretty comfortable. The beds are comfy, but the rooms could use a little more lighting. But then again, that is Hollywood style.

One of the reasons I love PH is because it has a mall, Miracle Mile Shops, attached to it and there's shops, bars, and restaurants affordable for the rich and common folk alike.

The shower was good size and plenty of hot water for my room in the 2270's range of rooms. The TV was not that great even though it was a large flat screen the connection and video quality was horrible. It was closer to a TV with an antenna. 

The ice machine was great. Clean ice and always had plenty of ice as I tend to use a lot this was useful.

The view from my room was nice and was able to see the other hotels and lights at night. 

The hotel staff were always helpful and friendly. 

There are places to eat all hours of the night and the PH convenience store is 24 hours and had almost anything you could need. 

The casino does not have any low min tables to play like some of the casinos down the strip into the old town part of Vegas. 

The valet service takes about 30 min to get your vehicle and they do not have call down service. You will need to physically show up for your car. I suspect this is to keep traffic moving and cars just sitting there waiting on guests. It's a busy area so this kinda makes sense. You just need to plan ahead for this. There is also often a sign saying valet full. You need to look closely it also states hotel guests only. So if your staying just go on through and your good to go.

We got our rooms at a reasonable price thanks to one of our co-workers who had status with the hotel.

It has an awesome casino vibe, plenty of shops, great rooms, and I hear good food although I actually didn't try the food in Planet Hollywood.

The casino floor is quite a bit nicer than say Ballys or any of the other older casinos. And I think it has a much better vibe than Paris or Cosmo (next door\/across the street). Plenty of tables although usually they're $10 not $5 tables. I found the dealers to be a pretty enjoyable group of people and never had issues. 

But the hotel's the best part. The rooms are large and the beds are very comfy. Even the standard rooms are quite spacious, but upgrade to the next tier and the rooms are very large with massive bathrooms - bathrooms so big they carpet part of the floor. 
I stayed at Planet Hollywood a number of times and the only time I had an issue - I got back from work (yes, actually work) at 3am only to find I was locked out of my room due to some issue with the pipes (it affected a couple rooms near me as well). So I had to go downstairs, figure out the issue, go back upstairs, get my stuff, go to some other room all after working for like 20 hours that day. Not happy.

I'm part of the promotional team behind a custom knife show that happens every Labor Day Weekend at this hotel. PH had been so good to us over the years that I decided to stay here while I was in Vegas for the SHOT Show and UFC Fights.

Unfortunately my last stay was not so pleasant.

I was sent an email allowing me to check in online. I clicked the link and was told I would receive a text when I checked in. I got it before I boarded the plane. Pretty cool, huh?

Wait it gets worse.

The email told me to go to the ""Key Desk"" to pick up my keys. I disembarked the airport shuttle with some other people and went to the Key Desk. The desk jockey was talking to some idiot couple who were checking in like they were at the Registration Desk. I thought this was supposed to be an express check-in deal? Whatever.

Twenty five minutes later the people who rode with me were happily walking to their rooms while I was still waiting for this moron to tell these assholes from Iowa how to flush a toilet.

When he finally got to me, I was done in less than 3 minutes. As I walked away he called over the next person in line from registration. I shook my head in disgust wondering why they would have someone like this manning the express ""Key Desk"".

The weekend was over, I received my bill. These assholes charged me $22.40 for this ""convenience"" and refused to reverse the charges.

It was an amazing show with about ten different high profile acts that came to help Justin raise money for the Shiners.  Leona Lewis, Boys to Men, the Johnas brothers, the under my umbrella-please don't stop the music pop diva from Barbados (I can't think of her name.. oh yes Rihanna), and even Lionel Richie showed up to do a few songs before Justin did a full concert.

The lighting and acoustics were amazing and I only had to take the elevator downstairs from the North tower and walk through the circle bar to get to it!  

I like the spa and fitness area here too.  It helps me sweat out the toxins and fight off the fat that comes from enjoying all the great restaurants that are near and part of the millennium mile complex.  The pool area is massive and fun.  The price is usually pretty good.  I usually stay in decent sized standard deluxe room here and it is fine.  This time I crashed a party down the hall in one of the hospitality suites.  It was fantastic.  Amazing views of the Paris Eiffel tower and the Bellaggio water show and of course free food and drink from my would-be hosts!  I would love to be able to stay in one of these suites one day.. maybe if I hit the jack pot during my next trip.
I love you, Planet Hollywood!",1,0,0

Planet Hollywood is like a con man that runs at you, kicks you down and takes your money.  It starts at the parking lot, oo, did you miss that small sign that says ""planet hollywood?"" , then you trek through the Mile long mall where you walk and walk and walk..to check in.  After you check in there's a guy at the elevator, you think he's security, but he's not, guess what he's selling a time share, just tell greasy haired sales guy, that you're leaving Vegas at 8am in the morning and they'll leave you alone.  
I'm in sales and they're just an embarrassment, I'd tell the guy he should pick up a copy of Glengarry Glenn Ross movie, but don't think he would take the hint.

You get to the room, not bad until you realize..no coffee, water is $5 a bottle and you each get 1 towel, nothing more nothing less, I'm guessing if you asked for another one they'd charge you for it.  

Slots are unforgiving, nothing exciting, if you're really into gambling then most people go to old town fremont area anyway, so I can't blame Planet Hollywood there.  Waitresses are few, if you ask for a drink you may get one, then wait 30 min for another one, best to go to other casinos that serve faster.

Oh here's a warning for you, the V show?  Save your $, for $20 more you can see Cirque De Soleil (sic), the show area consists of a make shift room with chairs similar to those you'd find in a picnic, and a stage the size of my bathroom back home.   Big rip off, oh and they were trying to take pictures and charge you for them, first sign of a real scam.

This is the first Casino I've seen where they really live up to the name, If you've ever been to Hollywood, it's a town full of beggars, not a pleasant or safe place at night and a prime spot for a mugg'n, so anyway I'd avoid this place, even Palace Station would be a better choice.",3,2,2

We got the mid-level corner room but only got to stay on the 8th floor, and no plasma TV but we did have one TV in the main room and another TV by the 2-person bath tub. 

As far as rooms go it was comfortable and relatively spacious.  But since we were also paying for a view I was disappointed that all we got was a boring pool area and cranes building a new hotel across the street. 

PH is trying to be the latest, hippest, trendy, posh, ""beautiful people"" spot on the strip.  It's one big club 24\/7 on the casino floor - constant, never ending thumping club music, colorful but dim lighting, loud crowds, and dancing girls in lingerie on podiums all around you.  The Heart Bar is smack dab in the middle for a reason.  There is always a crowd there, even at 7, 8 and 9am - we weren't sure if they had just started partying but most likely had been going at it all night.    

The TV channels sucked, there were about 4-5 channels exclusively advertising PH.  But the bed was very comfortable and not overly silky\/posh. Other Yelpers have noted the location and the room amenities. My only other comments are that the marble bathroom floor is friggen cold and the heater\/air conditioner can't maintain ""warm"" at night, only blows hot for 10 minutes then cold for 10 minutes, each time with a loud ""click"" whenever it changes over.

But nice is that the rooms are designed so that you don't hear loud TV's from other rooms or other loud noises (yeah baby).  

Basically it seemed that this is currently the place to see and be seen - even early in the morning.  But we're not one of ""the beautiful people"" so we were just happy to have enjoyed a nice room in a great location on the LV strip.",2,2,1

However, it always feels like a bit of a balancing act.  Cosmo and Aria are usually our preferred spots, as well as The Bellagio to a lesser extent, but none of them are all that cheap.  And while Paris and Bally's are far more wallet friendly, their rooms are pretty dated (especially the latter).  Oddly though, we never looked into staying at Planet Hollywood.  After this trip though, that just might start to change!

Since my buddy and I decided to book our trip to watch the NBA Summer League just days in advance, we kind of resigned ourselves to some pricey hotel rates.  Cosmo's rates were around  $500\/night and Aria and Bellagio weren't far behind.  Seeing that Planet Hollywood was just a shade higher than Paris and Bally's at about $90\/night, we decided to take a chance on something new.  Turns out, it was the best bet of our trip!

Considering the price point, we were pleasantly surprised with how nice and spacious our room was.  It definitely can't compete with the newer rooms and modern\/trendy amenities that Cosmo and Aria have to offer, but all of the basics were accounted for - toiletries, hair dryer, ironing board, safe, mini fridge, etc.  What's more, the beds were comfortable and plush, the wi-fi was decent (though it crapped out on us a few times), and the bases of the lamps were fitted with both electrical plugs and USB outlets, which made charging multiple devices at a time a breeze.

As far as the rest of the hotel goes, it's pretty solid.  We didn't explore the entire hotel, but they do have spa facilities, a pool\/pool parties, solid food options (Starbucks in the casino, Koi, GR Burger, Earl of Sandwich, etc.), a 24-hr ""gift shop"", the neighboring Miracle Mile Shops, a Walgreen's and McDonald's right outside, and Britney's got her show here (hey, Brit!).  Plus, it's right across the street from Cosmo and a very short walk away from Aria, Paris, and Bellagio.

If there was something I truly hated about PH though, it'd be with the layout of their casino.  I get that they're generally designed to keep you in, but I don't get why I always end up walking in the wrong direction unless I do an entire lap around the floor to figure out where I want to go.  I swear it's like being in Mazerunner!  Maybe it's also because I don't really gamble much here.  Not that the table rates are super high; just that we always end up at Cosmo or Paris instead.

Between how nice the hotel is and the fact that we always end up spending a decent amount of time there, Cosmo still reigns supreme for me (and Aria, to a lesser degree).  However, when factoring in the rates with the quality of the rooms and their awesome location, there's no denying that Planet Hollywood is not only a better value, but one of the best values on The Strip.",13,10,10

Right now it is 11:19 pm, I am here for a convention, so not by choice. I have my wife and 4 year old grand daughter with me. The noise in my room is at a peak of  83 decibels from the concert across at the Cosmopolitan. 

I paid 185 for a Jr. Suite with a view of the fountains at the Bellagio. No one told us, warned us, or hinted at the noise. Called the desk, no help, no concern, they got there money and that seems to be their only concern.

Called the police, not about the pool party but the noise level, we are across the strip, 21 floors up and again a max decibel of 83. Somebody at the county must have well lined pockets to allow this night after night. Shame on you.

Stay away, if you expect to get any sleep. This is Tuesday night, was the same on Sunday, quiet Monday. It is getting louder.

NAC 484.150 Noise emission standards for operators of vehicles. (NRS 484.6101)

1. No person may operate either a motor vehicle or combination of vehicles of a type subject to registration at any time or under any condition of grade, load, acceleration or deceleration in such a manner as to exceed the following noise limit for the category of motor vehicle based on a distance of 50 feet from the center of the lane of travel within the speed limits specified in this subsection:

Speed Limit of 35 mph or of Less ..... 86 dBA

Speed Limit of More Than 35 mph.... 90 dBA

God forbid I have a loud car!  BUT IT IS OK TO BE JUST ABOUT THAT LOUD IN MY ROOM!

Also in Nevada construction standards say the walls of a structure must attenuate the sound at least 20 decibels. So factoring the lowest legal attenuation the noise out side must be at least 103 decibels.

So do not drive by the cosmopolitan on a loud bike, or you could get a ticket.

I have an idea. To prevent this, get a room at planet Hollywood, bring your bike up, rev it all you want it is OK with the staff and yes, no ticket, actually no one will hear it above the noise in the room.

Since we weren't club members, we had to pay for valet, which was $38 for 2 nights!

11 of us tried to check in early, but our rooms weren't ready, so we were directed to stash our bags with the bell hop outside --- no fee. [ they work for tips only ]. this was pretty stellar considering that we wanted to enjoy the sun as soon as possible and not have to lug our flat irons and underwear around. about 2 hours later, still earlier than the usual check in time, we were able to get our rooms and have them all close together, as we had requested. with our stay, we got a free bottle of liquor. when you check in, they give you a voucher and you take it to the gift shop and choose from a small list.... not too shabby. cruzan rum, it is. thanks, ph. this drink's on you.
each room has its own theme. back to the future, malibu shores, troope beverly hills.  each had two queen beds, a flat screen tv, a desk, rolling chair, a small side table and another small captain's chair.  the lighting was awful. it only had a lamp on the desk and a small one between the beds. the lights that were supposed to encase the posters on the wall and the side table did not work. do you not want me to see the crappy popcorn ceiling? the bathroom had no locks whatsoever. the toilet was encased in its own room, which also had no locks. there are also no vents. it didn't make much difference to me because everyone knows that my sh*t smells like roses, but the guys cared. so if it matters to you. maybe you should stay elsewhere. however, your lady friend might try to get you to stay here because it has a separate stand up shower and nice soak tub. 
we forgot our toothpaste, so i had to use the phone and call guest services. the phone has all these specialized buttons to call specific departments, but none of them effin work. USELESS. just dial 0 and listen to the endless myriad of options before you get what you want. anyway, to my surprise, i got my toothpaste rather quickly and 2 complimentary toothbrushes. BUT, the next day, i called for towels and NEVER got them. i had to canoodle some from a housekeeping cart. 
maybe what's more important is mongo surprised us with a bottle of jack and a plate of apples and peanut butter. apparently, he called the hotel and took care of everything from back home. when i walked in, there was a room service cart set up that took me aback.  there was even an envelope with my name on it with a card and everything.  so at least, they didn't mess that up.
there's two pools. but the actual space around each pool is extremely limited. so chances are that you'll actually be sunbathing in a 'tanning lot'. can't bring alcohol to the pool because they want you to buy theirs. damn the man!

miracle mile shops are ph's answer to caesar's palace forum shops.... just not as high falutin. so i can dig it.

I am a registered guest who checked in on Saturday 6\/27\/15 and checked out the following morning.  Honestly, I was actually looking for a room at Elara where my friends were, but I only settled with PH because they're connected and Elara was completely booked.  This was not my first time at PH, but let me explain why it will be my last.  

Have you ever seen the movie White Chicks with the Wayans brothers?  Think back to that part where they check in the hotel and they are ""Soooo frickin pissed!"" that they're ""gonna write a letter"" and have a ""BF!""  That's exactly how I felt there and again now as I write this.

Well, to start things off parking was a huge hassle since valet parking was full.  This was no one's fault--just a busy weekend.  At least we were able to get the bellboy to take our bags up for us right?  Wrong.  I was so happy to not have to carry all our things up until I saw how our things were brought up.  We had bought a couple gallons of water to drink for the weekend, and one of the big bottles had gotten damaged somehow that it leaked all over our belongings.  Of course my stuff was on top protecting everyone else's bags.  I did not have a single dry piece of clothing.  When I took everything out of my duffle bag there was a huge pool of water at the bottom.  When the bellboy realized how badly he had messed up with my stuff he offered to bring back some extra towels.  He brought back two small towels.  What did he expect me to do?  Spend all weekend dabbing my clothes dry?!  I proceeded to attempt to use the phone to call the front desk and request some kind of laundry service to dry my clothes.  I used the word ""attempt"" because the buttons on the phone didn't work.  I was so tired from the drive and all the walking around that I didn't want to go all the way back down to complain.  I was not about to let this ruin my weekend in Vegas.   So, I just started to hang my clothes everywhere and use a pathetic little blow dryer to dry what I needed for that day.   

My friends and I decided to make use of our time by heading down to the pool.  Might as well go swimming since our swimsuits were already wet right?  When we got on the pool floor some employees were shooing us away because the pool had been soiled and was closed for the day.  I think we would have had better luck swimming around in my duffle bag of water!  We went back up to the room only to find that our room key did not work anymore.  So now we had to go down again just to get a working room key. 

By this time it's late and our group had arrived at Elara and PH so we started to get ready to go out for the night.  I'm the last one ready because my friend and I are still desperately still trying to blow dry my clothes.  By this time I'm tired of being so passive about things so I walk all the way down to at the VERY LEAST request for a late checkout in the morning.  I told the desk person everything that's happened, and all I wanted was a late checkout.  He said, ""I'm sorry about that.  I'll give you an extra hour.""  SERIOUSLY?  And if I wanted an even later check out I would have to call the desk in the morning around 7 AM.  How did they expect me to call when I told them that the phone did not work?

So the next day my friend and I went our separate ways since I was going to stay an extra night at a different hotel.  I was at Encore when I received word from him that he was having a hard time getting his car from the valet because it turns out that the maid threw away the ticket.  There are certain things that you find and DON'T throw away.  A valet ticket is one of those things.  My poor friend had to hassle with the car valet stuff when he could have been with everyone else at beach club.  

Normally I leave Vegas feeling like I wanted to stay another night or go to one more club.  Never, ever have I been so happy to check out and go home.  

I feel like a number of things were messed up from beginning to end and the staff at here Planet Hollywood did nothing to accommodate for our time wasted here.  Paying customers are obviously not a priority at this hotel.  They don't care to accommodate and barely even apologize for our inconveniences and frustration.  I would never let anyone I care about go Vegas and stay at Planet Hollywood.  Why stay here when there are so many options?

I called the front desk to complain (it took about 15 minutes to even get through) and they said they couldn't give us another room, but could send someone up to spray it. Well, that never happened. The room smelled like weed all weekend because the room next to us was blowing it into our bathroom vent. We called again to complain Friday night that it was an issue, so the hotel comped our $16 early check in fee (something I feel we shouldn't have been charged in the first place) and sent Security up to look into it. Nevertheless, every night weed blew into our vents and smelled up our room. Planet Hollywood's inability to remedy the situation left a bad taste in my mouth. On top of that, the rooms are really so-so, almost outdated even. I was surprised that they didn't have iPod docks as most hotels do these days. Another thing that was super annoying was how bad the water pressure was in the shower, it was so light that my showers weren't even pleasant. All the water pressure went to the sink faucet instead, causing water to splash everywhere every time you turned it on.  I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Vegas over the past 14 years (Wynn, MGM, Paris, Hard Rock) and this is by far the worst room I've stayed in. There are better hotels for the same price or less. All Planet Hollywood has going for it is a great location on the strip.",1,0,0

I'd consider it towards the middle of the road in comparison to the other Vegas hotels. Not great, but definitely not bad. Our room was clean, modern, and although we didn't spend much time there it was satisfactory. Again, nothing incredible but no reason to complain. My one complaint is the resort fee that is charged at the end of your stay. I get that nearly all Vegas resorts charge these but when you come in the winter and can't utilize the pool I was essentially charged $35 a day for nothing besides wifi use. As I said, nearly every hotel and resort charges these fees but it's still robbery once you consider what they charge you for the room already.",0,0,0

Earlier in the afternoon of the day we checked in, I called to make sure what we were getting. A girl told me I was booked for Ultra Hip. Once we actually got there, we wound up with a luxury resort room (not Ultra Hip) on the 9th floor. It was very spacious and had a view of the strip, but it was older, darker, and smelled weird. Meh...

The next morning, we heard construction noises at 8am -__- I called front desk and they moved us to an Ultra Hip room (woohoo finally) on the 28th floor. We really liked this room!

the rooms were pretty coo but the hallways were dirty. u would think that in 3 days of being in vegas that at leaste 1 of the hundreds of housekeepers could pick up the cigarettes on the ground in the hall. i called to make a reservation on the phone and got a really good deal. i got a bottle of liquor each night (and no not those little pieces of shit bottles the real thing) but here is the catch..they dont give u chasers so u have to buys those on ur own. we were able to take the bottle around with us and had a great time. the bathroom was big and we could fit a few girls in there getting ready. the shower was a clear glass door so i got to see all my friends goodies (not that i havent seen them before) 

when you book the reservation they charge your card at time of reservations. the line at check in was stupid long at 4 pm on friday which i can understand just make sure that u already have a drink before you check in.

I booked several rooms here for CES and found their phone booking agent to be super pleasant, and when we checked in, the desk agent was accomodating and patient. The person who checked us out must have been new or tired (it was 5am and there was a long line of several people checking out). We were charged for internet access even though it was included in the resort fee. He did take it off, but only after it was pointed out.

Regarding the resort fee, they are standard operating procedure for Vegas hotels. Ceasar's properties used to advertise that they didn't have a fee, but those days are over. I just see it as a very high internet-access fee.

First, the valet services are slow both leaving and getting your car back.  They don't allow you to call down ahead to get the car and you have to wait about 10 minutes on average for it to show up.
When we checked in, the ONLY two bed non-smoking room available was an accessible room.  The only options they offered were to take a smoking room or take this room for the night and switch the next day.  The accessible room had a shower that was basically even with the bathroom floor other than a small 1\/4 inch railing that was covered in mold and allowed the water to cover the entire bathroom floor after a shower since the drain was pretty much clogged.  The whole room smelled like stagnant water and mold.
When we went down the next day around 9am, we were told that we needed to come back at 2pm to get our new room.  When we told them we won't be able to do that, we were told we have to come back and check again at 11am.  This of course was when EVERYONE is checking out so we had to wait in a 20 minute line to get our new keys to the new room.  The new room had a dead lamps and the room overall is REALLY dark with only a small 3 x 3 window in the corner.
One of the days, the maids didn't even bother coming to make up the room.  No new towels, no beds made up, nothing.  They didn't even come in.  When I called down to housekeeping to tell them, their response was brilliantly, ""so......."".
The internet is ridiculously expensive and is charged PER DEVICE, not per room or stay.  They even charge you for use of the fitness center ($25 per person per day) since it ""belongs to the spa"".  What hotel doesn't have a fitness center any more?!?

A Frickin MAZE!!!

I like to start with the positives. 
There's Earl of Sandwich. 
Prices are reasonable (i booked mine from hotel.com)
They have tubs instead of just showers. 

I originally booked a Hollywood Hip room, which was the basic. 
However, when checking in, they showed me that i would be facing the back lot. (ofcourse right?)  I was offered a $20\/per room.\/per night upgrade so i could see the strip and they also found me adjoining rooms, which was good since i was with relatives in two rooms. It was so much more convenient than being separated and plus they got to see the strip. 

MAJOR COMPLAINT= the self parking is hella far from hotel entrance!
My poor grandma and mom had to walk the entire miracle mile as we did not know it would be that far! The rest of the trip, dude and i pretty much was going back and forth to pick them up at the lobby. Took about 12 minutes each way. They have free valet, but we never like to valet in general... bad stories. 

Rooms are not created equally! (in the same category). 
We had adjacent rooms on the 16th floor and there was a few differences we noticed. The room i was NOT sleeping in had noticeably softer beds (must be the beds some yelpers were saying were sooooo comfortable- we didn't get those). My room had the very low water pressure that some guests noted, while the other room had perfectly good water pressure... 

Minor complaints.

Most recent was on 1\/23\/16....strip view, two queen beds, 20th floor.

Check in took almost 30 minutes, after a walk from basically the roof for self-parking.

Room was as-requested, with ""resort access fee"" cost was about $200.00....which is really stupid.  The only reason I booked this room was an event at Caesar's which cost over $300.00 a night and is easily reached after a 10 minute walk.

Carpets are stained, worn and torn in spots.

Elevator(1 of 6) was out of order and stuck open.

Short of the Gordon Ramsey Burger restaurant, choices are played out and expensive or not very good.

While I hate staying here, do enjoy the convenience.  That would be the only reason to chose PH, and probably why I'll stay here again...that said, it is an overblown, expensive and unpleasant accommodation.",10,4,4

Cons: Our room looked cleaned, but the furniture was very outdated (which we really did not care - this is an inexpensive hotel).

4-stars - Hotel Room. We stayed in a newly remodeled Ultra Resort Room. It was super clean and spacious. The only thing I disliked about the room was that it overlooked the pool and while I enjoyed the two-piece eye candy, even the double-pained windows couldn't hold back the boom boom boom of the bass bass bass.

4-stars - Casino. I liked the vibe and variety of games available to play. Most casinos are dead in the middle of the day but this place was jumping.

4-stars - Food. Everything tasted good!

1-star - The Underground. When you pull into the casino to check-in there are signs specifically meant to confuse the sh!t out of you. LAX makes more sense... downtown Tijuana makes more sense... this place doesn't!

1-star - Valet. Don't even think about using the valet on a weekend. The lines are longer than Disneyland.

1-star - Parking. You have to park in Arizona and walk through a ""mile of shops"" to get to your room. By the time you get there, you are too tired to go downstairs and gamble!

1-star - Parking Deck. There are two elevators that go from the mall to the upper levels of the parking structure. Stupid design. There aren't enough elevators and they aren't located in an air conditioned part of the building.

1-star - WiFi. First, it is an unsecured connection (when there is an actual connection). Second, it is unreliable and slow. It's an embarrassment in 2017. Their entire IT department should have their flip phones and PalmPilots taken away.

My group of friends chose the suite in order to live it up for our first time. It included two beds, a kitchen, a hot tub and very spacious accommodations. We played music on the TV and we could listen to our jams as we got ready in the restroom. Our view was great because we could see the rest of the strip and the hustle and bustle of Vegas. 

Planet Hollywood is a great location because it is in the middle of the strip and is right next to the really nice hotels and shops. There is a mall or shopping center within the vicinity so you can do some souvenir shopping, gamble, or even grab a drink at Fat Tuesday. Fat Tuesday and Earl sSandwich are located in the same building so that was the best decision ever since Earls Sandwich is 24 hours. I really think my friends and I chose a prime location where we could really take in the Vegas experience. Despite it being on the Strip, it seems like you will always be taxiing wherever you go even when you are less than a mile away from the club. When you are in heels or it's late at night, you never want to walk back. Lucky for us since PH is in a prime location, the cost wasnt that bad. There are taxis circling in the parking area at PH so that is always convenient.

1) The suite life is pretty awesome. I would definitely recommend it.
2) If the day club is too expensive, there pool area is really nice to lounge around.

Since the Planet Hollywood was unable to do a complete overhaul of the Aladdin, they cut a few cost corners.  For example, my Hollywood-themed room had a genie lamp and some crazy swirly carpet.  Same great price and reliable everything - just painted purple and with giant PH symbols everywhere.

They had nice ashtrays, which Lindsey and I glamorously threw up in on way to the airport the last morning.  See?  PH brought us a little closer to being Hollywood starlets.

We checked in and our package was supposed to come with a free bottle of alcohol, but they said that wasn't our promotion and we got other coupons. I'm pretty sure I booked the right package, but I let it go, it wasn't worth fussing over. I'm Asian, and when we got to our room our theme was.... Enter the Dragon w\/ Bruce Lee. Coincidence? I'll never know...

The room was clean and decent sized. Like other reviews said though, it was kind of dark in there. Planet Hollywood has a pretty good location: middle of the Strip, close to shopping, Earl of Sandwich, Fat Tuesday (both of which I went to every day).

My major problems with this place made the stay not as pleasant. Every morning at 10AM, someone would knock on our door to do a ""room check."" One day they even opened the door because they didn't hear me yell. WTF. Check out time is at 11, and we had just barely woken up. WTH is a room check anyway?? -1 BIG star

Another thing, instead of the free bottle we were supposed to get, we got a coupon for some slot credit. Well the coupon had their old rewards club name, and I went to the players club and they were transitioning into the Total Rewards Club. The coupon said I would get $15 slot credit, but with the new Total Rewards I would have to play more and then I'd be given $40. After going back and forth from the Players Club and Cashier at least 5 times, they ended up denying me the $40 when they CLEARLY told me that if I played enough I would get it. I certainly played enough, complained to them, and got no comps or anything for all my troubles due to THEIR mistakes. That really ruined the end of my trip. -1 BIG star

After 9pm the place livens up a bit with beautiful dealers wearing lingerie and girls dancing on poles (classy!) but thats not enough to make me want to go back.

I was hesitant, but the rates were much cheaper, so I thought ""why not?!?""

Now I'll tell you why that was a mistake:

We arrived a few hours before check-in, but we assumed we could check in early because we always do at the Cosmo. Right here I quickly learned that PH is nothing like the Cosmo. The man checking us in informed us that it would be an $18.60 charge and kept trying to convince us to stay in a room with a better view for $20 more a night. We decided to stay in the room we booked, which turned out to be a total dump! 

The room itself was on a ""non-smoking floor."" I put that in quotes because the entire floor smelled like smoke for the 3 nights that we were there. Clearly no one enforced this ""rule."" By the time I left, I had a sore throat and a headache from all of the smoke.

When we got into the room I thought ""this looks familiar!"" The reason it looked familiar was because I had stayed in the same room 12 years ago when it was the Aladdin. Not much had changed in 12 years. The decor was not very ""Hollywood"" at all. (I know Hollywood, I lived there for over 10 years...) The faucets even still have the genie lamps on them! The ""Miracle Mile"" mall looks like the Middle East (again, the Aladdin decor has not changed there either.)

Our friends had a huge suite with an amazing view, but unfortunately the view was the only high point. The room felt old as well; definitely not worth the price of a suite.

This hotel needs a major upgrade and remodel. Hopefully Britney's upcoming shows will bring in enough cash to allow them to do so. The one thing I learned from our trip: just spend the extra money and stay at the Cosmo. It's clean and modern and the staff treats you like royalty.

And don't even get me started on the $20 per night resort fee! It's ridiculous that we had to pay that since we weren't using the gym or the internet. The final price with the extra fees would have allowed us to stay somewhere much more upscale. Wish I had known that. Total disappointment!

One final note: we had to cut and design our own ""Do not disturb"" sign because they didn't give us one. Is paper that expensive these days? I should not have to do graphic design work while on vacation, especially when I'm not getting paid for it!!!",6,1,2

The pool was free didn't ask for room key or anything, just walked straight in. Has two pools, one which is for all ages and another for just 21 and older.

While I did have an overall enjoyable stay here, there are definitely aspects of the hotel that can be improved upon. 

I had reserved a non-smoking ""Hip"" room with a king bed, but upon check-in, realized they had put me in a smoking room that smelled heavily of marijuana. I went back down to the front desk immediately and let them know that I had booked a non-smoking room, but they informed me that they had no non-smoking rooms available at the time. The woman at the front desk offered for housekeeping to come up and spray my room with air freshener, but I declined the offer.

She then let me know that they could accommodate my reservation by performing a room change the next day. She said they would upgrade me to a larger, non-smoking room on a higher level, and that I would receive a phone call as soon as my new room was ready.

By 3pm the next day, I still hadn't heard from the front desk, so I called down to see if my upgraded room was ready. The woman at the front desk said it was, so I'm not sure why they hadn't called me. I will say that I was satisfied with my upgraded room. It was larger, very clean, and had a nice view of the strip.

That same day, my husband and I visited the swimming pool. Unfortunately, we were a bit turned off by the pool area. There were empty beer cans, bottles, and cups laying everywhere, debris in the pool and hot tub, and even the cabanas that you could rent appeared to be dirty and had stained cushions. We ended up leaving the pool area after about 20-30 mins.

As I mentioned earlier, I LOVE the location of Planet Hollywood and some of its amenities, but it wouldn't be my first choice to stay at when visiting Vegas again.",0,0,0

While I started out at a suite at TI, swapped to PH the last 2 days and loved it. Best decision ever... even though it was a little hard to find (not right near the strip) with some PH globe nowhere near the actual hotel...

LOCATION
This was the first time I have stayed in the new City Center and LOVED it. Location is fabulous, love the convenience of stepping outside and being near several dining and shopping options. There is energy and a vibe that is so much more interesting than the old (Venetian \/ Caesars\/ TI etc) area... where you walk for miles just looking at water or sidewalk... 

PERKS
The mall is fun, there is free WiFi all over - Starbucks, McDs, etc. Made it uber convenient for getting information on the tablet and phones... prices at all the stores are more reasonable too, because there is so much competition... 

Really good eateries and a booklet with promos and coupons that we didnt get to use... seemed like a lot of weight could have been gained, if there had been more time.

Oh, did I mention there is a Ross store close by?  Had to checkout the place for backup outfits! ;-)

CASINO
One night coming back from the Cosmo (across the street - nice lounge\/club), was intrigued by a cover band playing in the 'Lounge Ax' area... stayed to watch the show,  they band played to the audience nicely, trying to engage... and the sporty (referee outfit - incongruous) dressed waitress was very nice, and got us very excellent mojitos. 

I think there was a lot more to explore... really liked the clubby rock n roll vibe of the place. Such a welcome change then the stodgy and touristy places I have been going to the previous years.

HALLS & ROOM
Not a fan of the dark and punky colors in the halls.  

Room was clean and okay... like dark purple, but I think the memorabilia was not anything great, and the furniture seemed to be arranged a little awkwardly, like there was an end table missing or something. Bathroom was good though.

SUMMARY
Next time, definitely would stay here again... although Cosmopolitan looks really interesting too. Love the SATC decor over there... and I heard the pool lounge area is entertaining... almost like the commercials.",0,0,0

She provided us with all the information that we needed for the hotel. Mary Jayne you rock!

The rooms were ok, nothing special but they were a place to sleep which is really all we wanted for our 2 night stay. My Husband booked 2 rooms via his Perks subscription for us and his Family to stay in. The rooms were on the small side and really dark inside, they really had seen better days too. Paint was chipped and housekeeping wasn't overly enthusiastic in regards to the dusting but the location was perfect. We were on the 21st floor which has some nice views and was quiet, what I really didn't like was there was only one working Ice Machine for the entire floor, I had to walk right around to the other side of the building in my PJ's twice to fill up a tiny little bucket.

Britney happened to be performing on the 2nd night that we stayed and thought it nice that they place her pictures up around the elevator area, not so cool when fans are holding up the line to get one while posing and taking pictures there. Maybe have a designated area for this sort of thing?

I visit Las Vegas frequently for business and I am always looking for a great Hotel. One of my pet peeves is a room that doesn't allow fresh air inside, as I can never get the central air to a temperature I desire. 
I have been working on a project at the new City Center, across from Planet Hollywood, so the location seemed perfect. 

I decided to give up my fabulous 1 bedroom suite at the Marriott Grand Chateau because of the crappy pool facility and took advantage of a special at PH. I walked across Harmon Avenue with my bags and meandered my way through the maze to the checkin desk. I stood in line for an hour and a half to get checked in while the staff handed out water and chocolates on a silver tray. The hip lobby and casino are beautifully designed but the halls are seriously in need of a good clean and\/or makeover. 

Once inside my room I decided to have a nap and get ready for the night. I awoke with burning eyes, dry throat and a stuffy nose. The bedside table and wall was covered in a mysterious white dusk and I realized it was coming from the vent above. i decided to investigate and stood on a chair to look inside the vent. To my horror the entire cavity was caked with toxic gook that looked like lint from a dryer covered in glue. i removed the vent cover with a nail file and uncovered what was certainly old construction debris, drywall dust, insulation and other unknown toxic crap blowing not only through my vent, but certainly through the entire hotel. 

I called to be transferred to another room and waited 2 hours for engineering to survey the problem. When he finally  arrived I showed him the mess and he explained that it was an old hotel and the problem was normal. There was nothing he could do but send a maid to clean up the mess. I waited another hour and nobody ever showed up. I called the front desk again, explained my frustration, and lugged all my shit downstairs to stand in line again for another 45 minutes. I was finally moved me to a new room -apparently an upgrade- but the vents were in the same condition. Seeing as there was no refund on pre-paid reservations I was pretty much doomed. i headed to the nearest 7-11, bought a roll of duct tape and covered the vents up with towels for the night. 

I sent an email to the hotel many weeks later, after they sent me a survey to rate my stay. I promptly sent photos of the vents and explained that I thought it appalling that they would subject guests to such horrendous conditions. I am sure that the entire hotel is blowing the same debris into the sleeping lungs of gamblers nightly. I received an apology from the general manager a month later stating that the room had been cleaned and that they would send a report over to engineering to investigate further. 

I would never stay at this hotel again. Any big hotel of this caliber on the strip that does not properly maintain the most important element of a Hotel room -air conditioning and ventilation- does not rate at all in my book. The dangers of such reckless maintenance procedures should be apparent  and I encourage everyone not to be fooled by smoke and mirrors.",6,0,0

I got hooked up w\/ a resort room which had some Clint Eastwood memorabilia in it.  The rooms are updated and moderately priced...though they're nothing like the suites at Aria or Palazzo\/Venetian but you'll get better value from PH.  Cab fare to and from the airport is about $20.

Make sure to get your room in the North Tower which is newer and easier to get to.  Fountain view is nice as hell when u just wanna chill in the room for a bit.

Miracle Mile shops are convenient with stores that you would actually buy stuff from as opposed to overpriced boutiques.
The casino area is sexy and lively w\/ the Passion Pit girls and music going on well into the night with a lounge area in the center if you just wanna drink and kick it.  It'll keep you distracted enough to hit on 15.

It's too bad Privé got shut down as that was a nice club.  But I hear there are some other things in the works here that should offer up some better nightlife.

I'm a fan of this casual and hip hotel and this will be my first choice when using my comps w\/ Harrahs.

Pai Gow: There are about 3 tables that I saw.  One is on the far end facing the bar.  Sucks that none of them are in the passion pit.  Though I've never seen pai gow in any of the high traffic areas usually.  Then again I've never seen a hot pai gow dealer...lol.",2,1,1

I believe they purposely required you after parking to walk through the entire miracle mile of shops just to check in so you would shop. The benefits of staying here are that it's cheaper than many of the mid strip hotels, close to Marquee for day or night club (walk across the bridge), day pool is nothing fancy but has a party section and a 2nd pool for a quieter relaxing atmosphere, and of course the shopping. You can find a ton of stores and of course a Fat Tuesdays. Many people already have in their itinerary to get a drink and stroll through the miracle mile or Forum shops, so by staying at PH, you already have consolidated one part of your trip.  Overall, it's a great place for a central location that won't break the budget as compared to other hotels. There's also the spice market buffet downstairs which we appreciated, but it wasn't remarkably unique besides the bottomless wine, beer, or champagne. There are a lot of groupons that came up in the past month for the Koi lounge and the buffet here at PH so you could look into those offers. The rooms are rather simple and have movie memorabilia in frames. We asked for an upgrade with 20 dollars and were put up on the north tower on the top floor, with a view of the strip. The bathroom was larger with two vanities and did the trick for our group. Overall, nothing fancy, but we mainly paid for the central location and we all had a good time! :)",0,0,0

Lets just say this... nasty... There is a reason why the rooms are kind of dark and that's to make it so the jizz stains on the walls do not show. I am not joking... you could clearly see where the load was blasted across the wall next to the bed. 

I brought this to the attention of the front desk and they simply did not care. They moved me to a diff rent room but this room was worse then the last one. The finish on the tv stand was very worn and the room just felt grungy, I then notice another Jizz shot across the wall and a hand print! Freaking nasty! 

I get it, I am in Vegas and people like to be freaks when out here but whoa.

So I go down for a second time and again get no care at all from the desk but they move me again. This time I see no loads on the walls or anything but still am a bit disgusted by the whole thing. 

I was in Vegas with friends and they were staying in other rooms. They had someone enter their rooms when they were asleep and steal stuff from them! (This is more then one room btw.)

The casino: 4 stars.  The dealers for the most part were pleasant, and they do not use that many (shuffle) machines.  They had plenty of single deck black jack tables and they always played good music.  They've got a bar (Heart Bar) in the middle of the casino.  If you're tired of gambling you can take a break there..they play good music (they have a DJ, go-go dancers until 2AM).  The casino would've gotten 4.5 stars, except the cocktail waitress don't come around too often. 

The rooms: 2.5 stars.  The rooms were well done, with flat screen TVs.  It was decorated nicely and the beds were comfortable.  They did have a safe inside the room, which was nice.  They did not have a mini bar in the room, but did have bottled water there for $3 each.  Watch out for static, since the bedsheets wer generated a lot of static.  They were doing construction in adjacent rooms, and we were a bit annoyed by the noise at times.  For some reason the bathroom sink backed up at times and sewers came up once.. grossed out my wife.  The housekeeper was a bit agressive too.. I guess she wanted to do all the rooms before she went on her lunch break.  These things subtracted from the otherwise nice and clean room.

Overall the hotel was nice and I'd definitely stay there again.  Their price was pretty decent as well (we stayed there mon-thurs).  Overall 3 solid stars, and if we there weren't a couple of annoyances in our rooms, the place would've gotten 4 stars.

The first time, we stayed at NY NY and *loved* it, but wanted to stay other places each time we go.  We picked PH because of it's central location on the strip, and because it was SO fun when we went in on our last trip to see Peepshow.  

I wasn't unhappy enough to with this to give it a bad rating, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it or stay here again.  

Check-in was fine, we checked in, got rooms next to the couple we were with and headed up. Their room wasn't ready, but no big deal, we stashed stuff in one room and it was just fine!

1) The pool S.U.C.K.S. Period.  There are two separate pool areas, one 21+ and a ""regular"" pool, both separated by a very large concrete area with lounge chairs for the general population (can't see the pools from this area at all).  Apparently you are to rent the daybeds\/cabanas\/chairs that are directly poolside.  However, this was Oct. and it was barely 70 degrees so it wasn't busy, so we nabbed a daybed and no one asked questions.  That being said, since it was ""cooler"" for LV and not busy, I only got to spend one afternoon up by the pool, if it had actually been average Las Vegas temps when we were there and it was busy, I would have been REALLY disappointed in the pool. 

2) The movies featured in the rooms are really stupid and obscure (Big Bully??). Silly and incidental and wouldn't cause me to NOT stay there again, but worth mentioning. 

3) The outlets were few and far between in the room; annoying.

4) bathroom is a waste of space; it's HUGE compared to the room

5) The bed isn't secured to the wall, or the frame or anything it may normally be secured to.... so it can flip up from the end: DON'T jump on the beds.

6) The Casino: I'm not sure we ever found our way straight out to the strip or to the mall or back to our room without getting lost. 

I DID really like the fact that the ABC store was right there and had anything you could need (soda, snacks, beer, alcohol, toiletries, etc. etc. etc.) That was a really nice perk.  Also the 24 hour Starbucks was nice.

The downside is that I stayed when the hotel was just changing over to PH from the Aladdin and half of the hotel was still the Aladdin (thankfully not the half that I was in) but from what I hear that you can tell that it needed work. 

The rooms are very comfortable, but the armoires don't have any drawers in some of the rooms and if they have drawers then they have 1. The TV s are all flat screens and the beds are comfy. The views are actually not bad, but since there's construction across the street you'll get a better view closer to the pool area or on the southside of the building. 

If you're staying at another hotel, stop by Planet Hollywood and try out the penny slots (Top Gun is the BEST!)

You'll find the usual nationally-known retailers at the mall mixed in with more of the West\/Pacific Coast ones and bars\/restos. High end meets lower end. And well, with the location, you're about at the half way point from one of the Strip to the other.

In general, it's one of the newer hotels on the strip comparatively with modern rooms with comfy beds. Each room is decorated with some hollywood-replica-iconic jacket or portrait but not completely dolled out with stuff everywhere. So not tacky.

Casino itself is alright but nothing too terribly exciting. There are a lot of restaurants that are more on the higher end, clubs (think pink bunny), and one of its many bars typically has a LIVE band playing. 

Pool is lukewarm. There are 2 separate pools with only a few chairs around the pools themselves. Sort of abysmal of a set up considering hangin out at the pools ranks up there in terms of hype in Vegas. During the summer, the sun is blocked by the casinos\/condos across the street. So for a good couple hours way before the sun sets, the pools are completely shaded. Sadly there is no way getting around unless they moved the pools to a different location altogether.

All in all, like the proximity to everything and room cleanliness factor. When in Vegas, you don't stay in one casino anyways so I recommend staying here for sure.",1,0,0

The HOTEL ROOM
I was not looking forward to my virgin trip to Las Vegas after reading the horrible reviews PH received on yelp. This was my husband's trip. He wanted to meet up with his cousin from Germany who was staying there, so it really was by default. I wanted to know what we were getting into. All the horror reviews of dildos found under beds, rooms that seemed to be only halfway cleaned up after ""what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"" nights scared the $#!+ out of me. What would WE find under our bed? I envisioned pubic hair dust bunnies in the corners of the bathroom, tiny liquor bottles hidden in the drawers, and cracks in the TV screen from 20 inch heals thrown across the room in a fit of bachelorette drunken stuper.
We accidentally made the rookie mistake of parking at Ceasar's Palace thinking Planet Hollywood was a part of that hotel. CP is so enormous, it HAD to have 2 hotels in one right? Wrong? Hey, it even had a Planet Hollywood globe outside. When we went to the desk, they didn't have our reservations. We were told our hotel was down the strip just ""a block or so"". So we took the trek to the real PH. The place was really hip and fresh and modern. It took some time to find the lobby to check in. Top tip for those going to Vegas for the first time: NO ONE is good at giving directions. So just walk around until you find it yourself. It's less frustrating. I digress...
The check in was quick. The look of frustration on our faces may have helped in getting us a good room. While the check in clerk was not the friendliest chap on the strip that day, he did hook us up with a fairly decent room. We got a room on the top floor of our wing that gave us a good view of the Bellagio fountains and overlooked our pool. 
Each room at PH features a particular film complete with photo stills and props. We got the movie Natural Born Killers which was OK, but my husband's cousin's room had Empire Records which I am, to this day, a huge (like know-every-word) fan of that film. We considered switching rooms for like...a second or two, until we realized we were in Las Vegas and wouldn't be in our rooms very much and well, that would just be crazy. **right?**
So no pubes in the room at all. No dildo either. What WAS there was a huge modern soaking tub and separate shower, big TV in tact (which was never even switched on), a makeup mirror, modern furniture, and a great view: also a nice thick shade to block out the daylight effect that happens only in Vegas at 3am!). It also had a nice safe to hide our mac book & my purse.
The CASINO
I was overwhelmed. My husband and I had never gambled before, so all of this was a bit like a fish out of water experience. The dealers were awesome. My father-in-law; a very seasoned Vegas man and gambler, laughed at us when we asked him if the dealers helped people out. To our shock and amusement, they actually did. At every table, the dealer seemed to smell our virgin blood (or the look of anxiety on our faces) and were so happy to give us a quick lesson before our first bets. The black-jack dealer, Cyndi was a smart ass bitch and I loved her. She gave us tips before and after each hand, letting us know what we did right and what we could have done better. She made us laugh and she was well tipped for it. It was my favorite part of the trip. The same was true for Roulette tables.
The FOOD & SHOPPING
We ate at the food court on our first day. We don't have Las Vegas restaurant money, so budget eating was our plan. Although at Smash Burger 3 burgers, 2 fries, 2 beers, and a water was around $60! I had read Earl of Sandwich was amazing, but the line was so long and we were starving and couldn't wait. I really wanted to eat at Gordon Ramsey's pub, but it was really pricey. We figured if we struck it rich, we would go there for dinner or lunch the next day. There were a ton of places to eat though and I really think it would be amazing if money wasn't an issue. For breakfast, we went to Blondie's Sports Bar & Grill. They have a bacon, eggs, and hash brown breakfast for $2.99! That was the cheapest food we had seen so far and it was great. Our waiter was super attentive & was also from Texas! It looks like a great place to hang out for games. They have tables with self serving taps on them that I think is GENIUS! If I had a bar, I would do the same thing. GENIUS I tell you!!!
The shopping was a great experience even though we didn't buy anything. The mall attached to the hotel and casino is gorgeous. It has a section similar to the Venetian hotel, with the ceiling painted like the sky with faux buildings. It was nice to just walk around and enjoy the window shopping.
All in all, I had a great experience at Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino. It may not be the fanciest place on the strip, but it was clean and it was friendly. What else could I ask for to pop my Vegas cherry?",4,2,2

- Party is always on 24\/7 @this casino! Whether it was at 12pm, 10pm, or 4am, music was always pumping, young & beautiful people were plentiful, everyone was just having a good time.
- Location is awesome!! Can't beat Center Strip! And not outrageously expensive to boot.
- Rooms were clean & hip. Not completely spotless, but decent.
- Beds were very comfy & I slept like a baby!
- Part of the package my friends & I booked got us a free bottle of booze. Came in handy when we were pre-gaming before a night out! hehe
- Bonus was that they are now part of the Harrah's chain of hotels, so I was able to rack up some Rewards points while staying here! Woohoo!

Cons:
- Front desk is severely understaffed & painfully slow. And not all the Front desk people were nice\/friendly, it was hit or miss.
- It took forever for us to get anything from Front desk or Housekeeping. When I tried calling the Front desk, I was on hold for an average of 5-10 mins each time I called. And when I called back to check on a request for toilet paper that the Front desk girl said was on it's way up 30 mins prior, she snapped at me when I called back to check on the delayed TP.
- I know this can happen to every hotel, but all the drains were slow in our room (sink & shower). 1 of my personal pet peeves, skeeves me to finish a shower in my own muck lol - bleh!
- Wasn't crazy about no locks on the bathroom doors. They're double doors that just swing shut, but anyone can walk in on you unless you announce to your roomies that you are using the shower.

Overall, I did like the hotel, but not sure if I'd stay here again. If the Wynn were completely overbooked, I'd rather stay @the MGM Mirage or Treasure Island which I think were much better than PH.",0,0,0

The beds were comfy... although if you jumped on the foot of the bed to sit, the bed popped up! Lol. Other than that, it was fine.

I have stayed here once (a few years back)--my room was clean and fine and there were no zero issues.

I discovered it's typically less expensive for Las Vegas casino hotels, and it's right on the Strip, so that's what attracted me. I had enjoyed the sushi restaurant on an earlier visit, so my mind was made up to stay at Planet Hollywood. I am not sorry I did.  I liked the hipper ""vibe"" and the fact the hotel sits atop a mall so there was something to do other than gamble. You can either just window shop, fantasize what you'd do if you won the $1 million shopping spree, or like I did, shop and dine here; the ABC Store had reasonably priced sundry items and snacks and was convenient for grabbing a bottle of water or some antacid before heading up to the room. There was a great sale going on at the Metropolitan Museum of Art shop too. Unlike the Bellagio, you walk off the elevator, through the casino and you are out on the strip in no time.   Ironically, the sushi restaurant was always closed while I was there. Check-in went smoothly but it was so noisy I just smiled and nodded at whatever the desk clerk said.  But that's a minor complaint since I loved the 80s soundtrack to my stay.  The room was enormous, strangely so, triangular in shape, and the decor was dark and sort of odd, reminding me of the Munsters, shades of purple, green and black. Not exactly my taste..  The large bathroom had two vanities which I liked but the water pressure in the shower was extremely low.  The decor of the hotel and casino is unspectacular and I kind of missed the ""Hollywood"" theme except there's some sort of VIP thing going on which I couldn't figure out.  I never could find my way through the casino to the right elevator, which at first was humorous but then became annoying. And guests take the elevator for just one flight since it's hard making out where the escalators are located.  The staff was not particularly friendly, but then most of the time I had trouble hearing them, and the woman at the guest center was downright rude as she was ready for her break and didn't feel like helping anyone else.  At least be apologetic!  The concierge was very helpful and recommended the Hawaiian Tropic restaurant in the mall which was great, as well as a sushi restaurant at Caesar's.  The pool was wonderful with lots of lounge chairs to relax in.  PH wouldn't necessarily be my first choice for a stay in Las Vegas, (look for a Palazzo review coming soon) but I'd stay here again.",1,2,0

We stayed here for my Bachelorette party, there were 20 of us. Checking in took us 30 minutes. No joke. It was really difficult for us to get 5 rooms on the same floor and have 2 sets of 2 rooms that adjoined. Even though we had requested this from the beginning (booked 4 months in advance) and we checked in on a Thursday (shouldn't have been too busy). When we left the front desk the line was insane! There were only 4 people checking people in and the line had to have been 30 people deep. I felt terrible! We also had to have a rollaway bed in one room. That was $30 a night-insane!

The customer service in the casino and the hotel was pretty much non-existent. We asked many times for them to open Blackjack tables for us so we could gamble. Usually our request is granted since we are a bunch of good looking girls who will probably be giving the hotel all of our money-not serious gamblers! But nope, one pit boss directed us to the other pit boss who told us that we had been mistaken and it wasn't possible. They sent us to Paris and Bally's. Do you normally send that many people to gamble elsewhere? Are you dumb?

There's no clubs in Planet Hollywood and ""Rock Bar"" is the most ghetto place I have ever been in my life. Sweet Jesus, I am from Chicago, and that place gives some dive bars I've been to a run for their money. Avoid at all costs!!!!

Earl's is good, but the line is always sooooo long. Sugar Factory was pretty good, overpriced of course, just like everything else in Vegas ;) We also ate at Yolo's one night. It was good, not great, the service was sub par-they messed up so many orders.

There's plenty of space in the bathroom. Both the shower and toilet have well designed doors so other people can be in the bathroom even if someone is showering or on the toilet. The only bad thing about the bathroom is the mirror. This was an issue for me as a girl because the mirror was pretty far away, so it was hard to see when doing make up. 

Moving to the room, there was a little sofa\/lounge chair, the king-sized bed, and the hot tub. Though the hot tub cannot seat that many, it was a fun little area for everyone to sit around and just relax. One negative about the room was the hot tub jets. We had trouble getting them to start because you had to fill the tub with enough water and the sensor was not working well.

The living room\/kitchen which was the rest of the suite. A big thumbs up for the projector in the living room area. That was definitely a perk and when you're sleeping in the morning with the screen down, it literally feels like night time. The screen does a good job keeping the light out. The pull-out and sofa were all pretty comfortable. Though it is dangerous to get too comfortable watching the projector. You'll forget you're in Vegas and not want to move from the sofa. The full kitchen provided a good area to eat\/drink\/cook whatever you wish. 

The location of the rooms is kind of out of the way because you have to walk half of the Miracle Mile Shops to get there, but once you come down the elevators, the pool is just to the left. No matter where you go in the hotel, there's a walk involved.
Good places to go at PH:
- Earl of Sandwich
- Pink's Hot Dog
- Fat Tuesday
- Lobster ME

The first night I arrived to find that the room I booked and the room I was getting were not the same I received a resort room with one king size bed for 3 people. There was no rooms available with 2 beds and I was given no other option but to wait until the next day. They could not even provide me with a cot! 

The next day I called in the morning to see when my next room would be available I was told it would be by 1230. Come 1230 it is still not available and I am told that they don't know when it would be available because a diamond member was staying in it. 2pm checked again nothing 3pm nothing 4pm they finally had it available but would not release the room keys to the persons I had listed that were also staying in the room. They told that person that I had not added them as occupants which he had clearly seen me do the first night. Finally we get in our room with 2 queen size beds (in what they called their resort room). 

In the new room the bathroom smelled like sewage constantly. 

In both rooms there was no refrigerator.  

Housekeeping did not make the  bed because there was a suitcase next to it. 

There was no free wifi. (That's a big deal nowadays guys and a pretty standard practice) 

All in all no one was helpful. No one could provide me with better options for my inconvenience. And the staff lacked friendliness, eye contact, and problem solving skills.

I was so excited to celebrate my birthday here but ended up leaving early and left feeling frustrated. Frustrated since I walked into the room. I have never seen such an outdated, dusty and dirty room with lights that didn't even work. But I sucked it up because I didn't want to put a damper to the birthday festivities. Engineering came about an hour later to fix the lighting and all is good. My girl friends and I went down to the spa on the 27th; the male spa attendant was not welcoming and was very short with us as if we were intruding on his day and didn't have time for us, just checked us in but didn't give us directions and where to go and was shuffled off into a different direction. It was our first time here, we had no clue on where to go! Next we were greeted by another young lady. Again she was not friendly, she told us to sign and initial a sheet of paper, didn't give us an explanation to what we were signing and once we questioned what it was she got upset and with a louder and firmer tone of voice she said it doesn't matter and to just sign and initial! She was speaking very fast as of she was rushing us to get our of her way and got upset again when we asked her how to use the lockers. I expected a tour of the spa but no, she pointed with her finger where to go and just left! We had to figure out the whole place by ourselves. After the spa, we went back to the room only to see that our food that we purchased earlier that day have been removed from the refrigerator. I called the front desk and told the young lady what happened and she transferred housekeeping, not sure why but as soon as the male answered he said he couldn't help me and to call security. For what?! I just want my food, I am diabetic and needed to eat something before my sugar gets to low and I didn't have time to be giving the run around. So I called front desk again and the same young lady picked up and said he should've helped me, I felt as if they were just passing the buck and no one wanted to help me just like the employees at the spa! She put me on hold and then told me she would have a manager call me back. I received a call later from Brian, titled asthe Assistant Hotel Manager, told him the incident of the food and said security needs to come up and do a lock interrogationin the room to see who entered it. Ok I get it for my own security, cool send them up. Then I received a phone call from housekeeping from the man that said he couldn't help me and said that according to his records no one has entered the room and its not their fault the food is missing. I wasnt pointing fingers! I just wanted a solution to my problem. I couldn't wait any longer to for Brian to call us back because I need to get something to eat, so we left and came back to a voice message on the room phone. He said that the lock interrogation report says that no one entered the room and there's nothing they can do about it and if I needed proof I can come downstairs to look, other than that I'm out of luck. At this point I feel very frustrated and every here made me feel like a liar and I'm over here crying to my girl friends because this stay has been ruining my birthday! I came downstairs to speak with the front desk because over the phone was getting too complicated. The young lady went and got her manager Roberto and he came up and right away handed me the lock intinterrogation report, didn't introduce himself just handed it to us. Wow, that's not even what I came down for. As if he just assumed that's what it was just that and again felt as if I was brushed off and didn't even matter as if I was wasting his time! I tried to tell him what was going on the but kept cutting me off and not letting me speak! I wanted to tell him about the spa experience and then he cut me off saying that they don't own the spa and it' not the hotels fault whatever they did. But it doesn't matter! Front desk is the face of the company! No one here wanted to take accountability. No one cared to provide a solution. I felt treated very unfairly, like I wasn't important and as I if I was a liar! And the worst part was wasting my time! This never happens to me when I stay at any MGM properties, Wynn or Mandarin! I told Roberto just to check me out I'm ready to leave and he said, ""Fine. But we will still charge you since it's past midnight"" which it was only 11pm. wow, I can't believe the disrespect this man was giving me. He doesn't care to lose revenue; he doesn't care that Caesars is bankrupt and in debt or about his guests!
We left the desk feeling even worse. I felt as if he strip me and humiliatated me in front of everyone. I don't understand why this had to escalate to social media to help but it has. I can't even understand why it even escalated in the first place, it should have been taken care of from the moment I made a phone call.

The room had a Kingpin - Woody Harrelson - theme. Let's just say that theme continued throughout the stay as the room had been highly abused by, I'm assuming, the constant more rowdy crowds. It was clean enough, but the carpet was dirty & absolutely all furniture was very dinged up. The view was nice from the 26th floor as we looked out over the Bellagio fountains. The smell of smoke came into our room which was the most annoying thing to me personally. Our beds backed up to the elevator shaft which was loud, and there was no break as there is constant traffic at all hours through the night. When we left to catch a plane at 5am, the lobby looked as it did at midnight--so a great place for those who go hard. We saw the JLo show here in the hotel. The venue has flat seating, meaning that if the person in front of you is a touch too tall, you lose all visibility. There are also poles throughout that interfere with some seating views. The pool on the 6th floor is also made for partying as there are only about 15 chairs. People were lined up at 10am to snag these. Otherwise you are left to pay $300 for a cabana or sit on the cement, as they are hoping everyone is in the pool vs lounging. Drinks are a touch expensive for the type of hotel, with one small frozen drink being around $20. There are extensive shops attached to the hotel; such the kind you'd find in a regular mall setting. Outside the hotel is the constant smell of weed, with a rough crowd where one might anticipate being pick-pocketed or hearing gunshots. There are men with stripper billboards on their backs & more people offering strip club or hooker\/escort cards than we've found anywhere else.

First time, I ended up in the hospital (had nothing to do with PH) and the second time, I spent a good hour or two wrapped up in one of our bed's comforters, crying to my friends in the hallway outside of our room (probably the most dramatic Vegas trip thus far). Even though both times, there was absolutely nothing wrong with PH, the mention of PH still brings back bad memories.

With that said, I feel like it's unfair to rate them poorly, so based on the hotel itself, I have no complaints! I mean, come on, Star Trek memorabilia?! I was so excited when my friend pointed it out when we were settling in. Both times, we stayed in a Hollywood Hip Room and the beds were pretty comfy.

Plus, Earl of Sandwich is located inside PH and anytime you're hungry (seriously, it's open 24\/7), you can go down and grab a sub! Since our friends are Diamond members, we also don't have to wait in the horrendous line to order.

We reserved two other rooms for our daughter and friends. Rate was reasonable and rooms are nicely updated. Service is very inconsistent. 
There was a flood during our stay so half the casino floor and one wing of elevators were closed. We felt trapped anytime we needed to take the elevators to our room or leave the casino because there were mobs of people trying to get on and off since the other wing was closed. What a nightmare! One time, we walked down 10 flights of stairs to exit. Another time, we had to walk through the entire mall on our way to the club while our Uber waited 20min. Hotel mgmnt should be prepared for incidents like this and have a plan in place to help with the flow of people. I spoke with several people that waited 30min- an hour for the elevator! We literally avoided returning to our hotel once we left so we didn't have to avoid the crazy elevator line and mobs of people grouped in one area. 
We were greeted by friendly valet but dealt with an extremely RUDE BELL MAN that took our bags; young 20ish yr old that was outright angry to be there. Service at the Burger Bar was excellent. We enjoyed conversing with the sous chef, Daniel, and the food was delicious! The truffle fries are a must try. 
Dealt with an awful waitress with a bad attitude at the sports book cafe. There was a soccer game on that the bartenders and waitress were watching. She was visibly annoyed that we asked to be seated and she had to tear herself away from the game. I was embarrassed for my daughter and her friends  when she rolled her eyes while they were deciding on their order. 
The miracle miles shop is very convenient. There's nothing better than drinking while you shop!
The pool was the highlight of our stay. We booked a cabana and ordered a bottle. The cost for the cabana was very reasonable relative to other hotels and our waitress, Felicia I think, was awesome.
The DJ was great and the bikini contest was hilarious. 
Cashiers were friendly. Tables were hit and miss. I had some luck on blackjack but slots are very tight. 
Wifi was a nightmare. It seemed like it worked everywhere but this hotel. Couldn't ever get service in our rooms.

On the strip went to 8 different casinos on this trip waited 3-4 minutes at all the others. Go to check in they confirm reservation and was told got your room preselected and was sent on our way. We get to the room that was suppose to have the fountain view with a king bed and had two doubles. I will not sleep on a double ""6'5 300"" I hang off plus it is a vacation for the wife and I, be nice to be in same bed without a kid. Go back down and told it's just a preference but called 2 days before to check in and was told we got you for a king, but we can up grade for $20
More a night  so not much choice and that's all we can do, but another couple we traveled with came 2 hours later and got the exact room that we should have had on a upgrade to there room. So it's all about getting more on the rooms so don't do the upgrade. I asked for a manager on 3 different occasions to ask about it and there was not one to talk to.

The man who helped us gave me an upgrade to a bigger room with a view of Bellagio! I enjoyed the water show every night while getting ready! My bf smokes cigarettes so we check into a smoking room. When I first walked in I thought it was going to reek of the smell of smoke, but it didn't (thank goodness). The room was a good size and I love the double vanities so that I can get ready without sharing counter space. 

The casino was right downstairs and around 9PM they have go-go dancers dancing on the tables in the ""pleasure pit"" area.

The rooms are old and need updating. It smells like old building. The curtains resemble corrugated cardboard, and it's so loud when you lift and lower the curtain that you can hear when your neighbor does it. 

The decor is creepy. My room had Titanic props and there is a creepy baby doll hanging from the wall. The wifi is also reeeeaaaally slow. It was included in the resort fee, but I would NOT pay for it if it ever came to that. 

The pool on the 6th floor is the worst pool I have ever been to in Vegas. We couldn't bring a bag in to carry our belongings. You have to use a locker which is located inside the hotel. There are minimal chairs by the pool, no tables other than for gambling, and we were forced to sit in the common area where there is only a bunch of chairs, some music, no shade, and 100 degrees. The 21+ pool has an outdoor PA cranked with subwoofers and you can't even have a conversation.  

On the bright side, we were able to create our own seats by grabbing some chairs that were put away and strategically placed them in the pool area, tucked away in a small area not really meant for chairs.  Also, the room seemed clean. We didn't get eaten alive in our bed like we did on our last vacation to Puerto Rico.  The only bug we saw all trip in Vegas was a cockroach in the old strip near Golden Nugget. Outside. Not inside. 

The last positive note is that their waitresses in the casino were really good about bringing drinks to the slots. I usually only get 1 round and give up. 

Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.  With all the comps going on and newer hotels, why would you even bother staying at Planet Hollywood? It's not terrible here, but it just doesn't compare to the newer hotels on the strip.  We got a deal when we bought airfare, but it wasn't worth it.",2,0,1

The host asked us if we wanted to upgrade to a 1200sf suite with an extra attached room (500sf) for $850.  For an extra $25\/head, it was well worth the price! With all that space, we never felt cramped - as opposed to previous experiences where the rooms were so small that all we can do in them was to sleep.  Although the room (and hotel itself) isn't as luxurious as the Bellagio, Mirage, Wynn or many others, it was very spacious, had an amazing view, and was perfect to party in.

Personally, I think there are three types of hotels in Vegas.

1) The ultra-lush, very $$$, and super sterile luxurious ones.
2) The pretty cool and fun ones.
3) The ghetto motel quality ones.

My room did not have a room service menu. Called housekeeping to send one up. Waited 30 min and had to call again. Waited way too long so I got dressed and went to earls sandwich to get food. By the time I got back to my room, I hopped in the shower, got out and FINALLY got a knock on the door with the room service menu. 

As I was getting ready, I plugged my straightener in and all the lights in the bathroom went out. Called front desk and was an easy fix but also wanted to know why the lights on the dresser mirror didn't work either. 

Ofcourse in Vegas you have very very late nights.... So I put the ""do not disturb"" sign into the card reader around 530am. Sure enough around 11 am housekeeping is knocking on the door and actually opens the door. Good thing I had the lock on. I don't know if another person staying had stole the sign out of my door or what but it was definitely a rude awakening. The next day house keeping came at the same time and this time I was awake to tell her I did not need service. I fell back to sleep and from 1pm-4pm someone tried opening my door twice !!!!!!!! I told housekeeping I did not need service why is my door being opened not just once but twice ! Thank goodness for the lock on the door they can't open it all the way.

It was recently remodeled and not a bad room but certainly nothing special and kind of small. I had the mountain facing room, which is fine because if you face the Bellagio be prepared to hear the fountain show all the time. It's right in the center of the strip so the location is good if that's what you're looking for. 

Nice size bathroom with a nice tub and shower but he towels were like cardboard and the TP was the cheap stuff. If you travel you know what I mean. Holiday Inn Express has better towels and TP. 

They charged for internet ($15\/24 hrs) and it's not wi-fi. I hate that, I can get free wi-fi at a Super 8. They claim they don't charge ""resort fees"" but if I can get it free at a much cheaper ""Motel"" I'm not buying that claim. 

The pool is not great at all considering it's Vegas. They do have a ""no kids"" pool so that's a plus for me but it's a pretty boring pool. Day beds were $50 and Cabanas were $199 w\/ a bottle included. 

Casino is fun the Go Go girls dancing above the card tables were certainly entertaining. 

The couple of times I called the concierge he didn't have anything helpful. I was looking for a spa to get massages for us and PH's spa was booked. Ended up going to the Cosmopolitan (Nice Spa) I was also looking to rent a car. There is a Hertz on site but be prepared to pay a premium for that. He didn't have any other suggestions.

We ended up staying here with the fly and stay package we booked online with our friends. What's nice about Planet Hollywood is that it is smack dab in the middle of the strip making walking to most places easy to do. There is a never-ending parade to watch outside your window no matter which way you look. The second room we stayed in here was very nice indeed.

What I didn't like about Planet Hollywood: the sensory overload is not my kind of thing. There is loud music playing in the main casino area all of the time. Add that to all of the monitors mounted everywhere tuned to different channels, the general casino noise, all of the people, slots, etc and you have one bright, shiny, flashing place that never turns off. I'm sure it's just how they like it. It's just not my thing. I'm more of a quiet luxury and serenity kind of gal. Even the elevators had TV monitors on their ceilings so you did not have to miss any of the celebrity interviews while you were headed to and from your room!

Anyway, if your room is high up enough in the building (25 floors or above) and you face the strip you might be lucky enough to see plenty and still sleep through the non-stop construction. We had to change rooms but I have to give props to Planet Hollywood here. They had no problem with this and happily accommodated our request. Not only that, we were upgraded into a really nice room after that; so it worked out.

The other thing aside from the sensory overload that bothered me about staying here was the fact that if you did not use the valet parking you have to walk at least a half mile (halfway through the Miracle Mile shops) to get to the entrance to the hotel from the parking lot. I'm no exercise hater or anything but sometimes this was just not fun. Like at midnight when nothing is open and you have already walked miles in the fancy sandals that were never meant for that anyway. Like then. Then it really sucks to have to do that just to get back to your room.

Vegas has so much to offer and so many choices to appeal to everyones tastes. I don't think I would stay here again. I'd just as soon try one of the others for a different experience and take on the Vegas scene.",7,6,7

They use a flat sheet on the bed vs fitted but either it does not fit or they pull it so high that the bottom does not cover the mattress pad. I had to remake the bed each night to avoid the uncomfortable bunching and our feet on a mattress pad that most often is not changed.

Usually when I talk to my friends who visit Vegas they always recommend PH because its a hip, young and modern hotel. What they fail to mention is how gross it is.

Sure, the lobby is adjacent to Rockbar and Earl of Sandwich. And my room window was cool because it was straight on The Bellagio Million Dollar Fountain. But let's just be real here, that's its only winning quality.

The hotel it self is super worn out. It seems stuffy and dusty all the time. The hotel hallways always seem full of junky take out service and the cleaning carts are always left hanging around blocking the way. I mean, I was out all day and that night *ahem* morning when I stumbled back in, the hallways were hard to walk through because it seems like the cleaning staff here doesn't clear that stuff. At least make sure the hallways are clear every few hours, there's gross old food on those service carts that was out for hours!!

And during my stay the elevator failed twice. Almost closing on my cousin's fiance --- literally the doors were going to shut as he was walking in...it was pressing on to his back, shut. Dangerous! Luckily, a guard came to help the door open.

Also, when we got our room, which we requested to be on the non-smoking floor. Which, I know its Vegas, but c'mon in my sleeping quarters? Yeah the hallway was full of smoke and the smoke was seeping into my room. Like a big mega cloud of smoke. I'm sure there was more than one room full of smokers...gross.

In addition to that on the same floor my cousin's room had stains on the sheets while my bathroom sink was clogged and the batteries in my tv remote were dead.

That's the last time I stay in that wannabe modern hotel. I'd give them zero stars if I could. I'm giving one star for the window view and one star for Earl of Sandwich.  If you got some dolla dollas spend them elsewhere.",4,1,1

I found the staff at the pool 21 black jack tables to be super talkative and friendly as well as the waitresses.  They were on top of it with drinks! They kept them coming.

 The indoor casino staff on the other hand was quiet, slow and not friendly at all. It's like they hated their jobs. They were a total buzz kill.

The room was kind of crappy. We got upgraded to a bigger room but the view was horrible and the window rarely filled the room with enough light. It's the room themed after the movie ""Made in America."" Yes it was large but I'd rather get a smaller room that got more light!

The food at this hotel is great! They have Starbucks, Earl of Sandwich and Gordon Ramseys Burgr (no this is not misspelled lol) to name a few. Fantastic!

So we checked in about 10:30 am and I had done some research and determined if there was an early check in fee or not, and it cost $22.46 to do so. No big deal we had a long flight and wanted to eat and take a break. So, as far as the room we booked a ""Ultra Hip Room"" for about $109.00 a night through a third party site I have used for years. The front desk put us in the North tower all the way on the 23rd floor. The room itself was clean and actually very spacious ( as seen in the photos). This hotel is still going through renovations and were taking place on the floor we were on.

We booked a non-smoking room which sadly was smoked in. The room was quiet and the shower was nice and clean and was furnished with a mini fridge, couch, several chairs and a table. 

The hotel itself, smoke, smoke, everywhere is what you will smell on the casino floor. I have no issues being a former smoker but when you just don't want to be around it this was not the place. The elevators where similar to ashtrays and looked like worn out catchers mitts. The hotel seems as if it is attempting to adjust to the millennial crowd which they are failing at. Millennials do not gamble. They want experiences and Planet Hollywood Casino misses the boat.

We arrived early so our room was not ready.  We checked our bags at the bell desk.  When our room was ready, we went back to get our bags from the bell desk.  It was a very busy weekend, however, when my maid of honor asked if we could take the dolly up to our suite with all of our bags the bell desk said, ""No.""  Then she asked if someone would help us with our bags up to our room and he again said, ""No.""  I was unaware that this happened until we got up to the room.  So I called the front desk to speak to the manager, whom apologized.  I also asked for more towels.  30 minutes later, we still had no towels, so I called housekeeping to ask for towels.  They said they'd bring them right up.  Our group of ladies had to share towels because we were getting ready to go out.  At this point it had been an hour.  I called again, and they said they were backed up and had someone on their way.  So I asked them to leave the towels in our room so they would at least be there when we returned from a night out.  We went to a club and two of my friends came back at 1am--STILL NO TOWELS!  So my friend called the manager irate.  The only way we got towels was because my friend told the manager to stay on the phone until we got our towels.  This had been 8 hours from the initial request for the towels.

This is a suite, mind you, that we spend over $1,000 on for the weekend.  

The bar area in our suite had a wet carpet, from some sort of leak.  The front door was cracked, like someone had punched it, or tried banging the door open or closed.

We brought food up to the room the first night and left our trash outside the front door.  The person who brought towels did not take the trash.  The next day, when someone asked us if we wanted room service, did not take the trash away.  We ordered room service the next day and he did not take the trash down after delivering our food.  

After two nights and three days, our trash from the first day was still outside our doors.

To top off this awful experience, when we were getting ready to check out on Sunday, we noticed on the opposite side of the suite there was a large men's white tee shirt left on the table.  It had yellow stains and was none of ours!  THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

We took the shirt downstairs and showed it to the gentleman at the front desk who checked us out.  He was so apologetic and could not believe we even touched the shirt.  

We could have stayed anywhere on the strip, where hospitality and competition is high.  We could have spent over $1,000 at any other place and I'm sure would have had a better time.  
My bachelorette party was only great due to the friends I was with.  Planet Hollywood is awful and I will never stay there again, nor would I wish this experience on anyone.  I felt bad for my group of ladies who spent plenty of money to celebrate my marriage and I feel that I let them down by this experience.  I don't even know what else to say.",0,0,0

Next, I walked into the bathroom.  The shower was pretty ugly.  Old stained tile, worn drain, very simple faucet\/shower head.  Definitely nothing special.  Then, I walked to the sink to check out the soap & other goodies that were provided and noticed a hair in the sink.  Ick!  Whatever . . . Moved on to the bathtub. Multiple pieces of hair in the tub!!!  Gross!!! Had to use the facilities & noticed yet another hair on the floor next to the toilet.  Either housekeeping is too rushed or just doesn't care.  

At that point, we called the front desk to get another room.  This time we got an upgrade to a larger room.  When I looked in the bathroom of the new room, another hair (very long, dark hair) was sitting on the towel layed across the oversized bathtub.  The soap was placed on top of the hair so it was sandwiched between the towel and box of soap.  Did not bother to call and complain again, but did not use that towel, that soap, or that bathtub during our 2 night stay.
We saw the Peep Show starring Coco Austin. My husband and I liked the music.  I'm a big Coco fan so enjoyed seeing her, but the story-line is kind of cheesy & doesn't make much sense.  We saw the show previously when Holly Madison starred and it was completely unchanged years later.  I think they could stand to update it a bit.

The restaurants\/bars: Ate at YoLo's, Planet Dailies, and the buffet.  Food was ok.  I'd give it 3 stars across the board for the food itself.  The prices were pretty high for what you get.  For example, a simple Reuben is like $13. That seems inexpensive however when you compare it to prices at the pool bar where my husband's Bacardi Diet Coke was $15.  
Speaking of the pool, there are 2 pools which have a very simple shape. Nothing special about them.  They are holes in the ground filled with water.  Even the Flamingo has a nicer pool.  I would also recommend Caesar's, the Mirage, or the Cosmopolitan pools over this one.  

The spa:Not worth purchasing a day pass because there isn't much in there. It's old and the them is obviously left over from when this hotel was the Aladin.  This theme no longer fits this hotel.  The services do not follow the theme either like I have seen them do at many other Vegas spas.  Services are WaY Overpriced!!!!  Even for a Vegas spa.  Believe me, I have been to Qua @ Caesars & this is nowhere near as nice, but they still charge over $200 for a facial.  AnD . . . You are paying that much and the staff acts like they couldn't care less that you are there.  other than the ""nameste"" greeting you receive when you walk in the door, they do not make any effort to make you feel appreciated, special, etc.  

Facial itself was excellent, but I was asked if I'd like to have microdermabrasion and glycolic application during my facial.  I said, ""sure.""  Next, she tells me it was going to be a $20 upgrade charge.  She asked if that would be alright.  I agreed because I was using comps anyway and already spending over $200 as it was so what's another $20, right?  Well, when I went to check out, the guy @ the front desk said the upgrade was $25.  I explained to him I was quoted $20, but he insisted it was $25 & that I had already had the treatment and that I would need to pay for it.  I tried fighting him on it one more time but to no avail. 

We came to this hotel with the intention of using our $1000 comp dollars so we charged everything to the room.  Our final bill for 2 days was $644.  My husband checked out while I was finishing up at the spa.  They told him our comps covered all except $103 of our bill.  They charged our credit card the remaining amount!!!!  What?!?  We should have had more than enough comps.  So, my husband tells me this when I get out of the spa as we are driving away from the hotel.  I couldn't believe it and immediately called to try to resolve this.  The lady on the phone said the same thing . . .   All comps on both our players club cards had been used.  I could not believe this.  So, once we flew home, I looked online today and I still had $430 left in comps on my card!!!  What kind of idiots do they have working there?!?!  So, I called again TODAY and finally got someone who saw the comps and agreed to refund the amount charged to the credit card and instead take the $103 out of my comps.  

Such a stressful trip there was more frustration than fun.  My advice would be not to go to Planet Hollywood unless you want to be surrounded by a staff who doesn't give a shit that you are there from the valets to the bellmen to the waiters to the dealers.  They really don't care about you which is unfortunate since you are forking out a lot of money overpaying for subpar quality everything.

I had booked a Fri-Tues stay at Planet Hollywood in a Resort Room with a king bed.  I was put in room 1272, as I jokingly referred to it, the ""'Speed' Suite"".   My room was spacious and clean with plenty of photos of Keanu Reeves and ""Speed"" memorabilia decorating the room.  Some of the furnishing were showing a little wear and tear and were a bit dated from a design perspective.  However, the mattress offered good support and the bed and bedding overall provided a good night's sleep.  My room was tucked in the corner property so it was didn't receive much direct sunlight into the room, which actually was a blessing for sleeping in.  The bathroom was disproportionately large with two sinks and vanities, a separate tub and shower, and a separate water closet.  Water pressure in the shower wasn't great although it may be more attributable to the dated, possibly partially clogged, showerhead, than the lack of pressure in the line.  Of note, though, hot water seemed to be in somewhat shorter supply in the morning hours, but never a problem in the evening. 

As for gambling, I like to play where I stay and the bulk of my gambling was at the Planet Hollywood.  I'm primarily a blackjack player, but I also played some craps.  Planet Hollywood was the biggest surprise from a gaming perspective during this trip to Las Vegas.  Most of its blackjack tables except for those in the Pleasure Pit were 3:2 games although all of them were at $25 or $50 minimums.  These payouts and minimums were consistent throughout the entire week and at all hours.  They did have $15 tables, but they were 6:5.  The Pleasure Pit tables, when in operation, were $25 minimums at 6:5 payouts.  Sorry, but the spectacle of being able to watch an attractive, scantily-clad woman dance on a small stage while you gamble wasn't worth the lesser payout.  PH's craps tables during the daytime hours were $10 minimums, which seemed on the low end for the Strip.  Odds were the standard 3x4x5.  As for other aspects of the property, dining and drinking options really haven't kept up with its competitors or even other Caesars properties.  No matter, Planet Hollywood sits on prime Strip real estate conveniently located to near lots of places to eat, drink and play.

In the past, Planet Hollywood had been a property that I'd occasionally stay, but it rarely was my first, second, or even third choice.  This time out, it really made a positive impression, especially with its appealing blackjack payouts at many of its tables, which (for the moment) are resisting the horrible Las Vegas trend towards 6:5 blackjack games.  Planet Hollywood has made me reassess my ranking of it as a place to stay and play for future trips to Las Vegas.",5,2,3

The line was probably 50 people deep at 6:00 PM.  At the rate it was moving it would have taken 2 hours to get a room.  We had tickets to Cirque Du Soleil ""O"" so we had to check our bags at the bell desk and go to the show. We came back at 10:00 ish and the line was 40 deep so we went to dinner to waste time.  At about 11:00 we came back completely exhausted and had to wait in line. it was about 30-35 deep and took us an hour to get to the front. So at midnight I finally get a room.. I was pissed but there were other folks with babies and small children stuck in line... All the while they had 2 perky employees hardly busy for the VIP check-in, so instead of them helping out the normal backlog they stood relatively idle.. So, once I got to the front of the line I asked them ""how are you going to compensate me for standing in line for one hour - drink coupons, what?"". The replay was.. NOTHING.. Fukking nothing for standing in line for one hour just to check in at midnight.. Also, the timeshare choads that they let prowl their halls are rude, unprofessional scumbags.. they insulted my girlfriend after she rightly refused their crappy deal and told her ""she didn't make enough to buy a timeshare"".. Bottom line is that unless you are a stupid moron with a lot of time to waste and tons of cash to throw down the toilet.. don't bother staying there because you are not the type they like..",8,5,3

We got the handicap access room where there is an open shower instead of a stall. The shower drain clogged, breaking the plastic barrier and ultimately flooded our bathroom. While the maintenance crew drilled, snaked, and scraped the bathroom, they had to use 24 towels to soak up the water (which they told us would be cleaned up). 

Hours later we returned to see the bathroom hadn't been cleaned and the two dozen towels were left in a huge wet pile in front of the toilet. There was some sort of communication breakdown because they brought extra towels but no one to clean up the mess. 

The front desk staff didn't offer to anything in return for the inconvenience except a smoking room because they were booked. They only reluctantly gave us a hotel credit after we asked, but we still got charged for gratuity (Even though we generously tipped the staff).

Its smack dab right in the middle, putting you in close walking distance to many of the major hotels and attractions on the Strip.  Its also attached to the Miracle Mile shops and restaurants (complete with two ABC Stores!).  Very convenient if you just want a quick bite to eat without breaking your wallet and want to do some shopping without leaving the hotel and going out into the cold.  In terms of the room, upon check-in, we were given a free upgrade without having to ask...score!  Room was admittedly dimly lit, but clean and spacious.  Nice flat screen TV with select HD channels.  

The Bad: Many of the staff members appeared ambivalent about their jobs and were for the most part, unhelpful.  We were also hounded by PH's timeshare ""greeters"" until we agreed to sign up for a presentation.  Seriously, they would not stop harassing us.  Set our alarm the next morning to go to the presentation, only to be told at the door that wait, we couldn't attend because we didn't qualify.  WTH?  We had given our income level and info downstairs, but apparently they couldn't be bothered to check if we qualified...they were more interested in making the sale.  What a waste of time.  Also, housekeeping comes by early...at 9am...and pretty much will just knock once, say ""housekeeping,"" and enter the room without waiting for a response.  We told them to come back later as we were still sleeping, and they did, every hour on the hour until the room got cleaned.  Sheesh.  Lastly, if you ask for a non-smoking room, make sure they don't put smokers next door to you.  The smoke wafted through the vents and under the door, filling our room with the stench and essentially turned our non-smoking room into a smoking one.  These smokers were also college drunks who kept yelling and pounding on the walls at 3:30am like they were trying to kick a hole in the wall.  Luckily, this happened on the last night of our stay, otherwise I would have asked for a room change or at least called security.

A tiny window so not much natural light coming through. There wasn't any main switch for the lights so you had to manually turn each of them on.

I booked it through Vegas.com, which we had other issues with, and the hotel room wasn't great.  Very small, and none of the basic amenities. No fridge, no coffeemaker, half a closet that you can barely fit anything into.  Only allowed to have WiFi for one device.  And having them bring up a mini fridge is an extra charge. So ridiculous.  Just disappointing overall.  

I mean even the nozzle on the shower still said Aladdin - really?? You didn't even bother to change that? I'm sure all the furniture is the old Aladdin furniture too, because it was tiny and old-looking. 

We had issues with Vegas.com not telling us there is a new resort fee policy of $20 extra a night that is not included in your original purchase. (I've been a customer for a long time and they never notified me that their Terms and Conditions had changed, which I read before the new policy was added).

I understand that the fee issue is Vegas.com's fault, but when the PH Towers were still around, and I had an issue with Orbitz at the time not giving me the suite I paid for and just gave us a normal tiny room, the manager of the Towers called them for me and talked to them about it. He helped us fix the problem!  These employees at Planet Hollywood didn't even bother to try at all to help us.  The only thing they did was waive the fee for bringing up a mini fridge, and then they stuck it in the bathroom! Gross. They should consider adding more outlets in the room. 

The only good thing is the mall, and the hotel location.  The pool is eh. Small, nothing special.

first off, the view was spectacular! location is on point (center of strip). 

stayed in the jacuzzi suite. it was really basic. honestly, i was expecting it to be fancy or at least with a jacuzzi that didn't resemble a plain old tub and one that could hold more than one person. it's ok though. it's vegas! you shouldn't be stuck in the hotel all day long unless you're gambling.  

hmm.. what i liked about it was its simplicity. there were a few of charlie sheen's belongings displayed. other than that, nothing special.

the bed is comfy; ""clean"" is a different story which i'll get to.. no fridge and very little closet space (didn't matter to me; i never use the closet). there are no locks for the bathroom doors. *take note if you're rooming with others.  their shampoo and body wash sucked, but it's all good.

comforter was nasty!  a certain area of it smelled like B.O. haha and i didn't notice it til i woke up the next morning.. i know for a fact it wasn't me or my husband. we don't smell 'that' bad when we sweat! i threw it onto the carpet and saw shredded chicken underneath, like someone was eating a taco and used the comforter as a napkin. what!

for that reason i'm going back to never trusting hotel comforters.  they probably never change them.

i forgot to mention that the walls are thin so you can hear your neighbors' conversations. we kept our  DO NOT DISTURB sign on & twice i woke up to the housekeeper's entrance (attempted entrance as the deadbolt lock was on). they're really noisy in the morning. 

overall, ph was alright. got the room comp for five nights (thanks to ma uncle) so i can't really complain. we ended up staying only for three nights though...cuz i was complaining. lol.

I had arranged a room upgrade before coming but upon check-in was told it had not been implemented. I was in no mood to discuss it having just humped through half of the Miracle Mile to get from the self park parking lot to the registration desk at which I could not hear the clerk due to the thudding of the obnoxious ""music"" that was coming discordantly from several different sources. I signed, paid for our five night stay and closed  closed the bill so no incidentals would be added.

The room was not bad but it was no deluxe and the view consisted of pressing to a small window in the corner and peering out a badly water-spotted window at the lovely roof below and the construction crane beyond it. I believe that since they fumbled the check-in, they should eat the cost of our lavish room in which the closet door would not close with clothes in it and there was only one chair.

The vast majority of hotel staff and even other guests were fine with my well-behaved dog walking to and from our room with me. Many were pet-owners themselves, and were very friendly and accommodating. 

However, since the whole program was clearly an afterthought, it is not the most convenient setup. To get to the ""pet relief area"" at PH, you have to walk through the lobby, up the valet driveway, and then cross several lanes of taxi traffic. Since you're already outdoors for most of the trek, my dog would occasionally want to start doing his thing before we got there. Which is embarrassing enough, but then a valet attendant decided to take it upon himself to tell me that we shouldn't stay at the hotel, and even threateningly ask for my room number, as if he was going to do something. If he HAD tried anything, well, then we would have seen what happened. 

Overall, not worth the hassle. For pet owners, the pet rooms usually list for about $50 more than the regular ""resort,"" don't have much in the way of deals\/comps, and seem to be limited to a particular block (low floor, no view). They may or may not waive the $56\/nt pet fee as well. Leave the pups at home and stay at a nicer hotel for the same price, where you may even get upgrades and such (no choice here).

If you don't have pets, I also can't see why you'd want to stay here, either (or at any Caesars properties, since they all have this policy now). Basically, the worst of both worlds, whether you're traveling with pets or not.",3,0,0

I stayed at this hotel for two nights the first day I arrived I had to complain about the room spelling like smoke, and the towels that where dirty. The first night I used one of the bath dry towels turn it over and it had a blood stain on it. I went downstairs to talk to a manager and they gave me a $71 resort fee credit for the inconvenience. They never tried to switch my room or even acted like they were concerned. The next day after being out of the room for hours I came back to relax and the toilet was clogged it took maintenance over three hours to come and fix the plumbing issues. At this point I am over it and ready to go home to add to the ongoing problems I used on of their face cloths to was my face and I woke up with an itchy burning face around 5 AM in the morning my face was broke out in a horrible rash. I immediately got my things together and checked out around 7 AM that morning I tried to talk to another manager to advise what happened but the lady that checked me out had no sense of concern what so ever so I left. When I got home I called the hotel to explain the issues to see what was the proper steps to take to report the rash that I got from the face cloth and they told me to contact security to make a report and then the risk management department will handle the rest.

I filed the report on a Wednesday I was told to give risk management 3-5 days to receive the report and then call them and provide a reference number and they would advise the next steps. I called and left a detailed message for a call back on Tuesday I did not receive a phone call back so I tried calling today I kept getting voicemail so I decided to call the hotel directly to get transferred and once I did that the lady finally answered the phone. Before I could get a word out I was rudely interrupted she than told me our insurance company will be in contact with in a nasty tone, I then asked here excuse me I will need you to explain the process before I knew it we were in a heated argument and then she hung up on me.

The suite was cool, there was a stripper pole with black lights inside which was also a shower. A foosball table and a pool table. The room was perfect for a party. It had one small standard room attached, but the ""party"" area was huge. When shopping around this room definitely was not the cheapest. With fees we paid $800 for a Sunday night reservation. We booked here because the agent convinced us this would be the best place to have our party, that they would be so accommodating and we would have the best holiday party ever. So we checked in around 3 just tk bring the food up and get ready, guests came at 8. Right when our guests arrived at 8 PM IN LAS VEGAS we got a noise complaint because we were playing music. We obliged and turned the music down although it hadn't seemed to be at Un unreasonable volume. About a half an hour later we got another knock on the door, it was security again saying that our music needed to be turned off. Now, we are in a suite with surround sound but ok, we took what they said and turned the music completely off. About 40 minutes later they came back saying they were going to evict us from out room because they can hear people talking and the pool table. At this point we asked to speak to the hotel manager because we were more than transparent about the intended use of the room, and this is a group of business professionals not rowdy teenagers. The experience of our apex suite definitely reached its apex when assistant hotel manager Brian came up. You could tell he was completely under qualified and\/or green in his position because his customer service was the worst I have ever seen. He said he he gave us the third warning and that was all like he was going to do. I spoke with him in a completely professional manner, I live and work in this town. I am a customer service general manager on the Las Vegas strip. I told him I value that he values the stay of all of his guests whether they paid $69 for a guest room or $800 for a suite. But that it is 930 pm and we have done everything they have asked. It is unreasonable for them to ask that we not speak or use amenities that are provided to make this room what it is. I even offered as frustrated and as inconvenienced as it would be that our entire party would be willing to move to another room or even another Ceasar's entertainment property. I asked what his occupancy of the hotel was and what he could do to rectify the situation of that we are just as inconvenienced and upset as whomever is complaining I assure you. He kept incessantly rolling his eyes, shaking his head and walking away and back up to the conversation. He told us that his hands were tied on moving us and and doing ANYTHING for us customer service wise because we had booked though a third party. We told him we did not book through a third party we booked through the number from the Planet Hollywood Web site and Planet Hollywood was on the statement of the charge. He said to contact them and walked away. The security guards that were left standing there kept continually apologizing. Saying they hadn't seen anything like this, they are being made to do this and if they were us they would be extremely pissed. They don't think we are being overly loud and everything we have asked has been more than reasonable. So we went back into the room and did what he said, called the number we booked from which rang to Planet Hollywood and Ceasar's entertainment. The man on the phone said that we had indeed booked through Planet Hollywood and he was so sorry he was going to get in touch with the manager to get this resolved. I waited on hold for 20 minutes. He came back on the phone and said he had no idea how to say this and that it'd going to sound rude but that it wasn't coming from him, but that the front desk manager (our friend Brian) refuses to speak to us or about our situation, goodnight. He then kept apologizing saying he had no idea what to do. He would have been more than happy to help us but he can't without front desk approval. We called Ceasar's Palace to see of they could help us and they were so nice and felt awful but they needed it to come from Planet Hollywood's front desk as well so they couldn't do anything. The nice woman on the phone said she would go down to the front desk where we could be seen and make them speak to us there. So we took her advice, went down to the front desk where we met David, the new manager on duty. He told us again that he was not going to help us, that we booked through a third party and Brian's notes say nothing further will be done for us. But that the room is still ours the two people that checked in can stay. I kept telling him that we DID NOT BOOK THROUGH A THIRD PARTY AND I'M SICK OF HEARING THIS.

Even if I was still in the party scene, I would not stay here ever again though since they expect guests to party without coffee.  

There are seriously no coffee makers in the room.  Even janky motels on the outskirts of Atlantic City provide this benefit for its guests so I was shocked when the front desk operator told us we could ""order room service coffee if we wanted to.""  At $8 a pot of coffee or tea, no thank you.

As far as the rest of the room, it was serviceable.  Because we checked in relatively late, we were given a dual queen room with a handicapped shower.  The beds were comfortable and we had a great view of the Cosmopolitan and the other hotels across the street that we most likely would have liked much better out the window (but are there any bad views in Las Vegas?).  The television was large and it mostly worked (the remote control was pretty slow but that's par for the course at casinos).  So the room was relaxing at least.

Having all of the Miracle Miles stores and restaurants closeby is a perk of staying here as opposed to many other casinos.  But I had an amazingly tough time finding the exit to these places.  I had a hard time finding my out of this casino in general.  In a way that few others have stumped me.  It is maze involving multiple party pits and dancing dealers.  If that's your thing, this casino might be for you.  But I spent all of $8.50 playing multi-hand video blackjack here the whole weekend.

Honestly, I never thought I'd find a Caesars property worse than Bally's in Atlantic City but this one might take that ""prize"" for sure.",6,1,1

Like many other hotels on the Strip, we arrived on a side street and into the lower level of the hotel where the parking is and where the lobby is located.  The rest of the public spaces for Planet Hollywood and the casino is on the second floor, which makes the pedestrian access to Planet Hollywood on the elevated sidewalk \/plaza a floor above Las Vegas Boulevard.

We checked in and got upgraded to a larger room!  Not sure why we were upgraded.  The room was large and adequately appointed.  The room had a large foyer that seemed like a waste of space.  It could easily have been cut in half and added to the bathroom, but the bathroom was already huge.  A counter on each side with a sink in each counter.  Shower and soaking tub.  Great.

Housekeeping was great.  We noticed two light bulbs out in our room.  I told a housekeeper and it got fixed before we returned.  

Everyone at Planet Hollywood was very nice.  Hard rock band in one of the lounges playing for free.  Scantily clad gals dancing on platforms in the middle of the casino - nice touch!  Big sports book action.  

Easy access to the Miracle Mile shopping mall, Axis theater for the Britney Spears show, and the V Theater for some smaller shows.  20 min. walk to Showcase Mall, or to Caesars, and across the street from the Cosmopolitan.  Good location on the Strip that can save a little money on taxis.

Two pools.  Adequate.  Easy check in around 8p on a Friday night.  Free Wi-Fi for guests because you already paid for the $25 daily resort fee.",0,0,0

-Location:  It's a terrific spot, central to the whole strip and attached to the Miracle Mile Shops...makes is the perfect spot all year round, regardless of weather

-Starbucks: inside the hotel...if you're a coffee junkie, it's right there for you!

-Food: Not the place for world renowned cuisine, but they do offer some great ""chain"" style choices like PF Changs, Earl of Sandwhich and various others attached to the MIracle Mile.  

-Bathrooms: Double Sinks, sunken tub very cool.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The drawbacks:

-Nothing major, the suites are average but clean and well appointed.  For the money, it's not a bad choice

-The Casino is really not for us...it's small, dark and plays the same 5 hip hop songs over and over and over and over again all night.  I like to play the tables late at night and it's just too dark and makes you feel like it's a cloudy day.  

-The Pool...again, nothing bad here, just not as big or as ""wow factor"" as others I've seen.  

Overall, I would try another hotel in the same price range before I returned.  I cannot say it was a bad stay, so give it a try if this is the price range you're looking for.

My first stay at PH was in May 2011.  My husband and I were both excited to stay on the Strip for our first Vegas trip together, as PH is well located for sight-seeing and casino hopping.  At the time, we were pleased with our room and the overall hotel, though the pool area left a lot to be desired.
    Fast forward to 2014:  Upon arrival, we found the check-in process to be quick and pleasant.  The lobby and casino still appear to be sparkly and well-maintained.  Upon entering the elevators we were confronted with the first signs of wear and tear - dented and scuffed elevator doors and dirty floors.  When we disembarked on our floor, we noticed the carpets were stained and bubbling up in sections of the hallway.  The wallpaper was marked and there were actual dents in the walls.  We held our breath when opening the door to our upgraded room, a Junior Suite.
     Surprisingly the room afforded a great deal of space, as the bathroom seemed to be the size of a standard room, with a giant soaking tub, separate shower and toilet closet.  The décor is not dated but feels worn.  That, coupled with the obvious smell of stale smoke (in a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor) and a mystery stain on the armchair in the room, did little to inspire great confidence in the cleanliness of the facilities.  The bed was comfortable but the pillows were awful, too flat or lumpy and much too firm. The most disappointing aspect of the room though, was the lack of a mini-fridge or minibar.  As we were traveling with a group of friends and knew we would be spending some time in the room, we thought we would keep a few cold beverages on-hand to while away the time.  Alas it was not meant to be, as they obviously want you out of the room and on the casino floor. 
      The pool is as bad as I remember from 2011.  The deck is a giant, white, concrete space, with chairs arranged around an outside bar.  You can't actually see either pool from the deck, you have to walk up a flight of stairs and try to wrangle space around the pool itself.  Of course, you could pay extra for a daybed or cabana next to the pool.  These ""extras"", however, are no cleaner than the regular chaise lounges.  The daybeds all have stains on them and the cabanas are just slightly less dirty.
      Overall, the state of the hotel beyond the public areas, is disappointing.  For the price, inflated at checkout by the accompanying Resort Fee and other add-ons, I expected more.  I rated it 3 stars due to its location, the good restaurants within the casino itself and their customer service.",1,0,0

There are about a million steps that they could have taken to prevent me from writing this review but none were even attempted. The first issue was when Planet Hollywood claimed that Expedia had canceled our reservation (Expedia said they had not). The front desk staff then dismissed us and told us to basically ""deal with it"" ourselves. When we insisted that this was a mistake they made no attempt to contact Expedia themselves and see what the problem was (although I asked them to please help us by doing so), instead we were forced to take over an hour out of our workday to do a ridiculous back and forth ""he said she said"" between Expedia (who said the reservation had never been canceled) and the reservation desk until absolutely nothing was resolved.

Instead of taking any responsibility for it they said it was our fault for thinking that Expedia would get it right. We must be complete idiots thinking that Expedia, one of the largest booking sites out there, wouldn't cancel our reservation for no reason (which they still claim they had never even done). I understand that glitches happen, but when they do anyone with decent service skills would at least attempt to work this out with the agency instead of punishing their guests. Worst case, if this was absolutely something they could not get resolved with the Expedia they should have at least treated their guests with enough respect to attempt to apologize, attempt to work it out with the agency themselves, upgraded our room in an attempt to say sorry for all the hassle they caused us, or even just having SAID I'M SORRY FOR ALL THIS HASSLE. Nothing was done. They were very rude to us and I highly encourage anyone else who has similar experiences with this awful service to speak up and continue to take their ratings down to what they deserve until they learn to treat their guests with decency. It's fine to put on a happy face and be nice when there's no issue with your booking, but the real quality of service comes out when there is the slightest glitch. 

This was the initial woman at the front desk and her manager who were rude and completely unhelpful. After explaining the whole situation to the woman at the front desk, we spoke to the manager who additionally treated us with disbelief and disrespect and acted like the whole ordeal was our fault. We were checking in waiting awkwardly for over an hour trying to sort this ordeal out. I've seen reviews on here of people who were upgraded after checkin took them a whopping 25 minutes. No one attempted to do anything to try to compensate us or even say sorry. 

I see people writing bad reviews on here because they had to pay a resort fee or wouldn't get free toothpaste. We know how hotels work. We were totally willing to pay what was fair and not expect anything other then basic respect and decency and the reservation staff completely failed. In the end we only booked 1\/5 nights, not wanting to give these awful people our money. Now we have to spend even more time out of our day tomorrow moving hotels.

What they have going for them is the Miracle Mile, Earl of Sandwich, BurGR, and location.

I've been spoiled by the likes of Vdara and Cosmo, and am staying here because I got a great package deal on Southwest. Knowing how cheap I got it, I was fine with the idea that PH is not going to be as nice. However, I wasn't prepared at how filthy it would be!

Resort Room #1: I was disappointed at how yellow, dark and dingy the room is. The lights are very dim. Hand prints all over the windows. Remote didn't work. The ""Hollywood"" relics looked like it was just randomly placed in the room. I asked to be moved to a different room.

Resort Room #2: It didn't get any better.
- Unidentifiable and suspicious stains on the window. It was evident that the efforts made to clean the windows were half-assed (like wiping it once and leaving half of a handprint still visible with streaks).
- As I was taking a bath, I noticed something green floating around me. Looks like an old sponge from the previous guest. Ew.
- Black, mold-like substance around the bathtub drain.
- scuff marks and chipped paint on the dressers and bathroom sinks. 

Please train your housekeepers to be more thorough with their cleaning. I would have been way happier to have a late check-in into a clean room.

Also, the parking lot is the same as the Miracle Mile Shops which is a big trek to get to your rooms.

2.  Poker Room:  Tough to call it a poker room since it's not really blocked off.  It's more like a bunch of poker tables in the middle of the casino.  Regardless, some fun and good games here, especially on the weekends.

Immediately when you walk in, the lobby welcomes you with a cool and lounge-like ambiance. The rooms were very spacious and had very nice furniture and a 42"" Flat screen. The beds were pillow top Sealys which were very comfy. The sheets had a high thread count since I kept running my hands over them. 

Now the casino. The new PleasurePit is the main casino floor and all of the girls wear fishnet stockings, boy shorts, and a corset. Not only the garments are hot but the girls are not bad at all.

PH also houses the PEEP Show and the new club Gallery. I didn't have a chance to visit either but I'm sure I'll visit PH very soon. Definitely recommended!",0,0,0

I arrived at the hotel around 10am and there was a $28 fee for early check-in.  That was fine with me because I just wanted to get situated in the room.  

The agent who checked us in was extremely cold!  I want to say her name was Charmaine or something like that, but I'm not sure if I'm making that up?  Anyways, I work in the service industry so I have an idea how things work at hotels.  When asking her certain questions, she would ignore me.  I found myself asking multiple times before she would finally look up from the computer and spew out half-assed answers.  I thought once again, fine.  She probably hates her job.

Onto the room!  I actaully liked it; I found it quaint.  The beds were comfortable and I loved the bathroom.  We had the Brandon Lee room which I found amusing because my boyfriend always makes me watch Bruce and Brandon Lee movies.  That's all the positive I can say about the room.  Everything else you have to pay for, like a fridge?  But I guess that's typical of Vegas?

On the plus side, I really enjoyed the casino!  I was winning money on those penny slots!  They also had a good variety of games.  The mall was pretty cool too and the hotel was conviently located on the strip.  This little tidbit is the only reason this place is getting 3 stars, and that's being generous.

All in all, the rooms are nice, but that's not enough to make me a loyal guest.  This place nickle and dimes you and gives shitty service!  No thanks!  I will probably come back soley for the casino.",3,0,0

The room was just OK. But I find the scene they had going on in the room a bit creepy. My parents had the room decorated with pictures from Interview with the Vampire, while we stayed at room 911 with Robin Williams pictures all over. The tub was nice tho. 

They also don't have their own parking garage and share one with the mall and other casinos. So the walk from parking to their hotel took a while and it was confusing.

The valet is FREE so drive up to the hotel entrance and let them park it for you. We unfortunately didn't so I had to drag my poor, sick mom about 2 miles through a shopping center before we got to the check in. The check in line was very long... 

BUT Once we got up there, the service was outstanding, they upgraded our rooms and we got a free bottle of alcohol for each suite. The suites are absolutely gorgeous! We got strip views and extravagant bathrooms with giant bath tubs. The one in my parents' room was so huge you could fit 5 people in there easily. 
The decor is classy and fun - different movie memorabilia in each room. The bed was like a cloud!!! I wish we could have brought it home.

It sounds attractive - it's no charge (you can park your own car or use valet). So we used it.  Then after checkout at 11am, we asked for our car. They said 20mins. They took closer to 30mins, and that was after we had escalated and jumped the queue. They said it was busy that day.

They were not able to change our rooms due to the fact that there were no other rooms available. I then ask to speak to a manager, which was not available to assist with my complaint due to being the ONLY manager on duty and the person I spoke with was not apologetic in regards to my issue.

Anyways my first time here was for my cousin's bachelorette. We stayed in a suite with 2 rooms, kitchen, living room, jacuzzi annnnd stripper! So much fun! perfect space for 10 females. I enjoyed the jazucci - their pool (outside) was nice a spacious enough to find a perfect spot to tan. 

We were in the tower that didnt have the slots :( so we had to walk to the other tower... which is perfect it gave us a reason to walk around and get that exercise.

I was actually pretty damn impressed with the casino itself.  In fact my wife loved it so much she wants to stay here from now on when we come to Vegas.   

I can not speak for the rooms but the casino itself it well laid out.  They have free parking in the back.  The only issue is that to get to the casino you HAVE TO walk through all the Miracle Mile Shops in the back.  The only way around them would be to be dropped off on the side or the front of the casino.  Its a pretty long walk from the parking garage through those shops, but they are really nice shops so you can always do some window shopping.

With Vegas Strip casinos its all about location.  This used to be the Aladdin Casino back in the day (its where Elvis got married).  Its right across from the Bellagio and right next door to Paris and the Flamingo.

Parking was packed once i finally got to vegas around late 12ish, i had to park on the 4th floor. I'm not the one to complain about how far I parked but better lighting couldve helped. I think P.H. needs to work on how their hotel guests could find a easier and CLOSER way to the lobby. Seriously my bf and i had to walk all around the miracle mile shops with our luggagge and people staring at us. Idgaf about the staring  but thats kinda bad on the hotel b\/c guests who pay good $$ to stay here have to drag their belongings to the lobby area. Probably a good 20 mins we got to the lobby, line was super long...i got to the front desk...first the employee said she couldnt ""find"" a room with 1 king size bed, theyre not ready , etc...she had offered a 2 twin bedroom next to the elevator and asked ""if that was okay?""

-___________- IS IT OKAY? heck no, i had asked her politely that when i booked the room in may that I had wrote on the guest's preferrance\/special accomdations box that i would like 1 king size room, non smoking, & on a floor higher than the 10th floor (bc i wanted a view and not stick to the smoking designated floors below.) she said okay then it was totally dead silent for 15mins looking at her computer then she finally looked up from the screen & told me she was looking for another room....and 5mins passed..she magically found a room on 22nd floor w\/ 1 king sized bed. i took that, room keys were set and apologized also for everything..which i def am glad she did apologize..just a lil dissapointed as well b\/c i had mentioned that when i called a day earlier and asked if i could pay in cash for the room..some employee said yes you can..but when i got there i couldnt and it had to be on a credit card...which i didnt mind either way but cmon they need to educate their front desk on communicating with each other.

my bf and i got to our room, it was nice spacious room..bathroom was surprisingly huge, comfty bed, and a great view! we got a view of the bellagio watershow, our pool, cosmopolitan...it was a nice thing to see for paying for a hollywood hip room.  my only concerns about the room was that the ice bucket was real small, the sheer window blinds were halfway broken, the water pressure for the showerhead def needs a lot more improvement (other reviews have said the same as well) - i felt like you had to stand there for 10mins to even just get your hair half way wet, weird noises in the ac vents (scared me stimes in the middle of night-also another thing another reviewer had mentioned) and also they need to work on their tv's in the rooms - the remote was not functioning fast enough like you had to press it a couple of times to get to one channel and the power button the actual tv just did not want to turn the first few times...also i usually carry a couple $100 bills with me when i go to vegas and i usually leave some in the safe at any hotel i stay in vegas..and their's was broken! so i had to hide my money some place else...but cmon now...p.h. get it together! 

overall though, the room was actually clean, i had a good nights sleep every nite i was there, great view from where i was at, location was perfect b\/c it was in the middle of the strip\/plus the shops were downstairs. i probably wouldnt stay here again unless i had to...i would prob stay at monte carlo or treasure island again just b\/c i did enjoy their accomdations better plus they offer special deals and coupons.

This was my birthday trip and I did a lot of research before choosing a hotel because I wanted it to be a great experience for a decent price and I feel like I made a mistake staying here because of the horrible customer service. Where I come from, typically the customer is always right, and even when the customer is wrong, still treat them with respect and kindness because they are paying to stay at your hotel, when there are TONS of other places to choose from on the strip.

Location is great! Can't beat it. Mall pretty neat too. PH suffers from what they all do, the maze of the hotel\/casino\/mall. Maybe I am not good with directions but it took me 10-15 minutes just to get in or out of the building. And I get it, forces people to walk past more stores, and casino things. But doesn't make it less annoying.


Side note.. non smoking floor smells like smoke. And has ash trays on the hall. Even under the non smoking signs. Kind of annoying.

Check in: 30 minutes in line. You know what it's like to check in for your flight at the airport? Well, it's exactly the same here.

The room: One of the phones didn't work. The phone that worked was missing the faceplate template, so I had to guess on what the buttons were. Also, several of the lamp cords were unplugged. Super noisy . Heard the elevator going up and down constantly. 

Signage: Tiny, sparse, vague.

I called the font desk to ask a quick question. 30 minutes on hold.

Wake up call: That part was good. If you have a question when you're there, I suggest calling ""wake up call"" instead of the front desk. 

Meeting rooms: Big pillar that blocked out the line of sight for about 1\/3 or the room. 

Wifi: Ridiculous. $13 for EACH wifi device you connect to it. 

They must have a great sales department, because there's simply no reason this hotel should even still be in business being so poorly run and organized. 

Casino: I feel bad that they make the female card dealers wear such skimpy clothes. It's super cheesy and low class. Shame on you Planet Hollywood for appealing to the sleaziest common denominator. 

They also do a horrible job of promoting what's going in in the hotel...such as the shows, and restaurants they have there. and where things are located. Hard to believe they mess up such a simple thing as letting guests know what's going on in the hotel...guess then don't need the business. They won't be getting anymore of mine.

Funny part is our room was ""Hollywood Hipster"" themed and our room had NELL! You know, that movie with Jodie Foster and the secret creepy language? We had a display of a broom and a little shovel from the film.

clean our room.

When we got back to our room are tickets were gone. We tried everything to get them on our phones went to the box office no help because we got them from stub hub.

I advised front desk of what had happened told them I think housekeeping may have thrown them away. All they did was point me to their lobby computers to print new tickets but after paying for it their printers did not work. 

I complained to the manager and the manager said that she spoke with housekeeping and housekeeping did not throw any papers away. Finally we were able to get our tickets from stub hub on our phones and we saw 27 minutes of an hour and a half show which we spent over $1200 to watch.

Right after the show the manager told us they found our tickets which housekeeping did have. In fact she smiled at when while she showed me our tickets. When I asked them to compensate us for the loss of the show, for our rooms or for anything, they refuse to help us whatsoever. They were uncooperative, they were unhelpful, they were rude. I was told the only way they can help me is by filing a report.

I like the location of this resort, because its kind of in the center of the Las Vegas Strip.  

Check in was smooth, no problems there. Their promotion they had going on was what really won us over ((free booze each night we stayed)).  So of course, we were skeptical on how BIG the bottles would be, so to our surprise, they were actually a decent size...to be approximate, $40 bottle or so ((at least that's what it said on the receipt)).

I use to rave about this place, it was the ""go to"" hotel that was fun, nice, and reasonable. My husband booked this hotel cause it's centralized to everything and the shopping is so close. My issue with it is we booked a room for my daughter and her friends, they couldn't even accommodate her in a room closer to us, they were put in a room on the complete opposite side. My husbands friends had to switch out of their room cause the a\/c wasn't working. My husband was here on business a night before I arrived and he had to get switched out due to their wifi not working. We get into our room the walls have paint splotches, furniture completely beat up, rust all over the bathroom sink, shower....um you'd think this was a motel 6. Then I call for in room service, it's an hour and a half wait. Give me a break. Get with it Planet Hollywood, you need a revamp. 

Update: I waited for my husband to get back from his convention and decided to ask for a change of room. I realized the room did not have a full length mirror hence the paint splotches, looked as though it was ripped out and when I plugged my iPhone charger into the bathroom outlet the power went out. I spent 15 mins flipping the switch for it to come back on. We get to the front desk and the ""customer service"" rep tried to tell me that it happens in her apartment all the time....this is not an apartment this is a hotel for one, no comparison. Then she proceeds to say ""are you looking for an upgrade?"" I was pissed but found it quite entertaining. She was missing the point, I could care less for an upgrade, I wanted a proper room, that's all. Not the sh*t show they put us in and through. She calls her ""manager"" out, I believe her name is Desiree....who proceeds to tell my husband ""I switched you out yesterday because you complained about the wifi""...again for someone who is titled ""MANAGER"" she didn't get the point, she focused so hard on the fact that she already switched my husband out because of wifi issues in the room he stayed in the first night. While this whole time, the real point is, we booked 3 rooms, two of which were for 3 nights, the rooms online advertise full length mirror, complimentary wifi, etc etc...certainly didn't advertise a dump.

When I called the reservation line to book my stay I asked if they could make any special accommodations regarding my anniversary. The reservation line said that I would have to call the hotel front desk, which I did and they referred me back to the reservation line. So at that point I gave up and was already apprehensive in staying there. So here are some other factors that prompted such a low rating:

Check in - I requested an early check in (2:00) & when we arrived at the hotel and checked it at the front desk were told we had to wait till 4:00 because our room was still being cleaned. Off the bat, we are experiencing bad service.

Ice Machine - I took an ice chest with some  sodas & water and wanted to keep them cold. So I went to the nearest ice machine which was just down the hall and it wasn't working or just didn't have ice. I had to walk way across to the other side of the floor to get ice. I called maintenance and room service to get it fixed and was promised they would take care of the matter. Well guess what? It never got fixed even after calling 3 times and promised 3 times a Technician was being sent. I had to walk clear across the other side of the floor every time I needed to get ice and so did other annoyed visitors.

WiFi - I was promised free WiFi as part of the resort fee but every time I tried logging in none of my APs worked. After many attempts I finally called the front desk and was told to access the Internet and sign into the Hotel's WiFi by simply providing my email address, which I did. I then could see that the Hotel's WiFi would appear in my phone's WiFi setting but it never worked with any of my APs. So basically I had to use up my personal data all weekend because the Hotel's WiFi sucks.

Robbery - So there was also a robbery on our floor, one our neighbors left his room for a few minutes after the cleaning lady showed up & his room was robbed. They took his work laptop, back pack, & money. Sounds like an inside job!!

Room - I reserved the Vista Room which was about 585 in square feet with a nice King size bed and ample size restroom with a walk in bath.  The room's decor appeared outdated & used. The shower head and water pressure wasn't great and toilet kept plugging up. 

Room Service - normally in all hotels that I've stayed at have usually cleaned our rooms as long as you are gone and the don't disturb sign is removed. Not here! I had to call room service to have our room cleaned and get fresh towels. It was never done automatically which was totally annoying!! 

I also was awoke at 6:40am by house keeping stating that I had ordered a bed. It was me and my wife and we already had a king size bed so why would I have ordered a bed. The early morning knock scared the shit out of me since my neighbor was robbed the day before. Room Service never showed up during the day but came at 6:40am to bring a bed I didn't order! Go figure!!  

Overall, it wasn't a pleasant stay and I'm sure the hotel is more fitted for another type of demographic that doesn't care about details and too drunk to demand good customer service.

First, the miracle mile shops are downstairs and you can literally lose yourself for hours if you have nothin better to do. Second, the location is right in the middle of all the action. You can walk across to some of the other hotels, visit Walgreens, eat a Pink's hot dog, get a tattoo, all within a few blocks from this hotel. There is also Gordon Ramsey's restaurant downstairs and Britney Spears is performing here... Yes, there's also a club here. One more thing is that the standard rooms come with a deep soaking tub and the decor in each room has posters and props from Hollywood movies. No fridge or microwave though and my only gripe is that the gaming options are definitely overpriced so I would suggest taking a walk to one of the ""Cheaper"" casino's but I guess that's what this ""deluxe"" hotel can afford to do. Another grip is the Pleasure Pit. If I am going to gamble, I do not want to be distracted by these half naked women with their hoo-ha's hanging out dancing on tables near the gaming. If you're there for that type of attraction, go to a strip club or walk the strip, you will see plenty, lol. Other than that, 4 stars for location, glitz, convenience, glamor, etc.

Check-in takes so long that you have to wait in roped off, winding snake line (like at Disney World) just to give your name and get to your room. After a long day of travel that is the last thing I wanted. The front desk staff were also unhelpful-- I had to ask where the gym and the pool were, no one offered that information and the gym is hidden inside the spa (way back), and the pool is randomly on the 6th floor so you'd never find it alone. The lobby has hideous lighting that is constantly changing and made me feel sick while I waited. The room was huge but the space was all wasted-- there was no refrigerator so we threw tons of leftover food away during our stay (not what you want in a city known for food), the television was positioned so that you couldn't watch it from the bed without straining, the decor was hideous and my back hurt every morning when I woke up from the terribly uncomfortable beds. My husband's company booked the room for us but I'd never stay here again even if it was paid for-- the tackiest hotel in the tackiest mall on the tackiest part of the Vegas strip, it just doesn't get any worse than that. The wifi was apparently free but also really really bad-- not fast enough to stream a movie or do work from the room. 

The only reason I thought of giving the place two stars instead of one is because Koi (restaurant on premises) was delicious-- but all of the other food was mediocre at best. The pool also wasn't scenic or particularly clean-looking but the staff was super nice and attentive out there and it was really big so there was plenty of room for guests to relax by the pool without being on top of one another, which was nice but it was just such an ugly pool space. The one staff member working at the gym was nice as well and they gave out free water bottles and apples. The view from the room wasn't so hot so I hope no one paid with that in mind.

For $22, I was expecting a really nice view of the strip. We were disappointed at the TINY window and the ""strip view"" wasn't all that great either bc it was just a view from the side of the street but not directly on las vegas blvd. Then when we checked out and viewed the final bill, turns out they charged us $28 instead of the $22. So annoying.

Bathroom was also quite spacious, with a separate room with the toilet- which is perfect when you're cramming multiple people in one room.  Loved that we got a free bottle of booze when checking in.  The location is perfect I enjoyed the casino and the mall connected to it.

The pools were kind of lame.  We went out to the pools pretty early- like 9am and were able to secure a few spots, but any later than that you're pretty much SOL for having a spot near the pool.

Our group of appx 40 rooms were all booked on average for 4 days\/3 nights.

None of our group utilized the pool or parking so this review is just for the corporate booking\/rooms\/baggage\/casino.

Overall we were extremely pleased with PH. Corporate reservations were easy and there was quick follow up on rooming requests prior to our check in. When a few of our group had plane delays causing room cancellations the rooms were easily re-booked and that problem quickly solved. The front desk had no issues keeping our reservations straight and check-in was extremely quick for everyone. Since we mostly checked in on Wed and Thurs we avoided what I can assume would be the busy weekend times. 
My only complaint with check-in was the lack of benches in the lobby area. I realize that not having people congregating  in this area is ideal but it would be nice to have a place to wait for people. One bench just didn't cut it so adding more would be nice. 

The hotel rooms themselves are rather large and everyone said how comfortable the beds were which was great.  Some of our rooms were older than others but all were clean with huge bathrooms and varying degrees of views of Vegas. The higher up you went the better the view of course.  I don't think this was really all that important since we came to Vegas to do everything BUT spend time in our rooms. 
The shower had great water pressure and the bathtub was super deep.  Keep in mind the floor can be very slick so be sure to lay down floor mats\/towels in advance of bathing.  Common sense BUT you would be surprised!

The only issues with the rooms seemed to be that many of our lights were burnt out or so dim that they were useless. These were the ceiling lights upon entry into the rooms and not related to any lights that plugged in.  Also even though we had WiFi access it was extremely unreliable and many of us had trouble staying connected.  Not sure what the solution to this problem would be but considering we were there for a corporate function it was a tad frustrating.

Many of us spent time in the casino and at bars within the casino floor and all of us felt that the employees were extremely friendly and there was a wide array of games to keep us entertained. 
ATM fees are $6.99 (which I think is standard around Vegas casinos) so beware of this if you plan to take cash out.

The employees in the Starbucks were especially friendly and helpful.

The checkout process was super easy and leaving\/retrieving  our bags with the baggage desk was a really fluid process. 

Finally everyone used Uber and having a designated pick-up and drop off location made the process so easy for us all.

We made the reservations 1 week in advance. The shows are wonderful we saw Britney Spears and Paul Zerdin both absolutely entertaining and fun. However, the actual resort was a complete disappointment. First, we had a room overlooking the pool area, don't recommend, and were subjected to deep base sounds pulsating until 8 or 9. At 2 in the morning after our evening was completed we laid down to sleep and this continuous noise and rumbling echoed throughout our room...we had no idea what that could have been until it dawned on me how close to the elevators our room was. It was the elevators...non-stop, up and down all night long. We were unable to sleep very well. In addition, the room was a bit disappointing and sink was not working properly. The casino also was not as good as some others nearby and if you gamble at the bar they still charge you for the drinks...none of the other casinos did that. So my advise is to see shows here but stay elsewhere...or at least away from pool and elevator banks.",0,0,0

You have everything you need to make a one-of-a-kind ""Vegas Baby"" experience. The two or one star players don't know how to party so let me help you. Maybe then you will rethink such a low ranking for one of the best spots in town. 

Here is my typical night out at PH:(Warning: it isn't for everyone and I do not endorse this behavior. Please do this at your own risk. This what I do and you have to be 21)

1. Start your night with a Fat Tuesday in the Miracle Mile shoppes (who cares if you have to walk a 100 yards from the garage; it's good for you) 

2. Then work your way  to the Casino and pick your poison (Slots, Video poker, Black Jack, Three Card Poker, Let It Ride, Craps you name it they have it) My all time favorite is QUACK SHOT! Ask a floor manager to help you find it. Put 20 bucks in and have fun. We hit the jackpot quiet a few times over the years.  

3. Go back and get another Fat Tuesday. ""I DO"" (180 octane with extra shot)

4. Now work you way over to the ""Pleasure Pit"" (really it is the pleasure pit) with hot girls dancing on the poles while you play black jack. ""One and Two Stars Guys Really""???""Five Stars in my book all the way baby""!!!! It's Vegas Baby not Kansas Dorthy! 

5. Now you are ready to hit the night club. check-in at the base of the club next to the pleasure pit and ride your way up to heaven (really you will be going above the casino to the second floor via escalator) . This spot is kicking around 1:00am. Have fun! By now the Fat Tuesdays have kicked-In so don't push it (drinking) or you will be sorry. At least that's what happens to me. 

6. It will be around 4:00am when you get done with the club and you will be hungry and ready to eat; but don't worry it is time to go to your last spot.  

7. come down from the club and back to reality; head to the right and visit Earls' Sandwich. This will hit the spot ""Trust Me On This"" 

8. Now that your belly is full and you can think again it is time to hit the Poker Room. The chips will be loose at this time of night.  If you are an experienced poker pro like myself then you will feel you have stepped into a shooting gallery. For some of you it is good night from here and time to take a cab home. Please do not drink and drive in Las Vegas (our families are on the roads; remember that). You can pickup your car later in the day. 

That is my  true 'Vegas Baby Night"" Night Out!",8,5,7

We came here for my fiance's birthday. Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino is a super trendy and fun place, however, we did have issues with our room. I specifically booked a non-smoking room but for some odd reason, there was still a really consistent cigarette smell in the bathroom coming from the vents. I reported this issue twice and no one seemed to have an answer or care to come check out the problem so that was a red flag for me. There was also a leak in our room (room #861) when we used the bathtub. The room we booked was supposed to be ""newly renovated"" but it didn't really seem like it. The frame of the bed and the furniture was extremely dusty and although the house keepers did come in to ""clean"" our room, they did a very sloppy job at it. 

Outside of the room, I do love that Planet Hollywood doesn't have as bad of a cigarette smell as other hotel and casinos on the strip. I also love the entertainment that they have (i.e. JLO's show was fantastic!). 

Overall,
It is a fun hotel and casino but I would have to think about if I want to stay here again. The room was cool but not as amazing as I thought it would be and the cigarette smell was really frustrating and kind of put a damper on our room experience.

I hope this review helps you decide on where to stay during your Viva Las Vegas adventures! :)",2,1,0

Let's start at the beginning. Showed up around 9pm on a Thursday. I know it is a busy night for hotels because I do what many people do: come on Thursday evening and take Friday off, to squeeze an extra night of fun out of a Vegas stay. So the line was understandably large. But it wasn't large enough that we should have spent 45 minutes waiting. There were only 4 receptionists trying to work through a line that was 30 or so people deep.

When we finally cleared the line, we were told that we would not be able to get two adjacent double-queen rooms, let alone adjoining. I told the guy working on us that we would be fine with rooms that were close to each other on the same floor as well. He couldn't find any of those either, and came up with a solution: he would upgrade us for free to two adjoining rooms with a strip view (which we normally wouldn't have access to based on what we paid for), however one of these rooms would have a king bed and the other would have the two queens we asked for.  The receptionist assured us that we would be able to request a rollaway build at no charge. I was honestly satisfied with this outcome, but it gets better:

- We could only put our stuff in one room because the adjoining room was not cleaned yet. The room would be ready later in the evening.
- When we dialed for the rollaway, we were brusquely told that this would cost an extra $30 per night (!!!) Clearly a case of the foot not knowing what the head is doing, but still. We eventually got it cleared up, but not without going back down to the reception to yell at people.
- The bathroom in the king-room had two faucets, but one of these only dispensed hot water. Repeated requests to get this fixed were never fulfilled.

Overall we felt that for the amount we had paid for the privilege to stay at PH was high enough that this level of service should have been much higher than it was. Next time I go to Vegas I definitely won't stay at PH... I did have a much better experience with the Venetian in 2009. Heck, Circus Circus might've been a better experience. Sigh.",2,0,0

I went for a work trip and you can't imagine the thrill I had knowing we were staying in the same hotel that Britney is preforming at (the teenage girl in me is still star struck) but honestly, I've never had a worse experience in Vegas. The first day our room wasn't even ready when we arrived, by the third day our room hadn't been cleaned once, and the fourth day our neighbors took it upon themselves to hotbox their hotel room which led to the vent pumping their smoke into our room. At first the hotel did NOTHING about our neighbors and told us that this was impossible. Finally after much pestering they sent a secutriy guard up who immediately confirmed our suspicion and told the front desk to move us.

Cons: The elevators are so slow! I have no idea why, but while we were there, only two elevators were working at a time.

This year (Christmas 09) I decided to get out of Chicago's cold weather, and on out to Vegas.  I've stayed at most of the hotels in the city, including Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Hard Rock, Excalibur, Four Seasons and even Rio.  I found a good price on the internet to stay at Planet Hollywood, and decided to give it a shot.  All an all, I probably won't be making a trip back to PH again.  

Good Points:
Planet Hollywood is located right on the strip, across the street from the top shelf, ultra swanky Aria hotel. PH has plenty of slot machines, and more than enough restaurants and bars to have a good time. Planet Hollywood's decor is something a kin to a dance club, with endless neon, flashing lights through out the lobby.  If you're into a club like atmosphere, might be right in your wheel house. The sounds of high energy dance music, and classic rock run rampid through the casino's sound system.  Also PH is connected to a huge mall called the magnificent mile, where visitors can shop at high end stores and people watch.  I was also impressed with their Planet Dallies Cafe. The cafe serves up (somwhat reasonablly) priced food. 
Finally, PH is close to other tourist attractions on the strip-meaning all of the other hotels.  

Negative:
The rooms at Planet Hollywood are not that nice at all.  The hotel will and does try to charge you for every little thing. For example, a view of the strip will cost $50.00 a night extra, depending on your room. If you decide to order room service, please ask before purchasing your order. A $16.00 breakfast turned into a nearly $30.00 meal, after the hotel threw on a take out tax, cover charge tax as well as city tax.  This also goes for the spa at PH.  We paid for a massage (male massage therapist for sports massage) and a manicure for my girl. The price was about $250.00. Not bad.  However; after the spa service was over, they hit us a gratuity fee of 20%. Of course, this was totally wrong since we had already tiped or massage therapist and nail tech cash right after service.  The rooms are also small (unless you are paying for an upgrade).  Room service came to clean late in the day, and did not do a very good job.  

Overall, while the hotel was certainly a site to see, it did not meet up to my standards for a relaxing experience.  PH might also invest in getting larger signs to show guests where all of its attactions are.  My best advice is to stay at a place like Mandalay Bay, and spend a little more to stay at THE HOTEL.  The rooms, service, and over all expeirence is a lot better.  

If you can find another hotel in Vegas at a better or equal rate, I would not suggest staying at Planet Hollywood. 

The staff at the hotel is not friendly, and gave us the impression that we were bothering them.",5,0,0

The good stuff: 
-  Great location!  Center Strip and attached to the Miracle Mile shops
-  Great value for the room price - couldn't beat the price for this nice Hotel
-  Cool \/ Hip Hotel, nice rooms, liked the feel of the casino

The not so good minor stuff.....
- might seem an odd thing to say, but the window in the room seemed way too small!  I have stayed at 15+ Vegas hotels and remember most to have full wall windows (ex: Mandalay) or really large windows.  I enjoy looking out at the strip and it seemed strange to have this small window?  
- the pools are too small - like really small for Vegas.  Tried unsuccessfully 3 different days to grab a poolside lounge chair and it wasn't happening.   There is a huge sun deck area between the pools, but you really lose the ""poolside"" atmosphere.  I know that the pool scene is a big thing in Vegas these days and PH misses the mark here.
- Valet was a bit of a hassle and seemed understaffed most of the time we were there.  The guys were great, just not enough of them.  Just a minor issue.

But that wasn't what I got.

I walked into the room (which was the lowest price range) and was incredibly unhappy. The room was SMALL. The bathroom looked like a wreck and it just felt icky in there. So I called the front desk asking if I could upgrade to the next price range up (which was an extra $20\/night, that sounded pretty reasonable).

Extra star for letting us check in 3 hours early and for being super super accommodating with letting us switch rooms.

I don't remember what the second one up is, I wish I did so it could probably help those of you looking at this review but the room was significantly bigger and the bathroom arrangement was MUCH better. It had the tub in the middle, the shower on the right and the toilet on the left as well as two bathroom sinks.

The second night in, I called housekeeping for more towels. After waiting about 45 minutes with nothing, my husband called again and someone was promptly at our door within 10 minutes with not only new towels, but WARM new towels! Not really sure what happened that first time around. 

The Mile Shops are okay. The fact that Earl of Sandwich is open 24 hours is a nice plus. My only other complaint is that it was hard to find the room elevators in the casino.

Judging by other reviews on here, it seems like your stay will be fantastic if you pick the right room price level. I'd probably give this resort another go. The stay wasn't awful and the beds were nice to sink into after a long day of walking.",0,0,0

So biggest thing to make this place not worth the land it is built on is that they  first, GAVE ALL MY INFO AND MY ROOM BILLING INFO for both of the rooms that I had booked under my name only to another person. This in turn caused huge issues in our group, we actually had a huge blow up in the lobby due to this. Second, they allowed another person in our group to go and check into a room that I was told was not ready to be checked into WITHOUT ME BEING PRESENT and WITHOUT ME EVEN BEING AT THE PROPRTY. Now I don't think I am an expert on privacy laws or occupancy and identification requirements, but I believe that this is something that is illegal or against the law, not to mention I would also think this would be against hotel policy. I am actually getting legal counseling for this and am looking into what I can do about a situation like this. ANYONE OUT THERE CONTACT me if you have any info you can share.

Let's get to the hotel. Bathroom doors were broken, out of the 3 rooms we had 1 had a fridge, power plug to the desktop computer area didn't work(which is not a big deal just have to mention it all), and how in the world can you have a hotel now a days that doesn't have an ipod hook up(either to the tv or clock radio) to play music. Also we asked for 2 glasses to the room to use for drinks and they charged me $10 to use an extra pair of glasses. This the first time I have ever had a hotel charge me to use some of their glasses. I could have gone and played cheap slots and ordered free drinks that would come with a glass. 

Now to the pool. When I walked out to the pool it was nice to see all the space that it had. But then I kept walking looking for some pools to go into. And kept looking and low and behold finally found their pools. When I saw how small and horribly bad these pools were I thought I would kill myself. But after looking at how packed and disgusting the water was in the pool I figured if I want to do that I might as well get in because that disease filled pool could do it for me. This is definitely one of the, if not the worst pool I have ever seen.

I realize checking in late means that the hotel staff probably won't be able to make your requests happen. They weren't able to get us joining rooms, or two rooms even on the same floor. It wasn't a sold out weekend, either. We had to call the next day after check out and request that one of our rooms be moved. They couldn't get a room next to either one of our rooms. We both had to move rooms to a different floor in order to get joining rooms. What a pain in the butt! Their food at their cafe was delicious. Their portions were large and the wait staff was very friendly. The rooms were decent. It's hard to complain when one of the rooms is free. They only have one small window in each room. Don't stay m for the view. Their water took forever to get hot and was barely luke warm at best. Overrall the stay was nice but I wouldn't pay over $200.00 a night for their rooms.

Shopping - countless number of shops - only shopped for an hour or so, but they have everything from clothing stores to electronic stores to souvenir shops.

My one major disappointed is the parking situation. The valet for the hotel is always full so you end up parking in the Miracle Mile mall parking lot. The entrance to the hotel from the mall parking lot entrance is 1\/2 a mile! So basically you go through half the mall.

Room was clean, modern and spacious. The location of the TV (in proximity to the chairs and bed) was a bit odd, but we only watched TV to check in on the a.m. news (oh look...another warm, sunny day in Vegas). 

Location is good for walking around, although we did Uber quite a bit as casino blocks are not like neighborhood blocks and the best shoes in the world won't save your feet after a long day of walking around. Played a few penny slots and did okay, but I'm talking about penny slots here...so my $14 payout on my $1 play isn't exactly covering our expenses.

Located next to a strip of shops, we did visit the ABC store to stock up a couple of essentials. The Starbucks in the hotel and Earl of Sandwich in the casino is a life saver for when your time-clock is all a-mess from the sensory overload for which Vegas is known.

We got there around 11ish, so there was barely a line at check in and I was crossing my fingers that our room was ready. We were greeted by a young man who was super nice and gave us a ""high level"" room simply cus we asked..LOL. and the room was ready!

We got into the room, and we were shocked at how nice it was. Ive stayed at 5 star\/diamond hotels before at vegas and I thought this was going to be a downgrade..but it met my expectations. 
The decor is modern with deep purples, black, and velvet. The bed was super comfy and I fell in love with the pillows. 
The bathroom was huuuge! If you have ever stayed at the Venetian or the Palazzo, it is the same idea and size. There is a shower and a seperate deep sunken bathtub, for two or three! But I turned it into a makeshift fridge (alot of ice) and alchy bottles. The cleaning ladies didnt mind at all! 
Plus we had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain\/water show and Paris' Eifel Tower!
Ohh..BTW the rooms are themed after movies..we got the Robin Hood theme, thank god we didnt get the Exorcist room..lol
The only con about the room is that we had to call security to fix our in-room safe and the armoir door literally fell on my foot!!!

The casino looks huge, but its a mind trick..lol. The casino is built in a circle..so it looks like there is alot of table games and slots. If you want a lil spice with ur table games go to the ""Pleasure Pit"", a few girls dancing in the middle with poles. Kind of a knock off the PussyCat Dolls Lounge at Ceasars Palace outside of Pure. Didnt play much here, not much action and the casino is kinda dead..rather hit up the Bellagio across the street or the Venetian for more fun in the casino.

Cleanliness of the room was superb and shot down all negative pictures and paranoia of stained sheets and mildew in strange areas. The casino had such a young hip feel to all of it that it didn't seem too outrageously fancy and just made me feel comfortable. The Britney Spears elevators had my fiancé taking selfies left and right and partying to the music in them up to the room.

The next day we waited for housekeeping to come in, and they never did. At 8:00 at night I had to call in and ask for someone to come clean our room. 
The tv was hot, the wifi as promised online didn't come through\/false advertisement, you actually have to pay for it. 
I spent most of my time calling housekeeping while in the room.

We were there to see ""All I have"" by J.lo, Amazing show btw.  So, my partner thought it would be a good idea to stay at the same hotel that the show would be so that we could drink and not have to worry about getting to the venue and so forth.  We have never stayed at this hotel so it seemed like a good idea.  Well, when we got to our room on the 17th floor, the first thing we noticed immediately getting off the elevator, was that the lobby area ""not registration"" but when you exit the elevator on your floor to go into the hall ways towards your room, there was no air conditioning, mind you the temperature this weekend was 115 degrees when we arrived and humid, which I have never experienced before in Vegas, but anyway, the lobby\/hall way were at least 85 degrees inside the hotel.  Once we made it to our room, as I open the door the first thing to hit me is the smell of Pine sol\/slash bathroom if you can imagine that smell. The rooms were pretty roomy and actually very large, the bathroom was huge (Plus) but that was about it.  The air was at Max and the room felt like it was barely at 75 degrees, there was no mini fridge, we quickly found out that we could rent one for $20\/day! No thanks.  So we take a chill and decide to nap and then shower to hit the town.  It took literally like 5 minutes for warm water to come out the shower. We called it in and the response we got was, ""this is normal is high rise hotels""  What?  Really?  UUHhhmm, I have stayed at multiple hotels on the strip on floors higher than the 17th floor, and that has never happened.  Being a CA resident and knowing that we are in an extreme drought, wasting so much water just to take a shower hurt.  So then we head down to the pool and we find out that in order to enjoy ourselves near the small pool, that was overcrowded, cloudy water, that they have for a 23 floor mega hotel, we have to rent the chairs at $20\/ person per day.  The towels were free though.  The hotel is run down, the elevators have no air ventilation inside either, they took forever, the hallways are dirty and fixtures falling apart.  No premium channels and the tv is like 10 years old.  The Wi-Fi was free but it sucked major balls, I had no reception the entire weekend, and if you wanted an upgrade, you guessed it, $9.99 for two devices per day. The last and quite possibly the most disgusting thing I experienced and unfortunately did not see until the last day, was that my white sheets had blood stains on them.  Never again, for the price that we paid, we could have stayed at The Mandalay Bay which we have stayed before and it has been awesome.  I can't believe that this hotel is part of Caesar's Palace.  Never again!!  I guess all their money is going into paying Britney and J.lo that they have forgotten about the property.

The hotel is connected to the Miracle Mile shops which is convenient and I like that the hotel is pretty central on the strip.  I am an asthmatic and the smoke seems so much worse here than other hotels\/casinos.  Bring your eye drops.  PH should invest in some sort of ventilation system.  The decor seems outdated. The carpets in the halls need stretched and the rooms' bathrooms redone. The bathrooms are large with a tub, but who uses a tub in a hotel anyway.  I would rather a double sink or vanity area to make getting ready easier.  Also there is no closet only a small armoire.  I thought the room was good.  It was clean and the beds comfortable.  It has the perfect amount of amenities since you spend almost no time in there. I wish the rooms' windows were larger and more centered on the wall so you can see the view.  The pool is pretty private (on the 6th floor) and I like that they have two separate pool areas; one is 21+ and the other a family pool. The adult pool has a DJ most days of the week but it's still a far cry from the other party pools. This is more of a pool to relax. I was shocked that for such a lack luster experience you have to pay so much for beds\/cabanas at the pool.  They were running a spa deal for $99 if you choose at least $200 in services. With this you also get to spend the day using the other spa amenties (gym, hot tub, showers, steam room and sauna).  The deal seemed good but after my facial I only stayed an hour because I ran out of things to do.  What they should do is get rid of Koi (Its so bad they give out free open bar all night every night to everyone- males included)  and revamp the spa area.  It is outdated.  Although I haven't been, I heard Aria has great spa amenities such hot stone beds, a pool, etc. and the things I mentioned above.  The gym at PH costs $25 a day and I'm not sure why.  It has less equipment than a Holiday Inn.",0,0,1

Here is why I gave it only 1 star:

PROS:
1)  The Miracle Mile mall - it's great to have this in the hotel when you need a last minute shopping trip before you go out for the evening.
2)  The Dailies Coffee Shop - HUGE menu with pretty delicious food!
3)  Starbucks - inside the hotel!  Need I say more?
4)  Bell staff - Our room wasn't ready at the check-in time (even though we had registered with the front desk in the early AM, so we checked-in our luggage with the bell staff so we could go to the spa, and lay by the pool.  We had gone in\/out of the checked-luggage area multiple times throughout the day, and they were always so nice and accommodating.  

CONS:
1)  We checked in at the front desk at 8:30am, even though check-in was at 3pm.  But at check-in time, our room still wasn't ready!
2)  The door on the armoire was falling off the hinge and almost fell on my friend when we tried to use it!  
3)  NO hair dryer in the room!!!  - even Holiday Inn has one!!  WTH!
4)  We asked for additional towels, and no one showed up.
5)  We were at this hotel for 2 nights\/3 days, and no one came to clean our room!
6)  The pool here is HORRIBLE!  It's 2 small rectangular pools on either side of a HUGE cemented patio.  There isn't much space poolside to hold many people so the lounge chairs are side to side and you have to climb in from the end of the lounge chair to get in!  The only area with a lot more lounge chairs is the cemented area which is extremely hot, no umbrellas, trees, or even misters!  Good luck frying in there!  AND, don't even think of getting a cabana here.  Yes, it's reasonable at $500, on the weekends, but it's nothing more than a portable tent with ratty day beds underneath.  The pool waitresses are not the ones you would expect at a big hotel during the summer: ugly bathing suits, sandals that look like they came from Goodwill, and some should be wearing more clothing than swimsuits.  Also, no one kept the lounging areas clean.  We arrived at about 2pm at the pools, and there were empty plates laying on the floor, behind, and on top of empty lounge chairs.  No one collected towels from lounge chairs that people had vacated, so it looked like a tornado.  Gross!
7)  There are no signs or directories - We had to ask multiple people (who all told us varying directions) where to find the pool (located on the 6th floor of the South Elevators), the Spa (on the Mezzanine level), the concert area (you have to go into the mall)
8)  The website SUCKS!  Bad layout, barely any pictures of the pool, you have to type in the name of the Spa in a internet search engine to find their website!  You can't navigate into the spa website from the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino website.  


If you have to stay around this particular location on the strip, here are your ALTERNATIVES:
1)  The Towers at Planet Hollywood - nicer rooms, nicer staff, much much nicer pool, nicer everything!
2)  Paris - cozy rooms
3)  Bally's - big rooms
4)  Caeser's Palace - a classic
5) The Cosmopolitan - because it's new
6) Aria - just beautiful
7) Bellagio - same as #6",4,0,0

Planet Hollywood might not be the biggest, most well known, or fanciest, but it's definitely one of the best bang for the buck. They are located in the center of the strip across from the famous Bellagio Hotel, You'll have easy access to explore the other hotels and attractions on the strip. There is a liquor store at the Miracle Mile (ABC Store), with reasonable prices. I always find this place 50-80 dollars cheaper per night compared to rest of the big name hotels in Vegas and the rooms are very clean. The Go-Go dancers make the Pleasure Pit a fun place to gamble and buffet (Spice Market) downstairs is fantastic. If you show your loyalty, Planet Hollywood will welcome you back with free complimentary night stays. I've been offered those vouchers a couple times already, even though I'm not a big gambler. They were recently acquired by Harrah's from Starwood, so I might write follow-up review on the new management. 

A little about my credentials:

My baby face makes it difficult for me to walk around Vegas, but go there about 4-5 times a year. I've stayed at various hotels, but recently decided to stick with Planet Hollywood.

I have to say that this stay was just ok.  Our bed was, for the first time, horribly uncomfortable.  25th floor --overlooking the pools and across from Cosmopolitan.  The band at Cosmopolitan plays till midnight on the weekend--and plays very loud!!  OMG loud!  We could actually feel the room vibrating with the music.  5 STARS for housekeeping!!  We rent a car while we are in Vegas--the drawback for us is parking in the garage at Planet, and getting through the mall to get to the casino to get to the elevators.  a good 20-25 minutes (ok, we are in our 50's, so maybe we are slower).  Breakfast at the Buffet is good--make sure to go to the Destinations website to print out $5 discount coupon for the buffet--and make copies, too--it's good anytime.
Our room was Hollywood Hip--it was not a brightly lit room, by any means--bathroom is poorly lit, as well.  But I do like that the shower is separate from the tub.  
Be aware that when you book and pay for your room ahead of time, that you will be charged upon check in $27 per night for the resort fee--very high considering the wifi is only workable via phone line connection (which my tablet doesn't have).  I don't use it anyway while I'm on vacation--but that's a pretty steep resort fee...especially if you aren't planning on using any of the spa, pool or internet offerings.  
During the day, the music in the casino is classic rock--its a great atmosphere--then the head banging music rolls on for the evening.  And it's piped in very loud--yes, again with the loud music.

Stay dates: April 19-21, 2013

After sitting in traffic out front on the strip for about 12-15 minutes, we circled the block looking for the parking entrance. We discovered it is actually on Harmon. We saw no signs on the strip directing us to where the entrance is. Arrival and check in were smooth enough. Valet was quick and friendly, as was the front desk. I was happy to see a designated check in line for Total Rewards Platinum players and above. No upgrades were available, so we were only able to get our reserved ""Resort Room"". So far, so good.

Upon arrival in our room, I notice a large foyer, void of any type of furnishing other than a large mirror on the wall. They tout these Resort Rooms have additional space, but what good is additional space when you do nothing with it? Not really a complaint, just an observation. To my right is the large bathroom, dual sinks, oversized tub, and separate water closet, all as advertised. The main room seemed underwhelming. A typical desk, a 2 chair seating area with memorabilia table, and an entertainment center\/closet\/dresser. Closet and drawer space is in short supply. 2 drawers and probably 7-10 hangers in the closet. Kind of odd for a ""Resort"" room. Don't most people stay in a resort for nearly a week? Where would they put their clothes? The bed was a little on the firm side, but not bad. Room was quiet, with minimal disturbances in the hall.

After the 4 hour drive, I flop in the purple oversized chair in the sitting area, and am shocked how uncomfortable it is. Sinks way too low, no back support. It's almost as if the cushions are missing. Probably the worst room chair ever. I head to the bathroom to wash up and get ready for the night ahead. While washing my hands, the sink starts to back up almost instantly. The drain was very slow. How does this happen? Housekeeping doesn't notice while cleaning the sink? Or do they not give a shit? I am going with the latter, because when I turned off the water I noticed a long blonde hair wrapped around the handle.

We head down to the casino. First stop: Yolo's. Decent tacos with the casino floor price tag. $15 gets you 3, $16 gets you a build your own margarita. You probably can't get out of here for les than $100 for 2 if you have drinks, $60 if you don't. Service, drinks, and food quality are good, no complaints here, really. I actually liked Yolo's.

The casino has a good selection of slots, and many $5 minimum tables. Dealers and pit staff were good and friendly. Cleanliness was sorely lacking in the slot areas. Many full ashtrays, empty beer bottles and cocktail glasses. Again, was happy to see a special line for Total Rewards Platinum level players and above for the casino cage. A feature that seems to be dying out across Caesars properties, usually reserved for Diamond and Seven Stars players.

Saturday morning we prep to head out to do a couple things around town. Shower water pressure is weak, but water temp is consistent. Towels and amenities are fine. We have 2 sinks, but can only use 1 due to the slow drain on the other. We head out and board our elevator to find more common area filth. An egg mcmuffin wrapper on the floor and an obvious orange juice spill, which was there long enough to be almost dry and sticky. Are any of the cleaning staff paying attention here? Probably not, because when we came back later in the day we wait to board our elevator and again, filthy common areas. As a matter of fact, a pair of men's boxer briefs were laying on the floor in the north tower elevator lobby. Really? Underwear? On the floor in a common area? What an absolute disgrace. This is the point where my opinion of PH finally goes from ""not bad"" to ""what a dump"".

We had a long Saturday night in the casino, and Sunday morning was unforgiving. We opted for room service for breakfast. Another huge disappointment. I had a chicken hash and eggs that was totally disgusting. The chicken seemed like leftovers that were microwaved and dried out, tossed together with frozen fried ""breakfast potatoes"" and topped with 3 eggs. I should have gotten an omelet, but the menu description for this item was pretty appetizing. The reality, not so much.

I was really looking forward to a stay at PH, but was sadly met with disappointment at every single turn. The positives were far outnumbered by the negatives, and I will not be returning. My advice would be to stay away, there are much better options in Las Vegas.",6,3,3

 I have never received such horrible service from any casino. I sat down at a table and gave the dealer my TR card, i am a platinum member, along with my hundred dollar buy in. Nobody ever came to check me in! It wasn't until I was done playing that I had to stop one of the pit bosses and ask to be checked in. He looked at my card, gave it back to me, and said ""yeah we will get ya"" and walked off! 

The dealer was so bad at dealing I think she should have stayed a stripper! I was pretty tipsy, but I had to tell her every time I won! Not some of the times, EVERY TIME!! She would pick up my chips and I would have to say, wait! I won that hand. So I guess you not only lose money gambling but you also have to work for them training their dealers. I have had dealers make mistakes, but she was taking it to a whole new level. The worst part about it is that she started being rude to me! Rolling her eyes when I would call her out, and at one point she started making fun of me because I was losing! 

I then walked over to one of the head pit bosses to express my frustration. She said ""what do you want me to do about it"" and started laughing at me along with a few guys at a near by table. I was furious by this time, and went down to the front desk to speak to the hotel manager. I left two messages, and maybe she is still assisting other guests because I have yet to talk to anyone. 

If I wanted to be ridiculed I could find cheaper ways of doing it, this place is the worst!",5,1,0

I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights.  The hotel was not very good.  They gave us a room with a broken blind.   Because I need the room to be dark to sleep, I asked them for another room since it needed to be fixed, but, the front desk refused.  They told me it was fixable.  I had to wait an hour for the guy to show up.  He stayed about an hour to fix the blinds. 

The shower drain was backed up.  Every time I used the shower, the water would back up.  The puddle in the shower was about an inch deep.  Who knows what kind of germs came out of there when it overflowed.  

The housekeepers did not clean up our room too well after the clubbers checked out.  They left one club wristbands stuck to the glass displaying Steven Baldwin's shirt.   They left another one on the nightstand.  Yes, I was lucky enough to get a room honoring Steven Baldwin.  

Don't think about swimming laps in the pool.  I tried, until the fat guy decided to stand right where I was swimming.  When I moved over to avoid him, there were little Asian girls that were in my way.  The lifeguard told me that I could swim my laps in the ""Adult"" pool.   I wasn't sure if the ""Adult"" pool  meant that there would be hot women all around while I was trying to swim, or if there would be naked people in that pool.  I didn't want to find out.  Naked people and hot women would definitely be too distracting for me since I was attempting to swim laps.  Exercise is useless when on vacation.  I don't know why I tried to swim there.   I did get about 10 minutes of swimming in.  

Yes, I was cheap.  I chose to self park.  I got news for you that want to be cheap.  The miracle mile shops?  I decided to ask the obvious question to the customer service people.  I asked them ""Is the miracle mile really a mile?""   The answer I got was ""No, it is a little bit over a mile.""   Don't be like me and leave your car keys in the hotel room if you are going to the self parking lot for your car.   If you are dumb like me, and realize that you forgot the keys after you arrive at the parking structure, then you will end up walking more than 1 1\/2 miles just to fetch your keys.  A one way trip from the parking structure to the hotel\/casino is a little over 1\/2 a mile.

The room was spacious, the hotel was centrally located, and it was decent for 5 girls.

Okay, so I'll get on with the breakdown about Planet Hollywood...

There are older cheaper hotels on the strip with better (updated) rooms and conditions. We stayed here at the recommendation of someone who'd stayed there previously and said that it was solid. While the hotel itself was beautiful, I did not feel that the rooms were very nice. They were a little old and outdated. They were also quite dark. Each room features props from various movie sets, as a part of the running theme. I thought this was cool, but chances are that you'll be in a room with props from a movie you've never seen with some ""C list"" 1980's or 90's actor you've never heard of before. As for amenities, there are no coffee pots, fridges or microwaves in the rooms. There goes the opportunity to save leftovers for the week. The best thing about Planet Hollywood is that it is attached to Miracle Mile mall and has a ton of eating and shopping places nearby. The next time we are in Vegas we will probably stay at The Linq or somewhere near the Linq promenade because we always spend a significant amount of time hanging out there.",1,1,2

Pros: Great, central location. Decent amount of food options in the hotel, pleasure pit, and 

Cons: No one cleaned our room the whole 3 day stay--our bed was remade and we had new towels but it was obvious no one vaccummed or cleaned the bathroom. There were dusty socks and a shoe that had obviously been under the bed for more than a few weeks, no refrigerator (unless you wanted to rent one), and an extremely disfunctional system of transferring calls. Trying to get dry cleaning took 4 connections and trying to get a status update on the dry cleaning took 5 transfers. We ordered PF Changs to the room and the lady who answered was extremely rude, my other hotel phone line was ringing loudly and she yelled at me that it was hurting her ears (it was hurting mine too but I dont know how to turn the hotel phone down and have no idea why it would ring in the first place if I was on the other line).

The rooms have a crazy weird layout.. a standard double queen room have the beds facing the tv.. that makes sense. Upgrade to a double queen suite for more space and a bigger bathroom and you have the two beds face the window that overlooks the pool\/strip.. and the tv is off to the side. Ok so who cares about tv when you're in vegas, right? But still, it's a dumb floorplan. Not to mention, the tv unit is also the closet\/dresser drawer unit. wth? LOL. okaaay. I would imagine the closet area should be near the bathroom, but whatever. 

wifi and internet is $20 a day. toiletries are generic crap. 

the miracle mile shops that are attached to the hotel are crap stores that you can find in any low end mall. fitting as the high end mall is across the street at Crystals anyway.

My initial thoughts were that this was going to be great. We arrived very early (7am) so we can begin our fun in Vegas. When I reserved the room they allowed me to check a box to get early check in as early as 9am. I checked it hoping I can get it but we didn't. No big deal though, I received an email not too long after 9am to check in online so they will email me when my room is ready. We waited all day long and never received an email. 4pm came along so I go to check in and it was no issue. Why wasn't I notified via email if my room was ready? The Front desk clerk had no idea and decided he wasn't going to try to find an answer or didn't care, either way I didn't feel like I was a VIP guest.

So...we checked in...I got a Resort Room with the strip view. This was the first time I stayed on the strip of Las Vegas and was excited to see all the lights and happenings of the strip through our ""Strip View"" window. They gave us room #669, bottom floor level and the room was disgusting. Our view was of a bunch of plastic umbrella stands stacked up against a wall, temporary metal gates, and 4' tall bushes blocking the ""Strip View"" we thought we would have. Beyond that, the bed skirts looked as if they have not been cleaned in some time. I can exaggerate a bit, but I will keep it clean.

The hotel lobby is below the casino floor level and actually kind of far from the parking lot.  We arrived before check-in, which is at 3 p.m., so we did a pre-check in.  At 3 p.m., all we had to do was pick up the keys.  I would definitely recommend this if you can arrive a little bit earlier, because the line to check-in at 3 p.m. was really long.  

The hotel room was pretty average, nothing too fancy.  The pillows don't seem as plush as many of the other hotel's that I stayed at.  The bathroom is pretty large and has a tub (but I never really care for bathtubs at hotels, it just seems a bit yucky).  Instead of a large bathroom, I would have preferred the room itself be a bit bigger or have a couch.  

The pool area (sixth floor) was pretty boring compared to other pools in Vegas.  It's mainly a concrete covered roof area with lawn chairs.  There are two pools.  One pool had really loud music blasting and it was considered 21+.  The other pool was the ""family pool"" and was a bit calmer.  The pool isn't really big enough to swim much, most people are just standing there, drinking Budweiser.  Not an amazing pool, but it works.  

Overall, the hotel is pretty average.  It's clean and nice enough; the greatest thing about it is that it's central location, right in the middle of the strip.  At the price of free, I can't really complain.

It seems like the two rooms behind the double doors might have once been one mega-suite and they bastardized it down into 2 separate rooms.

Close walk to Paris, Caesars, the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio. 

The room was mediocre...at best. So small, terrible lighting...like terrible, we had to change our room once because the bed was horrendous and all though it is non-smoking it stunk of smoke. The carpets were bunched and there were limited electrical outlets. It was a very small room, pretty much a bed, huge wall unit with two closets and the TV hanging in it, a small chair and desk.....without a chair. The furniture was literally on top of each other. Ironically the bathroom was 3\/4 of the size of the bedroom\/sleeping space. It was clean but dated with tiny white tiles. If they give you a room next to the elevator, say no....it's literally like a train is running through the room 24\/7.
The hallways were dark and the carpets bunched. Elevators were clean. 
Pool was disgusting, I read reviews on it before we went, they all said it was awful. I'll be honest, being from the northeast I thought...how bad could it be? I mean it's going to be 90degrees, I have a book, there's a chair....how bad could it be. Bad is an understatement. I am pretty sure there are public pools in NYC are CLEANER and NICER. It is literally a huge concrete area with two pools that are up about 5-6 steps that have very limited seating. Both drinks I got were undrinkable, there is a snack bar that probably compares to concessions at a little league game. We went once for 30 minutes and couldn't stay. 
The casinos were ok, dealers were very nice, there are a lot of options. It was super smokey though and other casinos appear to have an updated ventilation system.
We visited about 10 casinos while here and the hooker\/escort situation here was insane. I have never, in all the times visited seen so many in one hotel and so awkwardly out in plain sight, which may be good if you're into that kind of thing. Just a really low level spot.

The spacious room (#20sumsum'n), sparingly accented with props\/posters from the 1976 film Logan's Run, was designerly, despite the few bits of cinematic tackiness.  

The accommodations, though we were rarely actually IN the room to enjoy them, were luxurious.  Two large and comfortable queen beds with floor to ceiling padded\/felt headboards (oooh, rough!).  Two ""I can drunkenly sleep right here"" lounge chairs, a humongous dresser\/entertainment center w\/42""+ flatscreen teevee, and a simple desk round out the furnishings.

Our window, though large and [potentially] picturesque, faced out to the east(?) towards very little of a view.

Also note, in-room intarwebz costs an astronomical $14 per day (s'why you didn't see me yelping last Saturday thru Tuesday!)

The bathroom was THE ooh-la-la!  The large, warmly-lit room is flanked by two sinks\/counters and two large mirrors.  At the center-back of the room is roomy bath\/spa.  To the left, a closet for the throne.  To the right, the plate glass-doored spacious shower... with a bench.  (mmmm, secksy!)

-The Pools-
The sixth floor.  The wide open space of the sixth floor rooftop is a little desolate on first impression.  Most of the immediate area is occupied by rows and rows of beach chairs.  The two pools at either side of the roof aren't anything particularly cutting edge, but it is where all the sun-bathing beauts are.  (yummm, hotness!)

-Casino-
The gaming floor at PH is not as much of a spectacle as those of other casinos.  Because of PH's dark color scheme (black and pink?) and the centrally located structure of Heart Bar, the expanse of the floor is broken up and somewhat less cacophonous.

The Pleasure Pit is awesome, a set of card\/game tables dealt by scantily clad women as well as entertained by scantily clad dancers prancing about on nearby stages...  How could you not dig that...?  Makes it a little hard to concentrate though...

The Poker Room is one of the nicer Hold'Em rooms on the strip, IMO, since it is not totally secluded; I can sit at the nearby Extra Lounge and watch my homegirl charm and victimize other players into bad beats and dumb calls.  Heh, suckas!

The shopping area is in the shape of a circular path; when you get off the escalators you can start walking in one direction, and if you keep walking you will end up in the same place.

Parking is pretty simple- love how easy it is to hop in the garage elevator and step out at the Miracle Mile shops, past the theater, and then to the casino. Decent poker area, lots of slots. Restaurants are all pretty solid- Koi is overpriced IMO but tasty and a good place to be seen if you're into that sort of thing. Their crispy rice app is to die for too, BTW.
The buffet isn't among the best on the strip, but it's decently priced and has a larger selection than I expected. And the Heart Bar is good for people watching and has dancers for entertainment, too.",5,0,1

The room was fairly updated and really clean, Restaurants are all good too and great for casual dining. Try Burgr and Koi.
The minus one star is for the pool. I was really surprised that Bally's had a better pool area. There weren't a lot of chairs around the pool . There were a lot of cabanas and day beds that looked really faded and worn, and no one was really using them so it seemed like a waste.",0,0,0

Since I'm being generous, I'll give them a three star rating. This hotel has some good, some bad, and some ugly. I guess I'll start with the good and go from there. 

Good:
*Middle of the strip location. 

*Connected to Miracle Mile shops and eateries. 

*Each room has a different theme. Ours was Star Treck. 

*Room amenities (bed, TV, bathroom, etc) are middle of the road. Not the best, but not bad either. For as little time as we spent in the room, it worked for us.

*Couple of decent pools with Black Jack tables in the pool area. Score! Sun, water, booze and gambling? Can't beat that!

*The Casino connected to the hotel was nice. They had a lot of awesome dealers and I really liked that. 

*Decent prices for the rooms (compared to other hotels that are comparable to PH). 

*...that's about it on the ""good"". 

Bad:
*They charge you extra for gym access. Why? I wanted to work out one day to work off all the calories I was consuming, but couldn't justify paying extra for what was probably a small and not impressive gym room.

*They charge you extra for WiFi. No wonder my phone's internet barely worked....they probably wanted me to pay extra for WiFi. That didn't happen either. 

And now the ugly...this is where this hotel gets not so great stars in my book:
*Two months prior to our trip -- My party of 8 came here for my boyfriend's sisters birthday. My boyfriend booked four king sized bed rooms two months in advance. He also requested that all four rooms be on the same floor. 

*One month prior to our trip -- My boyfriend called the hotel to double check that all four rooms will be on the same floor. The staff that answered said that they'll put the request in and it shouldn't be an issue. Awesome. 

*Day of check in -- Check in is 4pm. We got there at 3:30pm, only to be told that all our rooms won't be on the same floor and that all of the rooms would only have queen sized beds. To get king sized beds, we'd have to pay an extra $50 for an ""upgrade"" (even though we booked king bed rooms). The staff proceeded to tell us that we didn't get all our requests met because we were checking in ""late"", even though we were there 30 MINUTES BEFORE CHECK IN! We were floored. Especially since the lady who was helping us was rude beyond belief. She was giving us attitude and wouldn't accommodate us on anything. Hello! We booked our rooms way in advance and got to the hotel before check in. Also, it also took us 45 MINUTES to check in! What! Really? Why? Is checking in four rooms that difficult? It really should only take 15 minutes max. Plus, we saw about six families check in while we were being checked in. Frustrating. 

*End result -- two couples in our party decided to upgrade and pay the extra $50. The other two parties who didn't upgrade were stuck with two queen sized beds with a shitty view. One couple in our party was put on a separate floor too. The three rooms that were on the same floor weren't remotely close to each other either. 

*The day after we checked in -- my boyfriend decided to complain about our check in process to a manager. The manager either couldn't, or didn't, defend what had happened. The manager did extend our check out time from 11am to 1pm on the day we were checking out. It was the least he could do, but I don't think it was enough to justify what had happened during check in. 

All in all, I'd give PH a higher rating since I thought they were a pretty solid hotel. What pissed me off was the whole room situation and checking in. It could have been handled so much better and oh so differently. Because of that, 3 stars only from me for this hotel!

Cheers!",5,3,3

A day later I checked my balance and they had taken $400 as a deposit.  I was in disbelief.  So I called down to have them close my card out and bill me for the $20 per night upgrade.  Now they inform me there are $24 per night resort fees.  Was never told about these charges either.   Plus, I already paid my resort fees when I initially paid for the room.  So why am I being billed for something twice?  They couldn't give me a straight answer to that question.  So after the $20 upgrade per night, the $24 resort fee per night, and the tax...I had a $185 room upgrade.  

Honestly, that's not a bad upgrade fee for being on the 37th floor (one floor below the penthouse) with a Vegas Strip view.  I am not upset about that.  I am really upset about the $400 deposit and the lack of information given at the time of the upgrade.

GOOD---------------------------------------------
+Huge room outfitted with actor costumes from '97 Taratino film, 'Dusk Till Dawn'; large, high def TV; view of Paris' Eiffel Tower; huge tub and separate shower; two sinks.  

+Casino:  Decent and active.

+Central Strip Location.  Adjacent to Paris. Directly across from humongous City Center that's due to open this year (if it doesn't stall like other LAS developments up the strip.)

+Well maintained property.

BAD------------------------------------------------
-Ridiculously long check-in line.  (Why do Vegas hotels, even fine ones, do this to their guests?  It is such a buzz-kill.  Folks trek here for special fantasy holidays and they're immediately confronted with a long line that painfully reminds them of how unimportant they are.)  

-Amazingly little furniture in my huge guest room.  There's an entry alcove large enough for a dinner table for four.  Yet, there's not a scrap of furniture here--not even a much-needed luggage stand!  There's the huge bathroom with two vanities and sinks, facing 12' apart. But there's nada to fill the huge abyss, like an accent table.  

--Pool Hours.  Dang thing doesn't open until 9AM. Huh? The only time its bearable to swim in LAS during summer is early in the morning.  Yeah, not at PH.

--$5 resort fee.  Sure.  I asked.  It's for the bottle water, newspaper and local phone calls.  Right.  Does ANYONE make calls from their hotel phone anymore???

So that at 7PM I finally phoned housekeeping told them about the bag and headed out.  See, I figured that I did not need to also phone Room Service, as Housekeeping would see the dirty table  while picking-up the trash.  Nope.

The bathroom is sweetness and when I say that I mean shower && tub!! 

The location of PH is also ideal.  Basically in the middle of the strip, across from City Center & near Caesars & MGM.  The shops here will definitely keep you busy and on a wild goose chase for the exit.  Tho I'm not a big shopper at hotels...they do have affordable stores for the young & thrifty which I appreciate.  There are also many restaurants & bars sprinkled thro the mall so where ever you turn I""m sure you'll find a place to get ur grub or drink on.  

Plus, they have Blondies which is supposedly a really fun place to chill out and play around with your friends.  I didn't have time to go but it sure looked like a fun place to be. 

Casino is nice.  I'm not a big table person but I do occasionally play the slots.  I'm a fan of the Deal or no Deal game hehe.  It's my newest obsession.  And it does build a crowd behind you so don't underestimate the game!!!

Don't park in the self park if you are staying here!! HAHA.  Valet is FREEEEE so make sure you take it while you can.  The self-park drops you off in the middle of miracle mile so if you have ur luggage you'll have to trek 5 miles to get to the lobby...not advisable!!!!! Pay the tip, get ur car valeted!

Room: Run down and not the cleanest.  Safe didn't work, could hear the people next door quite clearly, and the bathroom breaker kept tripping. I couldn't plug in two things at once.

Pool: freezing! A heated pool would have been nice.

Customer Service: Check in was easy and friendly. Went to retrieve pic from Lionel Richie concert and this ""under tall"" flamboyant individual couldn't be bothered and was quite rude to us, but, fortunately, the security guard and the lady in the office were most obliging and helpful. They understood the hotel is there to make money. The little fellow with an attitude I would have fired on the spot had I been someone of importance. PH, I can point him out in a heartbeat if you need to unload some baggage! Lil' F'er. 

Will say I won $1800+ and loved Paul who cashed me out! Very sweet, honest, hard working employee!

Waitress charged me $12 for a drink while playing. Boooooo!

Not sure Gordon Ramsey would approve of his restaurant.  Food was okay. Service was fantastic! 

All in all, stay elsewhere. Good luck!",3,1,1

We had a room on the 38'th floor that offered an excellent view of the strip. We were pleasantly surprised by the room, especially because we booked it last minute and still got a great price for it. The room was clean, spacious, well decorated, and the beds were comfortable.

As previously mentioned in other reviews, the restaurants within the complex are quite pricey. The Miracle Mile shops are attached to the hotel and offer a lot of shopping options for those who are into that.

All encounters with staff were positive, no one was rude or abrasive.

The only minor gripe I have about the hotel is the parking. The parking garage is located quite a distance from the hotel lobby. One must walk through a very long stretch of the Miracle Mile shops before arriving at the hotel lobby. This can be quite trying and cumbersome when carrying luggage.

Would definitely stay here again.",4,0,1

We booked Planet Hollywood on a whim. I'm glad we did! 

We arrived very early for our room, 10:00am, but were pleasantly surprised to find the room ready for our arrival. We went up and got all settled in. 

It's easier to just make a list of the pros and cons - 

Pros - 
Location - perfect. 
Easy in and out on foot - much improved from the former property. 
Busy and exciting - a lot going on in that place. 
Great room - size was huge and I enjoyed the large bathroom with the shower and toilet separate. 
Modern amenities 
Lots of food and shopping options. 

Cons - 
There were a lot of younger people staying at this hotel. It was loud in the afternoons and evenings, but quiet at night. 
There seemed to be a lot of drunkies in the elevators and on the casino floor. 
There seemed to be a lot of just kind of 'hanging out' in the hallways at all hours of the day and evening. 
There seemed to be a lot of 'pretty people' at the pool. I'm not pretty and not interested in a bikini contest. 
Difficult in and out in a taxi. Although the location on the strip is good, the taxis go around back. I would estimate the wait time to make the turns into the taxi area adds $5 to the tab. 

In looking back, it was a great option, but I don't see myself as hip. I'm glad we stayed there, but would more than likely not stay again.",3,3,2

He assigned us a new room, but wasn't the wow experience I was hoping for, the new room was just ok. I had made reservations months in advance and turned out to be really disappointed in this aspect of our trip. Wifi was in and out. Few outlets for chargers in the room. Our toilet didn't work, and we didn't have hot water. Fortunately I purchased VIP tix to see Britney and she absolutely crushed it, such a fun show! Saved the trip. We lost $500+ gambling as well, tables weren't hot. But hey at least the ice machines worked!

It's centrally located on the Strip, has all the modern decor \/ bells and whistles, and a younger crowd. There's go-go dancers all over the casino floor and good looking ladies as your dealers in table games to up the vibe too as well! Nothing like a little eye candy while making (or losing) monies. 

The good:
- Central location
- Miracle Mile has lots of shopping opportunities
- Earl of Sandwiches is right downstairs
- Excellent decor \/ modern ambience
- Big selection of slot machines and table games
- Soft poker games full of fish
- Great looking ladies as dealers and go-go dancers

The bad:
- Their nightclub leaves a lot to be desired...go to XS \/ Marquee for a much better time 
- No all you can eat buffet restaurant that I was able to easily find
- Rooms are on the smaller to average side..don't expect to get pampered...more of a room for you to crash
- The price point for Vegas is not pricey, but it's not cheap. Without comps \/ discount deal this place is slightly overpriced for what you can especially in terms of amenities

We got a ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" themed room with pictures of Geena Davis and Samuel L Jackson and the winter jacket displayed that Geena wore in the movie.  The bathroom was HUGE and very clean, as was the rest of the room.  The reason for only 4 stars is because I think the casino was a little boring, the slots seemed dated, but I sure did enjoy the ""Takes the Cake"" and Britney Spears slots!  The Miracle Mile shops were nice, but the vendors at the booths in the middle of the walkways at the mall were extremely pushy and some were down right nasty when you tried walking by without acknowledging them.

I'm a huge fan of PH, and come here to eat and gamble even when I'm not staying here.  The hardest part for me is deciding where to eat, because every offering is fantastic. Pampas, Todai, Spice Market, BURGR, Pink's, Pin Up, Earl of Sandwich, Cheeseburger, Ocean One, and on, and on, and on. No where else in Vegas does one hotel\/casino have so  many great places to eat under one roof.

The rooms are large enough and very comfortable.  We had a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the Strip.  As with most places in Vegas, the room could use a few more conveniently located outlets, so I didn't have to charge my phone on the floor in the only available outlet.  The bathroom was big and spacious, and had a big soaking tub, separate shower, and separate room with the toilet.  Overall, very well thought out.

PH is located in the best possible spot on the Strip, with every place I like to play cards being an easy walk in one direction or the other.  As for the poker room, I will play 1\/2 at PH, but since they don't offer a limit game for my wife, we go elsewhere when she's in the mood.  The slot machines were great some days and awful other days.  With respect to payouts, it was as though they swung wildly from Scrooge McDuck to drunk-bachelor-at-a-strip-club.  Gotta be a science to it I don't understand, but if I could time it just once...

Maria at Spice Market is great.  Thanks for the mimosas!

Love the music at night.

That aside, PH was pretty awesome. It's a great location, there's a good crowd there. The Miracle Mile Shops were a fantastic place\/temptation and there was a wide array of restaurants to go to. The staff were really helpful. The room we stayed in was the Donnie and Marie room; it was great, aside from the mirror. The bathroom was fabulous with their double vanity, one on each side of the bathroom. The room was spacious; it had two queens and room for a sleepaway bed. And speaking from experience, the chairs in the room are super comfy, comfy enough to sleep in. The view from our room was Paris and Bellagio fountains so that was pretty sweet :) The elevators were always pumping music I wanted to sing along and dance too so that was also fun lol. Another sweet perk of staying here: Earl of Sandwich lol. I love it so much that I started my day there and ended my day there lol. I'd stay here again just for the convenience of having them in the hotel lol.

I think the only thing I didn't really care for was the parking or trying to get to it. There's no entrance from the strip, you have to go onto Harmon I believe to get to the parking, valet and cabs. Their buffet was all right, but for the price you pay, you can get better food at the other places on the strip. Also in the elevators, they have their screens not on the side or above the panel; they have it on the roof. I didn't care for that either. I didn't get to check out Gallery so I can't comment on their nightclub.

SO the bf and I stayed here our last night in town as a sort of ""staycation"" since we were moving and all packed up.  We were Vegas locals of almost 5 years until we moved a month ago.  I'd never seen the inside of Planet Hollywood's rooms, but I always saw GREAT prices online for their rooms, and the locations is really good (pretty central Strip, right across from the GORGEOUS Cosmopolitan hotel and the Bellagio and their Fountains).  That being said... depending on how much of a diva ( or ""divo"") you are it could work for you; the location being the BEST attribute.
Moving on to the rooooooooooms: Yea, no... maybe? The rooms definitely need some upgrading. There was rust spots on some of the fixtures in the sinks, and you can just tell they need to do some work.  We honestly were surprised at how ""not good"" it was.  It wasn't horrible, but it's just amazing how these Vegas hotels put so much time and money in to the frill and fluff of the casinos, bars, restaurants, etc... but then once you get to the rooms there is much to be desired.
My main complaint was that when we got to our room, it looked like either housekeeping did a half-ass job, or either a guest snuck back in after they cleaned.  I don't know (I'm hoping the latter) because, it was pretty gross.  There was a empty shopping bag and shoe box near the trash can, and then we kept ""finding"" little things... A hanger on the floor, a glass that looked like it wasn't cleaned,  the armoire\/entertainment center was dusty AS HELL (like, really? dusting takes 2 seconds??), and the CATCHER:
I get in to the bathroom to freshen up before we head back out, and there's tissues and a PANTY LINER wrapper in the trash, and a washcloth (which seemed to have been used) on the floor next to it.  We were so grossed out that we thought about going back down to ask for a new room, but we had plans and no time.  We called down and a housekeeper came up pretty quickly, and we even made her change the sheets (just in case).  A manager called up a few minutes later sending their apologies, and commented that they placed a $25 food and beverage credit on our room  It was a nice gesture, but they could've done MUCH better than that.  We didn't fuss or fight... we're the ""it is what it is-keep the drama to a minimum"" type people.  After all of that, however, we see why their rates are so low.  We won't be back or recommend this hotel to anyone (without warning first).",0,1,0

We got to the hotel by 11 am and figured we wouldn't be able to check in, since it was so dang early. We decided to press our luck. Luckily, the guy had an available room and check in took a total of 10 minutes, if that. We stayed on the 25th floor, room 2559 to be exact, LOL! We got crazy lucky, because our room actually had a strip view (not perfectly since, you can see the part of the PH hotel jutting out), but good enough where the Cosmopolitan was right in front of us, and we could see half of the bellagio fountain show! And I was happy since we didn't pay for it! Our room was spotless, clean, spacious and fun!! People who say the decor ""is worn"" is smoking crack! It was very nice and nothing was worn. The bed was beyond comfy, sort of a tempurpedic feel. The bathroom was huge with a fun tub. The one minor hiccup was that we came home around 3 am, after going to a club. We were tired, feeling gross and sticky from the heat and we wanted to take showers. The water, was apparently turned off. My hubby called the front desk and they said housekeeping was supposed to leave a note. We never found one. Then my hubby spoke with the manager, who was extremely apologetic and told him he would take care of teh situation. They kept apologizing and the manager was embarassed. I don't blame them, but housekeeping. Besides that minor hiccup, our stay was flawless and we will be back!!! BTW, if you want to get a good deal, actually try their website!

I loved our room despite the uber-cheesey decor. We stayed in ""The Cliffhanger"" room (Hollywood Hip Room Suite?). It has a couple of memorabilia from the movie displayed in the room and some Stallone pictures. I love the 42-inch plasma TV and the HD channels...yup, HD channels. I love the tub even though it's not a whirlpool tub. It still has remnants of the Aladdin days in the bathroom decor but whatever, we didn't really care about all that. 

The casino is pretty tiny. I thought it's this massive hotel but not really. I do like that it's connected to the Miracle Mile Mall though. I like having access to Sephora whenever. 

And what the hell is with the pool? They need to do some serious decorating and landscaping. It's pretty much two rectangular pools slapped onto a concrete slab with a bunch of ugly lounge chairs. Come on, PH is alll about making their guests feel like a celeb or a rockstar and this pool did not have that celeb\/rockstar vibe at all. It was BORING! My husband also checked it out one day and he said the water was gross and dirty. Gross!

The other pool (the one for the PH Towers) is so much better but you have to be staying at the Towers to have access to that pool, I believe.",0,0,0

Check out was easy. Room was very cozy and clean, TV worked fine, there was shower and bathtub in my room. It was very quite. Only thing I did not enjoy was my room had a very small window looking back, anyways, I wasn't in Vegas to stay in my room. Again, location was very good, I walked to everywhere, Cleaning service was okay, one time they cane at 4pm, it was little late for me but let them clean anyway. I also used spa (hot tub and sauna), they were okay, nothing spectacular to report. My problem with spa was that there was no quite room to rest. Casino was fun, dancers were entertaining.

The clientele here is very young, so naturally the casino is crowded and loud, two things I dislike.  But if you're a youngin, this would be a good place for you.  If I was 21 again, I would love this place.  It's also one of the newer hotels on the strip.  So everything looks nice and new.

Our hotel room was not good.  The tub was dirty.  There were lots of hairs in it.  We had to call housekeeping to clean it.  YUCK!  One of the lamps were broken and because the furniture in the room was black we could see all the dust.  It was like they didn't dust in weeks.  The tub though, is HUGE.  The biggest tub I've seen in a hotel room so far.  CRAZY HUGE!  There was a picture frame of an ugly looking vampire thing hanging on the wall.  That was pretty disturbing.  Most of the lights had this switch attached to it that was on the ground so that you could press it with your foot and the lamp would go on.  That was pretty different.  Other than all of that, the room actually looks very nice.

Parking = HORRIBLE
After we parked our car we had to walk through The Miracle Mile Shops to get to the casino\/hotel room.  No one wants to walk that far.

The only thing I can honestly say that I like about this hotel is Earl of Sandwich.  For those of you that have no idea what I'm talking about, think about Subway or Quiznos, but WAAAAAY BETTER!  Try it, you'll love it.

I absolutely love coming to Las Vegas  and I always try and stay at different hotels to experience a little something different each time I visit. This was my first time staying at Planet Hollywood and for the price of the room and the location on the strip I figured it would be great. 

I checked in on 11\/30\/17 and when I got to my room I almost immediately noticed trash on the floor near the beds. There were ripped sales tags from clothing and broken pieces of a children's toy on the floor.  I'm not one to complain much(remember this is my first bad yelp review) so I just figured housekeeping did a terrible job at cleaning and I just threw the trash away myself. As I put most of my belongings away and went to the bathroom I then found more trash ‍. There were open packets of sugar on the floor in front of the toilet and to top it of the side of the toilet was broken\/hanging off. I still decided not to be a complainer and just throw it away and fix the toilet to the best of my ability. 

Fast Forwarding to 12\/2\/17... 

This was the tip of the iceberg. I misplaced my wallet and decided to pull the bed sheets all the way down to the foot of the bed to see if it was there. Lo and behold there was a large stain\/ring on the sheet that looked possibly like a urine stain. When I pulled that sheet back it was on the sheet under that as well. I had slept in a bed for two days with unwashed sheets.  DISGUSTING! At that point I took photos (wishing I had taken photos of the trash from 11\/30\/17) to show the hotel manager. Unfortunately, I never got to speak with a manager so I have come to yelp.

I bet half of the people here wouldn't be staying here if they weren't watching Holly Madison strut her stuff. 
 
The Heart Bar lounge was just ok, but I think this hotel caters to people in the 35-45 age range. Planet Hollywood doesn't even have a club! We went to Koi Lounge  because it was ""Ladies Night""-free for ladies, guys pay $20, but apparently every night is ""Ladies Night"" LOL! Girls get a pink cup and you can't share with the guy.1 drink for a guy will cost you $17, without tip. There isn't anywhere to chill-no room to anyway, and everyone just stands around, which was Lame!

Staff:  The staff is fantastic!  Just about everyone one we encountered at the front desk, bell desk, valet, housekeeping, the casino and a couple of restaurants were fantastic.  They were helpful in every way and seemed genuine.  Several times I observed the employees going out of their way to help each other.  That is rare to see.  They get paid to help the guests, but to help each other they must be happy employees who feel like a team.  Love it!  

Decor:  The mood and ambiance throughout the entire hotel and casino was young and inviting.  The decor incorporates geometric shapes and lots of sparkle.  The seating everywhere was really comfortable whether at  a bar, slot machine or casual seating. 

Room:  The view from our room was of the strip.  We were able to watch the water show at the Bellagio from our 33rd floor window.  Pretty cool.  Inside it was clean and well kept.  The furnishings were comfortable.  It room, however was a little small.  There was only one chair with a side table and the bed.  I would have liked to have another chair instead of one of us having to sit on the bed.

Food:  We had room service, Planet Dailies, and the buffet.  Room service and Planet D are probably the same kitchen.  The menus are pretty close, but the food is good.  The buffet was very good.  There was a large selection of high quality food and the service was surprisingly good.  

Casino:  There is a large variety of slot and video poker machines.  The tables were $10 min which was disappointing during the day when no one was there.  They should have dropped to $5.  The cocktail service in the floor was the best I have ever experienced in Vegas.  Unfortunately I did not see a lot of winning, but you could get a good buzz on while losing your money.  ;)

There is no fridge unless you tell the front desk you need one for medicinal purposes and they won't charge you. Otherwise there is a daily charge. There is also a daily charge for wifi $13.99 but if you go to the Starbucks it's free. 

The hotel location is perfect and in the middle of everything. The gentleman at hotel registration was very nice and accommodating. He gave us a complimentary upgrade with a view of the strip but it was located right next to the elevators. Room 3517 was very conveniently located and noisy if you have partyers on your floor or if you are opposed to hearing soaring winds from the elevator banks. If you are interested in getting some bottles of liquor there is a convenient ABC store located in the mall. Do not go to Walgreens, it is such a ripoff. The rooms definitely need some updating.  At night the pleasure pit turns lively with a bunch of girls gyrating to the clubby like music.  On weeknights, there are several prostitutes hanging around the elevator banks looking for some action.  

The mall is the best part of the hotel.  It is very nice and very convenient if you only need to grab a quick bite.  The best is Earl of Sandwich, this is a definite ""Must visit"" and so is Gordon Ramsey's BURGR joint in the casino.  Now that I've tasted the hell's kitchen burger, I will probably hate all others.

The hotel has a hip, glitzy vibe going on.  It's decorated in a sleek and modern fashion.  The rooms are spacious but not as big as Venetian's or Palazzo's.  The suite on the other hand was huge with all the amenities, 3 flatscreens, billiards table, 3 bathrooms, bar area, separate dining area, etc.  I like that there's a mall attached to the casino.  There's been a couple of times were I forgot to pack something and had to run downstairs and over to Sephora, Steve Madden, or H&M.  I also love that there's a Starbuck's in the casino since I always need my daily latte fix.  My two biggest gripes about PH is that I don't get cell phone reception (a lot of people don't) downstairs in the lobby and valet area and that valet always takes forever, sometimes 20-45 minutes.  I've gotten to the point where I self park in the mall and just walk through.  

I did have one unusually bad experience at PH.  In one weekend, our room's TV broke, toilet broke, there was glitter all over the carpet (as if housekeeping totally skipped vaccumming), and crumbs in the bed (resulting in a rash all over when we got home, I hope they were crumbs).  Another weird thing I noticed about this hotel is little things break easily.  Once, I touched the bathroom door handle and the thing fell off in my hand.  I hung a dress on the edge of a chair and the end of it fell off.  Little things but notable, so dock a star.  Also, there's no pool.

I didn't gamble here, or eat here much, or see any shows here, or go to their clubs. What I DID do was mooch off my friend whose parents got her a panoramic suite for her 21st birthday for a weekend and let her invite whomever she pleased to do whatever she wanted. As awesome as that would be at any hotel, the panoramic suite here was amazing, and is what earns PH the three stars I'm giving it. Our suite had a killer view of the Bellagio fountain show, la Tour Eiffel, and l'Arc de Triomphe...I couldn't stop gazing out the window at night. The suite was fully equipped with a nice mini-bar, central tub, two bedrooms, lots of TVs, swank bathrooms...great fun for a group of young'uns!

In addition, guest services were very helpful with all our questions. We got plenty of keys to the room, there were some decent eateries in the vicinity, and the pool area was perfect for that sunny Vegas day. AND this place was super convenient. Most places you'd want to visit aren't more than a 15-20 minute walk away!

Downsides to PH? Well, I can't really complain about the lack of cleaning, since I think we specifically avoided that since we had...a large group inside. The parking lot is extremely far from the hotel, so that made hauling our...goods a huge hassle. So, all in all, not much to really gripe about.

The beautiful huge bathtub had someone else's hair in it- and I kept hoping each day it would be cleaned so I could use it, but never was :(. The room was very dusty, and the bedspread was sloppily thrown on the bed. The toilet only flushed half the time and the bathroom light looked like it was only half installed. :( :(
2) The ATM\/ticket cash in machines were all broken or out of cash!

I got the room for a very reasonable price, but would certainly stay somewhere else if it ensured a clean room.  Aside from the room, almost everything else was great!",0,0,0

This place was poppin' during Memorial weekend. They have a pretty big pool. DJ spinning the latest and greatest hip hop tracks. Younger crowd. Different contests going on. Bikini contest for girls and push ups for guys. 

I didn't see any servers at all. Kinda sucks that you have to go to the bar every time. Every other pool I went to had servers so I was kind of spoiled from that. This was the most packed pool I went to though so I can see why it makes more sense for people to get drinks themselves.",3,0,1

I thought that it was perfect for my age group (mid 20's).  After visiting many other casino's on the strip...I think our casino was definitely the hippest...and most fun! Double plus---Miracle Mile Shops!!  I can seriously see people not leaving the hotel!  It has so much to offer!  Our rooms were pretty decent...wish there was more lighting tho, room seemed dark...bathroom was amazing!!  I thought the hollywood movie theme to each room was cute too.  The free bottle of premium vodka was a plus and saved us a good $45! Wish we had a coffee maker in the room tho. 

The location on the strip is perfect.  I feel like it's in the heart of the strip, right across the street from the new City Center.  

I would recommend this hotel definitely!! I feel as if all the hotels in Vegas will put any normal hotel to shame.  Hard to be really disappointed! :)",3,1,1

It seems as if they are understaffed a little. My Dad flew in from Ohio, so we only stayed one night. We had the basic room with 2 queen beds. The room and bathroom were open and pretty big, especially the bathroom. The decor was a little cheesy, but I think that is the whole point of the casino....cheesy nostalgia. Everything was clean in our room, including sheets. Do NOT use the bar soap they provide. You will feel like every drop of moisture has been sucked from your body. If you do, use the lotion! 

The casino was nice. We went to a little Mexican grill on the casino floor. We both got steak quesadillas and they were awesome. They came out really quick too. They recommended those and tequitos for Poker players who need to be in and out. 

The only downfall was the understaff and when we checked out, the bottom floor smelled like horrible sewage. That was a huge turnoff and I wanted to leave immediately. I thought the woman walking in front of me was passing gas. lol

Pro's 
* Bed & Pillows are nice, soft & not hard. 
* Bathroom is large, lots of counter space.
* Fe, the housekeeper, was very nice & did an excellent job at cleaning & securing our room. 
* Nice big mirrors & one that goes lengthwise too! Nice to see the whole outfit together! Hehe
* Big tub!!!! Bring your bubble bath! Or buy some at the mall downstairs.
* Separate Shower (although it was kinda small)
* Great lighting in the bathroom! 
* Separate room for the pooper...hahaha  
* Nice Flat Screen TV. 
* Free Parking!
* Free Wifi (up to 2 devices)
* Room is pretty spacious

Con's
* Tables & other furniture in the room are pretty beat up. 
* Dark room even with all lights illuminated.
* Paid for a view & got ""sort of a view"" of the strip & the top of another floor with the most prominent view of A\/C  units, Lighting fixtures, 2 big pulley lifts 
* When Reception upgraded our King Size bed room for to a room with a view, they FAILED to mention that we were getting downsized a bed size. So, we slept less comfortably on a queen bed. :-(
* Memorabilia Company is supposedly responsible for maintaining the memorabilia in the rooms...so, that meant, inoperable lights, round display table, & wires everywhere (until housekeeping tucked it away)
* Drains: Sink\/Shower has a weird smell when water went down it. Like bleach\/egg\/sulfur... Couldn't pin it down...
* Weak plumbing! (I noticed that this was mentioned in another review too)
* Parking is far away. You have to walk thru the mall to get to the hotel, to get to the elevators, etc (but, it's free!)",10,6,6

We missed our dinner reservation waiting for our stuff to come upstairs from the lobby. After promising to comp the room service, they did bring it, 2 hours late, and charged us for it after we left- in addition to other mysterious fees that were not on the original price.

My brother, fiance, a friend, and I decided to stay at PH because my brother had a few free comped nights. We were there for 5 days (wed-mon) and was charged roughly $650. Pretty good deal we thought.

The day that we checked out (Monday), the bill came to $1500. Um, what?

We knew we messed up by using the wifi (13.99 per DEVICE), but there was no way it was going to be an additional $700 for wifi. When we went through the bill, we saw that there was a ""Pool Bar"" charge. We had NO idea what that was or what that meant. We went back to the front desk where Cecile helped us out.

She said the charge was from getting drinks at their pool. UM, what x 2??
We asked her what day was this because we only went to their pool ONCE on Thursday for like 30 mins and we never EVER went to the bar, just went there to tan. My brother had to work on the weekdays so he never even been to the pool. He had to work from the room. She told us it was on Friday. UM WHAT x 3?!?!

Cecile then told us she was going to call the pool and will get back to us when she talks to them. We left to the Miracle mall and received a call from Cecile 30 mins later. Came back to the front desk and she tells us, ""They said it was YOU, you were at the pool and they remember you."" Excuse me? Who is THEY?? Then she goes and ask, well maybe it was one of your friends who went. WTF? Definitely frustrated, she told us to step to the side and that she will have the manager come talk to us.

20 minutes pass and ROBERTO comes out from the back. There was another upset guest in front of us so Roberto was ""helping"" him first. Observing from the side, it was obvious that Roberto was one of those type of managers that was not willing to help you or hear you out. He even called security on the other upset guest. Whatever.

When it came to our turn, we explained to him why we were there. He did not make eye contact, just kept looking around and just basically NOT listening to us. We told him that Friday, NONE of us ever stepped into the pool. My fiance, friend and I were at Drais from 11am-3pm (where my fiance actually got HURT and we had to go to the hospital for him to get stitches. So we have proof that we werent there). My brother who was working in the room, had problems with the wifi, so he called for guest services around 11:30am and tech support came to the room around 330. He then left to go gamble downstairs from 4-6pm. The ""POOL BAR"" bill said that my brother was drinking it up from 12:35pm-5:20pm. THERE was NO WAY we were there.

After pointing this out and asking them to check the security camera and ALSO my brothers player card (since he was gambling during the time), Roberto then says he will have to call the Pool Manager to come down to talk to us.

We stood at the front desk for literally 1 hour. Roberto would pop his head out from the back room from time to time and ask if the pool manager came yet. Uh, no. 

FINALLY, a guy wearing a blue polo shirt steps out. He looks at us and so we ask,  are YOU the pool manager? He says yes. So this is CHRIS, the ""pool manager"". Having to tell him AGAIN what our situation was, he seemed a little bit more sympathetic. He looks at the bill and tells us, ""wow, the bill was $500 and there was already an automatic $80 gratuity, but then there was an addtional $120 tip, that does look very sketchy. It makes me question if my employees are checking ID."" In our heads we're like THANK GOODNESS someone understands. 

COMPLETELY WRONG.

He then proceeds to say, ""But these 2 servers are my best servers and they're good people so I can't see them doing that"". WTF? He then tells us hold on and goes back to where Roberto is. We can see the back door from here and for some reason they decided to close it.

5 minutes later they both come out and tells us, ""Sorry, there's nothing we can do about this now. You have to just dispute it with your credit card."" My brother then asked if he can get a copy of the pool bar receipt to see who signed it and Chris said they can't do that. He then leaves and tells my fiance ""hope you're doing better"". WTF.

Roberto then tells us again, they can't do anything about this now and that we have to dispute the charges. He grabs our bill and then tells us, ""oh but let me remove some of this wifi charges for you."" Ok, thanks for removing the wifi charges, but you can't remove the POOL BAR charge?!? Complete BS.

I've never been so frustrated in my life. They have security cameras, they can call the players card to check the times my brother gambled, they can call guest service to verify my brother called for help with the wifi, etc, but NOPE. 

WORST service ever and we will NEVER EVER stay here again.",45,3,0

Parking at this hotel is a hassle since you have to park at the shopping mall garage and walk through the garage which could be annoying at times.

Stayed here for 3 nights @ the Hollywood Hip room.....first of all, I understand this is PH but why oh why do you have scary pictures and a tuxedo framed up on the wall? that's just creepy!!! I heard too that some rooms have a theme of the exorcist?? man if that was my room i'd be pissed!

First of all, me and my friends stayed in a non-smoking room.....the bathtub smelled like clorox mixed with bacteria. I mean can they add some ventilation in the bathroom or something to rid of that smell when they clean it?! Beds are not comfy for the price of this hotel-- pillows at least were soft and fluffy..

what really made this experience HORRIBLE was, even after a night of drunken fun, i went to bed, turned on the a\/c...and was awoken in the middle of the night\/morning by the smell of cigarette smoke...!!! ughhh their ventilation here sucks as the cigarette smoke from other rooms seeps into the non-smoking rooms....This gave me a headache and made my hangover even worse. UGH. Oh, and when I called the front desk it took forrrevvver for them to answer the phones...Parking here is a nightmare because of the miracle mile shops but it is vegas so I accepted it...also, the TV is all messed up because if you push the menu button, you all of a sudden order porn!! and No i didn't push this button when i was drunk lol. the TV glitches definitely need to be fixed! Because of that we were all scared to accidentally order other stuff so we never turned on the TV. Oh and the big thing too that pissed me off about this hotel was THE LIGHTING IN THIS ROOM IS SO BAD! It is soooo dark @ night when you turn on all the lights. I can't see shit! and I can't find shit because if your huge ass luggage is in the corner and there are only 3 damn lights with the dimmest possible lighting, how the hell can i find anything?! 
The lighting in the bathroom was okay but I wish it was brighter just because I'm a girl and need good lighting to apply my makeup....

I guess i'm complaining a lot b\/c of the price of this room, and all the shortcomings, DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT! i WOULDN'T come back here to stay at this hotel.....i hate second hand smoke in MY ROOM!! Not cool at all-",5,2,3

Sure why not?! It is Vegas after all... why not be spontaneous. (Long story short, we were in a relationship for a year, so sometimes it is worth it to take a spontaneous chance). Anyways, onto the real reason you are reading this review... what I thought of PH.

Three of us arrive in the evening on a Saturday. The rest of the group who arrived the morning before are all passed out. We wander around the hotel, nothing too exciting or boring, just average... lots of shops and of course the casino. It appeared the crowd as this place was mostly those in their twenties\/thirties, a plus! We grab some liquor and head upstairs to start pre-gaming and getting ready. The rooms were clean and simple with a modern vibe going on. The bathroom was big... as four girls were able to get ready without much problem. The view was spectacular, we were able to see much of the strip. 

So we drink, we party, and drink some more. Decide on staying in the hotel for the night so we wander around and find ourselves inside the mess that is the ""line"" to get into Prive. It was a madhouse. The guys begin to get annoyed but we calm them down as we know it will be like this anywhere considering we didn't head out til about 12am. So we work our girly magic and in we are! Inside is a typical club scene: plenty of dance floors and VIP seating areas. Danced the night away til about 4 am. 

Next day we spent time at the pool. A few nice large pools with plenty of lounge chairs everywhere. This is no Intervention pool party but still a fun time. Then it was off to explore the strip before headed back home to the real world after a fantastic whirlwind 24 hour trip.",2,4,6

We called downstairs and told them this would not work as we needed access to the shower and they pretty much said they could not give us any other room and to call the next day between 12pm and 2pm? How would that in any way help?! 

After charging exorbitant prices for our Thursday,  Friday and Saturday nights stay, they could not even convenience us with a room change? I highly doubt that every room was booked. This is terrible customer service on PH's part and I would NOT recommend staying here. 

We should absolutely be getting compensated for Friday's stay, when the water was shut-off and we had no access to shower\/toilet\/sink. We were completely inconvenienced and had to go downstairs to the casino just to use the restroom because the toilet in our room wouldn't flush.

The same goes for many other places we checked. I blame EDC 2017 for that. (Electric Daisy Carnival) for those who don't know. 

We stumbled upon PH with a decent rate and learned that all of their rooms were recently remodeled, so it's almost new. The check-in counter guy was nice enough to look hard to get us a room with a Strip view on the 34th floor. It wasn't the best, ie. facing the Bellagio fountain, but we were right in front of the City Center, which was pretty stunning.

The room was clean, modern, and a decent size. A chaise lounge was placed by the window. There's also a small seating area against one wall and a desk area that no one ever uses. 
The bathroom was nicely decorated with LED lights behind the large mirror. Only drawback; the shower's water pressure was very weak. 

Overall, it was a pleasant stay. It was quiet, clean, nothing malfunctioned and the location was very convenient. 

You should know:

* It's a far walk from the parking lot to the check-in desk. If possible, drop off some people with the luggage so the walk isn't so challenging. Follow the signs on where check-in and self-parking areas are as you enter the casino's parking area.
* Parking 'for now' is free. But they may follow the other greedy casinos and charge a fee in the near future. Call ahead to confirm.
* Miracle Mile shops is attached to the casino, which makes shopping pretty easy. There's also a huge 24 hour Walgreens
* If you need caffeine, there are 2 Starbucks and a Coffee Bean. All of their prices are inflated. But hey ... what's a caffeine addict to do? 
* Elevators are separated to 2 sections. One brings you up to the 23rd floor, the other goes from 24th & up.
* The pool is on the 6th floor. There's a 21 & over area and a family friendly pool, which is only 3.5 ft deep throughout.
* Cabanas are for rent, at about $100. Call to verify rates
* There's also a Wave Rider, simulated surfing. Also call for rates.

This place is not a shithole at all but like others has been saying, you can still see traces of the former hotel that use to be here. But other then that I enjoyed my stay at the P.H, great location on the center strip. One quick elevator ride\/quick walk to the miracle mile shops.

Rooms were clean, nice bathroom with huge tub for two people ;) My only minor complaint is that the housekeeping people come really early in the morning, like 8am ready to clean up while I'm washing up my balls in the shower. 

I can't say too much about the casino since I don't gamble like that, but they have pretty much everything you'd wanna play and penny machines for the high rollers like myself. Overall I would stay here again but it would have to be for a great deal like I got in the first place.",1,4,0

They have some pretty cool games here that I didn't see at any other casinos on the strip. So if they've got a Deal or No Deal game at one casino, they have the giant big-screen, two-player version here. If they've got those lucky little Wheel of Fortune games at another casino, they have the whole damn wheel, surrounded by seats here. 

These are just examples for comparison, but my point is that the games are newer and more fun here.

I also think that this casino might be non-smoking, because I didn't see any ashtrays anywhere and the air smelled uncharacteristically clean. I'd definitely come back here to gamble. The sandwiches? Eh, good but not worth a trip by itself.

I have been to Vegas several times before and really like the location of Planet Hollywood. We stayed there 4\/21 - 4\/25. I had not stayed there before or been in any of the rooms. After we booked the trip, I read the reviews on yelp and I was concerned about what the experience would be like. Well, I was extremely satisfied with the resort and very happy with the room. 

The room had a king sized bed, a soaking tub, separate shower, separate room for the toilet and bidet, and two sinks with ample counter space. The water pressure in the bathroom was strong. The resort fee ($22.40) includes use of the fitness facility and Internet for two devices. The policy recently changed to allow two devices to access the WiFi for each room. Previously, only one device was included in the resort fee. The WiFi was very fast and reliable. 

The check-in experience was smooth and efficient. We were upgraded to a larger room with an absolutely incredible view of the Strip, Paris, and The Bellagio. The room itself was immaculate. It was clean and there were no fingerprints on windows or other things that people in other reviews mentioned. We used the shower right when we got there and realized that the drain was not working properly in the shower or one of the sinks. I called maintenance about this problem and someone was at our door within 5 minutes! After about 15 minuets working on the problem, the drains were fixed. I have never had such a prompt response time at a hotel before. 

The bed was very comfortable. Although we were on the Strip side, there was no noise from the street. The housekeeping service was thorough every day. I have no complaints. 

I found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. I will recommend Planet Hollywood to friends and I will stay here again. I have stayed at the Cosmopolitan twice and the Tropicana once. Planet Hollywood has the best location (the Miracle Mile mall is a big plus!). There is a Walgreen's right next door. The mall has a couple of ABC shops (liquor and souvenirs) and the prices are reasonable.

The closet that we had was small and built in as part of the entertainment center.   Not very good lighting in the rooms either.  We upgraded to premier club because of the perks, but found that the club room served only nuts, juice, and water....different from the hor d'oeuvres the front desk lady promised.  At least I got spa access from the upgrade and a bottle of alcohol for each day.  The pool was okay, I expected more.  I didn't like how the pools were separated in two and they were fairly small.  Somebody threw up into the pool we were in so it was cleared and shut down...on a Saturday! Seriously rude...I mean at least get out of the water before you do that!!

With all the lights on, it was hard to see anything very well.  I'm all for places trying to hug trees and save on power, but this seemed a bit too far... or more likely poor planning.  The bed was OK.  I didn't spend much time in it, and when I did, it was more to just pass out... so I guess it was OK.  The bathroom had a nice big shower, but the tile was old and actually a little bit dirty (there is a star gone there).  There was a separate tub which looked nice, but did not look too comfy (not that I would want to jump into a Vegas tub period).  Otherwise, everything seemed fine... a bit old looking overall... but fine.

The casino was decent.  The waitresses were nice an attentive, which is a big plus.  The regular dealers were hit and miss, but the ""pleasure pit"" dealers were good (and obviously not bad to look at).  This isn't a big casino, but had a decent feel and good music.

I wasn't pleased. Fast forward to Pole Expo Weekend 2017 and OH YES!! Planet Hollywood has boasted about ""newly renovated rooms"" and lemme tell ya, THEY ARE NOT LYING!!! 

We stayed in a basic room with two beds for two people and WOW! So spacious compared to MANY rooms on the strip that barely give you enough space to breathe or spread out your luggage. Even the entrance could be considered a mini-lobby area. 

The bathroom was roomy as well. Dual sinks mirroring each other. A detached sunken bathtub that encompassed me quite well. The shower has a bench though lacking a caddy for soaps, shampoo, etc. The bench was used as a caddy and maybe that was the plan, though uncomfy.  

I didn't think Planet Hollywood was worthy of being under the Total Rewards - Harrah's - Ceasar's trademark. After visiting and experiencing the newly renovated rooms, I was quite mistaken. Planet Hollywood Las Vegas Resort & Casino is my new favorite place to stay.

Downside: Upon checking in, I wasn't too happy with our customer service agent who checked us in. First, she gave us a room with one bed when our reservations and Total Rewards Diamond status profile clearly states, ""two beds, lower floor, close to elevators."" We frequent Las Vegas three times per year. Second, after giving us a one-bed-room, she failed to give us instructions on how to get to this room. We walked out expecting the signs to be clear since she volunteered NO assistance. Yet that was not the case. Thus, we had to inquire with other staff. 

Once we ventured back downstairs to fix the error, we were greeted with a different customer service agent who was beyond helpful. She apologized for the error, informed us of the wait for our actual room and then gave instructions on how to get to the Diamond Lounge where we waited for their call to let us know our room was ready.

The bathroom was the nicest area of the hotel room. It was spacious with a large bathtub, shower, and a toilet in its own separate water closet. However, the main room was a different story. There were two rather small beds, an entertainment-center\/closet\/drawer-set, two armchairs and a desk. There was also a pair of men's pants in a glass frame on the wall. I guess it was to go with the Miami Vice theme but in my opinion, it was WACK. 

Upon  further inspection, I noticed several wet spots on the carpet and a whole damn CHICKEN WING on the floor near one of the armchairs. We called housekeeping and told them the problem. They said someone would be right up. A whole hour and a half later, a housekeeping staff member came up to the room. We pointed out the wet spots and the chicken wing. She looked around, then used our phone to call someone else. She was speaking a different language so I couldn't tell what she was saying. Then she told us she'd be back and left without doing anything about the chicken wing. 

We started getting ready to go out to dinner. About 45 minutes later we left our room and no one had come back yet. When we returned from dinner we saw that housekeeping left a big ass, loud ass floor fan to dry the carpet. However, the carpet was still wet....and the chicken wing was STILL there. 

The next day we left our room early in the day to walk the strip. When we came back to our hotel room, we saw that no one had been to our room to clean. We called housekeeping and they told us someone would come up. An hour passed and housekeeping still hadn't shown up. We called again and they told us (again) that someone would be up. We got dressed and went out for the night. When we came back, the room was still dirty. We gave up and went to bed. 

The next morning when it was time to check out, we told the desk clerk about the wet spots on our hotel room's floor, the housekeeping staff's negligence and the chicken wing. We ended up being refunded $45. 

Bottom Line: NO, I do not recommend Planet Hollywood. It does seems to cater more to people who only need a convenient place to sleep after going hard all night and that's really all I was looking for . But, housekeeping is a basic hotel commodity and Planet Hollywood's housekeeping sucked. 

Really, a chicken wing? It makes me wonder if they even changed the sheets.",1,4,1

Note that you can't take any containers (empty or not) into the pool area. Also, I think you're supposed to reserve the sofa bed\/umbrella things, but it was so hot that the area wasn't in high demand and we just snagged one.

Then, the next day, I tested out the blackout shades until about 2pm (they work well!) Beds were comfortable too, and everything was pretty much standard hotel. I will say, however, that the restrooms are the weak link. Glass shower doors aren't really conducive to sharing a room with a friend and expecting simultaneous bathroom access.

The rooms are of a decent size as is the washroom with deep jetted tub... but I preferred the rooms back in the day when this was Aladdin Hotel and Casino. The room cries for some amenities, at least a fridge (I get it, the hotel does not want you to be in your room but no comforts?) At least it appeared clean.
The slot machines here - forget it. They are all newer, not so fun, tight as a water frog's behind and I feel the whole gaming floor is not well laid out. Hard even to find a washroom in this place. Or an exit but I know this is done on purpose! Tricky casinos!
The place is always busy though, jumping actually. The Miracle Mile shops, (if it is still called that) is a wonderful place to shop (attached so you do not have to go outside at all) and I do enjoy window shopping. But I do not come to Vegas to shop really unless I make a special trip to the outlets.
Inside the casino there are all kinds of eateries in including Ramsays' Burger place. Ride the escalator up to get the Mezzanine Level to get to bars and restaurants - like the Strip Steak House. (NOT for kids) We ate there, it was ok. Overpriced of course for what you get but that is another review.
I give 1 extra star to this place as I got to sit a few tables away from Arnold Schwarzenegger and a bunch of his famous pals on NYE. Made for good convo at our table. Almost a 1 star loss\/wash however for having to also put up with Miley Cyrus, also with the group.
Would not stay here but others seem to enjoy it! I am returning in April for the 22nd time and will avoid. Main reason - bad slots!

This hotel is awesome. At first, the hotel Valet was ""full"". But after we told them we were hotel guests, they immediately took our car.

The front desk agent was awesome upon check-in. Being a totals reward member, we get comped standard rooms and sometimes upgraded rooms, but he went above and beyond and upgraded us to a strip-view suite, free of charge. We were originally only staying Friday\/Saturday night. So, a great start. 

The room was really nice. Separate bedroom with huge wall to wall windows overlooking the Cosmo\/Bellagio fountains, plus we were able to look down and see the hotel pool and across the way at the Cosmo pool. Beds are super comfy. There bathroom was palatial, almost like a room on it's own. One room with a sink and a dressing area and another room with a shower, tub and another sink\/dressing area. Hidden toilet with separate door. I loved the sunken tub which had a massive window over-looking the Cosmo\/partial strip. Plus there was a huge flat screen over it in case you didn't want to look out the window. 

The only negatives about the rooms were that since the pool was right below us, we could hear the music during the afternoon while we were trying to sleep in (so much for sound-proofed windows). Also, there's not that much ventilation in the bathrooms, so when you have to... Ahem... ""Go"", the smell stays in the bathroom for a while. But other than that, it was a great room. 

We checked out out on Sunday, then re-checked right back in after deciding to stay another night. Since the suite was no longer available, we were offered a standard strip-view room. It was nowhere as big as the suite, but still very well-appointed and had a nice window with a view of the Bellagio-Fountains. The bed was just as comfortable. It's also nice to see that the sunken tub is offered with all rooms, albeit without the huge window\/flat screen tv. 

The hotel also has a great mall inside of it, if that's your thing. At night, they have great music in the Casino and a younger crowd (20's to mid-30's). Plus for all the guys out there, they have almost-naked women dancing on tables everywhere. (I had a hard time keeping my husbands eyes from roaming). Lots of great restaurants in PH as well.

Overall, a wonderful experience at a pretty awesome hotel.",3,0,0

I normally like to book hotel right smack in the middle of the strip for easy access so I decided to give Planet Hollywood a try. At the time Planet Hollywood sound like a good choice with the fountain view room, easy access to miracle mile shops for my gal, and its right across from Aria\/Cosmo which is were the ceremony\/wedding will be held.

Location: It wasn't easy at first, especially for a first timer. Unlike most hotel, you have to drive behind the hotel in order to find the entrance for the valet parking. You also have to make sure you turn the right direction and stay in the right lane otherwise you'll end up at the Miracle Mile Shops valet parking lot.

Service: Valet was professional, front desk was professional. Both was dealt with at ease. As for housekeeping, here is where the complaint start *cracking knuckles*. 

The night before, we were attending a wedding having a wild night so that means we want to sleep in the next day. Around 10-11am the phone rang. Housekeeping called and ask if we called for maintenance to repair the leak faucet. I told her we did not. She say that she have record that we called. Again, I told her we did not call as I was checking the faucet and there was no leakage. Her response?!?!?! ""So, you want me to cancel maintenance?"" Irritated, I slam the phone. Not the best way to be woken up in Vegas not to mention her voice was harsh I swear when I answer the phone I thought it was my Mother on the other line.

Overall: Aside from the housekeeping experience, I would have given three stars but until Planet Hollywood repair the ice machine on the North side 7th floor, my two star shall remain in tack. We were there for 3 days and not once did the machine dispense ice. Every time I push the button the machine sound just like my mood, 'GRRRRR'.",8,10,6

I stayed at the Planet Hollywood Hotel on April 18-21. It was the most miserable hotel experience that I have ever had. 

Firstly, when I took the bus from the airport, the busses are instructed to drop guests off at a certain location. It was a long walk from that point to the hotel reception (on an underground street), and there was no one to assist with bags. I was traveling alone with a suitcase, a carry on, a computer bag and a infant car seat (meeting my family later), and I had to manage all this by myself. The hotel itself has double doors at the entrance, and they are neither revolving nor automated. And there is no doorman to open the door for you.

I had to stand in line for 45 minutes before I could check in to my room. I got a room with a view of the swimming pool (the alternative view is of back walls of the hotel). The view was very nice as I could see parts of the Vegas strip. The noise coming from the pool was so loud (loud music) that an afternoon nap was out of the question (and I was on the 18th floor!). You can not escape the blaring music. It's in the lobby while you're waiting to check in. It's even in the elevators. And while I think of it, if you don't want your kids to see the scantily clad women on the elevator doors, either blindfold them, or don't bring them to this hotel.

As a parent of young children, I try to get to bed at a reasonably early time. On my first night, at 2am, I was woken by loud noises coming from the adjoining room. Eventually I banged on their door, and told them to keep it down. The next morning, I called the front desk and told them about the incident. I told them that I wanted to move to another room, but all they could offer me was a room with no view, so I told them that I would stay where I was. I asked them to talk to the guests next door, and ask them to keep it down, but they were not willing to do that.

On my 3rd night, I was again woken by loud noises coming from next door at 1:35am. I called my neighbors on the hotel phone, and told them that they were creating a disturbance and needed to keep it down. They told me that ""this is Vegas, and we can do what we want"". I called hotel security, and asked them to deal with it. Half an hour later, I was again woken by loud noises, and so again I called security who told me that they were busy moving the guests to another room. At 3am, I was woken by the phone in my room. There was no-one on phone. 15 minutes later same thing. I called the hotel manager, and told him about it. He said that he would put a block on my phone. At 4am, I was woken by loud banging on my door. No one there. Again, I called the manager, and asked him to review the security tapes (he told me that there were cameras on the floors). 15 minutes later, some hotel employee knocked on my door to say that there were in fact no cameras on the floors, and asked if there was a problem. At 5am, I was again woken by banging on my door, and there was no one there. I never did get back to sleep, and got about 90 minutes sleep total that night. 

I had very strong words with the manager in the morning, and told him that I felt that the hotel had not done enough to halt this nightmare (these guests should have been removed from the premises or the hotel should have placed someone outside my door). I told him that the hotel needed to comp me a room for a future stay (not that I would actually want to stay at this hotel again). He told me that my inconvenience didn't warrant further compensation, and offered me a free breakfast..

The pools at this hotel are average.

Things I Wish Could Be Better:
- Rooms. The rooms are cramped. We stayed in a two queen bed room and their was a huge coffee table and chair in front of the TV and one of the beds. To take a glance at the view from the window, you nearly had to climb over the armchair and squish by the coffee table. Too much work. 
- Insufficient number of outlets. I had to hunt around the room to find outlets to plug my electronics. Outlets should be clearly visible and accessible. 
- Wi-fi. Logging onto the wi-fi was too complicated. Why can't it be like the Hilton? Complimentary access for one day for the public. Take notes, Planet Hollywood. 
- Bathroom doors. The double doors were weird. Just keep it simple and all would be gravy.

One night, I coughed up in bed. My wife requested new sheets and four cleaning ladies arrived to changed them. Minutes later security arrived and requested my wife to go down stairs for 'questioning'. They were extreme rude, accused her of being a hooker and charged us $900 for the bed (which they just covered in plastic for us to sleep on). 

Ordering room service was not much better. The lady answering the phone was rude which caught me off guard. The rudeness seemed to be a theme throughout our stay.

This place is awesome. It was a bit boring and bland as the Aladdin (I do miss the Aladdin theme somewhat; the entrances used to have what I felt were quite accurate Muslim touches in it's design) but damn if it isn't all shiny and eye catching now. 

The exterior is a hell of a draw at night, though a bit muted and boring during the day. The changing exterior lights are a hint of what's to come on the inside. From the registration lobby to the casino, all of the lighting changes in a very pleasing manner. The remodel made the casino a hip and happening place compared to the boring Aladdin. I loved the redesign. 

Pleasure pit = 1 hot girl and a bunch of questionable ones. The lady friend was amused that I didnt find much eye candy to lead my eyes astray. Nice Idea I guess, but nothing spectacular either. Also, note the hourglass rocking the hot school teacher \/ librarian glasses. Talk about going after a niche fetish.

The elevators are tiled with this stained wood paneling. They are either stained orange, red, or dark blue (were there other colors?) that had striking wood grain. I loved the look, but can imagine getting disoriented if I stumbled into an elevator drunk. The tiles had convex circles of wood, giving the walls a very 3d appearance, and also changing the way light scattered off each tile, which is why I think it would be disorienting to drunks.. but hey.. who drinks in Vegas? no one..

Check-in was smooth. Mr. Jackson* got me a nice 3 step upgrade room atop the south tower, giving me a view of (from left to right) Cosmo, Rio, Bellagio, Ceasars, Mirage, and Paris. That very same Mr. Jackson also waived my ""resort fee's."" The room was situated as such that I had perfect view of the fountains with no obstructions. In a way, the windows caused me to burn too much time staying in the room instead of being out and about. Each fountain show is an excuse to procrastinate instead of getting ready to leave the room or to actually exit. Great room, great bed, great view, great bathroom. Aladdin sink handles, who cares. 

Hotel staff were very friendly, with room service folks pausing so I can get past with a friendly ""excuse me"" or ""after you"" instead of just charging past like a ... iono... a rhino?

Other staff complimented me or my better half, or mentioned that we looked great together, or were a beautiful couple. Lies, all lies! But they sounded genuine enough =P

Checkout was a breeze, no hiccups, nothing. 

Alright... onto the bad.

1) Ok, the purple chairs weren't the most comfortable, but really, they weren't bad. 
2) The magnified mirror thingy for makeup \/ contacts \/ plucking eyebrows?!? was somewhat broken? Well, Tyrone doesn't do much to maintain, so Tyrone don't care.
3) No tongs with the ice bucket. But since Tyrone is paranoid of what some people do with tongs in the privacy of their own rooms, Tyrone wouldn't have used tongs anyways.
4) When the bathwater was let out, you can hear a gurgling sound in one of the sinks but not the other..(although there was a sound, nothing bubbled up). There was a slight odor in the shower stall though. I assume since it doesn't have a p-trap (i guess) there isn't a liquid barrier to keep the air\/gasses down. (but since the sinks do have p-traps, you hear a bubbling\/gurgling sound?!?)

Anyways, that was it. Great location, great casino, nice rooms, great view, great staff... great stay. Would obviously do it again.

Ps. Had the Baywatch room ... which infinitely beats out ... oh .. I don't know... Hellraiser, the Exorcist... and others that I've heard about. Really? Exorcist? I'd demand a room change if I had that one.

The walk from the self parking lot is pretty far to the hotel lobby, but we were expecting that from the reviews we read. We just used luggage with wheels and the walk wasn't an issue. The room was clean upon arrival and was quite large considering it was only $23. The bathroom was HUGE!

While our stay was acceptable for the most part, we had one issue on our first day there. After settling in, someone decided to open our door, I'm assuming housekeeping, while both my fiancee and I were undressed. From what I understand, hotel staff is supposed to announce themselves when entering a room. There was no announcement from whomever opened the door and they closed the door before I could get to it.

If it was housekeeping that opened my door, their entry was done on purpose as housekeeping was outside my hotel room door upon arrival. The staff even moved their cart out of the way since it was parked in front of my door. SO I find it hard to believe that housekeeping had no idea we were in there.",0,1,1

The rooms are movie themed, ours had a bunch of memorabilia from Good Will Hunting.  The room was nice, with comfortable beds, a large flat screen tv, and a pretty big bathroom.

The only downside was the crappy towels; they really need to be replaced or washed differently because these were pretty rough.

The location is good too, right in the center of the strip.  Like any other Vegas hotel, it really depends on whether or not you can get a good deal.  I think on a weekend I'd pay up to $140 a night, and up to $75 during the week.  It's probably usually a lot more than that, but I always shop around.",1,0,1

Valet was full but attendant let me park in valet because we were staying the night. Guest checking was quick and helpful.  We paid extra for a view of the bellagio fountains.  The view was spectacular but you could not here the music, which took away from the enjoyment.  Seems easy for planet Hollywood to have a tv channel playing the music of the fountains.  The room was nicely laid out, bed was comfy, bathroom clean.  Had dinner at Burgr, which was outrageously expensive, but worth it.  Don't go without trying the onion rings and the Oreo shake.

During the night a water pipe burst and we had no water in our room.  We were not able to use the toilets or take a shower.  We spoke with management and they kindly refunded us the price of the room. Fantastic customer service.  My only other complaint is being forced to pay a resort fee for services I don't use.

When our company booked the luxurious 2,000 square-foot Apex Suite, we were told about the amazing party experience we would have. It was sold to us as the perfect place for our small company holiday party. 

An hour into our get together we receive a knock from security stating that the room next to us complained about the noise. We had begun to karaoke, so we turned the music down.  When we booked, we let it be known that we were having a company holiday party. We were not informed about any noise restrictions, on the contrary we were goaded on about the great party experience we would have. 
Again, we receive a knock from security over the amount of noise and the adjoining room complaining. We turned the music off. 
FYI, this suite has a foosball & pool table included, those two things themselves make a considerable amount of noise. 
An hour later Asst. Manager Brian came to the room with security to inform us that our party was over. 
 Our group was made up of mostly women in their early 20's, the asst. manager treated us with such disrespect it left more than a handful of my co-workers visibly upset, which seemed to amuse Brian. (I would like to add that the security staff were nothing but nice, very understanding and agreed with us that this was ridiculous.)
After, most of our coworkers had cleared out we decided to seek help from the front desk. We were repeatedly told that Brian refused to speak with us. 
Our holiday party was ruined. We spent all of our budget on the $800 it costs to stay in the Apex suite. This was a night for us to have an enjoyable time together, instead it became a disappointing experience. How can something as unreasonable and biased as this interaction happen here?! Especially when we were nothing but transparent about the fact we were hosting a party for a group. 
We believe that Brian discriminated against us based on age. 
He refused to move our suite, offer us to stay at a different property, or accommodate us in any way. All things he offered to the disgruntled room next door.

I arrived Saturday Night around Midnight. No line to check in (other reviewers claim long check in lines, this was not the case). As I was walking into the hotel lobby, I literally ran into Robin Leach!!!! How Funny! He was actually a nice guy. With a Bad Ass Chick in here 20's. He's a short ugly bastard though.

Check in was smooth only took 5 minutes, he front staff all had smiles and they were all BEYOND friendly. They provided room keys and through the gorgeous lobby to the beautiful hotel bank. I say beautiful hotel bank because the doors and walls are images of the Girls of PeepShow and Holly Madison is gorgeous. So seeing her everyday going up and down was a pleasure! 

We had a room on the 28th floor. Last room on the left with the double doors. We had a Panorama Suite and WOW was it gorgeous. Seriously my fellow YELP friends, This was the Best View in Vegas. You can argue with me but I promise you will lose. See my attached pictures. 

The room was clean, the beds were beyond comfy, great water pressure, and we always had hot water. The room had a spacious living room and a HUGE Plasma TV, but once again the views made the room. We would watch the Fountains at Bellagio day and night! There was a mini bar with a fridge and two bathrooms. The room was perfect seriously. Also they housekeeping staff were so friendly. 

The Resort itself is great. Many options to eat. Earl of Sandwich is not only great but cheap, A sandwich is $7 bucks!!! The Miracle Mile Shops were perfect. They have ABC stores and the prices of bottles of liquor and Red Bulls are compared to local spots in my neighborhood. 

I know this review is all over the place, but the Free Bottle of Liquor was a great addition it's a normal size bottle 750ML.. We chose Sky Vodka... 

The Casino is beautiful. The Heart bar is always fun, on Saturday Night they had a DJ which played really good music. The pleasure pit was a lot of fun and all the dealers were great too. 

I seriously have nothing bad to say about this Hotel Casino. The location cant be beat. 

I also wanted to point out the reason had a great trip was due to the Staff at PH. They made me feel welcome from the moment I walked in to the moment I left. They actually treated me as if I was Phamous for those 4 days.

We checked in a few minutes early, no big deal. When we were done checking in at around 3, the lobby was almost full of people waiting to check in. We got a free upgrade from a Hollywood Hip to a Resort Room which made our day.

The Resort Rooms are very nice and clean. The bathrooms are HUGE. Almost the same size as the room itself. They have a nice glass shower, sinks on opposite sides, and a nice soaking tub. We got two queen beds in each room and they were very comfortable. One of our rooms had a view of the Bellagio Fountains which was really nice to watch right from the window. Each room has a theme based on a movie which is neat. A Resort Room also has a 42"" TV (guesstimate) and two lounge chairs with a desk and chair. Room service comes around every day to clean up and replace cups, soap, etc. They'll also check your bags upon arrival and departure which is nice since we had time between both.

We went in December so we didn't venture to the pool but the pool area is quite big. The Miracle Mile Shops is a great place to walk around and get food. Nothing is exactly fine dining but still selection of bar food, sit-down restaurants, to fast food. Also Earl of Sandwich is attached to the casino floor. 24\/7 sandwiches? Amazing.

I think the best thing about Planet Hollywood is its location. It's literally center strip and you can't get much better than that. The hottest nightclubs are all within walking distance (except Palms). Marquee at The Cosmopolitan which just got rated #1 in the U.S. is just a skywalk away. The Bellagio, Caesars, CityCenter, Paris, MGM are all within 5-10 minutes walking. I can't stress how awesome the location is.

The casino floor is very nice. It gets very busy at night (the Pleasure Pit and go-go dancers bring in people I'm assuming). Tables are $10 during the day for games like blackjack and go up to $15 by night if I'm not mistaken. The Pleasure Pit is a unique twist on the casino experience I guess. The sportsbook is decent but far from the best or most extensive in Vegas. Planet Hollywood has 2 nightclubs inside, Koi and Gallery (more on those in their respective reviews).

A downside is that WiFi costs around $15 or so if I'm not mistaken. Waaaay too expensive. Luckily I have 3G on my iPhone or I would have done without being connected with the world. 

I would definitely stay here again for the location if for nothing else. It's the most affordable hotel in its location by far. The affordability definitely had the crowd skewing younger but still met a wide variety of ages. If you're looking for good nightlife in Vegas, you need to be in the center strip area and PH is the most affordable choice. I wanted to give it more of a 4.5 than a 4 or a 5 but it is definitely an excellent hotel.",2,0,1

Pros:
-What a sexy room. Reminds me of a W hotel room but better and newer. 
-The tub was dreamy. Two people fit in here very easily. 
-The bed was extremely comfortable. I slept off my hangovers without a fuss. 
-The TV was HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and had a ton of channels
-Room Service was quick and the food was decent. 
-Shopping was RIGHT there. Literally. And the stores are decent.
-There was broken glass in the elevator. I got in and out, and when I went back in the same elevator again 2 minutes later, it was gone.
-My Sig Other loved the music played in the Casino.
- The rooms were super cheap on Priceline (like 50 bucks a night for the weekend)

Cons: 
-The pool was closed. It was ok however, because it was freezing and windy.
-The amenities smell like ass. Burnt plastic, to be more accurate. 
-It was difficult to get into Prive' even though I was a guest. What a bunch of jerks.

1) They have an Earl of Sandwich, and I'm a sucker for a hot sandwich.
2) Location
3) Comfy beds

As I sit in my hotel room, counting down the minutes until I leave this god awful hotel, I felt compelled to Yelp about my experience to hopefully save you from the horror of staying here. 

1) The shower head (in a small shower stall) points so high up that unless you are 7' tall, you cannot possibly enjoy your shower. I am 5'7 and the water would only point low enough to hit the back of my head. Never mind trying to wash your body! And since the stall is so small, I had to hug the shower wall (which is exactly what everyone wants to do in a hotel bathroom that's been used by 1,000,000,000 people) to get the water to hit me at all. 

2) The hotel walls are PAPER THIN and every room has a shared door with the room next door that has a 1"" gap at the bottom. Unless your neighbors love to whisper to each other while vacationing in Vegas, you will hear EVERY WORD your neighbors say to each other.  

3) Hotel security is worthless and rude. I totally get it, it's Vegas and everyone is here to party. By 4am my neighbors were still going hard so I knocked on the door and asked if they could keep it down a bit. I was told to ""F*** OFF!"" Ok... I dial hotel security and they come to my neighbor's room (and keep in mind the thin walls) and I hear them say, ""your neighbor says you're being loud so try to wrap up the party."" REALLY?! I know they have to know I called security but do you really need to call me out like that?! Totally unprofessional. In retaliation, my neighbors sent security to my room the next day at 5am for ""a fight that had broken out."" My husband and I were dead asleep, which was obvious by our sleepiness and the dark room when my husband opened the door. I was undressed and in bed and hotel security insisted on coming in to talk to me. I yelled from the bed that I was naked but we were sleeping and everything was fine, but they insisted on coming in anyway. That wasn't uncomfortable or anything, talking to two male security guards while I was covering up with a sheet. I could hear my neighbors laughing through the wall. At this point I'm STEAMING so that night as my hotel room filled with weed smoke as my neighbors partied it up again, I called security to tell them our neighbors were using drugs next door. Their response? ""Unless we witness drug use in the public areas of our hotel we cannot enter someone's room to ask them to stop doing drugs. Plus the smell is probably just coming through your vents."" I told him I could SEE smoke coming from under the shared door, and he basically said I had to deal with it. Hotel security entered my room uninvited the night before... Was that not legit?! But they have someone complaining about weed smoke coming from next door and all of a sudden security can't enter someone's room to check it out? So any junkies looking for a quiet place to shoot up, Planet Hollywood will not enter your room to stop you! Parents traveling with small children or people not cool with cigarette or pot smoke filling your room? (YES, we were in a non-smoking room.) I recommend the Wynn or Paris, depending on your budget. 

4) Upon my arrival, there was no TV remote or room service menu in my room. When I called downstairs to ask for a remote, I was told to look for it cause ""it HAS TO be in the room."" After 30 min of searching, I found it under the bed but it was so deep that I had to army crawl under the bed to retrieve it. When I wanted room service that night and couldn't find a menu, I called room service and asked if they could just tell me the sandwiches on their menu and the guy said he ""can't remember"" so he transferred me to housekeeping to get a menu brought up... Normally this wouldn't be an issue, except for the fact that it was a busy night so I sat on hold 15 min to get him the first time and another 20 min when I called back after housekeeping brought up a menu. 

5) The toilet leaked. Every time I flushed, the handle would spray water. 

6) Housekeeping in general is pretty bad. Never mind the missing remote and menu, there were short & curlys in the tub, hair around the toilet, the glass nightstand had residual food on it, and the worst of all... The back of our toilet had a ridge that was FULL of urine. 

Please, nobody stay here. There are so many hotel options in Vegas there isn't a need to punish yourself with a stay at this hotel. There is more I would like to write about but I can't think straight due to the noise of my neighbors partying for yet ANOTHER night. *ARGH!!*",5,1,0

Each room has a movie theme. The rooms are spacious and hip. I normally get a suite facing the Bellagio Fountains and the Paris Eiffel Tower.

The hotel is showing its age and needs a renovation but it's still a great choice over the older hotels such as Harrah's or the Quad both of which have been going through renovations as well.

Parking can be a pain so save yourself the stress and use valet.

The Spices Buffet is a good choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner but it does get extremely busy.

Not too shabby. I went in expecting the fabulousness that was depicted in the Ashton Kutcher\/Cameron Diaz overacting-but-i-loved-it-anyway-fest ""What Happens in Vegas..."" and well, let's just say it was a bit of a letdown.

The rooms were OK, and granted I've been to Vegas enough times to know that the base room isn't exactly luxurious. For me though, my issues were pretty basic hotel service based. For instance -- toilet makes a loud clunking\/shuddering noise after every third time it is flushed. In one of our rooms, the shower - which had fab water pressure - required the mechanic to come up and turn it off. One blowdryer blew the bathroom fuse (which gratefully we were able to fix after a quick confab with maintenance), and the pillows were rock hard. The whole room (Judge Dredd-themed) felt like it needed a good scrub and repaint.

Also, so much of the hotel is taken up by the Miracle Mile shops, the onsite amenities seemed a little lacking. It's also a real haul through the shops from self parking to check in, so definitely deposit someone with your bags before you go stash your vehicle.

Well what can you do, decline to pay? But at least have more toiletries! When I called down to the front desk, I was on hold for a good 5 minutes(!!!) before reaching somebody (and I know they weren't even that busy) and that's not even the worst! I simply wanted some toothpaste and was told I ought go to the gift shop. WTF? My $30+ daily fee isn't enough to cover a 30 cents traveler's size toothpaste? I did go to Walgreens and get it, why would I let the hotel make money from me again?

We were placed in a room kinda close to the elevators, but they don't make much sound. There was, however, something that keeps beeping every 5 seconds and it lasted the entirety of our stay. I bet our neighbors heard it too and maybe it was reported. I saw a guy fixing the elevator but nobody came to address the beeping.

I decided to stay here because we had tickets to see Britney. The show was not bad and the stage was spectacular, but come on, Planet Hollywood, shell out some bucks to install big screens so audiences from the far sides can see the act! 

It is nice to have a Miracle Mile shopping strip right inside the hotel, but boy, that together with the casino sure makes one confusing labyrinth to navigate. Three places I saw that were interesting but didn't get to visit this time (doesn't mean I'll stay here again just to check them out though):

- Earl of Sandwich
- Netsle Tollhouse
- Todai (all you can eat sushi!)

My husband and I stayed here and everything was fantastic, which is why we choose to stay here again this past week. We checked in around 3:30pm which took a while because there was a huge line of guests waiting in line also to be checked in. I was exhausted from the plane ride, since I don't care for flying and wanted to lay down before the evenings planed activities. 
We got up to the room, walked in, and it smelled like some on had been smoking only moments previously in our requested nonsmoking room. The room was disgusting! There was half drank cocktails sitting on the night stand and all along the entertainment system and a cig still lit in an ashtray also on the night stand. Not to mention the dust all over the bathroom counter, in the bathtub, and dirty socks that I found under one of the beds. I was a little surprised I didn't find a dead prostitute between the mattress and the box spring. 
We called the front desk and they said they would change our rooms right away and send a bell boy up to move our luggage. I was pissed and disgusted, so I went downstairs and bought a drink which to my dismay cost $15.50! I sat and enjoyed people watching while I waited for my husband to call and tell me where the new room was. 20 minutes passed and I was finished with my drink, so I called to see what our new room number was. My husband told me no one had come to pick up the bags yet and they had not given us a new room yet either. I went down to the concierge and told him of our situation. He gave me staff passes to Prive' , their night club and told me we didn't have to wait in line or pay with these passes. I was happy to receive some sort of compensation for my troubles. He apologized again and immediately sent me to the first available person at the front desk since he was not able to assign me a room. 
The front desk person was not so nice however. He seemed flustered that I was asking for a different room and barely even said two words to me...none of which included I'm sorry or I apologize for the inconvenience! 
Finally we had a new room number and keys! I asked for a bell hop to help bring our luggage from one room to another. Instead of a person they gave me a cart and said ""Our bell hop is currently unavailable, but this will be OK."" I was so frustrated I just took the damn cart and went up stairs. We switched rooms and everything seemed to calm down a bit. That night we went to Prive' since we had the passes and not only did they tell us we had to wait in line like everyone else, but they were going to charge us 30 dollars for my husband and 20 dollars for me. By that time the concierge desk was closed, so I couldn't even dispute the misunderstanding. We didn't go to the club that night and to make matters worse, I went to talk to the concierge the next day (of course not the same person as the day before), and he said that if I was going to keep the passes that he was going to charge me 40 dollars for them!

Best thing about this hotel is the location. There is more to do in this section of the strip than any of the other parts.

There is a nice selection of restaurants in any price range with convenient access to the higher end restaurants in the adjacent casinos.

All the research paid off, because we had a great experience at Planet Hollywood.

After nearly nine hours of flying and layovers (we came from Buffalo), I'm glad we checked in at nearly 1 am, because every time we walked through the lobby during the day the line was insanely long. You would think in a place like Vegas they'd be more focused on getting you checked in so you have more time for gambling and other cash-burning shenanigans! Wake up Planet Hollywood!

After checking in we redeemed our voucher for our free bottle of liquor that was part of our room reservation. 1 am wasn't looking so bad after all!

The standard room we booked had a gorgeous view--especially at night--of CityCenter directly across the street, as well as the other hotels in both directions down Las Vegas Blvd. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, the AC\/heater worked great, and the bathroom was larger than average. The lighting (even in the bathroom) seemed a bit sparse, and the knob for the bathroom lighting was missing, so we had to press in the small metal rod to turn them on. However, it was ALWAYS quiet, no matter what time of day or night we were in our room, and housekeeping did a great job, as expected from an on-strip hotel.

One interesting feature was the flat screen TVs and upbeat music in the elevators. You might not think much of it, but it helps to cut into the awkward silence of going up 27 floors with strangers, pretending you haven't been out drinking all night!

The casino is nice, good sized, and the centrally-located Pleasure Pit area (look for all the pink) comes alive at night with lingerie-clad pole dancers and dealers--in case you didn't already have enough excuses to go gamble! That's also where you'll find the escalator\/entrance to their resident club, Privé. Hurry though, it might not be for much longer! They're behind on rent, possibly have multiple lawsuits to deal with, and PH has no intention of renewing Privé's lease!

Even though PH was just acquired by Harrah's, I hope they let the existing management do their own thing. They seem to pretty much have everything under control.

PRO's:
**Location:  All about the location, and this is right in the middle of the Strip.  You are able to walk out and go anywhere from here.  That's always nice.

**Casino Floor: The biggest strength of Planet Hollywood is the casino floor, as gambling here is really fun.  They had the Pleasure Pit, which has mostly female dealers in sexy corsets at the tables and occasionally dancing on stands in the middle of the table area.  I have no complaints about that... They have plenty of tables to play at, and depending on the time of day, the tables were $5-20.  They have a bunch of the standard video machines, although I didn't find too many video poker machines when I was wandering around.

**Rooms: The deluxe rooms are a good size, and are set up nicely.  The bathrooms are large, and have a separate door to the toilet, which is nice when you have a bunch of guys in the room.  Beds were OK, I have had better, but also worse.  They have a couple chairs, a small table and desk. Rooms could use some updating.

**Restaurants: They have a lot of places to eat, from Spices Buffet to the Gorden Ramsey spots you can choose from.  Pink's Hot Dogs is right outside, and you can also go the the Miracle Mile stores and find something in there as well.

CON's:
**Pool: Our room was right next to the pool entrance, which made for a lot of comings and goings during the day.  The pool is actually very small, and but the pool area is actually huge.  We were able to grab some pool real estate, but this has to be the weakest pool of all the larger hotels I have been at.  I was surprised that there seemed to be so much wasted space where they could only put in lounge chairs.  There was also a family pool, blackjack table and a cafe area where you can order food and drinks.

**Spa\/Gym: Since we were comped, we were able to use the facilities at no charge.  I came down with 5 people to use the gym, and the girl at the front desk immediately gave us the look as if we were trying to sneak in and not pay.  I told her that we had two rooms, and she said that we needed to have all our ID's, and they had to match the room names.  Seriously? We had to go back to our room to grab our ID's?

I like what Planet Hollywood has done with the Aladin since taking over. In my opinion it bigger and better than the Hard Rock Casino, at least from a casino and gaming perspective.

Only 6 craps pits available all with FIRE bets! Although I donated to this casino, I enjoyed playing here because of the friendly, young, and attractive dealers. The PH seems to be catering to the new generation of players.  If PH were part of Harrahs, I would definitely play here every time I come to Vegas! It's that good.  

I really enjoyed the gogo dancers they provide to distract the blackjack players!  Music is good.  Its like being in a dance club with gambling!

Overall, its a unique gaming experience that improves where the HRC and Hooters failed.

I tried to stay there, however the room pricing was too high for what was offered (I got a suite at Mandalay Bay for cheaper then I could have gotten a 'deluxe' room at PH). My recent experience at Planet Hollywood made me happy I found another place to stay...

Last Friday night I went to see Tool at the Theater for the Performing Arts inside Planet Hollywood.  Our tickets said the show started at 8 pm. At 8:45 I was still standing in line outside the venue. We missed the opening band completely. While the Theater of the Performing Arts is a fairly small venue (seats around 7,000), it clearly needed either an additional entrance,  more security working, or both to handle the flow of people. 

Tool is a fabulous band so we still had a great time at the show. The sound in the Theater was good, however I'd still prefer to see a show at the Pearl at the Palms any day. 

After the show we needed to catch a cab back to Mandalay Bay. Most casinos have lines of cabs waiting to pick people up and whisk them away to any destination on the Strip they want. Not Planet Hollywood. The only cabs I saw coming were cabs that were dropping people off, and there was not many of them. July nights in Vegas are still hot, and waiting 45 minutes to an hour in line to catch a cab is not pleasant.

I have had the worst hotel experience ever all due the valet service at PH. We have stayed at PH many times before and this will be the last time. We left the hotel to grab dinner at Caesars Palace and got back to PH. The line for the valet was out to the mall entrance \/ Self parking.  

My pregnant wife got out of the car and walked to the valet employee named Dave and asked him is we still had to wait in this line to valet if we are Seven Stars. My pregnant wife explained she was pregnant and that our 3 year old son had to use the restroom. She was told we had to wait in that line.  Fast forward 30 minutes we got up to the front of the line. Three exotic sports cars two Ferraris and one Lamborghini pulled up along the side and cut in front of the long line. The gentleman in the first Ferrari tipped the valet and Dave moved the cones letting the 3 cars go right in without having to wait in line. 

I asked why did those cars not have to wait in line?  I was told ask Craig as he is the supervisor. I went up to Craig and said why did they go right yo the front and not have to wait in line as I am a Seven Star and had to wait 30 minutes. Craig rudely told me he he is to busy to talk to me. I told him he needs to answer my question and this is unacceptable. Craig told me he is not going to talk to me and to piss off. Really???

I went yo the front desk and spoke to Desiree and asked for the valet manager to give me call tonight. 30 minutes later I got a call from Thomas who was very arrogant  and and completely useless and should not be in management or dealing with customers. His attitude was like he was irritated he he had to call me. The call went like this. I got a message to call you and I'm aware of the situation what do you want. Really???  I told Thomas if you are aware I would like an answer to why a Seven Star member would have to wait in line 30 minutes to valet his car and people with expensive sports cars can pull right up to the front of the line and not wait 30 minutes like the rest of the people by tipping the valet attendant. 

Wait this gets better....... Thomas says the valets did nothing wrong as those cars where at the hotel earlier and spots were saved for them. I told him what is the difference as we are guest of the hotel and just left for dinner. He goes on saying the valets saved them spots up front as they drive 300k cars. So if you drive a 300k car and tip the valet enough you are above anybody else including a Seven Star guest. 

I asked Thomas for his managers name and he refused to provide it to me as he said he is the one in charge. I asked again who is his manager as our conversation is going nowhere and Thomas would not give me his name so I said this conversation is over and hung up. 

It's so sad that the PH valet department and its management is so rude and unethical and allows the management to get away with treating its Seven Star  guest with so disrespect. I think it's time to look at another casino to play at.",11,5,0

Once parked, we made the 15 minute, very confusing, trek with our luggage to hotel check-in. Not only were there very few signs directing us on how to get to hotel check-in from the parking structure, we were faced with 2-3 uneducated employees who each pointed us in a different direction. One employee simply responded ""who knows I have only worked here a week"". 

Once arriving at hotel check-in, we were told we would be upgraded to a ""strip view"" room with a view of the Bellagio fountains, needless to say we were ecstatic as it was both mine and my boyfriends first stay at this hotel. This excitement was short lived, upon arriving to the room we found the furniture covered in what looked to be body fluid stains, poorly patched up holes in the bathroom doors, a dirty sink and tub, chipped & damaged furniture, a television without a working remote, a noisey toilet that kept running our ENTIRE stay, etc. I really could go on and on. In addition to all these, we were disappointed to learn our ""Strip View"" was out of a dirty window smaller than our television screen. I feel sorry for your guests who actually pay for this upgrade expecting a ""view"". 

We put all this past us and went down to the Miracle Mile shops for some shopping, dinner and drinks. Again, we were presented with uneducated staff who couldn't tell us where Fat Tuesdays, Victoria's Secret, or if there was a Bath and Body Works located in the mall - we were simply told ""I don't know, go find a map"". The only person who was of any assistance to us was one of the non-english speaking janitors who my boyfriend was able to communicate with in spanish and could properly direct us to Fat Tuesdays. 

Upon arriving back to our room around 6am, we were kept awake by what sounded like trucks driving over our room, we then realized that the monorail drives behind Planet Hollywood and what I am to assume to be directly above or behind our room. In addition to this, we were disgusted by the ill fitting sheet on our king size bed, which left a large piece of mattress uncovered at the foot of our bed, because of this we were forced to sleep with on top of the sheets without covers. We finally gave up and joined my family who were smart enough to stay at the South Point Hotel. We spent most of our day there getting some rest and real relaxation. We went back to our room at Planet Hollywood around 4pm on Saturday to again hear the non-stop monorail. 

We went downstairs to give shopping and dinner in the miracle mile shops another try. We went to the Cabo Wabo restaurant and received some of the WORST service I have ever experienced. Both my boyfriend and I have worked in restaurants while going through college, both of us being Corporate Trainers for well known, national restaurant chains - the service we received was UNACCEPTABLE. We had to ask for my drink 3 times because our server kept forgetting it, my boyfriend's food came out covered in cheese even though we requested it without (as he is lactose intolerant, which we told the server) and when we asked one of the hostesses where we could find the ""rain show"" she responded ""I don't know I don't work in the mall"" which was confusing to us as Cabo Wabo is listed as being located in the Miracle Mile shops. 

We gave up and went back to the room around 11pm and forced ourselves to sleep through the noise of the running toilet and monorail. We awoke at 8am the next morning almost immoble from the completely worn in bed. I travel quite a bit for work and have NEVER woken up in so much pain from a mattress. 

I am extremely disappointed in the Planet Hollywood and the Harrah's Corporation for allowing an experience like this. I have had great experiences in the past with your other hotels but am at the point where I don't feel I could ever stay at another Harrah's resort. I spent $250 on a room that I could barely spend any time in. I will NEVER stay at the Planet Hollywood again and most likely will NEVER stay at another Harrah's Corp hotel again. For an industry based on customer service and a great customer experience the Harrah's Corporation has failed! Like I state in my subject I am very disappointed and upset I spent my hard earned money on such a terrible experience.",8,1,2

Convenience - They've got a mall located same level as the casino and very convenient access to the strip. Earl's of Sandwich located in the casino, adjacent to strip entrance. 
Here's the thing about PH that would deter me from getting a room here:
Rooms have very thin walls.. you can basically hear people walking through the hallway late at night\/early mornings
Cleanliness of the bathroom is questionable.. one of our showers had black gunk on the shower head. I could see some mold forming on the tiles in the shower and there was a black spot on the floor in the bathroom.. lipstick on our bath tub
Something was up with our room and sheets when I stayed there.. I had chronic allergic reaction to the linens

We got in at 6:30 am and was happy to hear that our room was available for early check in. Our room was very clean and the bathroom is huge. Their basic rooms are about 100 square feet bigger than the other hotels like MGM or Paris so it was very comfortable.   Our room was cleaned well everyday and the toiletries were always replenished. 
The location is conveniently placed in the middle of the strip so we could go either north or south to check out the other hotels. Miracle Mile is located in the hotel and there's Walgreens on the corner, and a whole bunch of places to eat, making it more convenient to buy the things you need. 
We got coupons to the Spice a Market buffet in the hotel so we enjoyed a variety of food and desserts at a great price!  Planet Dailies is in the casino as well, where you can get all you can eat pancakes for $6:99 for breakfast.  Their menu is pretty large as well. And I loved having a Starbucks in the casino too, in case you need a quick caffeine fix before hitting a night on the town. 
In the casino, there were a variety of places to eat and drink as well, and a large number of machines to play on.  It's very upbeat because they play a lot of rock songs, and being a rocker myself, I enjoyed that atmosphere.
Whenever I go on vacation, I always have to get souvenirs and found great deals at the PH stores placed throughout the hotel. Can't go wrong with a $20 hooded jacket!
Catching taxis were a breeze too, since there's always a very fast and attentive attendant there.

Other features like PF Changs, Earl of sando, the miracle mile shops, and their location makes this place okay to stay at and deserve 5 stars.

This hotel and casino on the other hand kinda sucks. And let me say I am no prude and a young man whos used to not so great circumstances. I go to vegas and drop money to have a nice experience. The room is so dark you cant see anything, the girl at the desk could not have been any ruder and really pissed me off. 

Is there any security anywhere in this hotel at all????????\/ Black bums asking me and my girlfriend if we need any blow or if they can have a cigerette or 5 dollars. GTFOH. Not to mention no one checks your room key going up to the room so anyone who wants to go up to your floor and rob you after they see you get a hand pay can have at it. 

Ive also never seen machines so tight in any casino anywhere. But thats my bad luck, table games to, it just wasnt happening. 

Im very glad I only paid $55 a night. I will stay elsewhere unless they offer me a free room.

She helped with direct us with things to do whether it cost money or just free attractions. Gave an upgrade and the room faced the strip so we got to see the Bellagio water show ever night without the crowd. The room was actually nice and clean and the bathroom was clean as well. 

Negatives:
The only thing wrong with the room was the water pressure of the shower head, it was so powerful I felt like my skin was going to come off. Literally.  
And wtf do we pay for amenities we don't even use? We should get to pick and choose what we'd use, I never went to the pool, gym, used the wifi, or all that other crap. I mean if we're shopping and gambling that should be enough, you blood sucking monsters. 

Other than that:
A great place to stay, it has a mall in it. Lots of places to eat. If you don't want to walk too far to a liquor store there is one downstairs. Live environment and doesn't smell like butt, cause New York New York smelled horrible every time we were in there.

This Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino is located where the Aladdin used to be up until 5 years ago. I would dub the vibe as modern Hollywood chic. 
It's the best option on the strip in my opinion. 

The rooms rock your socks off...with movie memorabilia and framed movie pics, along with a 42"" screen TV, humongous tub, marble floors granite counters and we even had a partial view of the strip...all for just $63\/night via www.priceline.com. 

The desk staff were delightful, and there are so many restaurants & shops in the hotel & right outside of it, in the indoor mall. Take advantage of free wi-fi in the Starbucks next to the Extra Lounge, where you can see interviews of celebs too. 

To get a taste of a little technological advancement, view your room charges right on your TV. screen. Or just revel in the quietness that comes with the drama-free guests . 

One of my favorite advantages of staying at Planet Hollywood is the Express Checkout. You fill out the form in your room, wrap it around your room key cards, and slip them in the box in the lobby. You're done and ready to roll. No standing in line forever to checkout. If there are any charges left over, they'll bill you. Easy peasy. 


So yeah, in a nutshell: Best hotel stay, ever.",7,4,5

For the past 3 years we have stayed at Planet Hollywood for the following reasons:

1. Location - it is very central to the strip (you've got Paris to your right and Caesars down the block) and the mall that it's in (Miracle Mile Shops) has everything you might need: an ABC store, Sephora (in case you forgot your eyeliner at home or need free Wi-Fi haha). Fashion Show Mall and Crystals City Centre are about equivalent walking distance in opposite directions from Planet Hollywood so when I say central, I mean VERY central. Right down the street in front of Paris you can buy a ticket for $7 for the Express transportation train that will take you to both the South\/North end of the strip (North\/South Premium outlets) and the ticket is good for 24 hours - would definitely save you some cab fair for clubbing too

2. The ceilings in the hotel casino seem to be higher than other hotels I've stayed at (Treasure Island, PH towers) which makes for better ventilation - this is a huge plus for me because I am pretty sensitive to the smell of smoke which I know is difficult to avoid in Vegas. 

3. The rooms and suites are super clean - really cool movie memorabilia in each room. Bathrooms are great (also very clean) and the shower pressure is a 10 in my books. When I stayed at their sister hotel (PH Towers) the water pressure in the shower made me not want to shower - it was like someone standing there holding a watering pot pouring it slowly onto your head.

4. Planet Hollywood is a participating buffet in ""The Buffet of Buffets"" which is something my girlfriends and I do EVERY time we're in vegas. Spice Market buffet is a good option for breakfast or lunch, and is so conveniently located downstairs from the casino so if you go out the night before and have too good of a time and wake up hungover and lazy you just have to walk downstairs for food LOL


Planet Hollywood has been good to us and we haven't found a reason to look elsewhere.

And I'll break it down for you, as easy as possible, as to why it's great to stay here.

1. Location, location, location - It's kinda in the middle of the strip which is PERFECT. If you've been to Vegas, you know that although hotels are right next to each other, each hotel is 5+ street blocks in a regular city!

2. Shop til you drrrrrrrroooooooopppppppppp - There's all kinds of shops right in the hotel. Even the every present Hawaii staple, ABC Store, is in the hotel. 

3. Foodies must eat - My favorite wrap place, Tacone, is here =) I've Yelped about it! Pink's Hot Dog is, also, here which is perfect because it's the only place outside of LA where you can samps the infamous dog! They also have Blondies which is a great sports type bar...perfect for NBA post season (GO CAVS!!!)

This hotel is centrally placed to all of the major resorts on the strip.  It's right across the street from Bellagio.  If you are in one of the rooms facing the strip, you will have a great view of the fountain show from your room without the crowd.  
Ok, here's why I am only giving this pace 3 stars.  But actually, I would give this place just 2 stars, but don't want to deter anyone that wants to stay here.  
I'll start with the negatives.  The parking structure for guests and Miracle Mile shoppers are the same.  So if you are a guest, you will need to park in the parking structure, then lug your luggage through the mall and then through the casino floor and then take the escalator downstairs to check in.  I have to say, that this is unacceptable.  It's kind of embarrassing rolling your luggage through the mall while others are looking at you.  It's kind of ghetto in my opinion.  Once downstairs in the lobby, make sure you get in the right line.  There's 4 different lines to check in.  After checking in, I went up the South elevator to my room.  While heading to my room, I noticed all of the scuff marks on the walls and the carpets bulging up in certain areas.  You can definitely see the wear and tear at this point.  I had a king bed and the room was pretty small.  It's probably in the 300 square foot range.  Bathroom was pretty big with a shower and tub.  The one thing I did notice is that the towels are not the thick luxurious ones you normally would see in a high end resort.  The towels reminded me of a Holiday Inn towel.  I think they need to probably think about replacing the towels.  It's possible that these were once thick, but have been through the washer so many times, that it's lost some of it's fluffiness.  The shower tiles reminded me of a gym shower.  Although it might not be dirty, but the design seem to state otherwise.  
Ok, the positives.  Centrally located to the strip.  Miracle Mile for those shopaholics.  There are plenty of restaurants to choose from.  There's about 4 or so theaters\/venues.  The Tix4tonight booth is just outside if you want discounted shows\/buffets.  Pinks hotdog is just outside.  There's a CVS right around the corner.  The atmosphere of the Casino is one of the better ones I've been to.  The casino floor is not as big as the other resorts, but big enough that you don't feel enclosed and the cocktail waitresses come around very often.  The DJ is always playing great music and not to mention the Pleasure Pit where you see the hot dancers gyrating behind the dealers.  The casino creates a very lively atmosphere and makes you just want to stick around.  
One other tip, if you are a guest, I would suggest you valet your car so that you don't have to park in the Miracle Mile parking structure.",1,0,0

When we arrived, they told us they didn't have any double queens only had a king with a roll away.  Well for 4 people that wasn't going to do.  After much polite discussion we got a double queen near the elevator.  The next day, we moved to another room (higher floor, with a view).  Our second full day in our room, we left about 10 am and returned about 5 pm to discover that we were robbed.  From underwear and bras and other clothing to toothbrushes and electronics.  When we called front desk to have a toothbrush brought up they told us they didn't have any.

Location was the best thing about this hotel. Mid strip right by a bus stop and next to Walgreens. Win! We upgraded for the better strip view. So we got a higher floor and view of the Bellagio Fountains and no $20 sandwich was needed for the upgrade offers (we initially got an offer for a suite but cheaped out). It's a small enough hotel that you can get to most spots in it very fast w\/o getting lost. It has proximity to Walgreen's, you can get in\/out in 15 minutes on a good day.

There's no resort fee so fitness center, internet use, etc. will cost you more. Thankfully my room had great phone reception so I didn't need to use it.

Room itself was adequate. It was clean and the carpet has seen a vacuum this century. Enough so that I didn't freak at working out in the comfort of my hotel room. We only had housekeeping clean our room for one day, and they did a decent job. Of course, we left a $5 tip since that was the only day they cleaned our rooms maybe they take a little extra care when you do so? Bathroom was okay, although I'm bummed we were too tired to take advantage of the tub. It's pretty big and looks like it's comfy. There was no cigarette smell on our floor or in the room which was appreciated.

Our room was themed after ""Hot Shots"" so I made a few Winning! jokes the whole weekend which annoyed my husband :)
The bed was ""eh"" and I didn't realize it until I got home to my own bed. The mattress is okay but if you put any weight on it at the foot of the bed, it flew up into the air.

The have an inroom safe which I took full advantage of it's big enough to store a laptop and a few other items.  If you're staying here, sign up for the Total Rewards program. It knocks a few bucks off the 24 hour buffet coupon which works at their decent buffet and several others. You also get a few bucks knocked off at other regular restaurants.

We checked out Loberace (Cee Lo Green's show) while there and it was nice to not have to look for the theater on the bowels of the hotel way off the beaten path (as you would at most hotels in Las Vegas).

The upholstery in the lounge was torn, the elevators dirty, the furniture in the rooms missing doors and peeling off etc. you can do much better for the price range.

It took FOREVER just to get to the lobby downstairs on the elevator the day I left. It was Sunday mid-morning and I guess everyone was checking out. So I ended up having to go up and come back down one floor at a time until I finally got to the lobby. The elevators were slow the whole time I was there. 2. On busy days, expect to wait 45 minutes to get your car back from valet. It's not worth it. Just self park and save yourself the hassle.",0,0,0

The best way to describe our experience is that everything at PH happens ""the long way."" The self-parking facility is a 15-minute walk from the hotel entrance, but the line for valet parking is 30-45 minutes. You can't win. There is a great deal of paperwork to be signed at checkin, with initials or signatures on every page. The mall is an endless loop, so anytime you want to leave you have to put on your hiking boots. The ""free internet"" that comes with the room requires you to pay for it and then have it comped later - not a big deal in and of itself, but very representative of the poor planning that is rampant in this hotel.

And then there are the staff. They're extremely unhelpful. One staffer tried to tell us that room 3425 was Room 34 on the 25th floor (this is obviously wrong). Another gave me backwards directions to the dog park. Everything comes with a fee. When asked to send up some champagne flutes, the concierge wanted to charge us $8.50 just for having the glasses delivered. When pressed on the fee, the employee touted the virtues of the complementary ice that comes with the glassware. Really. A true 4-Star hotel does these things as a courtesy to its guests. 

All told, we are definitely not going back to Planet Hollywood.",0,0,0

I went down to LV for 5 nights on a girls trip and we had reserved two rooms. We had requested adjoining rooms, which for some reason they were unable to accommodate (as one of our rooms had a door to adjoin to it's neighbour (who checked out the day after we arrived). That wasn't a big deal because we were on the same floor so it was fine. 

As other reviews have said, there is often a long line when you arrive for check in, so be prepared to wait. Though as we walked the strip and checked out other hotels there also appeared to be long line ups to check in (and for cabs too!). Customer service was a bit lacking - and sometimes there representatives were just plain unhelpful - I would expect more from a town that basically runs on customer service. 

Rooms: They rooms were fine. We had reserved the standard room with 2 queen beds. Great size (especially for 3 ladies with suitcases) and the bathrooms were a good size as well with lots of counter space. There is no mini fridge or coffee maker in the rooms - those are an extra charge. WiFi is a total pain at the hotel - and only includes one device per room though we were told they are in the process of changing their policy to include 2 devices per room. 

The Pool: The pool area is fine. Can be quite busy on the weekend, but not a terribly relaxing pool area. Seems like a bit of a wasted opportunity especially when compared with other hotels. There are two small pools on either side of the area (one is 21+) and there is this massive cement area with lots of loungers set up between them. There is no shade and no landscaping to add any ambiance. If you want to lounge by the pool and relax go elsewhere. If you want to party with a bunch of frat kids you might be happy.  

Overall: I would stay at PH again if I got a great deal (our average price was ~$120 night) though would prefer to pay a bit more and stay elsewhere on the strip.",0,0,0

I had a magnificent room on the 32nd floor with a view of both pools, the Bellagio Fountain, and the strip. Awesome.  Can't say I was overly impressed with the room. The room had poor lighting and semi loud plumbing, but it was very spacious, and contemporary.  However, as a frequent traveler, I have experienced much nicer.  

I do love the convenience of having the Miracle Mile shopping mall just outside of the casino. Love splurging in French Connection, Marciano, BCBG, Bettie Page (for my eclectic side), Benetton, Urban Outfitters, White House Black Market, and Bakers or Wild Pair when they have a decent looking shoe that doesn't lack in quality or craftsmanship. PH is one of my must stops for shopping because it houses the Coffee Bean, one of my favorite chain coffee shops. While I enjoy shopping at PH, I expected more in terms of the rooms. The rates are usually fantastic, but I would rather pay a bit more for luxury. In that regard, I will likely stick with the Venetian\/Palazzo, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan (because I'm a Marriott elite snob, lol), or the Aria.

Casino is pretty nice too, especially The Pleasure Pit come night time, but for some reason, they take all my friends' money, so no one really likes to gamble here.

A resort fee of about $40 per night is charged -- which I'm not exactly sure what that covers other than Wifi (which please note: you only get to connect 2 devices per room to Wifi -- if more, you'll have to pay.)

If you want to check-in early, you'll have to pay about $22.  My boyfriend and I decided to skip on this and instead walk around the Strip to explore since our flight came in so early.

On our last day, our flight home was a red eye flight so we requested for a late check-out.  When my boyfriend called the front desk, a staff member answered and immediately told him that due to availability and occupancy, they do not offer any late check-outs.  This was absurd and unheard of, so I called back and another staff member picked up the phone and apologized and said that for $30 a late check-out of 2pm would be provided.  This mix-up or miscommunication was unnecessary and we definitely know all the rooms were NOT fully occupied because the hotel\/casino was quite empty.

Overall, customer service was bad overall.  No one was friendly and it didn't feel welcoming at all.  Everything came off just as a business transaction.

Also, there is no security for the elevators to the hotel from the casino level -- which I think is very dangerous as anyone could go up and down the elevators to the hotel rooms.

In terms of the casino, I read other reviews in that a lot of the tables could actually be rigged and the casino just wants to take your money.  And I definitely believe that.  We played the roulette tables and each time numbers would hit that weren't picked.  We lost every time.  We played at other casinos (including Bally's and Aria) and won.

We definitely won't be staying here again.  I would prefer paying a bit more and staying at Aria or the Cosmopolitan for better customer service, hotel security, and casino.",0,0,0

Planet Hollywood is young, sexy (hot girls dancing on tabletops throughout the casino) and generally a fun place to be. It also has a major convenience factor with the Miracle Mile shops on hand. The pool is even better.

The Sunday we were poolside was a chill one. No outrageous craziness, just fun, fun, fun. Cabanas were comfortable and well-attended to. I liked the pool set up, too. I didn't like that there were unattended children hanging around, in the jacuzzi, etc. I prefer adult-only pools, personally.

Even as far back as the days when Planet Hollywood use to be called Aladdin.  Actually, I was here for the big implosion of the old Aladdin and the grand opening of Miracle Mile Shops and Aladdin.  The Aladdin brand was a bit boring, I'm glad they revamped it to, what is now, Planet Hollywood.

The valet here has always been bad.  It can take forever to get your car or even drop it off.  Unless, of course, you are a Diamond or 7-Stars member.  Thank you Caesars Entertainment, formerly known as Harrah's Inc., for buying up PH.  VIP valet is super fast and very much a necessity on Fridays & Saturdays.  Speaking of which, the taxi lines on Fridays & Saturdays at PH are ridiculous.  Walk a bit to the Paris taxi stand if it looks bad unless the attire you're wearing doesn't call for such strenuous activity.  And, unless your by yourself, don't even think about parking at self-park.  No brownie points earned for saving a few bucks on tip for valet.

The rooms in PH, themselves, are pretty amazing.  It's a bit dark, but the beds are comfy and the movie memorabilia displayed around the room gives an air of nostalgia.  The decor is trendy and intimate.  PH is not really suited for families.  It's more for the twenty somethings of the world that live life at full throttle.  If your young at heart though, go for it, this casino & hotel still rocks for us older dudes and dudettes.

One thing I truly love about PH though is that they have a ""Pleasure Pit"" at night.  It's any area where your dealers wear somewhat sexy 'uniforms' and dance on an elevated stage on occasion.  If, I may quote Paris Hilton, ""That's Hot"".  Yah, I said it.  Let's get pass that now...cool...alright.

PH is also home to a damn good sandwich place called ""Earl of Sandwich"".  Yup, a sandwich place from the descendant of the Earl of Sandwich himself.  Can you say, pass the mustard?!

The feelings of youth and seizing the moment just burst in the air at PH.  Feeling young and being young isn't bad at all.  It's definitely a Top 5 stay at LV for me.",4,2,4

I am rating this hotel 5 stars based on what you are getting for what you pay.

It is in a great spot on the strip. It's even attached to a mall and inside of that mall is a small theater.  It's super convenient to go to Sephora and get your makeup done before you hit the town!  The club inside Planet Hollywood is only okay, but I love the fact that you have so many options for food (the buffet is a must eat), entertainment, and shopping connected to this hotel.  This is especially a plus if you are visiting in the winter (as I was when I stayed there a few years back).  You should check out some of the shows in that theater as they are less expensive than other places, but still highly entertaining.  I've seen the Mentalist and Vegas the show there and was happy with both of them!

Note: I had an awkward experience checking in on my visit.  I was staying in the room with two of my cousins and my male cousin and I got there first.  As we were checking in the clerk started telling us all of the things that we needed to do and told me about all of the places that I should have my boyfriend take me.  I laughed and told her that actually he is my cousin, not my boyfriend.  Her response was a big wink and she said, ""Sure, I know he's your cousin.""  That made both of us feel weird.

Nothing great, but clean and functional. It wasn't a day club, but didn't expect or want that.  But the people made it a great experience.  Alex was our cabana host and was great.  Kept our water full and towels fresh!  Nicole was our waitress and drinks were never empty and the food was very good.  Very prompt and a great personality.  We road the FlowRider and had a great time.  Good entertainment and everyone could do it,  from the kids to the adults.  It would be fun to have one of those!  Meg was very helpful and answered a ton of our stupid questions, always with a smile.  The pool manager, Mike came by and saw us throughout the day and and always seemed to remember our names!

We are always treated grate there and well respected never a issue . At the end of February I was sent out by Harley Davidson for a event at Planet Hollywood . I had to attend a bunch of early and all day functions there . So I thought it might be a good idea to stay whit planet Hollywood . I could go up and down the elevator from my room and to the function and back and forth easyer and didn't have to worrie about driving . I read the reviews and it seemed like a fine place to stay and was excited . Well from the start when we arrived I stead of having valet immediately assisting us when we pulled up we had to go and get them and ask for help and it seemed like we where bothering them . And they weren't that busy either . So while my wife delt with valet the rest of us went to the putter 40 and parked our bikes . Checked in with only 2 people checking in a HUGE check in line . Took a while . Then we got out room went in and found it in bad shape . 3 things first the bathroom drain was clogged and not draining . Being a plumber I worked on it and got it draining just ok with the little things I had with me . Second the carpet was all bunched up in the middle of the room like a speed bump and we where tripping on it the hole time there . Third one of the main lamps that produced light in the room was broken and dangling on its base. Like a tripod with lamp shad hanging on its side . 

That's the room . The stuff I was there for went fine . But while I was busy my wife and  another wife spent the day together and it seemed like every where they went every one was  RUDE to them first just tryin to call the bell desk took for ever and in the end they had to go down stairs to talk to them instead of the phone because they wouldn't anwser. Took over a day just to talk to the concert box off on how much tickets where? Then they tryed to eat at the Buffett in the hotel and where behinde a person that had been waiting at the front of the line for some time  and was passed up by the cashier because they where to busy helping the five star card members and when they where dun with one then a nother would come up and again and again and again . My wife was getting frustrated so she said something to the manger and he treated her like shit telling her that the five star people spend a lot of $ to be at that status and that they come first . Like the rest of us and our $ if no good . H he went a a far as to make fun of them , laugh at them , then called security on them to have them leave . In the end they ended up eating in the mall . 

Then Friday night yes we are only to Friday . All this happened between Thursday and Friday . 

So Friday might we had a HUGE !!!! Party in a banquet room and even there the wait staff seemed like we where bothering them and was  difficult just to even get coffee . Goan as far as to that I had to go get the pitcher of water and coffee for our table . By the way this party was for over a 1000 people no small get to gether . 

In the end I will never stay here again not even if they give ma a free room I would rather   Stay at the Venetian . The only nice thing I would say about the room was that the beds and bedding was nice . 

Good luck with your decision. That's my openion .",4,1,0

The location is GREAT. The hotel was not a maze like the other hotels and it didnt take us 30 minutes to walk out of the hotel! Theres a mall inside so if you want last minute dinner its right downstairs!

The only thing I would complain about is the casino. The staff arent friendly at the tables. I know youve been doing the same thing all night but come on... who wants to gamble with someone who is monotoned or has their eyes rolled at you. 

The interior of the hotel is so cute! It was modern and yet creative at the same time! We paid about $650 total for the Ultra Hip Room. If youre looking for something simple but not basic this is it!

I let management know, but the area was never cleaned up. I also asked the to replenish the dog bag, but it never happened.

Some of the Aladdin-ness still shines through, but not much. In fact, for a place that bills itself as, well, Hollywood in Vegas, I was kinda surprised by how not-that-tacky the place was. 

The room we got as part of a package was on the smallish side, except for the bathroom, which was oddly enormous. Beds were comfy enough but the sheets a bit scratchy. One thing I didn't care for was the always-on A\/C. My day three my San Francisco nose was practically bleeding from being so dried out.

As for the rest of the hotel, I did like how the place seems to cater to a 20-30-something crowd. Not a lot of screaming rugrats around. Also, the casino has very high ceilings, which helps to dissipate so much of the smoke you still have to tolerate.

When we arrived, the line to check in was not bad. We arrived early and we were able to check in early, for a fee, $28 I believe. We were told if we waited 1\/2 hour, the fee would only be $15, but they gave us the reduced fee without waiting because of medical reasons. They also provided a refrigerator in room free (normally $25\/day) for medical reasons, which is that I had medication that needed to be refrigerated. 

Entering the room, I noticed one bed was seriously concave, but the other one was fine. There was a lighted table that the cord had been severed and the wires exposed. We informed the bell guy when he brought our bags but we didn't care enough to change rooms. The carpet was loose, looked like water damage to me. The TV was fine, but has absolutely NO jacks, so you can't hook anything up to watch movies or music or games. They do charge for internet, $13.99\/day, PER DEVICE!!!! Good news is Starbucks and some restaurants have free WiFi. 

The bathroom was huge and very nice, but the shower was weak. The bathtub is awesome and easily fits two, but ours didn't drain. So, called maintenance. They didn't fix it the first night (GROSS!) but the second time we called, they snaked it, made mess, housekeeping came to clean, whole process took about three hours. I assume the issue was resolved, but we didn't use the tub again after that. Also, when people in other rooms shower, it is loud as hell, but I never heard the people talk or laugh or any other noises lol.

We called to speak with a manager about the plumbing issues. The girl that answered, Olivia, has a thick accent. Apparently she was saying ""manager"", but to us it sounded like she was saying ""money gift"", and when we finally figured it out we laughed about the misunderstanding. She was rude, accused my gf of laughing at her, and then hung up on her. Call back and got the GM Brian. He was a dick from the start. He offered to give us a free late check out, which we already had arranged. So, he took off the early check in fee and a room service charge, a total discount of $36. 

While speaking with Brian, we discovered that we had a charge for room service that wasn't ours. So, we called the room service manager, Pharrin. She was absolutely awesome! She immediately looked into the incorrect charge, took it off our bill, and even offered to cover our breakfast the following morning!

OK: The rooms were okay, decent size and clean. It was set up kind of awkward though with the TV on the wall next to the bed, so you could not lay in bed and see the tv if you were laying in the bed. Not a big deal, since we were not there to watch tv, but it would have made more sense to put the TV in front of the beds, like in every other hotel room I have ever stayed in. Another major problem I had with the room is that I had my beach cover up hanging on a hook in the bathroom underneath a towel and the maid took it when she took the towel when cleaning the bathroom. Probably my fault for hanging up the towel instead of throwing it on the floor, but I like to keep my towels to use more than once. I called the front desk immediately upon noticing my dress was gone but they were not willing to help me at all and directed me to lost and found. I called lost and found but of course no one answered. I ended up filling out the online form, but that got me nowhere. Again, the item wasn't lost, it was TAKEN from my room. Sure, it was an accident, but a little compensation would have been nice. I was never able to get anyone on the phone to complain about this. 

The Bad: The pool. There are 2 pools, one for adults and one for all ages (and also that wave rider thing which I have no idea who that would be for). In the middle of the 2 pools there is a large pavement which give the feeling of a parking lot filled with chairs. There is no shade at all in this particular location where the chairs are, and if you are not willing to pay for a chair next to one of the two pools, this is where you have to sit. The pools themselves are nothing fancy, just basic pools. The all ages pool was way too cold to even put our feet in (on a 90 degree day) so we left that one for the adult pool. DJ and party atmosphere there but nothing special. Again, there is nowhere to sit unless you pay for a lounge chair or a cabana. So we ended up sitting in the parking lot with no shade, which was really miserable. Don't come here if you are looking for a nice pool ambiance. There are so many way better pools on the Strip. 

Overall: Great location, but I would not stay on this hotel again based on the pool and the fact that when something personal was taken from my room, management did not do a thing to relieve the problem.",0,0,0

My sister's friend got us a comped room for two nights here so obviously we aren't gonna say no. Had a room on the 28th floor this past weekend and this is definitely not my LV hotel of choice.

The room in two words: beat up. The bed was made, there weren't any 'surprising' finds in the room when we checked in, but I could tell off the bat that PH has seen too many groups of college kids crash their hotel. The little table had paint chipping all over it, the faux velour purple chair looked like it had been used in a few porn scenes and there was a long crack in our sink. The shower ledge had been busted like someone used it as leverage for...something, the towels were cheap so not only did they feel like bleached sandpaper on your skin, it also left a crapload of lint everywhere. No bathroom exhaust fan? Dude, c'mon...what about not fogging up the mirror after a hot shower or if you laid a gnarly cable and had a hot date in the room? C'MON! Oh, and beds were not comfy at all - had a packed feeling to them (gee, from what activity I wonder?) and inconsistent compression throughout the length of the mattress. Ugh.

Other than that, casino floor is decent enough though I never play here (craps aficionados, buying numbers you'll pay vig each time you hit rather than one time upfront). From what I hear from everyone and observed passing by, the pool absolutely noshes testicles - being a big cabana\/pool person this alone is a dealbreaker. It's not much bigger than one of those inflatable pools you can buy from Toys 'R Us and there's soooo much wasted space on empty concrete. Whoever designed this pool and whoever approved its construction needs to be tied to a train track and have a litter of Corgi puppies stampede their bodies multiple times. Really PH, the pool design is unforgiveable and I've heard more than one complaint on this from friends.

I wasn't looking to get my socks blown off with my stay, but I was pretty shocked at how ugly this place has gotten over the years; age has not been kind to PH. Like the broski that's had one too many Jaegerbombs, place is just plain ol' sloppy but I'm sure if you're wasted enough you'll have wholesome fun.

First, upon arrival, in the checkin in valet area, nobody even bothered to help us. We had so much luggage and i have to get the bellman for help, they were too late, my poor hubby already got our heavy luggages on his own. 

2. Front desk- the person who checked us in doesnt seem friendly and accommodating. He placed us in a ""non-smoking room"" but unfortunately the room smells like smoke

3. We are going up to our room and reached the 15th floor. We could smell cigarette smoke everywhere. Upon arrival to the room, the room smelled like a mixture of cleaning product and cigarette smoke. I was upset because all we thought is they are putting us in a non smoking room. I complained and asked to be moved. The front desk said theres no available non smoking room that they can offer. 

I was fuming mad because i cant stand inhaling the cigarette smoke in the room so I went down to talk to the supervisor. The supervisor did not even seem apologetic and instead became defensive saying. Those rooms are non smoking room. But people can smoke in the hallway. We saw cigarette butts in the carpet and 2 ashtrays close to the elevator. 

I complained about the A\/C vent smells like cigarette smoke as well and they said they cannot do anything about it. 

I wanted to get a refund and leave. I cannot stand staying in this hotel with such bad service and rooms that smell like cigarette smoke! (Non smoking they said) with all the commotions of going back and forth and getting too upset i had bleeding so i have no choice but to calm down and stay there for a night and decided to leave the next day. 

What we found out is several customers also complained about the same issue. The hotel management was NOT apologetic and said different reasons such as vent issues etc. 

I finally get to talk to their manager named Roberto and accused my dad of videotaping him. He is so paranoid. My dad is not even on the video and just browsing over the pictures we got from the room that we are complaining about. He seemed very defensive and again NOT APOLOGETIC! 

4. Housekeeping- it took 1 hour to get our request for extra towels. We called 3-4 times! Such a slow service.

I am warning all of you. This place sucks! They give the worst service, worst experience... All they will give you is problems.

In general, the price does not equal the amenities.  Everyone knows that the PH used to be the Aladdin hotel by now, but that was eons ago...and their purple towels prove it.  Not only did it NOT go with the decor, but the towels are so far faded...it really grosses me out.

The views suck, from a majority of the hotel rooms and the heat\/air conditioner has a mind of its own.  The complimentary shampoo, conditioner, etc. are not worth the freeness, so bring your own stuff.

The 24 hour cafe is quite mediocre and in terms of food, the only other saving grace is that there is a Starbucks on the casino floor as well as easy access to the Millennium restaurants and shops.

Aside from that, I stand by my ground that the price of the hotel does not match what it has to offer anyone who stays there.",1,0,0

Other than that I wasn't impressed with the hotel. The room I stayed in was old and looked like they took the old Aladdin hotel and added a Hollywood theme to it. The only thing I liked about the room was the big bath tub. The shower had a bit of rust in it. The bathroom only had one sink. The alarm didn't have an ipod dock. The bed was for the most part comfortable but it was a bit sunk. This is supposed to be a luxury hotel and I didn't think it really was. I highly recommend the Earl of Sandwich restaurant there though.,0,0,0

Got talked into a room upgrade just so we did not have to have 2 queens and could have a king room even though that is what we reserved. We were there 5 days so that was $250 extra. The room was twice the size were were told with a better view(even though we got a premium fountain view originally anyway).

 Bathroom was huge and beautiful....if you like a bathroom without a door. I do not. The bathroom had wall of wall windows though that faced the Cosmpoilton, I loved that.  The shower was right next to the door so when our friends were in our room they had to stay near the sitting area if someone was showering or they would have seen everything.  The light to the toilet closet was connected to the other lights so to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night you either go in the dark or shine the lights directly on the bed where your partner is sleeping.  Also not good for someone like me who gets up at 6am to walk so I am getting ready in the dark as not to disturb my husband. 
     Oh and the view? It was nice enough except for the giant Britney Spears poster over your windows that look like mesh.  Your eyes will try and focus on it so you have to stand back to get your view.  After being there a while you start to notice some of the things in the hotel are very worn. Making it feel kinda dingy.  
    Had a terrible experience with a wildly rude woman in the spa and when I called to complain I am pretty sure I got the same woman using a fake voice pretending to be a manager. I am not kidding.  I had called earlier in the week from home to inquire about services and they were rude then too.  Also there is a hidden $20 service charge they tack on to all services.  The hotel says they outsource the pool, the food, the salon and can not do anything about it or comp you any of those things because they are outsourced.  Found this out because...
      Our friends also upgraded room so they could be next door to us, smelled of Marijuana so bad they could not even stay in it.  Checked in at noon, didn't get a call back from a manager till 6 pm.  Supposedly they sent someone in to get the smell out while we were at dinner. It barely worked. The next day the smell was back. Also one of their sinks did not work and they never came to fix it.  By then end we flat out told them , we really just feel like you do not care at all.  It was a mess the whole time trying to deal with Planet Hollywood.  
    Casino was great, loved it.  Drinks were good.  All the restaurants we ate in were great and the shops were so nice. There is an ABC store right in the hotel and a walgreens almost connected. Got breakfast there several times after my walk. They have a ton of food and a great liquor selection in there.  The location is perfect! No long driveway up to the lobby because of the shops.  
   Hated the pool. Not on a Vegas level. The adult pool has a DJ that we could clearly hear in our room and the chairs are $20 on that side. No idea how much the cabanas are. The all ages side was free but the pool is so basic.  Very disappointing . Not room for everyone to enjoy it either, just a big area no where near the pool with chairs.  Hard to enjoy when we could see the beautiful cosmopoliton pool across the street from our room. 

Will we stay there again? N-O! No! 

Pro's:
Resort vista room has great bathroom\/view
Location to the strip!
Great food
walgreens
casino was nice

Cons:
No bathroom door\/light situation

We got out of our car to check in, and the bell hop guy came over and told us we would take our bags and they would deliver it to our rooms after we called the number on the ticket. Well, there were 4 of us staying in 2 different rooms, so we told him we wanted 2 tickets since we wouldn't be going to the same room. He told us ""it's okay, you only need one ticket and we will deliver it to both rooms"". More on this later.

Check-in line is friggen insane. We got there around 1pm and stood in line for about an hour to get to the front.. only to have the guy tell us we were early cause check-in time was 3pm, so we could either come back later or pay $25USD to check in early. So of course we paid. 

Well, we got our rooms, and naturally, we're in the South Tower while the other two were in the North Tower. So whatever, we proceeded to go to our rooms and meet up later. So we got to our rooms and called the baggage people. Lady was rude as hell on the phone, I explained to her that the bags need to go to 2 different rooms but proceeded to cut me off and tell me that all I needed to do was to tell the bell hop when he comes up. The bell hop came and was the RUDEST PERSON EVER. I explained to him he needed to drop off the other bag at another hotel and he kept telling me he's too busy to take it over and that either I had to take it to them or they had to come to me to pick it up. HELL NO. We went back and forth with me saying, this is what the guy downstairs did, he would not give me two tickets, and he and the lady on the phone both told me that this is what was to be done for me. He really did not want to go, and kept standing there and telling me no. Wth kind of service is this? I was getting really irritated. Finally, after about 4-5 minutes of talking to his db, he finally, but reluctantly went. UGH. 

The next thing about poor service in this place is the valet. Why is this always full? When it's not full, it takes like 20-30 minutes for them to retrieve the car. And once it is full, we have to self park which is a million miles away from the hotel lobby. You basically have to walk through the entire mall to get to the hotel elevators. Pain.

The decor and stuff in this place is run down too, like everyone said - they didn't do much in terms of renos. The bathroom faucet is a genie's lamp. The hallways are dirty, with black smudge marks on the walls. The elevator doors are scratched up and banged up. The bedding and stuff is clean though, so that's a plus. I didn't get to check out the pool and stuff, so I cannot comment on that.

There are better places to stay in LV, so I definitely don't recommend staying here..",9,2,2

A couple of days after getting back from our trip, I learned that one of my friends that had stayed in the room with me had to go to the doctor and had mites.  We noticed a rash on him just before checking out of the hotel and thought nothing of it until it spread all over his body.  

I called the manager on duty to let them know of the problem and of oh course he was helping another customer and was to call me back.  12 hours later, no call.

I remember this place back when it was the Aladdin, but good ol' 9\/11 killed that bucket of fun and the hotel was converted to an LA theme (even though most of the mall is still Aladdin-themed?).

LA theme? Well, that encompasses SHOPPING, of course! The Miracle Mile mall has tons and tons of your average mall fare, with legitimate restaurants instead of a food court, and your standard shops. The two ABC stores inside definitely saved our wallets from crying at the price of Vegas booze - this Hawaiian chain sells tall cans for less than $3! In the land of $7 12oz Bud Lights... yes please! So that was a major perk to staying here.. convenient beers up until 1am!

The casino is just like any other, although I dug the decor and the music playing all over the place (including the bathroom!). Nothing like wiping your ass to AC\/DC when you're hungover at 11am! 

The room was much better than I anticipated! At such cheap prices, I was expecting a dungeon dwelling, but my boyfriend and I had a  comfortable king-size bed with a decent view of the Bellagio fountains and a large flat screen TV that was kind of at a weird angle to the bed, but I didn't come to Vegas to watch sports in my hotel when I can do that downstairs and get drunk! Everything was clean, the A\/C worked to perfection, and the bathroom was MASSIVE! Like, size of our bedroom massive! Easily fit all my girly crap on one side while my boyfriend's measly razor and toothpaste fit on the other. Big tub, shower with enough space for two people (wink!) and big, big mirrors to check yourself out in before you hit the Strip for the evening!

But perhaps the best part about staying here was the **LOCATION**. It's pretty much RIGHT in the middle of the Strip, where everything is happening, and we didn't have to cough up the money for cabs everywhere!!

They informed us there was a Britney concert just getting started so parking was worse than normal, I think he could tell we were pretty exhausted and bummed out by this (we had driven from Phoenix that day). And he let us, and other folks, drive their cars up to be parked once the concert was out. This alone was so considerate it blew me away, especially for Vegas. We were then greeted by Lisa at the front desk who was so awesome and nice!! We were checked it and made our way up to the 32nd floor where we had an amazing view of the strip and Bellagio fountain. 
We were only in town one night so we stuck in the hotel. Had dinner at Burgr and a little black jack. The go go dancers were a bit much and the drinks were wayyyy too expensive considering the guy pouring looked away as he made the drinks like he didn't mind charging $13 for a sloppy plastic cup vodka soda.

Free Pet Stay Rooms for 3 nights - Win win
Pet accomodations - (where you can walk the pooch) - not so great.

Hotel wise, its an improvement over Flamingo where we stayed at last summer for a family visit to Vegas.  The accomodations are fine but thinking it was adults only (not), the hotel was busy for the holidays (we were there Dec 24-26).  

Valet parking and getting to the parking area is easier than Flamingo which has its entrance from the Strip.  

The room itself is pretty big but nonsensical.  First and foremost, we were at the 8th flr (the 6th flr was where the pool was).  If this was a regular summer evening, you would not be able to fall asleep as it is close to the pool.  Luckily it was quiet and calm on this visit.  The size of the room is great but the configuration was all wrong.  You enter through the foyer area (sizable), to your right is the bathroom with two opposing sinks, a bathtub by the wall between the shower area and the toilet in a room.  There needed to be at least a small bench inside this bathroom.

The bedroom has decor to commemorate one of those old tv shows, in our case Moonlighting with Cybil Sheperd and Bruce Willis.  Both their blazers were displayed in a table and in a frame on the wall.  Otherwise, the bed King size is typical hotel.  The TV is on the right side of the bed which is hard to see if you are laying on bed. The entertainment center contains the drawers for your clothes and a small area for hanging clothes.  I don't think it would have been sufficient if two ladies were sharing this room.  The ironing board was also on this closet.  If you need a fridge, you need to order one for you room at an extra charge.

Since this was a comp room, I will not argue the different costs additional that you might experience including the aforementioned fridge, internet access.  I do feel that Housekeeping is overwhelmed and a bit hard to get things from.  We requested 2 luggage racks (one was in the room) so that we can set our baggage on top of it instead of placing them in the drawers.  Only one came and only after almost a day waiting.  We requested extra pillows but was told that only one person was registered therefore we were not entitled to more.  We were told that if you have the sign that you have a dog, housekeeping will not enter yet we found them in our room after returning from the fitness center.  Luckily we always leave the dog in his kennel when we leave the room (for his own safety and keeping him away from damaging anything).  

Fitness center - ah..we seem to always luck out that the sauna which we were willing to pay to get into, is always broken in hotels we visit.  It must be the low end of the season (or we are staying in average hotels).

Casino wise - as mentioned before I made out with good games and did not lose any money.  The atmosphere is alright especially since the hotel is connected to the Miracle Mile of shops (sort of a mall with standard shops and food court and restaurants).  They have the Pleasure Pit which shows women scantily clad dealing the games.  Wasted on me of course but it was still entertaining.

Overall, I would say 3.5 stars but had to round it to 4 stars for the free accomodations (I still had to pay for the pet fee for the stay).",1,0,2

Other than that, I felt unwelcome and non-existant\/marginal the entire week I stayed there. My room looked nothing like the pictures, and the housekeeping staff always cleaned my room but NEVER my bed... it was always left untouched? I even told them after the first time, yet still my bed was never made. I hate to sound like a kid, but it is an amenity I am paying for, right?

Anyways, I asked for a rollaway bed, as well as a refrigerator and was happily willing to pay the fees, and neither were delivered even after telling the housekeeping staff and calling the operator through the phone. I gave up after that and didn't bother.

The 'pleasure pit' is a joke, and I could never find any decent 3:2 blackjack tables with a decent min. bet. I couldn't find any peripheral tables with better rules regardless of time of day, and I only found one decent dealer who actually seemed happy, and entertaining. I don't understand why you would hire people that behave the opposite. Why would i want to gamble and spend my money on a table with boring dealers? I just don't get it. Every other casino I gambled at had its fair share of lame dealers and quality dealers. at PH though... it sucked.

The frontdesk girl, who I think was named Sarah, did a good job checking me in and out, it was the only time I actually felt welcomed there. Unfortunately I did not see her again at the fronk desk during my stay to try and assist me with my needs.

I just feel like I could have had a much better experience at PH- it looks decent inside but the substance just wasn't there.Is it because im 25 years old and am just not a target demographic? I make over six figures and would have loved to spend more money there in exchange for a better experience. I found myself leaving PH and exploring other casinos and restaurants after the 2nd day.

The convention area seemed okay, nothing special. I don't think I will recommend my company to be hosted by PH again this year, which is sad because we love Wyndham and it's partners(PH) and would love to have a go-to place every year without the hassle of exploring other options.

For the same price, I feel like there are better casinos on the strip and unfortunately cannot recommend this casino right now. I wish someone from PH would reason with me, but it was pretty obvious that I don't matter to them, which is sad because I work in hospitality here in Hawaii and we take pride in going above and beyond for EVERY single guest.",2,0,0

Surely I don't go on vacation to spend my time at the mall, but it was a definite plus to have one there in case I did need something, which I did. 

The club at Planet Hollywood was a bit rundown. The night I went, ladies had free drinks and no cover, but the guys had to pay $20. Once my group went inside, the club was empty. The music was good but the vibe of the club wasn't fun. It felt more lounge-y than anything else. 

Aside from the club, everything the hotel offered met my needs, except two things: 1) no fridge in the room 2) the extra security lock on the door was just for show and did not work. I stood in front of the door and watched room service come right on in with that extra lock on. Gladly, I realized this on checkout date.

Everything got resolved and we got into our rooms in minutes.  The rooms were pretty nice, I got the Dallas room with JR. Ewing's boots in it-I loved it!
The bathroom had a big tub that I took a swim in that was just awesome!  The bed had big nice fluffy pillows and very comfy overall.  
The casino was nice and had lots of restaurants and the miracle mile of shopping, I was very happy!  We ate at Koi, the sandwich place and the cafe which were all pretty good but I honestly don't think I'd eat at these places again.
Wasn't a fan of the bar area, it was always packed which I don't mind but when they have half of it roped off with no one in the area, it just doesn't make sense (and it was 5 o'clock in the afternoon!).",1,0,1

If you self-park, you have to walk in a huge circle through the mall to get to the hotel check in.  And then same thing every day if you are leaving the strip...there's always a 20 minute walk after you park to get back to your room.  Of course you could valet, but there's always a pretty big line of cars using valet, so we never used valet.

The room was fine, we got room 5050 which was considered penthouse, but our view was not facing the strip, so we got a good view of our parking garage.  

The bathtub is huge and comfortable, but the plumbing for the toilet was really weak.  Maybe we were too high up and couldn't get enough pressure.  :p  

I'd say the rooms were outdated and in need of a a re-do, but our floor was nice and quiet, and  the beds were super comfy and so as a result, I slept very well.  Our room theme was Major League and there was a pair of Charlie Sheen's running shoes in a table, and a t-shirt from the movie hanging on the wall.  A nice touch and subtle reminder that we were at Planet Hollywood.  

There are so many great hotels on the strip, I don't think there's enough of a draw for me to return.  Having said this, we had a comfortable stay, it was just the parking situation that always made me sulk at the end of a very long day.  

ALSO-there is a resort charge of $35.00 something a day which includes Wi-fi for 2 devices only.  We made the mistake of using 3 devices and got charged an additional $10.95 for Wi-fi.",1,1,1

So, I came from NY NY which was pretty great. Got to Planet Hollywood expecting the same. 

The room has inadequate lighting to start off with. Why so dark?  Then I realized why they want it so dark... The rooms are old and dirty. 

The laptop charger and Ethernet station is broken. Not cool. The light switches are so filthy I use a hand towel to touch them. There is hair in the shower for 2 days now. So housekeeping is apparently wicked awesome. There are no doors on the armoire but the hardware is still there. 

As a bonus, the walls are paper thin so you can hear a fart from 4 doors down and ""memorabilia"" in the rooms do nothing but take up space and look silly. 

Oh, and when I checked in, a fella was showing the manager bug bites on his neck. 

Other that that, it's awesome. 

No need to go to the pool to listen to the horrible music, you can hear it from the 15th floor all day.

I made reservations weeks in advanced.  Got there and they told me check in was at 3.  Ok, no problem.  Came back at 3 to find a long line.  \/sigh.  Waiting in line till after 4 and the front desk told me that my room won't be ready for at about another hour.  She gave me a room number, made a call, then told me that there is a lady in that room cleaning.  Ok, no big deal.  I went over to the ABC store and picked me up two Asahis.  Came back around 5:15 to wait in line again. \/sigh.  Now the story changed.  They said that I can get a room right now if I settled for a smoking room or double bed.  I made reservations weeks ago for king bed, non-smoking.  They would not be able to provide that for me till after 7pm!  what the shit!  what is wrong with you people?

The front desk told me that my reservations doesn't give any priority to me.  If someone without a reservation walks up and requests a room before you (with a reservation) gets there, then the room goes to them.  What a retarded way to do business.

It's true, the rooms are quite dark.  The bathrooms, however, are huge!  With two sinks, both of us had our own pampering and make up station.  The shower stall was large for a shower stall but I prefer a bathtub shower combination.  And they offer you 500 SPG points if you refuse room service.  I like the bathrobes and the 3 bottles of water free per night.  Except the crappy part is that if you refuse room service you don't get your water bottles or shampoo or lotion.  

I do find it convenient that the Miracle Mile shops are right there.  The hotel is also conveniently located on the strip.  For that reason, I would totally stay here again.  

The casino is pretty stylish compared to the others on the strip.  They had a good amount of food places . My favorite this about this hotel was that the premier experience rooms had an iPod dock for an alarm clock and that made it so much more fun.

I'm no high roller by any means, but it just goes to show you that Vegas hotels these days are really trying hard to win your business. They just merged their ""A-List"" rewards system with the bigger Total Rewards.

Overall, not a bad stay. Since the rooms were complimentary, I tried asking the front desk lady into giving us upgraded rooms with a Bellagio fountain view. No luck, she was all business. $50 extra per night. No thanks, we'll use that money on food and gambling. 

I had stayed here when it was ""Aladdin,"" but this was the first time under the Planet Hollywood name. With free rooms, I expected they were going to shove us in some crappy room by the elevators or ice machine. Surprisingly, it was very nice, quiet, and spacious. 

Our room had the ""Universal Soldier"" theme. I heard of the movie, but never seen it. I guess if you're a die-hard fan, you'd just about wet your pants staying in this room. There's actual props and movie stills from the movie hanging all over the walls, even incorporated in the furniture. I don't know about anyone else, but I don't want to be staring at Jean Claude Van Damme when I'm in the bathroom dropping the Cosbies in the pool.

One other thing to note, their valet service is insanely slow. It took an average of about 20-30 minutes each time for the car to arrive.

We stayed here for Halloween weekend and boy was that a mistake! We booked last minute so it was hard to find good deals on hotels. Luckily, we found Planet Hollywood, which was cheaper than most hotels. I wondered why it was so cheap compared to the rest and I later found out why. We've been to Planet Hollywood, walked around the miracle mile shops and have even stayed at our friends' hotel tower suite. Since we liked what we've seen so far, we thought, ""Hey it can't be that bad"". Boy was I wrong. When we booked the room, I specifically asked for a non-smoking one king bedroom. They failed to reserve me that room and said all their non-smoking rooms are all booked and that they only had a 2 queen non-smoking room available. I was a little irritated because they gave away my reserved room. Anyways, as soon as we went up the elevator to our floor (8th floor), I knew already that this was going to be a dirty hotel. There was trash on the counter right when we got out the elevator, stained carpet, stained walls, and white powder-like stuff on the floor. I was scared to find out how our room would look. So we finally got to our room and as soon I turned the light switch on, there was a two second pause until the light started flickering. It had a little eerie feel to it like a haunted house. Then I took a closer look at the actual light on the ceiling and the light cover was halfway falling off covered in old dust! I was shocked to see how someone could've missed this. I then walked into the bathroom and turned on both switch (light and ventilator). In no surprise, the vent wasn't working. I took a closer look at the vent and I was DISGUSTED. The vent was concealed in what looked like an avalanche of dust. It was FILTHY! I opened up the shower area and the shower tile floor was old a dirty with dark stained lines in between the tiles. Then I looked up at the wall and noticed pubic hair! Gross! I thought it was a small crack at first, sothen we washed it off with water to check if it was pubic hair or a small crack and sure enough it came off! Grossed out yet? Yep, I was ready to vomit at this point. I then went to the little toilet room, tried to close the door and it wouldn't close all the way. Oh but why, you might ask...the door latch was missing! I looked at the walls and noticed mold growing through the wallpaper...ugh. I was done in the bathroom so I went to the bedroom. The bedroom looked ok. Old movie props displayed as decorations. No mini fridge and a very tiny window overlooking the roof of the parking lot, I believe. Awesome, right? So on to the bed...my boyfriend slept shirtless for the first two days and started noticing small bug bites allover the trunk of his body and his back!! Omg... I don't even want to know what little creatures were crawling on the bed. So after that, he started wearing long sleeved shirts to sleep. 

We didn't bother trying to get another room because well...we were already so tired and lazy. We didn't want to have to lug all our stuff down the lobby and wait in line just to tell us that they have no other non-smoking rooms available. Whatever. So, it was checkout time. I had my boyfriend call concierge prior, just to check my balance. My balance seemed a bit high so I had them tell me what my charges were. Everything seemed right EXCEPT for the internet charges. Prior to connecting to wi-fi, I called the front desk and asked how to connect to their wi-fi and if it was free. She said, ""Yes it's free as long as you pay your resort fee"". I asked the concierge why I'm being charged $13.99 three times. She told me it was because I logged in to wi-fi using three different devices. I argued that no one informed me about this so why should I pay for it. She started giving me an attitude and said she'd take one charge away as complimentary. I kept arguing that I'm not going to pay for the two other wi-fi charges and she continued to give me attitude, which got me furious. I got really irritated and started to voice out how sneaky these extra wi-fi charges are. The man at the front desk didn't inform me, the lady on the phone didn't inform me, nor did the little packet that we get upon checking in inform me of this sneaky little additional fee. Additional charges for logging on to different devices is bull****. 

People, please don't stay in this crappy, sneaky, and dirty hotel. It may be convenient because the shops are just downstairs, but if you're looking for a comfortable, clean and descent hotel, STAY AWAY FROM PLANET HOLLYWOOD. You can bet that we'll NEVER EVER be staying here again.

Oh and to prove that I wasn't lying about the room, I took a few pictures. Enjoy!

When they transferred me it was a dead line. NOT COOL!! called the front desk back, waited again, this time the took my phone number and said they would call me back. When they did call me back they just said that the charge was valid and that they could do nothing about it. I explained that i had signed nothing stating that there would be any charge to my room above the $200 credit on the room. I also explained that our room was never cleaned on Saturday. I was again advised that someone would call me back. They did call me back and state that they would refund another party of our group to ""make it right"".

The restaurants on site were decent, Earl of Sandwich is always a good play, Yolos was good, but boring.

 We arrive to check in and that took us standing an hour & a half in line before we said screw this were not gonna miss our show. We stepped out of the line and decided to leave our luggage at the concierge. 
Hours later, We finally checked into the hotel and were given a crappy room that was 2 queens not 1 king like we had asked. There was a seat that had suspicious white stain on the arm.  The restroom was horrible, we had dirty towels, a running toilet bowl, the water in the shower did not drain and the mirror in front of the restroom was broken. 
So ofcourse I call the front desk and was told they could not do anything for the night everything was booked up. I told them to please have the manager call me so I can speak to them personally. I was told he would give me a call later. 
So next day rolls around and was moved to a better room with a better view, which was very nice. Again I asked if I can talk to the manager and was told he was in a meeting. 
Now we go to check out and I asked one last time to talk to the manager and again he was in a meeting. So we left a negative comment card and ask for them to contact us so we can share our bad experience...

I had to park in the parking garage which is extremely far from checkin. Valet lot was always full. Crazy. I was told this hotel was updated but so not the case. Holes in the walls, my bed creakes. The toilet was constantly running. The lights in the bathroom went out. The blind was broken, no mini fridge, poor lighting, completely outdated. The pool area was nice. Seth the security guard up there was really cool. Cabana rental was over priced. I was told I could choose which ever beer I wanted that came with it. So I rented it and the waitress then tells me no it had to be this particular Ale from San Francisco. Worst tasting beer ever. They should be embarrassed to serve it. I will never return.",0,0,0

The room is comfortable but not overly spacious.  When I first checked in, they put me in a ""smoking"" room that stunk to high heaven - after a day I got a non-smoking room.  The large flat screen TV was a nice touch.
The reservation staff was pleasant but not in much of a hurry - lines at the reservation desk is the norm.  The location of the hotel is good and it was very convenient to be right next to the Miracle Mile mall - which made for a much more reasonable breakfast and lunch as the hotel eateries are greatly overpriced.
Overall, nothing memorable with the hotel's proximity to the Miracle Mile mall its best feature.",0,0,0

Went to Las Vegas this past weekend and we checked into the Planet Hollywood the first night. Upon check in the reservation attendant said he would give us a room with a view of the Bellagio Fountain. Great we thought. So we went up to our room and when we walked in we were hit smack in the face with this over smell of disinfectant. So we called the front desk and they moved us to another room (better view) but the air conditioning wasn't working. Now if you have ever been to Las Vegas in June you know the how extremely hot it gets. They sent up a maintenance tech and he said to us ""Good Luck"". 
That was it. We tried calling the front desk again to be moved and they told us that according to their computers our room says it was 50 degrees. They were all smoking crack by that time! My first clue about this hotel was our ride up the elevator when two other guests came in drunk slurring their words and trying to pick up one of the other patrons in the elevator. The service there is non existent and rude. I will never stay in this hotel ever again or recommend it to anyone I know or don't know.

Our room was on the 7th floor it was a dark room little light came through. We didn't plan on being in the room often enough to care.  If you plan on room lounging I would recommend asking for a strip view or something, we could only see roof tops and little sunlight. 

On our second night I was looking for my shoes, I thought shoot maybe they are under the bed. I lift up the sham and see this red nobbed thing in the distance. I used a plastic sack to pull it out... 

It was a DILDO of some sort! Yup I found that under my bed. I thought about dropping it off to lost n found for kicks ;). I will admit I was grossed out and questioned the cleanliness of the room. Then I remembered that when we first got in our room smelled like bleach and other cleaning supplies, everything was dusted... So I'm guessing the maid forgot to look under the bed.  It happens. It's a freaking hotel for crying out loud, and it's in Vegas of all places. I go into any hotel assuming that the bed I am about to sleep on has been broken in many many times before. Just give me clean bedding and I'm fine. 

I wish they had more 5-10 tables in PH. I would probably still loose a lot of $ but at least I can enjoy loosing it slowly ;) 

The room service was way expensive after gratuity and stuff. But.... At least my dish the chicken Cesar wrap was delicious. The pizza was too greasy but I didn't order enough room service to really judge consistency good or bad. 

The buffet Asian spice market or whatever it's called was  a fail for us, but you might like it.

Pros: 

1. In the middle of the strip.....awesome location at the center of the strip. Very convenient location to and from the hotel. 
2. Rooms are very clean and fun. The rooms are decorated with a movie theme and memorabilia. We stayed in a room with the the pool and street view and from our room we were able to see the Bellagio Hotel Water Show! 
3. Many shops and restaurants to venture. 
4. Casino is huge and I guess for those who enjoy watching a free poll dance by beautiful ladies then try the pleasure pit area to gamble late at night. You can't miss. 

Cons: 
1. The walk from the parking lot to the check in is long, plus there isn't enough directions guiding you. You walk through the miracle mile shopping and into the casino and I believe a ride down the escalator to check in. 
2. Hotel is circular inside and you can get lost inside because once again there isn't enough signs directing you. If there are signs it isn't visible enough. This hotels needs more signs and maps. 
3. If you have small kids the whole pleasure pit stuff wouldn't be educational or necessary for kid's viewing eyes so be aware when traveling with kids. 

Overall it's a nice places to stay in once you figure out how to get around the circular pattern of the hotel. Plus if you are a starwoods member it's a plus, like me!",1,0,1

I've stayed at plenty of hotels in Vegas before and at one point lived in the city so I like to think I have an idea of what I'm talking about. That being said this was one of the best hotel experiences I've had in a while. Check in took about 3 or 4 minutes and there was no wait. Check out took about 30 seconds from the in room TV. The actual room was very large and the bed was comfortable. Bathroom was just as big as the room and super clean. Price was very reasonable and the room service was quick. But most of all it was extremely quiet in the room and in the adjacent hall. I was on the 25th floor in the South Tower and it was very peaceful late at night and in the AM. For the combination of value, location, and overall vibe  I plan on staying here again on my next trip.

Just a note on the casino, the place is a good spot for 20s\/30s crowd. Good vibe and lots of bars. Limits are also reasonable on a Saturday night. You can find a $25min BJ table no problem.

The only con I could say was that valet was full when I showed up to check in, even for hotel guests. There was a big concert @ the hotel that night so it's understandable. Self park was a bit of a walk through the PH mall but if that's the only issue then I really can't complain.",0,1,0

We arrived super early for Vegas- at 10 a.m., and the desk clerk was happy to check us in early.  We had requested a non-smoking room, they only had smoking available that early.  We decided to just take it as opposed to waiting for hours for another room, and were surprised at the fact that you could not even smell the smoke in the room.  Good cleaning job!!!

The resort is nice...a bit chaotic from the outside due to all the construction going on around that block (I think there must be about 4 hotels immediately surrounding this place under construction), but it's still a nice place.

The pool area is nice.  There were only a few cushioned chaize lounges spread out throughout the sun deck, they could use a few more of those, but I really enjoyed the DJ and ""Shot Bar"" right there in the middle of the deck.  Got some good sun!

The ladies working the steak restaurant upstairs from the casino are kind of rude--we didn't have a reservation and got a snotty attitude from them when asked if we could be seated in the nearly empty restaurant anyway...didn't like the attitude, so we left.

The buffett's waitress was super nice--liked her a lot.  However, the buffett itself (well, like most buffett's...) kind of left me feeling icky.  I'll never learn.

Ours did not close all the way, luckily my boyfriend was able to stack some magazines from the room to shut out the wind passing through.

On our check out day we asked for a possible late check out and they offered an extra hour. At check out 11:30 pm on a Saturday the line was very long. However they have check in\/check out kiosks I missed a few days prior. I slipped my room keys in there, entered my email address and done!

He could only take hotel guests but he could park our car upfront for $20. He gave us the receipt and we paid the $20 plus a big tip because we thought he was doing us a favor. So we went to the concert and after when it was time for us to retrieve our car the cashier asked for an additional $13 dollars. And we explained that the valet who took our car initially said the fee would only be $20 to park upfront. He never mentioned we would have to pay an additional fee. At the counter we saw multiple guests saying the exact same thing, describing the same guy and situation as us. We asked to speak to the manager and again we all explained the situation and basically we were told that the valet had left for the day and that he must have misinformed us. The manager said he wasn't able to comp our parking. So we ended up having to pay the fee of $13 because if not we wouldn't be able to get our car back.

The first thing I do when when trying a new hotel is I walk into my room and see if anything about it stands out as unique, creative, and adds a little something extra to my stay. These rooms were the basic, so not huge, no sofa, or whirlpool, but it did have some cool movie memorabilia theme to it. Our room had a display frame on the wall which held the large prop gun used on the set of Cutthroat Island (1995). The end table had a glass top and some red pants in it. haha Guessing also from the movie or that's just weird.

There's an extra mirror outside the bathroom, but the lighting in the hallway was too dark to apply any make up there if you're with a group of girls. 

The gaming area of the casino doesn't hold very many tables to play.

I had never been to Vegas and he had been about 10 years ago. The hotel room (King, 5 piece bath) was simply ok. It was the little things that caused me to take stars away. Tile in the shower was poorly maintained and showing mold and separating from the wall around the door (only visible when you are standing in the shower). Tile also separating around the tub (only visible when you are in the tub). The room was dusty... glasses had a layer of dust on them. There was just a general lack of maintenance to the room. If they don't tend to the visible stuff... what else are they not cleaning? I don't know if it's standard for strip hotels to not have mini-fridges... but this one does not. Really inconvenient to not have a little fridge for storing quick breakfast items and water. 

We used the Hotel's concierge for general information (public transportation info, directions, etc) and they were helpful. 

I would not recommend the Hertz desk at Planet Hollywood (I'll post a separate review for them). The Nissan Altima (normally a car we do not mind renting) was a total POS. It was fine for the 9 hours we rented it... but really. I expect to have at least a washed car and one that doesn't have body damage would be a bonus! 

The casino is what you would expect from a strip location. Fun, loud and we managed to take some of the Casino's money home.

Venue - In the middle of the Las Vegas strip. The panorama windows have a complete view of the strip. 

Room - It's designed well but not well kept. 

Here are some of the challenges I saw:

- Dusty...my friend smacked the sofa and a huge dust cloud flew into the air
- Cigarette burns on the furniture
- Furniture was falling apart
- Small main shower 

Service - The staff was helpful when we asked for help. 

Other notes - Definitely has a younger vibe with respects to the people. 

The room would be great if the cleanliness was maintained. I would book a different suite at a different hotel & casino due to the room cleanliness.",1,0,0

I tried for the next two days to get a hold of the manager and he is always ""in meetings"".

I later looked up the original pricing and it was the same as the price he sold us the tickets at. Oh yeah, and the Ultimate Variety Show is the biggest waste of money... it SUCKS. I think I can find people on the streets that would excite me more than their own performers. The funny part is that I never thought Chris fooled us until after we saw the show, I thought, ""there is no way that a show that is so below average would cost that much."" So I did my own research only to find out he robbed us. Anyway, Planet Hollywood is filled with thieves who don't care and just want your money.

I had the luxury of being able to attend the Night Ranger\/Journey concert here last week. It was my first time attending the venue since the rebuilt hotel\/casino made the transition from being the Aladdin to becoming the Planet Hollywood.

I want to start by saying that this is a very fine venue. Not exactly what I would call upscale, but because of the way things are set up, even the ""far back"" seats aren't too bad. You should have no problem being able to actually see the show regardless of where your seats are.

What pisses me off though is that I dealt with a rude staff member. When Night Ranger finished their set, I took my LP down towards the stage hoping I could get it signed. An extremely rude woman usher (she was heavy set, older, and had curly hair) would not let me though. The band was DONE PLAYING and LEAVING THE STAGE. I asked if I could get through really quick, just to get an autograph and then go back to my stage, and she just kept yelling the word ""NO."" What a cunt! 

If anyone in Planet Hollywood's administration is reading, please fire this bitch. This behavior would have been acceptable if the band was still playing or if I was going to STAY down there with no ticket, but she cost me an autograph opportunity - and as much as I don't like to be morbid, it is imperative that I get as many autographs while I still can, as you never know when classic rock\/metal stars are going to fall over dead. This rude behavior is no way to treat the founder of the Vegas Valley Classic Rock Society, who is dedicated to keeping classic rock\/metal alive.

All right, enough of my rant. The venue itself is very nice aside from that bitch I dealt with. If you're going to see a concert here, you'll be pleased with the quality of the venue - just be forewarned that it is not ""autograph friendly.",0,0,0

There were about 10 chairs around the pool available that you didn't have to pay to reserve. The pool is small L shape. In order to lay out without paying you were between the pools approximately 50feet away. The concrete flooring had food that had not been cleaned all over. So you felt gross walking barefoot. They have a surfing center which is fun but again you pay to play. The spa is old and they skimp in what they offer you despite high spa prices. We paid over $400 for a $50 minute couples massage. They used styrofoam cups to offer you tea in the waiting area and the seats to wait in were old and dirty. The fitness center is a decent size with lots of cybex style machines. Very small free weight area. And no perks in the gym. And it smelled like smoke. Again the staff at this hotel are nice but for all the money the casino makes they could upgrade it substantially!

Most of the dealers have fun personalities, stay away from one named Dakota.  She seems like a seasoned bored pro that seems entitled to a cynical attitude toward guests.  She is more interested in dealing as fast as she can vs making it enjoyable for the gamblers. I always get up and leave when she rotates to my table.  But most are very fun and make your table experience enjoyable.  We decided to give the hotel a try and were relatively pleased by our experience.  The rooms are not huge but clean and comfortable.  The standard bathroom is huge and has both a tub(useless for me but to each his own) and a shower. Also, the shower\/sink area is separate from the toilet area.  This is a HUGE + for anyone who has visited Vegas margaritas and food.  There is now a resort fee but it is $20 per night per room not person.  So a three day stay will cost you an extra 65 bucks.  Now standard for the strip.  I wish they would just include this in the cost, why do they make us add it on ourselves???

We found a deal on the internet that let us book for a reasonable price, especially for a weekend in June, so we were happy.  Upon arrival, they let you valet your car (free of charge, just tip them) and the hotel check in area is right inside the main doors.  The hotel staff (in my experiences) was very friendly and knowledgeable, not to mention QUICK! I stayed at the Monte Carlo and we waited for about half an hour to check in.  Pretty ridiculous.  

Our room was located on the 20th floor, close to the elevator.  Which I LOVED! No walking down long hallways to get to the room, and it was close to the ice machine.  We decided to get a non-smoking room, and unlike other people who have commented on this... our room DID NOT smell like smoke at all.  We had no noise problems either.  The elevators are fast, and they even have a little TV in there to keep you entertained while you're taken to your floor.  Housekeeping comes MIGHTY EARLY, though.  They got to our room about 9 in the morning, and umm, we had gotten in around 4-4:30.  We told them to come back later.  BEDS ARE SO COMFORTABLE! I was pleasantly surprised and didn't wake up in the middle of the night to an angry back.  Each room is themed - we stayed in the Little Buddha room.  It had a couple of posters framed and a little article from the movie on the table by the window.  Bathroom was amazingly big - which came in handy with 4 girls in the room.  Tub is huge, toilet has it's own door, shower is separate as well.  The mirror and the sink are fairly large, and there's also a mirror right outside the bathroom.  These all came in handy when getting ready for the clubs. 

I can't make any comments about the casino, since I didn't really gamble at all while I was here.  It was a birthday party, so we went to clubs\/bars.  Heart Bar, located inside the casino, is very expensive.  Bartenders aren't exactly the friendliest, but the girls dancing make it entertaining.  Halo Bar, located right outside the casino, has an awesome happy hour from 3-7 with $5 shots and $5 ""well drinks.""  

The shops surrounding the casino and hotel are awesome and very convenient - they have plenty of stores and plenty of places to eat as well.  They kept the decor from the Aladdin, but I don't mind. I'm not going to be a snob about the way the place looks.  A hotel is a place to sleep and get ready, and that's just what I did.  Earl of Sandwich is open 24 hours... but be aware when going in the middle of the night, there's lots of guys trying to pick up on you.  Creepers never sleep, I guess.  

Check out was a breeze, but valet does take about 10-15 minutes.  We weren't in a rush, and we were dead tired, so we didn't complain much about that.  If you're planning on getting a taxi while here, the line moves fairly fast. Just be prepared to pay those extra few dollars when waiting to get in and out of the taxi line. They start that timer riiiiight away. All in all? Good trip to Las Vegas. I want to try some other hotels, but I'd come back if the deal was right.",2,2,1

Not as over the top as the other hotels, but it was clean, the beds were comfortable and I would recommend this hotel to someone not looking to spend too much on a Vegas hotel.

Good:
-Location on the middle of the strip was great.
-You could walk right into the mall from your room
-Tons of stores within walking distance
-Room service cleaned the suite well, no problems
-Our rooms were spread out throughout the floor initially but we were able to upgrade to the Boulevard Suite
-Grab a late night sandwich or early morning coffee nearby
-Register for a Total Rewards card to earn points on your hotel stay and anything you charge to your room
-I booked through a 3rd party website and it made things difficult, please book directly through Planet Hollywood

Bad:
-if you need extra towels, it's easier to find housekeeping in the hallways and ask in person rather than call down for it
-there was an issue with the sound system in the suite and they did not show up until after the next day
-checking into the hotel takes a solid half hour at minimum
-The Boulevard Suite has a great common room, but only a single queen size bed in each of the adjoining bedrooms

As for the hotel, the rooms are adequate but starting to show their age.

Check in took around 10 minutes or so (it was around 2pm). Also got a handy coupon book which could be used at various Harrah's properties along the Strip.

While there was no Strip view, room 2258 was on the 22nd floor on the North side; close to the elevators. The room itself was clean, albeit worn in a few places. I can't remember the name of the movie the room featured, but it must have been some C-list film anyway. The room seemed a little dark, but I think that was because most of the furnishings were darker colored. I had light where I needed it, which was good enough for me. 

The bathroom is a larger-than-average affair, with a large soaking tub (no jets), a decent sized sink, and a shower big enough for two. While the rooms have been renovated, some touches of the old Aladdin remain...like the faucets and door handles for instance. Toiletries were PH branded, smelled nice, and got the job done.

I ate on-site a few times. They have cheaper places, like Pink's hot dogs, along with moderate and pricier places such as P.F. Chang's and Strip House. I also did the Spice Market buffet for brunch one morning. There are also a bunch of restaurants in the attached Miracle Mile Shops, so there's no shortage of dining options.

Oh, speaking of Miracle Mile. One of the nicest malls I've been in. i was able to get a pair of Crocs because my feet were killing me from all the walking I'd been doing. 

As for the casino, it's a bit confusing to navigate. Once you get your bearings, it's a bit easier to deal with. I had a few drinks at the Heart Bar and Extra Lounge, which was fun. Even more fun were the $10 roulette tables!!! lol. Cocktail service was a bit wonky...it was faster to go to the Heart Bar and get a drink than to wait for a cocktail waitress. The overall vibe was very young, hip, and trendy.

PH is probably in one of the best locations on the Strip. Very close to Paris, Bellagio and CityCenter. Also, beware of the guys who are trying to sell Timeshares...they hang out at various escalators in the casino and may even be near the elevator banks as well. They try to entice folks with offers of free\/VIP admission to various parties in town. Blah.

The first time I stayed here the experience failed on all levels and I swore up and down I would never return. However, when looking for a weeks stay I found a heck of a deal and was (to the penny) $1200 less than the MGM side for the same duration of visit. That had me feeling like I was a VIP or getting away with murder.

One major plus for PH is the location as it's in the heart of the strip and smack dab in the middle of where I usually inhabit. I split my gambling between Planet Hollywood and MGM so with close access to Bellagio and the tram from PH ease of getting around was a breeze. If I ever did decide to do it someday I know there is the monorail behind PH to maneuver up through that end of the strip as well. 

Beyond that, I loved how the elevators were strategically placed away from the action and rarely had 15 million people trying to pack into it at one time. Also there is enough assortment of food choices to keep you on the premises so kudos to that as well. There were only a handful of times we ventured out to our regular joints, but for the most part we were content with getting food and eating it in the confines of the room.

For the fashionista inside all of us being so close to the miracle mile was nice as well. I know having things like the ABC store for quick beverage runs added convenience to the trip and the vast array of stores was able to subdue the wife's shopping itch for hours on end during our stay as well. 

  The room itself was spaced out better this time around and looks like the decor got an upgrade since the last stay as well. The bed was very comfortable and the side chair was a joy to have as well to do my normal staring out the window at the Vegas life (don't worry I don't mean that to sound so creepy). 

On the Caesar's side I can say by far that this is my favorite hotel experience at this point and when a good deal presents itself a desired destination. I'm glad that it was a few bad apples the first time here who ruined my stay and it was not a direction reflection of what truly is Planet Hollywood.

Absolutely disgusting and so offensive and is why we don't go to the pool anymore. The Miracle Miles Shops is attached to this hotel which has great shops,  restaurants and bars.

You will have to walk through the mall to get to the hotel dragging your suitcases through the mall trying to  dodge people the entire time.

I would HIGHLY recommend the valet parking. If traveling with someone in need of handicap parking, valet is your only option.  
Check in...a front desk attendant with a personality, smiles and great conversation. Gave us an upgrade to a bigger room and a nice view of the strip :)
Restaurants...overpriced as you would expect but the service made up for it. Very attentive waitstaff at every eating establishment we encountered
Concert venue....an awfully long line that led around the Mile of Shops. They need to open their doors sooner to give that long single line of people a chance to get to their seats. When you arrive 30 minutes early to a show you would expect to see the whole show but because we waited in that entrance line for about an hour, we missed part of the opening act. However, service was exceptional here. When my friend needed assistance in the steep climb out of the venue, security didnt rush us out. They told us to take all the time we needed and one even offered his arm to her and assisted her out at her pace, not his.

Planet Hollywood Hotel is a great example of how customer service should be!",0,0,0

Coming to America is one of my top favorite movie and we ended up in the ""Coming to America"" themed room which I thought was funny lol.
Recently I stayed again for Labor Day weekend and OH BOY...
First, the parking garage walk to the hotel is A W F U L.
The walk is extremely far and I had to walk back and forth so many time.  HATED IT. 

Even with the remodeled room, the ac unit is old, the showers had like orange mildew, no long mirror, really dingy feeling and smelled.
We requested for a non smoking room and I woke up at 8am with the smell of cigars going through my AC VENT! WTH! I called downstairs and the front desk was beyond USELESS. So gross, I nearly gagged in my sleep. 

1 star for location and everything else I HATE.

They were staying at the Bellagio for four nights.  I was only going to stay for two nights, and by the time I had decided to go the Bellagio rates were higher than I wanted to pay for given the quick stay over.  Since Planet Hollywood was just across the street from the Bellagio, and the rate seemed reasonable, I decided to stay there.
I won't say that it was a horrible experience, but I was definitely disappointed.  The rooms are dated and didn't feel exceptionally clean.  The decor has a 1990's vibe to it.  I'm not sure how much of it is carryover from the Aladdin revamp prior, but it wasn't up to what I would consider ""current Strip standards"".  It seems appropriate that this is Britney Spears anchor arena for her shows - it has a slightly ""trashy"" feel to it. 
Some of the issues that I had regarding the room were:
- missing front of one of the drawers
- strange odor from the faucet water in sink
- pull chain shades that kept sticking
I can see being in my 20's and coming here to have a raging time, but those days are a little bit behind me at this point and would rather opt for comfort and modern amenities (like at Aria) than ""just a place to crash"" at the end of a long night.",1,0,0

This was my first time staying at PH.  Lots of things to review about, but some important items first:

1) Hotel Check-in:  My friend and I arrived early and saw their check-in kiosks and tried to see if we could check in early. They charge $20 for this, so we said, nah.  Right behind these kiosks are actual humans at a registration desk. I think it's by design they only have two people work at the desk. You arrive, it's hot (it was 113 outside), and just want to relax for a bit.  The have a guy near the kiosks to ask questions, but he wasn't super helpful. The line for registration was quite long, so, not super worth it.  We wandered about and came back at 3pm. My friend booked two beds and had the confirmation to say so. When we checked in with kiosk, it assigned a ONE king bedroom. We thought, WTF?! We asked the random guy, what the heck?! He said it's NOT guaranteed you'll get two beds even though you purposely book and pay for that.  He pointed us to the registration desk and the line never seemed to move (again, two people manning desk). Good thing we're friends and it's no big deal, but seriously?! Lame!! Disappointed in the room switcharoo.

Also, our room was great and had a great view of the nightly water show across the street and of Paris across the street.

One additional negative - the next morning, we were up early to shower and get to airport.  The shower door was stuck due to the rubber and we feared we'd break it. Had to call maintenance to fix. It took him about 15-20 min.  He mentioned they remodeled these rooms a bit ago, but do yourself a favor, ensure the door actually opens when you arrive! 

2) Hotel buffet - PASS!!!  We heard such great things about their dinner buffet. It's down below and costs $39.  Nice spread and vast offering of different types of cuisine.  Sadly, the food atvmany of the stations was sub-par.  A lot of the rolls\/bread was stale.  Some of the meat lacked actual flavor.  The salad station needs more toppings. I'm also diabetic and was told they had a great selection of sugar free or diabetic friendly items. Well, when you walk up, how would you know which is diabetic friendly?  I had to wait and ask the baker. She pulled two items from fridge underneath. Just a couple cakes.  

Recommendation: SKIP!!!! Not worth the money and the food doesn't seem to be super fresh or have much actual flavor.  We both left thinking, that was disappointing.

3) Plus side - the indoor mile long mall. It has everything!! If you need water, snacks, etc, skip Hotel store and go to the ABC store. Much better savings.

4) Axis theater - we were there for the Backstreet Boys and that was the major highlight.",0,0,0

When I stay in Vegas, I'm not one of those people who say: ""oh, it doesn't matter, you only need a place to sleep.""

If I can't sleep well, I can't party hard. You feel me, dawg?

Pluses:
- Central location

- For our two night stay, I only had to call housekeeping once for extra towels, they gave us more than two nights worth, which I appreciated.

- There's a Starbucks at the casino floor if you want a light breakfast in the morning (because you should save you appetite for the buffet!) 

Cons:
- the DOUBLE beds. Not as comfortable as other Vegas hotels I've stayed in, and the standard rooms at other hotels have at least QUEEN beds.

- Had an attitude problem at check in with Bernie. He wasn't entirely rude, but he was not willing to hear my explanation either and instead just stated ""i've seen this a hundred times, but you still have to pay additional $$$"" to secure the room. WTF.

- The pool area. IT SUCKS. When I go to Vegas, it's all about the pool for me! PH is unacceptable: uncomfortable plastic lounge chairs, small pool, some of the towels were tattered. Please invest in new towels! (the employees at the pool area were all very nice and courteous though)

pools were nice, and there was a huuuge space filled with rows of lounge chairs to take drunk naps in and listen to some chill music.

Room: I got completely remodeled floor with a 22nd floor room overlooking the Bellagio fountains so that was the best aspect of the room. The room itself was clean and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was fine except you could tell the shower was getting older. The grout was not sparkling. Worst thing was that the room and the hotel smelled like smoke, especially if you didn't turn on the A\/C. Wireless or wired Internet was $13.99\/24 hour period. Sucky thing is that you cannot pay once and use wired and wireless with same computer. Lame. The movie theme of my room was a Tom Arnold movie called ""The Stupids."" I had never heard of it and after reading about, it is appropriately named.

The Hotel: I think the smokers come to this hotel to suck in everyone elses' 2nd hand smoke since the ventilation in this system does not seem to work as well as the newer hotels. They must have not spent money redoing the system when it changed names. This hotel was particularly difficult orienting yourself to where exits are. I had to find landmarks so I could go in the direction I wanted. The PH employees trying to grab you at the entrances are annoying. I have no idea what they were selling since I avoided them every time (but from other reviewers: it seems to be a timeshare trap). Did not see this at any other hotel.

Location in center strip is very good. If you want to use the monorail, you have to go next door to Paris and travel your way to Ballys through the Paris mall.

Verdict: I always thought the PH restaurants were cheesy and knockoff. I think this hotel follows suit.",3,1,2

We got a free upgrade to a suite which had a sitting area with a flat screen t.v. and another flat screen t.v. in front of the bed.  We got a view of the swimming pools and we were also able to view the fountain show from Bellagio hotel.  The bathroom was huge with a jacuzzi tub and also a shower and it had two separate sinks.  The only downside to the bathroom was that it was right in front of the bed and there is no door; so in the morning, the light would come in and it seems like you left the light on in the bathroom (there is a shade for the window in the bathroom but it really didn't do much to keep the light out).  

The swimming pools are okay; there are two separate swimming pools and jacuzzi but the pools weren't really that big.  I didn't even go in because the water was cold.  But it was a nice location to just chill.

The parking lot is a bit far from the lobby.  I wasn't too thrilled that I had to drag my suitcase with me halfway through the Miracle Mile Mall.  I like that there were a lot of places to eat there and I highly recommend Earl of Sandwich, they have delicious sandwiches, salads and wraps (it was about $6.00\/sandwich which is a great deal especially in Las Vegas).

The only complaint I have would be that the walls are thin, I think the people in the next door were having a party and it was very loud.  For both nights, I heard a lot of noise coming from the other room, I was very tempted to notify the hotel, but I didn't.

The decor was still in the Aladdin style, but that's ok.  The mall was not as big as other resort malls on the Strip, but pretty decent  -- Urban Outfitters, Victoria's Secret, H&M, Gap, etc. 

The casino was very confusing to navigate and my girls and I got lost our first night there.  (It didn't help that we were drunk either. lol)  The EXTRA lounge was nice and I thoroughly enjoyed having karoake in my hotel.  

This hotel isn't THE best on the Strip, but it's definitely not THE worst.  We stayed in an older (non-renovated) room and it was pretty decently size.  It was a resort room with a tub separate from the shower and two separate sinks. This was perfect since I was there with my girls and we needed space to get ready for those long nights out.   The first room that we had was too warm.  The air conditioner was broken and it was quite uncomfortable, but after a quick visit to the helpful front desk we were able to change rooms.  Overall, we tried not to be disappointed because it's Vegas -- you're there for a good time.   We weren't in our room much anyways.  We got a great deal on Priceline, so we couldn't complain. 

Reasons for only 3 stars:
1. confusing casino layout
2.  missing glassware from room (we had three glasses instead of four)
3.  broken air-conditioner making our first night (morning) uncomfortable 
4. in-room safe was missing from our second room
5.  their nightclub Prive started to suck after a couple of hours of being there

The Boulevard Suite is a one-bedroom suite - the bedroom portion resembles a standard Planet Hollywood room, with a bigger bathroom (had a jacuzzi tub). The living area where the pool table and conversation areas are had an entirely different character - black is the predominate color with white accents. The room was very cool, but lacked some of the luxury - tech features of the newer mega-resorts - ie. tv in the bathroom, automated drapes, automated light controls, etc. One minor fault I give to PH is that the self parking garage is ridiculously far from the hotel.

Check-in\/out: I was expecting to walk in and see the huge line to check in. I know there were tons of people in the hotel, so it wasn't a question of a lack of patrons. The line was short and quick, and the self checkout via my phone made it such that I didn't have to visit the front desk again at all. Once I walked the strip and went into other hotels, I felt lucky that I didn't have to wait in the kind of lines I saw at other places. Luxor and Aria come to mind right off the top of my head.

Location: Perfect. Right in the middle of the strip, across the street from the Bellaggio. 
Room: Very nice. For the price I paid, it was quite large, nicely appointed, and the restroom was HUGE. It had a nice big bathtub as well as a stand-up shower, and the toilet was in its own little room. It did surprise me that it didn't have a fridge, though to be honest, I probably wouldn't have used it. But just to let you know.

Wi-Fi: It was very confusing to discern whether some of these Vegas hotels had free Wi-Fi or not. In the case of PH, if you're paying the $32ish dollar ""resort fee"" (which I don't know who DOESN'T have to pay that), it includes free in-room WI-FI, and it worked pretty well. In fact, if you want to use your own cellular data, the signal is MUCH slower than theirs.

Ambience: The hotel was lively, casino was always busy (even on a Monday and a Tuesday), and the staff was always friendly. One thing I was dreading was the smell of smoke I had read about in Vegas reviews in general, but I never felt it in their casino. Maybe because their ceilings are like 4 stories high, it ventilates pretty nicely?

I didn't rent a car, so I can't speak for the parking situation, though I have to admit just to the naked eye, it looked like an incredible pain in the ass, which I suspect it's because it's got the shopping mall attached. The RTC transportation buses made it really easy and affordable to travel the entire strip north to south, though with so many stops, it could take a while. You're sightseeing anyway, so it didn't bother me.

We enjoyed gaming here as well, lots of choices and plenty of staff offering drinks. 

There is also the shopping.  You can never go wrong with a mall in your hotel.  It offered us so many food choices at every meal.  There were show options in the mall as well as drink options everywhere.  I have stayed here with and without kids.  Without kids involved a lot more drinking and appreciation for the shows and bars.  With my kids, they loved the shops and the water show and seeing all the lights from the room.  

The room was in great condition and well kept during out stay.  The hotel maids were very friendly and accommodating.   There are a few sweets that stink because they have that huge poster hanging on the side of the building so it limits the view from the room.  It's a million or billion little dots that cover the window so you can still see Vegas but you can't take pictures because of the dots (poster) over the window.  There are the upper floor suites.

the first room i was given had a constant ""whir, whir, whir"" sound. the window also had a strange vent that pumped dust into the room when opened. i called the desk and they said ""yes, your room is next to the service elevator shaft. we can move you."" great, i go down to the desk and they have no idea what i am there for. i have to explain all over again. 

second room was fine. until i put my feet into the bed sheets and found half of them were missing. my feet were on some weird scratchy mat thing, and the mattress. i had to remake my own bed before i could go to sleep.

wanted to order room service, but all the food pages from the book in the room had been removed. ordered another copy so i could order food, but it took forever to arrive. i called after 15 min and was told ""just wait, he's busy and it takes him time"". bah, i left and ate elsewhere.

the decorations in both rooms included weapons. a giant knife and a pistol inside a clear-top table in the first room, and a throat-cutting wire and a stabbing knife in the second room. the pictures on the wall were of schwarzenegger pointing large guns at someone not in the frame. bedroom -- pistol. bathroom -- automatic rifle. just what i want to see when i am about to take a dump...hey, look it's arnold in a threatening pose with a gun pointed at me. sadly it did not scare the shit out of me, if that was the intent.

wtf? is there a room that doesn't have violent and gory death as a theme? another reviewer mentioned logan's run. i guess violence is what they mean by celebrity and hollywood-esque these days. come to think of it the curtains and chair were a convenient dark blood color.

oh, tried to use the spa but they said all their systems were offline and infotech had to come fix things. i walked in at 6am and asked if they could fit me into their first slot of the day, but they said they were unable to function without their computer screen. they called me at 9am and asked if i was still interested. 3 hours of sitting around waiting just to see if your calendar is free. brilliant.

last comment. i was constantly hassled by people idling around by the doors. these pesky sales people would say ""have you received your free gift?"" and then try to chase me down and convince me to sign up on some 90 minute pitch for real estate. over and over and over, every time i came or went by the doors some sales person was chasing after me with an offer i just could not refuse. please. no more. one woman even tried saying ""hey, just come over here. i really need to tell you something"" when i came out of the elevators. they should give out a ""leave me the f('&&#$k alone"" symbol to wear so you can turn them down permanently.

update: do not use the fast checkout process. a $5.95 room charge appeared on my credit card. i called accounting and after a 30 min hold time was told one of the water bottles in the room was missing. i told them i didn't touch the water. they agreed to reverse the charge, but only after i read my credit card info to them over the phone. eh? if they had my number to bill me for the mysterious bottle after i checked out, why do they need me to read them the number again to reverse the mistake?

moments later i noticed i was billed for a spa appointment that mentioned above. i was not allowed to go because the computers were not working. and yet my room was charged after i checked out. after 15 min on hold the accounting department said they could not help me and transferred me to the spa. the spa put me on hold for another 15 min. when they tried to look up my appointment they found a completely different set of charges and said they had to research the differences. again i had to give them my credit card over the phone. 

now i can see that random charges are being sent to my room number, which is then tied to my credit card. so disputing any of the charges requires you to give the credit card number to someone on the phone. seems like a scam to me.

dropping my rating from 3 to 2 star due to the hassles, mistakes, erroneous billing and deceptive practices. they say they are refunding the full amount, so i'll leave it at 2 stars for now. if i have to continue to waste time on this, it'll be headed straight to planet 1 star.",6,2,1

To get to the hotel you have to trek down pretty much the entire mall to reach the check in for the hotel. Could be different if you use valet but we did self park. 

Room was nice and well maintained upon entry. The pool set up is weird as well. They have a ton of open area that pretty much consists of just nothing. Also nothing dazzling about the pool. Just a square with a few cabanas set up around it. Would i stay here again? Tough call for me. Possibly if the Wynn or Cosmo were sold out.

Arrived 8:45 pm,  after driving nearly 600 miles, used the kiosk to check in,  received the keys, then learned the room was not what we had reserved.  I called the front desk,  explained the situation,  was placed on hold for the better part of 10 minutes then disconnected,  no one bothered to return my call. 
I went back down to the desk from the 21st floor,  waited approximately 15 minutes then spoke to a young man at the desk, he said we don't have any king rooms available,  I asked why then was my reservation confirmed for a room that wasn't available?  He merely shrugged as if to say that's the way it goes... he did offer to cancel my reservation so I could look elsewhere...
I was floored, if this is customer service it's beyond comprehension. I asked to speak with a manager,  met a woman who said she was the supervisor,  her attitude was little better, she said ""maybe we can switch you to the room you requested tomorrow""

Check in goes very smoothly and the reps are always polite and helpful. In the room there was Hollywood paraphernalia on the walls of the bathroom and living area. The decor was very modern and trendy, which gave a great upbeat atmosphere to the room and hotel itself. And you can't beat the location of PH on the strip, it's right in the middle & I've always had ridiculous prices so I was sold. 

One time a friend and I was stopped by one of the time share reps as we were walking around, so we stopped to talk to them and actually signed up for the presentation because one of the gifts were $200 in promotional chips. And another time they were giving away free bottles each night of your stay. 

Found out that it's no longer Prive but now Gallery... anyways Prive was pretty amazing! I've gotten in thru comped tables and VIP entry, thankfully I've never paid to get in there. Great music, people and waitstaff. We partied all night long every time til about 5:30 or so. And when we had our table Big Sam was awesome and he took care of us big time!

Koi is a Japanese restaurant also located inside of PH. It's a pretty decent place to eat.

The one dislike that I noticed was in the rooms there are still fixtures from when it was the Aladdin. That's probably my one complaint, PH remodeled nicely and I would have thought that they could spring for their own fixtures. Overall I've had good times there and would go back.",1,0,1

Here I go. My wife and I stay here at the hotel for 5 days. We drop our car off on a Thursday and pick it up on the following Monday in Valet. When we come out on Monday my tire light is on and there is a nail in the side of my tire. We had driven 250 miles no lights no issues. I file a report with security and go on my way to get a new tire since my car doesn't come with a spare. $302.00 later I would like reimbursed. I call their ""Loss prevention"" phone number 10 times. I leave messages every time nobody ever calls me back. I finally call Caesars International and they assign a person to research the incident. Almost 2 months later( June 26th-August 15th) he concludes that there was no construction at the time of my occurrence so it couldn't have happened there! Are you kidding me? Mind you I have been a Diamond member at Caesars for many years. I have never asked for anything even if I feel something wasn't right. This situation, however, really upsets me. I have spent thousand of dollars at their properties but I can assure you I will never spend another dime there. It's the principal of the matter.

Stayed here midweek while in Vegas for work. It was my 7-8th time in Vegas in the lat 2 years and first at Planet Hollywood. I had the resort package or whatever. for 3 days it came out to roughly $400. The room was spacious, but that's about all that it has going for it. 

First off, the self-parking is way to far from the hotel, even for Vegas. Yes, there is Valet, but that still no excuse. 

The decor looks cheap and lazy. The elevator doors are way too fast and close on literally everyone.

The wifi is slow and actually tracks your data, as  result I was unable to log in to my works VPN, or even play video games.

I call it in and got put on the line with IT, who basically said everything looked fine. and they didn't see any issues with tracking my data.

Then, I ordered chicken wings to my room. They weren't good, but I didn't care because I was starving. The guy hands me the bill and it had gratuity included. So I tip the difference in the amount I would have tipped and included gratuity..

The dude looks at it and goes: ""So you're only tipping me three dollars?"" 
I go: "" Gratuity is added""
Him, sarcastically: ""I know, enjoy your stay at Planet Hollywood""

K.

So I brought a toothbrush and toothpaste travel kit from the last hotel I stayed at.. Somehow my toothbrush snapped and so I call the front desk for a dental kit. The inform me rather rudely that they don't provide toothbrushes. What kind of hotel doesnt provide toothbrushes. To make things worse, the cleaning people saw the snapped brush i had and threw it away... along with toothpaste I had left.

The rates were totally inflated and I'm sure that there was probably an event there this past weekend as well as a Canadian holiday however, totally not worth it. We were there for 4 nights. 

Blaring Britney Spears was enough to kill me - all weekend long in all the common areas. 

We went to 2 restaurants, 1 club and the gym here - as well as the Starbucks. Underwhelmed is all I have to say. 

And lets not forget the pool - full of garbage, murky as a milkshake and generally lacking any cleanliness on the entire rooftop scenario. Garbage, human hair and fluids everywhere - disgusting. The pool actually glowed ORANGE at night it was so dirty. Like another reviewer said - feels like you're in a parking lot. 

The gym was in the spa area and only open until 7pm. Equipment was old and looked like something my grandpa would've built in his own basement - the photos online are NOT what their gym actually looks like, do not be fooled. 

At Koi nightclub we got bottle service and had the equivalent of rocket fuel served to us - we were both very sick from the poor quality vodka - I can't remember if we were offered anything of a decent quality......we gave 1\/2 of our bottle away to strangers. 

Rooms were relatively clean, but our $70 per night upgrade got us a minute view of the pool and the bulk of the view was their rooftop satellites (we were on the 9th floor).

All this glory for about $250 per night. 

Decent location - would never stay there again.

Maid service:

The maid stopped replacing the ice bucket and glass cups I used after the 1st day of my stay. Sometimes some of the towels weren't replaced either. The light switches and shower area definitely needed some TLC.

Elevators:

This is the 1st time out of several stays where I experienced elevator problems. One day it was an elevator that kept on clearing out the buttons that were pressed each time it would stop at a floor. Now imagine if you were on the 20th floor and there were people stopping at floors below you. Next day it was waiting for an elevator at the casino level. 20 minutes passed by and all the elevators seemed to be going down, but none were coming up. There was a crowd building up as we were waiting for elevators. Some of us decided to just take the elevator going down and just ride it up because none of them were stopping to go back up after going to the lobby. And this was on a busy Friday night.

Hallways:

I see trash left outside of doors that aren't picked up even after maid service cleans up rooms. I also see trash just thrown on the elevator floors and not picked up. Does Planet Hollywood even care about their appearance anymore? 

Planet Hollywood forces you to pay a resort fee, but lately this hotel has been feeling anything but that. Remember to use WI-FI since that's included with the forced resort fees anyway.

The hotel room was clean, spacious, and everything worked. Our room had props from Jurassic Park which I thought was awesome. The only small flaw I found in the room was the closet. It was tiny but it wasn't a problem for me. 
The casino is super fun. Even at 5 in the morning its happening. We walked around the surrounding hotels after clubbing and they were all dead. PH was the only one still playing loud music and had people mingling and gambling. The bar\/lounge Heart I think it was called was really fun. Perfect place to people watch and sip on a few drinks. There is even a mall downstairs. This can get dangerous if you find that you have free time. Way too easy to go and spend money on cute shoes and clothes. Theres also tons of places to eat.

The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is the pool. I think the pool is the biggest problem with this hotel. The layout makes no sense! The lack of trees and shade makes the pool area very unpleasant. However, its not difficult to go to other hotel's pools.

Bathtub was excellent, but it would've been cool to have the shower gel double as bubble bath.  I liked how spacious the bathroom was.  Storage space was little to none, and I had a great view of the underutilized pool.

On to the room, if your expectations are to frigidly underwhelmed, then this is your utopia of discontent. The room was dated, with a subtle essence of smoke. The decor was basic and boring. Our particular room had themes from the movie ""that old feeling"" starring Bette Midler. We got an ""OLD FEELING"" from theme of little relevance. Updates needed all around. The restroom seem to be the most updated thing in the outdated room. However there were issues with the water barely being warm and the room itself, FREEZING! Clearly hearing everyone else shower or use the bathroom was also annoying! The best part of room 3067 was the view of the Belagio & Caesar's Palace with mountains in the background.

First off, we got what's called a ""Hollywood Hip"" room. It has a good amount of space for inviting friends to hang out with a desk, double bed, and two chairs. If you go down to the casino floor, there's a pretty good sandwich place called Earl of Sandwich. We ate here four times in six days, so we're fans. You're also in the middle of the strip which was really convenient in blazing hot weather.  There's an ABC store and a Walgreens around the corner so most Vegas goers should be stocked for whatever they need. But as convenient as it was, we won't be going back.

The really large negative was that the room was pretty gross. I put on clean white socks and after an hour of walking around unpacking in them, I took them off to discover they were black. Also, the fact that it has Hollywood memorabilia isn't enough to really capture my attention. Yeah, we had the Paradise Island room, which was kinda neat, but it's like these few pieces are trying to distract you from the fact that this is kind of a boring (and severely unclean) Vegas resort. It's got a flashy, loud casino floor.. but just look at the Bellagio, or Caesar's, or Mandalay Bay. They at least have some character.

The restaurants inside the hotel are actually pretty good. Everyone loves Earl of Sandwich because it's so accessible, Planet Dailies is good for American food, Yolos has great chips and salsa and Mexican food, and Strip Steak is their fancy and tasty steakhouse.

Unfortunately, at the moment, PH doesn't have much of a club scene. Prive closed down because of shady management, and Koi is a sorry excuse for a club. Please don't go there (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/koi-las-vegas-2#hrid:tlABUss3VIxG44GWmDrWvQ)... I'm trying to save you!

My BF loves to gamble in their casino. I like to strut around and people watch in this fun casino. Their central bar, The Heart Bar is sexy as hell. Actually much of PH is sexy... :)

PH gets huge points for the Miracle Mile Shops - you can just pick up anything you need that you may have forgotten you need, like some patent leather leggings or fishnet stockings. How convenient!

I have to say, I was really unimpressed by their pool situation. They have two teeny tiny pools in the corners of a gigantic cement area on top of the casino. The cabanas are just jazzed-up EZ-Up tents that they charge an arm and a leg for. My suggestion, and what we did, was walk through the Miracle Mile Shops to the Planet Hollywood Westgate pool instead - it's gorgeous, fun, and bigger. (See review for more details: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/planet-hollywood-towers-by-westgate-las-vegas#hrid:E1YnkqHysH2EaSWEegtDrQ)

Overall, I like to stay at this place. It's fun for younger Vegas-goers like us, it's centrally located, and it's connected to the Miracle Mile! What more could you want?!",4,0,2

It's been a mere two months since I've been back and BOY and I ELATED to report that the renovations are mind-blowing! Hooray for $40M upgrades!! I am still dismayed at the plumbing--the shower drain takes forever; it's gross having your feet wade in the after bath. Ha ha!
Planet Hollywood. The former Jolly Roger.  
The reason I rated this go-to hotel a mere 3-stars is mainly due to infrastructure in the rooms. 

POSITIVES: High energy, fun dealers and dancers, bartenders & great weekend DJ's.  The on-site Miracle Mile Mall is a plus: eateries and a variety of places to dine and shop at make it a pleasant experience for anyone.  The resident performers have been a hit as well: Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez & most recently, Lionel Richie (so awesome--must see!). Oh, and let's not forget to mention their Sports Book: cozy and easy to watch multiple games.

CONS: I have grown tired of rooms that have toilets that run all day and sinks that don't drain quickly, along with shower heads that are a hit-or-miss in terms of pressure.  Also, sometimes we have nice hot water; other times, barely hot water. 
The pillows are disappointing. I feel like I'm laying my head on soft balloons. 

In the end, the pros always outweigh my cons. Hence, this is our hotel of choice.",0,0,0

1) You can't sit on the chairs by the pool, you have to pay 100 bucks or so to reserve
2) Pool area is soooo plain and boring (unlike Bellagio pools, even Excalibur and time share pools like Tahiti Village were superb)
3)Found a huuuuge lonely booger floating around in the pool. haha gross

Another downer: 
Sometimes you get unlucky with a weird movie themed room.
The room we got was kind of awkward (Robocop??), especially since our party consisted of my girl and her sisters (contrary to common beliefs, girls aren't fascinated by big mechanical guns). They were like ""Wtf?""

Other than that, this is the ideal place to come do what y'all come here to do: act a fool, jump on your beds, run across the hotel hallways drunk to your trunks pretending you're Superman wrapped around in a bedsheet cape... at 5 am in the morning.

The best thing about it all is that you don't have to call a taxi when you're all done with this gorgeous-looking hotel and your legs can't walk for shit anymore, cause HEY GUESS WHAT, you're already home!

We got a pretty good rate and the quality of the room itself was better than some of the other hotels on the strip, but obviously not the greatest. I liked that the room was spacious. Ours was a standard room with 2 beds. The bathroom has a tub and a shower stall and the toilet has its own door which is nice when you're sharing with a lot of people. 

Location-wise PH is okay. It's a little far from hotels like the Wynn, but it was conveniently close to Aria. It's kinda give and take with the strip, right, you can't be close to everything! If you're into shopping then PH is perfect because the miracle mile shops are right there. Their food choices are also pretty good because there's an Earl of Sandwich (cheap, awesome sandwiches and soups), Pink's hot dogs (an LA native's fave, although I've actually not eaten at the Vegas one), and there's a Fat Tuesday (definitely an essential)!

I do have a couple of complaints about PH, though. The room lighting was really scarce. They were missing a few lamps in there. With 8 girls trying to do hair and makeup at once, finding a well-lit corner of the room was quite difficult to do. And why is their parking garage soooo far. It felt like we were the only ones carrying luggage through the entire miracle mile, but I'm guessing others had to do it. Sorry I'm not really one to valet, and that was a pain to get to the check-in lobby area. Ugh, and that check-in line seemed to take a decade. We checked in around 8pm-ish, so I wouldn't expect a crowd, but it still took a long time. What's with that?? 

Overall they might've gotten 3 stars, but they did give us a free bottle with each room (they didn't really skimp either - Skyy and Seagram's, I think it was). Sweet, 4 stars it is :]",1,0,0

PH is in a great location on the strip across from the Cosmo and Bellagio. From Planet Hollywood's block down to the Venetian block is the best part of the strip, IMO. Middle of the strip casinos have higher table minimums (not so good) but have great places to eat, tons of places to shop, and many places to quench your thirst. Outside of that area on the strip are good places for cheap eats\/drinks, and have less expensive slots and tables. 

PH casino is huge and I've read about people complaining how big the casino was - that was a positive for me as I'm not afraid to walk and would prefer a large casino, esp not when I'm in Vegas. 

Spice Market Buffet was ok. Honestly, if I didn't get free tickets to eat there, I never would have picked there. I'm happy I went to one buffet while in Vegas. I've read tons of reviews on buffets, but there are such better places to eat then buffets while in Vegas. Earl of Sandwich is a great place to get a quick bite to eat. $25 will get you 2 sands, 2 drinks, and 2 chips. Pink's is at the front of the hotel and was a decent place to stop and get a hot dog. It was $25 for 2 dogs and one drink.  

People need to remember that you are not staying at the Venetian, Bellagio or Cosmo and if you want to pay 3 times more then what PH charges, then stay at the other hotels. My room was clean, had more then enough room for 2 people and really all we needed to shower, change, and sleep. I really liked the area of the strip that the hotel was located and thought the casino was a great place to make my donation.",5,1,2

We were traveling with our son and two dogs and decided to stop in Vegas to meet up with my sister and her family.  They put us in a 'Pet Room' which apparently means we have to sleep in a room that a number of animals used as a bathroom.  Which, you can't blame the animals because there is no convenient place near the hotel rooms for them to pee.  The 'dog park' is downstairs, across four lanes of valet traffic and is a pathetic patch of grass.  It is dark and hidden and a little (a lot) scary at night.

Where do I begin? I have had PH on my list of hotels to stay when visiting Las Vegas and I was looking forward to staying there. The pictures on line of course, appeared to be well appointed and contemporary. What the hotel offered was contemporary but worn and torn! 

The lobby is very misleading. It was clean, vibrant and colorful, which made me excited to see my room. As soon as I hit the elevator and saw the doors close, I knew something was very off. There were scuff marks on the walls of the elevator, scratches and initial carvings in the metal and the doors looked like they had been kicked several times with scratches and dents. Approaching my room, the hall way carpet was torn and stained in several spots, unravelling and bubbled in others. I came to discover during my stay that all the elevators were beat up.

I got to my room, the Resort Room, and it was covered in a layer of dust everywhere. There were spill marks on the desk with splatter marks down the leg of it. By that point I was uneasy and checked the bed for bed bugs! I opened the closet to hang my clothes and noticed the wood was chipped all throughout the bureau, with the worst of it where the ironing board was placed. One of the drawers didn't open properly.
I called to have the room cleaned and dusted. Throughout my entire stay of 3 days, no one cleaned the spill marks down the table leg. There were chips in the wood on the tables as well.

The pool - another disaster! PH charges $118 for reserved day beds. That would be great if the daybeds weren't all stained with mysterious spots, some of them questionably large and obvious. Regular deck chairs are wobbly, with support bands busted off or missing. And since they were supposed to be white, they were visibly dingy.

The casino - Signs pointing you where to go are confusing. As a group of 6, we got lost quite a bit, continually walking in circles, even when sober, lol! We actually started paying attention to location markers like light fixtures and escalators as points of reference because the signs were useless. Not to mention, the casino constantly had dirty glasses and beer bottles everywhere. The place just couldn't stay cleaned up. The Strip entrance to the casino was horrid. The glass doors were never clean, with a dirt film of finger and handprints covering the inside and outside.

Call me partial, but I love a clean, well appointed hotel, no matter if its cheap or expensive. If I'm paying upwards of $800 for 3 days, I want what I paid for which is high quality, good service and cleanliness. I'm very disappointed with the cleanliness and upkeep of Planet Hollywood. I have stayed in many different hotels on the strip from the Stratosphere to the Bellagio and I will not stay at Planet Hollywood again. I will not recommend it to anyone.",0,0,0

Pool ain't great and rooms are now a bit outdated, but I do really like the convenience of the Miracle Mile mall attached to this hotel and also the location of the hotel casino on the Las Vegas strip.

I've stayed here in the past and again most recently in June 2015 and the rooms have since outdated themselves.  We rented two rooms right next to each other and opened the connecting doors.  Rooms were a fair size.  Two queen size beds each with large bathrooms that included a jacuzzi soaker tub, stand-up shower, long counter with only one sink, and its own toilet room with door within the bathroom.  Beds were a fair deal for comfort.

The service is just fine - didn't run into any problems.  On the last morning when I was leaving early the safe was not  opening up with the code we thought it had been.  I called downstairs immediately because I needed to take out my passport, and the service man came up pretty quickly!  

All in all, I'd stay in this hotel again and recommend it for mainly it's location on the strip, fair price, and the convenience of Miracle Mile shops.  Plus there's an upper walkway to get to Cosmo hotel pretty quickly.",5,3,4

PH always has GREAT room deals on the off season, which is why I ended up here that fateful weekend. See, I was having my bachelorette party, all of my friends were on a budget, but I really wanted to stay on the strip for my Vegas stay. Enter PH, which had rooms at a ridiculous $20 or so a night. Sold! The rooms are nothing amazing, but they are clean and this hotel is centrally located on the strip. 

However, this wouldn't be my first choice. Part of the fun of coming to Vegas is staying in a really cool, really swanky hotel and PH just isn't one of them. It is the practical and economical choice, if there is one, in Vegas.

It's the equivalent of going to a restaurant and being charged a utensil fee.

Additionally, my smoke free room on a smoke free floor had smoke permeating from somewhere.  And I'm not sure if PH is now pet friendly, but somebody's dog had definitely pissed in this room because it really stunk like dog pee.  I was going to look with my UV light but thought better of what other atrocities I might uncover.

For locals PH has by far the most inconvenient and furthest self park lot. I actually parked at The Cosmo because it was closer to my room.

A few clicks around the internet later, and we found a pretty solid deal for two nights here. No perks, but the price seemed reasonable for what looks like a great resort online. 

Whatever you do, DO NOT self park when you get here. You're probably thinking what I was thinking when I pulled up, which is that valet service probably isn't free, plus I just don't like handing my keys over to some knob so he can mess with my seat positioning and AC. So, we drove off the park ourselves... and wound up knee-deep in the Miracle Mile shops, where I proceeded to haul our bags for what seemed like all 5000+ feet of it before finally hitting the check-in station below. 

They were, of course, out of king beds for the room we booked, but the woman offered to upgrade us to a larger room with a king for no additional fee; the only downside being that it was a smoking room. We accepted, since Vegas is typically good at making sure smoking rooms don't smell like you'd expect them to. 

Our room was Wheel of Fortune themed. Kinda rad, even if I do think the show is lame. The round display case which held a board tile lit up neon green at night. That was cool, made for some nice ambiance. 

The room itself wasn't very clean. To the eye it was, but it could've definitely used some serious dusting. 

Here are a few cons:

- What is the point in boasting that there's a 42 in. plasma TV in my room when every station it gets is in standard definition? That's like saying you have all the latest films available on VHS. 

- No coffee maker, but there is a sign letting me know there's a Starfucks down below, eager to rape my wallet on the daily. 

- Room service prices appear to be high, as expected, but P.F. Chang's has a menu that's in line with the pricing if I were eating there anyway. Oh, hey there, $8 room service surcharge fee that's hiding down below in tiny font! Almost missed you there. 

- If you're getting drinks at the pool, make it a double. They're already bending you over to the tune of $14\/pop, what's another $4? Drink enough to forget what you paid for it. 

- They have a gym, and you can use it for the completely reasonable fee of 25 FUCKING DOLLARS A DAY. I laughed and left when informed of this. I suspect my laughter would have intensified had I actually seen the gym, since I doubt it's more than a couple treadmills and some mismatched dumbbells. 

- Wi-Fi isn't free. This will matter when you realize that AT&T gets a shitty signal in the building. 

I know this is how Vegas works, but charging me for every little amenity a la carte doesn't do a whole lot to insure my future business. I'm more likely to seek out a hotel that will include all of that in the price of the room. I don't go to Vegas to workout (I'm not a meathead or anything), but $25 to work off a night of drinking before the day begins is a slap in the face.

I was disappointed first of all that the bartender needed me to walk to the front desk (or concierge?..can't remember exactly which one) in order to redeem the coupon...and then come all the way back.  However, I was more disappointed when I got there and the supervisor REFUSED to help me.  She apparently was closing out and leaving and told me to come back in the morning.

We got a room on the 38th floor and when looking around I was a little shocked. The window is tiny and has a chair and lamp in front of it so it's pretty much useless. The bed was bare, all the lamp shades were in obscure positions, every surface was dusty, no fridge or coffee maker, and the room was just extremely outdated in general. 

Now the best part is how disgusting the bathroom was. The bathtub has random hairs inside and the sink faucet and handles were so gross and dirty I didn't even want to use it. I was pleasantly surprised to see how many towels we were given (bath towels and wash cloths) but when I went to use one, I found a small black curly hair inside. NO THANK YOU! 

But don't even get me started on the shower. I felt cleaner NOT using the shower and this is Vegas we are talking about. The shower tile and grout were black and dirty, the shower head had so much build up it barely let water flow through, and the drain smelled SO FOUL and disgusting we wanted to puke. No fan in the bathroom meant the smell lingered the entire weekend we were there. 

For the price we paid for the room, we could have stayed somewhere else with much nicer rooms and amenities. Guess that's what I get for booking last minute. 

Most definitely won't be staying here again.",1,0,0

Second best part? It's right across from the Cosmopolitan and is in general a great central location. We were going to Marquee last night for their one year anniversary, so we saved the taxi money. 

As far as level of luxury, on a scale of 1-10 I'd rate our room a 6.5 or 7. We were lucky and got upgraded to a room overlooking the strip. The view is amazing - you can watch the Bellagio fountain show from your room. As far as amenities goes, the basics were there and the bed was veryyy comfortable. The bathroom has a separate bathtub and shower, which I like, and there's a full length mirror, unlike the room in Excalibur that I stayed in last time. The one thing I wish they would add in the bathroom is a smaller personal\/face mirror, because I had to lean way over the sink to apply my makeup. Also, the lighting in the rooms is kind of soft and romantic, which makes it hard to tell if your makeup is applied correctly (but I guess it's a plus in general). There are no iPhone\/iPod speakers, sadly. 

Another thing I really like about Planet Hollywood is their food options - they have so many budget-friendly restaurants. There's Earl of Sandwiches, of course. And the morning after Marquee, we had $6 steak and eggs at Pampas, their Brazilian bbq restaurant. Soo good and a perfect cure for hangovers. ONLY SIX DOLLARS! 

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hotel for a Vegas trip.",3,2,2

On our last trip we were on the 23rd floor and had a view of the B fountains in a larger room which was nice. 

They have some good casual food places such as the Earl of Sandwich (AMAZING) and Planet Dailies. Pretty good buffet aswell.

Only thing we dislike is the staff, both at the reception (especially here) and the TR desk. Have had multiple problems happen on both of our last stays and the staff here is simply horrible. This would in my opinion be one of the top hotels in Vegas if it was not for the staff. Definitely one of the reasons why we will try and avoid PH in the future when we can.

We usually stay on comp nights so can't really complain, however the staff is just horrible.",1,1,1

The Good:

The hotel itself definitely caters to a younger crowd as it was made to look like a giant nightclub and there's party music blasting in the casino and elevators. It's also super convenient that the Miracle Mile (and Fat Tuesdays) is right downstairs. For a quick bite, check out the Earl of Sandwich. Affordable ($6.25 per sandwich) with good variety (salads, desserts, snacks, drinks) and the sandwiches are delicious. The location is pretty convenient, too, as it's pretty much in the middle of the strip.  

The Not So Good: 

Unfortunately, there are a few random things that made my stay a little less than enjoyable. The big thing was that the door to our room was broken and we got locked out of our room every night. Management was semi-helpful but the fact that the problem was no resolved during our stay was very disappointing. Little things that bugged me: the bathroom door in our room did not lock, the beds and pillows were not comfortable, and the room did not have a coffee maker or a mini bar\/fridge.

To be honest, it was mostly fine.  If you're looking for a no frills place (cuz you know, frills cost extra here in LV), PH is the place for you. If you don't mind shitty plumbing that wakes you up in the middle of the night because your neighbors are using the facilities, then this is also the place for you.

Cons:
Plumbing sucks. We sort of heard it here and there over the weekend but on our final night, our neighbors came in late and got up early.  When they use their plumbing both times, it was LOUD, even louder than if we were using our own bathroom.  We didn't sleep well.  It's in the walls so we couldn't even close the bathroom door or anything to muffle the sound.
Valet parking is virtually unavailable until about Sunday. Even when they charge $18 or $20 a day, it's packed.  No allowances for hotel guests.
We found trash in certain parts of our room so cleaning could be better.
Self-parking is miles away due to the unavailability of valet parking. At least it's free for now.
Dearth of good restaurants.
A whopping $40 a night for resort fee, turned our originally great deal to not a deal.
Our one window was tiny.  The curtain ran the length of the wall but we quickly realized our window was about 1\/3 of the wall.

Pros:  
Nice, modern rooms
Friendly cleaning staff (we didn't ask for service during our stay but did get extra shampoo)
Check-in is relatively painless; if you opt to use a human, the line goes fast at peak times.
Check-in staff is professional.
I like the set up where the lobby is near the entrance and ease of getting to the rooms.

Anyway, I'm sure most people find PH satisfactory but I prefer better.",5,3,3

But Planet Hollywood is not the best place I've stayed when I'm in Vegas ... and it's definitely not a place I would ever stay at again.

PROS:
1. The view (21st floor) was nice.  We had a view of Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and the PH's pools located on the 6th floor.

2. Valet parking. Pay the extra money for valet parking because it is a timesaver!!!  For self-parking, you need to trek the whole continent of Asia!  For self-parkers, you will need to walk the entirety of the Miracle Mile shops, go through the casino, and down the escalator until you get to the Registration area of PH.

CONS:
1.  Windows were filthy.  Though our view was nice, it would've been better if the windows were cleaned on a regular basis. For an establishment like PH, I assume they would pay the extra money for window washers to clean the outside of their windows.  They were disgusting.  Parts of the filth were so thick, I can imagine myself scraping it off with my fingernails.

2.  No refrigerator?!?!?!  Like I said above, our room was comped.  But for a typical Resort Room (which is their basic room at PH), there was no refrigerator.  Hmmm ... enough said.

3.  No cabinet\/drawer space.  When my fiancé and I travel, even if it's for 2-3 nights, we ALWAYS unpack everything.  Clothes go in drawers, get hung up on hangers in the closet, shoes are placed single-file at the bottom of the closets, and all our luggage is neatly stacked away.  But there were only 2 drawers (half-size drawers, mind you) in the entire room. There was the armoire where we can hang some of our clothes, but hardly any drawer space for socks, underwear, undershirts, shorts, etc.  

4.  Cords everywhere.  It's a pet peeve of mine to see tangled cords from light fixtures, lamps, alarm clocks, etc. just in a jumbled mess on the floor.  Tangled, lifeless cords were bunched up underneath the desk and along the wall.  They are ugly and a fire hazard.  

C'mon Planet Hollywood!  If you want to be a prestigious hotel, you need to make more of an effort (from your basic rooms to your high-end suites).  There should be no ""fine line"" distinction between your differences in accommodations.

My fiancé and I would NEVER pay money to stay at Planet Hollywood.  We've heard better reviews from their Towers section, so we might try it one day in the future.  But from now on, we'll stick to our faves: Aria and Bellagio.",4,3,0

They have dancing girls in the pleasure pit and you might even spot a celebrity or two. 

Definitely upset that they are rebuilding the poker room and have moved the once spacious room to a roped off corner next to the walkway of the shops as well as right next to the Earl's sandwich shop, it is very congested. The dealers are all very friendly and it is a pretty cool place to just hang out and people watch.

The poker tournament's are one of my favorites, my buddies do not like to play for big money so a $70 tournament at 11AM, 3PM and 7PM definitely fits the mold on a tournament that is afforable to enter.

I love the PH for the following reasons:

Condition.  The hotel and rooms have all been recently remodeled after they bought the property from Alladin a few years ago.  All the rooms have new carpets, new flat screen HDTV with tons of channel and comfortably furnished.

Crowd.  Unlike Mandalay with its shark tank or Venetian with its canals PH isn't actually a mega tourist magnet.  I find this a big plus because the hotel never gets too packed so that you have to wait hours to get a table at the restaurants.  Same case with the casino floor: I have never had to wait for a place at a table, slot or at the sports bookie.

Location.  PH is located between Paris and MGM Grand and directly across the Bellagio.  Why do I like this?  Well, what's the point of paying tons of money to stay at a Bellagio fountain view room where you can pay less for a room at PH with the same view of the fountain?

Price.  As with every other big hotel on the strip this hotel can get super expensive when there's a big event such as a championship boxing match.  However, during a normal weekend I think they offer the best value for your bucks compared to other hotels in the same price range.  Also, with the discount they give you for their buffet you'll be hard pressed to find a better deal on the strip.",0,0,1

One time they misunderstood us and thought one of us was really sick as in barf everywhere(?) which wasn't the case at all, so the guy brought a biohazard container haha! Good to know they're prepared for such situations!

It's a great place to stay mainly because of its location especially if you LOVE Earl's! Best sandwiches in Vegas and open 24 hours! You can just go right downstairs to get it which was so convenient! There's also the Miracle Mile shops where they have Fat Tuesday if you want those super huge long drinks, and it's also located right across the street from the Cosmopolitan if you want to go there for Wicked Spoon buffet, Chandelier Lounge, Marquee, etc. However, it is not close at all to Wynn, Encore, Venetian, if you plan on eating and clubbing there which is the one downside since cab fare over there will be a little more expensive.

- Whoever installed the carpet in the hallways had to have one too many margaritas by the yard. Can't tell you how many of us tripped over the wrinkling in the hallways.
- We spent more time fixing our toilet then actually using it. 
- The casino needs a better variety of slots. Especially Wheel of Fortune

Would I stay there again? Definitely. But mainly because I'm obsessed with Earls",0,1,0

The hotel itself is okay but nothing crazy if you compare to the crazy debauchery of other LV places like the Bellagio or the Caesar.

Rooms are clean, pretty nice (cool bathtub in there, free wifi) but for a 4* hotel, nothing crazy again! Beds are okay.

Not that bad huh? Why would I quit 3 stars then? Well the directions to the hotel are incredibly bad! When you are on the crowded Sunset Strip street, every hotel's entrance sign is glowing and showing you where to go.

Planet Hollywood's is hidden, you don't really know where the actual parking entrance is since there is no concrete mention of the hotel's name until you enter the actual parking, which is pretty stupid. Then begins the nightmare, you enter in a 10-story parking and you don't really know where to go once you're parked. Signs are really confusing (they often mistake the resort for the mall and the mall for the casino and so on), you never know where you're going.

We spent 20 minutes with heavy luggage wandering around in search of civilization and a lobby haha. We weren't the only one and judging people's lost-looking faces, many got trapped in there as well!

After that everything was fine. But please change the signs! For a 4* it's unacceptable to arrive at the lobby already pissed off.",2,0,0

The pros:
- The taxi line at this hotel is much shorter than any other on the strip, which is a huge plus when you're in Vegas for work.
- The hotel is not a huge labyrinth like some others like Mandalay Bay and MGM.
- Not a bad location on the strip. Opposite the Bellagio and Cosmopolitan and fairly close to the monorail.
-- The Miracle Mile shops are within the hotel - so it's easy to get to a convenience store or grab a snack.

The cons:
-- Old, old bathroom fixtures and peeling paint everywhere. 
-- The bathrooms especially don't look or feel clean enough and the rooms have a stale dry air - they haven't been vented for years. 
-- No coffee machines in the room - but that's a Vegas problem.
-- $13.99 per day for Wi-fi.",3,1,1

Finding the place if you're driving can be a pain, however - it took my boss 45 minutes just trying to figure out where to drive in for the lobby!

The lobby itself is not much to speak about -- hardly any place to sit, unless you think three very small benches is adequate. The check in staff were pleasant enough. Curbside staff were helpful. 

Room-wise, it is pretty dark. Unless you are staying in one of the suites -- we did have a party in one of those which had a fantastic view. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/planet-hollywood-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-2?select=QWK7FTtIHE2fSJWdJuTJ0A#QWK7FTtIHE2fSJWdJuTJ0A The pillows are uncomfortably high. If you don't like firm pillows, you should bring your own, or roll up some towels. There is a small coffee maker, no fridge, I had to call up a hairdryer, but overall apart from the loud revelers who thought yelling at 3:00 am is acceptable right outside someone's room, it was a quiet room on the 12th floor. 

Conference facilities are on the mezzanine level where the Chapel is. Lots of weddings going on while I was there. In general, the conference food was good. It is expensive though! I suppose that's the case with most hotels on The Strip. For instance, I had to order wine & cheese for a workshop I was putting on. Get this, a baked brie for 25 people runs about $225.00, not including tax & gratuity. Ouch. 

WiFi is not free -- I believe it is $15 a day per device? Didn't bother checking out the gym, also heard that is not free. Nothing is! 

Despite the downside, I liked it. I had stayed at Bally's before which was a bit of a blah experience for me. This was the opposite. Loved the crystal lighting throughout. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/planet-hollywood-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-2?select=dWu2esICZ8ToW3geJ6kXsA#dWu2esICZ8ToW3geJ6kXsA

You do have the convenience of the Miracle Mile shops which is nice - don't even have to set food outside! There is also a PF Chang's in the casino area and a Starbucks.

They tried to check us out a day early which resulted in another trip to the lobby, not fun. The fire alarms where going off and nobody there seemed to mind which lead me to believe this happens a lot (false alarm).

Going back down to front desk to speak with the front desk we were informed they had no joining rooms available for the night and we would have to wait till Monday until one became available. Requested to speak with the manager and he was a total asshole. He said we were pretty much stuck with what we got as a room until Monday. What a damn shame.

Took it for the view. Got to the room and called bellhop. My friend went to use the bathroom and there was urine all over the seat. Called down and they said they could move us to another room but we had to still pay the upgrade fee, and come down to get the new keys. I told them I was over the upgrade and they said we had to go down to the front desk again. Bellman shows up.  Head down to front desk, bellman in tow and they change us to a regular room with two beds, or so I thought. Room had one bed and I called down to complain. Apparently they never had a room with two beds. Said we would be changed in the morning call at 9. Valet was painfully slow. We barely made our cirque show at mirage.  

In morning called down, nothing. We had to get ready for the show and still no call by 3 pm.  Headed out  and the housekeeper said aren't you supposed to be changing rooms? Headed to the first part of our night and headed back to room. Still no call. Headed back down for event at the AXIS and the AXIS was spouting off incorrect information regarding event and then headed back to the room and decided to call down again. The room had already been changed and they wondered why we weren't in the new room but they had notes that no one had called us. Asked for the bellhop to be sent up immediately since we had to be back at the AXIS at 730 pm, he upgraded the room to an 100 extra square feet and it took 45 minutes to get the bellman up. The new room had tape on the ceiling and clothing stickers everywhere and the tv was disconnected. As we were leaving, we realized the door didn't close from the outside. We made it work, and called when we got back about the TV and tape and door. Maintenance took care of the TV and then said the lock had to be replaced and they would do it tomorrow at noon. 

Tomorrow comes and nothing. Again we had to get to a show and no one came so we went out to our show and when we got back, our door was open. Apparently housekeeping came and took SOME of the tape off the ceiling but didn't realize the door didn't work and our room was open for hours. They came up and replaced the lock and I took down the rest of the tape, housekeeping that day left us with absolutely no toilet paper as well. 

Sunday was going well, but we discovered a table in our room that was supposed to light up, was broken. We then went out for Sunday's festivities. We were so happy, flying high, came to the room and our keys had been deactivated. Down the stairs we went and got new keys. Totally deflated our night. 

In the morning we got room service with a room credit they gave us. When I went to check out, the front desk said I had to pay for the room service service charge and I said no I don't and the manager reversed it and we left, or so i thought.

I requested my hotel bills a couple days after returning home.  I was appalled at what happened.  First off, this room was prepaid through a third party.  On the bill, the first night was a charge for the upgrade of the room, that we had already said we didn't want.  They didn't refund the credit card, they just credited my account for the $250.  Everything else was on the up and up, except at the end there was a $15.10 room service charge.  I called Planet Hollywood and they said there was no way they could have refunded that charge because it was gratuity.  I am upset because the manager who checked us out said, don't worry about it, you have a $0 bill.  Now they have that manager calling me back, even though they have told me nothing can be done.

In all fairness, I was told nothing could be done to the room price because I booked through a third party.  I was issued a $50 food credit at the end of the second night, and a $75 credit on the last night.  Also 2 comped 2 WiFi devices at around midnight the last night of our stay (which gave us maybe 4 hours of use, if you account for sleep time.) But I am still appalled at how much time I wasted on my trip on dealing with room problems. The whole thing could have been solved by just moving us to a different upgraded room and not charging the upgrade fees.

Buffet was nothing to write home about, valet was super slow (even the valet said, ""wow you've been waiting a long time!) at various times not just at rush hours, bell service was the best thing at this hotel.",5,0,0

The reason why I like Planet Hollywood a lot is because..
1. It's located right in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip.
2. The shopping center had stores that were more of my style and price range (H&M, Metro Park, DC Shoes, Gap, etc.)

Apryl and I arrived very early to check in. The front desk woman checked us in and asked us to return in an hour to get our room keys. When we came back, our room was clean and ready to go. 

We had a deal where we got a free bottle of alcohol for each night we were there. Both Apryl and I figured that there had to be some catch to the deal, since it seemed too good to be true. Nope. No catch at all. Each day, after we woke up, we headed down to the gift shop and grabbed a bottle (750mL) of SKYY vodka. We had brought mixers in our luggage to work with (Reese's Peanutbutter cups, spray can cheese and crackers too). All in all, we had unlimited drinks, plus another bottle to take home, the entire trip! 

We got the ""Roseanne"" room. F*ck, I hate that show! I wanted a cooler room. Like ""Hunt for Red October"" or ""True Lies""... Now that would have made it better. I disliked having a picture of Roseanne's fat face plastered in our bathroom. Severely disliked. I would have paid another $20 a night to have Sean Connery's mug keeping an eye on us while we bathed. 

The entire hotel is very trendy and hip. The renovation has made it into a completely different place. It's clean, bright and full of color. Definitely a very eye pleasing place without becoming gaudy or pretentious.

The boyfriend and I stayed here on a Friday night and while it didn't totally suck, we probably won't be staying again since its not really our scene. The PH is a total party hotel and a mostly 20 to 30-something crowd. There's always loud club music playing in throughout and the whole place has a general Hollywood Club feel. Awesome if you're into that sort of thing but the bf and I are more of the laid-back, dive bar type.

The parking structure is behind the Miracle Mile shops with the casino\/hotel attached to the other side of the mall, which means that you have to walk through the mall, into the casino and down a level to get to check-in. Quite a hike but not as terrible as I expected from reading other reviews.  As others have said, check in was pretty crazy. We arrived on a Friday at 1:30pm and decided to check in early. The line was already long and we waited about 20-25 minutes before even getting to check in. While long check-in lines are kind of the norm in Vegas, this was excessive, especially for 2 hours before actual check-in started. Once we got to actually check-in, the front desk girl checked us in while barely even talking to us and then gave us our key without saying anything about the free bottle we were supposed to get with the 'Drinks on Us' package that we booked. When we mentioned it, she said that we weren't booked for that and there was nothing we could do about it since it was booked through Hotels.com. Then, she refused to help any further since I forgot the booking number. Finally, after a few minutes of my searching my email on my phone unsuccessfully, she went and spoke to her manager and informed me she was giving me the special as if she was doing me some huge favor [hello, its called customer service - its your job, bitch]. The special is basically a coupon that you take to the gift shop and exchange for your choice of Skyy Vodka, Sauza Tequila or 2 mediocre wines [all ""valued"" at $40 or more according to PH but about $20-25 at any regular store].

The room is nice - we had a Hollywood Hip on the 7th floor overlooking some patio by the pool. Our room had a Bruce Lee theme, pretty cool as far as room themes go - I was a bit worried that we might get a horror theme, lol. The bed itself was fairly comfy but the pillows were SO uncomfortable...they were down pillows [I think] but not fluffy - more like the old, lumpy down - it had huge lumps that wouldn't flatten out with any amount of shaking\/fluffing. The bathroom is huge and awesome with an actual hair dryer instead of the wall-mount kind and the shower had killer water pressure with a separate water-jet tub that we didn't get to try but wish we had.

The casino is pretty cool, lots of fun lights everywhere and good slots\/table games. There's a 'Pleasure Pit' area with bikini-clad dancers dancing on a runway type thing in the middle. There's also the 'Heart Bar' the center which is kind of a club lounge that has a dj playing at night. Overall, it was nice, but a bit more club-y than we're into and we got kind of over the constantly bumping club music [no variety, all club music].

Miracle Mile shops were the shit - besides the fact that there are some awesome stores, there's a Fat Tuesday and you can drink in the mall and go in 90% of the stores with your booze - makes for looser spending and a boyfriend that is a lot happier to walk around shopping with you - every woman's dream! I will say though that the mall is not as big as I expected but still awesome.

The food was alright though we tried Earl of Sandwich, which a lot of reviews mention, and didn't really like it. The sandwiches were alright but not nearly as spectacular as we expected and not somewhere we would ever eat again.

Overall, the PH is cool and just the place to go if your into the hipster party scene and looking to club it up the whole time you're there. If you, like us, are more into the laid back dive bar scene, this isn't really the place for you.",0,0,0

For my second visit to Vegas we booked Planet Hollywood seeing as it was more central than when I stayed at Treasure Island and the price was also good.  Our flight from Toronto arrived into Vegas pretty late.  By the time we got to the hotel it was around 11pm.  We were with a group of 6 people so when checking in we wanted to stay at least on the same floor.  Seeing as it was late check out that was not possible.  To speed up the check in process we split up and spoke to 3 different reps at the check in counter.  They were extremely friendly and willing to change our rooms the next day so that we were closer together.  The person we were speaking with whispered to my wife and I and said you may not want to switch when you see the room you are getting.  She did not say much more which left me wondering.  She began to hand us over a whole bunch of vouchers for amenities in the hotel along with $15.00 to spend each day at Starbucks.  That alone was enough to make me happy especially when we were not complaining about anything.  We began to approach the elevator and I looked to see what floor we were on and it said the 52nd floor.  My mind began to wonder as to what I was to expect being that high up.  Once I was in the elevator I realized that the 52nd floor was the penthouse.  My mind began to wonder even further.  Once the elevator arrived and the doors opened the hallways were extremely fancy with even black velvet on the walls.  Not knowing what to expect we opened the door to our room and there it was.  What ever my mind was expecting was not this.  First off its not a room its a CONDO lol.  I think I will let the pictures do it justice as I cant begin to explain how nice the room was and the view was priceless.  

Other than the room the hotel itself was pretty big and had everything you need.  Many things for entertainment and lots of food choices.  The pools were clean and well situated.  The cabanas were fair priced and came with unlimited water and fruit.  Nice touch. 

Although I know that if I ever come back to Planet Hollywood I will not have the same experience with the penthouse suite but this experience will make me forever love Planet Hollywood and every time I go to Vegas Planet Hollywood will be the first place that I will look up.

The location is perfectly in the middle of the strip across from Cosmopolitan and there are the Miracle Mile Shops located inside plus Starbucks, Earl of Sandwich, and many other restaurants.  

My first interaction with Planet Hollywood was over the phone when I tried to book my room for a lower rate.  I booked it early in advance and I saw a price drop on their website so I decided to call them to see if they could honor the summer promotion offer.  They gladly offered it to me for even cheaper than the website rate and they were SO nice about it!  I received a confirmation email within minutes of the phone call and I always felt like a valued guest over the phone, which is kind of rare nowadays with any kind of customer service.  

Upon arriving in Las Vegas, it was slightly confusing finding the valet parking area\/entrance to the lobby, but we made it there in one piece.  We stayed in the Hollywood Hip room with two queen beds.  The bathroom was huge, but a downside is there are not enough outlets in the room especially near the big mirror in the hallway to allow us to get ready efficiently. 

Also, the pool situation is kind of awkward.  There are two pools located on opposite ends.  Not sure if this is the case for other hotels on the strip or not, but if you want to lounge near the pool, you have to pay for a bed or a cabana all day.

One bad incident with the front desk. I popped out to empty the trash, because no one came to clean the room. The key card didn't work as I came back so I got locked out. I had no ID with me. Went to the front desk for help. She told me to go back up, there'll be security to assist me in the room to get my ID.  Waited over 5 mins no one came so I went back down feeling annoyed. The lady called Tetcha pointed a finger at me because I appeared and sounded frustrated -- who wouldn't?!?! 

She said she didn't know how long I would have to wait, and she didn't like the way I acted frustrated, because she's front desk, had nothing to do with it.  So I asked to speak to the manager.

The manager came though he was equally as bad. Though at least he didn't point a finger at me. 

Long story short, the staff don't seem to be caring and understanding and they seem to be lacking of customer service and knowledge. It's just a job for them and they put no effort and certainly no heart to what they do. Shame on them!",1,0,0

Cant comment on the casino or the restaurants cause I spent time at other casinos, even went swimming at another hotel\/casino after the first day because the pool was not where we wanted to spend our day.

PROS
GREAT location on the strip.
GREAT casino.
Very clean, modern, nice sized rooms, comfy bed.
MILE-long shopping!
Fun themed hotel rooms (I got Empire Records).
I had a nice view of the Bellagio fountain show from my room.
Great service.
THE BEST music, both poolside and in the casino on the strip (in my opinion) if you want to feel like you're in a club but gamble or be pool-side instead.

CONS (these are minor cons, the pros far outweigh the cons).
bad water pressure in shower.
no fridge.
I didn't like the pool setup-- there are only about 20 chairs poolside and the rest aren't even within view of the pool. They should add a pool in the center, this set-up just doesn't make sense to me. Also the young kid working the snack bar was too busy hiding in the corner talking on his phone to wait on my friend & I.

All in all, I think that Planet Hollywood is a great place to stay, especially for a younger crowd. The casino is very, very cool (very eye-catching!) and very big. It's always hoppin'. The mile long shops are awesome, and the rooms were great for the price. I would love to stay here again in the future, and I would be curious to see some of the other themed rooms!!",1,0,0

Modern, remodeled rooms.
Reasonably and somewhat cheap rooms. 
Comfy Pillows
Great location.
There is a mall in the hotel.
A lot of people, but not too many. Good amount.
$40 free gaming credit (if you are staying for multiple nights, sign up each night under other people's names, so that you get $40 per night)
Other coupons
Free bottle of alcohol (decent stuff too)
No resort fees

CONS
Really long check in.
Extremely rude night housekeeping staff (asked for shower gel, reply was ""we don't have that."" our reply, ""but we have some with PH in our room""...silence...)
Lack of $10 tables during the day time.
No real poker room, so you end up smelling very strongly of smoke since people just have to step on the other side of the ropes.

I love how they have good music, high energy, dancers on tables, people yelling, all without being TOO trashy or dirty! 

I stayed here a couple of times and I must say, the people at the desk are really friendly depending on how you play it out.  I read previous reviews about the $20 trick for an upgrade and it TOTALLY worked! They hooked me up with a suite and it was niceeee!

The room can use a little updating.  Even in the suites it looks like it needs a little bit of work.  But for the price and location, you really can't complain.

The main reason why I like staying at Planet is the location! Right across from the Cosmo, Aria and Bellagio and right next to the Paris hotel. I'm within walking distances from pretty much all the good hotels on the strip so if I ever feel like eating or playing anywhere else, I can just make a quick walk across the bridge.

I also love the fact the Planet is connected to the Miracle Mile so if there's anything that you need, you can just walk around and find it in the mall!

As we settled in and explored we realized that there was really nothing notable about the property.  After visiting other hotels we couldn't help but feel like we should have stayed somewhere else because of the sheer magnitude of the architecture and decor of the other places.

Upon arrival there was a line at check in. It moved pretty quickly. It was Saturday afternoon, so this was expected.

The young lady at the check in desk greeted me. I asked if I could possibly get a complimentary strip view upgrade. She said yes! Very cool!! We headed upstairs and noticed she put us right by the elevators and ice machine. Ice machine didn't work. I called maintenance and the ice machine was repaired immediately. 

The room was not impressive at all. Very small and the window was also very small. Nice view, but you had to stick your head against the glass to see it. Half the lights in the room didn't even work. There was no fridge. We had the Jurassic Park theme room. The lights in the cases where the movie props were also burned out. The room was dark, even with the shades wide open.

PH rooms are always expensive. Even the smallest one. Probably because of thier great location on the strip. Thier rooms definitely need to be updated badly.

On the plus side, the room included free coffee and a coffee maker. The soaps were actually good size bars and there were plenty of towels. Bathroom was really nice for a small room.",0,0,0

I used to frequent this hotel often and over the last couple of years the hotel has gone downhill. The rooms are in serious need of renovation. When we first got there our sink wouldn't drain. We called maintenance and they said they would fix it. We still had the same issue even after they came. It also seemed as though the rest of our stay the room had a constant smell to it. At one point, when we returned from dinner, our bathroom floor was covered in water. We couldn't figure out if it was the tub, the shower or the toilet. Not to mention the grout in the shower was mismatched as if they just put grout in places that was missing chunks. 
When we went to the adult pool area on Sunday where we paid for a day bed. There was no one to tell us where to go or if there was even a server. When we first walked up to the pool area you could tell it hadn't been cleaned, at all. It was DISGUSTING. There were empty beer cans and plastic cups everywhere. There were even bottle caps and cups at the bottom of the pool. When we finally chose a day bed we waited 15 minutes before a server finally came around and told us we would be better off moving to a different bed because they were short handed (information that would have been useful when we paid for the day bed). Once we moved beds we found that the safe to the second bed didn't lock. We were constantly having to watch our stuff. We paid for a day bed for a reason. After being there for maybe 2 hours (most spent out of the disgusting pool) we were over it and left.

Averaging 3 trips a year to Sin City,  for the past 5 years, definitely makes me well versed in all things Vegas.  So when my friend decided to have his bachelor party in Vegas, I was stoked.  I'm always looking for an excuse to go... and when I found out we were going to be staying at Planet Hollywood... they didn't need to ask if I was going, just tell me when and I'm there.  

Stayed from Wednesday to Sunday.  I know I know... that's an eternity for Vegas. Typically, two days and three nights is more then enough; any longer, and you'll be burnt out.  By Friday I was pretty much fried... mainly from all the drinking sunup to sundown.  Anyways, I'm getting off the topic.  

Here are it's Good Points:

** Planet Hollywood is a decent size casino by Vegas standards. Even though they have only two mini-baccarat  tables, a table minimum of $25 for a weekend was fairly priced.   If mini-bacc is not your game, all your usual table games are there for as low as $5 min.

** After taking over the former Aladdin, they've really given this place a face lift .  I love the crystal chandelier from the lobby escalator.  Catered definitely to the younger crowd, this place exudes a lot of energy.  A good amount of traffic inside the casino.

** Positioned centrally on the ""Strip"".  A definite plus, saves you on cab fare.

** There's a mall... provides plenty of shopping and cheap food court eateries.  Trust me, after 5 days here... I needed it.

Now here's the Bad:

** The standard rooms are over 450 sgft (good size for Vegas).  Linens are nice but I'm not a big fan of purple (yuck!).  That's the theme color at this place.  Each room has an article of clothing from an actual movie that's encased and displayed.  Mine happen to be the dress from the Exorcist... not good, not good all.  Creeped me out.  We also booked a suite.  It had an air hockey table... big plus.  Problem was the low ceilings and again, the purple decor.  What made this a negative for me was the price (average daily rate: little over $200).  During that time-frame, I could've stayed on a nicer property like Palazzo or The Hotel @ Mandalay for the less.  Oh well, ultimately we all wanted to stay in the same Hotel.  All-in-all, the accommodations has more good points then bad, it's more of personal reasons for me... 

** Their Pleasure Pit, a designated table game area with scantily clad girls dancing on stripper poles, is a uglier version of the Pussy Cat Doll lounge @ Caesars.  The girls are really not that ugly, just not as attractive compared to PCD lounge or Playboy Club.  If you're going to rip-off an idea... you gotta make it nicer.

** Since they do have a night club (Prive) here, you get the drunks and obnoxious folks after 1:30 roaming the casino floor.

** Don't have any fine dining restaurants, except for the Strip House.

** Outside of the mall, there's no real attraction or landmark.  For example: Bellagio has the Fountains and the Conservatory, Mirage has the Volcano, Wynn has the light show, etc. 

** Their comping system is very slow and lacking.  When someone plays a minimum of $100 a hand and average about $300.  One would think you can get things right away especially when times are hard and you're starving for big players.  Granted we're no whales, but when I ask for something simple as having my cigarettes comped.  It took the pit boss over 30 minutes later to approve.  Took the the cocktail waitress another 20 minutes to get it.  BAD, VERY VERY BAD!  Also the pit boss was rarely rating the players.  Played for 3 hours at the table, the dealer had to apologize after she saw our disgust.  I never have this problem at Bellagio or MGM, I get it w\/in two minutes.  They definitely need to improve their customer service or they'll never have any committed gamblers.  

All-in-all, it's a good property.  More then likely I won't ever stay here again, especially after dropping a couple of g's here w\/o reaping anything.  Decided to spend the rest of my gambling money at Bellagio.  Planet is on par with properties that cater to young folks like the Palms and Hard Rock.  Modern and contemporary everything.  So if you want something centrally located with plenty of cheap eateries then Planet Hollywood is a safe bet.   Just don't gamble here.",7,5,7

The pool area is great, but in the busy season, the pools are a zoo. Lots of people and only so much space around the pools. 

They have a nice selection of restaurants and are attached to the Miracle Mile Shops which is an added bonus. The location is great if you like walking the strip. If you rent a car or have a car to valet, that gets interesting as the location of the garage in comparison to heavy traffic.",0,0,0

The room was nice enough, some things had some wear and in need of updating but overall the room was OK for the money.

There are 2 SMALL rectangle pools on the 6th floor with10X more concrete than there is pool and they are ICE COLD!. There is a reason there are no pictures of the pool on their website.

I certainly didn't expect that hotel in the USA is following the foul business practice of airlines.  The casino is just average since it is surrounded by fierce competitors who can easily out do this mediocre resort.  Since it was booked through bookit.com, I couldn't refuse the room and check out since the penalty is 100%.  I've decided to opt out of all amenities such as spas and restaurants since I was quite dismay of the poor business practice and I have NO doubt in my mind that  that they will add a mandatory gratuity to your bill if you happen to use their spas and other services.

The set-up of the hotel might be a little confusing. Check-In is hidden on the bottom floor and the only way to get there is on elevators\/escalator hidden in the Casino. 
The first room we stayed in was nice, it was Baywatch themed, it had two costumes, which I thought was pretty cool. The Baywatch bathing suit on the way had a light which was a nice plus, but the table case with the other costume light was broken, which was a little disappointing. The view was fine, nothing to rave about. I heard the hotel was the Aladdin previous, which might explain why the bathroom sinks like a magic lamp. The rooms also look dated, especially for a hotel that opened around 2007. The hallways look awesome with the nice carpet and then you open the doors to a dated room, that looks kind of like an older Best Western. The second room we got, I cant remember the theme, but it was a little big and pretty much the same as the first room - but the bath tub wouldn't drain - which I also saw a complaint about on here. The table case light was also broken in this room, so it seems like they're probably all broken. We got the room for a great deal, so that's what made it seem better. The beds are also a little hard. But overall, I had a nice time, I just wish it was a little nicer for how much the hotel usually is (for an extra day it would of been about $134 on Tuesday, but we paid about $70 a night - including the resort fee using a discount site).
The Miracle Mile is also located in the hotel, so if you don't feel like walking far to get something to eat, you can always grab something down stairs, but beware that the prices are at least $2 more. But it's still a nice place to walk around.

Things I liked: It's mid-strip, which is a great launch point for exploration. Our room (Ultra Hip with 2 queens) was modern and clean with a large bathroom. The Miracle Mile Shops are attached and have tons of shopping choices. It was easy to get in and out via Uber because the vehicle entrance isn't on the strip. The hotel was quiet. And, it was relatively cheap! 

Things I didn't like: Everywhere including our room had a constant, mild smoky smell (not a higher prevalence of smokers here, but I wonder about ventilation). The toiletries weren't great. The pool was easily the worst compared to other hotels we explored. PH doesn't host any of the super compelling\/classic food or entertainment experiences.

1. I forgot that if you self park you have to awkwardly walk through the miracle mile shops. That in itself with luggage adds a good 10-15 mins before actually getting inside the casino.

2. I forgot that it's hard to find landmarks to figure out how to get to the escalators or elevators to get to the lobby. Which means awkwardly walking around the casino for another 5-10 mins before finding an employee to ask how to get to registration.

3. Registration line took forever. I checked-in online and still waited for 30 mins...pretty pointless.

4. The room was pretty disgusting. It felt like a seedy motel as opposed to the 'hip' room it's supposed to be. The furniture was dinged up and in a weird setup nonetheless. The carpet made my feet dirty after walking on it barefoot...gross, so gross.

5. I was interested in ordering room service, but there was no hotel information book with a menu (that is generally standard for Vegas hotels). 

6. I tried to check out on my T.V., but it wouldn't even turn on...had to call and leave a message through their system to check out.

The ones here don't seem to give a crap about creating raving fans and returning guests.... Especially the Sports Book bartenders. They just seem to expect a 20-25% tip for nothing.

Customer service was top shelf from Valet to checkout. Wifi is FREE for up to two devices (after you pay resort fees) also, great view of the strip. 




The casino, lobby situation can be a little overwhelming at first. But once you use landmarks to remember how you get around, you'll be good. Our landmark was the Britney wheel to get back to the hotel lobby. Minor complaint about the rumor, and I do mean minor! The shower took about 8-10minutes to get remotely warm. 

We also ordered room service. Wasn't terrible. We ordered the Sunset Strips and Chicken sandwich. Both were delicious. Waiter was very nice and knew both my name and my wife's when he came in.

We had rooms at Flamingo but our VIP host found rooms a Planet that saved us about $80 and since this was my daughters original choice we switched hotels.  We got in very late so the hotel was full, the front desk clerk said he had two dbl queen rooms, or a suite that we would have to move from in two days or gave us the option of changing in the morning after checkouts.  We figured if we're spending more than 6 hrs in our room we should be beaten with a tack hammer anyway so we just kept our rooms. 
Rooms: very easy to find, clean and roomy, not much of a view, large bathroom and pretty quiet. Maid service was great.
Casino:  layout is a bit confusing, lots of walking in circles but that could be attributed to the drinks, they definitely aren't going to cheat you hear.  I do enjoy their sports book.  Actually being able to sit in the bar\/lounge and watch all your games is nice and the bartenders are great.  Sat down for a few hours while the ladies shopped and grabbed a nap.

After finding a parking spot, I go check in and didn't realize how long of a walk it was just to get to the lobby since I had to walk by a bunch of shops to get to the casino and then make my way downstairs.

After checking in and getting to my room I took a look around and saw it wasn't too shabby. There was movie memorabilia and a good sized TV. I didn't like that the bathroom had 2 doors on it. Also the water from the showerhead came out pretty weak. The bathtub was decent sized but I didn't use it. The beds weren't that comfortable and made too much squeaky noises.

The view from the room was alright but the window was really dirty and had a lot of water spots on it.

The casino area was decent. I like playing slots so there were a good amount of games to choose from but they didn't have certain ones like other casinos. The payouts here are terrible though.

Aside from the longass walk from the parking lot to the room, my first night I went to the shop outside the casino near the south elevators to ask for directions for BurGR. The rude female employee told me there's an info booth which I didn't see it and brushed me away with a rude tone.

I have to say this was the absolute worst hotel experience.... EVER ( And no I am not be over dramatic). ok, fine, i will give it 1\/16 of a star for the pricing, which should have been an indicator of what was to come. 

Lets start off by saying there is absolutely no point to look on their website to judge what your room experience may be. That would be a complete waste of your time. The website does not resemble to room at all. First, the room is completely depressing, barely any lighting and really big, dark furniture. Don't expect to cover up with a cozy comforter, oh that's right, you just get a sheet to cover up with. So at night ( during the peak of summer) you can either sleep with your AC and freeze, or turn it low or off and toss and turn all night b\/c your so freaking hot. 

Ladies, don't plan on straightening your hair (which we all know if an absolute essential). That would just be too much to ask. Why you wonder. Well, the moment I plugged in my small straightener, the breaker went off and the bathroom went dark... TWICE and as a result my expensive beauty essential went dead. I made a claim with the hotel and after sending a security guard (WTF) to my room, I was told that the hotel was not at fault and I was just going to have to deal.

The nicest part of the room, I reckon, would be the bathroom... if you like to find a cockroach waiting for you in the morning as you walk into the shower...... seriously!

Wont get to deep with my review, but here are some things you should know before booking here.

Arrived on a Sunday night and stayed unit Tuesday morning. For what I paid it was a pretty good deal. Employees were very nice, the hotel room was a decent size, clean room and nice bathroom. But the biggest problem to me was the parking. When you 1st arrive you can pull up to the valet, drop off your bags and go check in. But the problem with this hotel compared to others is that the ""self parking"" garage is located in the mall, which is connected to the Planet Hollywood and the walk to and from the casino to the parking garage is maybe about a 1\/4 mile walk. So it can be very inconvenient when you have to park in the garage.  So you would think that parking in the complementary valet area would solve that problem and it does, however if and when the valet is full, you have to park in the ""self parking"" garage. Valet seemed not to be full during the day but if you drove off and returned closer to the evening expect to be taking a long walk back to your room.  The gaming area is okay, kind of small to other casinos and not a lot of variety with the slot machines. Food selection is not that great either but I highly recommend eating at Gordon Ramseys restaurant ""Burgr"". Excellent place to eat!! Other than that a decent stay but not something I want to go through again. I would recommend look else where unless your on a budget and can get this place at a low rate.",2,1,1

Now, about the hotel: during check in, the line started getting long (about 20 or so couples\/families). That's when 1 of the 2 employees at the check in desks decided to disappear. It took us 45 minutes to check in and we were 2nd in line. The elevators were extremely scuffed up to the point that it just looked broken and unsafe because the ceiling was tilted and visibly shaking. Our room door wouldn't close all the way unless you pulled on the handle using the force of your whole body. The window in the room looked like a prison window because it was only maybe 4x4. We had paid for the resort package, which includes free internet on 2 devices. Not once did the ""internet""work for us anywhere on the premises, and they charged us for a mysterious 3rd device that showed up in our room. Half the towels in the bathroom had weird brown stains on them and they looked like they had never been washed and just folded and placed back in the bathroom. 

Now, onto the casino. Some of the dealers were incredibly rude. For example, when checking my ID, they would throw it back towards me instead of just handing it back or placing it on the table like normal people. When trying to make small talk to make everyone's time a little more interesting, a few of the female dealers just glared back with a ""why are you talking to me"" look on their faces. If they hate working there that much and hate people, don't work in a job that requires you to make human interactions. Some dealers even glared at those at the table who did not tip them when they hadn't even won anything or a significant amount. Lastly, many of the tables were definitely and very obviously rigged. I understand that gambling is about chance but there are some strategies to it. When the strats never work and every consistently go against it, you know that it's rigged, which is what happened here. Not saying this because I lost a lot or anything, because I didn't. Just saying that because it was so obvious and they were eating money for no reason. I have had no problems like these at treasure island, aria, bellagio, or the Venetian. Be fair to your patrons.

We asked he front desk and they said all they could do was spray the room because the ventilation is shared and it's hard to find out where it comes from.  We asked hem to leave the bottle so we could spray every few hours and apparently they can't because a kid may drink the liquid.  We don't have kids in our room.  

The wifi in our room has full bars but every 3-5minutes it stops working even though you still have full bars and haven't physically moved, requiring you to dis\/reconnect or navigate to a URL you have never visited to trick it to authenticate again.  3-5 minutes from now you will need to do the same thing, and pick a different\/new URL.  The front desk sent us to their wifi team to manually connect which we sat on hold for a while and then decided to move on with life.  

If we had reasonable cell service wifi wouldn't have been important but Even Verizon only had 1 bar of basically unusable lte (sometimes 4 bars of 3G).",0,0,0

There was still hair in the bathtub, and nasty yellow stains near the hand rail that I had to take a towel and wipe it off.  And of course, while doing that,  I find a pubic hair!!!  EWWWW!!  I don't know why I didn't take a picture of that or called down to complain for that matter.  I wiped it up with the towel and threw it in the corner of the bathroom floor.

If you are twenty Something or early thirties, On a budget- yet have enough money for shopping and trip to Vegas, this may be for you. Seriously, I felt like I was in a sea of people all my own age! A refreshing change from the 40 and 50 year old gambling crowd that you get at many casinos- though of course there is some of that here too- but certainly still a younger crowd.

This hotel features trendy decor in the rooms with Hollywood themes (mine was the movie Aliens and Bill Paxton was inside my coffee table!). Convienence is also key because PH is almost smack in the middle of the strip, affording opportunities to explore on foot (especially the exciting new city center, which has two awesome clubs so far, Haze and Eve). 

I didn't take note of any fine dining opportunities as the group I was with wanted to go to PF Chang's China Bistro, however, I got the feeling that this hotel was not built for fine dining compared to say, The Wynn, Bellagio, Mandalay Bay or MGM... It is much smaller than other Vegas resorts and consequently does not house a major theatrical production on the scale of Cirque Du Soliel. This is a great place to spend a weekend in Vegas if you want easy access to the clubs, a place to crash, and perhaps meet an attractive someone in the Casino.",3,0,1

The rooms were amazingly affordable. We even upgraded for $20\/ night for a room with a view, and we were very happy that we did. We stayed on the 50th floor of the 51 floor building. The view was outstanding, you could see the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio water show, and an amazing view of the strip.The accommodations were nice and clean and very comfortable. 

It's so nice having a mall underneath you. On the first day I stopped to get my hair done immediately after checking in, because unfortunately the one thing I had forgot to pack was my hair straightener and I wanted to look good for a night on the town. Luckily there was a salon in the mall. It was so convenient having what I needed right downstairs.

Another plus is that it's in a good location from everything else on the strip. Everything's in pretty much walking distance.

My only complaint is no free wifi for guests, but you can always stop downstairs at the Starbucks for it if you like.

Pros:
- Visually, the theme, hotel and casino as a whole look nice.
- If you smoke, you'll have no problems with the rooms.

Cons:
- We had reservations for a non-smoking room. When we checked in, they had absolutely no smoke-free rooms left even though we made reservations for a non-smoking room months in advance. So we were stuck with a disgusting\/stinky room. Although the room had Brad Pitt photos all over the walls, it wasn't enough to make up for the smoke saturated room and smoke filtering in from the rooms next door. 

The next morning we went to the front desk and I insisted we get switched to a non-smoking room, and possibly get comped for having such a horrible 1st night. The guy at the desk avoided me the whole time, but did change our room, without any comps.

SERVICE: I'm VERY disappointed with the service I received here. For the price that I paid, I expected way more. We booked a room that had 2 beds (2 months in advance for my friends 21st bi-day) because there was 4 people staying in the room, when we got there they gave us a room with one bed because they were ""sold out"" of the 2 bed rooms. So, they expected me to cramp 4 people into one bed, and be satisfied with that! I called 3 times to make sure I was given that room! These people kept telling me yes! After I got back, and tell them that it's BS they gave me a room with 2 beds (magically opened up) with no fridge. I didn't care at this point, just wanted my room with two beds. 

PARKING: is too far from the casino. Had heavy luggage and ended up with a back pain. 

INTERNET: You have to pay for it -another disappointment, even Circus Circus has free Wi-FI (wtf)

- The vibe.  The place attracts a younger crowd that has a lot of energy.

- Bars & Lounges.  They have a wide variety of bars and lounges.  On a recent visit we spent some time at the Heart Bar....a DJ was playing and the drinks were reasonable....$8 for a glass of Wine.

- Miracle Mile Shopping mall.  This mall is pretty cool with some unique shops and dining options.  The Earl of Sandwich is at the South end of the mall.....one of my favorite Sandwich shops in town.

- Restaurants.  From cheap, food court type food to nice sit-down restaurants, there is something for everyone here.  One of the highlights is Pink's from Los Angeles which is known for their Hot Dogs.

- Easy access to the Strip.  The distance between the property and the Strip is short, making it easy to get to\/from the Strip.

There are a few negatives to the place......the parking situation sucks.  The parking garage is at the rear of the property and the walk to the casino is pretty far.  Valet parking is underground and is also a big pain the ass.  This is a function of very poor design which has plagued this hotel since they opened.  The layout of the casino floor is very confusing....it's difficult to figure out where you are located and how to get around.  The mall is a little confusing as well.

The past weekend my Fiancé and I stayed at PH (Sat-Mon). We did the online check in which was nice and we didn't have to wait in the line we just picked up our keys and went up to the room. 

The room was basic, a little on the small side but the bathroom was large so that made up for it. We settled in and I hopped in the shower. As soon as I got out there was an overwhelming smell of pot in the bathroom. It smelled like somebody was smoking it IN THE ROOM. We debated for a moment and decided that the smell was too much to deal with. I called concierge and nobody picked up, so I called the front desk who transferred me to security. Unfortunately I don't remember the gentleman's name but he told me that it was a ""pretty common thing"" and there was ""nothing they could do"". He wouldn't even come up and walk the floor! He did tell me that if it was really bothering me I could call the front desk and they might be able to move me if the hotel isn't booked.

Now I don't expect security to come up and bang on every door to see who was smoking the pot (on a non-smoking floor by the way). But was it too much to ask the walk the floor a little and make your presence known? We ended up not moving rooms as we had already unpacked and settled into this room and were only staying 2 nights. We did open the vent and keep the bathroom door closed (the smell was only coming from the bathroom vents). The smell stayed at varying degrees until Sunday evening. 

Because of how security handled my concerns I will no longer be staying the PH. I am having my wedding in Vegas in March and will be encouraging all of our wedding guests to stay elsewhere.

From the outside looking in I liked the vibe and the dealers at night at the Pleasure Pit. The sports book has multiple tvs and the bar is right behind it so that's convenient.

However, the experience is different when staying here. Checking in was a breeze via online so I'll give it +1 star for that. The rooms try to look nice with movie props like a Hard Rock Cafe so it gets +1 more star.

Now for the cons. Whoever designed the buildings made it so that you can hear the water pipes when another room turns them on. This gave a rude awakening multiple times while sleeping in during the morning. Once awaken it was hard to fall back asleep!
Next, the lighting in the cabinets didn't work. Without lighting, it was impossible to see inside the closet to hang clothes. The room as it is has little lighting except for one ceiling light and 3 standing lamps.

The TV gets over 60 channels but only 4 related to sports. The rest are a mix of advertisement, basic cable, and foreign channels. 

Our bathroom had a broken toilet seat cover, pretty embarrassing. The rooms also don't have a fridge so forget bringing back perishable foods or drinks that need to be chilled.

Here is the part that made me the most mad. Twice the dealers almost screwed our party out of money. When buying in the dealer spread the hundreds on the table and counted wrong. I knew because I counted prior to heading to the casino ow much I would buy in. I had to correct her before she realized or I would have lost money already. Then when my buddy cashed out, the dealer stacked the chips and shorted him 100. Clearly the stacks of black chips were not even and 100 more protruded out. What is worse is the floor stood right behind her and said nothing as she handed out the pink chips. We had to call her out on the missing 100. Mistakes like this shouldn't be made when it comes to counting, coloring, and dispensing chips. 

Unless the room is complementary, Planet Hollywood is Planet Mediocre. Beware your chips as well",3,1,1

I described the outfit to him and he put me on hold, came back, and said he found one skirt, one top, and ""a pair of dirty panties"". First of all - was that really necessary????  I was so taken aback.  A pair of underwear would have been sufficient.  Anyway, whatever.  I was glad they had my stuff and asked him to please send the items back to me.  Because the room was under my husbands name he had to send an email to Lost & Found to release the outfit.  I waiting several days and never heard anything so I called Anthony again and he said I should get an email with the articles listed and I would pay a $20 shipping charge.  Exorbitant price, in my opinion, but again...whatever.  I just wanted my outfit back.  I waited for about 2 weeks and never got anything in the mail.

A while ago I had a very bad experience at PH - room not ready, told type of room paid for not available so bait-and-switch to lower class room, room in bad repair, etc. This was during a holiday when the regular folks who run the Diamond Desk were likely off. Manager eventually made things better - mysteriously found that an upgraded room was ""now available"" - gave one free night (out of 6) for the ""misunderstanding""  - etc. I said thanks and the management including the sales dept assured me to expect better things next time. 

WELL NEXT TIME HAPPENED and guess what? For the 2nd time in a row I was not provided a free upgrade (I am a meeting planner and co-sponsored a major convention there along with separate meeting plus doubled my credit line). OK so I do not spend much time in my room so big deal? Not when wall paper is peeling from the walls, dust is literally building up in the corners of the furniture, everything is banged up, light bulbs are out, etc. At the very least -0 no matter qhat hotel it is - I STILL WANT A CLEAN ROOM IN GOOD REPAIR!

Further more no one takes their Total Rewards card anymore - no points to be given or taken - no discounts - not even their gift shop or own restaurant (Planet Dailies - BARF AVOID AT ALL COSTS - EVERYONE IN MY GROUP HAD TUMMY ISSUES AFTER EATING THERE AND SOME ARE STILL SICK). I spent ZERO in the casino because of these issues and we are very seriously looking at one of the MGM properties for our convention \/ meetings next time (Aria is GREAT BTW). 

I have stayed at a Caesar's owned property 10 times out of the last 12 times in Vegas (over the last 8 years or so) - brought 9 major events \/ meetings \/ conferences there.

The pool area was a little  undesirable, the 21 and over pool only had 28 chairs available and there was well over 100 people out there, most people were forced to sit or lay down far away from the pool area and another section or rent an expensive Cabana.

After getting nowhere with her we requested to be moved to a room where we could walk up the stairs to as we did not feel safe in the elevators.  4 hours later we get a call after attending our work event and she said they were fixing the elevators and would move us to our new rooms. We were then escorted to our rooms. The security guard, Mr. Angelo was very nice and told us where the nearest exit was to walk down the stairs. After they left, we went down two stairwells and were trapped with no exit.  We then waited 18 minutes for security. We have still not received any information on what happened to elevator and were only comped one night stay for our troubles. In light of resent events, I would not deem this a safe hotel and the utter disregard for our safety and what we experienced was atrocious. I travel to Vegas a lot and will never return to this hotel.",1,1,0

Overall it was a great experience. We had a room on the top floor of one of the ""wings"" (these sections go up to floor 23) with an awesome view of the strip and the mountain in the distance. Like other people have said, the rooms are kind of dark, but it wasn't the end of the world. The bathroom was HUGE and well lit. There was a shower, large tub, and plenty of counter space. There was also a huge mirror on the wall outside of the bathroom, which was great for getting ready to go out. Beds were comfy and I didn't have any trouble sleeping. We were on a pretty quiet floor, so noise wasn't an issue, and the only traffic you could hear was the occasional siren or horn. 

Of all the hotels\/casinos we went in, the Plant Hollywood was my favorite. The casino ceilings are high, so it didn't have the claustrophobic feeling I got in other places. The music is loud and upbeat, which I love, but get how that can be annoying to some people. The whole place was super young and fun, which is exactly what we were hoping for. 

The location is awesome, right in the middle of the strip. It's attached to the Miracle Mile shops, which were fun to walk around in, and it's right across from the Bellagio so you're in prime position to watch the fountains. The pool deck (6th floor) has an awesome view of the Eiffel Tower next door. 

We ate at the Earl of Sandwich quite a bit because the food was good and it was cheap in terms of Vegas. Drinks at Heart Bar were pretty pricey (we spent $23 for two drinks here, and $18 for the same thing at Hard Rock). Par for the course, but still painful. Never made it up to the club here, despite being handed wrist bands three different times. Maybe next trip. 

Overall it was a really great hotel experience. The staff was very nice and accommodating, rooms were great, atmosphere was great and location was great. Would totally stay here again.",1,0,0

I was deciding between PH or MGM to stay for my birthday week celebration and reading reviews as well as considering location, I went with PH (plus the price was a bit cheaper than MGM). 

Upon arrival, the valet helped us right away with our car & luggage. We waited in line for about 10 minutes for registration. We got a woman, named Lorena I believe, who was helpful. We were though hoping for an upgrade because my boyfriend and I were both celebrating our birthdays but unfortunately she couldn't help us. She got our room ready and informed us we should wait until 3pm for no early check in fees, so we waited & hit up chipotlé in the miracle mile. 

It got to be about 10 to 3p so we headed back to the registration desk. A man, named Joel, helped us get our keys and was the sweetest man you'll meet there. He was very helpful and even upgraded us when the other woman couldn't. We were so grateful and ready to begin our birthday trip! 

We arrived at our room (Resort Room 2070) and I was pleasantly surprised it was by the elevator, glad I didn't have to walk to far for our room! We enter and there's a semi large entrance, large bathroom included 2 sinks, 2 vanities, a large shower, enclosed toilet area, and soaking tub. We had a view of the fountain in a mediocre room. Nothing too special about it; again it wasn't nice but wasn't horrible. 

PROS:
Location, mall downstairs was helpful, taxi service was quick, & 2 different starbucks locations in the hotel. 

CONS:
The table that displayed out rooms theme was unfortunately was broken, the soaking tub handle was broken, the toilet paper holder was broken, one of the lamps next to the bed wasn't plugged in, there were 2 phones and only one worked, services such as bellhop, pillows did have a weird smell to them, housekeeping, & front desk took multiple calls for someone to actually attend to you. 

Everything in my cons list, I had read before in previous posts but I didn't take them too seriously. If you really don't mind those things then it's a great place to stay. Its right in the middle of everything. When I was able to interact with the staff they were friendly and eager to help. 

Overall my opinion would be stay there if you won't be in the room enough to care about the imperfections but if you are someone like me who cares, than stay elsewhere.",0,0,0

The staff is excellent!  Friendly and accommodating.  And I see...or hear they toned down that loud music in the casino.  Thank goodness last time here my ears were bleeding.  

I love it here why stay anywhere else?  We went to Aria today and hey, though it's beautiful and smells delicious, the casino is sucky I swear they pipe in crowd noise with the vanilla essence. The casino was empty and I can see why. Hubby put a hundred in a new quarter slot machine, bet his max and the bet was $90!!!!!! I miss the days of the one armed bandit.

I tried to do the ""$20 tip trick"" (if you don't know what that is then google it) on the check in lady.. but I used $100 instead because I really wanted a suite. The girl sincerely tried her hardest, but they were really out. I ended up giving her a $20 anyways for trying, and she did upgrade our room from whatever we originally booked. 

Tried to call the front desk to ask for a roll in bed, and had to wait 15 minutes before anyone picked up the phone (this was near 3-4AM btw... when it's not so busy in the front).

Next day called the front desk to ask for a water boiler or hot water so we can make cup noodles (don't judge, we were hung over, lazy, and too tired to leave the room).. Anyways, had to wait another 15 minutes before anyone picked up the phone, then the lady tells us it will be $6 bucks and we will have to wait 2 hours for it... the hell?? Then we just asked for a coffee maker (which is usually standard in most other hotel rooms), and she transferred us to housekeeping, where we waited another 15 minutes for someone to pick up the phone, only to tell us that there aren't anymore. I just want some effing cup noodles man. 

My advice: the location is great, but this hotel honestly sucks. It's dirty and needs some serious renovation. Best part about this hotel is Earl Sandwich.",2,2,2

I got a deal on Planet Hollywood (via Yelp -- stay two nights, get the third free!), and so that's where I spent my anniversary with the wife. I was impressed.

The hotel itself is vanilla on the outside -- nothing as dramatic as the NYNY skyline or the pomo pretensions of Luxor. Inside, the eye candy gets nicer, if still basic. The aesthetic is slick modernity, the type that appeals to your average young twentysomething -- judicious use of black, walls and chandeliers that change color, etc. After a Keanu-esque ""whoa"" at the pretty lights, you don't really ogle the architecture much. On the other hand, the hotel *does* seem to attract mostly young twenty-somethings, which seriously cuts down on the number of small children. As a firm believer that most of Vegas is not for kids, this was a plus.

Check-in, sometime between 6-7PM, was speedy, and we got a room overlooking the Bellagio fountains (fantastic view, and much better than heading across the street to see 'em ""up close,"" IMHO). The staff was friendly and professional, giving us vouchers for bottles of free booze and letting us temporarily park in a reserved limo spot when we overshot the waiting area.

re: parking, as other reviews have noted, it is a hike from the hotel to the parking garage. On the other hand, I've never been a fan of driving anywhere on the Strip; it's not worth the hassle. And the PH location is *gold.* From PH, it's a pleasant 10-20 minute walk to any hotel on the Strip worth entering. No wasted gas, no exorbitant cab fees... just a nice stroll to wherever you need to go.

As if that weren't nice already, PH is fantastically well laid out on the inside. As cool as Caesars Palace was, I have ghastly memories of getting from X point in the hotel or Forum Shops back up to my room -- endless interlocking corridors seemingly stretching forever. Not so in PH. You can get from your room to almost any other point in the hotel, casino, or Miracle Mile within five minutes. The design is highly efficient and centralized, and made the stay much more enjoyable.

In terms of quality, the rooms were exactly as expected for the price range -- average size, big comfy bed, huge tub, huge TV, awesome view, clean as a whistle. No marble tubs, penthouse-sized suites, or anything like that. Again, though, I hope PH is paying their designers well, because the room made superb use of what it was given -- never felt undersized or underequipped, and the design was slick, well-lit, and modern. Each room is themed around a particular actor or movie. Ours was Bruce Willis in ""Sunset,"" and had the jacket and shoes Willis wore in the movie. It was a cute, Vegas-kitsch touch that I enjoyed.

This leads to the only significant complaint I have about PH as a hotel: it's thematically weak compared with other hotels in Vegas. Paris has the Eiffel Tower, a boulevard, L'Arc de Triomphe, etc. Mandalay Bay has waterfalls, temples, a shark aquarium, and so on for most Vegas hotels. PH has... lots of flat-screen TVs looping footage of the same half-dozen celebs. PH lacks the escapist eye candy that's the hallmark of Vegas. It would've been nice to see even a modest exhibition of Hollywood memorabilia or some such. It's disappointing when your room is better themed than the entire hotel. Even the rooms remind you that PH doesn't have much escapism other than gambling, since a selling point is that you get to look at another hotel's cool stuff (Bellagio fountains). :P Maybe I'm being unfair, since the Miracle Mile does have a bunch of cool Middle Eastern architecture left over from the Aladdin remodel, but I'm not counting that as PH-themed.

That aside, though, PH does have one big draw: restaurants. For the low-to-middling budget, PH offers quite a bit of bang for the buck in the form of Lombardi's (Italian), Yolos (Mexican), and Earl of Sandwich (guess :P), as Yelp will attest. The PH restaurants have the singular honor of being the only places to eat on the Strip where I didn't feel ripped off.

Quibbles about theme aside, PH is an excellent value for the price range and considerably exceeded my expectations. I'd definitely stay here again.

Pro:

-Location, location, location.
-Efficient layout saves your sore feet.
-Professional and friendly staff all over the place.
-Clean, well-designed, stylish, and comfortable rooms.
-Slick modern aesthetics.
-Lowest ratio of kids-to-adults observed on the Strip.
-The attached shops and restaurants are also a cut above Vegas average.
-Decently priced.
-Free booze!

Con:

-Less value if you're paying full price (but if you're in Vegas and paying full price, you're either stupid or ignorant. :P).
-Long walk to parking, if you actually enjoy driving in Vegas.
-Not enough to do\/see consistent with the theme, so expect to be staying (and probably eating) at PH but doing the cool stuff at other hotels.
-Surprisingly blah swimming pool.",1,0,0

I mean, I am taking some sort of vacation.  And since I don't gamble my relaxation comes in the form of a pool.  So imagine my disappointment upon entry into what they call the pool area...

Bleck.  It was just so sparse.  Lots of concrete.  Not inviting or visually pleasing in the least.  If you're lucky enough to grab one of only about 20 chairs by the pool good for you!  The pool, which ironically is called ""The Pleasure Pool"" is anything but pleasurable in my opinion.  Plus, to top it off, the actual pool is frigid!  I'm positive it wasn't heated and even though it was 80 degrees out, I probably could have caught hypothermia if I stayed in there longer than a minute.  

They also have to be losing tons of money on the pool bar.  The service is just awful.  There's three bars in the area but only one was open.  The line was always 20ish people deep and took forever.  If you were lucky enough to find a server they'd take at least a half an hour to get you your drink.  It was not a pleasurable pool experience!

I will say the rooms are nice.  The bed was comfy and the bathroom was ginormous!  There was a great soaking tub and a stand up shower.  I do wish there were ledges in the shower because shaving was pretty difficult.  They also have a separate potty room, which is always helpful if you happen to be a bathroom hog (or staying with a bathroom hog)!  

Every room has a themed movie poster and props.  Ours was some random Sylvester Stallone movie we'd never heard of called Daylight.  I assume the better rooms or suites have cooler memorabilia, but it wasn't anything I'd dock stars for... Although I may add more stars if I had a Paul Rudd room!  

I'm not much of a gambler, so the casino doesn't do much for me (I know, I'm in Vegas and I don't gamble, I'm a weirdo!).  I feel like each casino comes with a different vibe to it and this one gets a younger crowd for sure.  I still don't like that you can smoke in the casino and you can definitely tell their ventilator system wasn't the best.  

So since I'm not a gambler, I come to shop, see shows and eat!  One of the main reasons I picked the hotel was because it was attached to the Miracle Mile Mall!  It's a great mall with affordable shopping (not like the Crystals Mall across the street with mega high end stores).  There's also a plethora of restaurants attached to the hotel that are decent.  

Just a little side note, Peep Show is in this hotel.  We saw it last time we were in Vegas (kinda inspired us to stay here!) and it was an amazing time!  Although I wouldn't recommend staying here because of the show, it's worth it to stop in and walk through if you're going to the show.  

We stayed at Aria the last go round in Vegas and I'd definitely stay there over PH again just for the pool alone!",6,2,3

I was pleasantly surprised.  The rooms are still alladin but everything else is remodeled.  We were able to check in at 10:30, but got a ""smoking optinal room"" that didnt smell like smoke.  The staff was very nice - from the bell staff that received my flowers to the business center.

We got a pretty awesome deal and decided on PH because of it's location. The hotel is right in the middle of the strip and very convenient to access. It's right across the street from the Bellagio as well, so if you enjoy their water fountain show (as we do), it's quite handy! 

When checking in that night (around 11pm), the service was great and quick. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and answered all of my questions. She hooked us up with a slightly larger room with a view as well, and we were quite excited. Our room was the ""Hip Room with Strip View"" I believe. It had 1 king bed and lots of space, a giant soaker tub, and two sinks in the bathroom. We both really liked the room. 

The property itself is great as it is connected to a bunch of shops and restaurants. It can get confusing at times to find the best entrance\/exit, but we were able to figure that out on our second day there. Just outside of the casino, there is also a Tix4Tonight stand, which is quite handy for people who want to find cheap show and dinner deals.

A few downsides: one of the bathroom sinks kept clogging up, even when we used it the first time to simply wash our hands. It wasn't a big deal as we had two sinks so we just stuck to using the one that didn't clog up. Secondly, the resort fees are expensive. Even if you get a great room deal, that is usually negated by the $32USD\/night resort fee. 

All things considered, I would stay here again.",1,0,0

I love the lighting everywhere, I love that there is go go dancers dancing near the game tables, Miracle Miles mall is cool, Prive is nice, and the food selection is pretty good too. However, I am not happy with the Front Desk staff, except one person.  I checked in with my friend's brother who had another room. And I used the sandwich trick of throwing in 40 dollars between my credit card and my id. So I pass that onto Jamie, the front desk agent, hoping for an upgrade. They claim that we have been upgraded, but I don't understand why my friend's brother, who didn't tip at all gets a much bigger room with plenty of windows with an amazing view. I specifically remember Jamie saying that we were both getting big rooms, an extra 100 sq feet.  Our room was tiny, and we are girls. And you know how much space girls need to get ready every night. We like to throw our makeup, clothes, and shoes everywhere. Plus the television was broken. It isn't the biggest deal in the world, but how can you take someone's tip, and give someone else who didn't tip an upgrade? So I called the front desk from the room, and the guy said I had come downstairs and had talk to Jamie about that. The person on the phone also didn't even know who Jamie was, he kept calling her a him. I don't understand why he couldn't move us himself. I've worked at a hotel front desk staff, so I know he could have moved me easily, and sent up new keys. However he didn't, he just argued with me. So I went downstairs, and Adam was the nicest person to me at the front desk. He easily upgraded us, no questions asked, and all he said was ""I want you to have a good time"". It could have been so easy, yet some people make it so hard. Other than that, the place is great, but don't always expect a nice upgrade with the sandwich trick.",1,1,0

It's also attached to the Miracle Mile Mall, which was very convenient.  The price for this resort is average for Vegas. We got a Fountains view room, which had a pretty good view of the Bellagio Fountains. Although the windows were dirty, so taking pictures from the room wasn't much good. All the rooms at PH are movie themed, which means each room had memorabilia from a specific movie. Even though I had a great view, the theme was from the worst movie ever: Super Mario Brothers. I had a big ass picture of John Leguizamo and Bob Hoskins over the tub. Also, the room could use a little touch ups; it's a little dated.  This place used to be The Aladdin before switching to Planet Hollywood in 2007. The structure is the same so some of the designs are still have the old theme. The Mandra Spa still has an Arabic theme. Also, it's not advertised on the website, but there is a fitness center within the Mandra Spa that is available to guests at no extra fee. I used it and they give you a wrist band that's good for that day, so you can go and leave as you want without having to check in. Also, there is free Wi-Fi, but it's kind of a pain in the ass, because you have to keep renewing it every 24 hours. The pool area is on the 6th floor.  There are three separate pools and a whirlpool.  Nothing really great here.  

I didn't catch any of the shows offered by PH; there was Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez and Crazy Girls, which is a topless review.  But we did see the women taking photo ops with guests (the Crazy Girls, not Britney or J-Lo).  The casino is pretty good. On Saturday night, it gets really jumping. There is an area called The Pleasure Pit, in which the dealers are hot women in lingerie and there are also hot women dancing on top of the tables. Nice eye candy, but nothing eye popping.  One thing I noticed about the casino area is all the hookers trolling the floor looking for the next John. They aren't too obvious but they will definitely let you know if you're looking for that. They really make their presence known late night. It gets really annoying when you're trying to hook up at the bar and you can't tell which women are legit and which are pros.  

The restaurants are pretty good.  The standout here is Gordon Ramsey's Burgr.  It's pricy and it's a long wait but the food is outstanding.  There's a 24 hr place called Planet Dailies. This place has a surprisingly good menu to choose from, especially at 4 am, but be prepared for the obnoxious drunks looking to grab a bite.  If you want something quick to take up to your room, there is Earl of Sandwich, also open 24hrs. Not the best, but it's quick and cheap(er).  There are also places attached to the Miracle Mile Mall; Sammy Hagar's Cabo Wabo, Bubba Gump Shrimp, PBR Rock Bar and Grill, Pin Up Pizza are the standouts. Also, there is a 24hr Walgreens attached to the mall that you can access by walking around the front exit. This place is really convenient for everything you might need, including booze. 
Overall, this is a great party spot, because there are so many options and it's dead center of the strip; walking distance from other party areas.",0,0,0

With the change to Planet Hollywood, each room is Hollywood themed with black and red décor, making the room sort of dark.

Since this spring, they've been renovating the rooms and the room I stayed in for my June trip was in one of the renovated ones, now called Ultra Hip (the pre-renovation room is called Hollywood Hip). This makeover now makes the room look more modern with more natural light coming in, making it less dark than the prior décor. I like this change and prefer this look over its predecessor. 

I didn't look for their fitness center, so I don't know where it is. The pools, however, are a skippable amenity for me. We wanted to hit the pools before our room was ready and headed there once we got a dummy key from the front desk. There are two pools, one with a live DJ playing and mostly for adults, and another that's more kid-friendly, but both were packed on Friday afternoon and both had little shade! The walk from the entrance to the pools is mostly rows of lounge chairs and cabanas and even here, it seemed like you're walking through the desert (no shade) to get to the pools. 

Entrance to parking is off of Harmon Ave, which I love because you don't have to fight with the traffic struggles of Las Vegas Blvd. You can also enter\/exit off Audrie Street, though it's not as obvious an entrance as on Harmon. Parking at Planet Hollywood is still free so far! Woohoo!

Their $35 resort fee covers wifi, fitness center access for 2, and local calls.

I love its central location on the strip and you can't beat the location if you're in town to watch a show at the Axis theater! It was so convenient to walk down for food around Miracle Mile before a show, go back up to the room to enjoy the food with TV, come back down to see the Backstreet Boys at the Axis without having to account for time to travel along Las Vegas Blvd and park a car, and go back up right after with minimal walking!",2,0,0

General comments: Self-parking in the garage requires a 10 minute walk through the casino and mall which is totally inconvenient. Definitely drop your stuff off and then park your car. Keep in mind they charge a $22\/day ""resort"" fee (no, your room fee doesn't include this...) for wifi on 2 devices, 2 passes to the gym, and local calls. They value this at something like $70(?) per day which is outrageous. Also, if you have four guests in your room, shouldn't they all be able to use the gym? BS if you ask me. 

Bathroom: The shower felt like one I've used at the gym (straight down to the tile), and I honestly questioned if I was at risk for athlete's foot. Plus the long blonde hairs stuck to the wall (we both have black hair...) was rather troubling. There's a separate tub which is nice. The door to the toilet wouldn't close. The counter for the sink was large and big enough for two (but there was only one sink). The towels were rough, thinning, and desperately need to be replaced.

Bedroom: The furniture is covered in nicks and scratches. The beds look motel status, can't splurge for some nicer pillows? One nice touch is that the comforter is covered in a sheet they change regularly (I assume). The TV is old, but has a good number of channels. The blackout curtain lacked a chain, so it was incapable of moving up or down. I had to call maintenance 3 times, waiting over an hour, for them to come up and fix it. 

While the casino and mall are decent, they in no way make up for the mediocrity of the actual hotel. There are plenty of nicer hotels on the Strip with better service and amenities for the same (if not cheaper) price. I definitely won't be returning.",1,0,0

The beds were comfy and the bathroom was amazing and roomy, we even had a bathtub party with 3 girls, myself included. ;D For a room just to sleep in, its not too bad but I'm sure there are better places to stay at.

First off the atmosphere is totally Vegas with loud music pumping from the time you walk in the doors and all throughout the casino as well. All of the hotel staff I encountered were friendly and the Planet Dailies coffee shop had AWESOME food for being a 24-7 coffee shop restaurant.

The casino is always alive and kicking with music from a live DJ at the adjacent lounge. My favorite part of the casino was the pleasure pit where all the dealers are smoking hot girls in lingerie and they have pole dancers behind the dealers. Keep in mind fellow Yelpers I am a single male at the time I am writing this review  =)

The location of this hotel is center strip where the majority of the action is and all the rooms are movie themed rooms with movie memorabilia. We had the Jim Carrey themed room with memorabilia from the Cable Guy, Batman Forever, and the Mask.

The beds in the room and comfy and the bathroom was decent sized. In general the room was very clean.

The only reason I gave this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is because the room we were in had no water pressure in the shower so it took like 20 minutes to shower. I am sure it is not the case with every room and I wasn't tripping about it because we only stayed for the weekend plus I wasn't paying for the room. 

When I come to Vegas again I would definitely consider staying here again.",1,0,0

I've been to Vegas 4 times or more this year, working various music events. This time out I was attending the Route 91 Festival. I had got tickets and a hotel room at Mandalay Bay from a friend who had planned on heading back home on Sunday, so I needed to find a room for Sunday night if I wanted to stay. I thought I'd give Planet Hollywood a shot since I hadn't stayed there in a few years since I had stayed at Harrahs, the Flamingo and a new favorite the Linq. I had booked my room through hotels.com since I had earned a several free stays. I had tried to cancel the booking at Planet Hollywood since the rest of my friends and family were staying at Mandalay Bay. Planet Hollywood wouldn't let me cancel the booking, but Hotels.com was super kind on their end, which I won't go into details about, but I ended up keeping the reservation at Planet Hollywood since they wouldn't let us cancel it, but I also booked a room at Mandalay Bay. Then, the shooting happens at the Route 91 Festival. I loose my friends amongst the panic and decide to stay and try to help those who needed it. I eventually ended up walking to Planet Hollywood (I'll leave out the other details) to check into the room I wasn't able to cancel, since Mandalay Bay was locked down. You'd almost think it was meant to be right? Well, I check in around 4am explaining that my phone had died so I wasn't able to call them to let them know I was still coming but was curious if my reservation was still there. The desk guy says yes once I give him the confirmation number and he asks for my card (I'm thinking its for accidentals and deposit, etc.). Maybe it was the state of mind I was in after the event that went down, but I don't recall him ever saying I would be charged for the room or that they rent going to honor the hotels.com booking.

Next day I go to check out over the phone since their escalator downstairs was broken. I wonder back to Mandalay Bay to collect my things. It took me three phone calls to check out of my room. The first time they asked me for all my info...just to tell me inhad to call another number... But that number was the same one I just called... They eventually tell me that my card was charged $179 for the room. I let them know that I had booked it through Hotels.com and that it was already paid for. They said I would need to contact Hotels.com. I contact Hotels.com and their customer service, for the second time is awesome, when Planet Hollywood didn't seem to care. 

Thank you Hotels.com for stepping up when you could have just pointed the blame at Planet Hollywood. I don't think I'll be staying at another Caesars or Harrahs property any time soon.

The rest of Las Vegas and the community really stepped up to accommodate those in need and even those that didn't even know they would be.",2,1,0

In long: We used priceline.com's name your own price, and got it for $60 on Thursday. In future if priceline won't hook it up, they offer a 10% off or so with AAA just fyi.

With a cheap hotel in mind I wasn't expecting much. And boy was I impressed (this is based on the checking in\/out) and the rooms alone (aka I didn't really use the casino much but I did chill in one of the bars in the middle of the casino which was nice). 

The room was SO SO nice. We got the Jim Carrey themed room so we had some paraphernalia from his movie in our room, so that set a pretty sweet mood. The beds were super big and super comfy. The room and bathroom were super spacey and super prestine, we felt like high rollers. There was also a 42inch or so flat screen tv with lots and lots of channels too, which was awesome. 

So we went to the pool area and it SUCKED. It was this huggggggge area with terrible planning- the left and right most areas had decent sized, sort of boring pools (though the left one was closed) and then there was this HUGE area between the two just for tanning. I guess I understand a lot of people like to tan, but we all felt that it'd be much nicer if they flipped it and had a huge pool in the middle and tanning all around it. We were all pretty unimpressed. They played like top 40 on low volume in the background too. I guess I'd call it bland.

BUT just in case someone really needs a pool or tanning area and you're staying at a shittier place or one without a pool or tanning area, they don't card you at all to get in and out.

All in all, a great, great experience- I'd definitely stay here from now on.",0,0,0

From check-in to check-out I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  My girlfriend and I stayed here for three nights on New Years weekend and had a pretty good experience.

We checked-in inside the VIP check-in counter.  There was complimentary water and beverages as well as snacks.  The check-in process was quick and the staff took care of all our belongings.  We stayed in one of Planet Hollywood's Panorama Suites.  The room was quite spacious.  The bed was very comfortable but the pillows were a bit on the stiff side.  There were your standard amenities such as a large TV, table, chairs, etc.  I don't think you'll have anything negative to say about the room.

Planet Hollywood is located relatively close to a lot of shopping areas.  Miracle Mile is right there if you're planning on doing some shopping.  There are a lot of shops and retailers inside Miracle Mile.  Within walking distance there are also a lot of other shopping destinations.  I really like staying at PH for this reason alone.

BurGR is also located right here in PH, the lines do get very long but if you're Seven Stars you can bypass the lines here.  Great perk!

Only downside is that the parking structure is quite a distance from the hotel if you do plan on doing self-parking.  Otherwise valet parking is your best bet here.",0,0,0

I think I have stayed at most places on the strip with the exception of a few and Planet Hollywood was one of them.  So when we planned a little unemployment vacation (yes myself and three other family members are currently without full time employment!) I decided to book a room here.  I have to tell you I loved the vibe.  It was very fun, young and the music just made you bop your head wherever you were in the hotel!

My family and I have a routine - which some will think is funny but oh well.  We rate places on a few criteria - 1. The pool, 2. How big the room and more importantly the bathroom is and 3. Can we do everything without leaving the hotel for the entire stay?  I would say Planet Hollywood gets 5 stars for this!  We all loved this place - the mall is an extra plus for the restaurants as we all know the casino restaurants are not cheap.

Our room was very nice - clean and it slept all 6 of us!!  LOL.  The pool was fantastic and we even had a star sighting - Ashanti was lounging by the pool right next to us in the VIP section.  Pool waitresses were very friendly and kept the drinks coming.  I would say the only thing was the pool temp - it was a bit cool but with hot weather I am sure they figure we can deal!!

Planet Hollywood has a cool hip scenester vibe. They play good tunes and have some good lounge acts playing throughout The Casino. My personal favorite area is of course The Pleasure Pit where girls dance in lingerie above the tables-gives you a little more bang for the buck that you're about to lose.
Once you get up to the rooms they're pretty much the same as all other rooms in Vegas. They're comfortable and come standard equipped. Each room also contains some item of memorabilia from a film or television show. I can now die fulfilled from having spent a night in the same room as a piece of the magic from the ""Alien Nation"" TV show that I never once watched.
If you're in Vegas and are paying that much attention to the room, you either have no clue how to have a good time or you're broke and have nothing else to do except wonder how in the hell ""Alien Nation"" EVER got made into a TV series. Now get your broke ass back down to The Pleasure Pit.",0,2,1

Well, the place really was not too bad.  I made sure we got a remodeled room and we actually had a view of the strip.  The location is great since you can walk to Paris or across the street to the Belagio.  However, this is where the plus ends. 

The casino itself is very smoky.  I know they smoke in all the casino's, but this place has such poor ventilation that the smoke is stagnant in the air and makes any allergies flair up.  This also goes into the rooms and makes it very difficult to sleep well.  The rooms look nice now that they are done, but it's Vegas.  Don't you want some special theme???  This reminds me of any nice hotel or bar in San Francisco or LA.  Why would I want to fly out to Vegas to feel like I'm in SF or LA??  I could just drive out to the city for the same experience.  The hotel decor was also kinda boring with no recognizable theme.  I suppose the impression I got was ""dot-com"".  Yeah, been there, done that, move on.  

So, if you are from Kansas or Nebraska and are looking for the feeling of the big city then this might be the place for you.

To begin, I stayed at Planet Hollywood in August last year for my 21st birthday. We picked it because it's in the middle of everything and across the street from Haze and Marquee, both of the clubs we were going to. We didn't have any major problems, but the rooms are not as nice as some of the other hotels.

I went with a group of four girls including myself, so we booked a room with two beds because no shit there's four of us. When we checked in, they gave us a room with one bed and the only room they had available with two beds was a smoking room. We thought no big deal, we're non smokers but we don't mind the smoke. But the smell of the room was fucking NASTY. I swear I would take a shower at night and have to take another one in the morning because the sheets stunk of stale cigarettes and boy does that smell stick to you. There is barely any light in the room, which is troublesome for girls who are putting make up on and doing their hair. The shower heads don't adjust, and we had girls ranging from 5'2""-5'9"" in our room. No coffee maker, microwave, or mini fridge, so don't expect to be able to stalk up on hangover food and cold water bottles. We had to walk our drunk\/hungover asses all the way down to Walgreens to buy cold water and affordable snacks. But whatever, we thought, ""hey we're here to party not to hang out in the hotel room"" so we didn't complain.

This year we decided to pick Planet Hollywood again, mostly because of its prime location and it being attached to the mall. BIG FUCKING MISTAKE! *deep breath* let me begin....

It was just three girls this time, including me. We get to Vegas Thursday night and check in. No problems this time getting our two bed room. We get upstairs and find a shit ton of problems. Our desk lamp was broken. Not that big of a deal but since there's already no light in the room to begin with it was definitely an issue. There were dead moths and other bugs in the corners of the room and under the beds. Our curtain didn't close so we would get woken up at the ass crack of dawn every morning by the sunlight. Our toilet would make these loud weird noises the entire night. We didn't have any cold water in our sink, so we brushed our teeth with hot water. 

Late Friday Night we tried to order room service and found we had no menu. We ended up having to call and ask them to read us their menu. We also had no paper or pen, which I thought was pretty standard at hotels. Early Saturday morning we called to have the sheets changed because we found stains on them.

Here comes the most fucked up part: 

Friday afternoon my friend got shitfaced and didn't feel good, so my other friend and I left her around 10pm to go out clubbing. I put all of our valuables in the safe and locked it. We returned around 4am to the room, I then unlocked the safe to get money out so we could get water and snacks at Walgreens. At this point my friend who was drunk was awake and sober, but stayed back in the room while I was downstairs. 

We returned to the room around 5:15-5:30am. I put the rest of my money back in my wallet and into the safe, but didn't lock it because we were in the room. We ate and went to sleep around 6:30am. Around 8:30am we were woken up by a phone call from the front desk saying housekeeping had found my friends' wallets on a room service tray on another floor from ours. While they were downstairs, I searched the room and found my wallet thrown into the corner of the room, the contents spilled out, and approx $200-$250 taken. I looked in the safe and found that my $300 Michael Kors watch was also taken. My friends also had their money taken, $250 from one and $360 from the other. My $150 hair straightener was in the safe but had not been taken. This means SOMEONE HAD TO HAVE COME INTO OUR ROOM WHILE WE WERE SLEEPING AND TOOK OUR STUFF. How fucking scary is that???

Security came and took our statements. They told us that risk management were the ones who investigated claims against the hotel and were the only ones who would upgrade us or get our weekend compensated. However, they are closed on the weekends which is a fucking joke because EVERYONE COMES TO VEGAS FOR THE WEEKENDS!

The main reason I'm so fucking pissed is not because our money was stolen, but the lack of security Planet Hollywood has for their guests. We were very lucky nothing else had happened to us while we were asleep and vulnerable. There are no security cameras in the hallways or stairs. You don't have to show your key or check in with someone to use the elevators, which means anyone from the streets can come up to the rooms. There are no security guards patrolling the hallways or stairs at night.

I ran out of room and there is a lot more details to my story. Long story short, don't stay here. It's unsafe and dirty.",0,1,0

Seven of us from elementary and middle school made the trip this year.  For the past 6 or 8 years, we always stayed at Bally's.  It was cheap, on the strip and had a big enough suite for us to kick back and hang.  Last year was the final straw.  The place was old and tired and the Sports Book was closed on Final Four weekend.

Planet Hollywood was a huge step up in quality but still reasonably priced.  Fabulous location on the strip.  Our suite was huge, decorated with Hollywood memorabilia, 180 degree windows overlooking Paris's Eiffel Tower and the fountains at Bellagio.

The place is laid out quite well.  They have lots of casino space, a groovy ""Pleasure Pit"" area with lingerie clad dancers, and a vibe similar to Hard Rock.  Oh, the pool area rocked!!

The room was immaculate and the view of the strip was outstanding. 
The bathroom was to die for. The bed was nice and comfy!!! 
The lighting inside the casino was absolutely stunning and the decor was very modern! The bar was nice and screens everywhere. There was even a nice view from the machines to watch the football game so that was a big plus! 
The miracle mile shops downstairs on the casino level with restaurants and bars are a major plus... It gets you away from the expensive vegas eating and shopping! 
CONS: check in was a hot mess! As there was only one lane open and about 15 guests waiting to be checked in! Then after the first day someone stole my boyfriends hair brush after the room was supposedly ""cleaned"". 
There was soap scum around the faucet head in the shower, rub and sink! That was HELLA gross! Yuck! Lol.

On first impression, I was a little disappointed to see that the colors and details were removed from what used to be the Aladdin.  Thus leaving the hotel to look a bit bland from the outside and minimalistic.

Upon walking into the hotel, I realized that they concentrated a lot of their efforts to ""glam"" the interior with crystals, special lighting and etc.  to cater to a young and hip crowd.

The hotel rooms are nice and are among the cheapest for it's location.  Still reflecting the Aladdin theme, the rooms are of nice Vegas standard.  Usually they are comparable in price with NYNY, but the rooms are much smaller at NYNY.  Besides having a plush room, you also a nice BIG bathroom that features a huge vanity sink area, shower and separate large tub.  This is PERFECT if you are going to be sharing a room with 4 girls!  Lots of bathroom space and comfortable sleeping quarters.

One of the things that PH took away from the Aladdin was the center stage cover bands.  These performers were always great and performed top 40 hits enjoyed by all.  It gave the casino floor a vibe and that has been lost with its departure.
 
One of the major improvement that I did notice to the hotel was the layout of the casino, parking entrance and registration.  The flow is MUCH better and requires less walking through the cobblestone mall.  It's more intuitive.  Way to go PH!

This is a great hotel to stay in if you plan to stay with a group of people for the space, bathroom size, price and location.

TIP: Hooray!  There is a really nice Starbuck's located here.  This is one of the few hotels that feature a Starbuck's.  This is a perfect spot to grab a quick breakfast, snack or water for your room!  They have a really nice seating area that is spacious.  If you don't like Starbuck's and need something stronger?  Look no further, LA's popular Coffee Bean is right around the corner in the mall.",0,0,0

PROS: 
(+) Location, Location, Location. Right in the middle of the strip, right across from the cosmopolitan, the Bellagio, and right next to the Eiffel Tower\/Paris hotel. 
(+) So many stores, restaurants, a huge casino, and lots of shows play at PH (Britney, Backstreet Boys etc.). You can honestly walk around the hotel for hours there is so much to do. 
(+) Rooms were quite nice and modern. 
(+) Most comfortable beds ever! We had a two queens in our room and it was heaven! 
(+) Quiet rooms! We honestly did not see\/hear anyone on our floor (31st) which was strange considering how popping the rest of the hotel was. But it was super nice to have a quiet getaway from the Vegas craziness. 
(+) Pool was fun and played good music (+21 pool at least! I think there was a day club too but we didn't go to it.) 

CONS: 
(-) Increase way-finding signage!! It felt like Planet Hollywood was impossible to get out of. Nothing like drunkenly walking around the mall\/casino for an hour because you can't find an elevator. 
(-) Expensive! Everything was an add-on in the hotel. There was no coffee machine in the room.. even Holiday Inns\/Embassy Suites have automatic coffee machines! Your only option was to go to the Starbucks which charge $5 for a tall black coffee (?!?!?!) Drinks at the bar are $18. However, this is probably just a complaint for the Strip as a whole, but the least PH could do is provide coffee in-room",2,2,1

My fiance and I arrived to strictly watch Britney Spears and decided to stay in Planet Hollywood since she is performing there. Never before have we stayed in PH and never will after such horrific experience. 

Let me start by saying that as soon as we came into the room I notice cum stains on my wall. YES GUYS YOUR READ IT RIGHT CUM STAINS. I called the receptionist to complain about it and she basically told me that is not possible. After arguing with her and asking her to come into my room and see it for herself she decided to call housekeeping to arrange a clean up. Housekeeping took forever to come. 

Next morning as I am getting ready in the bathroom to go out, I noticed a drop of water on my arm, I assumed that maybe the ventilation was bad in the bathroom and after I took a shower there was water on the ceiling, but the drops were coming in faster and faster, as I looked up I saw that the fire sprinkler was leaking and the floor was getting flooded. Making my way towards the room, almost slipping because of the wet floors I make a call to downstairs again, and to my surprise and why should have I expected anything more a rude receptionist picks up and stars arguing with me that it is impossible for anything to leak from the ceiling.At that point I had enough and ask to speak to the manager. The manager was also rude and told me that someone will be upstairs in 45-50 minutes, when I told him that the entire bathroom and room could be flooded by the time they are, he ""politely"" told me to put couple of towels on the floor. I asked for maintenance team to assist me with that task. The manager became very irritated and decided to tell me in ""polite words"" for me to do it like it is my job to make sure I do not slip on the floors and there room not to get flooded.

The location of the hotel is most ideal for us since there's quick walking access to our other gambling locations! Don't care much for the mall, but the Starbucks and coffee bean are a plus. 
We were there during the in house casino waterfall flood that occurred, but amongst the few minutes of chaos, the situation was under control quickly. We were playing at the craps table during that time and the dealers were calm, collected, and still made the experience fun. 
By the way, the craps dealers at this casino have always tried to make it a great experience for the players. Busy weekends most tables are at a higher limit but they'll drop it down at times. 
So, yes, there's some renovation happening which closes down the cafe, but trust me, you don't want to be eating with mold around you. Allow them to clean up and go to Earl's instead. Delish, fast, and fairly priced! 

Ultra hip room has been great. Funky but cool decor and we've never experienced an issue that traumatic as to date.

We had two comped nights from Caesar's Entertainment because of a bad experience at the Flamingo. One of the things that immediately impressed me, is that unlike a lot of the other places that we have stayed, there was actually enough people to check in the amount of guests in line. Susan checked us in, and was very patient, and helpful trying to figure out the situation with the comped room. The person who did the reservations forgot to put in their comp code and Susan had to be on the phone for about 25 minutes to straighten it out. Because of the wait, Susan gave us a free upgrade to the 50th floor, in one of their VIP rooms. 

The room, was amazing! We got the ""True Lies"" room, and it was decorated with memorabilia from the film. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom had a separate shower and a very deep tub, as well as a TV (which pleased the husband). Our view was amazing. We could see the Aria and Cosmopolitan all lit up, and if we sat in the window seat we could watch the fountains at the Bellagio going off.

Our service the entire time was great. I plan to stick to Planet Hollywood and Monte Carlo from now on for my vacation plans. We spend most of our time in the shops at Miracle Mile anyway, so being right there close to them was convenient. There are tons of places to eat within the resort and lots of shopping options. I would say this is one of the better places to stay for food and shopping options.

The only downfall to this hotel is their pools. The pools are disappointing. There are two, but the seating around the pools is only cabanas or sitting on the ground. They have a HUGE open area with lots of lounge chairs in a big section between the two pools, but you don't have a view of anything, and in August it's HOT!!! You want to sit by the pool. And it's kind of lame if you want to sit or lay down and still be where the action is. 

Overall, this was my best Vegas hotel stay ever. I will for sure be back.

After checking in, our room's trash wasn't even taken out, our complimentary water was half drunk, we had no soap, used towels, and old\/used shampoo and conditioner. WTH!?!?!? what kind of hotel leaves there rooms in this condition? i understand that its a holiday weekend and that they're busy, but this is basic housekeeping we're talking about. i never felt so disgusted while i was in the room.

The front desk person told us they didn't have any no smoking rooms available even though we had reserved one. They could upgrade us for $20 more per day. What a gimmick! We heard them use the same technique on several others as we were waiting in line. Not wanting a smoking room, we paid the extra $60 plus tax for three nights. At this price point, we would have considered other hotels. Next, we asked the check-in person if we could have a quiet room since I am a light sleeper. She said, 'I have assigned you a nice, quiet room on the 30th floor.' Well, our quiet room shared a wall with two elevators. The constant sound of the elevators was extremely loud in our room, so thanks for the nice, quiet room!

PH is not Caesar's on a lower scale and you wouldn't even think that Caesar's Entertainment would put their name on it.  That sentence is for anyone considering this hotel based upon it being in the Caesar family. Now with that being said, the check-in lobby is modest and quiet, no hustle and bustle at all.  This is because the lobby is on the lower level and not casino level. So when you get out of the cab and walk in, you don't feel like you have arrived in Vegas, it is very quiet.  I had no problem checking in.  When we got to the room, I could tell that it was cleaned in haste.  There were mirrored tops on the end tables and lets just say I could write my name in them.

Now on to Planet Hollywood, which is located on the strip right next to Paris Hotel. If you are Total Rewards card member they are part of the TR program and many times you are able to get special room rates. This casino is on the bigger side of Harrah's but smaller than Cesar's. You have everything here from your slot machines to gambling tables my favorite being Black Jack. 

If you are looking for entertainment there is no shortage there, did you know they host America's Got Talent? I wish I was there when they were doing this show I love AGT. I have to say that the vibe is pumping with a very hip crowd and when you gamble there it doesn't have that intense feeling but more of a club like feel to it. The people are of the younger crowd so you can imagine the noise level is a bit higher but again the vibe is like a night club. 

They also feature many restaurants from upscale to medium fan fair to quick bite places like Starbucks. As a TR Member I am sure in the future I will go and stay at PH because it is closer to my son's school and closer to the nightclubs but that is when my BFF's and I are ready to party without having to stay in and entertain my son which he only has 2 years left before he goes clubbing, without me :} LOL",17,17,19

We had to lug our stuff all the way to our room before we saw that we were stuck in a king room. We had to lug our stuff back down because the phone didn't work in the room, and we couldn't call the front desk. When we walked back down, Miles assured us we could move the next day, but we were stuck in the king for the night. I asked for a rollaway. He said they were sold out. 

Knowing Miles wasn't good for much, I spoke with Royce. He was friendly, but also said the queen rooms were sold out. Royce checked, but found no history that we were supposed to be moved to a better room the next day. He did notate it, however, and get me a rollaway. Sold out, huh? Guess not!

Got a queen room the next day: vomit on the door, hair dryer broken, remote didn't work, leak in the bathroom, broken shower head and chipped furniture. 

Redeeming factors: Royce & Techa at the front desk were stellar, & the housekeeping staff was friendly (although didn't seem to notice the vomit on the door?!?). The casino was also very nice.

We always come earlier than the check in time maybe that's why I've never had to wait in a line like the other reviewers. I have never had a problem with the rooms here everything is always clean and smells great. 

Housekeeping cleans up the room with no problem and replenishes the supplies. The pool on the rooftop is great because of the great views.The casino downstairs has a good selection of games and there are always waitresses to give you drinks. 

If you are in your 20's and came to vegas to party and want to feel like you are living well in vegas, this hotel is one of the better hotels on the strip but of course it's not a place of luxury like the cosmo, bellagio etc.  Most of all it does not smell like smoke! 

I think the key is to arrive earlier than the check in time so you avoid the masses of people and get your room quickly with no hassle and have a great time and also check out using the TV instead of going downstairs and waiting in line.
I have stayed here during the weekend and the weekdays and they always have room to valet if you say you are a hotel guest.",1,0,0

The bad: the room is old, not enough light, don't even have a coffee machine for us to boil water. Hot water in the shower takes forever to heat up. One of the cabinet doors fell apart right after we checked in and started to inspect the room.

The ugly: we asked for repair to the door and explicitly told them we would not be around the whole day so please came by to fix it. NO ONE came when we got back @ 11pm. And we found out there was no housekeeping done as well! Called and complained and after 20 min no one showed up, we called once more and they came to cleaned the garbage and gave us new towels, etc. after another 10 min. Also there are $20 resort fee which I had no ideas about.

The theme is different, it's more for the younger crowd who like club like atmospheres. Our room had a movie theme to it with a couple pictures and ornamentation. The location of the hotel is great and is definitely right in the middle of everything on the strip, location wise it's an A+. It's easy to get around walking and there's walk ways connecting all the blocks. 

I would give them a 4 star because of service and location but the 3-stars is due to room quality and getting a smoking room when we requested a non-smoking one. We had to stay in it one night as we requested to have our room changed as soon as possible then they moved us up to the 8th floor the next day. 

We kept requesting a nicer room especially for spending $$$ for 3 nights on NYE weekend. and we just wanted something just a little nicer and were supposed to get one on the 25th floor but later said we didn't get it after telling us we could have it. Had we gotten a non-smoking room and a nicer room that was mentioned to us, it would have been a perfect stay.  You want to ask for the red room and better, the others are worn and tired. I've been to Las Vegas many times and the room was a bit pricey and under par for the measure. However we had a good time going to shows and experiencing NYE on the strip and nice restaurants in town.

The parking is very confusing, we had trouble just finding the valet but the service and staff were top notch. They are nice, friendly, and helpful.

Food: The Mexican restaurant inside PH is pretty good, the Sunday Champagne Brunch is excellent and costs about $32 per person. The normal buffet is around $20 and the breakfast one is just OK, however their dinner buffet has gotten some good review, we didn't eat there though. We visited some really nice restaurants around town. There's also a burger restaurant that has Gordon Ramsey's name inside and a Starbucks in the lobby and upstairs. There's also a couple other eateries inside as well as the shopping mall.

Planet Hollywood also opens up into the Miracle Mile shopping center, lots of shops, some good art galleries, it's great you can get in there directly from the casino. They are also part of Pet Stay so are pet friendly.

Overall a good location, mediocre rooms for the price albeit we were there on a busy weekend. We ended up at other hotels more often and spent more time away from the hotel than in it.",3,0,0

Friends to celebrate a BIG 30th bday. We went on a weekend. The first day we were woken up by screaming babies that were staying next door to us. Mind you we didn't complain. Also we were rudely interrupted by window cleaners that morning also.

The second night we all wanted to pre-party. We had everyone come to our room for some drinks. We were celebrating and having fun getting ready. There was a knock on our door. It was security saying there had been noise complaints and we need to keep it down. IT WAS A SATURDAY NIGHT AND IT WAS ONLY 8pm!!!!

I went on all the major travel sites trying to find the best cheap deal for flight and hotels and eventually booked our vacation for Planet Hollywood. The reviews were all so different. So many complaints and then so many happy people. So I figured I would keep an open mind and make my own review.

The flight was long and because we are from the east coast, we gained a few hours, making us a little tired. So, once we got to LV, it was 10:30am; I figured we could try and check in early. 

Before I planned the trip, I was nervous about transportation to and from the hotel. I knew we would be using the monorail to maneuver along the strip. However, I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on renting a car from Hertz when we would only really need it the first and last day. But I was afraid the taxi wouldn't be sufficient since on our last day we would need a place to put our bags while waiting for our flight for 9 hours!

When we got to the airport, there was a sign that said ""ground transportation"". My boyfriend and I hopped a taxi to PH. The ride there was only $18. I was glad we made that decision so we decided to figure out the last day transportation at a later time. 

Check in was a little annoying but I have chosen to overlook it because that was the only experience I was not satisfied with. I am in sales myself, so I understand the upsell mindset. However, this guy sounded like he was reading from a notecard. He didn't make me feel welcome and he obviously hated his job. 

We got to the room and it was super nice! The bathrooms were gorgeous! There were scratches and gouges in the wallpaper in some places. But honestly, it's Vegas!!! Most people are drunk and stupid... I didn't think it was an issue. Our room was clean. It smelled like strong cleaning stuff for a day and then diminished. 

The maid was super nice too! I left her a note with a small tip the first day asking for more toiletries and she gave me a ton! I loved the scent of the body lotion, so I was all sorts of happy. We left her a large tip at the end because she did a great job cleaning. (A previous post said that the maid didn't clean their bathtub--well, mine definitely did because my hair has been shedding and there was so signs of hair anywhere!!)

Anyway, we didn't spend lots of time in our room because we were out exploring. However, the time we did spend was awesome!

The Pleasure Pit was great but if you want better or more slot machines, definitely try other casinos. And if you make it down to Circus Circus, they have cheap roulette tables during the day. (We did well there!) 

We noticed that we were using the loyalty card at PH and then our luck started declining quite a bit. Once we ditched it, our luck turned around. Funny, right?

The last day came too fast. We were told that PH would keep our baggage while we waited for our plane. That put the icing on the cake for me. Everything was made so easy. We got to gamble another day and not have to take our bags with us. The taxi on the way back to the airport was $12!!!

I want to go back so badly! I think I'll choose PH again for location, value, and good time!",17,1,0

I'm not sure how pricing goes for this hotel since none of us paid for the room, bought food or drinks from here. We did use the hell out of valet, the bell desk and room maintenance and made sure to tip well when the service was exemplary. 

Other than the stellar decorations, the room was fairly standard with no extra frills. The bed was comfortable (when not being shared by three other people) and the linens appeared fresh out of the dryer clean. The AC was clearly in working order when we arrived back in our room at 4:30am and felt like we walked into a meat freezer.

For a reasonable price we got a room overlooking the Belagio fountains.  The room itself was cozy.  The room was tiny, but the spacious bathroom more than made up for it.  The rooms have movie props on the wall and around the room.  They aren't exactly Indiana Jones' hat, but they're fun.  Especially considering that any other hotel room would have had some bland watercolor.  The casino is tiny.  But there's also a pretty damn big mall here.  And not a high priced mall either.  We shopped at the Gap and Lucky Brand here.  

I liked this place cause it was reasonably priced, well designed,  walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go, and all in all fun.

LOCATION:
Location is excellent.  Far more superior hotels are all within walking distance on the Strip;
with Cosmo, Aria and the Bellagio all very close. You can see what you missed out on.  

HOTEL:
Check-in on a Tuesday night was smooth as there were few people waiting.  I saw long lines at all other hotels.  That said, the lines to check in or out on the weekend were HORRENDOUS.  At least 50 people deep.  After check-out we had to wait 20 minutes to place our baggage in storage (also, they don't take laptops so I was left carrying a 30 lbs backpack it).

CASINO:
Yep...hot women dancing.  If that's your biggest concern, by all means this maybe the place for you.  Though I've heard a lot of casinos (and strip clubs) boast the same thing.  I saw no free booze while gambling so I cannot comment on the frequency of the service.  Also, the casino floor seemed fairly busy most of the time.

ROOMS:
The rooms are basic.  There was a bed, some lamps, a couple of chairs.  However, the room itself was filthy.  When we arrived there was hair on the bathroom floor and a ring around the sink.  After walking on the carpet for twenty minutes the soles of our feet were covered in black...stuff.  We had to resort to wearing our socks or flip flops around the room.  Huge Jacuzzi tub, however, when I stuck my feet in to wash them (due to stepping in VOMIT on the elevator) the handle of the tub pulled off the wall.  If the cleaners had noticed the knob was loose perhaps they should have had it fixed?  And if they didn't notice, does this mean they weren't CLEANING THE TUB???  F'ing disgusting.  Yeah, it was a themed room.  Awesome.  Would have preferred they used the money to have sheets that fit the bed.  

Cleaning service was unpredictable.  One day they hadn't arrived until after 4 in the afternoon.  One morning it was at 9:30.  The next day, 2:00.  They were always different people.  I happened to be there when one guy stopped by to service the room.  This meant talking my ear off while he collected the dirty towels and wiped down the sinks.  DIDN'T even make the bed!

Also, as several other reviewers mentioned, the water took 5 or so minutes to heat.  And the walls are paper thin.

POOL:
The pools are smallish.  If you plan on camping out there at all rent a bed or cabana.  The chairs fill up quickly and because the pools are so small it's easy to be left out to sit on the ground.  If you are an avid pool goer (want to spend the day drinking beer, swimming, checking out the talent) I do NOT recommend staying at this hotel.  

EATING ESTABLISHMENTS:
This was one of the highlights of this hotel.  The food and drinks at PBR Bar (ROCK) and Cabo Wabo was delicious (and FAIRLY reasonable).  Not sure if either of these establishments are actually affiliated with the hotel though.  PBR bar has bull riding and a great patio.  CW has good patio.  And YOLOS was fine and had karaoke which was decent.  The buffet was delicious.  

Heart Bar had good service.

OVERALL:  
If you are looking for a cheapish, good location, party atmosphere with good eats this is the place for you.  If you don't care that the place is dirty (even the ELEVATORS are gross - check out the buttons!)  and you're just looking for a place to lay your head...this might be your place.  Definitely don't take people here if you are trying to impress, if they are over 30 and qualify as adults, or if it's their first Vegas experience.",1,0,0

This was my first time to Vegas so I don't really want to compare it to other Vegas rooms. The rooms are not on par with SPG. As part of my trip, we toured other hotels (Venetian, Wynn) which were much nicer (and more expensive).

There was nothing special about the room. A couple of little details really annoyed me: the batteries in the remote were dead, the tv settings were wrong and the picture was zoomed way in, unviewable, and locked ( from this, it seems like all I did was watch tv).  

The internet was out when I got there and it was a pain tracking someone down on the phone for them to tell me to try again in an hour. Tried again in the hour and it was still down. When I was there, they charged a significant amount for 24 hours and only 24 hours. My time ran out 2 hours before checkout and I had to pay the full amount for another 2 hours. I don't think this would have bothered me if I was up from the casino, but (as most people are) I was wiped out as I was leaving. 

The bathroom was huge, which was nice, but there were no floor mats and the towels were across the room (its a big room). I showered and ended up flooding the floor. Small details really but annoying. 

I gave it a non-kids friendly rating because they were promoting their show (Holly Madison's Peep Show) everywhere. A lot of lifesize pictures of the ladies doing splits on the elevator doors. They're flexible.",0,0,0

Yes, I know it is partially our fault and we can't stop beating ourselves enough up over it for being stupid and careless about such a large amount of money. We came to Vegas as a business trip for the Annual Vape Summit, and when we landed that night our safe was broken. The next morning it completely slipped our mind to call the security to fix our safe since we were in a rush out. Usually they take really long with their service to come to your room anyways. But we do know that we put out their ""DO NOT DISTURB"" sign on the door so our room doesn't get cleaned. However the room keeper came in anyways still and actually went through my boyfriends bookbag and stole his money. We called security and risk management, all they said was they'll file a report. So guess what actions they took when we followed back up? You guessed right, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

This is our second time staying at Planet Hollywood in Vegas, I use to like it but after that experience knowing they don't care enough to take real actions and they have those kind of workers, I can never bring myself here. Heres Pros & Cons about this hotel 
Pros:
-It's smacked right on the central strip
-The room rates aren't bad for the location
-It has almost every single store you need in this resort
-The vibe is pretty cool

Cons:
-The hallways and rooms are gritty, old and outdated.
-The pool is the worst out of all the hotels on the strip of Vegas
-For almost every cellular service, there is barely any reception
-The wifi sucks
-Mostly a young crowd here.

We were told that we couldn't check in yet but if we came back around noon or so we could get our room and pick up the keys later without paying early check in fees. So we left our bags with the bell desk and went to eat and gamble. I won a little on the buffalo stampede game! When we went back to check in, I told the girl at the desk that it was my first time staying at PH and asked if there were any complimentary upgrades to a fountain view. We were given a room on the 50th floor with a view from Aria all the way north to see the Trump! We had a beautiful, unobstructed view of the fountains and a huge window to watch it out of. The room was perfect. I didn't notice much signs of wear and tear. Our floor did not have an ice machine on it, which didn't matter to me but bugged my friend. The only gripe we had (aside from the ice machine) was the shower wasn't draining on our first morning. We mentioned it to an employee in the hallway as we were leaving the room and it was fixed by the time we got back later that day. We also mentioned it to the front desk at check out and the man checking us out removed one day resort fees. Top notch customer service. We ate at Burgr, which was great but overpriced, and Earl of Sandwich, which was amazing. We saw Jeff Dunham as well and it was one of the best shows I have ever seen.

You can go a thousand times and never stay in the same place twice. My boyfriend travels to Vegas at least once a month for work & I try to tag along when I can. My hands down favorite part of these trips (other than the Vegas experience itself) is picking out new hotels to stay in and try out. 
That being said, Planet Hollywood is currently my top pick. 
I love the look of the place, staff was great, check-in\/out was quick and easy, they had great food options and shopping. 
But my absolute FAVORITE part was the room! 
At check-in we were upgraded and got a massive suite with a huge 2 person tub that overlooked the strip with a massive flat screen TV. I had never been more excited to bathe in my life. We did some light gambling and had some drinks after check-in but I literally couldn't stop thinking about the bathtub. 
That night we took some beers up to the room and had a bubble-bath with just the Vegas strip for light. I will forever be thankful to that beautiful man at the front desk and that upgrade. 

There were a few things I didn't like though. 

The pool: It was really mediocre. When I'm in Vegas I like to spend the majority of my time poolside. I want some atmosphere, some music and a cute little cocktail waitress who will bring me drinks and snacks. That is not the vibe at PH, which is strange really, because you'd think it would be. 

Getting around: The place is a labyrinth. We went for self-park and entered on the complete opposite end of where the front desk was. We had to schlep our bags through the shopping mall area and all around the casino before finding check-in. 

Overall the location is great, its a visually pleasing hotel to stay in and they have video Black Jack @ the sports bar, YAY!",3,3,3

Our room was not great. Even though it's a nonsmoking room, the ventilation from the casino is probably connected to the smoking rooms because our room reeked of cigarette smoke. So gross. And it didn't have basic features that a room usually has, like a mini fridge, or a microwave, or even a coffee maker. The remote control for the TV was disgusting. And some things were falling apart like the bathroom vanities. We were not impressed at all. Probably not staying here again. I'd rather pay a bit more to stay at a better pet friendly hotel.",0,0,0

It is on the smaller size in terms of its casino floor, but the mall located within it may have something to do with it. It was nice to have such a good sized mall right below our room. If you forgot any of your necessities or need drinking water or cheap eats, then this hotel can take care of all that. The rooms were spacious and the decor was current.

Room was fine, with a great view of the Bellagio fountains, but TV needs an extension to be able to see it better from bed. Yummy food and drinks served at the pool! Carrot cake at the coffee shop was delicious and coffee was surprisingly good. Gordon Ramsey's burgers are tasty, but everything else there is average. JLO's show is wonderful ... a great production! Thinking about seeing it again. Our seats were first row behind the mixer and employees walked back and forth in front of us for the entire show.

I was really pleased with their customer service, Shawn at the front desk was really nice during my check in.

Well, the suite is very nice and as you would expect from PH - had a party theme with bumper pool table and foozball. The 1BR suite had a semi-bar. Not a full bar like other suites, but a sink to the side with a table near by and a mini-fridge. Served the purpose of storing the bottle of Goose.

The view was great. Looked directly out to the Bellagio. Saw the water show at least 5x a day. The suite had a large tv and served the purpose of hosting after hour parties.

I like PH, however, they don't really cater to the BJ players. All regular BJ tables are dealer hit soft 17. The only stay 17 are in the high pit with $100 min bets. I'm not a fan of my host as she retracted her offer during my stay b\/c of limited play. I partied more than playing b\/c of the non-friendly BJ tables.

I might go back with a new host. We'll see. But 4 stars for the suite, 2 stars for the host and 3 stars for the BJ play.

Also, they have passes to KOI every night. $20 for women, unlimited well drinks all night. I got tired of the constant harassment of passes to clubs\/bars, etc.

The room was great. It was spacious with a HUGE bathroom. It had a separate shower with a soaking tub. The toilet was in a separate alcove with a door--some have complained about no doors. While we didn't have a great view (mainly the roof), we did have a partial view of city center and down the south strip. There was a great flat screen TV, however, we weren't in the room much to use it. The bed was great with wonderful bedding.

I love hanging out in the casino. The loud 80s music sets the tone for the overall environment! While the waitress service was not the best, the bar had poker\/blackjack slots and as long as you played $1.00 a hand, you were given free drinks. The restaurants we ate at were really good and reasonable. It was nice that Miracle Mile is located there as well with great happy hour specials.

The only thing that needs attention is check in. People were not exaggerating about the long line! We arrived at 5:40p on a Monday evening. We waited in line 56 MINUTES to check in. I think this is unacceptable! Since so many people complain about this I think management needs to address it. Perhaps a simple solution would be to take the two managers they had walking around giving out free wristbands to Kio and get them behind the desk and check people in. 

Overall, it is a great place to stay! It is fun, lively and offers a great room for a reasonable price. The location is also excellent! We were able to walk everywhere or take a taxi without spending all of our hard earned winnings!!",1,1,2

Of all the casinos I went into, theirs was probably my favorite as well. It just has a fun vibe to it, nothing too pretentious or gaudy, but you can still tell you are in Vegas.

Upon my arrival to my room I immediately discover these horrible stains and chunky crud on the comforter, that was neatly placed on top of my bed that I paid 114 per night for.  I tried calling the front desk to complain and after about 2 hours of them not answering I finally just called housekeeping to give me clean linens.  When the housekeeper came in, the look on her face was priceless.  I think she was even more disgusted than I was.  She made sure to completely change everything to ensure cleanliness and said she felt embarrassed that her peers didnt catch that before. 

Anyway, I didnt have time to deal with the front desk to get upgraded to another room....one because it was a hassle sine they wouldnt answer the phone...and two I was in Vegas for a reason and had plans to attend to.  So I overlooked the burdon of the digusting bed only to discover, after a night out, that the bathroom floor had dried droplets of vomit on he bathroom floor. Need I say more? 

It wasnt just the filthy condition of the expensive room, it was also the fact that the room was severly in need of an overall renovation. The caulking around the tiles in the bathroom was dirty and disentigrating, the shower drained slowly...sure to give you toe fungus and the sink faucet had cruddy crap all around it.

I originally wanted to stay at a $35 a night hotel, but friends convinced me to ""splurge"". And this is what I get for splurging??? I would expect the actual condition of this room from a cheaper hotel.  

You may want to rethink your choice of hotel unless you want to deal with the hassle of getting upgraded to a better room. But judging by my friends who had a supposed upgraded room...it was not at all any better.",2,0,0

Rooms are clean, and there's a separate WC for the toilet, which is always a plus. I would say to the housekeeping staff to use king size sheets on the king size beds, the ones on the bed we had (a king bed) barely fit, as if they were queen sized sheets.

I used room service several times for breakfast and they were always quick and the food was decent.  

I used the gym and was quite pleased to see that is ACTUALLY a gym.  Meaning, they had at least ten treadmills, a decent amount of weight machines and lots of free weights.  The gym was never busy and the staff was friendly and helpful.  They do offer free water (you can take as much as you want) and fruit (take all you can!).  

My room was decent.  I felt like it was clean, but the view I had of the giant electrical towers was not so fab.  Looking beyond those towers, though, I was able to see the mountains and watch the sun rise and set a few times.  

This hotel has several restaurants to choose from and I ate at two of them.  Earl of Sandwich is your standard sandwich shop, but they were very accommodating to my ""picky eater"" requests.  I always appreciate that.  I also ate lunch at Planet Dailies once.  The service was fast and they even asked when I arrived if I was attending a conference and needed to be served immediately.  That was awesome.  I had a caesar salad here and it was decent.  

The shopping at Planet Hollywood is also nice.  I enjoyed wandering around the shops and people watching.

One major negative was the check-in process.  It seemed that the line never moved, that they never brought more agents in to help out and this resulted in my standing in line to check into the hotel for two hours.  Not acceptable.

The mister and I went with my sister this weekend on a Sin City excursion.  Surprisingly, I haven't been to Vegas in over 4 years.  I couldn't get over how much more stuff they packed on the strip.  Crazy!

As we went in search of hotel registration, I immediately noticed that the patrons of this hotel were on the younger side, late twenties and early thirties.  It reminded me a lot of the Hard Rock Hotel since they played a lot of cool songs overhead.  They even had a section in the casino called the Pleasure Pit that had Go-Go dancers entertaining the gamblers and young, cute female dealers in go-go looking outfits working the tables.  Only in Vegas. 

We finally found the hotel registration, it was downstairs from the casino.  It was past midnight and there were about 5 people ahead of us.  It took about 30 minutes to get to the desk...checking in shouldn't take that long.  In fact, when it was our turn, it only took about 5 minutes to register and get our keys...not sure if the other staff were slow or the people ahead of us were just clueless?  The lady at registration mentioned the free bottle of alcohol and I thought it would be one of those small ones you get on a plane...nope, it was a regular sized bottle of alcohol, my sister picked the rum. Nice!  

We get to the room and I was expecting an average room, like the ones in New York, New York, but this room was pretty big and it had two sinks on opposite sides!  For girls, that is a huge plus.  The bathroom was actually bigger than some hotel rooms in Europe!  There was a flat screen t.v. and the main sleep area was plenty spacious.  They had decor from Oscar, so there were pics of Sly Stallone. I wished we could've had a Die Hard room, I used to love Bruce Willis.  As the previous reviewer mentioned, the only downside is the lighting in the room.  At night, it is really dark even with all the lights on.  There was only a small reading lamp on the desk, 1 lamp on the side table that was in the middle of the two beds and the lamp next to the armchairs.  Even the hallway light was very, very dim.  Also, they really need to have luggage racks and they should have used frosted shower doors.  I did like they provided complimentary bottles of water. 

The location of PH is awesome, it's right in the heart of the strip, so you can walk to many of the other casinos from this location.  Although they pretty much kept the structure of the Aladdin shopping area (some parts still have an Arabian architecture), they improved the layout so you can easily get to the casino from the strip. They have cool stores, eateries, clubs, and a show (Peepshow)...What else could you ask for? Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino was better than I expected.  I would definitely be a repeat customer.",5,3,3

My friends & I usually try to get rooms at PH 'cause they're reasonably priced\/affordable. The rooms are nice as well and we love that the casino is catered toward ppl our age (20's). Each room has a different theme, I can't even keep track of the many themes we've been in. I really like the customer service at this casino as well! You don't get the shitty service at the lower casinos like Circus Circus. We've been here for celebrations such as anniversary and b-days which they've gladly upgraded our rooms for us for free which is a great plus! I remember one time we came for an anniversary and they put us in a room decorated w\/ lingerie haha it was cute.

The only bad thing about the casino is that if you park in the parking structure, you have to walk through the damn miracle mile shop all the time before you can get into the casino to get your room. I guess it's not so bad 'cause you gotta walk off all that alcohol & food you're gonna have in vegas right? 

This casino pretty much has great food. I haven't tried the spice market buffet yet, but I remember the buffet from when it was Aladdin and it was good. I have heard great stuff about the spice market buffet, but don't get me wrong it's no Wynn. There are plenty of other selections of food as well, my fav is Gordon Ramsay's Burgr and Earl of Sandwich! Lines are always packed at these restaurants, but it goes by fast.

The rooms are kept very clean, never had any issues w\/ bed bugs here. Never had any problems w\/ stains on the carpet or sheets either :) Rooms are really big for what you pay and the beds\/sheets are comfy

GUYS: you'll love this casino at night especially at the pleasure pit! Since PH caters toward the younger crowds, the gogo dancing girls and dealers are actually pretty so you get some eye candy while playing unlike other casinos w\/ old looking dealers lol.

After my first housekeeping service at PH, I discovered that a pair of my pants, hung neatly behind the bathroom door, were nowhere to be found. Clearly housekeeping thought they were towels(?!)--even though I followed the eco instructions on the card and hung all of my towels (elsewhere), because I care about the planet and didn't need them washed that night.

The hotel took no responsibility for the missing item whatsoever. They made me wait in my hotel room for over an hour so that a security guard could come up and perform an ""investigation."" All I got was a silly, nearly illegible form telling me I needed to call ""Risk Management"" within 3 to 5 days after the incident. When I told the front desk, upon my checkout, that this was unacceptable, she apologized and said she'd have Risk Management contact ME to resolve the matter: they'd be able to post a refund to my credit card in the amount of the missing item.

Weeks went by and not only did I not hear from Risk Management, but that department did not pick up the phone when I called. Ultimately, I was able to resolve the issue through my credit card company, but it should not take a third party when the issue was so clear-cut in this case.

If I hadn't had this issue with the missing pants--and if I hadn't been charged a $20 + tax ""self-check in"" fee for using the automated check-in kiosk . . . which the hotel was also unwilling to waive at check-out--I would have probably rated this facility two and a half stars. I'll say off the bat that Vegas isn't really my thing. BUT, if it's yours, the hotel is in a great location near the middle of the Strip. (It's about a 10-minute ride from the airport, an UberX ride of $12-$17 in regular traffic.)

Unfortunately, the hotel sits on top of a mangy, smoky casino, that is terribly confusing and pretty seedy. It's like a barrier to the outside. Though I was in Vegas for five days (attending a conference in the hotel), I went outdoors probably only three times. Like they say, the buildings are designed to keep you indoors, gambling. I did not gamble, however, since . . . well, it's just not my bag. But I can't imagine that Planet Hollywood would be a pleasant place to gamble, even if it were.

My hotel room was nice enough, though the bathroom persistently smelled like marijuana. Maybe the folks in the next room were smoking up habitually?

As for the conference venue and services: the food was actually pretty good--when it arrived (which might be more the conference's fault than the hotel's). There was inattentive service throughout, though, and rooms that were supposed to have chairs seemed to have no chairs, and vice versa. For a national conference, the hotel rooms were ungodly expensive. We were charged $140 daily ""special rate"" + $20 daily ""resort fee"" + tax . . . and during our stay, the hotel announced a $59\/night special ""annual sale.""

Ain't that a kick in the head?

Check in- while slow, was friendly- I wish I could remember the girl's name who checked us in, but she was really sweet; she took note of the fact that I am 6 months pregnant and made sure that we were on a high floor, facing away from the strip where she said the room would be quieter. 

Room- it's just OK. There was a broken drawer in the tv case\/vanity that was fixed about 10 minutes after we arrived by an engineer (maybe they should have these things fixed before they check people into the rooms? I know hotels, having worked in them for years- you can put a room ""out of order"" if something needs to be fixed). He was pleasant, and it was fixed quickly, but it was a bit awkward. The bed was comfy, we had enough space for the two of us. The bathroom was ehhh... minimal water pressure in the shower coming out of a shower head that has to have been there since the Aladdin days. 

WiFi- the note that is given on check in informs you of what you get by paying the ""resort fee"". Yet, when you go to sign on to the WiFi, it tells you that you will be charged (there is no note that one device is complimentary). Trying to get ahold of someone in this hotel to ask whether it will truly be complimentary is like trying to get ahold of God. Impossible. We tried for two days to call the Front Desk at all different times of the day, and finally reached someone who confirmed that yes, one device was complimentary. Once we got it, it was slower than molasses in January. Time to update!

Housekeeping- nice, prompt, friendly when we passed them in the hall on our way out for breakfast. She asked what room we were in, and said she would clean our room next, so that it was done by the time we got back. I appreciated that! It would have been nice if they had emptied the water out of the ice bucket and replaced the bag though.

Casino- UGH. SO UNIMPRESSIVE. 

Restaurants- We ate at Burgr, the food was pretty mediocre. 

Pool- Where do I begin? Band aids on the ground, outdated lounge chairs (what is up with the ""No Man's Land"" in between the two pools?) and NO COCKTAIL SERVICE unless you happen to get lucky and get a place by the pool. Come on, PH- it's Memorial Day Weekend. Every single cab driver and person we talked to said that it's one of your busiest weekends of the year. I might not be drinking alcohol, but I would have ordered at least one or two of your $12 bottles of water and probably some food had someone come by. The entire 2-3 hours that I sat there, not one single cocktail waitress even came close to me, and the chairs where I was sitting (in No Man's Land) were PACKED. It's hotter than Hades in that area, and no umbrellas, so you should be able to deduce that that will make people THIRSTY. This means $$ for you. It's not hard to figure out.

It's a great location, nice and centrally located, but I wish we had shelled out a little bit more money and stayed some place a little nicer. I'll never stay here again.",1,0,0

Room was clean and nice, but small.

Location is not bad and prices are just OK - could be better though. Wifi is not complimentary what a shame! We stayed there many nights, I thought they would be nice and offer us Wifi, but no...

I will not return there because I found their service unfriendly in general.
Other hotels we stayed at were much nicer. It's not like you have a limited choice of hotels on the strip :-)

I did not like their casino's atmosphere. I was freezing there. And too overwhelming in my taste. Girls dancing on pole bars a bit everywhere. Nice if you like it but it was ""too much"" in my opinion. They could remain a little more classy. 

Anyways... Nice place to stay but definitely not my fav.",0,0,0

I cannot believe that I am trying to sleep in an uncomfortable chair in my room because they are incapable of cleaning it... particularly the blood stained sheets and towels we were given the day before. I wish I could say I didn't sleep in these disgusting sheets but we only noticed the next morning. I have the flu and called the first time at 2:30 pm to let them know we were finally leaving the room and we needed it to be cleaned (ie blood stained sheets and towels). When we came back at 10:30 pm it had not been cleaned. My husband and I called at the beginning of each hour after that until 1:00 am. The manager at the front desk gave us several excuses for the failure to clean (""do not disturb sign left out?"" No!, ""maids changing shifts?"" In 12 hours and at least 5 calls? No!) There is no excuse! 

You know... I was going to ignore the annoying lamps in the room that turn on only 1 out of 20 times, the tv remote that also hardly works, the broken bath faucet, and no mini fridge or microwave, but seeing as how they totally fail in the hospitality department and cleanliness department I will NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone.

I lugged all my stuff back to the front desk, had to profusely apologize as I cut all the other people waiting in line, and explained the situation. Mistakes happen, but it's how customer service responds when those mistakes occur that makes or breaks a business.

So we got there kind of late (around 5pm) and half our group was staying at the Aria across the street. I told the check-in guys that we didn't want to spend $300 a night which is why we are staying there. He told me not to worry - AND we got upgraded!! All 3 rooms got upgraded to Full 180 degrees Panoramic view suite!! It was amazing!! Our rooms were at least 4x the size of our friends rooms at Aria. And we paid less than 1\/3 of the price. And we didn't have to pay a $20 a night resort fee. I'm officially a huge fan of Planet Hollywood. 

The Full Panoramic view suite was amazing!! The living room was huge.... it literary was a half circle wrapping around the building. The view was amazing too, check out my photos. 

TIP for Room Upgrade - Either go early, like right at 12:00 or late like 5 - 6 pm. If they are full (or beyond 98% full) they know they will have to upgrade a portion of the rooms anyways, so if you go early they might give you the upgrade. But if they are really not full, go at 6 pm when they think no one else is going to check in so they give you the suites. Out of all the times I gone to Vegas (well over 15 times), I think I only NOT gotten upgrade once. Good luck",5,2,2

About 2 nights into our stay, my husband coughed up in bed and I called housekeeping to come and dispose of our bedding and replace it with new sheets. When they came to the room, about 4 housekeepers came in and made me feel very uncomfortable. One of the ""so sweet"" ladies told me we would have to replace the mattress. They left after leaving us with a plastic liner on the bed (perfectly comfy for a hotel...). About 15 minutes passed and a loud knock was at the door. I opened it and 3 security guards were at the door and telling me I had to immediately come downstairs. I hesitantly agreed and followed them. They treated me like a prisoner. Not the best way to treat your guests. I was greeted in the lobby by the manager were he told us he was charging us for the $900 mattress. I am furious. I would never intentionally stay here again.

I hope this review will help, I will do a break down, I apologize for the lengthy review. 

We were there in May 2016 for our photo engagement shoot, wedding is this fall, ceremony and reception will be held at the Planet Hollywood.

This hotel is pretty basic, nothing special about this hotel, no sceneries to make a nice souvenir photo. This hotel is family friendly, ton of food and shopping and it's cheap. Attracts a lot of younger crowds. That's why I gave it 4 stars.

1. Reservation: It was quick and easy reservation

2. Check in: Planet Hollywood has a small check in reception area, line was long took about 15 mins standing in line to check in. They could make their check in counter bigger and more customer service reps during the peak check in.

3. Rooms: We stayed on the 52nd floor it was a resort room with strip\/fountain view. We were lucky the room we stayed in had been recently renovated. No complained on the room everything was nice. 

4. Pool: While we were walking through the hall to get to the pool, the hall was dark and dingy, glad they're going through renovations. The pool and the pool area is just a pool pretty basic, nothing special.

5. Food at the Spice Market was basic, but hearty, I did finding myself hitting the ribs a few time and the warmed crab legs, yes, I had 3 plate full of crab legs. Overall, it was good, I hate to say this, I even went to the Bellagio for the buffet surprisingly, the food was ok, the presentation was great, my apologies if I offend other Bellagio buffet fan. Sorry. I did not find myself going back for seconds at the Bellagio, but the presentation of the food was AMAXING! It was really pretty. Anyways, getting back to Spice Market Buffet....the service was excellent, didn't have any problem there.

6. Food at Koi Restaurant and Lounge, we were there with 7 people, it's Japanese California fusion, the food was great! No complain, service was great.

7. Room service: We also had room service also and the food is great no complain there either, we had omelets, burgers, BLT sandwiches, pancakes, waffles, and they all were great, food was still hot when it was delivered to our room.

8. Shopping: Walked around the Miracle Mile it was a lot of shops, but I didn't purchase anything there, I went shopping at Chanel and Louis Vuitton.

9. The casino area, we walked through, we're not gamblers so I assume it's just like any gambling casino on the strip.

10. Check out: It was easy and quick. No hassles there.

And that it is for my May trip, overall this is a great hotel if you have business to attend to nice and relaxed atmosphere.",4,0,0

And before that, they had us in the Sylvester Stallone room but it turns out it was a handicap suite. No wonder the bathroom had no tub, just a big shower with bars and a wooden seat in it. After being moved, we had an okay stay. 

Like I said, it's a hotel that's geared for the young, trendy traveler and you can see that all around the casino. Douchebags with cigars, idiot girls with dresses that had their coochies on display and more. 

The pool was a nightmare on it's own. If you are not there at the crack of dawn to grab a seat, you're screwed. Oh, and the best part? It's hot as all hell outside but when you dip your toes in the pool, it's like you are about to jump into the arctic sea. The water in the pool is just BEYOND freezing, even on a hot summer day, it was just painful to sit in the pool.

When we checked in with a reservation (my boyfriend even called the night before to confirm our reservation, room rates etc.), we were told that the hotel was sold out and that they were going to try and accommodate us by giving us a special two room suite. Traveling with an 11 month child in our group, we found it extremely frustrating that it took them an hour to get their act together and find us a room. Once we were in our room, we noticed that we had an ironing board, but no iron so we called the front desk to have an iron delivered to our room. After 4 phone calls and 6 hours had elapsed, we finally got the iron. The room smelled like mold and mildew and the smell penetrated from the bathroom into the living room. We were later told that the hotel rushed to open 300 rooms in time for the New Year travelers and probably gave us a room that was not ready for guests. 

The next morning, we saw housekeeping outside of our room so we assumed our room was going to be cleaned. We got back to the room at 3:00 in the afternoon and our suite had not been cleaned, so we pressed the service button on our door. Shortly thereafter, someone called and asked us what we needed. I informed them that we needed our room cleaned and the woman on the phone said, ""we can accommodate that special request for you"". Last I remembered, fresh sheets and clean towels were standard and not a special accommodation. We returned to our room at 10:30 that evening and not to our surprise, our room had not been cleaned. There were hundreds of people in the lobby with complaints (people trying to check-in but their rooms weren't ready) and we could hear our neighbors yelling next door about how horrible the hotel was. My boyfriend attempted to go downstairs to speak to someone at the front desk - after waiting for 20 minutes, one of the lobby staff lost it and walked off the job, leaving many people waiting for service. 

It doesn't end there. The next day, we saw housekeeping outside and specifically asked them to make sure to clean our room (given that it was not cleaned the night before). We came back to our room at 6:00 in the evening and some of the rooms were cleaned, but our bedroom was not. Apparently, housekeeping did not know that it was a TWO room suite - so they cleaned one bedroom, but not the other. I was on hold for 15 minutes before the PH lobby desk picked up the phone and proceeded to tell us that the hotel should not have opened when it did. To accommodate our frustration, he promised us fresh sheet and towels - 20 minutes later, we were given 2 towels. Umm....2 towels? We again had to go to the front desk and spoke to someone (the same woman who walked off the job the night before) and all she could say is ""understood"" and ""we are sorry"". She also admitted that, ""to be realistic with you, it was a nightmare last night. Your room would not have been cleaned last night anyways"". This hotel doesn't even deserve one star. This hotel may be central to the strip, but NEVER again will I stay in a hotel like this.",2,0,0

You have to walk through the Miracle Miles shops to get to the hotel\/casino which I thought was a pain because I didn't want to walk through it every time we had to go to our car.  

The layout is really weird and the signs don't really help.  I circled the casino looking for the lobby and eventually realized it is downstairs.  Check in took what seemed like a lifetime.  The line literally stopped moving for a few minutes and  as the line grew longer fewer people were helping with check in.  Shouldn't management provide more staff members to accommodate the line instead of having them leave?  I already had a bad first impression.

The room itself was alright with nothing really special unless you consider the movie theme special.  Depending on your theme it can be hit or miss.  We got Air Bud 2.  Really Air Bud 2?  The layout of the room is just weird...I think they were trying to change the layout so people would not be reminded of the Aladdin.  Plain and simple they did not utilize the space well.  The bed was comfy and the linens were crisp and clean.  Bathroom was nice though I would prefer double sinks, but that's just my preference.  There was no floor mat for the shower so the floor gets all wet when you're done unless you put a regular towel down as your floor mat.

I probably would not stay at PH again unless I got a killer deal.  If it weren't for the location I would probably give it 2 stars based on customer service.

As for food, we ordered PF Chang's room service one night and of course it was delicious, but we went to the Spice Market Buffet the next day and it really is no good. I'd give it a C-. But I'll admit I'm a bit of a food snob (what yelper isn't?).

Now, here's a tip... Remember your walk from the check-in to the elevators. Because, that will be the last time you don't get lost in this hotel. More about that later.
I had requested a mini fridge for my beer, oops, medication. It was promptly brought up 5 minutes after we got into the room.
The hallway smelled overwhelmingly like smoke. I mean, I'm a smoker, and it bothered me. But, being in Vegas, you get used to it. ( The room smelled fine btw)
Had a good view of the strip.
It wasn't noisy like some other reviewers have said ( but then again I was 27 floors up. The only noise I heard was, well.... never you mind what that noise was)
Room was plenty big, and a cool bathroom with a big tub, which I would have like to have some extra carricular activities in, until I saw the poster of Morgan Freeman right above it. I swear he was staring at me. So much for sex in the bath tub.
Casino was like any other casino, except at night, they had gorgeous women wearing next to nothing dealing, and dancing around the tables.
Nother tip... Eyes forward unless you want to walk in face first into slot machines all night. The sexy girls will be dealing and dancing all week, no need to stare.
Now, lemme say this. I hate puzzles. I hate mazes, and I hate Sudoku. 
This hotel is combines all 3, in that it's impossible to find anything you're looking for, unless it's by accident. I think it's round, which doesn't help getting around.
I wanted to try earl of sandwich my first night, and I'll be dammed if I could find the joint. Finally, after asking every 10 feet, we bumped into it ( but it was worth it. Those sandwiches are awesome).
The location of the hotel is perfect. It's right in the middle of all the hub bub.
Never had a problem with anyone who worked in, or for the casino or hotel. Everyone holds doors, smiles, and nods.
The only 2 problems I had was the fact the my sink didn't drain properly, and the hot water wasn't so hot. I know some clowns on Yelp would take off 4 stars for that, but Christ, it's vegas. Get over yourself.",0,1,0

The only quirky thing about it was the movie memorabilia from the film 'Made in America' starring Whoopi Goldberg.

The restaurants in the hotel were convenient and very good.  We had a late dinner one night at Planet Dailies (the Tex-Mex Egg Rolls were excellent.)  We also ate at the Spice Market Buffet twice, once for breakfast and lunch.  The wait staff were friendly and the food was great.

Out of all the years I've been coming to Vegas, I've never stayed in the same hotel twice.  I've made it a bit of a mission to try as many hotels on the strip as possible.  I'm currently up to 13, and so far Planet Hollywood has been one of the most disappointing. 

We picked PH because of the great price, the convenient location and the fact that it's still clinging to some sort of coolness factor, given that it has a rotation of cool concerts at the Axis Theater, connection to the Miracle Mile shops and it's fairly newer\/not as outdated as some of the other hotel choices on the strip (i.e. Bally's).

Unfortunately, with all the seeming ""convenience"" as mentioned, you'll pay the price with waits and lines for nearly everything ... valet, check-in, elevators, taxi stands, even the little Starbucks across from check-in. It took 30+ minutes to check-in.  I thought we had it bad, but when I turned around the line was longer and the people behind us were literally sitting on the floor using their bags as a pillow.  

The pool area consisted of two pools - one sad excuse for a family pool and a 21+ pool.  The family pool had too many cabana and chairs ""for rent"" and not enough for regular patrons that just want to enjoy the pool area.   The 21+ pool was much better, but again, not very large compared to other hotels on the strip - this pool also opens a bit later than the family pool. There is also a giant tanning deck filled with beach chairs ... you know what would have been a better use of that area? A pool! Imagine that.

Pros: Bathroom was huge with double sinks and a separate toilet, which was nice.  Bed was comfy.  Location is great. Casino is nice. Cheap stay.

A couple more disappointing factors:
-Walls were thin ... you can hear other rooms, when they were going to the bathroom, taking a shower, talking, babies crying, TVs ... 
-No fridge in the room, making it tough to bring leftovers back of or to chill water\/drinks.
-We were on a non smoking floor but there was a steady and consistent smell of smoke and sometimes even weed.  I woke up in the middle of the night coughing. I had to call the front desk to confirm that I was in a non-smoking room, and according to them, I wasn't.  I promise, I'm not a grandma, I just didn't want to be charged for making the room smell bad.  I guess the ventilation system was just that bad.  I spent half my time nauseous from the smell of the smoke.  
-Lots and lots of families ... babies crying and screaming.  A lot more babies than I've seen at other hotels.

I doubt I would ever stay here again, no matter how inexpensive the price.",8,1,0

I was confident that it was going to be a wonderful hotel because I spoke to a lot of people and everyone had nothing but good things to say about it.

When we got there, I found it interesting how the loading and unloading zones were underground. It seemed every other hotel had theirs right in front of the hotel. Anyway, I was amazed with the simple but beautiful lobby. Well, the massive chandeliers that were by the escalators were beautiful. The lobby was pretty dark but that was not really a concern. Preston, the guy who checked us in, was very courteous and very helpful. I think he set my first impression of the hotel, which was a positive one. He also said somewhere along the lines of us being upgraded. Liked that too.

When we got to our room, I was very excited. It did seem like we were upgraded, with the huge room, bathroom and the amazing view. There were a few things that annoyed us, such as the TV and the phone not working. That was quickly fixed though so it wasn't too much of a big deal. It's just annoying having to go downstairs to the front desk and ask them to fix things because we can't call to have the said things to be fixed. 

The pool area is nice and huge, but we didn't end up actually partying there. We just checked it out. I also like the fact that this hotel is attached to the Miracle Mile Mall, which was a huge convenience for us as we got our snacks, meals and booze from the mall. 

What I liked about the casino were the places to eat. Earl of Sandwich, in particular was my fave. There was a 24h Starbucks, a P.F. Changs (ew), Planet Dailies (too $$$$ imo) and some other fancy restaurant we didn't bother checking out. Oh and Gallery nightclub is there too. Not a very good club. Well, not my scene\/crowd.

What I didn't like about this casino was the lay out. Oh hot damn, I HATE the bloody lay out of the casino. Every single time, and I mean EVERY single time we tried to get out of there or tried to go upstairs, we would be lost! It was literally like a maze. I was confused every single time. And it didn't help for those times when I was drunk (which was about 90% of the time). Imagine my pain. No, don't actually. You'll cringe.

Other than that, it's a great place. Love love LOVE the fact that it's right in the middle of the strip. Wherever we went, cab rides were about $10 a pop so it wasn't too bad. It was also very close to our favorite clubs. I also love that Holly Madison's Striptease was showing here. I didn't see it because I didn't have enough time, but I will next time!

Would I stay here again? Probably not. it's Vegas - I want to stay and experience the other hotels. Would I recommend this to people who plan on staying there? Absolutely. Just bring a compass or GPS or something for that wretched casino. I'd give this place a 3.5\/5 but since Yelp doesn't do half stars, I'm bumping it up to 4\/5.",1,0,0

I don't want to repeat what has already been written about PH, so instead I'll write about the NCAA tournament ""MAN CAVES"" my buddies and I reserved the first weekend of games (also St. Patty's Day weekend). Our reservation was for Sunday, 3rd round of games. The man cave area was fairly empty as we figured most popular days were Thursday and Friday (more games being played).

Man caves were in it's own secluded area upstairs. The area was sectioned off into 6-7 different man caves which had their own beer pong table, pool table, 4 tv's, and multiple couches. The decor was similar to the rest of Planet Hollywood, very sleek and modern. The entire area was dim. We had our own personal bar and access to our own betting counter which wasonly 6 steps away. It's all you can eat and drink for the entire day. The food was average. They had what you would expect: veggie platter, chicken wings, quesadillas, pulled pork, sandwiches, pizza and fries.

Service was great. They generally walked around once and awhile to check up on us, but they were around so we found them and ask them if we needed anything. So my friend found a mid-sized basketball hoop next door (those game machines you would find in an arcade). We started playing on it and ended up spending a good portion of the day going back and forth. The employees noticed and turned on the tv's in that room. After talking with them, we found out that it was one of the ""championship rooms"" which basically mean a bigger man cave. It's about 4 times as big, with more couches and one additional tv screen projector. They said since no one was using it anyway, we could use both. Employees were very chill and accommodating. I would do it again, but probably catch the 2nd round Thursday and Friday games instead. More games, better value.

Maid service sucked... since I was working a trade show, my schedule fluctuated and there were days when I didn't leave until the afternoon.

I used to prefer Planet Hollywood Westgate to the regular Planet Hollywood Hotel because the rooms were newer, nicer, and cleaner.  Also, the Westgate pool is a lot nicer than the regular PH pool.  However, Westgate is now owned by Hilton, meaning you [technically] aren't allowed in the old Westgate pool if you are just staying at PH (unless you have Hilton Player's Club Card).  And the Planet Hollywood regular pool is pretty awful.

The pool is on a different level than the majority of the lawn chairs.  When you first step out onto the pool deck, you are basically standing on a cement roof with lawn chairs.  Laying out on this floor is unbearably hot and uncomfortable in the summertime.  If you go upstairs to the pool level, there is a dinky pool with a very limited number of lawn chairs (which were all taken up by the time we got there, just around 11, noon).  Any other seating on the pool level requires you to pay for a cabana... um, heck no.  Not paying to lay out by the pool in my own hotel!  It's definitely not a pool party, fun atmosphere, so why would I pay for a cabana as if I'm at a legit Vegas pool party... Dumb.

Anyway, the pool issues aside, the rest of the hotel is pretty convenient and fun.  Tons of casual food options (not so much fine dining), shopping on Miracle Mile, ABC Store for picking up toiletries & alcohol, Fat Tuesdayyyyy (!!), and of course, 24-hour Earl's Sandwiches - aka the perfect drunchies.  The location of the hotel is pretty central on the Strip and especially convenient if you are planning on going to Marquee at the Cosmopolitan.  The convenience of the surrounding Miracle Mile shops are probably what I like most about Planet Hollywood.  Also, the free self-parking.

Accommodations are not particularly new or updated, but they are at least clean and the beds are comfortable enough.  My group of friends occupied pretty much an entire hallway.  We got a few regular double rooms and a two-bedroom suite.  The double rooms were pretty standard for this price point.  The suite was nice and spacious, although the second bathroom was a bit small.  The couches and furniture also feel & look a bit...used up, so I suggest not lifting the couch cushions... Service is OK - no major problems or complaints.

Overall, I think PH is a great option if you are cheap, in your 20s, and visiting Vegas to party with friends.  It's less appropriate for families and couples looking for a romantic getaway.",0,1,1

I'm guessing every room has a movie theme to them. Ours was Bill and Ted themed.  All it had was a t-shirt prop framed on the wall and screen shots from the movie on the walls and in the bathroom.  It was just weirdly tacky. 

The shower was cramped and the water pressure was painful.  The shower head wasn't adjustable so it shot water at your face or your chest (if you're taller).  There was also a leak from unde the shower so water would pool out onto the bathroom floor.  

The purple chair in our room had white stains all over it, the tv made loud static noises, and one of the lights didn't turn on.  

The pools sucked.  It was two regular sized pools and two tiny jacuzzis. Most of the ""pool area"" was just sunbathing chairs everywhere.  

The photo table after the Britney concert also sucked.  No organization whatsoever so people were just crowding around a table.  There was no way to look at a digital copy at ones own convenience either.  

Valet took 30 minutes to retrieve the car and they parked it in the middle of incoming traffic very far from the curb.  

Anyway, this hotel isn't really a ""destination"" hotel like Mandalay Bay or Ceasar's Palace so like I said, if you're just looking for a low-cost place to sleep that's walking distance from everything else, this is it.",4,1,1

I had such a negative experience and it never got better things continue to get worse. On June 3, 2016 I went to see the Jennifer Lopez concert. First of all we paid for a Bellagio view of the water and got sky view on the 50th floor. They put us on the floor where the butlers live. It was hot in our room but i thought it was me being excited not until we walked out of the room and got in the hallway did i realize my air conditioner in our room was not working. I asked to change rooms immeditalty being that we were in a rush of changing rooms i left my Diamond necklace in our room safe and when i called the front desk they were not concern they took a report and pacified me and said i would be getting a call. Meanwhile time was of the essence. . Left message with maid service multifple times along with supervisors and with maintenance staff since they were the ones that repaired the air conditioner. Within 2 hours later the room was already occupied. They would not check the room and no one ever helped me. They kept on giving me the run around. I was never able to retrieve my necklace and they made me go to Security to check lost and found. It was not lost I just never grabbed it from the safe and they would not go up to retirvie it. I had to do a report when we checked out and when i followed up with the report i was told it was handle by a 3rd party Insurance company. Since a report was taken the 3rd party vendor that handles thier insurance claims they would not discuss the matter. No ONE discussed the matter with me. I felt like they just didn't CARE all they had to do was go and retrieve it. Diamond was never recovered nor did I get a call back. 

Also after checking out of the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino I went to Starbucks down stairs in the Casino area (still in the resort ) and left my new Iphone at the counter there. I realized a hour later I didn't have my phone and decide to track my phone. My phone showed up at the same place where I left it.  I then called starbucks at Planet Hollywood and they said there was no phone left behind. No sooner than i hung up the phone with them my Cell phone was on the move and five minutes later my phone was shut off I was no longer able to trace it. I went back to the hotel within 10 minutes of the phone call and asked the Starbucks counter who had my phone they said they didn't know. No phone was left behind. I made a scene at this point they were liars and thieves. I went back to security to make another report or to retrieve footage and my cell phone was calling my husbands phone it was a staff member that had my phone and called my husband to tell them they had found it. Believe what you may but the people I came in contact with were incompetent staff, liars and thieves. i would never recommend this Resort based on my personal experiences to anyone. In addition, Planet Hollywood Las Vegas resort and Casino did nothing to help the situation or put my mind to ease. The insurance company denied the claim and said they were not at fault. I could not even discuss the matter as to how they came up to their findings. They said it was ""works of the Hotel"" and could not be discussed. Horrible Horrible experience. The only positive thing was the friends I was with that weekend.

We drove from Houston and I knew we'd have a ton of stuff to haul with us. We were there to get married. Loaded up our truck and on are way we went.

I was peeved that there early check in policy had changed. When we came back in 2010 we could check in early with  no penalty. This time, we had to pay $15 to check in between 12-4. We had checked out of our previous hotel and decided to make our way to PH.

Not much had changed since my last visit. Our room was AMAZING. No strip view, but I wasn't there for the view from my room. It had plenty of room and the bathroom was out of this world. The double sinks and bigger separate shower were divine. This space came in handy for the day I had to get ready for my wedding. I highly recommend this type of room for people, like me, that need the space.

As you know, this hotel use to be the Aladdin so walking around the hotel and the Miracle Mile Mall have some parts of that middle eastern theme in tact.

Check in is right below the casino, so you'd have to take an escalator going back up to the casino vice versa to take a cab or pick up your car.  Our room was not too shabby and no Bellagio, the room was painted dark brown with one small window the size of a port hole and very dirty indeed. Not a lot of outlets to charge your cell and laptop. The flat screen was nice but the room could use some more lighting as it was pretty dim. The bathroom still has some of that Aladdin style and the tub and shower was a nice touch and clean.

Casino vibe here was pretty calm during the day but at night they pump the music way too loud and I could hardly hear my friend talking right next to me. Clientele was mostly young college kids getting their drink on and som e shady looking characters. The 3 best restaurants in my opinion at the PH are the Spice Market Buffet, Earl and PF Chang's and the rest are all mediocre. 

The pool is nothing to write about and one thing I like about Planet Hollywood the most is Miracle Mile because it's just walking distance to your room and the ABC sStore was a joy to have. This hotel doesn't live to the hype and theme and I think the Aladdin Hotel still lives inside Planet Hollywood . I wouldn't stay here again annd reading about hotel guest's rooms being broken into is just sad.

The best aspect of this casino is that the interior is well laid out. In fact one could take the escalator to the top and view the entire layout ! It's that simple. Most of everything you need is already in the casino. So you never feel lost. A good idea is to take a look at the map. Its pretty symmetrical. The heart bar is quite literally at the heart of it. Try finding your way inside umm say Bellagio\/Caeser's and u'll understand why this is so important. 
There are poker tourney's at convenient times. For a non-serious gambler like me that is all I needed. Food is in abundance. The spice market buffet is one of the best. I was shocked(pleasantly) to see tandoori and butter chicken with Nan bread !

Throughout my stay I never wasted time walking about since I always knew where what was. The food choices were many...mexican, chinese, continental, mix(buffet)...several more choices in the mall. Speaking of which the mall has things which you might have forgotton to bring along. For my needs I never had to loop around the mile mall. Only went as far as a block on each side.

As for the room(Hollywood hip) it was huge ! I politely asked for a view room but was politely refused(not a biggie since I was already comping for free !!). I asked for a high floor room so I could at least enjoy some natural view and I was more than happy since it was a full moon night ! I walk in my room and see the full moon through the window ! Thats like 50% of a honeymoon feeling right there ;) So i just sat and soaked in the beauty of the solo moon over the nevada desert in the clear night...so pristine...soothing. The window nook was is a nice touch and inviting. I just lay their and rejuvenated for the promising night....tiredness of the travel melting away. And then I noticed the theme of the room...it was Seven(Mr. Brad pitt mocking me throughout my stay...seemed to ask me why i hate him so).
Bathroom was huge with a big tub. TV was ok. Clock radio could've been better.

The Coffee doolimajigar in the room was good and easy to make and use. never seen a nice handy clean free machine like that before.

Another good part is that there is free wi-fi at the Earl of Sandwich inside the casino ! Harrah's entertainment(now renamed as Caeser's entertainment) charges high for the wi-fi. So if you need a quick whiff of the internet then grab a sandwich at this place and enjoy free wi-fi. You don't have to buy anything to use it even. Too bad I found out about the wi-fi on my last day :( Until then I'd been using the coffee shop inside the mall and the sporting house at NYNY.

The outside facade of this hotel is awesome at night. I don't think any other casino has so many large neat video displays outside. I always like good lighting....attracts me like a bug...

Things I did not like:
A big club\/lounge is sourly missing. KOI is a pathetic attempt at a nightclub. It is too small and on both occassions I was at KOI the patrons did not seem too excited. The environment felt inhibiting. I won't be surprised if this was converted into a nightclub as an after thought to fill the void left by closure of Prive.  So...on most nights I had to get my fun elsewhere...XS, PURE.
For my 4 night stay there were only 2 regular coffees. 2 were decaf. Who drinks decaf ????????? When I need coffee it means I need caffeine ! Extra coffee had to be ordered and paid for ! So I just grabbed some from the housecleaner lady(shhhh...) who always seem to be lurking about...

Bed had a big sag in the middle....so I just dreamed on the edges.

Another pet peeve of mine is when there are no regular BJ tables. BJ is supposed to pay 3 to 2 people !! I flatly refuse to play on any 6 to 5 tables.

I did not use housecleaning since I did not have a need for it. So I cannot comment upon it. I am a pretty well managed clean guy and there were 4 sets of towels...all i needed.

These points are for the management : The heart bar could be used more effectively during off-peak times. I always found it almost empty (Sun-Thu). Only on Wed night I saw a band playing which was a nice touch. However If you noticed there was hardly anyone sitting there. More brainstorming needs to be done here...
The top floor seems to have abundant unused place....wtf is this for ? use it...use it welll...this is vegas...not a warehouse.",1,1,1

Cons: service is really slow.  We had to call a couple times to get extra water glasses. It finally showed up two hours later after 3 calls. The rooms aren't great and the view was of an alley. But, the bathrooms are really nice with a giant tub.  

Also, the rooms are movie themed which is kind of cool.  There are props and posters all over the place. For the casino part, it is small and not much to do.  But the heart bar is a good time. It's more chill than other places on the strip.

We couldn't even sleep. 
When we checked out we mentioned how terrible the room was and asked what was on the 39th floor. The check-out person told us ""Well if you're a light sleeper you should have told us.""

Also, the glasses in the room had lip marks on them, so we had to hand wash them with a rag and soap in order to drink from them.

It all began on a Friday afternoon when we arrived to Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino.  First thing that bothered me was that there was only 3 or 4 guys working the hotel's valet.  Hmm... isn't Friday the busiest arrival day in Vegas?   The Valet was full and since there's a mall next to the hotel, the self-parking lot was packed! I forgot to mention, it was also Black Friday.  When you drive to Las Vegas from LA you know your ass is tired. I just wanted to get off the car and check in.  Do you know how anxious a person gets when they get to Las Vegas?  All that road trip through the desert to see that beam of light from Luxor can get a person pretty excited.  On top of that, you will most likely find traffic on the strip when getting to this hotel so the last thing I wanted was to self-park or find a full valet.  Finally we managed to convince the valet guys to let us squeeze one more car so they got their tip for that.

The Room:  Pretty decent beds and furniture, nothing special.  Wait a minute!  No mini fridge?  In a double Queen Suite???  Why do I see Rambo's grenades or Terminator's sunglasses displayed on the coffee table like a museum but I don't get a mini fridge?  Dear Planet Hollywood: Did you know your hotel is in Las Vegas and people need to store alcohol in a cold place?  Geez, what am I going to do with Rambo's grenades when I need a cold beer?  Also,  I hate how there's no locks on bathroom doors.  I understand this is Planet Hollywood and retards probably come here to pretend they are movie stars and party like them which may result in over doses that could result in hospitals which could lead to deaths and therefore no locks are safe and all that safety babble... But I'm not a retard and I definitely don't want to act like a Hollywood star!  I want to take my shower privately so that house keeping can't surprise me in the shower!  There should be an option for people that want locks on bathroom doors that wont act like retards.

They also charge a fee if you call for towels or even cups.  Ridiculous.  People tip the employees that bring stuff to the room so why take away their money with your fees Planet Hollywood?  Bad business etiquette.

The Casino:  It's a Las Vegas Casino, nothing special.  Prices average just like anywhere on the strip but I did like $15 minimum bets on Saturday nights compared to $20 in other casinos on the strip.  The free beveragesskimped out on alcohol though.  I'm spending money here so please give me a real drink!  My gin and tonic tasted like 7up and Zima... I'm ordering beer bottles next time.  There was this one dealer at the roulette table that ignored us for a long time.  We dropped the money on the table like we're supposed to waiting for chips and since he gave us no attention we had to speak up and shake the bills in the air ""hey! I need chips!"" .  The guy got mad saying we need to leave the money on the table.  No shiz, dickhead!  It was there for almost 5 minutes and your lazy ass never noticed.  First roll came through and a zero hits the roulette when we were playing numbered rows only.... This guy was just bad luck.   We moved to another table where Koko, the Korean dealer, took care of us.  We had some luck up in that table!  Up $570 thanks to Koko.  I'll gamble with her for sure next time.  We found this table with only one person and turned it into 8 - 10 people throwing their money there.

To conclude my stay, I liked the proximity to the mall, the strip and specially to Earl of Sandwich (must have, read my review) but the hotel and the casino was pretty Meh...  I don't think I'll be booking my stay in this place again but I'll definitely come play roulette with Koko.",1,0,0

Everything you need is here, from gambling to shopping.

My favorite is the ABC Store. Reasonable prices and sell bottles of booze. Do what I did, buy a bottle and chug it on the strip. I'm a cheap date.

Rooms were great, stayed at the resort room with HD flat screen TV. Beds were comfy and the front desk are nice. I will stay here without a doubt again.

No problems with staff, although we didn't need much so it was very minimal communication. We needed a connecting room and the front desk was able to accommodate us. 

Great location on the strip with many shopping and food options within the hotel, as well as easy access to other hotels near by.

Now for the rooms...we stayed on the 24th floor. Off hand the rooms look okay. Truly nothing fancy or special. Beds are fitted with plain white comforters and pillows, and room is decorated with with movie themed items. Ours was Jurassic Park. The furniture was very outdated. A lot of scratches and dings that were pretty obvious. The display for the movie poster seemed pointless. It took up a lot of unnecessary space and held no closet room. 

Beds...horrible. They sink in and squeak! I've never stayed in a hotel with beds this bad!! The bathroom was...okay. But the shower...gross. The floor of the shower had mildew stains as the drain was rusted. The shower itself is really small and our door happened to be coming off the rubber that secured it to the wall. And the towels had a weird smell on one of the days of ur stay :( 

Overall the room just seems old and dirty. Dust in places and cleanliness was disappointing. If you're looking for a decently priced hotel, and nothing too fancy, this might be of interest to you. BUT I have stayed at another hotel, even cheaper, located in a very good place on the strip...that was definitely much cleaner and well kept. 

So no, I probably would not stay here again.",2,1,1

The location of the hotel is very central, smack dab in the middle of the strip! The buffet here is also really good and with the buffets of buffets, it's a pretty unbeatable deal! The biggest complaint, the walk from self parking to the lobby is a pretty far walk!

A BIG positive:
I would like to say Thank you so much to the security guy that was working Wed night August 29 or more correctly Thurs morning August 30 around 4 or 5 am. I stayed at Planet Hollywood and had decided to go downstairs for some late night gambling. These creepy young guys were following me around the casino floor trying to talk to me. I tried to ignore them and kept walking around and around until I thought they had finally left me alone. When I thought I was in the clear, I sat down at a machine and had barely begun to play when another creeper came up and started trying to talk to me. I kept ignoring him and looking the other way and he didn't seem to get it. Out of nowhere, the security guy came and asked for the guy's ID and told him he was to leave since he did not have his ID on him. I turned to the security guy and mouthed ""Thank you"" to him. I had no idea but he came back shortly and told me that he had personally escorted that guy out of the casino! I thanked him again and I wanted to give him a hug (but I didn't- wasn't sure how appropriate that was) for being so attentive and responsive to the situation that I was not sure how to get out of, and all without me even having to tell him!! He was my hero for the night! Thank you for making me feel so safe!!",3,0,3

We drove up to have the valet take our car to be screamed at by the valet - literally yelling at us.  A few mins later another valet turned toward me to spit in a trash can at the entrance.  WTF?  First impressions last PH.

This place is dated, furniture is uncomfortable, chipped and in serious need of updating.  Windows were so dirty we couldn't see the supposed ""amazing"" view of the strip that we paid for - yeah the window was 1.5 yards long at best and you could only see the strip from a weird angle.  One armchair in the King Hip Rooms that is so uncomfortable I couldn't even sit in it.

No minibar.  No robes.  No cell coverage.  Wireless wasn't working - for the ONE device they allowed you to connect to. 

Then there was housekeeping barging into our room @ 9am Christmas morning.  I mean really?  

All that and not to mention the $22.48 we were charged for the resort fee - INSANE.

As for the casino - trashy is the best word for it.  Whoever does the wardrobe for the dancers should re-think it.  If they are going for trashy and cheap, they nailed it.  If edgy was the desired effect they FAILED.  I mean I get it's Vegas but really ... trashy dump is all that springs to mind.  The overall styling.  Ick.  I mean come on, style with girls in mind - let them keep their self-respect at least rather have them look like trashy skanks falling out of their tops and several not-so-toned and bloated tummys on display for all to see.

We normally stay at The Hotel @ Mandalay Bay, will definitely NOT make the mistake of going to PH again.  Seriously, check out Mandalay Bay, SO MUCH BETTER.

You have to factor in price, convenience (if you're attending a certain show, nightclub, pool party, etc.), amenities, restaurants, style, and ambiance. Now I've stayed at my share of Vegas hotels; at least two dozen different hotels off and on the strip ever since first coming to Sin City back in the 1990's. However, this was my first time ever staying at ""Planet Hollywood"".

Out of all the hotels on the strip, I would have to say that Planet Hollywood (formerly the Aladdin from 1966-2007) is an average and middle-of-the-road hotel. Meaning that it is not a bare bones\/no-frills place nor is it an over-the-top elaborate type of place. My lady and I booked a weekend stay here from Thursday 9\/28\/17 to Sunday 10\/1\/17. The primary reason we stayed here is because we bought tickets for Calvin Harris (at nearby Caesars Palace) for Friday night and tickets for Jennifer Lopez (who performs below at the Axis @ Planet Hollywood) for Saturday night. 

The prices here can vary greatly depending on when you book and which website\/travel agent company you do business with. We got a fairly good deal and the entire check-in process was very painless. Since we rented a car and drove into Las Vegas, the valet service was very quick and attentive. We both decided to take our carry-on luggage without the hotel staff's help. Upon entering, we checked-in through the touchscreen computers and our key cards were distributed through the computer.

The room we got (which was on the 18th floor) was non-smoking and had a comfy California King sized bed. There was a 40"" flat screen TV with just a few channels, mini refrigerator, study area, and an excellent view of the Las Vegas strip. The bathroom itself offered a walk-in shower as well as a whirlpool tub. Since I didn't smell or see anything out of the ordinary, we were both pleasantly surprised with our hotel experience. However, one gripe I have is their Wi-Fi. When you pay quite a bit of money for the hotel itself + resort fees + taxes, this should at least be included. Not at Planet Hollywood! They charge almost $15 for high speed internet.

A few things outside of the hotel room are ice machines on each floor (which surprisingly worked good), the ""Pleasure Pool"" (located on the 6th floor) that is open from 9am-7pm, a gym, a wedding chapel, conference\/meeting rooms, and a fairly generous casino area. Planet Hollywood also offers the ""Miracle Mile"" shops that include a huge variety of popular retailers. There is also a ton of excellent dining options including ""Gordon Ramsay Burger"", ""Koi"", ""P.F. Chang's"", ""Spice Market Buffet"", and ""Strip House Steakhouse"". And finally, ""AXIS"" is the auditorium that has amazing musicians such as Jennifer Lopez, Lionel Richie, and Britney Spears.

Overall, ""Planet Hollywood"" is the place where you can get the Los Angeles type of vibe. That is mainly what it focuses on. As every hotel on the Las Vegas strip has their own uniqueness to it, you definitely get a lot of options here. The crowd here is definitely younger since it has more of a hip feel to it. But when you factor in the cleanliness of the rooms, accessibility, price, and food options, Planet Hollywood is definitely worth checking out.

As I mentioned, my lady and I had an amazing view of the strip. As wonderful as our trip and stay were, we checked out of our hotel just hours before the massacre that occurred on the evening of 10\/1\/17. With that said and done, I wanted to express my deepest condolences to all 58 people that tragically lost their lives during this senseless attack on innocent concertgoers. Even though this was a very horrific event, it will not stop me from visiting Las Vegas.",9,3,6

The elevators are colored differently and we took pictures in each one, lolz.  It's a located at a convenient spot in the middle of the strip.  

The desert shops are closeby so you can indulge in shopping without having to go far.  The minimum blackjack table is $10.

1) Two words: BED BUGS

First off let me say that I've worked in the hospitality industry as a guest service agent, so I understand what its like to be on the other side.

The management team needs to be trained on how to deal with circumstances like bed bugs, which can easily start infesting new locations if they aren't eradicated correctly. 

My friend did call the ""Risk Management"" number that was given to her after we filed a complain. She was reimbursed $200, which is better than nothing, I guess.

2) ANOTHER issue that my friends and I had was the amount of different channels we had to go through for just a simple Lost and Found question.  

We went to the Spice Market buffet for brunch and my friend left her sunglasses at our table.  She called directly to the buffet and asked if anyone turned in a pair of sunglasses and whoever answered quickly transferred her over to the lost and found office for the WHOLE hotel AND she was put on hold for about 10 minutes only to get an answering machine.

Next day, after our bed bug scare we decided to go back to Spice Market and check if my friend's glasses were at the cash register. LO-and-BEHOLD in like 5 seconds they bring out her sunglasses. Seriously guys...

Maybe it's because their a big hotel..I don't know, but I was not impressed with my stay here.

I have stayed up and down the strip but I usually end up  across the street at Bellagio.

The positives:

-By far the hottest girls on the strip and not just the patrons but also the dealers and waitresses.  On par with the palms and hard rock except its smack in the middle of the strip.  The talent is definitely here!

-location, location, location.

-The sportsbook is not grand and rather limited but the director and staff were great and extremely accomodating.  I would recommend this place to any horse player as they really know how to take care of us.  

-Great vibe.  The place pumps the best music all day and the atmosphere  is vibrant and festive.  

Okay, the no so good:

-Restaurants are not good and striphouse is very bad.  Go across the street and eat at bellagio.  I dont know how you can screw up a buffet but they managed to as this is very bad.

-Pool is terrible.  Its like swimming in jail if prison had a pool.  

-Bathrooms.  Showers look like leftovers from alladin days.  Rooms are average.

-layout-  I got lost every day.  Again, not their fault as they are doing the best they can from Alladin days.

Bottom line?  If you want luxury and pampering with all of the finest amenities and creature comforts, go to wynn or bellagio.

2) got to the room and it was 80+ degrees. Cranked the A\/C way down - left the room for a few hours l, got back and still warm. Didn't get the room to cool down till the next morning

3) beds were comfortable but the pillows were lumpy and hard in places.

4) the rooms are extremely dated and the furniture is in rough shape, looks like they got it at a flea market

5) tvs were horrible 

6) one ply toilet paper?!??? Really?

7) bathrooms remind me of my local gym
Having said this- views were outstanding

This place reminded me of going to spring break in college and having to get a cheap room at a motel 6 or something. If places like these exist on the strip I can't imagine what's off the strip

I've been coming to Vegas since I was 12 (apparently my parents are comedians) and always enjoyed the atmosphere and environment. We've always spent our stays in Planet Hollywood. For my sister's 21st it was a big deal to go and stay with our family and friends (there were at least 19 of us). After our stay back in July for said occasion, we're no longer making Planet Hollywood part of that. Customer service is non existent. From the looks of other reviews it's apparent. 

Long story short, accidents happen but how a business moves forward, shows how they care and keep guest continuity. A pipe burst during our stay on 7\/8 - 7\/10, flooding the lobby and casino levels. My guests and I were in the North Tower where the elevators were shut off prompting 35- an hour wait time to go up and down elevators in the South Tower. We were on a quick schedule and because of the waits we were forced to attempt to maneuver the stairs up twenty flights when the flooding first started to make it to a 7:30 birthday reservation. My friend is claustrophobic and there is no air ventilation in the stair well and it is also tightly enclosed. My friend had a panic attack halfway up. We missed my sister's bday reservation. We were behind schedule for our whole two day stay. There was no communication on what was happening. Just flooding and that the South Tower elevators were only operational. This was also my significant other's first time in Vegas and this was his experience: unorganized, unprofessional and more work than a vacation. I am in customer service myself and tried not to let the whole experience way down on me; until I wrote them after coming home (since talking to any hotel personnel while the flooding happened was not possible because so many people were upset and I didn't want to further that). So I emailed them after with a detailed letter of what happened and hoping for some sort of solace, refund or future credit to make up for this incident. To my dismay, I was only responded with a generic response of how the engineer department worked very hard (which no one said they didn't), and thanks for letting them know. Nothing to rectify the inconvenience AND guilting the guests for how hard the engineer department worked while neglecting their hospitality skills. Of course the engineer department worked hard! Thank goodness for them! I wasn't writing the engineer department, I was writing the guest services and hotel billing for paying for services that were not in service. 

Any way, that response prompted me to send the same letter to get a refund from the billing department cause honestly when you pick to stay at a hotel, it's for its services, amenities, etc. No service was being done for me and more than half the amenities weren't accessible. I sent that second email to billing the same day I got the generic response back on 7\/17 and still have not heard anything back nor have I been refunded. 

Guess this was not a long story so short but mostly the gist of everything. I suppose it's time to check out other hotels since our loyal patronage has been abandoned.",1,1,1

From the minute we walked in, our rooms were not even ready [Granted, we checked in early], but they told us we can have a handicap room or smoking. After reading reviews, I didnt want either of these rooms because I had heard complaints. So instead we decided to go eat breakfast and come back to see if the room is ready. When we came back about 2 hrs later, still no room. So we opted for smoking.

Once we arrived to the room, it looked dirty. But I didnt complain. When you sit on the edge of the bed, the whole mattress goes up! The pillowy tile decor on the walls were peeling off! The bathroom smelled funny. The TV had no HBO or anything of substance [Not that we went there to watch TV, its just the principle]. No mini bar. No robe. Practically NO LIGHTING. Room was very dark and dim. And 2 lights didnt even work! The front desk rarely answered the phone.

I had to pay $159 for a late check out! For only 4 hrs extra! At the Bellagio, I only paid $80!!!   They would not negotiate on this at all, regardless that our maid broke an antique mirror I had brought with me. 

Pros: 
     -Location [On strip, Miracle Mile shops]
     -Pink's, Earl of Sandwich, Planet Dailies

My boyfriend and I needed a place to stay for the night while we were in town. This place had pretty good rates and there was no resort fee, so it seemed like a no-brainer. Well, if we only knew! We get to the hotel, find parking and get completely confused trying to find the actual resort from the parking structure. We had to walk through the miracle mile shops and navigate our way to, then through the casino and to the front desk.
When we got our key and made it to our room it was a total nightmare. They put us in the BackDraft room, on the 22nd floor!! What genius thought of that?! I don't know about you but I don't want to think about a movie involving fires 22 floors up. The furniture was dark and oppressive, the window shade was broken and the shower was dirty. Thankfully I had my handy bottle of Lysol ready. The mattress was dirty and did not have a mattress cover, just a sheet folded over it. Needless to say, we slept on top of the covers. When I turned on the heater, a burnt smell came out of it and it started blowing cold air. I made a call to the front desk and a maintenance guy promptly came to the door to check it out. He said the thermostats are new, so to keep it running for 30 mins or so and it should heat up and he would be back to check. Well, he never came back and that damn thing stayed on all night blowing out cold air. You can bet we were up early and checked out with bells on. If that heater is on, I'm sure it still hasn't warmed up. Stay here if you like, but you have been warned! Just make sure you bring extra blankets and Lysol!",4,2,0

I like Planet Hollywood for the location on the strip and the fact that it's connected to a mall with shopping, shows, and restaurants. They also seem to cater to a younger crowd and they have good acts here- uh Britney, obvi! The front entrance and parts of the hotel have allot of pow and pizzazz, making it feel very Vegas-y.

But for the price of my stay, I thought my room could've been cleaner and better kept - I'm pretty sure the vacuum had never seen the underside of the desk. The carpeting throughout the hotel was dingy and rolling up as well; it was pretty tacky actually. Also, the rooms could've had a little more punch to the decor. Between the rooms here and rooms at the Hard Rock, who also does a rock-n-roll\/celebrity artifacts type of theme, Hard Rock was way better done. I also liked the casino in The Hard Rock better than PH. Oh, and basically any place has a pool better than Planet Hollywood. Like my neighbor here in Michigan has a nicer pool in his backyard than this place. PH's pool is like a concrete wasteland. There weren't even plants around the pool to liven it up.  They sort-of made up for it by having a second rate Pauly D DJ and after a few (overpriced) drinks, it wasn't too bad of an afternoon. 

I probably wouldn't stay here again but I suppose it's not the absolute worst either. So if you are coming for the shows and a basic pool set-up meets your needs, you'll be ok.",1,0,0

Other casinos has some dealers dressed in that way but not all. That didn't really give off a good impression upon me.

Aside from the ego boost you might get from the underworked ""working girls"" the poker room was unfriendly and and the slots don't pay enough to let you dream that you might win enough to cover the free beer you just tipped for. 
The pool was freezing!!!!
$37 for a resort fee. This includes 2 devices for wifi and $14 each additionsl device. We being a family of 4 had to draw straws for device privileges.  There were no amenities to use however because we were determined to use the pool we went back down at 7pm to find out they close the pool early if no one is in it.....
Hmmmm..... Guessing they close early every day. Not sure why you want to close early when you can charge $17 per cocktail. 
The room was not dirty dirty but not exactly clean.

Upon arrival and check-in, one of the rooms were not cleaned.  Called front desk which told us to talk to housekeeping.  Housekeeping said that they would not clean the room because it was past a certain time...the room did not get cleaned till 5 hours later...Had to call several times and get the run around!  

Another issue MAJOR issue occurred was that there was not any hot water!  Halfway through my shower it went from hot to cold!  luckily we had another room to use and there was hot water.  This happened 2 of the 3 days there...  

Some smaller issues.  Busted toilet!  Ended up having a toilet that kept running\/flushing.  We told housekeeping and nothing was done.  3 days running water.  The hotel asks patrons to conserve energy and water and doesn't do anything to wasting water.  The tv in one of the other rooms had poor quality and the picture was over extended.  you could not tell what channel you were on because it was not properly displayed.  also the volume on the tv was just loud! one room was fine.

Starting with the rooms: They are decent size rooms, although I have only stayed in the ones with the king beds, they are very comfortable and spacious. The bathrooms are large with their own shower stall, separate jacuzzi tub, and toilet also separate. There is also a large counter and sink, perfect for multiple people to get ready.

The Bellagio is right across the street, so you don't even have to leave the room to watch the fountain show or fight for a good spot! The rooms are themed from famous actors or singers and they have some cool memorabilia for show.

Casino: I really like that the decorations are vibrant pink hue colors and crystals all over the lighting, it is very appealing to me being a very feminine lady. Over the one section of the blackjack tables is called the Pleasure Pit, all it is are go go dancers in pink costumes dancing. Sometimes they look like they're having fun and into it, and some girls look like they want a new job (liven up, ladies!) other than that, your typical updated, run of the mill casino.

One incident that prevented me from giving this resort five stars was that there elevators were on the fritz one evening and no one could even find the stairs from the casino level to their rooms so some of us waited forever.  I just went back to the slots and wasted hundreds and hundreds more (pennies).

The restaurants at the resort were pretty good but the shopping mall on the main level was extremely handy.  

This place doesn't look like much from the strip because the casino and pool sort of prevent any sort of stunning entrance like the neighbours across the street or down the street but inside PH is quite nice.

I love the Miracle Mile shops and it's across from the Cosmopolitan and Paris hotel which has great restaurants. I stayed in the PH Tower suite, 2 bedroom, 2 bath, kitchen, living --- a really great suite.

What I didn't like was the front desk service and the pool bar service. Front desk was really slow, and the lady that helped us check in spoke really low, and would not bring up her volume after I told her that I couldn't hear her. 

The pool service was ok, it took us 45 minutes to get our food. I've stayed at several different hotels and it usually takes 25 minutes. I wasn't pleased with the wait and had to check on the food twice. And then when it came out 2 of our hot wing orders were really cold. By the time I realized it, the guy who brought it out was already gone.

The casino is pretty decent, they have gogo dancers at the BlackJack tables, and from 9pm till midnight there was really awesome cover band playing at the bar. The Spice Market buffet was really good. Also the hotel is walking distance from Caesars, Bellagio, Aria , Paris and other great Casinos and attractions. Great location and the rooms rates were reasonable. 

But that is not the reason this hotel gets a 2 star from me. Our room was on the 7th floor, on the 2nd night we woke up to the sound of fire alarms at 3AM. We rushed out to the corridor and we ran into a lot of sleepy confused people in the hallway, some people were trying to take the elevator to the ground floor... bad idea... we tried to stop them.. but they went anyway. Almost the entire floor rushed down the fire exits to the safety. We  then walked to the checkin counter and alerted the casino staff that the fire alarm just went off... they seemed oblivious to the fact, they did not even know that their hotel fire alarm just went off. We found out the fire alarm was set on the 7th and 8th floor, so there were hotel customers from both floor trying to tell the hotel staff that they need to check it out for fire. The hotel staff at the checkin did not seem to be worried about it. Few people claimed that they saw smoke on the 8th floor, finally one of the cleaning ladies said it might be a false alarm. The hotel staff still did not want to even acknowledge that the alarm was tripped much less there is possibility of a fire! After a while some of us got tired of waiting around for the hotel staff to respond  to our requests and we went back to our rooms. The fire alarm had stopped by the time we got to 7th floor. I think the staff responded in the most irresponsible and negligent manner. I am never going to stay at the hotel again, they have no concern for their customer's safety.",1,3,0

In some ways, you can't really blame the staff but more the property. I'd be rude and unprofessional too if you had to listen to dance music at full blast for 8 hours a day. I don't know what PH is thinking. Needlessly to say, my experience with most of the staff was negative and they are not definitely 4 1\/2 stars.

The bathtub was beautiful and I enjoyed the cleanliness and plentiful room in the standard double. (I think its called the Hit Room) I was a little confused by the lack of fitted sheets, but the bed was comfortable. 

The bad: I booked this room through the convention and just paid the prices listed without doing any kind of comparison. I have attended several other conventions organized by this company and we have always received the best rates - even in New Orleans and Savannah. It came to our attention that the entire convention was being bowled over and the attendees were being it told a variety of information on why the hotel was so expensive. Whatever. The bottom line is this: if you are planning a convention DO NOT USE THIS HOTEL. There was another convention at the same chain (Caesars) but several other hotels. They were paying $30 - $120 (depending on the day of the week) our convention rates were $140-$189. This is crazy. If this hotel plans on being competitive and retaining guests - this is NOT the way to do it. My next trip will certainly be with another chain in Vegas. 

The convention area is severely outdated and I kept expecting the Red Hat society to pop up at any minute. Did they fund this color scheme??? 

Check in was insane. I pre-checked in since I was coming in so late and was in a hurry. Yet, the key-pickup line was not being attended. The ladies waiting were obviously being ignored, so I just waited in the regular check-in line with everyone else. The attendant didn't explain anything about the hotel, their services, or the casino. No one ever mentioned the Total Rewards program and discounts it provides - so thank you for that hotel staff. Nor did anyone mention Jeff Dunham. (And yes I know he was on the keys and all that - but the days he plays or prices were not brought up) You would think they would be trying to sell the tickets to the show, but apparently not or maybe the clerk did not have the ability to multi-task. 

To sum it up - I would not book this hotel if returning.",1,0,0

I usually visit every other month, and I am by no means a ""high roller"".  I do use the casino's ""players card"" when I do gamble and get plenty of free stuff.  For this visit, I was invited to stay for the weekend at Planet Hollywood, and also got a $150 shopping credit at Gucci.  How can I pass that up?

I've stayed at most of the other Caesar's Entertainment properties except for Planet Hollywood and the Cromwell.  Now, I can check that off my list.  The parking entrance is located off Harmon, not off Las Vegas Boulevard. From there, you can select parking for the Miracle Mile, self parking or the valet. Parking is no longer free, unless you are a platinum card holder or higher.  Fortunately I am platinum, and I get help by using the Total Rewards credit card to qualify.

My free room was originally on the 7th floor, overlooking the pool.  I asked to be placed in a higher floor due to the pool noise, and thankfully I was moved. Even on the 22nd floor, the noise of the thumpa-thumpa music reached up to my room. The room was nicer than I anticipated, quite spacious and had a desk area, a table, and a chaise lounge. Unfortunately, there's no mini bar but they do give you an empty fridge to store whatever drinks you want from downstairs.  They also provide a coffee maker and an ice bucket.

The bathroom was nice and spacious, and even reminded me of the Cosmopolitan. We had a deep sunken bathtub, a walk in shower, and 2 sinks... not side by side but across from each other, giving us plenty of personal space.

The view wasn't bad, and overlooked the pools from our hotel and I could also see the Cosmopolitan hotel's pool.  Not bad for ""free"".

It used to be the Aladdin but had its named changed to Planet Hollywood about 1 month ago.

Have not been inside the Aladdin in years since it was such a HO HUM and BORING casino and mall but I like the changes they have done to the place since it became Planet Hollywood (PH). PH is now a lot more happening, has more of a hip vibe and sound, and seems to be attracting more young people.

Good points: 
- got a free upgrade to one of their suite rooms - was too low to get a good view of the Strip but got a good view of the pool. Had a bathtub overlooking the pool with tv in the bathroom too along with a regular shower. Two sinks.
- conveniently attached to the mall with a lot of stores and restaurants
- now a Starwood hotel so you can get points 
- service was extremely attentive: (a) when there was a long line to check out, a PH lady came by to take out names and rooms down and she said she'd handle the checkout for us, (b) I asked for help to check in online for me and the guy was super nice and did it for me
- main taxi entrance is towards the back\/side roads so easier to take the side roads to the airport and to the other casinos while avoiding Las Vegas Blvd traffic.
- prices seem a bit lower than other casinos right now due to the transition

Not so good points:
- pool area was very boring. Basically two rectugular pools on top of some of the PH buildings on the 6th floor. Decor was definitely lacking.
- the suite we were was big and pretty cool but strangely angular
- lots of construction happening all around PH as a part of its facelift and the new PH condos around it
- still a lot of remant middle eastern themed items\/decorations around at this point from the Aladdin days so they may seem out of place.

Bottom line: So glad they are giving the Aladdin a new face and attitude. The PH is a decent place to stay with friendly service. Lots of changes and construction happening but conveniently located. If a cool pool is important to you, this is not the place to go.",3,0,1

It's open, but still got a lot of work to do.

The lobby is beautiful, but understated... I'm a big fan of all the crystal chandeliers.

The renovation of the casino was well thought out.  Card tables, roulette, lounges, etc. gives a great vibe.  Color scheme is on the masculine side, but the bling bling really makes up for it.  (Hey, it's Vegas, what do you expect?)

The Spice Market Buffet... the reason why I'm yelping... is the epitome of Vegas buffets.  It's really priced well.  There's many selections to choose from.  Every item cooked to perfection.  Servers and staff are quick to respond.  My favorite entree was the cook-to-order crepes.  Because of this place, we'll always go to PH when we visit.  

Next time, we'll try to stay on property... hopefully the renovation is complete by then... and maybe the rating will be a 5???",0,0,0

BAD CHOICE.  1.  45 minute wait to check in with only 3 working the desk.  No apology, just a sorry its busy and most of our help called in.  Like they didn't know how many reservations were on the books.  2.  Dropping $1500 in 36 hours on video poker, and didn't even get one 4 of a kind.   OMG.  3.  I left my $49 memory foam pillow and cell charger in the room.  Since I am local I could run down and pick it up.  I would know if I didn't take my pillow home with me.  After 15 minutes on hold I get to Lost and Found.  They don't have it.  They send me to housekeeping where I wait another 15 minutes on hold and they say why did they even transfer me there.  That Lost and Found should have offered a security report which they did not.  And I get offered to be transferred back.  After a long wait time I hung up.
5.  Long wait times for the buffet (1.5 hours quoted) for a $35.99 buffet.  6.  only 2 bath towels for 2 people, are you kidding?  7.  No exhaust fans in the bathroom?  8.  Shower so tiny with a shower head that is not movable.... cant escape the water to even shave your legs.  The little things that make a stay ""uncomfortable"".

I love this hotel by far. I been to probably all the other popular hotels on the strip and by far the best place to host a Vegas trip with 10+ people. 

You got to get the two bedroom suites. It's so spacious! Two queen beds, pull out bed, and chairs where you can sleep. It seriously can fit 10+ people comfortably. 

I love the projector they have and the big speaker we use to blast our music. 

Location is money as well. Easy cabbing\/limo access and close to every popular club. 

Parking is so close to hotel entrance and is free. 

I don't like how they strict on hotel keys, but they give out unlimited amounts anyways. Before they were not strict, but now it's one hotel key for a group of 4 people. 

I will definitely be back and probably booking this place for Halloween!",2,2,1

The hotel is located in the heart of The Strip, so it's convenient and easy to get around and find things to do.

For the most part, i had a nice stay.  Housekeeping does a good job of cleaning everything.  I personally witnessed 2 women clean up a suite left behind by a group of young gents --- the mess was Gi-normous --- they went to work and after a couple of hours it looked like new.   

My one challenge with this hotel was the pool and it's surrounding areas.   The pool chairs were significantly old & dirty and the pool felt like a bucket of ice cold water that never got warm.  There was a sectioned off section of the pool deck with beautiful, brand new chairs but no one seemed to know how to get into that section. 

I understand it's Vegas and folks are allowed to smoke everywhere (fine w\/ that) but the hotel could use air fresheners and febreeze EVERYWHERE, especially in their restrooms.  It's 2015 -- there is no reasons for  BAD SMELLS to be allowed with everything that is out there now.

Last note, the waitresses at the pool were s-l-o-w.  One afternoon I waited close to an hour for a menu.  Not fun.

Areas for improvement: please update your cable selections, smell, pool chairs, pool, pool!

I'm giving it 3 stars for location, good customer service and their beds (super comfy).

 I hope this helped!",3,0,0

The room was really dusty and wasn't cleaned properly so had to change rooms (and this wasn't any better). There was no kettle\/complimentary tea & coffee (basic amenity in my books - even 3* hotels provide that). No fridge\/mini bar. Only one wardrobe which I had to share with my friend. The hinge on the bathroom door was broken and hanging off, the tap on the bath was also broken. To top things off the shower was non adjustable and definitely needed de-scaling as water was spraying everywhere.  Just generally not what I expect for 4*. It seems very glamorous in the lobby however - lots of lights and pazazz - but it ends there. No tourist information section\/map\/leaflets etc either. 

The only positives - very comfy bed and the room had a safe. 

I would definitely not stay here again as I was really disappointed.",8,1,1

Pools are a good size and there's lots of tanning spaces, not much shade unless you rent a bed or cabana. The casino there is nice as well as the surrounding mall there is lots of stores and restaurants. We booked three rooms, one was upgraded free of charge to the penthouse floor (51st) our room was on the 50th which was extra spacious. Double sinks, bigger bathroom, and a bigger seating area. The third room was supposed to be a a smoking room but due to lack of availability they didn't have one til the next day. This room was on the 38th floor originally and the hallways and rooms on this floor are beautiful, very modern and new looking, I liked it better than the 50th room even though it was a lot bigger, the 38th looked much better. We had to move rooms the next day as well because our room on the 50th smelled like weed and got a whole lot worse the next day which was very unpleasant and made all our clothes smell. Eventually all three rooms were moved to the 51st floor free of charge and free of hassle which was very convenient for us. Our booking came with free Starbucks for breakfast (9$ each person in the room) and you can choose whatever you wanted to order, this was great. It also came with free flow rider tickets for each person which was really fun, but be sure to book in advance because the spots fill up pretty quickly. We rented a cabana which was much cheaper at the kid pool instead of the adult pool, and almost the exact same. Anything you order at the hotel (cabana, room service, pool service) has an 18% service fee or gratuity fee already charged and also has a second line to add gratuity as well. When we asked about this I was told that the 18% gets split amongst that team of people and the second gratuity line you can add is to tip your specific server directly. Beds in the room were very comfortable, rooms clean, bathrooms have tv's which is nice, bathtubs were very deep and relaxing, fridge and tv was a good size. We only had one issue with our shower not turning on, maintenance took about 40 mins to get to the room and another 15-20 to fix it. The bathroom smelled funky after because the mould behind the shower handle was exposed, they sent housekeeping to come replace all our towels and get rid of the smell which took another 30 mins. Otherwise everything else was good. Front desk was very helpful and willing to solve our issues with ease. Rooms also had a doorbell and a do not disturb setting on the higher floors which I thought was really cool.",1,0,0

We were shopping around for an affordable spot that would also be on the strip. In our plans, we had figured we would use what money we saved from living at a more affordable location on the delicious food, shows and... well, liquor. 

What's hot about the place? Even if you decide to just stay in at Planet Hollywood there is a ton of stuff to do. Earl of Sandwich, the casino, lots and lots of other cool shopping spots. It's also very close to Paris and the other big named locations. And most definitely a great price. Within the rooms, the blinds are amazing -- you could wake up and not know the sun was out. The brilliance of Vegas hotel interior designs, I suppose. 

What's not? It's quite minimal. We had to venture out to the Wynn and Cosmo for some fancier stuff. You get what you pay for.

I was skeptical at first, I mean it is Planet Hollywood, and a few years back they had problems managing their brand and restaurants, so I had real doubts about how the hotel and casino experience will be.

However this trip was short notice and one of my friends had just stayed there a week or two before, and told me it wasn't too bad for the price. Well three of us (more like the girl who ended up planning this trip) scored a room with two queen beds for $134 a person or $402 for two days. Personally, I've paid less and more for hotels in Vegas, but for being a newly renovated room, I couldn't complain.

Our room was on the 31st floor and had a lovely view of the airport, the condo towers going up behind the hotel, and if you stood on the far left end of the window, you could see part of the MGM Grand. The beds were comfortable, although the comforters had an overly sheeny cover that had a tendency to slide off the bed during the night...which would be nice if you wanted them off and not sleeping, but on this Vegas trip, sleep was the bed activity of choice. A decent sized plasma screen dominated the room, but when you took all furniture into account, the area was on the cramped side. The washroom was equipped with a two person jacuzzi tub, a stand-up shower with glass door, and a closet sized room holding an enclosed toilet, thrown in the most asinine layout possible, with semi private, slated, fold-out doors more suitable for a living room window then a hotel washroom. Unless you're pretty open with your friends, what could've been a useful two person in the washroom at one time layout, ends up wasting alot of potential room space.

But this is Vegas and you shouldn't stay in your room unless you have to, so let me move on. The casino area is tastefully done, with colorful overhead light panels, and a carpet pattern that could've been borrowed from a Windows 98 screen saver. Game tables dominate the middle of the floor, with slots occupying the rest. Part of the southern entrance area is still under construction, but the doors are still usable.

Lobby and registration is on the lower level and feels kinda cramped despite having colorful displays of light all around. On the brightside, taxis and limos drive out and away from the LV Boulevard, enabling you to make a quick dash away from the strip without having to wait for lights, traffic, or absent minded tourists from blocking your way. This does work against you though, as taxis may not be inclined to make the long way around to the back, when they can have an easier time getting a fare from hotels that have taxi lanes easily accessbile from the boulevard.

Speaking of accessible, one thing I do have to say is ""Thank You"" to PH for improving the walking space available to pedestrians walking by the building. I don't feel like I am being funnelled inside the building when I walk by, at least not as much.

If still want to see traces of the old Aladdin, goto the shopping area where the Middle-Eastern theme still is in place in most of the mall. The stores range from your typical LV tourist trinket stores, to shops like the Gap. Some highend and lowend stores occupy the space as well. It remains to be seen how PH handles the redevelopment of the mall area. It has the potential to go classy or trashy depending on what stores go in after all is said and done.

Pros: Newly renovated rooms, casino area, facade, walk-ways, etc. Almost perfect location, taxi-ways avoid LV Blvd traffic when leaving to the airport.

Cons: Renovations are a work in progress, old Aladdin mall leaves something to be desired. The final atmosphere of this hotel is still up in the air.

To sum it up: If you're a skeptic like me, give it a try if you find a good deal. The almost perfect location will make you forget what you paid for anyway.",0,0,0
