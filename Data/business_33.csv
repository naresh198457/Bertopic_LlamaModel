This place came up so we stopped by it before we headed home. I am so glad we did. When we pulled in there was a line of people outside waiting. Despite the line we only waited 10-15 minutes to be seated. The menu was bigger than I thought. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs. I didn't take a picture of it normally because I was 3 or 4 bites deep before I realized I didn't take a picture. The portions were large and the food came out fast. The wifey said she loved the banana muffin. I didn't get it. I can't give an honest opinion about the muffin because I don't enjoy muffins. Back to the portions, they were so huge this chubby boy couldn't finish it. The potatoes were seasoned just right and not overly covered in seasoning. I am picky about my gravy and it compares well with my aunts gravy. This place is a no fluff breakfast joint. Highly recommended!",0,0,0

The decor of this breakfast house really caught my attention as I first walked in. Eggs are featured on everything from their tableware, to their menu, and their walls. It's too adorable. The menu looks like a real newspaper which is also a nice little touch to the theme of this restaurant. Bright yellow everywhere is a great way to brighten up and start your day in Vegas!

We went to Egg & I for brunch and I can say it loud and proud, this is the best American breakfast I have ever had. Hearty, filling, innovative, more than just eggs and waffles. Egg & I has taken breakfast foods to a whole different level. I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine (featured on Rachel Ray) which had  spinach, canadian bacon, two poached eggs on a grilled english muffin, with hollandaise sauce. We also ordered an omelette, Both served with ranch potatoes...by far the best breakfast potatoes on this planet. I forgot the name of the omelette, but I know for sure I'd order the eggs benedict florentine and extra banana nut muffins on the side. The complimentary banana nut muffins are made fresh in house, and they are SO GOOD. The service was just as bubbly and friendly as this restaurant is. If you want to start your day right in Vegas, this is definitely one of your options.

The lasting impression? ""Love my breakfast, let's get it on country style at Egg & I!",14,10,10

Came by for breakfast to try one of my favorite breakfast dishes, chicken fried steak. I had ""Brad's corned beef hash"" the first time, kinda salty..

And Of course, it wasn't hard to choose, ""toast or banana nut muffin"".. Is this a trick question? haha, banana nut muffin, please! Muffin was Awesome just not as warm and moist as the first time. There were many more customers dining this day and maybe they were a little busy and in a rush making them? 

Chicken Fried Steak: Nice portion with a good amount of gravy, I went with egg whites only and their seasoned potatoes. The steak had the right crunchy skin, meat was perfect and their sausage gravy was mild and heart warming. In my opinion, much better dish than their corned beef hash.

This is a fun place to eat. That is, it is a fun place to eat if you can get a table as they are oftentimes very-very crowded -- especially in the morning.  On those hot summer Vegas days I see people waiting outside but I don't know... That is just not for me. When you want to go is before the weekend AM crowds have hit or on the off-hours. Then, walking in and getting a table is very easy. 

Okay, now that the warnings have bee spelled out, let's get down to the restaurant. Inside, it is very Americana. Plus, the food is very Americana. Basically, what you see is what you get. 

Ordering is easy. As the name of the restaurant suggests, it is eggs and things that go along with eggs. Simply as that. Make your choice and you are all good. 

The staff is always nice and helpful is you have any questions. And, most of the times the other guest are nice though I have been here a few times when the restaurant was deluged with a rowdy or rude crew, however. But hey, this is Vega, what can you expect? 

Eggs & I is attached to a large shared parking lot. I have never found parking to be a problem. 

It is located on West Sahara, so finding it is easy.

Food: I ordered the stuffed French toast $10.50. This thing is fully loaded. It's French toast stuffed with scrambled eggs with cheese and I chose, turkey sausage. However you can choose any of these, ham, bacon or sausage. It also comes with a side of potatoes squares. They have large portions and vast selection of items on the menu.

The service was quick and respectful and the food was a savory spectacle. 

We were a group of six arriving at peak brunch hour and we were seated in less than 5 minutes. Our dining experience began when we checked in on Yelp to get a free batch of their acclaimed banana nut muffins. Our server served them to us warm and they were perfect to peak our appetites for what was to be a massive, hearty breakfast. I ordered my own creation of the The Works skillet with country gravy on top while the rest of my group tried different variations of the Eggs Benny. The country gravy was the best I've ever had and the fresh ingredients in the rest of the skillet balanced the whole meal out. I was impressed with my friend's Eggs Bennies as well. You really can't beat their brunch especially at their modest prices.

Was in Vegas and wanted some breakfast that doesn't come with the word ""Buffet"" attached to it. Looked up on Yelp and found this little gem.

It's around a 10minute drive from the Strip, without traffic of course.

I ordered the Crazy Chicken omelet with the muffin. They leave the whole carafe of coffee on your table, saving yourself from waving down a waiter(ess) every time you want a refill.

The omelet itself was very tasty, the muffin, while not as heavenly as some others claim, was indeed very moist and tasty and worth a try. The potato that came was what made my day. The fried squared shaped potato was crispy on the outside, but still mushy on the inside! Such a delight!

The corned beef hash comes with ranch potatoes (think Tommys style fries with that red seasoning only diced up), eggs, and a side of watermelon and pineapple. The hash was served under scrambled eggs in a skillet. The ranch potatoes were crisp and flavorful. I just wish the hash was a bit crispier. Since the hash was made with a mixture of potatoes, the texture remained soft and did not create any contrast with the scrambled eggs. It had good flavor though.

Menu items of note:
Crazy Chicken - simply a well balanced omelette

Eggs Benedict Florentine - not a fan of eggs benedict in general, but I am when I come here

Banana Nut Muffin - this thing might be enough of a reason to come here just by itself

Haole (sp?) loco - on the back page, under the Hawaiian section, it's one of the more fattening things on the menu, but very tasty.

Not a fan of their homefries, so I substitute them out with fruit instead

Service:
The servers are usually quite friendly, helpful, and attentive.

Reasons why I come here:
This is one of the cheaper and healthier breakfast options in Vegas, yet there is no sacrifice in quality for the food.  Much better than the overrated Hash House a Go Go.  Oh, and if you are coming here for the first time, do yourself a favor and get the darn Banana Nut Muffin.",1,0,1

1) Linnea went above and beyond when it came to serving. When we order she would ask additional questions like, would you like flavored creamers? And give additional recommendations towards the food choices.

2) Linnea would always check on us and see if we were doing good, always having a cheerful welcoming smile on her face and the way she talked made us feel very welcomed.

3) When there was a slight mistake, because my friend ordered steak and instead of eggs they wanted an omelet, which never happened before and Linnea brought out my stuff French toast and apologize for the confusion and mishap, that the steak was cooked inside the omelet and apologize for the confusion and wait... Which we didn't even wait long. About 3 minutes the steak and omelet was brought out immediately. Still apologizing... It didn't matter too much to us and for the fact that they were sincerely sorry. Wow what exceptional service.

I don't remember exactly what I got, but I think it was an omelette. Decent, but I didn't see what all the fuss was about and especially for a place that isn't cheap. Well, I'm glad I tried it again, because now I see more of what people have been talking about. I went with a party of 8 and the service was excellent. Someone recommended the stuffed French toast and although it didn't really sound like my kind of thing I ordered it. Well, I'm glad I did because that thing is awesome! Perfectly cooked eggs with the right amount of cheese and sausage. The French toast was done just right as well. So, I suppose it really depends on what you have here and what your tastes are.

Since we had a car this time in Vegas, we decided to get some brunch off the strip. We had a party of 3 and waited about 10-15 minutes before we got seated. My friend ordered the stuffed french toast, which was HUGE! The bf ordered the eggs benedict, which was not bad and good portions. I ended up ordering the egg-crepe, which was simiar to an omelette. Pretty good and not too heavy. 

What we loved the most was their banana nut muffin and ranch potatoes. O man, my mouth is watering just thinking about how light and tasty their banana nut muffin was. I could eat like 5 of those in 1 sitting. hahaha. =X We were all raving about how  the ranch potatoes were so flavorful. Plus, each dish had a big portion of it. I definitely wasn't complaining. 

Our waitress was very attentive, but not over-bearing. She told us if we needed something, we could just flip the little egg over to get her attention (reminded me of Bubba Gump's).

I can't seem to get myself to order anything but the Egg Crepes, I guess it's just because it's that good, not to mention, I can't order anything like it from anywhere else!  I forget which one I usually order, I think it's called the ""Collision"" or something?  It has mushrooms and bacon in it.

The Ranch Potatoes are like like Potato Chips, you can't help but pop one after the other, after the other, in your mouth.

But, it's not like I can finish it anyways, because of that damn freakin most delicious Banana Nut Muffin I have in the beginning.

Got hooked up on banana nut muffins with the check in. Deliciously moist and flavorful. 

So when deciding to order my buddy and i couldnt decide between the chile relleno omlete and the a south west type of omlete.. so we decided to order both and split it. Ya i know l, totally adorable.

Must say the chile relleno is soooooo good. Definitely filling and hit all the right marks. Not many places can make a good chile relleno entre, alertos is the only place in oc, imo, but eggs and i got it right.

The south west type was also a good omlete. Definitely tasted the different components but it was not as awe strucking as the chile relleno omlete.

Other things ordered at the table was a ""1\/2"" order of maple bacon french toast had a special type of syrup as well. This plate was a good addition to the overall meal. 

The gf ordered a carrot cake french toast. She said it was ok in comparison to the chile relleno omlete *cough cough*. But i need to be hoenst besides loving chile rellenos.. i love carrot cake! It was moist, similar texture as the banan nut muffin and with bits of carrots enough for texture. Definitely a fan. 

Besides great service with the food, out waitress was just as diligent with our questions in regards to this establishment's history.

Granted, I've only been here once, but I can't stop thinking about the delicious food I ate and how I wish we had this place in LA. 

I ordered the Chili Relleno omelet and the Country Benny. They had the option of ordering smaller portions of the skillets and omelet dishes which I really enjoyed because the portions were fairly large and I unfortunately can never finish my food, no matter how hard I try.

The Chili Relleno was so extremely flavorful, the omelet practically melted in my mouth. And the Country Benny, the gravy, the sausage, the biscuit... Mmmm! My eyes rolled back with every bite. I wanted to order the banana pancakes but I think I was getting ahead of myself. 

Our waitress, Carla, was amazing. She was very helpful and attentive, and definitely made my experience more enjoyable.

I will go to Vegas again just to eat here. Can't wait to come back!",3,0,1

The newspaper-style menu is a breakfast gazette of headlines - like carrot cake French toast, pork carnitas burritos, and just about every type of omelet and pancake you could ever imagine.

Liza was our fabulous hostess on our dining journey. This woman is the epitome of a multi-tasker, buzzing around and paying attention to every little detail, from the quality of our food to the assurance our glasses remained full... and even the fact that I was rubbing my arms and she instantly picked up that I was cold and turned the air conditioner up a few degrees, without me asking. 
This woman is amazing at customer service! 

All of our food came out together (for seven people) and it was all piping hot! We were never left unattended and were quite entertained at how Liza perfectly orchestrated her tables (including our own).

Some of the dishes at our table included:
* Stuffed French toast - like a deconstructed monte cristo with bacon; delicious!
* Vegetarian crepe - filled with veggie goodness.; so fresh and so clean-clean.
* The Classic - hot scrambled eggs, toast and ham - American style.
* Pork carnitas burrito - mexitastic pork in a verde sauce wrapped in a soft flour tortilla; to die for.
* Egg whites and short stack of buckwheat pancakes - both cooked with no oil...  I was trying to watch my caloric intake, and The Egg and I was happy to accommodate me.

I decided to get the Mexican Omelette - Chorizo, chiles and onions and cheese, topped with sour cream. Came with a heaping side of potatoes and choice of bread - I got wheat.

Overall I was kind of underwhelmed by the dish. Usually I love chorizo, but for some reason this omelette just did not meld like it should. 

Service was SLOW. Yes, it was busy on a Saturday, but there came a point when my husband looked up and said, ""Where's the food?"". Never a good sign when you actually start questioning whether or not they put the order in.

They did have a very yummy banana nut muffin, which I highly suggest getting if you come here. AND (as of this writing) if you check in on Yelp, you get one for free!

This is definitely a go-to breakfast spot if you live in the area. But, if you live elsewhere in the valley I am sure you can find a place that is just as good, if not better. I still like Black Bear Diner over Egg & I for breakfast.",4,0,2

 I ordered the chicken enchilada omelet and it was beyond delicious very flavorful and the tortilla chips on the top was the icing on the cake! Their hash browns are seasoned so well and you can tell everything was made to order. 
The only reason I did not give it 5 Stars was because it took a long time for us to get water and when we did they only brought one instead of 3 & we also did not have silverware.

I got the corn beef hash with two eggs over easy and their banana nut muffin. The corn beef was fresh and their banana nut muffin was really good! Now I see shy they were famous for them. The ranch potatoes were a little too salty for my taste. They need to tone it down on the salt and then they would be really good but really didn't eat them

My BF had the Chicken omelet and he gave me a bite and it was really de-lish especially if you are an avocado freak because there was a ton of avocado stuffed in the omelet.

They have these eggs that you turn over on the tables if you need service (see photo) which is a cool idea but our server was swamped and really was so far away with other tables that she couldn't take care of us well.

I came to Yelp like I normally do. Mostly everyone had something positive to say about this place, so my friend and I packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.

When we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. I sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that I could park. As soon as she walked in, she called me. She said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. Nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. So, I walked in to wait.

Upon entering, I was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. I just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. Surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.

The place is really small and packed to capacity, so I was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. We had plenty space.

The server came around fast to take our drink order. She was quick to bring our drinks back too. She asked us if we were ready to order and we said, ""No, we're looking at Yelp pictures and we need some more time."" I did ask about the stuff French Toast dish that someone shared on Yelp. She smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. Then she left and took orders for people that was around us.

As soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. When she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. We went ahead and ordered. It totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. The waitress said, ""You were on Yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?"" I was happy she reminded me to do that.

She came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. I don't even like banana nut muffins but I took it anyways because it was free. I took a bite of it and fell in love. It was so warm and yummy lol. My friend got emotional lol. She said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. They were just delicious.

About 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. I order the Stuffed French Toast with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. It also came with seasoned potatoes. It looked incredible. My friend ordered the 2 pork chops that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the seasoned potatoes. Her's looked delicious too.

I LOVE potatoes so I ate those first. I put ketchup all over them and had a ball. My friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. I put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.

Next, I started in on my French Toast sandwiches. I didn't like the sandwiches. The sausages, eggs and cheese didn't have much flavor. I thought I made a big mistake. Being that I'm so smart, I thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the French toast and season the filling myself. I did, and it was 90% better. I ate the filling separately, and ever so often, I would dip the French Toast in the warm syrup that came with my food.

My friend said that the pork chops were Just okay. They were really thin, for sure. I don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. I wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and I took a bite of hers. They tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. She was right. They were just okay. She did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.

The good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. I'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.

The service was like a 3\/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. I asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. I guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. I didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and I didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.

But also, I took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once I had actually finished it. It took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. We just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. When she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. She came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. We were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. I'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.

Although I'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, I probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average.",1,1,1

The salty diablo seasoning (not spicy) is amazing and the potatoes are always perfectly cooked.

The other breakfast foods are solid. I got the eggs Benedict and they drowned it in hollandaise sauce.

Any one with a Yelp account can also check in to receive a free banana nut muffin, which was huge, warm, and full of banana flavor. It was one of the best banana nut muffins I have tasted. In addition, coffee comes with unlimited refills! 

Our table ordered:
Bacon and sliced avocado omelette ($11.25): excellent. The omelette was huge and stuffed with ample chunks of whole avocado, bacon bits, and topped with a generous amount of melted Jack cheese and a dollop of sour cream. There was also a side of buttered toast and a choice of home fries, cottage cheese, or fruit (I think this is offered with any egg dish). Delicious, and a large portion size for one person. 
Heart stopper skillet special ($10.25): this was my favorite dish that our table ordered. It was one of the specials and consisted of a layer of works potatoes topped with bacon, ham, and sausage and smothered in homemade country style gravy and two sunny-side up eggs. The gravy and the runny egg yolks mixed with the potatoes and meat created a delicious creamy explosion of flavor and umami. 
Southwestern Cobb salad ($10.50): a huge salad with a ton of toppings. I was impressed that there was very little lettuce, and instead a lot of delicious toppings such as taco seasoned chicken, black bean and corn relish, tomatoes, black olives, bacon, cheddar cheese, tortilla strips, and a whole sliced avocado (amazing!) with chipotle ranch dressing. 
Sundance special omelette ($11.25): veggie omelette with spinach, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and Swiss cheese topped with tomatoes and feta cheese. You can also add chicken for an extra $2.50. The feta cheese melded perfectly with the creamy egg flavor and the various vegetables. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place for brunch. Service was super friendly and efficient, and the food is great value for the portion size and the price!",0,0,0

The bacon they use for omlettes is the same stuff Taco Bell does... shredded little bits that tastes like some kind of pork, just not bacon. Her friend's bacon strips were extremely overcooked, dark brown and crunchy vs. crispy. The homefries were terrible. Just potatoes with A LOT of some kind of cajun seasoning all over.

Ordered the works omelette and beef hash, with muffins and potatoes as sides. The banana muffins are simply amazing. I'm not a big fan of baked goods but the muffins are something else.

The menu consists of a variety of eggs benedict dishes, omelettes, hash, and other breakfast items.

Service is homey and the vibe is definitely casual here.  The menu comes out printed on newspaper stock so perhaps their items change frequently.

We started out with their signature banana nut muffin which accompanies many of their dishes.  Light, soft, fluffy, and not too sweet, the banana nut bread was a hit and a great starter.

Our entrees included a mish-mash of their popular dishes:

Prime Rib Benny (or Benedict) - the highlight dish entree was an Eggs Benedict version made up of prime rib.  It replaces the traditional muffin with a croissant and is definitely a large portion so was plenty to share.

Florentine Benedict - a version made with spinach and ham.  Pretty good.

Chicken Fried steak - I only had a few bites, but I liked it.  It's a calorie killer though.

Kay's Omelette - another signatuer omelette, it had plentiful cheese, ham, and egg.  Kinda plain and not sure why this is so popular.  You could make similar omelettes at home.

Brad's Chili - wasn't sure which chili to order and was recommended this one.  It came out lukewarm, had a bland flavor and was generally forgetabble. 

Eggs & I is a decent brunch spot, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.  They take credit cards, including American Express.",2,0,2

First, the staff is great, always warm & welcoming. Second, they have a system in place so you never have to wait longer than a couple seconds for anything (whether it's more water, ketchup, your order).

The food is really good!! I've never tried anything I didn't like here and they're consistently good! Their coffee is my absolute favorite coffee, it's rich and full of flavor. 

My favorite items:

- Their skillets are really good, esp. The bacon & onion one.

- Avocado bacon & cheese omlette

- Banana bread french toast

- Pancakes

Usually the service is pretty good and friendly except when they're super busy.  Then it gets a little quick and snappy.

Every time I'm here, while the service is great and friendly, the place is just packed and I find the breakfast to be lackluster, compared to Egg Works.

The seating is pretty crammed, even when you get there early. We're often bumped by servers and patrons as they're making their way to tables.

I also don't love how they *only* have those season-salty potatoes and not fresh hashbrowns. They have them, but only those frozen hashbrown patties. Meh. I like homestyle potatoes, but these really seem like they're dumped out of an Ore-Ida bag.

The last time we went, I asked for my poached eggs well in my eggs benedict and they came back *very* runny both times. I can handle a little runny, but these were like, runny to the point of being almost chilly inside the yolk.  It's a texture thing and it skeeves me. I know I'm not the only one. 

They were really great when I sent it back the first time, but the second time, I felt like a total pain in the ass and was embarrassed having to ask them to redo it, even though it wasn't my fault. They were gracious and took it off our bill and the 2nd time they made it, the eggs were cooked well enough. (Yes, we tipped on the full cost of the bill.) 

I also am not wild about how they completely drown their eggs benedict in hollandaise to the point you can't even see the bottom and the english muffin gets really soggy. 

My boyfriend's blueberry pancakes weren't that awesome either.  Kind of spongey and flavorless.

For the hype this location gets, it wouldn't be my first choice. But I know it's popular and beloved, so if someone else wanted to go, I'd go, but otherwise, I'd recommend one of their other locations.",2,0,1

All the reviews talk about their bannana nut muffin, but more on that later, first - the eggs...   I ordered the biscuits and gravy which comes with a side of 2 eggs (I chose scrambled) and a side of potatoes (the server allowed me to sub half of the potatoes for fresh fruit.

Everything on my large plate was done perfectly.  The eggs were warm, tasty, and not under or over done.  The biscuits were deliciously moist and puffy (best I've had in as long as i can remember) with a very nice sausage gravy.  The potatoes were original and had a nice texture but the seasoning was a bit much for my taste.  And the fresh fruit was very sweet and well, fresh!

As far as  the employees go, they all seemed happy, smiling, and they were genuinely nice.  There was no wait for me although I heard i just missed a rush.  everyone from the hostess to the servers to the cook did everything just right in my opinion.

Staci, our server, was an amazing server.  I watched her explain items to us, as well as others.  She was very attentive and personable.   The only issues I would have are these.  1) I wanted a pancake and they only have large portions and no option for a single normal pancake to add to the side of a large omlet.  2) the potatoes were very salty...tasty...but too salty.  I don't mind a bit odd salt or spuce...but these were over the top with salt.

Great place for a nice breakfast.

My BF got the eggs benedict that came with potatoes. The potatoes were like hollow skins with no meat inside and were salted beyond belief. I think we left swollen from all the water retention..

They also have rice plates, 3 choices, Hawaiin style. YUM!

DRINkS: Mimosa is not unlimited. But soft drinks and coffee are. Also if you order juice, they'd give you a carafe.

Took 2 hours for 2 mins of doc attention so we were pretty annoyed. This lifted our spirits, because we both love breakfast foods. We drove a few miles to go to Egg and I simply because I wanted to try it based on the great Yelp reviews.
We were not disappointed. Everything was great for my first time ever eating here.
We walked in at 1215 and were immediately seated on a Thursday lunch hour. There were plenty of tables inside and out, and since it was a sunny calm day we decided it'd be nice to get out and get a little sun after being stuck in the doc office.
I went with the ""This Little Piggy"" omelet and it was just the way I like it. Lots of egg, lots of cheese, and plenty of meats. It comes with chopped up bacon, chopped up sausage, and chopped up chunks of ham, folded in half and smothered with about a half pound of cheese!!!! Also comes with the country potatoes which I was expecting to be orgasmic based on reviews, but let me down just a little bit. Don't get me wrong they were really good, but maybe my batch just wasn't quite cooked long enough and they were a little softer than I like em. Also I got the banana nut muffin with my meal, (this thing WAS OUT-friggen-STANDING) and she brought it out before the meal, which I thought to be a little strange. But i was really hungry so it was just fine with me.
My honey got a breakfast burrito and she said it was really good, looked to me like it had a ton of peppers, which isn't my favorite thing in the world, but she enjoyed it. Had to take half of it home because she couldn't finish it all, this thing was pretty big and also came with the country potatoes.
This was a great breakfast experience and can understand how this place can get pretty busy at times. We were very happy with the food and mostly happy with the service, she was just a little slow a couple times and we were only there for about 45 minutes. i.e. forgot to get a sprite, and never really came back to ask us if we needed anything after our food was brought out and if it was cooked ok. After she brought the check we decided to get a refill to go since the sprite was $2.50 and brought late and we waited for a few minutes to see her but never did. In the end it worked out, when we paid we asked the cashier if she could help us in getting the to-go refill and she politely went and took care of that for us with a smile. :)

I ordered the mashed potato omelette. Seems to be a favorite. Easy to see why. The omelette itself was very tasty and flavorful. The potatoes were also delicious af. It also came with sour cream that made it even more delicious af. 
It deserves its own line. The banana nut muffin. It's amazing. Ditch the toast. Be brave and go for the muffin. 
My mom had the veggie crepe. It was also amazing. I have a big thing for avocados and there was plenty of avocado up in here. Highly recommended.

We decided to go off the strip for breakfast this past weekend to save some money. I swear we always spend at least $50 on breakfast when we eat in the hotels. Breakfast at Egg & I was under $30 :)

They were busy when we arrived and we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. They put us on the patio, luckily it wasn't too hot yet and there was one table left with shade. It was tolerable.

Service was decent but not over the top. They have a system where if you need something you flip over a plastic egg on the table and the waitress will come back. Seems like they never check on you unless you flip the egg.

Breakfast was good. I had the eggs benedict with bacon instead of canadian bacon. One of the bacon slices was too fatty and not cooked enough, but the other one was good. The hollandaise was tasty, although a little runny. The potatoes on the side had a nice flavor to them.

BF had their daily special, which was Cinnamon Roll French Toast. It was really good, had a custard batter. Too sweet for me, but he enjoyed it a lot. That was also served with a little cup of yummy cinnamon apples. I liked those very much.

You pay at the register, which is kind of annoying because that area is already super cramped with people waiting and there isn't really anywhere to stand in line to pay without getting in somebody's way.

...And I am obviously not the only one in town who feels the same way.

Its always nice to know that a place you love so much is appreciated by others, and thats the feeling you get as you pull into the Egg and I on Sahara. Immediately you will notice a group of people waiting patiently outside of the restaurant for the next available seat. When I go, being a smoker, I usually go out on the patio to enjoy the fresh air and a smoke with my coffee and book. The staff is so welcoming. I am a frequent visitor so they know where I would like to sit, escort me to a table of my choosing, provide an ashtray, and offer the heating lamp if it is cold outside. Always friendly, you are not just communicated with by your server, but others in the staff that notice your presence. Nobody walks around with blinders on. You feel as if they are there to enjoy your breakfast with you. 

Speaking of the breakfast; it is the best in town! The wait is never long, and the food is always fresh and hot. Makes one wonder what kind of army is stacked away in the kitchen. Spinning out plate after plate of unique dishes that dont only taste great, but are piled high on your plate, makes me want to walk into the kitchen and give its staff a huge hug. There is something on the menu for everyone's taste, and, unlike many chain breakfast places who will remain unnamed, you actually get fresh ingredients, and flavor without frou frou toppings of berries and whip cream to try and doll it up. I find myself looking at others plates and wondering what they are having with delicious anticipation of trying it the next time. My signature dish is Brads Special, and I almost never stray from a favorite, but the fact that I feel safe to do so at The Egg and I says a lot.

A pleasant ""hello how are you"" greets you at the door, and a friendly ""Thank you, have a nice day"" assures a future visit. If The Egg and I added a few floors atop its building, and offered rooms like a Bed and Breakfast, you better believe there would never be an available occupancy.",1,0,0

I had a banana nut muffin and the the egg crepe (the one with bacon and guacamole). Everything was spot on. The muffin was moist and flavorful. The crepe was a party of flavor, and the good salsa on the side was a surprising accompaniment for a breakfast place

Though the real star was the people. Service was what sort of thing you would watch in an instructional video. Everyone was nice.

We wanted the breakfast buffet at our hotel on the Strip, but found out that the price doubled on the weekend. So on our way out of town to the Grand Canyon, we did a quick Yelp search and found this gem. Being in Vegas, we thought it was funny that there were 777 reviews for this place, averaging 4.5 stars. It lived up to the hype! 

Definitely ask for the banana nut muffins, they are amazing. As are the potatoes. As are the omelettes...heck, it was ALL great! I ordered the chile relleno omelette (yes you read that right) and it was dee-lish. 

Our server, Alyssa, was friendly and made sure everything was to our liking and topped off. The manager, Gia, stopped by our table to check in on us and ended up giving us some great ideas of places to check out on our road trip.

After the crazy hustle and bustle and falseness of the Strip, it was great to eat at a down-home style diner. I liked it so much I wanted to buy a T-shirt, but they were out of the tie-dye one that I wanted. Which is probably the only non-five-star thing I can say about this place.

Drink some caffeine, ride with the windows down, stick your head out the window with your tongue in the wind.  Come ready to read & eat because you have a massive book of a menu to study before making a tasty decision, which you really can't go wrong.  Everything is very good, but very different with generous blends of ingredients.  Def not your normal boring breakfast foods.

So, if you're not awake and not ready to study the menu, use the random decision making method by closing your eyes before opening the menu to a any page and ordering the first item your finger lands upon.

You always have the choice of warm, fresh banana nut muffin or toast.  Let me repeat -- warm, fresh banana nut muffin, ahhhhh.  Just about everything on the menu is served with their yummilicious ranch style potatoes.

My favorite thing here is the Pesto Scramble (4 eggs scrambled with sliced chicken, pesto, tomatoes, spinach, and feta cheese.)  My other favorite is when they have the Country Potato Soup special, which is a creamy potato soup topped with lots of chives and some bacon.   It's not a regular menu item.

Yes, there is a wait.  But like everyone says, the line goes really quickly and I think we were seated within 15-20 minutes, which is not bad considering it was a Saturday at peak brunch time.

I ordered a corned beef hash with eggs and instead of their potatoes, I ordered rice.  The corned beef hash was okay, I like mine on the crispier side but it was still good.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  Not too many places can make the perfect over-medium where it's a little cooked but just enough runnyness to get some yolk without it spewing all over the plate like an over-easy.

Yes, it's all you can eat for $9.99, but how much can you really eat?  And how much do you want to eat every single morning?  Don't you want someone to bring you food instead of trying not to spill your bowl of oatmeal on a slow 80-year-old grandma in an ""I live to bingo"" sweater?

If you do, take a short drive down W. Sahara Ave to Egg and I.  You will not be disappointed.  Inconspicuously located in a nondescript strip mall, Egg and I provides a perfectly casual, hearty and homey breakfast without the pompousness and the hoopla of The Strip.

By now you're probably wondering what ""Egg"" looks like.  Well, Egg looks kind of like Humpty Dumpty, and ""I"" looks just like ""Egg.""  Just look on their website.  Might as well call the whole place ""2 Eggs,"" although it would probably detract from the restaurant's country kitchen charm.  

We came in around 9:30 am on Saturday morning, and the place was absolutely packed.  We got a table right away, but every party that came in after 9:45 had to wait a little.  We had just gotten into town, and I was glad they brought us a whole pot of coffee.  You'd better believe I took advantage of the proximity and the unlimited availability of good coffee.  Even the yellow cups with the company logo were cute enough to use at home.

We couldn't quite decide on what to order, and our waitress graciously waited, while offering valuable suggestions along the way.  The menu is extensive and the portions are huge, so....  Also, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so you don't want to make this decision lightly.

There was nothing light about my breakfast, however.  The Ultimate Skillet is not for the weak...that much I know.  A generous layer of breakfast potatoes had a Cajun flavor to it.  Paprika and something else gave those potatoes a light crunch and a reddish hue - pretty and delicious.  The Ultimate Skillet also featured mounds of sausage, ham and bacon, mixed in with bell peppers, onions and cheese.  The skillet wouldn't be complete with 2 scrambled eggs on top.  WOW.  

We also ordered one large pancake to share, but after getting through 3\/4 of the skillet, I wasn't hankering for a pancake.  I did try it, and it was fluffy and sweet, but it was just too much.  I was ready to throw in the towel, which almost never happens to me.  On any other day, I can finish any breakfast, and have some of yours, too, but the Ultimate Skillet proved to be a bit much.  Order at your own risk.  That's a LOT of food for $9.95.

Great breakfast in a quaint setting?  I will be sure to make it my regular Vegas breakfast destination.",4,5,4

I thought about this long and hard to make sure I am not exaggerating. The best meal I have ever eaten was the breakfast I ate on my trip to Las Vegas t at The Egg and I on West Sahara. This is a locals eatery.

I ate the standard, eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, and hash browns. On the menu it is called ""Eggs - Plus"". I added the sausage Ã  la carte. As I was eating, the taste of the meal brought a smile to my face.


 The eggs were very good. Not greasy or salty. Very tasty.

 The bacon was the best I ever had. Not too salty, not soggy, and not overcooked.

 The turkey sausage was the best I ever had. Not greasy or salty. Tasty.

 The hash browns were the best I have ever had. These were the square pieces of potato type of hash browns. Usually this type of hash browns is greasy, heavy, and dense. These were light, airy, and had some type of paprika seasoning.

 The toast was the best I ever had. Light and fluffy whole wheat bread. Not dense.

 The oj was great as well.

Blackened prime rib Benny - prime rib is diced small, mixed with veggies, served over a slice of sourdough with poached egg and hollandaise on top.  Their habla diablo potatoes are  pretty good. Crispy on the outside,  soft on the inside and dry seasoned with a reddish spice mixture that is slightly spicy. 

New York steak and eggs - this is an egg based restaurant that served cold, browned (aka overcooked)  scrambled eggs?! The steak was thin, cold,  and lacking any flavor. Their signature habla diablo potatoes were probably the only really good part of the dish. 

(I know that there is no built in firewall against poorly cooked eggs at an egg based restaurant but c'mon) 

Mimosas:
You're given a small, unopened bottle of champagne turned upside down in a glass Mason jar. A cup of pulpy orange juice is served on the on the side.  I like that you can control the ratio of champagne to orange juice. 

The atmosphere:
Farmhouse chic. Packed with patrons. There is an open air patio in the back (pets allowed). Booths in the middle, tables along the walls. 

The entryway deserves a paragraph to itself.
 One. Big. Clusterf**k. People are waiting to be seated and are either sitting along the walls or standing (most likely in the way of someone). People are lining up to be placed on the seating wait list. People are sitting or standing along the wall just inside the dining room and outside of the front door. People are ordering food to-go. People are lining up or grouping together like a human barricade, waiting to pay their bill. Honestly, even the hostess could not tell me where the line ended to pay the bill.

I saw Rachel Ray talk about the place on her Tasty Travels show and I thought I'd give it a try and get out of my ""usual"" Vegas routine.  But after going to three Rachel Ray recommended places (Vegas, LA, and Denver), I think I'm done trusting her judgment!

We went on a rainy, Saturday morning around 10:30 and had to wait maybe 15 minutes in a small waiting area which was crowded w\/ folks trying to avoid the cold rain.

When we were seated I already knew what we were going to order b\/c I had Yelped the place and read their menu online.  I ordered the Ultimate Skillet for the b\/f (he likes breakfast skillets), and the large Cashew Blueberry Pancake for myself.  

We had the ""famous"" banana nut muffin as our bread choice with the skillet, and let me just say, it was a regular ol' banana nut muffin.  I was gonna buy a whole loaf if it turned out to be good, but really, it was nothing to write home about.  Very average.

The b\/f noted that the skillet was made up mostly of their potatoes (another thing that ppl rave about).  I hardly got any of the other ingredients in there so I was disappointed in the skillet, too.

The pancake was alright.  It *WAS* big, as others have commented, but again, no big deal.  It was served with blueberry compote and I thought that helped b\/c it tasted sorta dry.  The b\/f thought some of the pancake was undercooked b\/c he could taste the batter.  Maybe I should've gone w\/ the silver dollar sized pancakes?

Also, I think cashews don't really work w\/ pancakes (unlike walnuts and macadamia nuts).

The ""large"" 12-oz glass of OJ was pretty small so the b\/f thought it was funny they would call it a ""large.""

Breakfast with tip was around $25 I think.  Not cheap for what you get.

No yoke we had the chile Relleno omelet  (a whole green chili stuffed with cheese inside your omelet covered with sauce and cheese) and the chorizo skillet eggs  , both were enough for two people each and both were tasty delish!

What I found was a nice coffee shop.  The service was very attentive, but the food was mediocre.  Maybe we missed the point, because neither my wife nor I wanted a breakfast consisting of ""hot sauce with something under it,"" which seems to be the specialty of the house.  So, for example, we both ordered ordinary hash browns instead of the potatoes ""diablo"" (or something like that).  The hash browns we got were clearly pre-frozen patties - not quite as good as the ones you get a Trader Joe's.  My stuffed french toast, and my wife's eggs benedict were very ordinary.  And the prices were at the higher end of the reasonable range.

I can't see any reason for us to go back to this place.  For now, our three favorite breakfasts on the West Side remain the Black Bear Diner, Hash House a Go Go, and the buffet at Orleans.",0,0,0

I ordered the Hobo scramble which was a special and not available on the regular menu. I am sucker for a scramble however the superior quality of the muffin has convinced me to sample the sweeter items (waffles) on the menu the next time I visit this place. Lots of people rave about the potatoes and I have to say that they were not what I personally am looking for in a potato. They are covered in seasoning and I just prefer a simpler potato flavor. The coffee was great and I cannot say that about many places! Here it is a good strength with a good flavor and it comes in cute mug with two happy eggs on it!

First off: check in offer is a banana nut muffin. When it came to the table it was warm and oh my god, so good.  It's gotta be made with some sort of whole wheat or bran flour cuz it's a dark looking muffin.  It's so moist (sorry, had to do it) and dense yet light, sweet but not too much, and just literally the perfect muffin.  

I asked our waitress, Karla, for some coffee and I was treated to my own thermos of it, score! There's a little egg symbol on the table that once it's switched to the other color it signifies that the table needs attending to. Jaime wanted an ice tea refill and flipped the egg over. Within seconds another waitress (Karla was busy) was at our table to help.  What a great team!

I ordered the Veggie Eggs Benny and was so pleased with it! It's two poached eggs on top of a split english muffin, with grilled tomatoes, avocado, and spinach.  The best though was dipping those seasoned potatoes into the hollandaise sauce. They're fried and perfect to dip into a yolk too.

As always, I turned to Yelp. I was craving Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs. my cousin wanted an Omelette and my Niece wanted pancakes or waffles. Yelp brought up several options and I read the reviews. The Egg and I had everything we wanted and the reviews were good. So, off we went. We got there pretty fast from the Strip about 15 mins. Upon our arrival the place was full. We were told it would be a 10-15 min wait but a table came up outside rather quickly. It was a hot day but we were starving and they had cooling mist sprayers which helped a bit. We were greeted by our waiter OSCAR who was friendly and hospitable. He took our drink order, mad some recommendations from the Specials and left us to figure out our orders. He delivered the drinks with these Bannana Nut muffins we didn't ask for. I didn't want the muffin but after I had a pinch I was hooked. Yes, it was warm and delicious. With the size of my breakfast I decided to save it for breakfast the next day. We placed our orders and no time after that we had our orders. The food looked and tasted great. The portions were large and pippin hot. We were all silently eating and enjoying our meal. 

Ok for the review. I am really specific about my chicken fried steak and I rarely get it because it usually sucks unless my mom or Southern grandma made it. But this one was quite good I must admit. My only complaint was with the potatoes. They were cooked well nice and crispy but was a bit salty. I prefer to add my own salt to taste because of that. My family agreed that their potatoes were also a bit salty. But overall our food was delicious and the service Great!!

Oscar is truly great at his job and we truly appreciated his service. We would gladly go to The Egg & I again without hesitation.

Oh....and the Bannana Nut muffin was AWESOME the next day with coffee :-)",1,0,0

We arrived and the line was out the door at 11:30am on a Saturday morning...granted it was St. Paddy's Day weekend, but I think it would have been just as long any other time.

We waited for a table for about 15 minutes. Not bad considering the line. Once seated, I checked into Egg & I, and I got a free Banana Nut Muffin. OMG!!!!!  THE BEST BANANA NUT MUFFIN EVER!  And that was just the beginning of our glorious dining experience.

Let's talk about Victoria. She's dynamite. You'll want her to be your bestie just as we all did.  She is so personable and friendly and funny and I could go on and on. She was so attentive, our glasses were never empty...even the Bloodies! She gave us her recommendations and we were NOT disappointed. 

Between us, we had omelettes, stuffed french toast, waffle w\/banana, coconut and toffee and a mexican skillet. As I said before, we were not disappointed. 

If this place came to California, we would definitely make the trek wherever it lands. I HIGHLY recommend Egg and I...and their BANANA NUT MUFFIN!

We had a great breakfast with banana-nut muffins, of course!  We were going to share a chile relleno omelet, and asked for an extra muffin, when the waitress told us that we could order half orders of just about anything on the menu - the cost was half of the menu price + 50 cents.  We did that instead, order half an omelette and half an order of grilled banana bread french toast. So I said - well, we won't need the other muffin, but the waitress said - no charge! - I'll bring you an extra anyway.

The food was excellent. The breakfast potatoes need some work - they were just hard fried ""bits"" of potatoes - but everything else was great.  A carafe of coffee was left on our table so that we didn't have to keep asking for refills, and cream\/flavored creamers are on the table to make a perfect cup of coffee.

Not sure if it was because we called in advanced.

This place is quite large on the inside with ample seating.
A family environment.

They have this thing on the table similar to what I saw at Bubba Gumps where you can turn the sign to make it so that if a waiter sees it, they will help you. See pics!

If you check in VIA Yelp - you get a free Banana Walnut Muffin - but I got one anyways with my meal.
I ordered the Sundance Special which was a veggie omelet with spinach, mushroom & artichoke hearts topped with tomatoes and feta cheese (which would lead to my later food poisoning - not through the fault of the restaurant but mine)
It was super yummy but it was a huge serving so I had to take it home.
FYI; leaving feta cheese in a car for 5 hours is never a good idea.

It was full of spice and flavor, you can definitely taste the banana. The corned beef hash was pretty good with the shredded style corned beef.

Yes there were people waiting outside to eat due to this place being so popular for breakfast.  The wait was 15 minutes which wasn't that bad.  I tried the waffle works, which consisted of a huge Belgian waffle with 2 pieces of bacon and 2 eggs.  I did request whipped cream on the waffle, which made it taste even better.

We got it off of the Triple D website and have had great experiences in the past so it seemed like a great choice. While it was not a terrible experience, it was certainly a disappointing one and here is why:

My mother and I both have a food allergy to Monosodium Glutamate more commonly known as MSG. It is a flavor enhancer\/ preservative often found in foods like Doritos, Cheetos, and all of those other junk foods you shouldn't be eating (but let's face it, sometimes we just need some junk food). For me, a little is OK, but my mother can't eat it at all. 

When we sat down at the table, we asked if they used MSG more out of habit than anything else; why would a breakfast spot need a preservative? Our waitress, who was very nice, informed us that it was in most of the food, but not the eggs. My mother, who had originally decided on the highly rated Chicken Fried Steak, had to change her order. Both of chose the Sunrise Mountain and decided to order fruit rather than take our chances with the Habla Diablo potatoes that came with 90% of the breakfast options.

When the food came out it looked delicious, but one bite changed our opinion. While it was plentiful, it was bland. Even the blanket of cheese over the top could not help it.

My father, who does not share my MSG allergy, ordered a skillet. Mom and I both took a bite of the Habla Diablo potatoes from his plate and they were delicious. Crunchy and flavorful, I would have loved to be able to eat them, but they were covered in stomach pain inducing MSG. And the only option besides the potatoes was fruit (which was very nice, but did nothing for the dish itself).

First, there is the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet.  Just so you know, the CFS has a crispy crust, cut into bite sized pieces and placed on top of their mini crispy potato cubes.  Topped with a good tasting, creamy gravy, this dish is really good.  I had to restrain myself from ripping it away from my son.

The Hanks Scramble contains fresh spinach, mushroom, tomato, and cheese.  I don't know where they went wrong, but I have had much better tasting vegetable scrambles.  It was a disappointment mainly because it tasted way to bland. Dumping their house salsa on it redeemed it considerably.

Then there were the pancakes and bacon. Decent pancakes, but nothing that stands out.  The bacon was salty but not smoky tasting and rather flaccid.  I like crisp.  Good, not great.

The Waffle and Bacon combo was similar, neither the waffle nor the bacon were crispy.

I really liked the serve yourself carafe of coffee left at our table. Got it hot.  Got it exactly when we needed it.

The service was excellent. Maybe part of that was because they did not need to run around filling coffee cups instead of taking care of more important matters like getting food out of the kitchen fast. Smart.

I used to get the steak and eggs before I turned Pesco-veggie, and it was gooood. My bf and I grabbed breakfast here a couple days ago and I just had two over easy eggs, wheat toast, and blueberry muffin. Muffin is always moist here and it's served warm so butter is a must. My bf got the steak n eggs with ranch potatoes and said he still loves it. Ranch potatoes are always flavorful here. I also suggest the tuna melt here--delicious. Service is good, we're so used to coming here so we don't mind the inconsistencies they have with their service. Although it would've been great if they wouldnt have alot of turnovers with their staff. It was great coming in here and the staff knew our names. But ever since the turnover we don't know anyone anymore except the host lady. Once again, food makes up for it so we shall be back regardless.",0,0,0

The omelet is simply the best I've ever had. It had the perfect combination of spinach, artichoke hearts, tomatoes and topped with feta cheese. Brilliant

Now, to the matter of the toast. Fortunately, one of my companions ordered the banana nut muffin. Even more fortunate, she offered to share. Not an over powering banana taste, more of a whole grain taste, yet just nutty enough, with a hint of chocolate bitterness. 

While I loved my experience, I can't give five stars, as some in my party were not as happy with their dishes as I was with mine. I do look forward to trying more from the menu very soon.",2,0,1

I figured out the LAS is not the cheap place for anything anymore.  Other half had the waffle - which was one of those big, thick, crusty ones- about 1 inch high.  Most places sell the wimpy 3\/8th inch high waffle.  Killer home fries with some kind of chili\/onion powder that came w\/ my two eggs.  I felt our waitress was a little pushy, but she was just doin' her job.  All I wanted was the two eggs that came with potatoes.  She kept asking if I wanted sausage, or bacon.   Choice of English muffin or the 'to die for' banana nut muffin.  Too bad there's no place like this on the strip.  If there was, lines would be 10miles long. Keep in mind, ya need a car to get to this place.  I don't know about public transportation in this area.",0,0,0

Call ahead of time, to see how long the wait is. They usually seat people fast, but because it is SO good, you should definitely expect to wait. 

I'm so glad I took a group of 10 of my girlfriends here at the end of our Vegas trip. The portions were humungous and I had to challenge myself to finish my plate. Yes, the banana nut muffins do live up to its hype!! So delicious and so fresh. Most plates actually come with the banana nut muffin as an option, but they'll give you another one if you check in!

Their menu is EXTENSIVE. So if you are an indecisive person like I am, it'd probably help kill your wait time if you take a look at that menu to decide what you want! They offer breakfast sandwiches, french toast, egg bennys, OMELETTES, specialties, and more. I went for the chile relleno omelette and I'm SO glad I did! It wasn't too saucy and the sauce they offer is super good. Their POTATOES. SO GOOD. Thank god they let me get half potatoes half fruit, because the full portion of potatoes is HUGE! 

My girlfriends and I all ordered different items on everyone enjoyed their meal :) I would say you probably can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Definitely coming again to end a Vegas trip. 

Service is great. The interior decor is super cute. Very family friendly!

I spent $15 including tip for a HUGE breakfast so, yes, I'd say this is a very good breakfast deal located off the strip!",2,1,1

It's about a 10 minute drive from main casinos, located in strip mall. Popular dining spot for locals and gets packed on weekends. Luckily, we arrived early before the breakfast rush and were seated immediately. Good thing too, 20 minutes after a bus load of people arrived and place was full.

Country style atmosphere and dÃ©cor provide the perfect backdrop for their food. Both indoor and outdoor patio seating is available. Old-fashioned breakfasts are the specialty here, including huge omelet platters, pancakes, eggs benedict and a large selection of house specialties. Prices are reasonable and large portions. I highly recommend trying their famous banana nut muffin. OMG, so good! Super moist and the flavor profile is off the charts. I got mine free with my Yelp check-in. You can also substitute the toast that comes with your breakfast entrÃ©es for a muffin. 

We ordered ""The Works"" scramble, Fresh Veggie omelet and the Hawaiian breakfast spam and eggs. Everything was fantastic! Served in large skillet, the scramble was yummy. It's loaded with sausage, ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers and mushrooms, served with hash browns and topped with the fluffiest scramble eggs. Enough for 2, I literally devoured everything and no regrets. I loved the taste and texture of the hash browns, lightly crisp and tender. I usually prefer shredded kind, but this was equally nice. Of course, who doesn't love spam and eggs for breakfast? Simple Hawaiian-Pinoy breakfast done well here, served with steam rice. Just the way us locals love them.

Most of the time we usually dine along the strip because it's convenient. Egg and I was definitely worth the drive and waking up early for. Service was excellent too. Our server did a phenomenal job, friendly and refilled our coffee regularly. Still thinking about those banana nut muffin. Looking forward to coming back.",5,4,6

The wait staff was outstanding (ask for Sam if she's there), the service was prompt, the portions were plentiful, the price was appropriate for the size of the portions and the food was absolutely phenomenal. Get the banana nut muffin whether it's included or not. It was so good, it tasted like a dessert. To add butter or anything else to it would be a crime, it was perfect the way it was. My wife had waffles with strawberries and whipped cream. Typically, she does not eat large portion meals without sliding some of it across the table to me. She polished off the whole thing. I had some kind of special that came with four scrambled eggs mixed with bacon, spinach, mushrooms and loads of cheese and some kind of side of potatoes that was eye-rolling awesome. I've been on this planet for over half a century and I honestly don't remember the last time I had a breakfast that tasted this good from start to finish.

Now that she has been homogenized and Oprah-sized and puts on make-up like Jack Nicholson as the Joker, I am somewhat sympathetic to her insatiable need to be the people's home cook, the pint-sized Paula Deen. Maybe that's why I was rather turned off by one of her Tasty Travels recommendations, the Egg & I on the corner of a strip mall out on Sahara Drive in Vegas. 

Even though it doesn't have the A-frame roof, it's really an IHOP with a country kitchen vibe that seems to draw the who's who of the Convoy-and-trailer-park set. Rachael was giving her thumbs up to this place for all the egg dishes they offer. That I won't argue as the menu went on with variations of omelettes and skillet breakfasts that span the globe and stretch the pocketbook. Jamie W. was being very good and ordered the Original Breakfast Burrito (see photo). However, it was quite a log that came out with a flour tortilla stuffed with four eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers onions, potatoes, cheddar and jack cheese. It came on top of a plate of cubed ranch potatoes and some salsa. 

It honestly tasted like any breakfast burrito, just more of it to justify the entree-level price. I went all self-indulgent and ordered the Blackened Prime Rib Benny, an Eggs Benedict variation which had little cubes of prime rib (whether it was blackened or even prime rib was quite arguable), sauteed spinach, roasted red bell peppers all chopped over what looked like a slice of Texas toast. Two poached eggs lay on top, and I asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side (see photo). Thank goodness since it was the congealed variety that clogs arteries faster than Drano cleans them out. It was on the meh side with nothing hofbrau-ish about the meat at all.

The dish came with the same cubed, packaged-looking potatoes Jamie got, and neither of us had any desire to finish them out. When you order coffee here, you actually get a little pot so they can charge $2.25 for it. Jamie had a glass of milk but it was $2 for just six ounces. Hell, I would have lactated myself for that price. Service was efficient, and even though they have a little egg sign you can flip over to get a waitress' attention, there was no need for it since they seemed interested in turning over tables lightning fast. I'm afraid I will need to second-guess Rachael Ray's judgments on what amounts to good eats on her travels, or else I may be doomed to high-calorie intakes of mediocrity. 

FOOD - 2.5 stars....just thought the dishes were just too generic despite the abundance...it didn't seem human hands touched those ranch potatoes 
AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...country kitchen quaint if that's your idea of charming 
SERVICE - 2.5 stars...efficient if rather impersonal, no need to flip that egg sign over on a busy morning

Came on Monday, June 9th for breakfast and from the time we walked in to the time we walked out we had exceptional customer service by Gia the manager and our waitress, Carole Ann.   They were both very personable.

We we're seated promptly in the back next to the kitchen by Gia.  Carole Ann came by to acknowledge us but would be right back because she had to sing happy birthday at a table.  No biggie as we were on vacation and wasn't in a rush to go anywhere.  

Gia came by and apologized but no need to apologize for the delay.  She came out with two banana muffins for us while we waited and took our drink orders and came out with it.  Those muffins were delicious.  Carole Ann came back and took our order.  I ordered the spam and egg over rice.  That came with a muffin or toast and since we already got the muffin I thought that was it.  But she offered me toast or another muffin to take home, but I declined.   My other half ordered a chorizo skillet.  

The food and service was great and I would have def gone back but my intentions while I was in Vegas was to visit a different restaurant everyday.

-Ordered a skillet and it didn't really have the ""bacon and onion"" in it ... it was all potatos and eggs.

During the weekends, the wait is up to 30 minutes. The staff is super friendly, they are great at keeping your coffee cup full. Also, what's cool is that when you have an issue or need something they have an egg on the table, you can flip it to reveal a sad, yellow egg. Someone is usually at your table within 30 seconds.

Service: 5\/5
------------------
The service was good. There was only one bad service experience. One of the hosts that was taking our phone number and name to seat us when ready was very rude. She looked very unhappy, and spoke rudely with very few words: ""Phone number....Name....Number of people."" We gave her the information and she just turned away. Some what rude. After being seated, our server was very polite and kind, an opposite from the host. It being our first visit we asked for recommendations, and he gave us a number of recommendations, from the stuffed french toast to the chili relleno omelette. Because it was our first time, he brought us free banana nut muffins on the house, as a welcome to The Egg and I! First time a restaurant has done that. 

Food: 5\/5
-------------------
We ordered the stuffed french toast, traditional eggs benedict, and chili relleno omelette. 

Stuffed French Toast: 4\/5
Scrambled eggs, cheese, and sausage sandwiched between 2 pieces of french toast. Was good but not amazing. I found it to be dry, but I'd honestly get it again. 

Eggs Benedict: 5\/5
The eggs were perfect, and english muffin perfect texture. However, a bit heavy with the hollandaise sauce. Overall, probably my favorite entree. 

Chili Relleno Omelette: 4\/5
Cooked perfectly, with lots of flavor. Unique dish with the chilis inside the omelette. Didn't get to try much of it

Habla Diablo Potatoes: 5\/5
Probably some of the best potatoes I've ever had. Cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I'd almost compare the texture to McDonalds french fries. They're seasoned with spices and we're very very good!

Banana Nut Muffins: 5\/5
Best banana nut muffins I've ever had! Not too sweet and very moist. One of my favorite items we got.

3) Ranch potatoes were FANTASTIC. They were seasoned perfectly and not overly salty. They didn't have that heavy, thick potato texture. It was lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

First off, the location is really crappy looking.It almost made me want to find something near the hotel we were staying at. Second,  the food is not that great. It's just big slabs of cheese basically on the omelettes, and there was no flavor. Where's the flavor?! I had a bacon and avocado omelete. It had little bacon bits cooked into the egg, and it was hardly noticeable. The avocado was in a big chunk in the middle. Then it was covered in cheese and had some sour cream on top. Maybe strips of bacon would be better. Then maybe it could be tasted. 
the potatoes are way too salty and taste weird. they definitely seemed like they were frozen. My husband was not impressed with his omelete neither.

Monday comes along and I'm back in the office and I read that a car plows into this restaurant. WTF? I hope everyone who was injured in this moronic act a speedy recovery. I also hope they are able to be fully operational again ASAP (if not already). 

Egg & I is located minutes from the strip on Sahara. I believe their other restaurant goes by the name of Egg Works. This restaurant is open everyday but only between the hours of 6am-3pm. We got plastered the night before and somehow were able to wake up and drive our zombie behinds to eat here the next day right before noon. The wait wasn't too bad considering the restaurant isn't too big to begin with. 

Our server Jacky was a sweet heart. She was uber friendly and attentive even when it seemed like the restaurant was chaotic. How many other tables did she have with a bunch of hung over dudes, possibly acting a fool beats the hell out of me. She was holding it down like a seasoned veteran. She started us off with that infamous banana nut muffin. This is not to be missed especially with a cup of joe.

Not going to lie and say that this place serves health conscious types of food. They may have some ""lighter"" dishes but the menu is dominated by heavy hitters. Everything we ordered was either smothered with country gravy or had some sort of heavy but tasty sauce. We thought of this great game plan to all order our own entrees and add an extra French toast plate to share amongst the five of us. Bad, bad decision. One entrÃ©e is an adequate amount of grub. Anymore, you may want to check your blood pressure.

There are plenty of choices on their menu and as you can imagine, numerous egg inspired dishes. From skillets to classics, you'll find something for everyone. I had the Country Benny, you can look it up yourself. Let's just the menu states, ""This one's a heart stopper."" Need I say more? That dish was good but I also hated life afterwards. No regrets, it was delish while I was conquering that beast but just be ready for the consequences.

Arrival wait pretty much sucked, did not help that the hostess was on the rude side.

Lo and behold our waitress (Paula) came through to save the day in the service department. She was great from the get go and stayed consistent providing excellent comfortable service that you'd want to get from a breakfast spot after a looooong night out.

Food:

The Check-In Muffin: Meh, nothing great. I'm a big carrot raisin muffin person and this was okay. Complimentary so am I allowed to give it a 2\/5? 

The Big Omelette: If it's not called that then it's some synonym of the word big. How impressive can an omelette be? Order this and you'll find out. The way that the ingredients are actually layered in between the eggs is a unique alternative to the usual blanket style omelette. Ingredients a plus. 4.75\/5

Potatoes: These need a review of their own. Eggs and I let me know I was not crazy for expecting good side breakfast potatoes everywhere else where I've had them. The seasoning extraordinary...cooked to perfection..add a little catsup and you've got the best potatoes I have ever had at breakfast. 5\/5

French Toast: I got hit with an avalanche off the high that I was on. There was something wrong with these. Not so the taste but more of the texture. Even the berries and the whip could not save these. 2\/5

Orange Juice Carafe: It seems bottomless for two, good deal, good taste. Freshly squeezed I think. 4\/5

Not disappointed with my meal here. The hostess and the french toast need to be reworked a little, get her to shadow Paula and steal Blu Jam's recipe, maybe?

(Learned that from my first trip there.) Order two orders of skillet potatoes (one for me and one for Adam.) They are literally that good. Each bite is a perfectly seasoned little bite of french fry \/ hash brown combination. Fruit platter with your choice of three berries. Lots of orange juice because I'm a sucker for pulp and vitamin c to start out my day. 

After 5 times here I've realized, it's really great for what it is. A alternative for some Denny's or Ihop because I'd rather support a local business owner. This place has breakfast down and I plan on eating here whenever I'm craving those skillet potatoes. Chya Boy!",0,0,0

*Reuben Sandwich w\/ Fries: The meat was perfectly seasoned between two toasted slices of bread. mmMmmm... Oh and they gave an extremely generous offering of french fries. yum yum! 
*Fender Blender: Some type of egg and crepe contraction which was light fluffy and all around delicious. It came with an asian-inspired sauce which complimented the main course perfectly. Oh and the potatoes were spot-on!   
*Florentine Omlette (Daily Special): Ironically the daily special was not special at all . Instead it was a complete epic fail in my party.  Way too cheesy as the produce was drowning in the gooey sea.

Pretty busy for a Monday morning. Were seated within 2 minutes, great. Server was friendly and attentive. Wife had the strawberry cream cheese stuffed french toast...yummy. Very good with a nice sized portion. 
I had the corned beef hash. Good stuff, also a nice sized portion. I love corned beef hash and this was homemade. Excellent. Hit the spot. Great food, good service, reasonable prices.
I was not too fond of the location ( I felt it was a bit far) but I wanted to avoid the strip so I guess I shouldn't complain. 
The only CON for me was the lack of info on the server's part. I love pancakes, and always have them for breakfast when I dine out. I asked for pancakes instead of toast and was told they could not do that. Okay, no biggie. Not the first place that does this. However, the pancakes were HUGE and 3 came with the order. I barely even touched them because I was almost full from the hash. I was pretty upset that I dropped $6.25 for an order of pancakes that I had less than 1\/4 of because of the shear size. I feel the server could've let me know they were huge and given me an option. Service is a big part of the experience when dining out. If I wouldn't have dropped $6.25 on uneaten pancakes our server would've gotten a nicer tip.",0,0,0

My husband of course was a bit hesitant to venture off the strip, but he was SO happy I found Egg and I. (We ate here every morning of our 3 day stay). It was seriously that good.

We ordered-
breakfast burrito (ordered with egg whites and light cheese) A+
chicken fried steak: A (better to get sauce on side IMO)
chicken omelet (it had a ""special"" name to it) A+
Denver omelet (ordered with egg whites and light cheese) A+
whole wheat pancakes (HUGE ORDER!) A+
Portions are big, so don't order too much!

Service was great! We had the same server all 3 days. She was surprised to see us back on the 2nd day, but was just laughing when she saw us the 3rd day. A bit funny I know :) She made sure our visit was pleasant, asking if we needing anything. The only thing I needed was help walking out their door, since I ate so much.

Today, I went with the Crazy Chicken Omlet (""you're crazy for not trying it""). It's a plateful - so much so that we got a box to enjoy it later.

friends wanted to try this for lunch when we were in the area and i had high hopes for this place. wait for a little over 10 people was a long wait as this place is super busy. once we got seated we noticed the place was packed and our service ended up being horrible. i guess they utilize these egg signs on the tables to indicate if we need help or not and look. we were the unhappy eggs of the place. sat down and ran out of menus. we waited for over 10 minutes then got menus. after we all decided what we wanted to order it took another 10 minutes to get someone to help take our order. the guy who took our order kept hitting my friend's chair as he took his order over 20 times. after we ordered our food took an okay amount of time to come out. once it came out no one could eat because they ran out of utensils and he had to ask wishing a 15 minute period three different waiters to get us utensils (how long could this possibly take?) then we ate our food. EVERYTHING WAS SO SALTY.

i had the burger and fries (i know who gets a burger here but its what i wanted and when you have such a large selection it truly suffered). my burger came WITHOUT onions. i was confused had to ask the waiter if they give onions and he was like they should. patty was cooked with no seasoning at all. bland. tomatoes were frozen. nothing special on it like damn i know its a plain burger but its so bad... NEVER GET THE BURGER. fries were the most salty thing I've ever tasted in my life. like wow. I'm a person who licks my plate clean and i didn't finish this plate at all. biggest waste of my money. i tried my other friends dishes and we all agreed all the dishes were salty. not acceptable.

Between the 4 of us that tried Egg & I, we each got different dishes and were all very happy with the food. The portion size is huge as well. If you're not that hungry, share with someone. The omelettes are made with not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 eggs. FOUR EGGS. It's a beast omelette among eggs.

Three things I will highlight: The eggs benedict, the banana nut muffin, and potatoes.
--Eggs Benedict: Order this and you will not be disappointed. The hollandaise sauce that's drizzled over the eggs is something that most places mess up, but at Egg & I, it's made to perfection -- smooth, creamy and seasoned just right.
--Banana Nut Muffin: They give this to you when you order and omelette, and don't miss out. It's the most airy, soft, moist -- yes, moist -- muffin you'll ever eat. It's like they fold air into the batter before baking. THAT GOOD.
--Potatoes: MY GOD. These are the best side of potatoes I've ever had. I'm convinced they have to be fried, but I'm not sure. The exterior is exquisitely golden crispy with a perfect seasoning blend on the outside. Best potatoes west of the Mississippi; hands down.

that's what I felt when I put the stuffed french toast in my mouth! and this is what I looked like O.O

I came here once before and got a healthy omelette. I wasn't thoroughly impressed with this place, but let's be real, how yummy can anything healthy get? But I decided to give it another chance and decided to try one of their signature dishes. THE stuffed french toast: french toast stuffed with egg, sausage and cheese topped with powdered sugar. It's a heavenly mix of savory and sweet, especially dipped in maple syrup.

Most of their entrees come with their homemade potatoes. They're lightly fried to give a french fry crisp and cajun-flavored that makes it taste like Lay's BBQ chips!!

We had to get the bus as we were staying on the strip but it was well worth the journey! This place is amazing! 

My wife had the breakfast burrito and I had the corned beef hash with poached egg. My wife devoured his and said it was fantastic, mine was so good that I can't find the words. 

I was expecting the sort of corned beef you get in a tin, I was soooooo wrong! This was real pulled beef! My eggs were perfectly poached and I cleared my plate which is rare!

Our server was a real asset to the restaurant, so good at his job. When my wife told him how we had found out about the restaurant he brought us complimentary muffins which were mouthwatering. 

We had a massive jug of coffee that was just perfect! I can't recommend this place highly enough, the food, service and value for money are spot on!

Anyways, enough of the muff fin because the food was good and service excellent. I ordered the stuffed french toast which included scramble eggs & ham stuffed between 2 thick toast.

My friend ordered the chicken fried steak skillet. I tasted some of it and it was delicious. The gravy that came with it was just really tasty. I was hearty and I would order it next time...=) 

The service was great with a egg-sign on the table if you wanted a server to come by if you needed anything. You flip it and any of the server who sees it will come to you. NICE!

I had the chicken fried steak skillet.  The dish consisted of eggs over medium over a layer of sliced chicken fried steak on top of a layer of potatoes all smothered with a coat of gravy. 

I love greasy and unhealthy foods in general but I am starting to think that my taste buds are slowly changing.  The meat was dry and salty.  I had to continually dip the chicken in the gravy to get some moisture and to mask the salt away.  The potatoes were even worse.  They were doused with a heavy coat of seasoning salt.   I considered wiping each piece of potato with my napkin so that they would be edible.

I drank a lot of water that day.

I do want to mention, however, that service was nice and my wife enjoyed her huevos rancheros.

When I go on trips that involve Vegas, I've started planning the itinerary to let me go to Eggs & I for breakfast. It is a slight trek from the strip, but totally worth it.

For my most recent visit I got the Ensenada Burrito and my wife got the Banana Bread French Toast. The Ensenada Burrito was a recommendation from my server Amanda and I'm so glad I listened to her. The burrito was delicious. Tasty meat and eggs in the burrito and topped with a healthy amount of cheese. Plus, it came with a side of their potatoes (what they call habla diablo seasoned potatoes) which are some of my favorite breakfast potatoes. So good. My wife's french toast was sweet and delicious. The service was top notch. Amanda (our server) was cheerful and seemed genuinely excited to help us figure out what to eat.

Oh, and they have this black\/yellow egg heads on each table to notify the staff if you need help (Black smiley face = you're ok, Yellow frowny face = need assistant). The staff watches this like hawks. Each time we flipped it, a staff member (not just your server) is right there to help. We were in a rush and needed the check... flipped it... 5 seconds later a staff member was there... 30 seconds later our server gave us our check. It was awesome.

So when a friend recommended trying this place, I was down to give it a try.  I had high expectations and I wasn't disappointed!  I like how they give you a carafe of coffee when you order a cup (like IHOP) so you don't have to constantly wait to get refilled.  Since I usually drink 3-5 cups every morning, this was a plus.

As far as the food, it also met my expectations.  I decided to try the egg-ceptional omelet (has bacon, mushrooms, ham, peppers, onions and sour cream) and not only was it delicious, it was more than enough food to last me through lunch.  I wanted to try the pancakes as well but I couldn't get it as a side so i tried the banana nut muffin that other reviewers had recommended - it was good but not great, but I'm not a big fan of banana nut in the first place so others may enjoy it, i don't know.

I don't think we ever used it, but I had looked it up on Yelp last year, and remembered it had good reviews.

Fast forward to yesterday, 4\/2\/11. While eating a breakfast of homemade blueberry waffles and chillin on the patio, Lawrence T. was telling me all about how much he loved breakfast foods - all kinds. I was trying to figure out where we were would eat before we headed off to The Adventure Dome later during the day (we ended up not going.) I was bummed when he said breakfast foods were where his heart was, because it's my least favorite meal of the day. 

Around 2 PM, after driving around and me not remembering the names or addresses of the places that I wanted to try on the west side (where he lives) I spotted ""Egg & I."" Despite the fact I'm not into breakfast, I decided to suck it up and offer this place as an option because Lawrence had told me he liked breakfast so much. It helped that I vaguely remembered that it had good reviews here on Yelp. 

Upon walking in, you get hit in the face with the ""breakfast"" restaurant smell. You know what I'm talking about. We were seated immediately and took it all in. Lawrence was all into the fact they had soccer on their tv and that they had a zillion choices on their menu. Despite the extensive choices, not too long after sitting down, we ordered. I got the tortilla soup and house salad with ranch, and Lawrence got some omelet and fruit... and was mistakenly given a humongous side of the most delicious skinny fries ever (the problem was quickly remedied by a pregnant lady who worked there bringing him the fruit he actually ordered.) 

The tortilla soup, while not the type I'm used to was SO good, I could not stop eating it. The house salad rocked, especially with the sprouts on top, and the ranch dressing was on par with that of The Mad Onion (aka DELICIOUS!) I didn't try any of Lawrence's fruit or omelet, but the few fries I stole off of his plate were the best fries I'd ever tasted. Yeah, they're that good. 

I have to agree with Bonnie G.'s statement that, ""You know the food is good when you are so full and you keep eating.""  Lawrence kept eating his fries, while saying he should stop because he was tired of fried foods... but they were too tempting, even when blanketed by napkins on top to hide them from view, hehe.  I was so full toward the end of the meal, but my salad was so good, it was hard to finally push the remainder away.  

For our meals + coffee + $5 tip, it came out to $27 and some change. We both confided over our meal that we weren't sure about how good this place would be when we pulled up to the place, but after trying the food, it was super bomb.",4,0,2

My Buddy recommended The Egg & I after hearing some good things about it from other sources. I've driven by this place multiple times and it's caught my attention a few time while in the same plaza as B&C Camera. 

They have a diverse menu of egg related items. I was about to order one of the combo skillets because another table's home fries looked GOOD but ended up getting a Hawaiian themed plate which featured Portuguese Sasuage or Spam (went for the sausage), rice, two eggs any style (sunny side up), ""sticky"" rice (turned out to be calrose rice). Also came with a choice of what ever bread or the banana nut muffin everyone raves about. 

I choose the muffin and man oh man it did not disappoint. Blueberry's always been my favorite muffin and to be honest i havent eaten enough muffins in my life time. If i were in a situation where the entire fate of humanity rested upon my recommendation for a muffin it would be The Egg & I's banana nut hands own, sorry humanity you had your chance i'm throwing this one out and if it lands under the bus so be it. 

Overall the island favorite plate was good, obviously the Portuguese sausage made the dish but in all honesty it wasnt worth the price. Even with the banana nut muffin dreams are made of it still wasnt quite worth it. For the same price my buddy got one of the combo skillets and he ended up easily with three times more food then i did.

So far i do like this place. Outdoor seating was available immediately seeing as it was a cold morning but their heaters are very powerful and aside from a few gusts of wind there was very little outdoor discomfort. Looking at other people's plate was very easy on the eyes as their selection of food is diverse yet seeing common dishes amongst different diners makes me want to come back and get what they're getting because they cant all be wrong.",4,1,3

My chicken fried steak was too salty and the country gravy itself was too salty too. I felt that I got overdosed with the salt after I've finished only one third of the chicken fried steak. I had my egg scrambled, and the egg didn't taste good, seems like they put white pepper in it and I don't like white pepper. So I was done with the egg with only one bite.

My husband said the egg crepe was interesting enough that he liked it, while it was also too heavy for him as it's made with 4 eggs.

The meal was okay, could be better though. We can get better chicken fried steak (with the right saltiness) at the other diner in town, so probably won't order chicken fried steak ever again at Egg & I. 

I think the best item of the meal was the banana nut muffin, which was only a side that came with the entree.

At first, the order for the eggs benedict came out wrong with canadian bacon and spinach vs. just all veggie. The waitress brought out extra banana nut muffins to apologize, which was a nice gesture especially since the best thing here was the banana nut muffin.  The hollandaise on the benedict was really watery and had a slight sweet taste to it. Overall, the benedict lacked flavor. On the other hand, the hash and the breakfast potatoes were extremely salty.

I had a benedict. I asked for the eggs medium hard, and they came out essentially hardboiled (I am not holding that against them), but worse, the hollandaise was pretty awful. Sort of an off, slightly grainy texture, no lemon to cut the richness, just unappetizing. Potatoes seemed too regular, like processed frozen potatoes. 

On the upside, I tried one of the banana nut muffins, and it was pretty good. The staff was wonderful--really nice, helpful, on point.

One of the most innovative breakfast menu's I've seen and particularly impressive is the ability to execute so many offerings to perfection.  Service was outstanding, our waitress, Jessica, was fast and efficient.  

The feature here is undoubtedly their banana nut muffins.  They were excellent, rivaling the best homemade I've ever tasted.  What amazed me is how they can produce as many as they have to do to supply this very busy and fairly large restaurant.   They were warm and obviously very fresh and tasted as good as most any homemade.  They have a slight gingerbread taste to them so I suspect molasses is a part of the recipe.   I know how much work they are to make homemade which is why I really admire their dedication to featuring this treat.    The food was really good as well, because they wouldn't earn any points from my son who doesn't eat anything with bananas in it.  I feel my opinion was well founded and based on a total of three banana muffins- mine, my son's, and a free one as a YELP check-in bonus.  I carried two out and enjoyed them later in the day.

I had the three little pigs omelet which was great.  The potatoes were done to perfection- crisp on the outside, evenly done throughout with a nice seasoning on the outside.  My son had a western omelet with tomatoes substituted for the potatoes.  A nice patio is outside with misters to help battle the Vegas temps and low humidity.

It's no question this is a premier spot to enjoy a wonderful breakfast in Las Vegas with just a little drive from the downtown strip.",1,0,0

Experience:  I met some friends for early lunch or late breakfast.  It was pretty busy for 11:00 on a Thursday.  

Facility:  fairly good size place with a dinner atmosphere. There were murals on the walls,  and typical tables and chairs with some half booth seating too. 

Service:  not the best service I ever had, but not the worst. Doesn't seem to be one set waitress per table...this can be a good or bad thing. It took a good 10 minutes before someone took my drink order, we had to flag someone a few times, and after the food came, no one did the check back to make sure we didn't need anything else....but when they did help us, they were friendly and quick. 

Food:  a girlfriend and I decided to split two meals, so we could try more.  We ordered the ""Chili Relleno Eggs Benedict"" special, and we got the ""chicken fried steak with over easy eggs and banana nut muffin.""  
The muffin came out warm and it was pretty tasty.  Would have been perfect if they served some butter with it. 
The Benedict was good. I love the chili taste that cut the richness of the Benedict. 
The chicken fried steak was good, but not the best I ever had. It was crispy outside and a nice southern white gravy on the side to dip it in. I really did enjoy the hash brown potatoes on the side.  When they first came out, I thought I wouldn't like them because they looked to have too much seasoning on them.  However, they actually had just the right amount, and it had a Lawrys season salt flavor. 

Overall:  I would definitely come back here again. They have so many good things in the menu I want to try.  See yah soon!!",0,0,0

Considering the overbearing amount of 5 star reviews this place has, I'm not sure why my experience was so disappointing in comparison. 

We ordered the banana nut muffin (free with a check in), the Classic, and the Works skillet. Two tables that were seated after us received their food before we did. We ended up waiting a really long time just for two entrees. But we brushed it off considering there could be many factors at play.

The Classic had three slices of bacon that resembled rubber. They were not crispy at all. I didn't like the seasoning of Hablo Diablo potatoes as I felt the seasoning was overbearingly strong. I felt like there was hardly any meat and a WHOLE lot of potatoes. 

We drank all our water and tried to get our waitress's attention. After five minutes or so, I flipped the egg to yellow (meaning we would like attention). Our waitress glanced at our table and proceeded to walk away. Another waitress promptly flipped it back to black and asked what we needed. When I said we needed a refill she said okay and proceeded to chat with the table next to us. She never bothered to grab our waters. Finally, our waitress asked what it was that we needed earlier and finally got us water. 

Also guess what? Never got the banana nut muffin.

The wait was manageable as we arrived in between the early morning rush and weekend late breakfast crowd.  We can tell why it is a local favorite as it the staff offers a warm welcome.

Their famous banana muffin arrived almost immediately after we put in the order.  It was so light, fuffy, yet sticky, we could have easily eaten a full loaf just the two of us.  We didnt realize you can order the full lf until a plate was served near us... 

Their menu (made to look like the morning paper - clever concept!) offered an abundant options that it could be overwhelming.

They dropped our veggie eggs benedict, so they had to fire it again... the spinach was left raw and piled in top of the itty bitty english muffin and slivers of avocados.  We love spinach, but the proportions were off - would have liked a slightly sauteed spinach or place a smaller portion of raw leaves.

Our other orders were a classic over easy eggs with spicy seasoned potatoes with an xtra side of waffles.  Since they had to re-fire the eggs benedict, the egg was luke warm and waffles were not as golden crispy as we liked.

Whoever made our batch of coffee added too much water as it was missing that needed caffeine perk.  Im sensitive to caffeine and even I thought it was too weak.  

We love the vibe of this breakfast spot, so hopefully, it will be a win next time.",0,0,0

I was able to try the combo meat skillet, beef hash skillet, and the stuffed french toast. Everything tasted homemade which places it above chain breakfast restaurants, but I think all cities have some sort of a joint that serves similar tasting dishes.

One thing that stood out was their banana nut muffin. Choose it over the toast, when asked what you prefer. This was the only thing that was better than anywhere else I have tried. I'm not a big fan of BNut, but if it tasted like the ones here, I would choose it every time.

It was really tasty but the 3 Eggs-cellent Omelettes at the table kept overshadowing my dish. But that was my fault and not the fault of Egg & I.

Told the waitress they forgot it and to forget about bringing it. She began to goad me on to get avocado, which was strange after saying no several times. I repeated that it was fine; at that point i didn't care for it. Eventually I submitted but asked for only a little amount of avocado. She brings me avocado and soon after - the check. I look at the check, no avocado charge. I was happy, and ready to pay. A few minutes later, she sneakily replaces the check with a brand new one. I hardly noticed that she had done that and after looking at the check again, a $3 avocado charge made me cringe. Wtf? If it was your mistake and I said I was fine on avocado, why would you goad me on to get it? Then give me a check without it (again forgetting, but this time you forgot to charge me so might as well leave it), and replace it with a ridiculous charge? And do not call your customers ""babe"", it's just weird especially when you say it behind them. ""Thanks babe"" - as I was holding the check in my hand. Thanks? No thanks lol.I wish I remembered her name, but she was some older red-haired lady. I was not pleased with this incident.
Also, their ""Habla Diablo"" potatoes, which comes with every meal, are horrendous. They taste like over seasoned, beyond-salty fast food potatoes. 2 stars for getting seated quick, polite service, and a banana ""nut"" muffin for a side, despite the fact that it was overly sweet and did not receive the slightest bit of nutty flavor.

3.  Portions are VERY generous and filling.
4.  Service is outstanding with many smiles (thank you Amanda).  =)
5.  Hot sauce selection extends from regular tabasco and tapatio (thank goodness!).

7.  Homemade banana nut muffin.
8.  Parking in a shared lot.

I've ordered their oatmeal, their scrambles, their wonderful blueberry pancakes that they make with multi-grain (or was it whole wheat?). I'm not sure if I ever ordered anything that wasn't good.

Their service has been great so far. They have that nifty system of turning your egg sign on your table if you need service. I'd have to say their wait staff has always been efficient and attentive.

We often frequent Egg Works, Cracked Egg, I'm not sure if it's all owned by the same company. Their menus are slightly different, some serve coffee cakes, some serve muffins. You can't really miss with either one, they are all delicious.

We had the tuna melt, the Sundance Special, and the flavored coffee (partner's idea). The Sundance Special, a veggie omelet with thought behind it, was actually pretty yummy (artichoke, feta, spinach...great flavors), but the potatoes that come with were pretty yucky. Just cubed potatoes that are overly seasoned and taste previously frozen, not that fresh.

The tuna melt was the WORST I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE. SOOOOO BAD! The ""cheese"" looked like a non-melting version of Velveeta. I'm not sure it was real. I had to scrape it off; it was disgusting. Also the tuna salad part was the worst tuna salad ever. It was a mushy, wet, flavorless glob of mayonnaise mess. The Parmesan bread it comes on is super-salty. The matchstick fries it comes with don't taste that fresh and are overly spiced.

I picked the sandwich to pieces, and most pieces remained on my plate. I ate my partner's Sundance Special, because Vegas portion sizes allow for that. The server didn't even bother to ask how our food was, just slapped the check down and didn't comment that I had barely touched my plate.

The flavored coffee (hazelnut) is really gross. Bad idea to order it, but it tastes like the bad idea it is--overly sweet with its sweetness covering up that burnt taste that most diner coffee has.

The food is mediocre and the portions are so large that it's unhealthy. The service is also pretty bad. When we arrived the hostess seated us at a  with unraveled silverware and a five dollar bill still sitting on the table. She gave us our menu's and left the money awkwardly sitting there. 

When we finally got to put in our orders our waitress recommended that we take a half portion of our cheese, egg and veggie skillet breakfast dish and I'm so glad she did. The half portion was like a full portion and I could barely finish it, as it had so much thick sticky cheese on top. Also, the seasoning that they put on the potatoes tastes exactly like Dorritos and I felt like I was eating potato chips (not in a good way). 

Also I just wanted to note something that happened while were waiting for our food to come. The waitress hastily sat us at a 5 top (it was just my bf and I). A family of 5 came in about 10 minutes after us and she tried to sit them in the table next to us which could not accommodate anymore than 4 people. She grabbed a chair from our table to try and seat them there, but the family was really unhappy, it was especially awkward as we were sitting at the only table that could fit them. She then moved them somewhere to the other side of the room. I saw the family leave a few minutes later out of frustration.

This place was super popular on Yelp and won so many local awards, we were forced to check it out. Arrived early afternoon, there was pretty much no wait, even though there were some customers lingering near the entrance inside and the place was still full! Service was extremely down-to-earth, friendly, and attentive!

This place has a huge menu (in the form of a ""newspaper""...if that gives you some idea). There were so many choices it was really hard to decide on just one =( The variety is vast, but the bulk of the items were simple, straightforward, typical breakfast dishes with unique modifications\/twists or add-ons. My husband's chile relleno omelet was such a great idea for an omelet...the juicy chile and the cheese tasted amazing wrapped in egg! My benedict's garden (vegetarian version of egg's benedict) was superb as well. Even though one of the items listed in my dish was guacamole, I was SO pleasantly surprised when it arrived NOT as guacamole, but pretty much a whole avocado sliced up!!! You don't get that often, even in California! +10 points for that! The whole combination of poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, and avocado was such a delicious creamy mix, and perfectly-balanced by the crisp freshness of the tomatoes. I basically devoured it in under 5 minutes...and then had to wait for the husband to finish his plate *rolls eyes.* We both agreed that their seasoned potatoes were freaking AMAZING. We don't know what kind of seasoning they use, but it reminded us of Cajun and it was to die for. I wish they sold it by the bottle!

If that doesn't sound appealing to you, they have a lengthy menu of options (including those that are healthy) that will make it difficult to decide. In my opinion, the menu primarily consists of classics and southwest combinations, however, I also noted Island\/Hawaiian style selections. It's somewhat of an odd array, but you can't go wrong. 

The restaurant is located in an isolate shopping plaza with plenty of parking. Wait times are long; I suggest you plan for an hour of that (during peak times), with limited seating, so you may have to stand outside with the overflow. However, once seated, the service is very fast and friendly.

I had the pleasure of dining here for brunch. Make sure to come early to beat the long lines because this place can get packed. Their menu has a wide variety of choices that you can choose from. But whatever you order, make sure that you get the banana nut muffin.

1. Sundance Omelette: It's the ultimate healthy veggie omelette. With feta cheese, spinach, tomatoes, and other deliciousness. I really liked the omelette. It comes with potatoes and your choice of toast or muffin. Get the muffin! All plates are pretty hearty, so this choice makes me feel less guilty of eating a lot of food haha (5\/5)

2. Cordon Bleu Skillet: Comes with seasoned chicken breast, diced ham, swiss cheese and delicious potatoes. This one tastes great with easy over eggs. Very flavorful and savory. Overall, a great one to choose from (5\/5)

The service here is friendly. Prices are reasonable as the portion sizes here are HUGE. Credit cards accepted. Plenty of parking.",4,3,3

If you need anything, you can flip a cardboard egg on your table from black to yellow, and someone comes within minutes to see what you need. That, plus everyone gets a table-side carafe of coffee, were huge pluses. 

Unfortunately the pluses didn't completely overshadow the fact that our waitress messed up both our orders. My wife's veggie omelet, hold the onions, was stuffed with onions. My Cali omelet, the special for the morning, for some reason and as egg whites. I didn't want to wait for another one, so I just ate it. It didn't have much flavor as a result.

An IV, close... Breakfast.  The Egg & I is not to far off the strip, only about a mile depending on where you stay.  We took the back roads from Caesars and our ETA was about 5 minutes. 

The coolest thing is their ""happy egg, sad egg"" stand at the edge of the table.  Whenever you need something like a drink refill, or if you have a problem with anything, just flip the egg from the happy black face to the sad yellow face.  We tested this unique method of customer service and within seconds we had our waitress back at the table asking if we needed anything.  Even without flipping the egg the waitress was very attentive.

After you get your drinks the waitress will bring you a fresh baked banana nut muffin.  My buddy thought he was flirting with the waitress, and they totally were, so he made us all thank him graciously for the 2 muffins.  Then after 30 seconds of looking around, you realize everyone gets a muffin.  *Sad egg face Jordan, sorry :^(   But the muffin is warm and delicious.  

We had a party of 4 and we all got something different and it was all great.  I got chicken fried steak covered in gravy atop a mound of ranch potatoes with 3 fried eggs on top, and the best part about it was... they CUT it up for you!  This is when I found out I am lazy because you know you're lazy when you get excited about your food coming pre-cut.  The chicken breast was moist and the outside was perfectly crisp, and with every bite the batter unleashed a flurry of flavor.  Mouth watering.  The hype about their ranch potatoes is true.  They are really good and live up to the expectations other yelpers have set fourth.  I haven't had anything quite like them ever before.  My plate also came with a side of fresh seasonal fruit and a biscuit for gravy dunking. 

The rest of the gang ordered: eggs benedict, the breakfast burrito, and a plain jane 2-egg breakfast with bacon.  All of which was worth the wait on a Sunday morning.

5-Stars for the overall experience.  The waitress was cute and friendly even if she didn't give Jordan a muffin because he was ""special,"" their happy egg \/ sad egg system works well when you need something in a pinch, the superior quality of the food and the prices are great especially after losing a couple G's at the tables in Vegas.",3,2,2

The 4 of us decided to stop in here for breakfast before making the 10 hour trip back home. We decided to give this place a try as it had really good reviews. 

We got in and got seated pretty fast, there was quite a few people. I ordered a vanilla latte coffee whatever and it was way too sweet. I feel like I might have gotten diabetes from that coffee. 

Aftwr looking at the newspaper menu for a few minutes I decided on the chicken fried steak skillet since I am a big fan of all things chicken friend. The 3 others got the Mexican omelet, I believe that is what it was called. 

The food came out pretty quick, first glance at my chicken fried skillet made me queesy but I was hungry and I thought it can't be that bad. The country gravy was gelatinous. It was weird. Like a slime blob of gravy exploded all over my food. Whatever. Give it a try. 

It didn't taste that bad but it didn't taste good. It was very salty and I just couldn't get over the slime gravy so I stopped eating. Everyone else with their Mexican omelet had tears streaming down their face. Apparently the omelet was too spicy to even enjoy. My partner is Mexican and loves her spicy foods. She is obsessed with all things spicy, tears will be streaking down her face and she will still say it isn't spicy enough, but even she struggled with the omelet. Maybe not that it was too spicy but that it tasted like crap spicy. 

Anyways, about 10 minutes after trying to eat my slime it hit me like a brick, I made a beeline to the bathroom and was in there for about 10 minutes only to return 5 more times. 

As you can imagine the 10 hour car ride home was horrible. Never again.",0,0,0

I found this on yelp and saw the reviews.  I got the half order of eggs bennie and stuffed french toast.  My goodness!!!! What a meal!! I also had the coffee and all I added was two creamers, no sugar needed (I was getting enough from the french toast). The waitress was sweet enough to suggest half orders on the dishes.  My husband had the enchiladas and he loved them as well.  I didn't care for them as much- maybe since I wanted the sweet stuff.  This place is a must for anyone in the Vegas area.  It's obvious that they don't need my review- they are packed, but it's nice to be able to visit a great place like this. You will be amazed by the food and the service was great!!

If I was a 300# football player I could have finished my meal. The food was good but a bit to plentiful for our tastes. I liked the happy \/ sad face egg flippable sign to alert the serving staff of service status.

The most impressive attribute I found was the staff seemed so happy, positive and upbeat! 

Judging from the level of activity, this place does a great deal of business and I wish them the best. For some constructive criticism ..... investing in some better quality flatware will elevate the perception of quality and will do much in justifying the relatively high prices.",0,0,0

On the first day I got the ultimate skillet (no cheese) with Portuguese sausage instead of regular sausage (reminded me of Hawaii).  It had bacon, sausage, peppers, ranch potatoes and other deliciousness topped with 2 eggs over easy.   Super great! Also, the server gave me an ice tea to take with me.  The service was pretty good - it was packed but it seems the staff actually pays attention to the system of ""frowny egg""\/ ""happy egg"" because when we put the frowny egg on for more coffee, people came immediately.  
The second day I got the prime rib benedict but with guacamole instead of hollandaise sauce.  That was awesome!  They were actually too generous with the guac and I had to leave some behind on my skillet.  Service was again pretty good, but we got the same waiter who remembered us.

Egg & I is located off strip, east of the 15 off of the sahara exit. its located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. there is indoor and outdoor seating. there were a few people waiting when we arrived but we were quickly seated. the place was full with a few tables empty. we were expecting to wait but it was already about 10AM by the time we went. 

i ordered the strawberry and cream french toast which was thick slices of soft french toast with a strawberry whipped cream cheese and strawberry preserves on top. it was pretty good. i liked that it wasnt too sweet like most french toast\/waffles with fruit toppings at other restaurants.

the bf ordered the fiesta skillet with chorizo. it had green chili, onions and salsa. i thought it was gonna be sausage type of chorizo but it was the ground kind. if you've ever cooked or bought it at the market you know what im talking about. when you cook it, it pretty much just melts. so the skillet was as if it had chili on top. it was pretty heavy and greasy. i could probably do without the chorizo next time.

the bfs bro ordered the country fried steak skillet. this had chopped chunks of country fried steak with their homestyle potatoes and eggs with white gravy on top. it was pretty good. it tasted just like a regular country fried steak plate but all chopped up for you, if you dont mind your food touching (i know some people who dont, like my 5 yr old nephew...).

bfs bro's fiance ordered the stuffed french toast. this was two pieces of their thick sliced fluffy french toast with an omelet in between. the eggs had lots of bits of bacon in it which made it tasty but it was pretty firm. i felt like it was over cooked. maybe it was all the cheese. it tasted good though. it tasted good with either the syrup and\/or ketchup. sweet or savory, whichever you prefer. 

we had also had a side of the banana nut muffin, which was pretty good. it was large on top. it wasnt too sweet which was nice. it came out moist and warm. yum!

Part of the plan has you delaying breakfast until you get to Las Vegas, and the plan is working pretty well so far.  At Barstow you get out your phone and you begin to review the non casino options in Las Vegas when 'Egg and I' leaps out with these great reviews and a fantastic star rating.  Sold!  That's where we're going to go.

When we check-in on yelp we get a free Banana Nut Muffin, and things seem to be fantastic.

Our server is charismatic, checks in often, provides us with a pitcher of water (its something like 100 degrees outside and rising), and was efficient throughout the meal.

Our omelettes arrive in a timely fashion, and so what is their to complain about.  

First, I like cheese, and so having cheese is always a good thing, and for you this may be a big plus, but there was so much cheese it was hard to taste anything else.  I had ordered the chile rellano omelette, and it arrived as advertised, but with just a ton of cheese.  

Second, the potatoes looked to be cubed by a machine, frozen, de-frosted, and then lightly seasoned prior to arrival.  They were very disappointing.  

Third, my expectations were way too high.  My fellow yelpers love this place, and so I was expecting this amazing breakfast that just didn't live up to my expectations.

In a nutshell, I'd probably go back, but with a whole different set of expectations, knowing that I'd ask for sliced tomatoes instead of the potatoes, and I'd probably not choose an omelette.

Be sure and check in, a free muffin is not a bad thing.",2,1,1

It was really busy when we arrived but the wait wasn't too terrible. We were seated inside, and it was really bustling. 
With our Yelp check-in, we each received a free banana nut muffin, which was REALLY tasty. I ordered the Vegetarian Benedict (with bacon) and my husband ordered the Biscuits and Gravy and Blueberry Pancakes. My Benedict was really, really good, but I will say their hollandaise is seriously lacking in lemon juice. It didn't seem like an authentic hollandaise at all, but it tasted good. They know how to poach an egg beautifully, which made up for the sauce. The breakfast potatoes that come with every entree are very flavorful and crispy. My husband really liked his biscuits & gravy (he said the biscuits were very light and fluffy), but the pancakes were a huge bust for both of us. They were way too dense - the texture was pretty awful. I'm assuming that's how all their pancake batter is, so I'd hard pass on pancakes there. 
It was fun to venture off the Strip, but we'll probably stick with breakfast elsewhere in the future. HOWEVER, they offer an extremely generous military discount of 30%, which we appreciated.

I can't turn down fresh squeezed OJ. This restaurant has delicious OJ. You should try it at least once. I love their menu. They have interesting combinations, like chicken, pesto, and eggs, and delicious twists on common breakfast dishes, like French toast. I love the scrambles the most, and would  often get the veggie scramble sitting atop ranch potatoes. Slather that mound with hot sauce and call it a day. Expect an exhilerating food coma to follow. The portions are big. I also recommend trying their complimentary banana nut muffin at least once. I don't like muffins or bananas, seriously, but I like theirs. Be adventurous, don't order eggs and a side of bacon. Live it up a little...

Super awesome service. Expect to wait on the weekends for breakfast\/brunch, but they have a quick turn-around and great waiters\/waitresses. A nice perk to the crowded atmosphere is an egg on the table that you can flip when you require service. On a very busy day it's very helpful to the staff, and don't be afraid to use it!

To me, flavor was great, consistency of the gravy was perfect (not too thick or thin), country fried steak was moist and very crispy, eggs were prepared perfectly and the potatoes were very crispy (potatoes were moist and seasoned well - but also salty in a good way!).

I guess b\/c I had such a great experience with EGG WORKS their sister place I had put this place on such a high pedestal and they fell off... and no all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put this bk together again. 

ENTREE: my bf got the franciscan scramble. sounded really good and he's a professional order-er. Its amazing to watch him work. Everything he orders always comes out spectacular and the best tasting dish at the table. not me.  I had a the tostada last time and I had really wanted the cobb salad but was torn. So this time cobb salad was my only request. 
disguisting. 

COBB: I love cobb salads. This was just plain GROSS. they probably gave me 3-4 lbs of ICEBURG LETTUCE. really? iceburg? gross.  the croutons were the 99 cent croutons with the green specks on it. They gave me 1\/4 of an egg... at a a place with the word EGG in it.. i was very disappointed. You'd think theyere 'd be at least a full egg? maybe 2. no.
on top of my salad was a lil bit of shredded cheese, and some deli sliced sandwich meat turkey and ham (not even cubes) and the box of sprouts sittong on top of my salad. i ordered blue cheese dressing, they brought me ranch. anything that could go wrong did. 2nd worst meal i've had in las vegas since I've lived here. 

Maybe its my fault? my fault for ordering anything that wasnt scrambled so early in the morning. I take some responsibility in that I guess. my bf's omelet was delicious. the potatoes were good.. so was his banana nut muffin.. (while my bran muffin was gross) it was just the perfect yin\/yang of good vs. evil... , er mavs vs the heat, the cowboys vs the 49ers, egg works vs egg & I... and yes good food vs. bad food. 

The only reason I gave them 2stars was b\/c of the bfs food was 4 stars cancelled out by my zero stars.. to equal 2. :)

I can't tell you how many people get a omelette wrong. Either the ingredients don't gel right and is tasteless, or the egg is undercooked, etc. 
The omelette I got here was tasteless. The potato o' brien was overcooked in too much oil to the point it was deflated and tasted more like leftovers.

I intended to get my butt up at 5 am and be at their door at 6 am when they opened, but my brain determined I needed sleep more than food and I ended up putting my name down at noon-thirty, at the height of brunch\/lunch time. I was told the wait was about 15 minutes; I waited a solid 20 (which isn't bad when ""15 minutes"" usually serves as code for half-an-hour) and was promptly greeted by my wonderful server. I had my food about 10 minutes after I placed my order.

My late uncle was a gourmet chef, and my earliest, fondest memories of Vegas revolve around eating his cooking. Biscuits and gravy were on the usual menu when my family and I made our annual road trip out here, and I have purposely shied away from ever ordering it because nothing could ever come close.

But, for some reason, I ordered it anyway here. Was it as good as my Uncle Ray's? 

Does the free show in front TI have anything to do with pirates anymore?

Exactly. But that said, I would probably order it again. I regret not remembering my server's name, but she's one of the best I've had in a LONG time, and as someone that waited tables and bartended her way through school, my standards of service are ridiculously high. She was awesome, and was warmer, more attentive and professional than any server I've had elsewhere in Vegas, even in those pretentious ""five-star"" restaurants you'll find in abundance in this city.

Keep in mind they're open from 6 am - 3 pm. I was told by a girl at the host desk that the best time to go was 6-8 and after 1:30.

Overall value?

Price: 3.5
Service: 5

Long version:  So I'm on vacation with my two adult sons (and one of the boy's GF).  Since we're at a timeshare I'm enjoying making breakfast most of the week.  On a lark I decide we're going out, and I google ""best las vegas breakfast"".  #1 on the list is ""The Egg and I"".  So we map it and off we go, without a lot of expectations or knowing what's on the menu.  

So first of all there's a bit of a wait - 15-20 minutes for a table.  Staff is friendly, place is clean, and every table is filled.  We are seated outdoors on the patio and there are heaters set up (the stand-up propane ones) every couple of tables so we're nice and cozy.

Coffee comes and guess what - it's really good.  I'm a bit of a coffee fanatic - I roast my own beans at home and can distinguish varietals between African and South American by taste - and it's surprisingly lively on the palette for a breakfast joint.

Between the four of us, we order a vegan breakfast, two different omelets and biscuits and gravy.  Each entry is under $10, and the portions are absolutely ginormous.  It's a quarter to midnight and I'm still stuffed.  

But most importantly, every thing on the plate is absolutely delicious.  From the specialty omelets to the potatoes to the gravy, everything is simply first rate.  

Apparently the place has won several awards and is Zagat rated.  I have no reason to doubt any of this - if you're in Las Vegas for breakfast, you absolutely MUST search out and try The Egg and I.",0,0,0

Maybe because breakfast is my favorite? I had The Classic with bacon- two eggs over medium, bacon, potatoes, and a banana muffin. Everything was great, but the potatoes stole the show! So super crispy and seasoned marvelously! Seriously, so good. Now I have to figure out how they made the potatoes so crispy! Definitely will visit on any future Vegas trips. The service was also top-notch. My waitress was very friendly and attentive.",0,0,0

We only discovered it since our hotel (The Artisan) was nearby and we used our Yelp app to find the closet breakfast place that wasn't a buffet (by day 3 of buffet hopping, I needed major portion control).

Even though it was Mother's Day and the line was out the door, this tiny restaurant somehow managed to get everyone seated quickly and keep diners moving through the door. The menu was quite extensive for breakfast with everything from stuffed french toast to eggs benedict to the infamous breakfast burrito. I tried the eggs benedict, which came with ranch potatoes and a huge portion of fruit. The orange juice was the best part though, it tasted like it was just squeezed in the kitchen.

Me and a friend came to catch up on things and I recently recruited her to Yelp and had her check in. With the check in we each got the banana nut muffin. Which was a 5 out of 5 Yelp star rating. For breakfast I always stick to the basics so I usually always order ""the classic"". Which comes with eggs, one choice of meat (bacon, sausage and I must note each come in turkey too), potatoes & toast. My friend got the ""Country Benny"" which she was very pleased with. Earl checked on our table throughout our whole visit. Also, if you've been to any of the chain restaurants then you know they have this egg shaped smiley face that you can flip to a sad face to grab anyone's attention for service. Needless to say, we didn't have to use it. Oh and Earl kindly offered me each type of creamer they had for my coffee! So for the first time there I didn't have to have plan old half & half.

After glancing through their newspaper styled menu, I decided to have a four egg omelette.  Which was more than delicious when it arrived.  Accompanying this wonderful omelette was their famous ranch potatoes.  These bad boys were orgasmic good.  They were seasoned with some spices that gave it a lil bit of a kick.  But if you aren't into spicy then I advise you put some ketchup on them to dull the fire.  All in all the meal was delicious.

The service was pretty good as well.  They have a system where there is a napkin holder and on top are two pictures of eggs.  If you need some assistance then you just flip the egg to yellow.

Gets a little busy so don't go in a hurry but I like this place a lot. I want to give them a 5 star so maybe I could update later if some minor things change.

Checkout line gets pretty long almost every time so they need 2 cashiers or a faster system.

It takes awhile to get seated sometimes but they did update the seating list so you can get a text when your table is ready. It gives you an estimate on how long the wait will be.  Our quote said 15 minute wait to get seated but it was 21 min, it was a group of 6 during busy time so not bad and that was the longest I have waited.

Food is pretty good, chorizo burrito and mashed potato omelette are very edible. 

I really wish they wouldn't give you so many of those weird potatoes though. They are pretty good but not good enough to finish or take home, so almost every customer is sure to throw away a lot, my guess is they through away a few hundred pounds of potatoes every single day because no one finishes them. I would recommend they give you half the amount of potatoes and some fruit which would be so much easier on the stomach and make the meals a little less boring. 

I do recommend to stop by and give this place a try though. I will certainly be back soon.

Any place that offers a turkey sausage option is awesome for me as a non pork-eater. The real star of the plate was the pancakes. They were perfection!

I called in my order, simple two omelet, with some fruit and tomatoes on the side. Nothing crazy. So I got thought the extended diatribe on the phone clarifying and identify I understand the extra charges for a side of tomatoes, the cashier says 10 minutes.
I get to the restaurant about 6 minutes later only to sit and wait another 20 or so, the price of which had never been disclosed to me. $11 per 4-egg omelet. I was a little shocked, but then my order was also wrong, they missed my extras and wanted to charge me even more for simple stuff like an ounce of tomatoes. I'm trying to grin and bare it, when the cashier dashes off without a word to get her manager, because she doesn't actually know the cost of said side of tomatoes. The manager comes out with a half -ass-ed apology and an offer to ""take care of me"" the NEXT time I choose to suffer through this establishment's shotty service.
So now that I've arrived at my office a whole 3 minute drive away, My fruit cup was leaking all over the bag of food. Each meal was luke warm, the ranch potatoes nearly broke a tong of my plastic fork, which we received one less than requested. My crazy chicken  omelet, which is described as ""Loaded with julienned chicken breast, fresh mushrooms and guacamole. Topped with muenster cheese and sour cream."" on the website, had flavorless dark meat chicken, and mushy old guacamole that was terrible.

I can't really agree with that but it's pretty darn good.  I ordered the corned beef hash and what came wasn't your standard canned mushed beef stuff. There were real pieces of corned beef in this mixed with potatoes, onions, red, green peepers and topped with 2 eggs of your choice, which should always be over easy eggs with super sloppy running yolks. The flavors were spot on and the side of potatoes were nice.  The banana muffin that is served is awesome too.  It's probably microwaved before getting to your table but it's still very decent.

Got there about 9:00 a.m. on a Tuesday, and although the place was busy, it wasn't packed, so there was no wait for a table.  Started with coffee which was surprisingly good - very mellow with a good flavor.  I even thought about asking what kind of coffee they use, but unfortunately forgot.

I ordered my favorite - corned beef hash and eggs, while the lady ordered country fried steak.  CBH was in a soft patty form.  The corned beef was of the finely-shredded variety probably from a can, so don't expect chunks from a brisket they brined and carved themselves.  I'm not complaining - the stuff was tasty.  The two eggs on top were done a nice over easy.  I wasn't a fan of their Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, which tasted okay, but were a little too loose for me - like if you tried to scoop them with your fork instead of stabbing them, they would just fall off.  I like hash browns, home fries, etc. that stick together a bit so you can put them on the same bite as the CBH\/egg\/omelette\/etc.  I can't believe it's just me.  Right?

The lady's country fried steak was tender and tasty.  Not out of this world, but certainly better than you'd get at an IHOP.  While I had wheat toast, she chose the banana muffin, which was great - just filling, so with the good portions of the rest of out breakfasts, we couldn't finish it.

Service was friendly, and the prices were reasonable.  I'd definitely come back.",1,0,0

Takes: The best friend and I literally planned our Vegas trip around our meals! She's the breakfast person of the two of us, and she ultimately chose Egg and I of the two places I suggested.

Two words: No regrets!

The corned beef was the homemade, pulled type of thing, and not your typical canned corned beef! The Sundance omelette is your veggie omelette complete with a side of potatoes and your choice between a banana nut muffin or toast. This omelette had mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and artichokes. The feta cheese is the one that brings this omelette home! The only downside is that protein is extra; I ordered a small side of corned beef. The potatoes were seasoned (they are on the salty side, but nothing ketchup couldn't counteract). The banana nut muffin came out warm and moist! It definitely was the highlight at first bite! 

Portion size: Large! Both of us took home leftovers! We went from stomach growling to food baby status after our meal.

Service: You flip the egg to the sad one when you need something. Our servers were very friendly and patient. They gave us recommendations on the menu, one even offered us free muffins for our first visit (before the Yelp check in).

Wait Time: immediately seated on a Monday morning

Parking: Shared Lot

We were looking for a place to have a good breakfast before heading out on the road back to Phoenix.  We had been in Vegas for four nights and were looking for something other than the options around our hotel.  I found the Egg & I using my awesome Yelp iPhone app.  Everyone agreed to give it a shot and we were all singing praises to both Egg & I and to Yelp at the end of the meal.

The special of the day was the Prime Rib Skillet, Prime Rib over breakfast potatoes, cheese, and eggs any way you want em.  Two people at our table of six went for the special.  Other meals included a Brad's Scramble, two Chicken Fried Steak Skillets, and mine was the Kay's Omelette (Four egg spinach omelette stuffed with a blend of artichoke hearts, swiss cheese, parmesan, garlic and cream cheese. Topped with fresh tomatoes and feta cheese.)  Everyone was raving about their breakfast, except for one.

One friend does not like mushrooms and did not realize they were in her skillet.  She started to pick them out and when the waitress same to check on us, she noticed the pile of mushrooms and offered to have them remake the dish.  Very nice customer service.  My friend didn't want to wait, so she declined, but it was still very nice of the server to notice and offer a new dish.

The standout of the meal was the breakfast potatoes with their special seasoning.  These are the best breakfast potatoes that I have ever had, and I love breakfast potatoes!  The seasoning had a really good flavor and the potatoes were in the perfect bite-sized chunks.

There are plenty of great reviews for this place, so I don't need to go on and on.  Just one more final thought.  When I am coming home from a trip I always like to look back and think about what I learned during the trip.  On this trip, I learned a few things . . .

1 - Don't hold your new cell phone over a pint of Guinness, chances are it may fall in.
2 - Cash out at roulette once you have doubled your original bet.  Even if you just walk right back and put down the original bet again.
3 - Add the Egg & I to the ""must-have"" list anytime I'm in Vegas!",2,0,1

I loved this restaurant.  We only had to wait 15 minutes on a Sunday morning and were kindly seated.  The restaurant is a good size and was cutely decorated.  It's a really good family and brunch place.  

I ordered an omelette and enjoyed it a lot.  The portions are generous here.  The best part of this place is the service.  Our server (older Hispanic lady) was very funny and recommended different things for us.  I was being picky and she let me.  Thanks, ma'am!  The roasted potatoes here are really good.  I like hashed browns a lot and never really like home potatoes, but for once the potatoes trumped the hashed browns.  They were crispy and lightly seasoned.

I tried the chocolate chip pumpkin pancakes and the tasted absolutely AMAZING!  I couldn't stop eating them even though I was full.  I also had a bite of someone's French toast sandwich, and oh my gosh, did that taste like heaven in my mouth!!!!!  If you're ok with a heart attack on a plate, this is it.  It was a huge portion of eggs, bacon, ham, and sausage goodness.  This was probably the tastiest thing on the menu, and I had only a bite.  Definitely something you can share if you're not too hungry.  Great service and good value for the dollar!

My husband told me that he used to eat here with his grandparents when they lived in Vegas. It's located in an older plaza and from the outside did not look busy.  We arrived around 9:00AM and it was pretty packed inside, but we were seated at a table right away.  I ordered the Sundance Special (veggie omelette with spinach, mushrooms, artichoke hearts folded with Swiss cheese and a special Works artichoke cheese filling, topped with Feta cheese and fresh tomatoes). I also got potatoes and a banana nut muffin. 

Our server was really nice. The food was so good! Honestly, the best veggie omelet I've ever tried. The banana nut muffin was also a delicious treat and so moist.

I'd definitely come here again when we are in the area.

We had a party of five and waited all of about two minutes to be seated. We must have hit the right time of morning because the place was jammed by the time we left. Well worth any wait. 

Food - The menu was expansive. So many items to choose from. I had the Three Pig Omelette with a side of their excellent hollandaise sauce. Superb. My son was pleased with his waffle. My wife, who is not a huge breakfast fan, was thrilled to see she could get an egg white omelette. She commented that you never really know how egg white dishes will turn out. She raved about her egg white veggie omelette. The two others in our party had the the biscuits and gravy and loco moco respectively. The biscuits and gravy were a hit while the loco moco was remarkably reminiscent to the Hawaiian Islands favorite dish. 

Service - The service was exceptional. In an industry where service can significantly impact the diner's experience, Oscar was fantastic. Oscar was well versed in his menu knowledge and was quick to offer recommendations and to gladly accept order substitutions. His pleasant, respectful, and appreciative demeanor really helped to set our dining experience apart from every other experience while in town. He was also aware and kind enough to notice the kitchen was getting backed up so he brought out a plateful of banana nut muffins to help stunt the growing hunger we all were suffering.

I came here with 4 of my other friends while we were in Vegas and all of us had a positive experience.  Both the food and the service were ""egg-cellent.""  

Anyhow, I try to be a little bit pun-ny at times and this is one of them.

First off, the SERVICE was great.  We came in around noon time and the restaurant was mostly crowded but our group of 5 was seated as soon as we walked in the door.  We were greeted by the hostess with a big smile and much enthusiasm.  What's interesting is that their menu is in the form of a newspaper, which is very creative and something I've never seen before.  Our waitress, Amanda, was very energetic and did a wonderful job.  She was very helpful with her recommendations, very quick, and very genuinely friendly.  I love it when the people at a restaurant enjoy what they do.  

As for the FOOD, my friends and I ordered different dishes but everyone enjoyed their meal.  I ordered a hawaiian dish that came with rice, eggs, and spam.  You could also have your choice of sausage.  Now, I know it sounds plain from the description but it was probably the best breakfast of those items I""ve ever had.  Everything was prepared perfectly and also presented well.  I had two eggs that were made over-well, hot and juicy sausage that was perfectly seasoned and two mounds of perfectly scooped rice.  Also, before our dishes were served, we were given complimentary appetizers in the form of a banana nut muffin.  It was the best banana nut muffin I've ever tasted because it came out warm and seemed to be freshly made.

My other friends ordered the country fried chicken breast skillet as well as a turkey sandwich that they happily shared with me.  I got to try it and it was just as excellent tasting as my dish.  The portion sizes were generous and all of us were stuffed by the end of the meal.

What I found interesting was that they had a little sign in the shape of an egg that had two sides.  It was used to signal our waitress if we were in need of some help.  One side of the sign had a smiling egg and another had an egg with a sad face.  Apparently you are supposed to flip it to the sad facing egg side if you needed service.  Anyhow, the last part might not make sense until you actually go there...but it beats any breakfast place on the strip that I've been too!

Lastly, the PRICE is extremely affordable.  An entire meal for one person was about $9-$10 before tax and tip.  I sort of wish they had one in Orange County but I'll definitely come back here with friends the next time I visit vegas.",2,1,1

This breakfast joint is cute, welcoming and homey. It gets pretty packed during the weekends, especially with big parties, so be prepared to wait! But if anything, the food is worth the wait.

The selection of different types of dishes included dozens of omelettes done all kinds of ways, eggs benedict, eggs florentine, egg crepes, skillets, and i could go on and on because they also have sandwiches, french toast, and seriously I can go on.. 

I got the ham and mushrooms skillet with blue berry muffin. The muffin was moist and fresh! The skillet was their infamous ranch potatoes topped with ham and mushrooms with a layer of melted cheeses and two eggs done however you liked. Honestly, it looked super huge and I thought I would not finish it, but it was so good I annihilated that sucker!  My friend tried the ultimate skillet which had ham, bacon,  sausage and other goodies, but he said that it was waaaay too many things going on in one dish. So unless you like something super hearty and packed, try the ultimate skillet, if not, choose one or two ingredients to put into it.

Service was super friendly and kind. On the table there are these flip cards with a happy and sad face. Put up your happy face is your party is doing fine, but if you need anything put up the sad face and a server will attend to you quickly.

Sadly, none of us took our food to go because we were on the road doing errands that day.

I can honestly say that the steggs(steak and egg) is better here compared to babystax. They don't have red velvet pancakes though, don't come here for that and be disappointed. Egg works bennys are farrrrr more tastier and better than babystax. It has much better flavoring. The potatoes on the side is seasoned really well. Can even preach that their potatoes fries taste better than babystax potatoes fries. The price here is cheaper than babystax. The only downside is the pancakes. Their pancakes and banana nut muffin was not good at all.",2,0,1

 So I had the eggs florentine which was really good. My motto is the more fattening the better.

2) Sausage gravy + sausage patty: a little on the salty side, but I thought it had a good balance of chunkiness and creaminess. I'm a bit of a sausage gravy aficionado (haha) though, so it may be that my standards are oddly high.
3) Banana Nut Muffin: needs it's own category, even if it's a side! Delicious delicious. Moist and warm, not too sweet.

This was a little worrisome, but we soon realized that this said far more about the Vegas population than it did about the quality of the breakfast.  Here's the best recommendation I can give about the food: I came back for breakfast the next day!  And we would have come back the third morning except that we had to be on the road before they opened at 6am!

We got off to a good start.  When the waitress found out this was our first visit, she brought us a warm banana nut muffin to try.  It's a house special and well worth getting.

When you open up the newspaper-like menu, the first thing you'll notice is the words Habla Diablo in blazing red appearing in the descriptions of at least half the dishes.  My wife wanted the Spinach Benny, but was concerned about the Habla Diablo potatoes because the name sounded spicy and she's a self-proclaimed spice wimp.  The waitress explained that it wasn't spicy at all, that Habla Diablo is the owner's side company and he had just redone the menu to emphasize his products.  My wife went ahead with her spinach benny and I got the loco moco, with an extra side of the Habla Diablo potatoes.  (It turns out that the Habla Diablo seasoning is a lot like Lawry's Seasoned Salt.)

My wife really liked her spinach benny, but didn't care for the potatoes.  (But she's not a big fan of breakfast potatoes to begin with.)  I liked the potatoes and finished most of hers in addition to mine.  Plus the loco moco was the best I've had on the mainland!

The next day, I came back on my own, but with orders to bring back something good to my wife in the hotel.  This time I had the Biscuits & Gravy, which were great.  But, fair warning, they were pretty salty -- well within my tolerance, but if you are sensitive to salt, you might want to steer clear.   Then I picked out the California Crepe for my wife, which the waitress was happy to pack up for me to take back.  I asked to substitute some fruit for the Habla Diablo potatoes, and she packed up a huge container of fresh fruit.  My wife loved the California Crepe, except for one thing -- it was way too big for her to finish!",0,0,0

The omelette had grilled chicken, green chilies, enchilada sauce, cheese  and sour cream.    Came with crunchy potatoes.  

Stuffed French toast was filled with sausage, eggs, cheese and topped with powdered sugar.     Unique combination and it all worked.

 I ordered classic eggs Benedict, my fav breakfast choice. I was excited plus the potatoes versus hash browns. The potatoes had too much of that lawry seasoning...ugh. Then worse, my hollandaise sauce was the worst thing I have ever had! They didn't properly make the sauce and then to make it worse, the whole dish was slathered in it! I literally used a spoon to scoop out the sauce just so I could eat everything else which wasn't much better but I needed to eat.

Got to go last week and it was so good my mom wanted to eat there 2 days in a row! and my mom NEVER eats anywhere 2 days in a row.

highlights: giant portions, strong coffee, FAST SERVICE.

First day I ordered biscuits and gravy with potatoes and eggs. Was a little weirded out by the orange potatoes but when mixed with the gravy they were very good. The biscuits are freshly made and are amazing! Coffee was really good and strong here too.

I was very curious for the Cincy chili and got a side of that but I had to taste it and take it to go. It was AWESOME. Brought it home and ate it on a hot dog! AWESOME.

the service here was VERY fast and it was great but definitely hard for everywhere else we ate in Vegas to live up to.

lets see my other families food choices were all GIANT and everyone was really happy which is very unusual for us.

A couple of my friends and I split the blackened prime rib benedict (a must must MUST!), the strawberry cream-stuffed french toast (tasted like fair food), and an Italian omelette. Enormous portions priced right--felt so bad leaving so much of it uneaten, especially since it was so delish. Even the coffee was the absolute perfect diner coffee.

Now the review...

The family and I were in Vegas to cash in on a Giants World Series bet.  I really didn't want the usual buffet, so we did a quick search on Yelp and off to the Egg and I we went.  

We stepped in and were quickly seated.  The televisions on the wall was great.  I could see who was playing and not playing for that Sunday's Fantasy Football Lineups.  We ordered coffee and looked over the menu.  (Note- Coffee was ok.  Better than IHOP, but not my favorite blend.) 

We looked over the menu and what a selection!  It took us awhile to figure out what we wanted.  I ordered the Egg-Ceptional Omelet, my wife ordered the Two-egger, and my son had the Chocolate Waffles.    

The food quickly came out and as far as portions...  they were HUGE!  My wife's Two-egger was like 4 eggs.  My kid's waffles were shaped like Mickey Mouse, which was a nice touch.  My omelet was one of the biggest I've ever seen.  Our only problem was that the chocolate waffle was without chocolate.  We had them bring out some chocolate chips and all was well again.  

The omelet and ranch spiced potatoes were yummy.  You could taste freshness of the ingredients.  The omelet had sausage, diced ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes, portabella mushrooms and melted cheese all topped with sour cream and green onions.     

We finished all we could and off to gambling we went.",1,1,1

I got the Benedict's Garden, a vegetarian Eggs Benedict.  It came with English muffin halves on the bottom, then sliced grilled tomatoes, some avocado, and topped (the menu says smothered which is close) with Hollandaise.  There were potatoes and a side of some fresh fruit.  My friend got the Mexican omelette which was the special of the day.

Everything was really good.  My eggs and the mixture of avocado and tomato with the Hollandaise was quite good.  The breakfast potatoes were really flavorful and the small slice of canteloupe and fresh pineapple was like having a dessert at breakfast.

Today, I just wanted to give a couple of shot outs to Brady, the Assistant Manager, and to Jesus, whom I discovered is a 20-yr  employee of the Egg & I. 

Jesus is a busboy. On my last two visits prior to the one I'm writing about (this past Monday, Memorial Day), Jesus has asked me if I needed anything to let him know, which he did again on this visit. Jesus is ALWAYS willing to help, and has gotten me coffee, filled my coffee and even scored me an extra banana nut muffin or two before. Not really his job, as his is to clean tables and make sure their customers have somewhere nice to be seated, but Jesus ALWAYS goes above and beyond what is expected of him to do, and I appreciate his hard work.

Which brings me to Brady, the young Assistant Manager. Brady is definitely young enough to be my little brother. Brady is a genuine, bonafide talker. He shoots the shit with you, but real talk. Not fake talk like I'm only here to make it look like I care about you talk, but good ol' fashioned back and forth banter. He has a tattoo on one of his forearms that says ""Family First"", and Brady made me feel like family! While shooting it with him, I told him that we had just come from Laughlin but had to detour cause one of my wife's uncles fell ill and ended up in the hospital and guess what Brady did? He sent me home with a loaf of their bomb ass banana nut bread to take to my uncle at the hospital since I told him that's where we were heading after breakfast! THANK YOU AGAIN BRADY! I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR KINDNESS!

I'll end this review with a little bit about the food.........my Italiano skillet was on point, AS USUAL.

If I were looking for a reason to move to Las Vegas the Egg & I would be the reason.  Funny thing to say when speaking about a location that has something to offer for everyone and a few of the best dining experiences that money can buy. 

The Egg & I is simply a great place to enjoy breakfast and that's because it is simple.  Everyone who knows me knows that I love breakfast and can almost always be found at my favorite breakfast place in Corona, CA every Saturday morning without fail.

The Egg & I is a place that locals visit and has a lot of regulars.  It's located in a small strip mall that is way off the strip.    The interior is what you would expect in a diner that intended for locals.  It's a large open space with lots of tables and country-ish decorations on the walls

The menu is consists of many different egg dishes, pancakes, waffles and some incredible looking skillets.  On my first visit I tried the Works Omelet, which as you would expect has a list of ingredients including bacon, sausage, ham, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, mushrooms, cheese and sour cream.  It is served with Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes and a choice of toast or a house made banana nut muffin.    

The omelet was cooked to perfection.  It was served hot, light and fluffy. The cacophony of ingredients came together to form the perfect symphony of deliciousness.   My preference for breakfast potatoes is hash browns.  I love them!  The Habla Diablo potatoes were a treat and a nice departure from the hash brown rut I'd been in.  The high point of the meal was however was the banana nut muffin(s).   They serve one almost like an appetizer when sit down before you order.  You get a free one with a Yelp check in.   It told our waitress, Chance (awesome Las Vegas name) how much I liked them and she sent me home with a couple of extra.  Bless her!  I'm not a huge fan of bananas.  In fact I hate everything about them but the banana nut muffins here changed my mind.  It's worth a trip to Egg & I just for muffins.

To summarize, great food, fun local ambience, extremely friendly staff.  I'd repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat...",11,9,10

I will say that there are a few things this visit that I wasn't too pleased with though. I ordered a classic 2 egg breakfast with a side of salsa and unfortunately they changed the salsa.

It's not the same they use to make and I'm not sure why they did that. This new salsa they use is just down right yucky tasting.

I ordered their fresh vegetable (vegetarian) omelette with egg whites sans cheese with a side of potatoes. The omelette was pretty good, although nothing terribly mind-blowing and it came with spinach and mushrooms. The house potatoes were not my favorite, but still eatable.

I appreciate the choices in coffee creamers and the carafe being left of the table, which saves the hassle of tracking down a server for a refill when you've got a small cup o' joe. Good coffee, but I come here for the eggs. 

I ordered the hash, but our table also ordered a pancake plate and a waffle works. The waffles look light and crisp, the pancakes are fluffy and have a variety of fillings (but I think we got charged a different-than-base-price for these, so ask or watch out? Our server suggested something after we handed over the menus), and the crispy little home fried potatoes are so tasty! (I got a half serving of these, half serving of fruit--which is plenty of both!) My hash was homemade and nothing like that cubed canned corned beef hash, but it was pretty salty for my tastes. My eggs came out EGGsactly right and were mouthwateringly delicious for something so simple--eggs. My fiance asked for tomatoes in his scrambled eggs, and those were extra too, and we weren't informed of that\/how much until we saw it on the check (the pancake chocolate chips and the tomatoes somehow managed to be about $5, so I don't know how that stacks up, but it peeved me a bit).

If they ask you if you want toast or the banana muffin, DO NOT GET TOAST. GET THE DANG MUFFIN. It is sooooo good. It doesn't look like anything special, mostly because it's flat on top and served upside down, but it's soft and moist and tasty and warm and goodness gracious, so amazing. If you're counting calories, #1 you're in the wrong place, #2 put butter on it anyway.

The little eggy signs are so helpful for when you need to track down your server--a great idea instead of trying to get someone's attention in the (can be) noisy atmosphere. 

This place is fantastic, but I pulled a star because the server forgot a side order for half the meal and didn't notify us of the upcharges on the items at time of order and after suggesting (i.e. we order regular pancakes, he suggests blueberry or chocolate chip, but doesn't mention they cost extra) after taking the menus so we couldn't see ourselves. I know some things are extra, but how much sometimes influences people's decisions--knowing if it was $0.50 versus $2.00 would have made that difference, for example.

The menu is huge and a little overwhelming because there are so many options, but I finally settled on the Huevos Rancheros with carnitas, both sauces, and breakfast potatoes. I also used the Yelp check-in for a free banana nut muffin, and she kindly brought one for each of us at the table! The muffin is so moist--we're talking stick to your fingers moist. Our meal came relatively quickly and there was silence among the table as we all dug in. The huevos rancheros were probably among the best I've ever had. It came with so much carnitas and melted cheese--it was exactly what we needed after two days of Vegas, if you catch my drift. I was wary of the breakfast potatoes initally; I'm a hash browns girl precisely because breakfast potatoes are often underseasoned. Not the case here in the slightest. Each nugget was a little crispy, but soft on the inside and packed tons of flavor. The portions are huge though, so keep in mind when you're ordering! I split the huevos rancheros and it was more than enough for two!

My friend got the chocolate chip pancakes and they were also very delicious, but super thick and rich so not what my dehydrated body was in the mood for. Gimme dat salt!

So good the wife and I went two days in a row during a recent visit to Vegas. 

4 Star Breakdown from two days:

WAIT TIME: 4*
Day 1 : Long ( We were told 15min , and it ended up being over 30min wait.) 
Day 2 : Quick ( seated in about 5- 10 min. )


Food: AMAZING!!!! 5*


Service: 4* ( They have clever yellow \/ black eggs as signs that you need help)

Day 1 : Had a server by the name of Amanda, who ROCKED!!! She was the perfect      host, and made the experience great. (she gets 5 *+ )

Day 2: Never got the servers name( skinny preggo chick), she never came buy often, and when she did, she would completely forget about stuff we asked for. The guy next to us sat there for a good 20min before she took his drink order, and even longer to get him his meal. I had asked for a refill of water, and she seemed to bring water to everyone around us, except for me. The she abruptly brought us our bill that we had not asked for , while we were still eating, and didn't even ask if we wanted anything else. Oh yeah I still hadn't gotten my water, so I asked her again and finally as we were getting up to leave, she brought water.

think this was the original, they have a number of them in vegas now

buddy had the chicken enchilada omelette, which he said was pretty good
for some reason though, their hash browns are now patties, like you get at mcdonalds....no biggie, still looked good

I had the loco moco, which was good, not anything to write home about though
it was basic hamburger patty over rice with brown gravy and 2 sunny side up eggs on top....funny the waiter asked how I would like the eggs prepared, didn't know there was a choice with loco moco!  in retrospect, probably should have gone with standard breakfast fare or my go to key largo crepe
sometimes you shouldn't try new things
it wasn't bad, I just think their normal breakfast items are a lot better

noticed they have added quite a few southern\/Spanish dishes, maybe to cater to changing tastes? I will have to try next time...I know, stick with what you like, but have to let you guys know right?",2,2,2

We were sat immediately and there was no wait to receive drinks and menus. 
Our waitress was Chance and quite honestly one of the best servers I've had in a long time. She knew her menu and was open to giving suggestions. She was also VERY attentive and upbeat in general. during a pretty good breakfast rush, mind you!
Firstly, as I said before, it's busy. But you never have to flag down a waitress or ask when your order is coming. There's a little sign on the table which lets you flip between a happy egg and a frowny egg. If the frowny egg is showing, the waitress\/waiter is supposed to help you right away. I never had to use this sign because the service was so prompt. 
First thing I loved was the bottomless cup of coffee. You're given a full thermos pitcher of coffee all for your table and there's plenty of sugar (or substitutes) and cream at hand. 
I usually ask for a recommendation on what to order when traveling and Chance was eager to help. She told me about the Chile Relleno Benedict and said that it's not normally on the menu (special days only) but that it really was a must try. Honestly, I'm not huge on chile relleno but hey she seemed enthusiastic and I went ahead and ordered it. 
It was amazing. And it SHOULD be an everyday menu item. I'll go into both dishes and what was so awesome about them below. 
Chile Relleno Benedict:
Wow. The dish was amazing. Benedicts make just about anything better but this was no joke. REALLY well thought out and balanced. First thing I noticed was that the eggs were PERFECTLY poached. The whites were soft but not slimey or runny. There was zero cooked yoke. It was warm and ran smooth just the way god intended. 
I don't know what was breaded in the dish but it was either the Chile itself or the thinly sliced (and tender as all hell) chicken breast. The breading was really what made the dish I think. It added just enough saltiness that I didn't need to add salt or pepper to my breakfast. I always add salt and pepper (unless I get chicken fried steak) and that was a pleasant surprise. The chile and the chicken were topped off with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. There were home fries on the side which also needed no seasoning beside what was already there but honestly I would have been ok just eating the chile relleno benedict. It was really that good. 
My GF ordered the veggie pesto sandwich with Cajun fries. I didn't try the sandwich itself but she said the bread was very tender and the pesto was really tasty. I DID sneak a few fries however and loved them. Thinly cut shoestring style potatoes covered in seasoning. Another instance where salt was not necessary. Really they would have been fine without ketchup. 
I fully intend on visiting this place every time I head to Las Vegas and can't say enough good things about it. Thank you Chance for the awesome recommendation and thank you Egg & I for turning out exceptional food and service at a great price!",0,0,0

SERVICE:

It was prompt, friendly and out waitress was great. Coffee was brought to us right away after we asked for it. One pot of coffee.

THE FOOD:

We tried the the ham and cheese Omelet. Bacon, mushroom, sausage Omelet, Eggs Benedict and side order of corned beef hash. Omelet's come with your choice of bread or muffin. All orders came with their delicious cut potatoes. Food was tasty and flavorful. Omelet's were moist and the Benedict was wonderful with enough tangy  hollandise sauce.

I have never eaten at the same restaurant two days in a row. I only wish this restaurant we're closer to my house as I would be eating here every week. 
I am on a low-carb low-sugar diet. But I broke my diet to have their maple bacon French toast, twice!! It is so delicious it is better than a desert. We also ordered the chicken fried steak and chorizo scramble. Everything was delicious. We ordered their potatoes one morning and their fresh fruit the other. Their fresh fruit is wonderfully cut up slices of watermelon and pineapple and other melons. Not the yucky, cheap, cut up fruit that's been sitting there for days.
Their breakfast potatoes are all so delicious. The best way we can describe them is they are  very seasoned bite-size french fries. sooooo goood!
I guess it's a blessing in disguise The Egg & I is located in Las Vegas and we live in San Diego. I would definitely be gaining weight if this place were closer. Can't wait to go back to eat here. It's a couple miles from the strip that you will definitely enjoy your meal and save money.",0,0,0

We were seated quickly.  The service was ok. I don't know in what order the food went in or what, but this is what I noticed. 

There were 2 tables in front of my view.  One table got seated 5 minutes after us and the other table seemed like they were wating forever for their food.  I'm assuming the manager, went up to the table and apologized for their food not getting there yet.  I then noticed the table who sat down 5 mintues AFTER us got served their food first.  I looked at the hubby and said, ""how did that happen?"" AND they were served way BEFORE the table that was waiting.  So something happened to communication from the servers and the kitchen.   

I got the chicken fried steak.  When we got our food I was lovin' the potatoes!!  My scramble eggs were over cooked and hard - really no flavor.  My chicken fried steak was good, but the put sooo much gravy, I had to take half of it off.

From the outside, the place looks very unassuming. Not even busy. But right when we opened the door, crowds poured out, and we had to wait nearly 20 minutes for a table for two. The wall decor by the waiting place was cute. There were cartoons as well as sayings about eggs. Finally, we were led to our table by a super friendly and bubbly waitress.

The menu is printed like a newspaper - cool!! I've never seen that before!! (Yes I took a picture with it.) The selection is pretty extensive considering that every single item on the menu are made with eggs (like skillet items, omelettes, etc), so it took us a while to decide. I forget what we ended up getting - it was a while ago, pardon me - but I remember it being soooo good! They also customize your order so that you can have whole eggs vs egg substitutes vs egg whites, etc... Definitely get the fresh banana nut bread!! We almost got a loaf to take home back to LA even though we weren't leaving for LA yet.

The service was superb. Our waitress kept coming by to check up on us.

The hostess and waitress were both really pleasent. The waitress did a excellent job explaining the menu to me and letting me know how I could customize my order. Everything I asked for was promptly brought out.

While not the best sausage gravy I have had in Vegas, it was still decent on it's own and still better than most of the sausage gravy I have had in Vegas. Nice amount of sausage throughout with a nice homemade flavor. I do believe it was made in house. But it still had the consistency of being out of a packet. The biscuits weren't as soft and tender as I would have liked, but still passable.

The bacon I got was on point. They were straight and crispy. I asked for the eggs to be extra soft. They were okay, but it was weird, the top half of the pile was cooked how I wanted, but the bottom half was cooked hard. I'm  guessing they were left on too long and not continually scrambled.

The French toast on it's own without the strawberry madness was moist and fluffy; however, the strawberry filling along with the strawberry topping and the whip cream really overdid it. It was hard for me to finish.

The eggs and bacon were standard fare. Nothing to note. I tried some of my buddy's chicken fried steak. Again, decent seasoning, but tasted a bit too heavy for my liking.

Make sure that if you decide to come here that you use yelp and check in to get yourself a banana nut muffin.. The muffin was super light and moist and delicious.

There are so many different things to pick from on the menu.. The menu is super creative.. I got the breakfast burrito and it was the perfect size for my appetite.. The salsa for it was delicious too (I asked for extra).. I left full and ready for the day.

Located right off the strip, it's a great place to grab a bite to eat without hassling with the nearby hotels.  The prices are reasonable and they have a huge menu to choose from.  Even the pickiest of eaters have something to pick, no matter how difficult they might be.

It's a country style restaurant with a variety of egg dishes.  My favorite is the Eggs Benedict.  The hollandaise sauce is creamy and perfect and it's paired with some seasoned potatoes.  I like them, but they aren't my favorite.

Chicken Omelet (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=5jiBgyVg3dAhbE4X129pOw): I can't remember its name, but I do remember that it was absolutely tasty! Chicken, cheese, avocado with sour cream on top. Moist chicken. Fluffy omelet. Yum! 

Ranch Potatoes: Came with omelet. Addicting! Even though they were overly seasoned for my taste buds, I couldn't stop eating them.

Banana Nut Muffin (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=6JXT3ryRPelUwv5grDI67A): Came with omelet. Gigantic homemade muffin. Chewy top. Soft inside with bits of banana and nuts. So good!

Eggs Florentine (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=YvTvI5skrvIBBFC4W7TUVg): I didn't try it. But judging by its looks, I would imagine it to be delicious!

Coffee: Great quality coffee. It was unlimited refill and I had the whole carafe to myself. They have their own line of coffee. 

Huge portions!  We both packed half of our food to go. Great service! Friendly and attentive. And best of all, great prices! 2 breakfast entrees, 1 orange juice, 1 coffee, plus tax and tips all for $30! =D",18,14,13

The Egg & I seemed to have decent reviews, so we checked it out.  On the day we went, New Year's Eve morning, it was busy.  We had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated, which was fine.  

Looking at the menu, I quickly locked onto the biscuits & gravy meal (with eggs and potatoes).  I'm a complete sucker for this meal and decided to give it a try.  

When I ate my meal, I discovered the biscuits weren't homemade (and were crumbly) and the gravy was unremarkable.  You can't really screw up scrambled eggs.  The potatoes were wildly over seasoned and virtually unbearable to eat. 

I rate the Egg & I biscuits & gravy as a ""5"" (on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best I've ever had, which is at Arthur's Family Restaurant located in Orange, CA).

We had breakfast there twice over a recent trip to Vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. My first meal was the Ultimate Skillet. Bring a large appetite! My over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and all the ingredients were so tasty and fresh. I also enjoyed their sourdough toast. It was thick, flavorful, and buttery! The dish was so yummy and substantial.  It kept me going until late in the afternoon. My wife had the Bacon, Avocado, & Cheese omelette. She loved it. It was cooked to perfection; a uniform yellow color and cooked evenly through.  It was loaded with lots of avocado.  She said that it was maybe the best she's ever had. Wow!

I had to cut back on my next visit. I ate too much on the first one, although I really enjoyed it (trying to be good in Vegas???). I ordered the Eggs-Plus with ham. The scrambled eggs were cooked just right.  The ham was good. It was not dry, chewy or too salty. The potatoes were also good. The server helped my wife make substitutions to the Flapper which made her her happy. Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too? She rated the pancakes 5 stars!   Another great breakfast.

It's like what traditional egg benedicts dream to be some day basically.  Regular eggs benedict is Carlton Banks, Prime Rib Benny is Will Smith.  You get the picture.

Besides the entrÃ©e itself, my order of OJ was fresh squeezed and just right.  Their lemonade was great too, which is a definite plus in my book.  I also had a taste of their French fries and Portuguese sausage, which my cousins ordered and both were very tasty, too!  The fries were thin, crispy and flavorful.  While the Portuguese sausage was not overly oily and fatty and was cooked just right.

Service was verygood, as our waiter was attentive, friendly and always available.

The country potatoes are basically small fried potatoes squares with ranch seasoning.  My GF had the cajun shrimp eggs benedict special.

It's one of those bfast places where there are mugs on the table and the server brings you a giant pot of coffee and leaves it with you at your disposal.  There were different types of pre-packaged cream and sugars, including hot sauces, ketchup, and a little egg sign which you can flip over if you need servicing.  Not as ingenious as the button at Korean bbq places, but it works!

Most entrees come with a side of toast or homemade banana nut muffin.  I'm not a big fan of banana nut but my god, theirs is just divine. Spongey, soft, moist, slightly sweet and with just the perfect flavor of fresh banana flavor and a little hint of crunch from the nuts.  The nuts aren't bitter either, as some walnuts can be and it was just pure perfection.

BH and I went a little buckwild (as we always do) and we ordered three dishes: eggs benedict florentine, a half order of corned beef hash, and the stuffed french toast with eggs and bacon.  The benedict was awesome and was smothered in creamy hollandaise sauce.  The eggs were soft and runny but the English muffin was still crispy and chewy.  The stuffed french toast was pretty good.  BH gobbled up the entire plate whereas I had just a bite or two.  I thought there was too much egg and not enough bacon, but BH told me it was great with maple syrup.  I like sweet meats and breads, but I haven't gotten accustomed to sweet scrambled eggs yet, so I never tried it dipped in sticky sweet maple. Finally, the corned beef hash was very fresh and I could definitely tell it was homemade and not from a can.  The chunks of potato were creamy and starchy while the chunks of meat were flavorful, salty, and a little reminiscent of dog food (but in a good way).  The over easy egg on top made it even more delectable.

Finally, one of the best parts of the meal, besides the banana nut muffin, were their ranch potatoes.  They are roasted to a perfect crunch and seasoned with some sort of red powder - possibly paprika for a bit of smokiness?  They were so damn good, that even past my stuffing point, I kept stabbing at the potatoes so I could get every last bit in my mouth.  Needless to say, BH  and I were nearly bursting by the time we left Egg & I.  I call that a sign of good breakfast and a good start to a day.",0,0,0

I just happened by this place on a Saturday morning.  There was a 15-20 minute wait for a table, which can be an annoyance, or it can be an excellent endorsement for patience.  My wife had a four-egg multi-cheese omelette, and tiny as she is, she ate every bit, washing it down with coffee (that was attentively refilled!).  It came with choice of potatoes and a super-delicious muffin.  I had a specialty omelette that was filled with spicy veggies and cheese.  When it came time to kick the spuds to the side, the waitress offered fruit, tomatoes, or fruit and tomatoes!  The fruit was chosen, fresh, sliced, and nicely arranged.  I had the coffee too, and the waitress was never stingy when more creamers were requested.  Such good service.  I can see why this place has people waiting for a seat.

This place has the best egg-dish menu I've ever seen.  The price of most dishes is in the $10.00 or less range.

SO got the Mexican Omelette and she couldn't finish it because of the generous portion size, but she enjoyed what she was able to put away. We both enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice.  There's nothing like seeing some honest elbow greased pulp in your juice to let you know it's the real deal.

The day before my lady had found a voucher in a tourist magazine together with the notion of a review that this place (i.e. both) we're very liked with the community and the reviewers, in fact best liked.

Being a no brainer it turned up trumps in reality: The place was VERY busy (which we took as a good sign to start with) yet being seated only took a moment and the service was very fast and attentive. Food variety on the menue is almost too big ;-) so I quite took my time to decide. Got an italian influenced omelette which turned out to be very tasty. 
One more thing about the service: Our little boy didn't like his fries because they came spiced (paprika or the likes)... they were replaced with plain ones in no time - comped !

A little before the food arrived a nice and cheerful lady of the staff came over and chatted us up a bit. Her expert eye didn't fail to note that we were out-of-towners. Later, I found out that she was actually the manager (owner?) and had the same first name as my darling ! When she heard that I failed to order the banana nut muffin (house specialty) she had one sent to our table immediately - again, complementary !

Originally my friends and I wanted to eat at Peppermill for brunch before leaving Vegas but the wait for 6 people was over 40 minutes. Called in to check for the wait here and was happy enough to find that we would only have to wait for 20 minutes despite it being packed.

There isn't much space inside for customers to sit while waiting for their table; you'll most likely have to wait outside and that kind of sucks especially in the hot summer weather. When we got seated, we were promptly given the menu and starter drinks. Service here is on point. Karla, our server, went out of her way to make everything as easy as possible for us. Instead of having us go to the front ourselves to split our check, she went ahead and split it six ways for us. I LOVE YOU KARLA.

Food portion here is very generous. You definitely will get the bang for your buck because most of the food items costs $8-$12 and only one person in my group was able to finish his order. Whatever you order, make sure the potatoes are included or order it on the side! There's Cajun seasoning on it, I think, and it's amaaaazing. You won't regret coming here!

P.S. there's this cute egg centerpiece on your table. Instead of flagging a waitress\/waiter down, just flip it from its black side to the yellow side and someone will come to your table. How cool is that??",3,3,3

I had the bacon and avocado omelet, and my husband had the Cincy chili omelet, both with sides of potatoes (of course!). One of our friends ordered the Country Benny, and the other had an order of potatoes with a side of brown gravy. We all left pleased and sated, and my husband and I had leftovers as well!

Everything on the menu looks fantastic, but I suggest getting an egg dish (seeing how the name of the place is ""The Egg & I""!)

Service was what I expect from a half-decent diner - fast and punctual.  My waffle was not served with real maple syrup, which was a major bummer.  The potatoes that are included with the standard egg breakfast were small squares but were cooked perfectly and tasted a lot like French fries from Fuddruckers (heavy on the Thyme, which gives them a reddish, golden-brown color.) There's a little stand at the table with two metal egg badges. The first, in black, is a happy egg face which states to the wait staff that all is well.  The second is an egg-face in bright yellow with a somewhat consternated egg-face which signifies to the wait staff that you're either unhappy with the meal, but mostly tells them you need something.  I was in a particularly crappy mood, so I kept flipping the egg-face to the bright yellow unhappy egg-face, and the waitress was getting perturbed with me.

It seemed to be really busy with lots of people waiting outside (on a Sunday afternoon), but we luckily only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated.  

Our server was super nice.  She really helped elevate the entire experience.  When we asked for banana nut muffins to go with our entrees, she asked if it was our first time there.  We told her yes and she said the muffins were free for first timers!  Hope that's true and I'm not getting anyone in trouble by posting that info here.  

I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine & it came with those little (obviously frozen) and highly seasoned potatoes.  Overall I enjoyed the dish, but there was so much Hollandaise sauce that the English muffin got pretty soggy and the ham was really quite bad.  It was cut in thick slices and was very rubbery.  It almost tasted canned or something.  I took the ham off and it was much better that way.  However, the whole thing was a runny, saucy mess.  The poached eggs were cooked perfectly though.  My sister unfortunately didn't enjoy her blueberry pancakes too much.  This might sound strange, but they were way too fluffy for both of us & just didn't taste that great.  We both loved the muffins though.  That very well may have been the best part of the whole meal.

If they know winters are on the cold side in Las Vegas, not sure why they don't invest some money  get a few of them.

I ordered the Crazy chicken omelette ($11) and it added up to my non enjoyable experience. It was flavorless, and the chicken and mushrooms were inexistent. 
Overload of flavorless cheese on top of my omelette. 
The habla Diablo fries were pretty good.

The banana muffin was the best part of my . It was warm when it came out and got a second one as I checked in in yelp!

Whenever we are in Vegas we try to eat off the strip. We were heading out of town and this place hit the spot.

Just a little diner type place (nothing fancy) but the servie was friendly and the food YUMMY!

The menu is HUGE.

We sampled the pancakes, waffle, eggs and home fries.

We ordered a side of Diabla sauce, which came warm and was the perfect compliment. Our omelettes were moist, perfectly cooked, and stuffed with fresh ingredients.

Hence I visited the Egg & I.  And it was closed.  Computers Down. :(

When I was finally able to return I looked through my newspaper style menu and was torn between the biscuits and gravy or a omelet.

I tried the artichoke omelet and sub'd for some mushrooms.  I love the fetta cheese on top and the fresh tomatoes.  One thing that lacked... I couldn't taste the artichoke... and it could probably use more mushrooms.  It was a great idea however probably would taste better with bacon and mushrooms or ham or something to that effect... Something you can actually taste.  The potatoes were really good, home fries... and more of a fries taste since they had a TON of seasoning on it.  I would prefer less seasoning, and have a bottle to the side if you want more.

Servers were very nice, there was a line of people waiting to be seated.  It was a good experience, I think I like Blueberry Hill more, but I wouldn't be opposed to returning here again.",7,3,6

1. We came in around 10:45-11 and waited for about 15 minutes so I would say any later and you'll probably be waiting 30+ minutes..It started getting pretty busy right after we put our name down. 

2. If you are waiting in line, check out their menu cause they have a LOT of choices. 

3. Wear a sweater\/sweatshirt - I know were in Vegas but the place was blasting the AC. Even our waitress had a sweatshirt on. 

4. Order a banana bread muffin, its moist and fresh and a great snack. I ordered one after our meal because I was stuffed from my plate 

5. If you know you can't eat a whole plate of food, get the HALF order. Of course our waitress told us AFTER we finished. 

6. The pancakes were the best part of my meal - order them! Only complaint was that they served it with that fake syrup. (I'm from the East coast, I'm a little spoiled)

7. My sister didn't really care for the cinnamon toast french toast - they didn't look that great either

It was a solid breakfast for a lazy morning, I think next time I would try one of their egg-dishes since they are called Egg & I

The service and offerings here are top shelf, you're met with kindness and courtesy that accompanies a moist, warm banana muffin. 

I gotta say, because our banana nut muffins were so good.... we ordered a banana nut loaf to go. It didn't last long after we arrived back in SoCal. :)

ok, for reals tho - 

the GRUB:
- check out my pics, my wife got the stuffed french toast with eggs and bacon, french toast, powdered sugar, and maple syrup - like the kitchen sink of breakfasts all in one bite... pretty good.
- also pictured, i got the Prime Rib Benny - ala the meaty blackened spice prime rib, poached eggs, holandaise sauce, on top of an open faced buttered croissant like a traditional eggs benedict - but kicked upped... super filling and super delicious
- fresh squeezed OJ and hot cups of Joe

the JOINT:
- typical vegas locals crowd, a little bit of everyone
- old school decor on the inside (like a country kitchen)
- outside patio seating if not a scorcher of a desert day
- they had an LCD with local sports and AC too

the SQUEEZE:
- breakfasts are always too expensive to me, so im a little jaded... but anyways, those 2 dishes and fresh squeezed OJ = approx $50 after tax and tip
- friendly wait staff and hostess
- plenty of parking in the strip mall
- vegas blvd (the strip) close

FINAL SAY:
pretty good change up for breakfast, if youre starting to get tired of those casino buffet champagne brunches\/breakfasts...",2,2,2

I will say - my coworker and I were in Las Vegas for work.  It was a Friday, around noon and we had finished with our client earlier than expected. We did a Google search to see what was available close by for food as neither of us had a chance to have a real breakfast that morning.  After scrolling past several chains I landed on a name that wasn't familiar and highly rated - Egg & I.  I was later a little bummed to discover that Egg & I is in fact a chain, as I had hoped it was local to the area (I was unfamiliar with it being from the Northeast\/Mid-Atlantic region and never encountering one before).  I will tell you though - I did not regret choosing this place for a late breakfast\/early lunch.

When we pulled up the place was hopping.  A good sign that we picked a good place.  Inside there appeared to be a mix of both tourists and locals.  Although they were busy, we were seated very quickly.  Every plate I passed on the way to the table had breakfast food on it, and it all looked and smelled amazing.

The menu was quite extensive... what you would typically find in a diner.  The omelettes and breakfast skillets sounded especially appealing, and come to find out are their most popular choices.

Our waitress was attentive and very helpful in providing menu suggestions.  When she found out it was our first time there, she insisted on bringing us fresh banana nut muffins - which was a great touch!

The muffins were divine - served warm, they were thick and rich.  Like a really good banana bread in muffin form.

I chose to get an egg white omelette with mushrooms, spinach, artichokes and cheese.  It came cooked perfectly and I liked that the cheese was smothered on top and not actually in the omelette.  It was a nice twist.  The breakfast potatoes served on the side were also cooked perfectly - crisp (and not greasy!) on the outside, soft on the inside and seasoned with a signature mix of spices.  Based on what I've seen online, most other locations do seasoned ranch potatoes.  I liked the Vegas location's spicier take!  It had a kick, but wasn't too spicy.  I liked the blend of seasoning so much, I purchased a bottle to take home with me.

My coworker ordered a skillet and raved about how delicious it was!  

Even though the place is a chain, they must be locally franchised and I really liked how the Vegas location had the feeling of a locally owned place.  

Great food, great people and it was less than 15 minutes from the Strip and airport.  I'd definitely take the trek out for a meal or two on my next Vegas trip.",0,0,0

I had their breakfast burrito (scraped out of its tortilla -no gluten for me ). It was very good. In retrospect I would just get a skillet but I was starving and not thinking clearly with all the choices!

He ordered EGGS BENEDICT.  It was served in a baking dish so I guess the restaurant feel compelled to fill it with sauce.  It was completely drenched in ""Hollandaise"" if you could even call it that.  It was creamy and yellow, yes.  But there was no butter taste, or lemon.  Moreover, the slice of ham on the benedict was so thick and strong flavored that it was the predominant flavor.  

I ordered the HAM AND MUSHROOM SKILLET with TWO EGGS OVER EASY.

FYI: the Ranch Potatoes are diced taters completely drenched in Lawry's seasoned salt and they use it anywhere potatoes might be needed.  The result is ..seasoned salt EVERYWHERE!

While I don't consider most of the menu items to be healthy, as is typical of many American breakfast diners, you are given the option to make your order healthier, whether it be by using egg whites only, no cooking oil, etc. There are also SO MANY menu items to choose from.

The location is about 2 miles away from the Hilton Grand Vacation Suites, which is where we stay always, great location right off of Sahara Ave. The decor is super cute, a bit country, yet not overwhelming and suffocating. There is an outdoor dining patio, it does face the busy street, but it was quiet. Surprisingly.

The food is great, fresh, came out hot and the coffee is good. A great variety of breakfast and lunch items, and I am looking forward to going back because as i said, slow service but great food. Good tasting. Fair prices. Liked this joint

Gave the 3 stars for the poor service and time we spent there despite non busy employees piddling around.

Anyway gotta eat breakfast so we came here.  Typical breakfast shop.  I ordered the Fiesta Skillet which was a layer of their ranch potatoes topped with a mixture of green chilies, onions, and salsa.  On top of that was a layer of melted cheese and two eggs over-easy.  The skillet was accompanied by two slices of wheat toast and two slices of fruit.  It was pretty tasty.  I really like the ranch potatoes, eggs were cooked correctly, no brown spots and yolks were runny.

There were three different types of Habla Diablo sauce on the table Original, Chipotle, and Verde.  So if you need a little spice in your breakfast you can choose your pain.  Well not really since none of them are that spicy.

It's a Sunday morning so we came into it assuming we would be waiting at least 30+ minutes. Although it was packed we probably only waited between 15-20 minutes. For breakfast on a Sunday morning that's really not bad.

We got seated on the patio which is what we wanted at the time but honestly we froze to death. If you're eating breakfast before 11AM sit inside or wear like ten sweaters.

We both ordered omelettes. I had the mashed potato Omelette and my friend had the bacon and avocado omelette.

I planned to head back to socal early this morning and wanted to be the first one in the restaurant. I arrived at around 5:45 am and fidgeted in my rental car while checking the ""closed sign."" Suddenly another car pulled up next to me, the driver walked out and headed straight into the restaurant - the sign was magically on Open. Wtf... 

The hostess\/waitress was so friendly (and at the buttcrack of dawn thats pretty impressive) that I think this partly made me enjoy not only the food but much of the rest of my day.

The front lobby is decorated with articles and reviews AND pictures of eggs in action shots which I found pretty amusing (sometimes it doesnt take much) but the main eating area is pretty diner-y so I kind of zoned out till the food arrived. Ordered the fender bender egg crepe with avocado and sprouts and something else in it and it came out surrounded by a mountain of delicious seasoned potatoes and the softest, freshest muffin i've ever had. The egg crepe is in a league of its own compared with any kind of omelet you can get at IHOP or denny's or some drive by diner. 

I sat there for a good half hour savoring the meal. At the end it was all gone - the muffin, potatoes, egg crepe and the bucket of coffee. For the amount of food I had, it was very very light and felt quite healthy. I didn't get hit by the food coma train on the way home which is a big plus.

As a heavy consumer of all things chicken, I recommend this place to everyone. Unless you don't have taste buds...then go to your local diner where your $4.99 omelet brings you to orgasm every sunday morning. If you have taste buds - go eat here. Pay a little extra. Its worth it. I would guess that this is the best ""cheap"" breakfast i've ever had.",1,0,1

My gf & I had breakfast around 11am. It was really crowded but there was only a 10 minute wait.

We ordered the croissant sandwich, I had mines with turkey sausage and fruits and she had hers with bacon and potatoes. 

Service was great, food came out fast. Casual dining, indoor\/outdoor seating, private lot. meal for 2 cost around $26.

We went on a Sunday morning, for a lazy brunch and that's exactly what it was. 

The menu options are EXTENSIVE. Lots of sweet and savory options. We ordered the Brad's Scramble and Waffle with a banana nut muffin on the side. I'd read tons of reviews about the muffin so I wanted to know what the hype was all about. 

And I was BLOWN AWAY. This is one of the yummiest, tastiest muffins I've had in my life. And this set the bar really, really high for me. 

Then the waffle - with a nice layer of whipped cream and blueberries was perfect. 

Scrambled eggs were great as well. The potatoes were really excellent! Cooked perfectly and coated with the Hablo Diabla spice, not too spicy - just right. 

When we went to settle the check, there was a mixup and they charged us with someone else's bill. But they handled the situation well, and fixed the goof up very humbly. 

The staff was always nice and sweet. 

This is in stark comparison to the fancier places we dined over the weekend, where the staff was very curt and hostile at best.

Amanda was incredible! She was polite, friendly, and fast without being pushy! She encouraged us to take our time and when we were not quite sure what to order she offered recommendations which we definitely took and did not regret! The cinnamon roll and banana muffin were also DELICIOUS! 

An elderly impatient man sat himself behind us and after only a minute of being sat was incredibly rude and calling out for a waitress and coffee (despite not waiting to be sat by the hostesses). Amanda was calm and very polite when she greeted him which I can tell you, takes a lot when you aren't being treated with respect!

Egg & I is a casual breakfast joint, offering warm hospitality, home-like atmosphere and American faves food, making it a great place for enjoying a laid back meals. We decided to pay a visit to this happening place on weekend at around 11 a.m., and it was packed! The wait was tediously long, but it was so worth it; as they really live up to the hype by offering an extensive menu of breakfast goods at an affordable prices. 

For breakfast, it's egg benedict all the way for me! Ordered their Blackened Prime Rib Benny:  buttery slabs of croissants underneath tender, juicy prime ribs, topped with sautÃ©ed vegetables and hollandaise sauce. Nothing on this plate disappoints me! Nothing! All of them were superb, I personally love their habla diablo potatoes, it was crunchy and seasoned perfectly. The price for my breakfast is about $14; which is more than reasonable, especially if you witness the portion...

And if huge pan of egg benedict and half a plate of yummy potato goodness is not enough... wait for it.. They give you even more. As an offer for Yelp check-in, they generously gave us four of their famous banana muffins.  IT IS TO DIE FOR!!

Overall, if simple ambiance and BIG (tasty) breakfast experience is your cup of tea, Egg & I definitely will not disappoint. What a delicious find and happy to recommend this spot to you :)",39,32,36

I got the vegetable omelette, good amount of 4 eggs, had spinach, mushroom, bell pepper and probably onion.  Nothing fragrant that stood out, but it did the trick.  The meal came with plateful of mini squared potatoes.  At first glance, you can see all the seasoning and it taste over seasoned. My only gripe, was they had MSG sprinkled all over it.  I didn't realize it until my thirst level started to slowly creep up.  I took another close look and felt sick to my stomach.  Why, do you need MSG in fried potatoes? Why?

To end on a good note, I really enjoyed my slice of grapefruit and honeydew and opted not to order the muffin or toast.

First, we had this great server... Thaynara... She was sweet, understanding, and smart! She has patience while we figured out what we wanted to eat, so many choices!  YOU HAVE TO SEND HER TO SEE MICKEY!!!!!!!
Since we were 3, two of us decided to split the Works Veggie Benny... and Pumpkin Pancakes.. and the third party got the Chili Rellenos. 
Everything was really good.. I always hesitate to get poached eggs since so many restaurants make them in advance and have them sitting in a water bath, so in the end either you get a medium to hard yolk or a watery mess.. these were perfect, the minute you cut into them the yolk spread everywhere, the spinach and avocado were raw not cooked to death and I just can't believe the potatoes.. They were spiced and hot and really good, and we had a  choice of potatoes or fruit and since we couldn't decided Thay suggested 1\/2 and 1\/2.. Perfect. 
The pumpkin pancakes were moist (which I didn't expect, usually they are dry dry dry) but they were really good, like a good pumpkin cake (not pie).. 
And the Rellenos were really good, not too much cheese (which I don't like) and he really enjoyed them.
All in all a really good meal! 
It's 3PM and I'm still not hungry..
Oh, and we tried the Banana Muffins.. we gobbled them up! 
Even the coffee was OK.. 
Definitely, will be heading back for more!",1,1,1

We come here for breakfast every year each time we come to Vegas. Now I can tell more about the dishes I've tried at this place. I even got a sweat shirt from here that I wear regularly to the gym in NY LOL. Cute shirt just like the logo. Hubby said that you need your ID to pay at the cashier (if you use your card). The service is one of the best in Vegas. They're fast without rushing you, courteous without over do it, polite and happy naturally. Never had one bad experience. Everything on the menu comes with eggs, what do you expect at ""Egg & I""? They come with eggs but not with ""U"" of course, we don't eat people. The potato is amazing! I don't like potato but I like this type. It's diced-potato with tasty spice or could be just salt but very tasty. I don't eat much salt but I don't feel that it's salty, just tasty. I've tried different types of omelettes here and thought they're pretty big. Of all the omelette that I ordered so far, I liked Works Vege Omelette and Traditional Omelette. Not a big fan of Chili omelette. Last visit I had just the classic 2 Sunnyside up with toasted English muffin. Had something like this with multigrain before and fruit plate but this time I had it with cottage cheese. Hubby had eggs with potato but usually he would order it with bacon or ham too but I begged hubby to get something without meat for breakfast this time. Whatever you order here is great. I've tried many and highly recommended! Coffee is ok not so much on the ""wow"" side but they give you a pot for a table, so drink up your caffeine and then go play and win a jackpot!",0,0,0

Honestly the food here was a pretty big disappointment. For some reason the food here was very very salty--the ham, the sauce, everything. Eating this makes me feel super gross and pretty terrible about myself. Especially because the portion sizes here are HUGE!

We dined on a Friday morning around 11 and there was a wait of about 15 minutes.  The menu is cute and read likes a newspaper. 

The portions are huge and we split 3 dishes between the 4 of us. 

Catherine's Scramble: chicken, mushrooms, spinach, feta and artichokes.  I was sold on all the ingredients and the dish was amazing and flavorful.

Bacon, avocado and cheese omelette: full of bacon flavor and packed with avocados.  Usually when I get avocado with my omelette it is served sparingly with just a few pieces on top.  They were not stingy with it and filled it completely.

Corned beef hash: the good stuff, not canned corn beef.  Eggs and toast were included.

All the dishes were served with a side of ranch potatoes, which is amazing in itself.  I would eat the potatoes alone!

 Priced well with large portions.  I will definitely be back to try other dishes.

What a gem to have in Las Vegas, definitely one of the best breakfast spots I've ever had. After looking up a few places, ie. Denny's, Hash House a Go Go, we decided to come here even though it's off the strip. We took a Lyft from Venetian and the ride was only $11. 

With a party of 10, we thought that the wait would be around an hour, hour and a half, but amazingly, it was only thirty minutes. If you are coming here though, expect a long wait, so be patient, but it's worth the wait! Once we got seated, they handed us menus which looks like a daily newspaper. Deciding what to eat here was probably one of the hardest decisions I've had to make since there are 8 pages of food to read. Took a while but I finally decided on the Santa Cruz Skillet. 

Santa Cruz Skillet: The order came with toast and butter (since I got the muffin with the check-in) and sunny-side up eggs. The potatoes, chorizo, Santa Cruz sauce and the runny yolk was probably the best breakfast you could ask for after a night of drinking. Portion-wise, you could easily share this with another person but I was able to finish it on my own. 

Service was amazing throughout the meal, they have a system where you flip the happy egg to a sad egg whenever you need something, genius! I would have subtracted a star for them bringing out the 2 Bloody Mary's and Michelada after we almost finished the food, but they didn't charge us for the drinks in the end. On top of that, 7 of us checked-in for the free Banana Nut Muffin. I can't stress this enough, don't forget to check in! Will be back here for sure to try the other items on the menu.

All the portions sizes are huge and I liked how I could easily substitute items that were orginally in the veggie good omelette to make my order just the way I like it.  Great prices for what you are getting as well.  The atmosphere is also fun and filled with egg puns!  Egg-static!",0,0,0

Our food, however, was not. The server said our potatoes were fresh, but they didn't taste nor look fresh. They put wayyyy too much cheese on everything and it completely covered up the taste of everything else. So we decided to give it another try.
Came back on a Saturday morning, had the banana nut muffin that tasted stale, again, way too much cheese and our food took forever! I don't know why I thought this place would use fresher ingredients... Definitely disappointing.",4,2,2

Orange juice and coffee to drown it all down.  The only thing I would say is the lack of service hospitality.

And I usually like my breakfasts to be big, home style, and comfortable. So on my last trip to Vegas, rather than brave the elements of the casino buffet, I decided to get in my car and venture around the city and hit up some of the local spots.

Of course, I hit up Yelp to find out what the breakfast scene was in Las Vegas, and it led me to The Egg & I. This place is located in a strip mall, and has really really good parking. But that's just the small stuff, let's get into the real treasure within.

Right off the bat, you feel totally at home in this place. It's got all the elements of one of those quaint little hometown diners that you know and love and probably grew up with. The staff there is super attentive, and honestly made me feel so welcome as soon as I walked into the door.

 I didn't have to wait long at all for someone to come up to my table and asked me what I want to drink. As I slipped on my coffee and looked at the menu, they had a wide variety of stuff to choose from. I settled on the combo plate which had two pancakes scrambled eggs and my choice of sausage, bacon, or sausage patties. I went for the link sausage, because they said that was absolutely the hot ticket. And of course, long-time readers of my Yelp reviews will know that I always order a glass of milk with breakfast as a test for the server's attention to detail.

My breakfast was delivered by a different server and was sat down in front of me and for a brief second I thought I was going to have to make a mental note to give them one star off for forgetting my milk. When lo and behold two seconds later comes my waitress with a glass of milk. Great save on their part!

The food itself was really good the pancakes were light and fluffy, the eggs were cooked to perfection, and they were absolutely right on those link sausages ... they were the bomb diggity. The staff was really good about cruising by every once in a while and refilling my coffee and asking how things were without being overbearing. Honestly, it  felt like I was at a friend's house rather than a restaurant.

The bottom line? If you are ever out in Vegas and don't want to have to navigate through a horde of drunk people, obnoxious teenagers, or Keno players to get to your breakfast, you really have to go to The Egg & I. You won't regret it!",0,0,0

It's off the strip

Pros. 

Food is great. I have paid triple for similar food. And I had the cabo breakfast burrito which is and easy item to mess up. Sause was dryer and baked on so it did not cause the burrito to become soggy. Was crisp without too much grease. 

Great customer service.

Don't get me wrong, those are good. However, if you are looking for something a little off the beaten path for the BEST spot for breakfast in Las Vegas, look no further because the ""Egg and I"" will have you covered. With an astounding 2,500 reviews (as of October), its no wonder why this place has near-perfect Yelp reviews. 

I've actually had this place bookmarked forever as I finally got the opportunity to dine here with my lady on the morning of Saturday 9\/30\/17. Located directly on West Sahara Ave. (and adjacent to Arville St.), Egg and I is located in the Westside neighborhood of Las Vegas and only about a 10 minute drive from the Strip. Parking especially during breakfast hours can be very challenging as there are other business here. But the majority of people the park in this lot dine here.

Since we had arrived around 10:45am, we park quite a distance from the main entrance. The exterior is very rustic and looks like your mom & pop place. The interior has a very cozy and charming feel to it. Since the weather was a perfect 76Â°, we decided on dining at their generous outdoor patio. Since I was still tired (after not crashing until 3:30am and waking up at 7:30am), I ordered coffee. What is nice is that they give me the entire carafe of coffee! And lots of liquid creamers to go with it. Score! And our server was very sweet, attentive, and took care of us in a timely manner.

Their menu is very extensive; they have a huge variety of Eggs Benedicts, omelettes, corned beef hash, French toast, pancakes, waffles, and crepes. I finally decide on ordering their ""Bacon & Onion Skillet"" (for $9.99). My lady opted for ""The Classic"" which are two-eggs (she chose over easy) w\/toast and Godshall's turkey bacon. Both of us receive their signature Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. Even though business was at full capacity, both our breakfast platters arrive in just 10 minutes.

I've got to say, I was very impressed with what I received. There is something magical about these potatoes because the seasoning in them was addictive! And the bed of eggs over the ooey-gooey cheese made every savory bite a heavenly experience. I had the opportunity of trying some of her turkey bacon and damn, this was flavorful and on point! For the price you pay, you will get enough food to carry you through the rest of the day. In fact, my next meal wasn't until around 8 hours later at 7:30pm.

A little added bonus, if you check-in on the Yelp app, they will give you their signature Banana Nut Muffin. However, we got so much food that even more carbohydrates with that muffin would equal a massive food coma. Overall, the ""Egg and I"" is definitely a place worth checking out. A great family-owned experience, quality food, excellent prices, and stellar service makes this one of the easiest five-star ratings I've given in quite some time!",6,2,4

 Now that Yelp has opened my eyes, we've tried different places.  The Egg & I is one of our favorites for breakfast (actually brunch since we don't leave the hotel until 10 a.m. or so).  We eat here most often because there is a plethora of different items on their menu to choose from and they are ALL GOOD!  Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat when I'm away from home, so this is important to me.

To be honest it is pretty difficult to screw up a basic breakfast centered on eggs and breakfast meat.  However, the Egg & I is head and shoulders above the others with various delicious potato and egg treatments, their muffins, and friendly service staff.  Needless to say, we don't eat in hotel coffee shops anymore.  Not only do you get huge quantities of food at the Egg & I, it all tastes great, and what a variety!  If you're not into eggs, they also have waffles, pancakes and french toast, as well as salads and sandwiches.  Also free wifi so you can catch up on news from home & messages while eating.

If you are like my wife and insist on staying in a big-name Strip resort hotel, do yourself a favor and drive a short distance off the strip to have breakfast and some really tasty food.  Catch a glimpse of what the rest of the City of Las Vegas looks like, and taste real food, not the bland stuff the corporate chains dish out.  You might realize, like I did, that The Strip is not the final destination of your trip to Vegas.

There are fine dinner restaurants off the Strip as well!  Yelp is here for you.",0,0,0

- Egg's benedict: flavor explosion in my mouth!  I was recently introduced to the benny and can't believe what I've been missing out on. There are so many sensational flavors in this dish that you just have to try it for yourself!  And those potatoes - I'm not much of a potato breakfast person but could not help stealing these off my friend's plate!

- Strawberry stuffed french toast: I am more of a 'sweets' type of breakfast girl so I typically order french toast. You get 2 slices of toast stuffed with strawberry cream cheese goodness.  Unfortunately, this dish starts to become a little TOO sweet at the end so it's a struggle to finish the last few bites.  (I've had to confirm this by ordering this dish twice.)  If you can share this dish with someone, that'd work out well.

- banana bread muffins: you pretty much have to try this when you go there. I'm so confused because sometimes, I've been given the muffin for free and other times I've had to order it...but whatevs, you gotta do what you gotta do!  The muffin is soft and when served warm = bomb-dot-com.

** ALSO, must note on the service. All the workers are very polite and friendly. If you ever need something, they have this egg face you can turn over at your table. When the egg is black, you're fine.  Need something? Then turn the egg over so it's yellow. I have to say, this system totally works. Because the few times we've need a coffee refill or something..flip over the egg face and *BAM* someone helps you out right away!

It's a nice change-of-pace versus the Strip and a mere ten minute drive but not worth the added expense if you plan on cabbing.

Prices are reasonable, service is shoddy, and luckily one cannot mess up eggs.  Food wasn't greasy for whatever's thats worth.

As you may have guessed menu is egg-centric but fear not.  I decided to change things up during my latest visit and ordered hawaiian food.  Yep, you read that right and my internal organs as of a week later remain intact.  They offer: loco moco, spam and eggs and portuguese sausage and eggs.

Our server was also super sweet and constantly checked on us while even offering everyone in the table a free banana nut muffin. I did claim the Yelp check-in for the free muffin, but she was kind enough to just give everyone in our table one. What was even more wonderful was that one of our party members is allergic to nuts, so they gave her a blueberry muffin in replacement.

For food, I ordered the Chicken, Mushroom, and Spinach Skillet with sourdough toast ($10.25). I also shared with the boyfriend as he got the Stuffed French Toast ($9.75). When you're ordering here, I know your eyes are going to speak louder than your stomach, but I can guarantee that you'll be stuffed by the end of the meal. I highly recommend the Stuffed French Toast. It was the perfect blend of savory and sweet with a sausage, cheese and egg mixture folded between french toast. The syrup it comes with is lightly sweet and simply tastes amazing altogether. Of course, you'll end up a little sticky but it's worth the battle. Their potatoes are no ordinary potatoes either. They give you a plate full of potatoes covered with cajun seasoning --so delicious! Not to forget the skillet I ordered, because that was very tasty as well. They melted so much cheese over my potatoes, which was my favorite part. I only had 1\/4 of the skillet and was too full to continue.

A normal trip to Vegas for me and my girlfriend tends to be limited to the strip, but having driven out from San Diego, we decided to venture away from the concrete jungle for breakfast.  I looked on yelp, found this place and we started driving.

Here's all you need to know:

1. There were a lot of people waiting outside, and we almost just left.  For a two-top, we waited 20 minutes (which seemed more than reasonable for a Saturday morning).
2. The food came WICKED-FAST.  Like, 5 minutes MAX.  2 orders of eggs bene and a plate of pancakes.  CRAZY FAST.
3. I am an eggs benedict officianado, and theirs was MAGNIFICENT.  The eggs benedict was probably the best I've ever had, and the ""ranch-style"" potatoes that accompanied it were fantastic as well.
4. The prices were very reasonable.

100% Guaranteed that I will come back to this place next time I'm in Vegas.

RANDOM NOTE:  After picking up our pup from a doggy hotel near the airport, we considered driving way back to this place for breakfast one more time.

Drinks came out quick. The banana nut muffin that came with our meal came out as well and it was so delish!!! My daughter and I got one each and we saved one for later. We didn't want to get full so we shared one. 
Our food came out. I had the corn beef hash with the side of potatoes. Potatoes were good. I don't know why I got the corn beef. I'm not really a fan of it but it got a lot of reviews. My daughter ate half of her omelette and saw a hair in it. We bothered one of the servers about it and she took it back and made my daughter a half order of the same omelette. Almost done with our meal, they forgot to t bring out the banana pancakes my bro ordered. We reminded them about it too. 
The lady that took back the omelette came out with a complimentary plate of these banana bread with custard filling goodness. She probably gave it to us because of my daughters omelette and forgetting the pancakes on time. Omg! It melts in your mouth!! 
I love this place and they have the best customer service. Especially when it's crazy busy in there. When they brought out the pancakes, they told us they did not charge us for the omelette and pancakes. How awesome is that?? 
They're super nice! Thank you Amanda! I'll definitely go back but not order the corn hash for me.",1,0,0

We arrived at about 11 for a late breakfast and the place was packed. Which is typically a good sign, but it looked borderline at capacity. Moving on, we opted to sit on the patio and it was a great choice! They had misters that added a great touch and I enjoyed people watching! Only tip would be if you don't like pets don't come out here. It's a pet friendly area and in addition to a few dogs Mother Nature's pets attended... there was a fair amount of pigeons. Almost unsanitary because they'd get really close and flap off leaving all sorts of pigeon germs in the air. The restaurant can consider enclosing the area with that garden wood or something that would keep it a bit more sanitary. 

Moving on to the food. I felt first off there's way too much going on with the menu. Pictures, eggs , burritos, omelettes, chili, pancakes, and everything is served a thousand ways! I was overwhelmed. Thankfully my baby just learned to read and knew he wanted waffles! I on the other hand ordered half a bacon and avocado omelette and a side of corned beef hash! 

At best, the food was ok. The omelette was well cooked but the amount of avocado was overwhelming, a shock because usually you don't receive enough. The bacon was non existent because of the overwhelming avocado. The hash was mushy. I'd read it in another review and thought impossible, but the flavor was good, but the texture was similar to that of fried stringy mashed potatoes.

I don't think this place is as good as the reviews lead it to be... the place was packed when I went though, around 11am. It took about 30 minutes or so for a table. Looking at the menu, LOTS of stuff looked good and I had trouble deciding what to eat. The menu is a newpaper, which is actually really cute and different; also, there is a lot of word-play on the menu which I thought was cleaver. I ended up getting the chicken fried steak skillet and my brother got the carnitas skillet. Both did taste good, but I did not think it was spectacular. Portions were a good size, a bit larger than average. My chicken steak was tender and crispy and the gravy was good... but the house potatoes it came with was way too salty. I mixed everything together to try to lessen the salt taste, but in the end, I couldn't finish all the potatoes because, well, it was just too much salt. I think they need to put less of the seasoned salt on it. I'm a total potato lover and I couldn't finish my potatoes. My skillet also came with 2 eggs, anyway you want and a muffin or toast. I chose the muffin. It was good-average. I tried a bit of the carnitas skillet... but I'm not a big Mexican food fan... so it wasn't to my liking really, but my brother liked it. His did not come with a muffin or toast though. I also ordered coffee, thinking it was going to come in the interesting cup I see posted... it came in the ugly typical diner coffee cup...

Personally, I think Hash House A Go-Go has much better food and better prices... and way bigger portions!! My brother agrees with me too. 

I don't think this place is worth the wait... it didn't stand out in my mind. Just an average breakfast place. Prices are fair... my chicken fried skillet was $10.50 and the carnitas skillet was about $11.

Service: Excellent
Food: Average to below average
Price: Fair for what you get, but with added costs of having to uber it there and back, it isn't worth it. 

Preliminary: We went on a Monday morning and there was no line and service was great. Other than that, the restaurant was lacking and not worth the trip from the strip. Just FYI, these Egg & I restaurants are independent from one another as I heard the staff tell another customer.

My wife and I went on a Monday morning. The reviews said their would be lines, but we encountered none. 

We got a variety of food. She got coffee, pancakes, scrambled eggs, and turkey ham.  I got OJ, hot tea, biscuits and gravy, potatoes, and turkey sausage (they only have patties in turkey sausage).  

She said her coffee was good, the eggs were as expected, but nothing spectacular, and she liked the turkey ham. The pancakes were not cooked all the way through. She ate about 1\/3 before she got to the middle to discover the undercooking. The restaurant offered to toss them back on the griddle, but she declined as she wanted to eat my potatoes (which were very good).  They brought out a chocolate muffin to make up for it. It hasn't been eaten yet, but I suspect it's pretty decent. 

As for my food, the potatoes were really good! Like really good.  Well seasoned and smaller and crispy, the way I prefer them to be. My wife liked them as well.  My turkey sausage was  undercooked and cold when served.  If you like hot tea like me, savor your first tea bag, because that's all you'll be getting for the $2.50 it costs to get hot tea. And perhaps it was my mistake for ordering biscuits and gravy; as a southern man, maybe my standards are too high. The meal was reminiscent of what you get at a Holiday Inn continental breakfast in the south. Seriously, no joke, and I feel bad about saying it like that, but it's true. The biscuits were hard and as if they were precooked and then microwaved when the dish was ordered. The gravy was ok, but nothing special.

My friends and I walked in on a Friday afternoon and were seated immediately. The host and servers both gave us a warm welcome. My favorite part of the table set up was their egg signal at the top of their center piece. It was a photo of an egg that you could flip to indicate to servers that you needed something. No one waving your hand to try to get the servers attention, they got a system down!

Next, the food, I ordered corned beef hash and eggs, while my friend customized her scramble with chorizo plus biscuits and gravy.. The bf got some avocado omelette. All were delicious and the portions were huge! It looked like I barley made a dent in my food, but I was stuffed. The biscuits and gravy were probably some of the best I've had... And their banana nut muffins are worth a try for muffin fiends. Straight out of the oven to your table.

I tend to go to this location more often though, and recently, it was the first time I had brought my husband and dogs with me.

Our server fussed over our pups and brought them water so major bonus points for that. She also made sure we had patio heater nearby. Even though there was only one other occupied table outside, we were still checked on frequently.

I had a lovely vegetarian omelette, but I was really crazed over my banana nut muffin. It was better than I remember, and it was actually steaming in the cold weather. I felt bad for all the yum noises I was making because my husband is gluten free. Speaking of which, when the waitress asked what bread he wanted on the side, he said none, and she offered to bring him a side of fruit. He was very appreciative. My husband declared his corned beef hash to be the best he's ever had, and he might have gotten a second order if he didn't have part of my meal to finish off.

I was told I could not substitute, even if paying an up charge, and would have to actually get an order of pancakes. This is the first time I have run into this problem. She also told us we could not get separate checks at the table and would have to take care of that at the register.

The Chicken Enchilada Omelette is pretty good too.  The chicken inside is tender and flavorful paired with all the condiments on top.  All the dishes are huge and plentiful.  I can never finish it, but that can also be that I scarf down as many muffins on the table and more! lol Still the food is pretty good and the seasoned potatoes are delicious! ^_^ Yum Yum.

The second time I had the chili omelet. Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh delicious. They have a meat\/no meat option, which is cool. And obviously I opted for the meat option. It was all cooked perfectly.

My favorite item has to be the potatoes though. Perfect little square-cut potatoes that are seasoned with what I can only describe as a mixture of the Red Robin's burger seasoning and tiny little kicks to your mouth. It's spicy but...not, if that makes sense? Probably not. You really just to go in and try.

Some plates come with what they call diabla sauce and it's delicious but beware - they charge $1 for extra.
