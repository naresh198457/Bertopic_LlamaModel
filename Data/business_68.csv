Many years ago this was a great little place called the Village Pub. That was back in the 70s. I once had dinner with Joyce Dewitt here.

Well the days of dining with celebrities here are long gone. Let's flash ahead 30 plus years to my current review.

I work down on the strip and knowing the kind of riff raff that hangs out around here I wasn't expecting much from this experience. As soon as I stepped into the place my expectations were fulfilled. The place was dingy and crowed with the typical prostitutes, drug pushers, losers and other assorted parasites of society you'd expect to see in a bad part of town.

The place has the worst sound system of any karaoke bar I've ever visited.

The staff was slow and seemed bored with their jobs.

Despite all these positive attributes I think I'll refrain from visiting again.",1,1,1

If you're not interested in the false pretenses all the other strip casinos subscribe to run here.  My wife and I enjoyed the steak special (off menu 12oz sirloin for $7.99), great value!  We played roulette and blackjack before and after and enjoyed ourselves; low minimums, and a good environment to gamble in if you don't need overpriced chandeliers and dancing waters.
This will be included in my must visit list for future Vegas trips.",0,0,0

1. Microbrews at less than $3 a pint (try their craft root beer, too!)
2. Gigantic delicious rib dinners with all the sides\/trimmings for less than $15 (join their free players' membership for discounted dinners).

Rib dinner goers beware: they close at 10:00pm, meaning that THEY STOP SEATING AT 10:00pm EVEN IF YOU ARRIVE AND GET A NUMBER BEFOREHAND. Make sure to get there no later than 8:00pm if you want your number to get called. After that, the host will warn you that there is no guarantee of seating and you would have wasted 1.5-2 hours waiting. Their dining area is extremely small and our group barely slipped by before the cut-off. Whew! :)",4,0,0

Steak wasn't the best I've ever had, but for a price like that, I can deal with it. Especially since you also get soup\/salad, a dinner roll, and a potato (cooked in any of the usual ways: fried, mashed, baked). 

For you non alcoholic drinkers, their root beer is amazing. As for their beer, it may not be the best beer ever, but it's pretty good - especially since it's so cheap. 

One of the things I like most about this place, is you won't find very many tourists. Hell, if I were a tourist and saw the place - I probably wouldn't want to go in considering how all of the other casinos look. So, this is a great local spot to go to. Especially if you're broke. 

I go there mostly to drink, mainly because I've had some bad experiences in the cafe. I muster enough courage to go back in every now and then, but for the most part - it's all about the gambling and drinking for me.",2,1,0

The food is still the best bang for buck! Prime rib, steak, shrimp all good & all very affordable. 
The beers are still pretty standard stuff. We did try the summer shandy which could have been a bit colder but managed to wash down our choices for dinner just fine.

I think they had karaoke and Metro Pizza. That was the reason we stopped in. I really don't remember much from that night. I do remember drinking many beers there though. Anyways, I recently stopped back at Ellis Island for breakfast the other morning because some people I know said they had good steak and eggs.

Ellis Island is on Koval Ln just South of Flamingo Road. It is connected to a Super 8 Motel or a Hotel 8. It's something like that. I know there is an 8 in the name. You don't need to know the hotel name anyways. I am sure it is not on my list of hotels I would like to stay at. Like I said, we are talking about the corner of Flamingo and Koval. If your from Vegas you know what I mean.

As far as the casino goes....not somewhere I would gamble, that is if I gambled. It is a very small casino and it looks like it should be located on Flamingo and Koval. I think I saw 2 pits in there. They also have some slot machines like every other building in this city. There is a bar in the middle of the casino that is a local favorite for many employees of neighboring casinos in the area. There is also a very small Metro Pizza location there. It is also a brewery, so they have a section where they brew and store their beer. It is a very old place and the decor is out dated.

Oh yeah. Steak & eggs. The reason I stopped in there. It was $5.99 for a New York Strip, eggs, potatoes, and toast. The steak was not grass fed dry aged steak by any means, but it was okay for a $5.99 breakfast. I have had worse steaks at much nicer restaurants that costed me at least twice as much, so taking the cost of the breakfast in to consideration....I got what I paid for. I also had scrambled eggs, country potatoes, and toast. All of which were okay. Again, $5.99.

I would recommend  stopping in for breakfast at Ellis Island once in a while if you work in the area. It is not a place I would drive out of my way to eat at though.",2,2,2

We followed her instructions and ended up in what must have been the hotel continental breakfast for the Super 8 motel. The gentleman at the continental breakfast directed us back over to the hostess stand. 

You think she would have asked us if we were there for the continental breakfast or to eat at the restaurant before directing us to leave the restaurant. 
If we hadn't walked so far we would have left right then.  

We were glad we stuck it out. The same woman who had misdirected us sat us with no apology or reference to her error. Our server made up for her lack of service. He was Amazing. Attentive. Friendly. All the things you look for in a server.

There were a number of food places in this casino. We ended up in the Cafe. The selection of food here was great and the affordable price even better! I had the pork chops meal for something like $8.99. No wonder the place always had long waiting lists... it goes by pretty fast, though, and we were seated quickly (10 min wait).  Service was good. Not located on the strip but worth visiting if looking for a cheap place to eat.

The prices are insanely low and you get a TON of food. $12.99 will get you a steak & a beer! Their deals are fabulous and you get way more than you pay for. I seriously don't know how they do it, but please, keep it up!

The casino and restaurant are not the greatest by far, but you'll get cheap tables ($5 craps anyone?) and there's plenty to do while you wait for dinner (and trust me, you'll be waiting for at least an hour to be seated). Ellis Island is not far from The Strip, so if you don't have a car, a cab ride will not cost you much at all plus you'll be saving so much money on dinner.

Well, I've lived in Vegas for 14 years and I went to UNLV for 4, and I just recently visited for the first time. It was for the Food Truck Smashup last month. While the event itself was pretty good, I wasn't impressed with EI. I thought the porter I had was decent, but the hard lemonade was disgusting.

Luckily, first impressions aren't always all that lasting. I went back with a super Yelp crew for Bobby Y's birthday. We ate at the BBQ restaurant and I am happy to report that it was pretty damn good. Some of us ordered a full rack of ribs while others got half ribs and half chicken.

Do yourself a favor. Order a full rack of ribs. There's nothing wrong with the chicken, but it pales in comparison to the ribs. I dare say that they are some of the best ribs in Vegas. OK so that's not a difficult thing to do. Outside of Top Notch BBQ, we don't have a lot of good BBQ in Vegas. Why is that?

Anyway, I'm now a fan of EI. I would most definitely return for another BBQ plate.",3,1,4

I was staying on the strip and dropped in for supper at their BBQ restaurant.   This was one of the best deals I had in Vegas.   I had a 2 for 1 coupon for the BBQ.  The requirement to use the coupon was to join their players club (which I did) and they gave me a food credit of $5.

Placed two orders for the 1\/2 chicken and 1\/2 rack of ribs combo ($8.99).   Their 1\/2 rack is a full rack back home.  The serving was huge and I must admit that the food was very good.  Quality was surprising very decent.  After using the coupon and applying my food credit, I ended up paying around 6 bucks for two meals....what a deal.

Of course, I proceeded to lose $100 at their blackjack table after this hearty meal....Damn you, Vegas!!!!

The dealers were very friendly and it felt like I was in Old Vegas.  I love it when I can have a conversation with the dealers while we play (I'd ask stupid questions like what is the biggest loser\/winner you dealt with, weird situations while working, etc.).   

It was very slow the Monday night I was there (so no karaoke was happening).   I hope this place makes it through this tough time.

No, our plates were not mixed up, the little fork thingies on the steaks indicated how they were cooked. None of them were correct.

As soon as we walked into the Café we were greeted right away by a very friendly hostess and immediately sat at a booth. Our server came around promptly asking for drinks and any appetizers.  Once we had a few minutes to look over the menu, I put in an order for the King's Cut Prime Rib meal which included a choice of one the house brewed beers.  I chose the light beer to go with my meal. My wife  ordered the onion ring appetizer, and the shrimp scampi meal.  The wait time for our meal to arrive I would consider normal, as with the appetizers too.  Our server came around frequently for refills on my water and my wife's iced tea. 
Once our meals arrived to our table, we immediately noticed that the shrimp scampi plate my wife ordered resembled soup. It had an overwhelming amount of oil left on the plate. The shrimp were large and butterfly cut, but were indeed overcooked as they were extremely rubbery. The overall taste of the scampi dish was on the bland side. Less oil, more garlic, salt, and herbs are expected.
My dish, the Kings Cut Prime Rib was a decent sized portion. Cooked to order (which was medium) and it was served hot. My meal included a baked potato and garlic green beans which were quite tasty. My only gripe was that the roasted outer portion of my prime rib needed much more salt and pepper to balance out the seasonings. 

The house brewed light beer was excellent!!  It was not heavy at all as I drank this while eating my hearty meal. I need to also mention that the appetizer we ordered (onion rings) were very tasty.  It was a smooth flavorful batter that was not breaded. We really enjoyed munching on them!  
Overall our experience was ""middle of the road"" (hence the 3 stars) as far as the execution of the food. The service was prompt, attentive, courteous, and friendly. The dining area was clean and well organized.  Parking was not any hassle as we found an open spot immediately.

  What I didn't like:

 1. It looked run down, maybe a little bit dirty. 
 2. The food was right from the freezer into the fryer. I had some shrimp thing and a heavily salted French dip. It was cheap, but sat in my stomach for the rest of the day. 
3. They were running some scam where if you joined the players club and played a dollar you got free play or something. After jumping through a few hoops and completing the requirements I was told I wasn't eligible because I had signed up a few years previously. They couldn't tell me that before I completed the requirements for some reason. 
4. When I tried to get the rest of my $$ out of the machine it wouldn't work and I had to wait 20 minutes while they called maintenance to get it out.

Inclusive of soup or salad, bread, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, and a LARGE 16 oz crafted draft beer. Tip included ! The bar is 3 bucks for beers, again 16 oz.

This is a local joint so don't expect debutante's in hooker heels and plastic tiaras celebrating their bridal shower. Instead saunter into the karaoke room adjacent the casino and watch some UNIQUE Local talent belt out some old school rock and roll. There is usually a long list waiting to perform. While waiting for a table for dinner I suggest you grab a beer and enjoy the show.  Or walk over to a $5 roulette table and feel like a big wheel with $50 bucks to spare.

You can walk from Planet Hollywood. It is 30 minutes though and taxi's do not frequent this area much. Uber or call for a cab if you'd rather not wait.

This place had votes for having some of the Best in Vegas (along with Bouchon)! Of course being a Breakfast Feen and a French Toast Junkie (at times), I made my way here..

* I got here on a Sunday morning and there was an anticipated line but the Host noticed I was alone and quickly called me over and sat me right away. My server dropped off a menu pronto, as if I had a reservation waiting for me.. Coffee was poured soon after and order taken as well..

Cinnamon Vanilla French Toast & Bacon: In my opinion, This was the Best French Toast I've had.. It was Pristine in every aspect of what I know a Traditional based French Toast should be. Now, I've had fancy shmancy French Toast with exotic fruits toppings, syrups, bread.. Some were decent some were great but my preference with French Toast is simple but done well. This particluar one was hands down, bow down, and praises to the chef\/cook.. is on the top of my list. 

The saltiness of the long and medium cooked bacon (they weren't the 90% fat strips or short well done crispy strips) just brought it home! 

* Busser here was so attentive, well mannered, very friendly and very fast. 

I got better service here than 5 star\/diamond restaurants!!! French Toast is A 100% Must Try for those of you that appreciate an exceptional straightforward blue collar approach that would rival the Best of em'! Atmosphere felt fine and comfortable (like any other 24 hour cafe\/diner). To top off the icing, the meal was inexpensive!

I stayed at Tuscany Villas, which was within walking distance of Ellis.  No joke, two consecutive Uber drivers told me I HAD to go and try the steak (""best deal in town!"") and the ribs (""fall off the bone and there's so much you can eat them for days!""). So I HAD to go try the steak and ribs right?  I would also do a recommendation for Tuscany but I don't want more people to know about it (it's still rather affordable and huge rooms).

Sooo I ate the steak dinner here twice, and although I can be a creature of habit, it really is a good steak! First, a side salad, and then the steak--seasoned well, and tender; with a side of garlic green beens that still had that good snap to them; and a baked potato--for $9.99! What a deal?! And in my opinion just yummy.

Oh!  And duh, they're a Brewery so they brew their own beer and they're $2.50 a pint. For a hefeweizen! And a damn good one! I am partial to hefeweizens but I'm sure the other ones are good too.  And if you're a degen like me you can play video poker at the bar and they're free :)

Still need to go back to Ellis to try the chicken fried chicken for breakfast, as well as the rib place that's located towards the back of the casino.  Both of which I've heard are ridiculous.

While the $6 Steak and Eggs special is in Sam's Town, Ellis Island is actually minutes from the strip. Yes, even though it's @ $6.99 (instead of about just $6 total at Sam's Town), you get their Sirloin Steak special. 

It includes a Sirloin steak cooked how you like it, baked, mashed or fried potatoes (fries), a side of veggies, soup or salad, AND if you choose, a tall stout of their home brewed sarsaparilla aka root beer or beer (alcohol)! Insane, right??

I chose the soup (which was clam chowder) and I expected it to be pure sodium overload, surprise, it WASN'T. It was just right. I didn't need to season it, nor did I need to drink a gallon of water after eating my soup. It had the right amount of chunks, be it potato, or sweet savory clam, it was spot on.

My potato (baked), was really good again. It wasn't gourmet, but seriously, it's a baked potato, how wrong can you be making one?

The side of veggies, were green beans, which again, decent. 

The steak, really good for the price I'm paying. I wasn't expecting filet mignon, but the cut wasn't tough and it was cooked just right. 

The home brewed root beer was outstanding. If they bottled it here, I would buy a case and chug this on the drive back to L.A.

Most of my friends probably thought I was taking them there as a joke, but I can honestly say that I do not have a single friend who, after having a huge breakfast at Ellis Island, does not want to go back there every single time they are in Vegas! All the breakfast items are excellent - the ham steak is bigger than a grown man's head (as are the pancakes). I recommend getting an omelet and some french toast. The prices are so cheap you can order a few things and eat what you want. Their dinner salad is also delicious - I dream about the ranch dressing! I have mixed feelings about most of their non-steak special dinner items. Their dinner cobb salad (when offered) is delicious, but all the other dinner items I've ordered (pasta, chicken sandwich, battered fish) haven't been as tasty as I'd hoped relative to the divinity of their breakfast items. Note - they stopped serving breakfast 24 hours, but there are a few breakfast items that they will make outside of breakfast hours (like the chicken fried steak with eggs). Overall it's a great place to eat breakfast, and if you like steak, a great place to get a cheap but (supposedly - according to my friends who eat beef) delicious steak and fresh green beans.

Our hero only got complaints about the food from the party he was with the last time he was here.

It seemed to our hero that they have pretty high staff turnover here because he only recognized one server from the last time he came.

Still... you gotta give it to them that it's quite a good value for the food and most of the beers are still pretty good for two bucks!  Remember, a good rule of thumb for the Ellis Island beers are that the darker they are, the better they taste.

- The food's still cheap and filling.
- Some of the lowest limit gambling just a stone's throw away from the strip.

Coming in the late morning - it is Vegas after all and the only people awake in time for breakfast have not yet slept from the day before - I was hoping to have some eggs and potatoes. The normal breakfast menu was no longer being served and the only option was the Bacon and eggs. Being a Vegetarian I was offended by this and asked for a substitution, which was not allowed. I ordered it anyway with instruction that bacon not be brought out. The potatoes were terrible but the eggs were fine and the toast was over buttered. I had two beers while I was here. The first was the Amber Ale which was a true to style amber. The second beer I ordered was the IPA. Now the IPA, let me put it this way; I had to ask the waiter after a couple sips that he hadn't accidentally brought me the Light beer.  I then later also had the stout - while I played a hand of black jack - which was again a below average stout, no creativity: no wood aging or bourbon or dry hops nothing to make it stand out.  

But to get back to my wonderment of the 4 stars by my fellow yelpers; I fully understand the appreciation of this restaurant. The service was great, Alex was my server and he was extremely polite and attentive. The hostess was at the least bilingual and seemed to know some of the guests by name. Every guest that I could see in the restaurant was enjoying their meal and their company. 

When I started this review I had given this restaurant 1 stars but I bumped it up to 2 while I wrote this review.   I would tell all vegetarians or health conscious people to avoid this place, but if you want a good price on a steak and want to be welcomed with open arms than please come here. True beer lovers should also avoid this place given that there is good beer to be had in this town.  I am judging their beer by only three of the five brewed in house.",2,0,0

The $6.99 steak and eggs dinner was absolutely delicious and honestly it tasted as good as the dishes from the strip that start at $30. The plate comes with a nice sized steak, 2 eggs and country style potatoes which had the perfect amount of crunch. The toast was already buttered and tasted great. I can say that I enjoyed this meal much more than I did the Bellagio buffet. They also have delicious beer that is brewed in house, hard to believe from such a small place! 

Now on to the casino. The casino is small but cozy. They have a decent selection of slots and a few tables. We decided to sit at the $5 blackjack for some fun and to spend time away from the strip since we needed a break from all the chaos. The dealers at this place are super friendly and nice which is hard to find on the strip nowadays. We ended up sitting at the same table for about 7 hours and it was lots of fun. I will definitely come back on my next visit to vegas.

I had never heard of this place, it's off the strip (but not by much), older, and divey. They were hosting a BBQ that us yelpers were invited to as part of our trip. For $5 each, we got a combo of a choice of ribs, burger, hot dog, or turkey leg, potato salad, and corn on the cob. Plus, there was free beer and Malibu shots all night. Can you see why we all decided to come here?

We rounded up a crew of elites and made our way over. Of course I had to get the turkey leg, because, when do you ever get to walk around biting from a big ol' turkey leg?? It was great but the ribs were my favorite, with a sweet, smoky flavor and falling off the bone. As others here have said, good BBQ is hard to find and Ellis Island really makes themselves stand out. 

We signed up for the players club so we could enter a raffle, and we got to watch a hot dog eating contest, dance, get more free beers, and just hang out.

The beer itself is nothing to venture out for.  The stout is probably the best option, while the others seemed watered down\/unflavorful.  The IPA had no hop taste whatsoever.

We have been EI supporters for a very long time. We recommend EI to friends, family, and colleagues. We supported EI when they had food safety issues, when they increased the price of their unadvertised low quality steak dinner special to an advertised $7 steak dinner - it really isn't a special- just off the menu increased from $5 (that's a 40% increase). We ignored their pathetic poor service, even the grungy Super 8 where undesirables stay.  But like all good things...they must come to an end. We can no longer support EI. 

The final straw came when they started increasing the price of their steak dinner incrementally AND quickly.  Portion size started dropping too.  Perhaps we should be using a magnifying glass to look at our plates?

What people may not know is that EI was in fact the number one top 10 listed and printed bargain in Vegas. That's no more. Their ranking had dropped. EI  now force you to spend $5 where you print out two coupons from an EI kiosk, the second after playing at least $5 in any slot machine with your club card inserted, to get the $8 price of their tiny steak dinner. That brings your steak dinner to $13, double what it was a a few years ago.   

If you're going to make it difficult for people to order your signature dish, you should give them some other incentive such as increase the portion size, not downsize them.  One food server told us discreetly and cynically that eventually management will serve you only a tablespoon or so of salad and tiny genetically modified potatoes alongside the ever shrinking steak where they claim it's 10 oz.  We don't believe that for a second that the steak is 10 oz, it's really small now.

Any way, I get that many people are giving EI rave reviews, they do not know it's history...and that history wasn't that long ago. Many have no concept of what value is. I have not seen a $2 beer on tap in a long time at EI.  Even many of the locals have stopped coming here. As another fyi. The $10 streak and eggs is quite pricey here, you can go elsewhere like a place called ArizonaC that serves it a lot cheaper. You can have a breakfast buffet for less than $10at the Orleans. 

On the plus side, not even the low grade prime rib (which is quite expensive even according to the new vegas standards) is worth having. Book an appointment for their bbq ribs and beans dinner\/platter. That's the only good thing now at EI.

In summary, from our perspective, we seen EI as the must goto must  place in Vegas.  Now it's some dive where we would be afraid of eating food. We think it's days might be numbered. Perhaps it will be sold or more likely demolished. Sadly, it no longer lives up to the traditional Las Vegas tradition where you get genuine value for your dollar when it comes to eats.",3,0,0

Atmosphere 3\/5: The restaurant has a nice old bar\/pub kind of atmosphere. It's a descent place to go.
Food 3\/5: I've been for there many years and I always invited my friends and family at this restaurant for their steak special. I have tried the fish and chips but the steak is really the way to go. Unfortunately, adding to the terrible service last time, the food was mediocre! My steak which needed to be medium was well done which changed the entire experience foodwise! I didn't even finish my plate since it felt like the steak was just not eatable. I'm giving a 3-stars for food only because I am a regular and I know how good the steak can be.
Service 0\/5: 0\/5? This is the worst service I ever had and I'm usually not giving any name but Eugene, despite trying to be polite, was NOT doing his job right. We had the bad luck to get seated in a confusing area for the waiters there. We had to wait 20 minutes to have our order taken. Yes I asked meanwhile to at least 4-different waiters to take our order or bring our server to the table etc... I even asked the elderly lady working for a long time who seats people to bring our server but NOTHING!!! Wow! Finally, Eugene came to take out order meanwhile saying that he didn't know where our server was. Now, the problem was that they had a miscommunication between waiters on how many tables they needed to take care and we were the exact table that brought confusion in their team. Fantastic! Thinking that this experience, I decided to give a chance to this server but I quickly learned my lesson after the 2nd time! Eugene brought our salad after 5 minutes but we had to wait 25 minutes to get those steaks. Meanwhile, you couldn't find him or if he was in the dining room, he was horrible at making sure his tables were all alright! Now the ironic thing was that people who took their order after us got their food before us! 25 minutes later and literally only 7 tables left in the Dining room, we get our steak and you know the rest... Overcooked & uneatable!

Overall, I've worked in restaurant and I understand that miscommunication can happen in the team but I don't understand why a customer needs to pay the price of your mistakes and wait 20 min for an order to be taken!

Gaming:  Slots, roulette, black jack, craps and some other poker-type tables.  They have $3 blackjack during happy hour.

Food:  Very good restaurant in the casino.  Get a New York steak dinner with salad and a beer from $9!  All of the other food is really good, too, and very reasonable.  The place is also a brewery, and it is the best beer I can get anywhere.  But, be careful, it is strong.  Drinking four beers seems like drinking eight.  Best of all, the beers are $2 for a 22oz!  I love this place.

They also have karaoke, other restaurants, a BBQ restaurant (really good) and a pretty good players' club.  The staff is either really good, or basically rude.  In the restaurant you always get great service.  At the bar and casino floor, either the staff is really positive and helpful, or ""leave me alone"" and mean.

Is this the best steak you'll ever have? Heck no. But where else can you regularly get soup or salad to start, and a filet cut top sirloin with choice of potato and green beans for $8? Nowhere, I tell you. The best part about this deal? It comes with a free beer (or rootbeer.. get a beer, sissy). And their beers are pretty darn good.

I personally love the taste of sirloin. I think filet mignon is overrated in everything but it's tenderness (ribeye.. that is all.) The sirloin at Ellis is hit or miss, really, both in preparation and in quality. Sometimes I've gone and it's been tender, and sometimes my jaw is sore by the end of dinner. I usually order medium-rare and it's usually medium or medium-well, occasionally rare, and once in a blue moon, cooked correctly. The green beans are fresh green beans and are sometimes still crisp, and sometimes really mushy and buttered with loads of fresh garlic. The baked potato is standard, and the mashed potatoes come with gravy that is much like cafeteria gravy and is oddly satisfying in that way.. steak fries are steak fries. The soups change day to day and range from chili to New England clam chowder (surprisingly good). The salads are your standard iceberg romaine carrot purple cabbage mix with croutons and cherry tomatoes, but their Italian dressing is made in house and it is bangin'.

Other dishes: Orange Roughy - delicious. Fish n Chips - delicious! (Same as Village Pub, but cheaper at Village Pub). Clams - good, fresh. French onion soup - super greezy. I think the bread they use is a piece of garlic bread. They also have the mandatory casino breakfast specials that seem like a good deal, I've never tried them.

This is an $8 steak. This is not a steak house. This is the kind of steak that benefits from being cooked a little more by getting just a bit more tender.. go medium-rare. For the price, you won't have any regrets. Unless you're a vegetarian (sissy).",2,1,0

OK, Ellis Island is a dump of a casino, it looks old but it has three things going for it...........BBQ baby back ribs, BBQ chicken and onsite brewed beer. They cook the ribs in the parking lot as you enter from Koval.

They brew their own (multiple beers). $1.75 for an 20 ounce glass...... And they make (non alcoholic) root beer too............... I'm hooked on the lite beer.

OK, here is my humble opinion. I can drop a $100+ bucks easily on myself for dinner at the right place 7 days a week if I wanted to. I just wanted to be clear that I'm not cheap.

Ellis Island was mentioned to me about two years ago and I finally went in June 2011. I'm not a fan of BBQ because I don't like the mess and usually the lack of meat on the rib bones. You WON'T have that problem here. For $13, you can get at least an 18 inch+ rack of baby backs, (BBQ beans, slaw, bread and corn on the cob very average). You can also get a rib\/chicken combo. There is a pizza place within spitting distance that serves great pizza by the slice that you can bring to the table (our appetizer).

I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK........... And I'll get two racks of ribs next time because they were that damn good and cheap.

I think a lot of the time people go into a place with really low expectations and then when a place is better than they expected they think it is better than it is and rate it higher than they should. That has to be the case with the restaurant at Ellis Island. 

That's not to say the place isn't good because it is. I went there this past weekend when we were looking for a cheap steak and someone recommended this place. When we arrived we noticed that there was a big food truck festival out front. You would think with everyone eating from the trucks that the restaurant would be empty, but much to my surprise there was still a 30 minute wait for a table. 

Turned out that was good cause it gave me time to get a tetanus shot which should be required upon entering the building. After checking out the food truck festival and chatting with people at the Yelp booth I sat down at a video poker machine to gamble for a little bit until the table was ready. True story, one of the girls from the Yelp table took a break and came over to where I was playing video poker and hit on me! Awesome!! (for the record she was cute as hell, but I had other plans for that night). 

Okay, back to the review. When they finally got around to seating us and after looking at the menu we decided on the fillet special. For $7.99 you get a steak, vegetable, choice of potato, soup or salad and one of their homemade beers or root beer. 

I chose the salad, which legally qualified as salad because it had lettuce. Don't expect much from it though, it is literally lettuce, salad dressing, 2 cherry tomatoes and nothing else. It was fine, but nothing special. 

When the dinner came, I was a little disappointed in the vegetable offering. The special came with green beans, but I don't like green beans so I asked if there was another vegetable offering and the waiter offered to replace the green beans with the mixed vegetable which turned out to be more green beans with some corn and carrots mixed in. I didn't try them. My friend had the green beans and initially said they were good, but then didn't eat them, so take from that what you will. 

The baked potato was perfectly fine. It's kinda hard to mess up a baked potato and they didn't. 

The steak was a very pleasant surprise. I honestly didn't expect much from a $7.99 steak in this kind of place, but it was very good. Tender, no real gristle cooked exactly as I had ordered it. I ate every bite and was very satisfied by it. 

Having major drinking plans for later that night, we just got the root beer as our drink. I have to say, the homemade root beer was damned tasty. And I highly recommend that! 

The service was okay, but we weren't offered any dessert. 

The atmosphere was like a Coco's that hasn't been updated in 30 years and was quite loud. 

So look, is the place bad? Definitely not! 

Is it worthy of 4-stars? Absolutely not! 

Was it the best $7.99 steak I have ever had? YES! 

I can't say I would go back and I can't say that I would recommend it, but I wouldn't avoid going back and wouldn't tell anyone else to avoid it either.",4,0,0

Let's see..

This is where Las Vegas' locals are hanging out. You will see characters here. This is also where I won money on the Sex & The City slot machine (This machine hates me at every other casinos in Vegas).

This is where you can get the $6.95 steak special (steak, potato, and salad) but you have to ask for the special. I didn't get the steak, after days in Vegas of nothing but heavy food, I decided that I was in the mood for soup and salad. 

Their soup was Split Peas soup and it was amazing. I didn't sugar coat this fact, but their split pea was delicious. The salad was fresh and I was a happy diner. Service was outstanding.

Since we were already seated and it'd be a hassle to do it.. he said he could just charge $10 and do it without me having to get the card and what not.

Cons: Took a little while for the food to come out, but it was a bit crowded and the place is understaffed. The place is pretty small in general including the tiny packed casino. Can't complain about the quality of the food because the quality outshines the price any day anywhere... umm.. nothing much really..

Bottom line: Cheap good eat. Go here. No I really mean it. I wanted to go here because I wanted to splurge on something else on a different day, but I ended up getting much more than what I paid for. The casino isn't bad either. Cheap tables and cheap beer",1,0,0

Around 4 pm on a Saturday, we were directed to the café, which was the wrong place in this tiny casino.  We found a long line next to the Brewery and pizza stand and so we followed the hungry crowd and waited.  

I'm so glad we waited!

My brother got the babyback rib platter for only $11.99. This large platter included 2 corn ears, grilled sourdough bread, corn slaw, and beans.  I opted for the half chicken and half rack of babybacks for only $8.99.  This platter also came with the aforementioned sides.  The ribs were succulent, falling off the bone.  They rate up there with some of the finest ribs we've had at the Reno Rib Cook-off.  We also ordered their freshly brewed root beer, which was a sweet compliment to the spiciness of the barbeque sauce. 
       
Only paying a little over $20 total for what could easily cost more than $50 elsewhere, I thought we were being punked and we were ripping them off.  With the size of the platter and the quality of the barbeque at such a bargain, it felt like we were being comped free dinners.  Once we sat down, service was pretty quick.  There's also patio seating, which is overflow seating when the small dining room is full.

Pretty easy, 5 minutes and i was done.  Anyways, the special comes with a 8oz sirloin, mashed potatos, green beans, a soup or salad, and also a beer.  NIce!

Food comes out and my steak while cooked perfectly, is pretty tough.  The prime rib is also served as requested but i guess it cooked itself sitting on the plate because after about 3-4 bites, the pink color started to go away.

Prime rib was definitely better than my steak.  Mashed potatoes were the best thing we had but probably cuz of the salty gravy.

i went there for the first time 2 weeks ago and made it a point to go there again this past Halloween weekend. the $6.99 steak meal is the only thing you'll ever need. it covers all the bases. you get a soup or salad to start, a nice steak, sting peas, a potato (you get to choose: mashed, baked, or fries), and a tall glass of beer brewed on location in their microbrewery! beer choices include: light, amber, hefeweizen, or root beer (delicious!). ...yes, all for the can't pass up price of $6.99.  ellis stomps on any steak and egg deal i've ever been to. i mean, why go somewhere else and pay the same price for a plate of a flat piece of steak, two eggs, and some hash browns that are undercooked?  especially when you get a nice juicy piece of steak PLUS a BEER! and don't forget the salad that comes as your pre-meal warm-up. seriously, the only place to get a cheaper meal of nearly the same caliber would have to be from 7-eleven two doors down, and can you really compare a hot dog that's been rollin' around for a minimum of 7 hours or one of those freezer sandwiches to a steak and potato - i didn't think so!

 Ellis Island is a comparatively small property two blocks east of the Strip. But two blocks in 40*C is a bit too much to walk, so take a cab. You'll find a small, friendly hotel with the inevitable casino, with its own microbrewery, a comfortable restaurant, and The Village Bar, a hang-out for locals.


 In the restaurant, you can eat a substantial meal (all the American favourites) for about $10-12, and drink a pint of their own beer for $1 a glass. The Casino has less of an 'edge' to the house, for example 1-deck Blackjack instead of the normal 2 or 3 deck versions on The Strip. In the bar, you'll rub shoulders perhaps with workers who are refreshing themselves after a day of toil, and who are more than willing to chat about baseball or American football or politics.

Little did the s\/o and I know that there's a little hidden gem of a dive where they allegedly serve up some good Prime Rib, so we just had to make a stop.

We had dinner at their Cafe this past Tuesday night and fast forwarding through the 30-minute wait, we figured that had a to be a good sign, for a little dive casino off the Strip.  We get seated and man, it felt like I was in a bad dream; sitting in a semi-dimly lit restaurant, with a little cigarette smoke lingering in the air and decor that matched that of Mike & Carol Brady's vacation home, if they ever had one.  Not to mention, the most horrible Karaoke singers I've ever heard.  It was quite entertaining, especially for the setting but there were times, it felt like we were on some hidden camera show.

Without hesitation, we both were going to order their King Cut Prime Rib dinner, which came with a salad, veggies and choice of Potato, as well as Root Beer or their house Beer.  When our server took our drink order, I ordered a Coke.  Apparently, when it came time to order, I wasn't able to sub my Coke for the Root Beer it came with, not sure why, my Coke was technically a penny cheaper.  But whatever, I took the Root Beer anyhow...and took the cost of my Coke from our server's tip.  Speaking of which, yeah, our server and the restaurant staff was so jaded.  Service with a smile goes a long way...and so will your tip, so turn that frown upside down, ladies and gentlemen.

We didn't have high expectations for the Prime Rib, being that was ultra cheap at $13 a pop.  When our food came out, I didn't care much for the presentation, as it was quite sloppy.  The au jus spilled onto the plate, the sour cream was served it's own individual packet that you had to rip open, the horseradish was in it's own indivdiual plastic cup.  But, when all was said and done, I took a bite into the Prime Rib; first bite was good, figured it was the outside because of the seasoning so I started going towards the middle.  Second, third, fourth and so on...I finished that slab of King Cut without hesitation.  I was so impressed, not that I finished it but, it was a delicious cut of Prime Rib that'd make the bigger, bling casinos on the Strip bow their head in shame.  Shoot, I bowed my head in shame for discrediting this spot!

We always get the steak special, which is 8.99 (with your players club coupons that you print out from the machine) and includes a huge beer, steak, potato, green beans and soup or salad. Usually it is great, but unfortunately it can be fairly inconsistent. My husband and I can order the exact same thing and our steaks look completely different and one can be medium well and one can be practically raw. 80% of the time, it is a great dinner, but it's that 20% that bums you out sometimes. Also, my daughter ordered the fried chicken once, and while 3 pieces were perfect, one was raw inside...obviously that is fairly dangerous and something that shouldn't have happened. 

I will say that we have brought all out of town family here, and they all love it, rave about the good deal, and the beer, and always want to go every time they come out, so there is something about this old school place that people (especially the old people) are drawn to. 

My favorite thing about the whole place is the beer. I LOVE the Hefe Weiss. LOVE IT! It is dirt cheap or free if you get the steak special. Also, I find the more Hefe I drink the less I care about the bad stuff about this place ;-)

As everyone has said, it is extremely smoky. I find the restaurant to not be too bad with the smoke drifting in, but the casino and bar are bad! We have watched karaoke in the bar, and my throat hurt for a day afterward because of all the smoke. Also there is one bathroom in the whole place and while I have never had to wait in line, that walk feels longer and longer as the night (and the beer drinking!) go on. 

So I would say if you are NOT a foodie, like a super cheap meal, and can deal with some cigarette smoke, you will probably enjoy this place. So many of the strip casinos have gotten so over-priced and pretentious, that it is nice to have this place as an option when you just want something cozy and old school.",4,0,2

My friend and I were on the search for food and wanted steak and eggs. (who doesn't love steak and eggs at 4AM in the morning??) I started yelping stuff and we ended up at Gold Coast. Couldn't even find steak and eggs there! It was a TGIF (major fail and a waste of a taxi ride!) 

I yelped again and found Ellis Island so we decided to take another taxi ride over there. This place is right behind Bally's (where we were staying) and definitely walkable. Service was nice and the food was definitely worth the $6.99 (?) we paid for? haha that night is still a little blurry and I can't remember exactly how much we paid. But it was definitely comparable to Bill's steak and eggs (our usual spot).

After a conference a large group of us went there for some karaoke fun.   We had no knowledge of the place, and in typical Vegas style got a Hummer Stretch Limo to carry all of us to the destination.  Upon arrival we quickly realized the limo was very much over-the-top.  

When you walk in the smell of mold, bad beer, and cigarette smoke is enough to knock you over.  Directly in the front doors lies the casino, and to the left is the karaoke bar.  The group of us headed into the bar, and were instantly ostracized by the local crowd.  It was 9:30 on a Wednesday evening and the place was packed to the rafters.  We managed to find a corner to hold up, even though we called ahead for reservations.  When I attempted to sit at a table, I was immediately shouted at by an older man sitting alone at the table meant for four.  I was advised, ""That was his table, no one sits at his table.""  

""Allrighty then..."" I thought.  ""This is going to be an interesting night.""

We ordered a selection of the house beers, and began making our way to start booking singing spots.  The first spot was 54 people behind in line.  

""Allrighty then...""

There was hope, if you signed up for the Ellis Island membership and played $50 of casino games you could jump the line.  We decided to wait it out.

After 15 minutes our first round of beers arrived.  Mine had a shard of glass in it.  I can't make this up.  Another 15 minutes a new Amber arrived.  My first sip: it was stale, warm, and overall terrible.  I tried to push through, but couldn't. I tried the lager with similar results (minus the glass the 2nd time around) and then switched to bottles of Budweiser, as at least I knew what I was getting into.

30 minutes in and my head was swimming from the cigarette smell, and I'm a smoker.  There was little to no ventilation present, and we had to go outside periodically to catch some oxygen.

On the positive side, the locals (other than the crazy table guy) were all very nice.  It was rapidly apparent this wasn't your ordinary karaoke bar.  The regulars at Ellis Island take things VERY SERIOUSLY. Especially the guy in a 4 piece white suit, singing ""This is why I'm hot"" with the most compassion I have ever seen from a human being.  When we eventually got up for a round of singing they would all clap, cheer and give us props as we headed back to our corner.  If it wasn't for them, the entire night would have been a nightmare.  

We didn't stay for a second round of songs, we had to get out of there; back to the strip full of oxygen and cleanliness.

The restaurant had plenty of people for such a wee hour in the night\/morning so the food should be OK. Maybe it was for other items, but our group was there for the cheap $4.99 steak and eggs deal. 

I don't know why they even ask how you want your steak done when ordering. When the steaks came out they were all well done or should I say terribly done. =(

The eggs and home style potatoes were OK, and what saved the meal from being completely inedible. When I eat steak I usually don't have to put any sauce on it, the natural beefy flavor and whatever marinade\/rub the steak had is enough. Never understood the love for A1 steak sauce till now.... that dried out and cardboard textured z-grade steak meat was improved 100 fold by the tangy A1 sauce and actually could be eaten. But hey if your eating low grade meat it's better that it's cooked well done for safety's sake. 

I'm glad I didn't finish the meal because who knows what would have happened. I woke the next morning with the most uncomfortable feeling ever that lasted the entire day, it was explained that I had a bad case of indigestion. I don't ever remember feeling this way, but I was physically ill.  =(",3,2,1

Well I can think of one thing. Whoever the female bartender is in the karaoke bar area on weekday late afternoons\/early evenings (last time I almost got to order a drink from her was Friday 5\/26\/17 around 5pm) is glacially slow and indifferent. Now maybe she is overloaded working the service bar and the regular bar but this is probably the 3rd time I have sat close enough to smell her perfume for over 5 mins without even a nod of acknowledgment. Truly poor service. It's sad that it is quicker to leave the karaoke area and walk to the very busy main bar and be able to get a drink from a truly awesome bartender like Anthony in far, far less time than it takes to order one from the ""I look like I'd rather be anywhere but here"" bartender where you are sitting. I'm not looking to get anyone in trouble here more like point out crappy service and hope to change it for the better

Food: steak and eggs for 5.99? Sure!  This isn't any angus beef rated steak but for the amount of money, why not eat it?  If you like your steak a little rare inside or even medium rare, ask for rare.  Why?  They cook it two ways, well done or rare.  The rare is a little pink inside and the medium rare is where their well done starts.  Not because they don't know how to cook, just because the steak is so thin.   The Sides it comes with is usually pretty decent too.

Service:  The service is SLOW.  I mean SUPER SLOW.  If you were waiting for your steak to cook on the sidewalk outside during the hottest day of summer in Vegas, you'd probably have a steak sooner than in this place.  They wait staff has a lot of tables to serve and they're also under staffed.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  This place is great to chill with friends while waiting for your cheap food.  It's just a thing to note if you're in a rush.

Overall, great prices for decent food and slow service.  It's vegas and it's off the strip, what do you want?

Pro: Friendly staff, great karaoke atmosphere, cheap drinks.

Con: The MC clearly plays favorites to locals and coworkers. She will tell you that ""you can not tip your way to the front of the line and everyone must wait their turn"", but then she'll let 80 year old Elvis sing 2 songs within a half hour and then the 60 year old Elvis gets 2 songs.

I've visited this bar 5 times within the past 3 years (every time I go to Vegas) and this has held true during all of my visits. Coworkers will also get to jump the line and sing multiple songs while out of towners have to wait about 1-2 hours per song. 

I look forward to visiting Ellis Island for karaoke, but I don't think its fair how the singing order is dictated by the MC. ARRIVE EARLY and good luck if you plan on singing more than 1 song. You will be there until they close waiting for your second song to come on. Dress like Elvis; you'll have better odds of getting to your second song.",0,0,0

It tastes like they boil the ribs, but they do the sauce justice! Smokey, sweet, tangy. The cole saw was above average and the corn was a buttery mess but still good eats. Don't come here with your small ones because they don't allow kids inside here, which is such a shame.  I think they have lost lots of business this way.

Here's the deal - if you want a steak dinner with baked potato or fries, salad, a side veg and a beer for 8 bucks, this is the only place in town.   The kids order the root beer - which is brewed on site, and hubby and I enjoy a micro brew. 

We've had this meal four or five times since we found out about it, and everything has always been perfectly cooked.  The steak is right on, the green beans crunchy, the salad cold and crisp, the baked potato piping hot and just done.  The food is fresh, and not over salted.  Simple, but it hits the spot.  The portions are generous, and we always end up with leftovers.

Yes, you have to walk through a noisy, smoky casino.  Yes, the wait will be at least 20 minutes.  Yes, occasionally the server's demeanor can be a tad abrupt - but at least they are fast - that's what happens when people pack into a restaurant for an 8 dollar steak.   Don't expect the server to have time for small talk.  We try to be organized so the server doesn't have to make special trips to our table.  We think about how much the same meal would cost us at another microbrewery and try to keep that in mind while tipping.  Why should the server be penalized because the steak is such a good deal?

I was surprised to see that the menu said $9.99. I know the price hasn't shot up that much since most of the photos on here are recent. My wife and I were about to leave when our waitress informed us of the special. Later on I asked the waitress why it doesn't say $5.99 on the menu. Basically so they don't run out if everyone orders it which makes sense. So don't leave if you don't see it on the menu, just ask your server. 
I have to say the steak was outstanding. I was going into this thinking it was going to be a dried out, overcooked, tough steak. Boy was I mistaken. It was a flame grilled moist NY strip steak. I order my steak medium well and it was cooked perfect. I would border to say it was steakhouse quality. It came with toast, scrambled eggs and hash Browns and that wasn't bad either. It was the deep fried hash Browns and scrambled eggs so it's not hard to mess those up. But to get all of that for $5.99 in Vegas is crazy.

Came here today around 7pm...  was told the wait would be about 45 min, although we were probably seated about 25 min later.  My friend and I both went with the steak special for $6.99.   Normally I'm bit of a steak snob...  and would never consider eating something like this...  I am of the opinion you can make as good or better steak at home than most restaurants (except the really good ones of course) serve for about $25.  I refuse to eat steak at places like Outback for example...  However for $6.99, who cares if it sucks.  

So, I went with the steak, medium-rare, baked potato, side salad and a root beer.  Salad was very basic...  but fresh and pretty good actually.  Root beer was delicious.  And the steak was actually pretty good.  It's a really thick cut sirlion, probably about in the 8 oz. range.  Was cooked pretty much how I ordered it (was actually kind of surprised they didn't overcook it more).  Baked potato was good and the green beens that came with it weren't bad either.  

For the price this really is a great meal.  You'd probably pay at least $15 for something similar at most ""cheaper"" restaurants, and it probably wouldn't be as good.  And they have both A-1 and heinz steak sauce if you so desire.  I'd definitely recommend ordering it mid-rare.... any more done and it would probably be a little tough...

I was out showing some new friends around Las Vegas and taking them to the more out of the way places tourist typically do not see. I thought Ellis Island would be the kicker for the night, because all four of the boys (Marines, btw) really wanted to do karaoke.

We arrived there a little after 11 PM and went to the karaoke bar and the place was pretty crowded. It looked like your Ellis Island crowd. I have been to Ellis Island before, just not to the karaoke part. Well we all got in no problem and grabbed some beers at the bar. Okay, they have incredibly cheap drinks. $1.75 for a beer. Crazy cheap. We all ordered a round of their in house light beer. Yes, they do brew their own beer, pretty cool. The boys went and selected their songs and my friend (who is a local) and I hung out to stalk a table.

Eventually a group left and we got a pretty sweet table in the back with a good view of the stage. Everything was going pretty cool - except for the fact the place was stifling hot! I don't know if they're trying to save money by not cranking up the AC, but when there are that many people in an old bar, you better get some AC running!! It did cool down, but being in a hot bar is just gross.

As we waited for the boys' names to be called we had another round and this time tried the Hefeweizen beer. Whoa. It tasted like orange juice, just straight up OJ with a splash of beer. I didn't really like it, neither did anyone else.

Finally the boys names came up and they went to sing. The first one went and then we waited. And then the next boy got called. Well, they were planning on singing a duet song (Brooks & Dunn I think) and the lady running the karaoke wouldn't let them! She said they couldn't because the first guy had just gone up to sing. It was a shame. Plus right after that they let another girl go up who had just been up on the stage about 20 minutes earlier. Just seemed eff'd up to me and we were all kind of pissed about it.

So, we left on a sour note. We didn't feel like waiting around through another 10 singers just for the boys to get another chance to sing.

It was pretty obvious they were letting people who are regulars there go up on the stage multiple times, but first timers not so much. I get it, it's a local place and a local event and that's who they're catering to - but they made ME feel bad because my friends got skunked out of doing karaoke!

There is ALWAYS a wait, I was there again this past weekend and the wait was over 1hr. But you can get a draft beer (for $1.50, brewed by Ellis Island, who actually was voted #1 micro brewery in NV, and top 20 in the US)  while you wait and play some slots or at the tables.

I have always wanted to come here but I never had the chance since I used all my possible tickets in Vegas elsewhere like Bacchanal Buffet, Oyster Bar and Tacos El Gordo. I promise, it was not because I didnt want to.

This small cafe I should say, is located on Koval Lane which is like the second next major street that is parallel to Las Vegas Blvd. I didnt know the cafe was located inside the casino so I walked into the lobby first and the housekeeper lady kindly told me its located in the next builiding inside the casino.

I walked in and found the cafe right away. It was a lot bigger than I expected. To check if I was in the right place, I asked for the menu and looked. After confirming I came to the right place, we got seated and our server took our drink orders really quick. 

Got King Cut Prime Rib which also comes with the salad and 20 oz beer with $2.25 charge & NY Steak and Fried Shrimp also with the beer with $2.25.

My prime rib was pretty huge. I was like 'whoa, seriously this big for only $13.99?' To be honest, it was a thicker and a bigger cut than the cut from my most recent visit to the Lawry's which I was very disappointed in. Anyway, my prime rib which I wanted in medium was close to medium rare but it was good nonetheless. Very juicy and tender and I enjoyed it very much.

NY Steak was pretty good too for its price, $11.99. It was cooked to perfection. Very tender. Really liked the fried shrimp as well. Super crispy and crunchy. There were only 5 pieces but it was good.

My beer, Hefe Weiss and Light, was both pretty good for its cheap cost. I personally liked Hefe Weiss a little more. I really liked how they tasted so light because I prefer light beers over dark\/IPAs.

My lunch was so fulfilling for very low cost. I will definitely come back next time. My server was super nice and she was pretty funny too. I highly recommend! This place isnt 'You get what you paid for'. It almost feels like I owe them so much more money than I paid. Come by and try!",5,0,4

And then they have this thing called head of the line pass which mean you can hear the same person 3 to 4 times before you can get one song in.

But although I am rating this place 3 stars (that's a-ok folks, don't freak out), my husband and I usually try to make a stop at this off the strip casino whenever we are in town. Why you ask? Well one of the big draws for us is that low minimum at the blackjack tables and the fact that during the day, they use only 1 deck (so a better chance of gambling in our favor... hey, the house doesn't always win now). 

Every time we have been here, the blackjack dealers have been very friendly and quite chatty (don't forget to tip them if they do a great job, especially if you are winning). And it is always a good idea to chat up the locals for some good restaurant suggestions (yes I know yelp.com should be the it spot for that, but in Vega$, wifi sure isn't free and also it's just nice to have some human face to face communication every now and then instead of just having my face in front of my phone or my tablet). 

Anyways, I think another major draw for others to come here is for the crazy cheap food they have here at the restaurant on site. The food is just average, but for the price, it's pretty good (but it's isn't healthy... yep, just had to bring that up... even on vacation I can't stop being a dietitian).

I'm thinking to myself how don't you know the FIRM ACTUAL up charge on this but whatever he checked with the source whomever that was and confirmed it was $2. You are the server so know your menu! I said that's no problem at all go ahead and order it! When our food came everybody's plate came correct but mine. Want to guess what didn't get done? Yep! My omelet came full of cholesterol and yellow as ever! It was clear that my simple request didn't get put in because he was to busy being so damn condescending. We brought this to his attention right away and he brought me a small plate to scoop my plate of potatoes on and the says ""well do you want me to have them make it over"" DUH wtf? After about 20 minutes I had finished my side order of pancakes and some of my friends plate because she felt bad that I still hadn't received my order. Another person in our party didn't et her wheat toast that came with her meal and had asked 3 times for it! Just a complete train wreck he was unapologetic for all this and then when our bill came we had a random 6oz New York steak and eggs added to our bill and I was double charged for my omelette. When again we brought this to his attention he says oh only the manager can fix this hold on, took the bill and went missing! After waiting about 10-15 minutes we still haven't got our correct bill so we spotted the manager TRICIA who was behind the scenes flagged her down and said can we get this done asap?! Her response was somewhat like she cared and when I pulled her to the side to let her know the unacceptable behavior from her serve JOEY and the lack of hospitality she apologized. Did nothing about the bill though they made sure they still collected them coins! Won't be back that's for sure!",5,3,2

Dollar for Dollar the best deals in Las Vegas!.
BUT....
DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY!

(Note: $6.99 steak special is now $7.99 and beers at the bar are now $1.75 [$2 in the restaurant])

THE STEAK SPECIAL:
6 oz thick cut sirloin, green beans, choice of potato (baked, fries, or mashed) salad or soup, bread AND a 20 oz Beer brewed on site all for $7.99. Of course it's not Del Frisco's, McCormick & Shmick's or similar...but it is still way above par for the value.
The steak is perfectly cooked to order 90% of the time. The bread is bland...but on Tuesday's they always have Split Pea soup and it is EXCELLENT. Otherwise just stick with the salad. If Susie is serving that day, request her. Sweetest and hardest working gal in this town.
*Note on service...to keep these prices what they are you have to cut corners somewhere. Servers typically have 5-8 table sections, and typically have 5-7 tables at a time...if you are in the industry RECOGNIZE this and have patience...if you have never worked in a restaurant, SHUT THE HELL UP and have patience.

THE BBQ: (Only available from 4pm-10pm each day)
With players card you can get a half rack for $7.99, a full rack for $11.99 and a half rack, half chicken combo for $8.99 (which is the best deal, but I hate BBQ chicken so stick with the full rack.)
These are among the best, and most consistent ribs in Las Vegas
Along with the ribs you get cole slaw (probably the worst on earth), garlic bread, corn on the cob, and baked beans (somewhat smokey and spicy to foil the rich sweetness of the bbq sauce.)
The service in the BBQ is a direct result of a constant 45 minute wait from the time. Think of this place like the Soup Nazi, except it's the BBQ Nazis...do not ask questions, you cannot substitute, they don't do to go orders, and they WILL skip you if you complain about the wait. 
******No one under 21 is allowed in the BBQ area****** So don't plan on taking the kids. 

There is also a Metro Pizza inside if you don't like (steak or bbq) which has 2 for 1 slices on certain days (i think monday or wednesday or both). Not the same quality of the restaurants but still good if you don't want to sit down and wait.

OTHER HIGHLIGHTS:
$5 table games  
Karaoke at the bar 7 nights a week
value of the quality beer (Here again....it's not dogfish head or similar but a great value.) My favorite is the Amber.
Although it's small they still have a sportsbook
Great frequent player program with lots of small prizes and giveaways nightly

To sum it up...if you are staying at a 5 star resort on expense account this is probably not your place (unless, like me, you like to slum it) But for the locals and those looking for the great deals around town give it a chance...it's dirty, the people aren't exactly supermodels and they are often grouchy....but it has no pretense and it always delivers what little it does promise.",16,12,6

I went to their summer kick-off beach party, where us Elite Yelpers were treated to a fab VIP section and great deals.  They really took care of us!  They offered a choice of BBQ selections and sides - I chose the ribs with corn and coleslaw.  I admit, I had been drinking, and when I'm drinking everything tastes amazing, but daaaaaaamn, those were some good ribs!  They were perfectly sauced and cooked just right.  Their regular beer prices are super reasonable, and their beer is brewed right there on-site.  I'm from Portland, aka Microbrew Capital of the World, so their beers didn't rock my world, but they were still pretty good.  I tried their hard lemonade though, and I had to put it down - icky.

When we were seated, for some reason, they thought it was wiser to split us up (a group of five) into two tables that were far apart from each other, even though there were other tables and booths nearby. They wouldn't even let us add one chair to the table so we could all sit together. Even worse, we waited for about 10 minutes and we hadn't even been asked what we wanted to drink.

Finally, a nice Polish waitress saw us and swiftly took our orders. When we told her about our table predicament, she said ""Really? Just go sit in that booth over there. I'll tell them I sent you there."" She single-handedly saved this establishment from losing business that day, and for that we tipped her nicely and I even learned to say ""thank you"" in Polish just to show how grateful we were.

Great Breakfast. I ordered the Ellis Island Classic Omelet, served BIG and flavorful with potatoes and buttery toast for ONLY 5.99. + Biscuits & Gravy for ONLY 2.99(check out photo). I would have gladly paid 2x-3x more for this delicious feast. My wife and I had to wait about 50 min. for a table at about 11am. But it was soooooo worth it. I occupied my time playing the $.05 poker, I put in $1 and played for 45mins till my table was ready. Cashed out at $1. 

The food was sooooo good that I came back that night after the club for early breakfast deal $4.99 for a New York Steak & eggs with potatoes. This time I tried the HEFE WEISS for $2, which is now my favorite beer.

The food here is roughly 1990 prices. If you lived in Vegas and didn't gamble, this city would have the lowest cost of living in the country.

The casino wasn't half bad either. It's close to the strip but not on it, which means $10 tables are available. I won a couple hundred bucks here. Can't say I'm unhappy about that.

For the week I stayed in Vegas, I came here twice. This is saying alot since there are so many restaurant options to choose from on the Strip. Here, the prime rib is a must try. I order it rare and mooing. It came out tender and very flavorful. All their entree comes with a soup or salad. I opted for their salad with house Italian dressing. Their Italian dressing is one of the best I've tasted. I wanted to drink it like a shot with what I had left after finishing my salad but decided against it. The second time I came, I had the surf and turf, which was an 8 oz. sirloin with butterfly battered shrimp. Very tasty. 

Now the service is not the most friendly here and keep in mind there is a strict rule that they do not allow separation of the bill. We wanted to separate our bills but they said NO EXCEPTIONS! If you do want separate bills, I'd suggest to go as party of one and request to be seated next to your friends. This is a loop-hole that I thought might work. Maybe...maybe not.

Originally we went for $6 steak dinner (not on the menu) and $1 draft beer. Since then, prices have raised- beers are now $2\/pint at the bar, and $2.50 at the table. I in no way believe that's expensive, just pointing it out. Also- the steak special is now $12, unless you have a coupon, which you can only get if you have a player's card. With the coupon it's $9 or so. So keep that in mind when you come. 

Honestly the steak is pretty good but on our last trip, we ate here two times and I got different items instead. Once I got the chicken and rice pilaf, I can't remember the exact name. It was excellent- sauteed chicken breast, spinach, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms on top of pilaf. It also came with salad. The next time I got ""no carb fried chicken"" which is just fried chicken without breading, and I will say that this made me rethink fried chicken completely. It was without a doubt much better than most fried chicken I've ever had, specifically because the skin was able to get very crispy not being battered, and the meat was incredibly moist and flavorful due to the skin being on. 

We've definitely had some colorful visits here, and sometimes the food has been not as good. The steak can be chewy and tough at times, and once my father literally choked on it (like, there was a line of people giving him the Heimlich maneuver). However I think he blames it on his lack of chewing, not the food, since he happily returns here for the steak. I realize that's a bizarre endorsement but hey, it's gotta count for something. Our most recent visit, it was right after my birthday and right before my mother's birthday and our waiter brought us a free slice of their chocolate cake. Normally I wouldn't care much about free chocolate cake, but this was fantastic. It was also made in house and really made me see their desserts in a different light.

The casino itself is kind of depressing.  It reminded me of a Lucky Lil's (a casino\/convenience store chain) that you would find in rural Montana.  Or maybe a older, run down, tribal-owned casino somewhere in the Midwest.  I don't know - just depressing.

The walk from Bally's was long and hellish (yes, I'm talking to you, mentally unstable guy talking loudly to yourself), but we thought we'd walk a bit to build up an appetite.

We also saw some poor bastard drive his car over an abutment right in front of one of Las Vegas' finest.  He ripped up the undercarriage of his car AND got a Dewey.  Daily double!

I was about ready to abort the visit when I smelled the ribs.  Oh.  My.  God.  Those ribs smelled awfully good.  Unfortunately it was too cold to dine outside, so we found a table inside (which was...depressing).

The ribs were pretty much outstanding, the beer was cheap, and our party of two got out of there for $32 (includes $8 tip).   Cheap.  The ribs had a lot of sauce on them, much of which I was wearing for the rest of the evening.

Theresa B. took me and my friend here to try their cheap bbq. It definitely did not disappoint! The servings were huge! 

The first time we ever came here (which was sometime last year), we were so hungry that we couldn't wait 1 1\/2 hours to eat their bbq, so we ate their steak special at their other restaurant. It was alright for the price (I think it was something like $7)

But..if you really have to come here...you have to eat their bbq! Expect long waits though (at least an hr to eat here). The best time to come is right when it's open at 4pm. They have four different items on their menu:

Full rack of ribs ($12), 1\/2 rack of ribs ($9), 1\/2 chicken ($8), and 1\/2 chicken & half a rack of ribs ($9) ---These prices are only if you have the Ellis Island Players Card. Don't forget to join, as members will save $3 per item!

WARNING: HUGE SERVINGS! I had to share my 1\/2 rack or ribs & 1\/2 chicken with a friend!

Each of the plates also comes with several sides: 2 corn cobs, coleslaw, baked beans, and 2 pieces of garlic bread! SO MUCH FOOD!

You cannot get a better bbq deal than this anywhere!

Btw, they also brew their own beer and root beer. The rootbeer isn't that bad either, and costs $1. Their beer is $2.50. They brew hef, red, dark, etc. 

Hours for this bbq place is 4pm to 10pm.

$14 for a meaty full slab of quality tender pork ribs with your casino card. $18 without the card. $12 if you get chicken & half slab of ribs. The chicken is very filling so i prefer the full slab of ribs to not be bloated. You don't really need the card because they usually charge you the lower rate without showing it.
Plate includes 2 fresh corns, cup of flavorful beans, 2 toasted french bread slices & a delicous cole slaw.
$2 for a soda. So $17 per person is a great price for such an awesome meal.
This place is next to the sportsbook. Hours are 4pm-10pm M-TH, 4pm-12am Fri-Sat, closed on Sundays. If you arrive after 3pm make sure to get a number at the Cafe to the left. Get in line & when it's 4pm they will call numbers so you will be seated promptly.
Service is very fast if you arrive early on weekdays. You will have your food in 5-10 minutes! This is the best place for ribs in town!",1,0,0

I've never tried the food here, and quite frankly, after the health dept. came in and had a few choice words, I'm not sure I want to try it anytime soon. 

They have basic table games--blackjack, dice, and roulette. The gambling is always fun with super cheap minimums (and also very low maximums). There are plenty of slot machines for the homeless to blow an entire day's worth of begging on which definitely happens on a daily basis here.

The food was delicious, but when it came time to get the check the waitress said that a new policy had been implemented where they don't split checks.

I had come here to meet a complete stranger and when I was told I'd have to split the check (not pay for mine and he his) I was really uncomfortable. We both only had credit cards and my meal was more expensive so I was totally against this person paying for any of my meal (for other reasons).

The waitress went and got the manager while the person I was dining with had gone to the bathroom. She immediately asked in broken English 'Where he go?' I was like, why do you need to know that? She kept pressing until finally I said, it's not really any of your business, but he went to the restroom. The next question in the interrogation was 'who paying for this? You must pay.' I thought I misheard her just accuse me of trying to steal, but she repeated it and I was sure then that she thought we were going to walk out on the check. 

I have never been accused of trying to walk on a check before (especially when I'm sitting there with a credit card in my hand), and I never will again because I will never go back here.

Here's an old school Vegas joint with some killer prices and decent food.  Yes, the $6.99 steak special is a great deal.  The steak was cooked perfectly and had not a sliver of fat on it.  It could have been served in a fancy restaurant.  Note to all: their temperatures are a little redder than you may be used to.  Medium is pink all the way through here.  Medium rare is very red, and rare looks up at you dolefully, moos, then slits its own throat.

The attendant sides are not that great.  Vegas is a land that loves neither fruit nor vegetable.  Don't expect anything great there.  However, Vegas does hooch very well, and they brew their own beer at Ellis Island.  It's extremely tasty and cheap!

Ellis island is a short drive from the main vegas strip, on a side street. Upon our arrival, the host greeted us and took my phone # down so they could text me when our table is ready, how convenient!

The prime rib was HUGE! It was good, but I've had better as far as taste goes. It wasn't tasteless, but wasn't the best I ever had. But the portion size for $16 is a great deal, especially in comparison to where I'm from (Hawaii) where it would probably be double in cost. The meal comes with a soup or salad plus choice of one side and green beans. I love prime rib but was only able to finish half my plate, my husband only finished half of his too. Next time my husband and I should just share one. Lol.

I stumbled upon this place on my last trip when I had a huge craving for ribs and searching yelp led me to this place.  Before the 4pm start time, a line has already formed for the barbecue place.  There's no menu but all I wanted as ribs.  For $8.99, the half rack + chicken special just can't be beat.  Sodas are also only $1.  

The ribs, while they are not perfect, are very, very good and better than any buffet quality that I've had in Vegas.  

One of the tricks I've realized is that they purposefully force people to wait for a bit.  This weekend, we were told that there would be a 30 minute wait but when we got inside, there were tons of empty tables.  They must be doing it to encourage people to play at the slots or tables for half an hour beforehand.  Oh well.  

The last thing I should mention is that while it is off the strip, it's actually pretty walkable back to the main strip.  About 15 minutes or so?

Upon entering this casino, I was surprised to see the number of locals to tourists ratio, more like 95% locals and 5% tourists.

We were seated quickly at around 6:30 pm on a Saturday night. We decided to come early as other Yelpers mentioned something about a long wait here on weekends.

We had a very friendly waitress, Lori, so mingled with us and was more of a motherly figure. I got the $10.99 King Cut Prime Rib w. a salad, string beans, mashed potatoes w\/ gravy and an Onion Rings for an appetizer.

The Onion Rings and salad came out quickly and were very good. The Prime Rib was also very delicious as well. At $10.99, it also came with a FREE beer, or Root Beer! :D

The Prime Rib is on par w\/ House of Prime Rib in SF, but w\/ 1\/3 the cost.

The good. 
The drinks are cheap. Karaoke is fun. The regulars are cool and supportive. This is a great place to go if you want to do something different in Vegas. 

The bad. 
The alcohol experience is NOT consistent. The waitress told me they didn't have Bud Light and a few hours later someone in my party got served one. WTF
When your waitress takes her sweet ass time getting to you, you can't go to the bar to get your own drink. They will turn you away and tell you to wait for your waitress. WTF
They over carbonate their home brewed beers so you WILL get a stomach ache. This is total BS. 
The girl running the karaoke runs it like a Nazi on speed. She constantly is dancing and singing the songs but if you do anything like stop singing or whatever she will start slamming things and yelling ""Sing! Sing god dammit!"" And then chastise you. She did this to me because at the end of my song I thanked the crowd for being awesome and thanked the bar for being cool. Once she did this I turned to her and said ""Go F yourself"" and walked off the stage.  I seriously think she was on a log of drugs. She also made a long ""2nd grade teacher yelling at the class"" speech about how this is the best karaoke bar in the world and everyone needs to recognize or they should get out. What an ass. WTF
There is NO BATHROOM IN THIS PLACE. You need to walk all the way to the back corner of the complex. WTF
And Finally - good luck finding your song in the karaoke book. Roger Miller is under M - Steve Miller is under S. They have more Steel Dragon songs than The Monkees.

I wanted to like this place. I really really really did. Given the rave reviews about this place, I was really excited to check it out, but I did keep my expectations realistic.

This place was really close to our timeshare and it was a 5 minute walk (in the Vegas cold cold night to get there). I was excited to see the $6.99 steak special.

Stepping in, this place had that dive seedy feel to it. Got our table at 4am and wanted to eat. So me and my 4 friends ordered (I got the steak special that was supposed to come with a beer), and it took 20 minutes for our salad and soup to get off. Seriously?? 20 minutes? How hard is it to ladle in some soup into a bowl, throw some salad onto a plate and bring it out? OK fine, so 20 minutes, we thought well hopefully our dinners will come out a little faster. Oh noooo, that was not the case. Another 30 minutes of staring down the waiter and asking him to follow up on our orders (and it wasn't even busy that night, he was waiting 4 tables) and the food finally arrived. We were famished so we all decided to dive into our food. Low and behold, the food was COLD!! Like cold cold! Rubber cold eggs. My medium steak was so overcooked, I thought I was chewing cardboard. We all had maybe 5 bites of our food and we just gave up. I really wanted to run into the kitchen to check on my suspicions of the chef being a one armed, drunk, retard.

Worse thing (well personally). They charged me for my beer that was supposed to be included in the special. I mean, it was just $1.50, but if you advertise the free beer with the special, then you should honor it. I was too fed up to deal with this place to argue the case. In the end, I paid 10 bucks and I felt like if I would have flushed that 10 bucks down the toilet, it would have been more fulfilling. The bill came to be $35.60 bucks or so, and we left $36 and got the hell out. 

We weren't the only ones that were complaining that night. Some people were sat at a table and no waiter came by for 20 minutes. They just left. The guys next to us were bitching about the same things we were. Another table straight up skipped out after a waiting.

So we weren't the ones frustrated with this place. That $6.99 thing must be the only thing they have to lure customers in, otherwise I don't know why anyone would ever come here, because I know I'm not coming back. Not even on a drunk hunger driving night in Vegas.

1.5 stars, I'll give the .5 star to appease those who swear by this place.

The menu was extensive.  A lot of choices like Pastas, Prime Rib, Chicken, Salads, etc.  The price was cheap too.  It was like $12.99 for Prime Rib..Great Deal!

My friend got the King Cut Prime Rib ($12.99).  It served with baked potato and beer or Root Beer.  I got the Grilled Chicken with Portobello Mushrooms ($8.99).  The mushrooms were cut in slices and served with spinach and rice pilaf.  

Both dishes also served with choice of soup or salad.  I think the soup was much better than the salad.  It was clam chowder for that day.  Very creamy, lot of clams and flavorful.  

I did not try the Prime Rib but the sides were delicious and fresh.  The chicken was so juicy, tender and not dry.  The mushrooms were flavorful.  The portion was very generous too.

Now I concede- if you're paying $5.99 for breakfast, don't expect Gordon Ramsey fare.  I came here because after 4 days of paying obscene prices to eat a meal on the strip (e.g. $5 for A SLICE of pizza), my pocketbook needed a break. Moreover, after my class I wanted breakfast, and it was after 11 AM on a Saturday.  Now in New York you can get breakfast 24\/7, no problem.  & GOOD breakfast at that.  On the Vegas strip you better get breakfast by 11 AM, and brunch fare is very limited.  I don't get this in a non-stop party city like Vegas that you can't get breakfast anytime of day any day of the week, but at least on the weekend. Smdh, but I digress.....

So my son found this joint that serves breakfast until 2 PM, & I really, really liked the prices.  It's a decent walk off the beaten path, and hence can feel a little unsafe.  But being from Brooklyn, it takes a bit more than that to scare me, but I digress.... Moreover, if you're from New York City you know: sometimes the greatest tasting food comes out of the biggest holes-in-the-wall; look at this Caridad restaurant by Woodhull Hospital in Bushwick, or Angie's Breakfast Spot also in Bushwick.  Anyway, I kept an open mind.

You have to pass through the small, dingy, smoke-filled casino to get to the dining area.  Mind you all public spaces in New York indoor areas, and even some outdoor spaces, are smoke-free & have been so for many years, so I am unaccustomed to eating around smoke.  As the dining area was not enclosed, the faint odors of tobacco is always present everywhere, including the dining area.

We had an expected 30 to 40 minute wait, and was seated about 45 minutes later.  My son ordered an egg white cheese omelet.  Problem #1:  egg WHITE.  I ordered safe: bacon & eggs.  Can't mess that one up. Our food came within a reasonable amount of time. What they gave my son was some round, pancake-shaped mass of (WHOLE) egg with 2 slices of what looked like Kraft cheese singles on top (!) (?).  So essentially he didn't get what he ordered, but I was not surprised that they would not understand how to separate out the yolk, and would not be the least bit surprised if they never ever had a customer request egg whites (only). & what the hell, a cheese omelet with the cheese on the OUTSIDE??  I cannot make this stuff up... Good thing he also ordered French toast, although I don't think that was anything to write home about either. 

Now my food was just that: scrambled eggs, uninspired but tasty enough albeit slightly greasy bacon, these weird potato things that taste ok\/pretty good (probably microwaved from frozen), and toast that was heavily buttered and textured like styrofoam.  

I get it: my breakfast was $5.99, and the whole bill with drinks and extra sides was $23 in total (I almost always tip 20%).  It wasn't like Wolf Gang Puck was back there slinging hash, but like I said before: in New York you can get some absolutely delicious food that is super cheap, so cheap you can feed your whole small family, and it's like you're stealing it-- you know what I'm saying"" like a whole steamy, juicy, tasty rotisserie chicken from the Dominican Spot with Arroz y gandules or frijoles and\/or Maduros for like $10.  And you leave the table rubbing your belly like, ""Damn!"" Swearing you're not going to eat for a year because you ate long after you were full because the food was That Good.  And you don't have to go to Gordon Ramsey's Steak either.  

Anyway, my point is that the dining experience was blah at best, more like peculiar, and just nauseating at worst.  It wasn't that the food tasted bad, but was not enjoyable. & although you do get what you pay for, that certainly does not hold true necessarily with the New York dining experience (& so I am a bit spoiled!).  Much better food can be found at IHOP, and even Denny's I'd bet, for a few extra dollars.",1,1,1

Polar opposite of a lot of the places you'll find inside the larger casinos. 

The only thing I don't love is that they allow smoking in the lounge, but really that's just Vegas for ya. I'll be back to Ellis Island in the future.",16,8,12

I just had eggs with potatoes and toast, and for $3.99 its as good a simple breakfast as you could get anywhere else. My husband had their ""special"" which was steak and eggs for $5.99, plus their house beer for $2.

Bathrooms were way on the other side of the cassino from the karaoke bar.

We came here on a recommendation, and honestly, the yelp reviews aren't terrible; which is surprising.... Cheap beer goes a long way in the review department I guess. 

So let's start with the beer.... It should be cheap, it's really bad.  The stout almost turned my stomach, it was sour.... not at all typical of a stout.  I don't know if it was a bad batch or dirty lines, but it didn't seem right. 

Moving on to the service... Good luck getting a beer if you are playing at a table.  The cocktail waitresses appeared to be more interested in mingling with each other at the bar than taking any orders.  I asked another staff member is servers come out to the tables, he said yes and he would send someone out.  20 minutes and a about hundred dollars later (I dare you to try to win a game in this place), I leave the table and go to the bar myself.  I place an order with one of the cocktail waitresses mingling at the bar, she says she'll bring it out.... She does, about another 20 minutes later. 

Just in case our experience wasn't already lame enough, keep in mind that through all of this they are almost dead in there, I sit at a slot machine briefly to get an Uber.  Someone comes over to ask me to leave the seat because it is for active players only.... I get it and I don't.

The craving has never been greater after one failed dining experience 2 nights before at the 'R' restaurant.  On our way to the Venetian, we stopped here for our late lunch.  

The casino is very small.  I think the restaurant took up 40% of the whole place.  However, people are very friendly.  It has that neighborhood restaurant feel to it.  The carpet is dingy, but since it's open 24\/7, it'd be hard to try to clean it.  

Anyway, I didn't have to think about what I wanted to order.  Both my fiance and I ordered the Steak Special for $6.99. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/EAwh1OmG6t6p3nRaZOW_AA?select=nmhASW6s6tvE8en_VMKPmQ
It came with a soup or salad and beer or root beer.  

I ordered my steak medium.  It was grilled to a perfect pink!  The steak was juicy and tender.  OMG!!!  This was the no B.S fine piece of cowboy goodness 10 oz of meat!  The baked potato was really good, but the green bean was too soggy for my liking.  

You might wonder if it was so good, why only 4 stars?  Well, I liked it so much I went back again just before leaving Vegas.  And this time, the steak was a little over-cooked on the outside and under cooked inside.  

For its inconsistency, I averaged it to 4 stars.  But seriously folks, for a complete meal (serverd 24\/7) at $6.99, you have to come try it!",5,2,4

Nearly an hour and a half and there wasn't anything else to do but be cramped in a tiny, smoky room filled with slot machines. Wait you say, how does this make it a 5 star review?

We were seated and promptly, the waiter proved his amazingness by taking our orders quickly and oh, he KNEW what we were there for.

Steak quality: Mine was bloody and perfect but the other gals who ordered medium rare had varying degrees of pink. Sad face!

Well, after being disappointed that all the steak specials in downtown Vegas end before midnight, I ate some shitty greasy pizza and that did not satisfy my craving for drunken steak. 

So after partying all night, I woke up still craving a steak special and headed on over to Ellis Island! Keep in mind this is slightly off the strip and a dump, so do not by any means expect the flashiness of newer Vegas. 

The $7.99 steak and beer dinner is a secret menu special, which I don't get why but whatever. I don't care much for beer and I had had enough alcohol the night before, so I got a little fancy and went for the $10 steak and shrimp special. My special came with steak, fried shrimp, mashed potatoes, green beans, and a salad. The salad sucked!!! The Italian dressing was really oily and the salad tasted not so fresh. 

My steak and shrimp however were so good!!!! I asked for medium well, and I definitely got it. The mashed potatoes and gravy were also delicious and went great with the steak and shrimp. I tried the beer that came with my friend's steak specials, not so impressive, but then again I don't like beer, so don't listen to me lol. One of my friends steaks was not so great, he asked for well and I think got medium, which he was not nuts about. 

I just read there's $10 rib and chicken special!!! That's enough to bring me back!!!  Not gonna lie though, the service is kinda shitty, so I think overall Ellis Island gets 3.5 stars.

The Chinese cafes around here offer $5 steaks and that comes with pasta, steamed veggies, soup and salad. I guess in Vegas, $6 steak is a big whoop so I landed here with a large group around 4am after a night of partying.

Our server was nice and patient. I ordered a medium rare steak with over easy eggs. While the eggs were cooked perfectly, my steak came out medium well. The steak was too dry. I was not going to send a $6 steak back at 4:30am so I ended up putting a lot of sauce on it to make it palatable.

The worst part is the asshole security guy who was rude to me. I walked in with my shoes on and took them off under the table because I had been wearing them clubbing all night. He was reprimanding someone else who walked through the casino barefooted and saw my feet under the table and started pointing at my face and raised his voice at me to put my shoes on. I, remaining true to my nature, gave him some choice words about his rudeness and utilized appropriate profanity to make sure he was clear about my anger level. Luckily for him he backed off before I went even more ape shit on him.

The BBQ menu is pretty basic. Baby back ribs and chicken, and combinations of those two. I went with a full rack of Baby backs. The plate was huge when they delivered it, with a side of corn on the cob, root beer baked beans, coleslaw, and some rolls. Plenty of food for $14.99. 

The ribs aren't smoked over an open fire, or at least didn't taste like it. They were tender, meaty, and good. The BBQ sauce is pretty basic with a sweetness to it.

The karaoke DJ was very cool though and managed the queue very well, always updating the crowd with who is coming up next to sing.  You basically look up the song you want to sing from a binder and jot down the artist and title on a slip and hand it to the DJ.  And best of all, it's free!

They had some really talented singers that night so the wait time for me to sing, while long, wasn't too bad since I was entertained.

Tried their Monday Music brunch. Although the singer had a pretty voice, the music was waaaaayyyy too loud, and I like loud music, but I could barely talk to my mom over mimosas. It was oddly shrill and lackadaisical keyboard covers of current songs- it was just kinda hit or miss and wah-wah-wah, but I was in the mood for woo-hoo. I think acoustic guitar instead of keyboard would have been more pleasant. 

The service was strange, rushed, all over the place. The brunch options were limited to just a few, and although we saw others dining on what appeared to be dishes from the restaurant next door, our server assured us that we could not order those on the karaoke bar side. Weird, since it seems they share the same kitchen? 

The bottomless mimosas were fine, but our server continued coming up to our table as we had half a glass left and asking if we were ready for another... but when we said ""sure"", then told us he couldn't bring them while we still had drink left in our glass. Weird; is mimosa-shaming a ""thing""? He did keep them coming though, as we finished, but it was just a lot of weird interaction, unnecessary because he also literally asked us every 5 minutes if we were ready to order food. Annoying. When we did order, my Eggs Benedict were cooked past an inch of their life, like way out into the dry desert deathlands. Wah!!! That was so sad, a poached egg cooked like that is a crime against chickens and humans alike. The hollandaise was shiny like plastic, and the olive on top made them look like 2 little plastic boob mounds with olive nipples (sorry, it just did). OMG, please change that plating- seriously. From the looks of the dish, I decided requests for changes would be futile, and picked at the muffin underneath. My mom's mushroom quiche was gray and she fiended eating it (politely, since I recommended we check out this brunch) probably thinking the same as me, futile. 

Here's the deal, we know Ellis Island is known for its value in food, gaming and drinks- but we were drawn in that day from the large cute ad in the Weekly and if they are spending the time and money to promote a good idea with the Monday Music brunch with a half page ad, c'mon and back it up with some well-executed basic brunch dishes.

1. I hate to be rushed (no one was waiting around for a table, I assure) 2. Sins against eggs. All in all, it was a BOOZY brunch, with a little saucy English muffin mixed in  3. Try their Steak Saturday night deal, because- well, Vegas - and be patient about it 4.

I got the steak special - a 10 oz filet with a salad or soup, green beans, choice of potato and a beer for $8.99 if you have the coupon (it's $12.99 without). I didn't realize we needed to have a coupon so our waiter went looking for one and gave it to me (score!).  Hubby had the final two B's in his dining trifecta - beef & bacon (the 50\/50 burger with ground bacon and more bacon+ cheese on top). He had my beer since I don't drink beer.  My meat was perfectly cooked, the green beans were fantastic, and the burger....I will never eat a normal burger again.

Total damage for this meal: $18.54 with tax and alcohol + and iced tea.  I threw our waiter a significant tip for hooking me up with the coupon (basically I gave him the difference in price in the two plus what I would've normally tipped).

I heartily recommend this establishment. Life IS great at the Super 8.  It's how seedy I remember Vegas being prior to being taken over my rich beautiful young people who have shitty taste in music (EDM) and who feel then need to coin the term 'Day Clubs"" rather than night club because God Forbid you have to wait until dark to party!

And now I have to close my eyes because I have a food coma starting.",3,1,2

before unlocking the steak deal at this place you need to sign up for a membership card at the casino.  they need your id and a pin number you're going to use. the ellis membership has two benefits.  it'll give you cheap dinners and also it'll give you 25 bucks of free play once you spend 10 bucks on any slot game.  not too shabby of a promotion if you ask me.

once you get the card, you need to go to another machine and print out the 9.99 coupon for the steak dinner.  (if you play 5 bucks on the card, you can access another 2 dollar off the steak dinner, effectively dropping the price down to 7.99)

we got 2 steak dinners with veggies and mash potatoes.  i also got an hef to wash everything down.  the hef was 2.99 and it came in a decent sized glass.
the steak was actually pretty good, and so was the mash potatoes. i added extra A1 sauce, but technically you could do without.  the veggies were a little over salted, but meh.

so keep in mind, a cheap steak dinner awaits you not too far away from the strip.  you'll just need to sign up and get that coupon.",10,1,3

Getting to our rental at the Wyndham so late that we opted not to drive anymore that night (btw: pushy, rude staff at that place).  Not quite knowing where to head (too late for a big buffet for me), we got on yelp and decided to try Ellis Island which was just an easy walk up and over one block.

the hotel for this joint is the next door Super 8, so that should tell you a lot right there; it is old-school, semi-smoky, and very small; you can walk around the perimeter in 5 minutes (if you're walking slow!); very little to recommend this place except 2 things: eating & drinking!; the Cafe specials are legendary, and they also have a Metro Pizza outlet which is basically just a counter and some tables, but it's hard to beat their quality vs. price ratio on pizzas & strombolis; best of all, they make their own beer here, and it's $2 per pint - yep, that is not a typo - you give the bartender a $10 bill, and he gives you a full pint of amber, stout, pale ale, or whatever, plus $8 of change - it's crazy!; best craft beer bet = well, ""craft"" beer might be a slight stretch, but they only serve their own homemade juice, and it sure beats macro-beer Bud\/Coors\/Miller swill; did I mention it's only $2 per pint?",1,1,0

This is a great hidden gem in heart of the Las Vegas! The food is a throwback to what Las Vegas dining used to be 20 years ago - cheap, good food and great value. It's about a block walk from the Flamingo on Koval Lane. The café is located inside the casino. Though not the fanciest, it's clean, cozy and staff is friendly. 

When we got there, a cocktail table was setup in front offering customers made to order bloodymarys for $7. Oh Hell Ya! It was simply too hard to pass up. We got a couple of them and they were delicious. It was the perfect situation while we waited for our table. A few sips in and our table was ready. The breakfast menu was presented to us which was pretty basic, but offered all the essentials breakfast items, including steaks, pork chops and chicken fried steaks. We ordered the steak\/eggs ($7.99), corned beef\/hash ($6.99) and French toast ($5.99). Our meal didn't take long to arrive and everything was on point. The steak was prepared perfectly medium, juicy and so delicious. Good thick cut portion, not the thin cheap kind either and more like fillet mignon size cuts. French toast was excellent, fluffy, thick and dusted with powdered sugar. Portions were more than enough to share.

Ellis Island might not be an oasis for foodies, but if you're on budget and want something satisfyingly good, than I highly recommend you check them out. Definitely looking forward to coming back, especially for their beers, $2.50 (20oz glass) which they have brewery on-site.",4,2,6

You also get two small ears of corn, bread, cole slaw and beans.  Not a bad price for the amount of food you get even though it went up.

The food is still amazing and worth stopping in.  This is a local place and when not real crowded, you can survive here without being smoked, meaning when you leave you don't smell like smoke.

This must be a different one than the Steak special from friends Dmitiy S. & Nina Y.'s reviews because it did not come with beer, salad, or mashed potatoes, but rather eggs, potatoes, and toast. Also, the steak was cooked more on the well side when ordered. Typically I get medium rare, but this time I ordered medium and it was more medium-well. Just a tad crispy for my liking, I still really enjoyed the steak for the value - a good 8 oz.

Seriously??  Yes!  

For the price, the steak was great!  Of course not like you'd get at a top end steak house or anything, but it was thick and tender.  No complaints there.  The fries were typical steak fries and the veggies were green beans.  No complaints about them either.  I got the soup, which was clam chowder that day.  Really good soup.  Nice chunks of clam and potatoes, perfect with some tabasco.  Finally, the root beer was great.  None of that Barq's crap here.  Home brewed with a good taste, more like a sarsparilla.   

Definitely my new favorite cheap eats place in Vegas!  Even state line\/ Primm doesn't have cheap steak dinners like this anymore.  Trust me, we went to all 3 casinos there on the way to Vegas before finding out they don't offer it anymore.  Take the signs on the 15 down then!

There is a 9.99 steak special that no one else in the area can touch as far as quality per price. The steaks are legit. This isn't like dining hall food or something ghetto like that. You even get a beer with your meal. 

The best part is that you'll have a lot money left over for that expensive buffet you might want to splurge for. 

So here's the downers. Everyone knows about this place so the line is pretty much in effect at all times. That's bad enough but then look around and you'll notice the caliber of people that are waiting with you is not exactly Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.

I'll start with the food. The barbecue restaurant inside Ellis Island is AMAZING! For a very low price you get a half rack of barbecued ribs that are addictive (my mouth is actually watering now just from thinking about them), as well as the best cole slaw I have ever tasted, 2 corn on the cobs, 2 garlic breads, and beans. I don't like the taste of their beans. They really are quite nasty tasting. I think they should just use canned Ranch Style beans. I always ask them to substitute the beans for more cole slaw. 

Then there's another cafe inside that serves AMAZING prime rib at a low price. This prime rib is so good! And it's HUGE! Good luck trying to eat it all. 

There are also other food places inside that look fabulous, but I haven't tried yet (I can't get past the ribs and prime rib).

They have their own brewery that all of their taps are hooked directly into. For $1 per beer, you will be amazed at how good it is. They also make their own root beer. I hate root beer, or should I say ""hated"" root beer, until my wife ordered a huge glass of it and insisted that I taste it. Now I order it every time I go there.

They have karaoke every night at 9pm. I love to sing, and enjoy watching the others go up and sing. It's set in a cozy bar with picnic tables. It's impossible to be antisocial there, as you are always sitting next to a friendly group of people who are smiling, drinking, and just having a great time. 

Gambling at Ellis Island is way different than gambling at other places. Where else can you play craps or blackjack for only $5, day or night? Their dealers are fun and friendly. I've had Marilyn Monroe, Celine Dion, and yes, Elvis deal me blackjack, only to jump up on a stool and start singing hit songs. They're all really great singers and entertainers, but I have to say that Celine Dion is AMAZING! I literally felt like I was at a concert. 

Ellis Island is a special place. It's right off the strip and usually filled with locals. They play excellent music, have exceptional food, and aren't out to take your money. If you lose money gambling there, you feel like you've paid for a really great time.",0,1,1

I might have a dislike for it because this is the ONLY place my parents wanted to eat at cause it was super cheap, but when I'm on vacay, I want to check out as much as possible.  Nonetheless, I had to be a jerk and tell my parents every time NO and that me and the hubs were gonna go somewhere else.

The one time we did go was after a showing of the Phantom.. I usually don't get too snobby about decor and upkeep in a dive restaurant, but when you go from the gorgeous Venetian to Ellis Island you are going from Ghiradelli to Aldi brand--and man Ellis Island was looking a little on the drab side that evening.

Anyway, lets get back to the food.  I actually didn't want the steak special, but was craving some Italian so I opted for the Chicken Parm -- not only did it come with a side salad, I also got pasta and garlic bread, and I think it was only $6.99.  Glass of wine was CHEAP too, I think $4??  Not the best food or wine around (was actually on the watery side) but what else do you expect with those kind of prices?

I just recently tried their cafe and their 24\/7 steak special is my new favorite thing. For $7.99 you get a decent steak, potato, veggies, bread, AND an EI beer or hard lemonade. Definitely worth trying out if you're on a budget like I am.

After a dismal fail on the part of Benihana at the hilton the night before, we asked a cab driver what was a good place to get a steak in vegas and he told us about Ellis island, so off we went the next night.

The place itself is on the whole, completely unimpressive.  Old decor, run down tables, and plugged with ripped red vinyl.  It kinda has the feel of what you would get if you crossed an old folks home for cigarette smokers with a casino.  At 36, I was well below the average age by a couple decades.  Not exactly ""happening""..

Anyways, during the long wait for our table (suprising considering the number of empty tables at the restaurant) we attempted to order a beer at the bar but got yelled at by the bartender for apparently daring to tread on the oh so sacred ground of the ""server station"".

B$%## bartender aside, the hef was delicious - I don't normally go for foofier beers like that, but it really hit the spot, and at 1.75 for a 20 ounce microbrew, you just can't go wrong.

Once we got seated, our server didn't really speak english, but that was fine since apparently nobody orders anything but the prime rib there anyways.  I ordered my prime rib rare and it came out damn near still cold, so I was happy with that aspect of it, but I was not happy with the fact it was about 60%fat and gristle, and only about 40 percent actual meat.  The others at my table got better cuts tho, and hey, for 13 bucks including a 20 oz beer, you can't really complain.

I want to thank Yelp for finding this gem for us! I was looking for a brewery in Vegas and found Ellis Island. 

I did not go into the café, instead my wife and I went directly to the bar where we proceeded to order $1.75 craft beers. That's a damn good price for anywhere, especially Vegas.  Their beers were good, I wouldn't say great, but definitely better than your standard mass produced you find everywhere around Vegas. The bigger plus is that when you are in the casino area and gambling, these are the beers you are comped! So yea, it's not as glitzy as the bigger casino's on the strip, but you get better beer! 

We also had an order of the Bacon Cheddar Sliders. WOW. These were fantastic. They were juicy, full of flavor and cooked to perfection. If you like dry burgers or food that isn't messy, these are not for you. The juices (not grease) dripped off them when we were eating them, so you had to be careful not to get it on your clothes.

The steak dinner comes with a slab of steak, your choice of potatoes, eggs, and toast...all for $5.99. Did I mention that the steak wasn't chewy and pretty good? Yes. All of that can be yours. I also ordered a beer which was surprisingly priced at a whooping $2.50! They're practically giving away food and drinks here.

Yes -  they have a steak special .....
Yes - they have ribs .....
Yes - they  have that old style vegas feel .... sort of

but then again .... many, many other locations in Las Vegas have similar specials, with a much better atmosphere.

Try Ellis Island:
If you like your clothes smelling like a cigarette factory .....
If you like derelicts sitting at the bar next to you ....
If you like service that is super slow ......
If you like bathrooms that look they were cleaned a month ago .....
If you like a security service that is totally useless .....

Is that the old vegas feel you want when you get away from the strip ??

Perhaps my feelings are clouded by the fact I got my wallet lost\/stolen at the bar in Ellis Island a few years ago.

You come here for the low prices, not particularly the food quality and especially not for the service. The steak and egg special (not on the menu, you have to ask) used to be $4.99,  then $5.99 then $6.99 now it's $7.99 and you have to sign up for the players card and then print out a coupon. Ok whatever, not a deal breaker, but the way we were treated a few nights ago did it for me.

Like I said before, don't come here at night, and I should have taken my own advice. The place is more than half empty, but still we were told to take a number and wait. There were two parties of two ahead of us. They were seated within minutes. Then I noticed a couple that came after us were seated before we were. So I got up and asked the hostess. She said she called our number already, but we must not have heard her whisper it, bc we were sitting on the benches in the waiting area, right on front of her, and the place isn't big. I told her I was sitting right there. She says, were you sitting there, or there? Pointing to the two benches right next to another. Why would it make a difference anyway?

So we get seated and wait. And wait. And wait. Then the waiter comes by and takes our order. I say all my please and thank yous. And smile. There was a table of old retired cholos behind us. They were done and waiting to pay. They waited for ever to get their check, and forever to get their slips too. In the meantime, a party of old white people ordered and got their drinks, and later their food. We also notice another table of old white people who were sat after us, got their drinks already after they ordered after we did. At this point were still waiting for our drinks to come. Mind you the place is pretty empty and its the one waiter working this side of the restaurant. It's been about 20 mins since we ordered and not even our drinks! Wtf. At this point we got up and just left.  It was very clear to me who they wanted to serve there and who they didn't.

I'm never coming back here again. Btw they don't do take out. If you ask they will just roll their eyes at you, say no and then walk away from you. But if you sit down and order way too much food, they will give you a to go box.  The Filipino waiter told me this. He was nice. Him and the petite Asian waitress.

A busy small casino with a decent atmosphere. Laid back with an older crowd. From time to time a liver singer would come out and sign at the Casino. Join their rewards membership (free) and you can redeem some coupons at the kiosk right next to it. I was able to get a free drink (they brew their beer and also root beer. $2.5 value) and a top sirloin steak dinner for 9.99) 

Even if you don't get those coupons you can get a better steak cut for only 15.00. 
Great service and friendly crowd. 

The sirloin itself was ok, they did overcooked my medium so you may want to order a level lower to get what you want. The salad was OK but their mash potatoes was amazing.

Also really liked the root beer that they had as well. 

PS. REALLY CHEAP bottle of water for only $0.75!! Couldn't find any cheaper bottle of water anywhere else. Get the water before asking for the bill.

I give it five stars for its ""dive"" and dingy appeal, unpretentiousness, great beer, even greater root beer, and reasonably priced comfort food. 

I'm a casino employee (not at E.I.) and embrace the kindheartedness of E.I.'s daily graveyard special...casino employees drink FREE from 3am-8am!!!! As if the prices of their cocktails, homemade beers, domestic\/import beers weren't cheap enough (and they are)...they go ahead and give a hand out to the honest casino employees. 

Drinks are good here with an emphasis on their homemade beers. If you prefer a non-alcoholic beverage, I can reassure you many Yelpers and I will attest to their homemade root beer. It has a very nice smooth carbonation to it, with a slightly sweet and bitter taste, and classic root beer scent. 

Food at E.I.... Upon sitting down, you will be served one dinner roll per person. However, beware of ordering too much! The appetizers, salads, and entrees are huge! We ordered: 
1) Two E.I. root beers 
2) Buffalo chicken wings w\/mild sauce on the side (the sauce was so tasty but the wings were a bit on the small side) 
3) Chicken Parmesan sandwich -- BF ordered this 
4) Chef salad -- me 
My salad was huge, like Cheesecake Factory salad-huge. All of the ingredients were fresh and, unlike most restaurants, they do not skimp on the julienne cuts of deli meats and cheeses. I got the 1000 Island dressing which was totally delicious. I guess it's because they make all of their dressings from scratch there. My BF's meal came with a small (normal sized) dinner salad w\/a delicious French dressing. He commented that his sandwich wasn't great nor bad....just ehh. It looked like it was nestled on a ciabatta roll with a nice portion of chicken, cheese, and sauce. An older gentleman sitting near us ordered the special that night, roast pork dinner for $6.99. Oh my god, I don't think three people could've finished that plate. The food was literally piled 4-5"" high! If he had a small child behind that plate, I wouldn't have known it from my point-of-view. 

Our first dining experience at E.I. was very cool and laid back. The service was good and friendly. Luckily, we arrived at about 4pm, so we were seated with no wait. As we progressed through our meal, a small crowd of people began to form. As I saw it, their staff accommodated and sat each group quite quickly. Their restaurant system seems to be a well oiled machine. 

I hesitate to recommend EVERYONE to dine here because the atmosphere is not for everyone. Because of the portions of good food, cheap drinks, and gambling the tiny casino\/restaurants (yes there are two ""sit down"" restaurants here) tend to attract some less desirable folk. The decor of the establishment reminds one of the 70s and the air does contain smoke. You will hear hoots and hollars, slot machine rings, and depending on the time of day you may visit, karaoke. So remember these factors before you decide to dine here. This is NOT an establishment that is trying to lure you in for its luxuriousness, theme, or glamour. It's a great and reasonably priced place to get away from all of those above!",1,0,1

Turnoffs include the long wait and the ghetto casino.  But its not their fault if they're popular and I'm not there for the casino--so these aren't deal breakers for me.  They're also generally understaffed.  Maybe thats how they keep costs down?

Drop by if you want some great ribs and want to do Vegas on the cheap.  Just get their early to grab a number!

I've been coming to this dump (and I mean that in the most loving way possible) for a quality steak and beer brewed on the premises for at least 10 years.

Those days have come to an end.

You can still get a better steak than you'd expect in a somewhat run-down coffee shop that's just a little too far to be walking distance off the Strip, but you now have to work for it a little bit. Step 1: sign up for the players card. Step 2: play at least a dollar with the club card. Step 3: go to a kiosk, swipe your card, and print a voucher for a $8.99 steak & microbrew. Then go eat. 

On my last visit I hadn't known that the off-menu special was now off the off-menu and the waitress was kind enough to give me an extra voucher to use, but you can't always count on them being able to help you out. The meal is worth the extra hoops to jump through. If you're not a drinker, you can get a house-made root beer in place of a microbrew. 

The EI also has cheap pizza, cheap ribs, and a cheap steak and eggs special if you don't want to deal with the players card. The restaurant is frequently busy because it's cheap and good. But the place is a total dump. You won't impress your date here.

The mile high nachos ($8) were more than enough for three people. Scoops of chili, a pile of beans, sporadic sprinklings of jalapenos and scallions makes for a filling appetizer. 

Slight misunderstanding about chicken fried chicken and fried chicken occurred which started souring the night. Our server was getting frustrated with our large party and was not trying to hide it. Due to the dispute, slight arguments were springing up. After reading Nelson Q.'s review, I stuck to my request for fried chicken. It came out crisp and the batter was not too thick. I hate cake like batter and this was thin and flaky. I asked for the honey, but realized that maple syrup was what I should have got. :( This is not the best place for large parties especially if cash is not in hand.

Despite sitting down starving (hadn't had much of anything to eat since 11am) I still couldn't finish off the plate which still had 2 ribs and the chicken breast still leftover.

The steak was pretty delicious and tenderly cooked to my medium-rare option. Is it odd to say that I'm ""an egg person?"" I'm pretty much a sucker for anything egg and a fan of the runny yolk, on the top, side, or bottom of my food.  The 'taters were crispy golden brown and tasty. The sourdough bread toast (drenched with buttah) hit the spot.  So seriously.. $4.99?

I know there are tons of places on\/off the strip for cheap steak, but this is by far one of the places I can agree for its mind-blowing value. You can also opt out the egg, for a ""steak dinner"" - $6.99.

Oh yes, this place is also a brewery, so our order of house Hef was $2. My mimosa was  $5 and it was kinda huge.

So.. our 4 steak orders and 2 alcohol drinks under $30?

Cafe was nice but on Christmas day at 10:30 PM they ran out of prime rib! Manager overheard us ordering and came over to inform us. What the heck! (reason for minus one star .. plus waitress was kind of rude but it was end of her shift I think and she wanted to be rid of us.)

""This is the tragedy of our trip."" -P, my partner. And yes, yes it was. Their WORLD FAMOUS EGGNOG, however, was amazing. I hate eggnog and loved this. Probably because it was spiked.

Food was good anyway but gambling is where it's at at this tucked away spot not far from the strip. Did I mention FIVE DOLLAR blackjack ALL DAY LONG? Yes! $2 min on bubble craps. We definitely came out ahead and it was a nice short drive to the flamingo.",9,7,9

We went for the steak & eggs - excellent!  Very high quality food, and outstanding service - the managers would walk around, and enjoyed interacting with the employees with smiles, and even a hug here and there.

Upon sitting, my group of 8 people all ordered our respective 5.99 steak deals. Took at least half an hour for the plates to come out and when they did, two orders were messed up. 

Service aside, the steak was very good for 5.99. Not gourmet stuff but extremely good for 5.99, especially with the eggs, taters, and toast, which was particularly good\/buttery for some reason.

Service was better the second night I came, we were seated immediately and food came out much faster. Guess service is hit or miss! It wasn't crowded either night.

This is our go to place for steak and eggs. I've yet to find a better deal that doesn't require you to go at odd hours. No having to wait for the midnight special. Gotta love that!

The service is friendly. The wait can be long depending on when you get here. The longest we've waited was probably 45 minutes. Our last visit, the service wasn't so stellar as they server didn't even bother to check in on us and refill out waters. She also practically took the cash from my hands while my companions and I are still figuring out the bill. 

So the brewery part, I've only tried their rootbeer so far and I must admit that I love it. If you're used to commercial rootbeer, this might not be right for you.

Yes, please.

The mashed potatoes rock, but they generally serve this plate with those green beans you can tie in a knot and they don't break, but they have no problem giving you a substitute. I always opt for corn, because you can't really mess that up. But, the taters 'n veggies don't really matter here, people. It's the steak. It's a bargain deal, and it's actually quite good.

They have a lot of other good stuff on the menu, too, like sammiches, chicken fried steak 'n eggs, a teriyaki grilled chicken breast, all reasonably priced. The service is, well, they take your order and bring you your food when it's ready. But that's just fine with me.

The food was great! Especially the prices! $12 prime rib dinner is an amazing deal.

We had the best time at their karaoke bar. It's small and pretty packed so it forces you to make friends with your neighbors. It was mostly the same 6 or 7 people singing and they were all very good! I usually hate listening to karaoke but I was amazed by some of the voices here.

 I've been wanting to check this place out for a long time because I've read a lot of great reviews about it on Yelp! When I found out I could get a hook up at Super 8 I was so stoked because I knew it would be so easy to come here. (right next door)

They have karaoke in one bar room, a cafe in the other, and a middle bar that surrounded by their main games\/tables.

Located just one cross street from the strip you can't beat the feel of older town vegas, with the prices and deals this place provides. There is also a Metro Pizza located inside the casino open during the day which a HUGE local favorite spot around Vegas.

From reading the reviews, I was expecting an older hotel. Once we arrived, sure thing the place smelled of old cigarettes and mold. After we got used to the smell, we ventured in looking for this ""steak house"". When I found it, I noticed it was a cafe and not a steak house at all. We got a number and waited about 5 minutes before we were seated. 

What's funny is that while we were waiting we noticed some other younger gentleman using their phones (noticed Yelp app) and I over heard them saying ""This is the place?"" I found it amusing.

My party was already laughing at me for finding this place, and even funnier is that an a hour earlier we were seated in a 5 star steak house having appetizers.

We got seated and I told my party ""please order the prime rib or BBQ ribs, that is all that is popular on yelp."" Against my advice 1 ordered a steak special and 1 ordered a chicken wrap. Two of use ordered the Prime rib (so glad I did). We also ordered some an appetizer entree that consisted of 3 Wings, 3 Onion Rings, 2 Potato Skins, 2 Chicken Strips, and 3 Cheese sticks. When they came, they were pretty greasy, and expected as much.

I want to note that the few waiters we had were awesome, and made the trip even better. 

Once the entrees came, the Prime Ribs were awesome for the price. They were juicy, had flavor and big portions. The other 2 entree's weren't that great. The chicken wrap was average and the top sirloin was over cooked in certain places and under cooked in certain places and had no flavor. The mashed potatoes tasted like dirt, so glad I wasn't the one that ordered it.

Wait is that even possible? Well People of YELP I am here to declare that this place is the shit. The Brewery is where the best thing you can get is their ribs. You must must come here for their delicious ribs for about $10 that comes with sides. 

I can say I was a little skeptical at first but when i got there based on their line to get in, I knew it has to be super duper great. The place does have odd hours so be sure to check that out. Also I believe they just opened for one minute and the place was fulled. Luckily I didn't care to sit at the outside patio. Sweet got a seat.

I was drooling over the ribs being cooked right in front of me. I couldn't stop looking and just wondering a rack of ribs can be so tender, so sweet, and so fully of juicy greatness. 

In the end I wished I had ordered more just to take the rest back and eat later. I kow some complained about the service. I have to say that I was just lucky! My service was excellent. The ribs and chicken deal is a good deal. I really liked the chicken also. I was really surprised because I'm so use to dry bbq chicken but someone must have known the secret to cooking chicken here. Thank goodness for that. 

Althought the chicken and ribs deal has variety, I kind of wished that I only ordered the ribs because damn I got to say that things was just so freaking orgasmic. ha ha.

No... you've decided to be the hot one and call me out, keeping my babies of steak & eggs away and needing to sell out $12.99 for some even at 3AM?! You've just gone mad now. You've changed. WE'VE CHANGED. And now you've gone way too far.

I found a new one to spend my nights of meat cravings elsewhere. One that understands me and knows I want a $4 steak deal after getting a little bit tipsy.

It's over.

Love,
Andy

PS: You were never that good anyway. I've had better meat in my mouth...",3,14,1

I didn't know this until I got there, and they're only $2!), and cheered the Bruins until halftime!

It's a pretty chill casino compared to all the hustle and bustle of the strip. The bartenders were nice and accommodating in changing the TVs for us to watch the game.

We went to meet a few friends on the ""$5 steak and a beer"" night, fully expecting swill and shoe leather, and ended up having about an hour to kill due to late friends. So we bellied up to the bar and enjoyed a few beers while we waited. 

Pros:
 - For the price, the dinner was actually pretty darn good. Steak, potato, and green beans and a beer. Nothing was spectacular, but nothing was bad, either.
- My husband's request for a steak ""as rare as you can legally serve it to me"" was actually honored! Quite frequently, places like this serve everything at a chewy medium well. Ellis Island actually served all the steaks at our table the way they were requested. This is the big reason for 4 over 3 stars.
- The beer was actually good! All of the different varieties actually tasted different.

Cons: 
- It's an old, small, casino. So it's smoky as heeellll.
- Service was pretty slow, but considering how packed the place was, and how obviously hard the servers and staff were working. I was still happy to tip well.
- The atmosphere is a little on the dim  and depressing side.",0,0,0

The interior of the casino isn't great either and the restaurant looks a bit run down, but don't let that fool you. The food here is decently priced, good portioned, and pretty tasty.

The host seated me quickly and provided a menu.  Table service was decent though certainly not as prompt as I would have expected.  No overall complaints on the service provided, though.  I just find when I'm by myself having breakfast that I prefer bar service (not available here) so that I can get in and out a little faster than standard table service (a little slow).

I'd originally hoped for the prime rib they had advertised but they had already run out for the day (which is completely understandable - it was about 4am in the morning after a busy Saturday night).  So instead I ordered the steak and egg breakfast combo.  The steak's flavor was really delicious - cooked perfectly (medium rare on my order) and seasoned very well.  The downside to it was that nearly half of the cut was extremely sinewy and nearly unable to be chewed.  The eggs were ordered sunny side up and delivered perfectly.  The order came with a side of toast and their breakfast potatoes which were both done just right.  Beverage service was pretty good about refilling my glass when it was empty.  Pricewise, the meal was very reasonable and I think that had I taken the time to get a member's card at the casino, I could have even saved more money on the purchase.

So the overall rating I provided is lower due to lack of service efficiency and the tough, chewy quality of part of the steak.  To be fair, I did not request a different cut of meat - I didn't want to wait for it, so I didn't give them a chance to correct the error, hence I didn't give too low of a review score, either.  I'd recommend going here and based on some of the other Yelp photos I've seen, I will likely be back to try stuff out.  Maybe the prime rib next time...",0,0,0

TASTE:
This time around I got the steak and eggs (when I was sober). The meat was overcooked. Next time I will definitely order it a little less under cooked than I want it. Eggs and buttered toast went Down deliciously. Sadly they wouldn't do take out so we couldn't bring food back for other people.
The steak speical with a beer is definitely worth it. I think the food tastes better when your buzzed or when your taste buds ae numed.  

SERVICE:
The waiter wasn't that bad. Just their no take out was a bummer. And our dd couldn't subsitute a beer for a coke. Only the root beer that wasn't very carbonated and was overly sweet.

If you are hanging out with your friends or family and want a good meal for a great price, Ellis Island is a sure winner.",0,0,0

We've been going to this place for years, namely for the $1 pints (I think they're $1.50 now, which is still super cheap).  They brew their own beer.  The Amber is my favorite...the light beer is not all that great.  Tons of gaming machines and a blackjack table.  Cocktail servers are usually pretty quick.  Also, they have a restaurant and a Metro Pizza in the casino.  Both are awesome.  The restaurant always has cheap specials, and the food is good considering the price range.  Metro Pizza always has slices ready to go, perfect after a ton of beer.  

Now, on to the karaoke bar.  I've been to A LOT of karaoke shows in Vegas, and this is by far THE WORST.  Somehow it gets voted ""best of las vegas"" by the RJ every year.  They are the only place I know of that has karaoke every night of the week, and I think that's their big selling point.  The sound quality is absolutely ridiculous.  The KJ never touches anything to adjust volumes or mic settings (by the looks of it, they don't even have the equipment to do so).  This ends up in not being able to hear some people, while the really loud ones (especially drunk screaming girls) are just so overpowering that it's annoying.  They have probably the smallest karaoke song selection I've ever seen.  There's no instrumentals or bumper music in between the singers, so it goes from super loud shitty quality sound to dead silence while waiting for the next singer to get up.  I was there 3 hours and sang 2 songs.  By the way, tipping the KJ does nothing at all.  No matter the offer, she won't bump you up in rotation even a few spots, or stay past the end time whatsoever.  ""November Rain"" by GNR somehow got cut from 8 1\/2 minutes to 4 1\/2.  Then during ""Sad But True"" by Metallica, I replaced one of othe lyrics with the f-bomb, and you would have thought I was a terrorist or something.  Security came up to me and said ""sir, did you see that lyric on the screen? No, then you need to leave"".  So, good luck if you want to sing songs like Cee-Lo's F-you, Tenacious D's F-Her Gently, Lonely Island's I'm On a Boat, or any of the adult parodies like Summer Nights or With Legs Wide Open.  I would understand if it were a family environment, but you have to be 21 to even get in the karaoke bar.  And it's shut off from the rest of the casino in such a way that you can only hear the karaoke from inside the karaoke bar area. 

I'd much rather take my business to one of the PT's Pubs karaoke nights, where the hosts are upbeat and they actually enjoy being there.  Also, the sound equipment is professional with a full mixer board for the music & mics.  And the song selection is literally 10X what Ellis Island has.  Sahara\/Decatur on Saturdays is one of my favorites.  In short, go to Ellis Island if you want cheap drinks , gambling, and good food, but STAY AWAY if you're looking for karaoke!!",0,2,1

I remember the days when these use to be $3.99, fast forward a few years...the steak and eggs are now $5.99. Just $2 more, but worth the price! If you go to Tuscany, their late night specials still include the steak and eggs for $3.99. 

My friend and I were on our way out of Vegas and decided to drop by. For a Sunday lunch, the wait time was 30 minutes. That's not a problem because we decided to hit up the slots! They will also give you a pager to notify you when your table is available.  If you open a new reward card with them, you'll get a chance to spin the wheel to see how much you'll get on free slot play. The range is $10 - $500, but I think everyone just gets $10. The machines are good for this small casino. They have some of the newer machines that you'd find on the strip. 

When we finally sat down, we placed our orders. I enjoyed my steak and eggs. I wasn't expecting anything fancy for $5.99. I also ordered some orange juice and coffee (the orange juice was awesome! freshly squeezed). Oddly, the price of the drinks was just the same as the steak and eggs, so my total was approximately $12 for the meal...not too shabby! 

Overall, I am giving this place 3 stars because it includes both the casino and restaurant. The place is off the strip, so it's attracting a different kind of crowd. Also, the casino was really dark. The restaurant offers good deals and that's probably the only reason why I'll come here again.",3,1,1

We eat by the brewery bbq, we mainly like to sit outside to dine underneath the warm fire lamps, the brick cobblestone ground, enclosed in with wooden fence and our noses are drenched with the scent of slabs of meat slow cooking and being grilled in front of you by their line cook. The ribs are so soft and fall off the bone delicious with their sweet & tangy BBQ SAUCE , I usually order an extra side so I can drench that baby. I usually get a FULL SLAB, and the portion is HUGE, I usually take half of it home! You also get 2 corn on the cobs a piece of bread and a side of bake beans all for $12.99 with your players card, it use to be $10.99 I think though when I first moved here in 2007. The only downfall is that you have to wait an hour , there was never a time I waited any shorter than that but its worth it if you want to get full and coat your stomach for some drinks and when your feenin for some ribs.

I also have visted the restaurant inside this tiny local casino. I order the KING PRIME RIB... DELICIOUS!!!! Their breakfast here is good too!

The casino itself is nothing to rave about it, unless you want to save on cigerettes by inhaling free second hand smoke.  Parking is scarce however, and can be a pain sometimes.

But the reason why I come to Ellis Island Casino & Brewery is for the food.  For the price they charge, it really is a steal.  Of the food available here, the BBQ is definitely the better option.  However, their regular restaurant selections are good as well.

I still have not been able to try their prime rib, as the last time I visited with my friends, who were in town for CES, the prime ribs were overcooked.  Our waiter told us unless we like prime ribs well done, it was best to try back another time.  So we ordered other stuff, and I think the best is their chicken fried chicken or chicken fried steak.   The portions are largeish.  Their house salad was good too, in a down to earth, diner salad kind of way.\

Beer takes the main stage here. This place has one of the best beers of microbrews anywhere. The amber ale I got was so nicely balanced. However, amble ale is hard to make, and sometimes they do taste over-roasted. The other killer beer is the light lager, which has such an intense smell and taste of sweet malt (for a ""light"" beer, no less). The hefe and dark beer are all really good (well, fresh hefe are usually good), but light lager and amber ale are always the first two I get.

What Ellis Island may lack in the big strip pizazz, it makes up for in charm and guile.  Cheap, delicious food, karakoe, and a super friendly staff all make for a great experience.  We were fortunate enough to meet Mike who was running the event we attended, and he was a total boss.  We were totally taken care of, and even obliged in our ridiculous scavenger hunt requests.  

I know that Vegas is known for good customer service, but I guess I just did not expect to be so warmly welcomed throughout my stay.  This event was just a great example of the kind of things I enjoy;  a backyard BBQ feel with a live band, great food, great friends, and a fantastic host.  I even won some money at the Blackjack table.  It doesn't get any better than this.

I booked an upgraded king which was refurbished nicely and got a room at the back of the hotel which was off the main road and quiet.

The coffee maker is a little one-at-a-time sachet thingy and there is a fridge and safe in these rooms too.  The bed and pillows were comfy. There is also a 24-hour coffee maker in the foyer that churns out good coffee.

I didn't go into the casino or sample any of the food.

The steal of the trip was the $6 shuttle back to the airport. It's a 3rd party shuttle and you need to give them about 30 mins notice but it was cheap and quick!",1,0,0

A random person from let's say, OC area would probably not wanna step into this place from first glance. We wanted to try this place out because it was recommended by a coworker.
It has the old school vegas feel - old slot machines, cheap tables (3-5$ black jack), one main bar with cheap drinks, and they have their own brewery. Their beer is ranked like #9 in the states. A glass of beer here is like $1.75, and they are just awesome. I tried their hef & stout, I even asked for 2\/3 hef, topped off with stout. After 2 glasses I was pretty buzzed!
We ate at their popular cheap restaurant. They have a large selection on their menu. With low expectations, my gf ordered their 6.99$ steak which comes with a salad and beer. She said the salad wasn't really fresh, and I tried her steak and for its price it was pretty good. It's like a steak you would cook at home without marinating at all, just the piece of meat thrown on a grill. I ordered their special, the pork pulled sandwich. The bbq sauce was pretty tasty and the pork was good. The bill came out to be like 16$, and our meals were very satisfying!
Considering the ridiculously low prices and all the good things that comes along with this place, they get a well deserved 5 stars! This run down gem of a place is definitely a new spot we shall stop by at least once whenever we are in the area.",1,1,1

This place was not your typical over-the-top fancy, prime-rib serving joint. This is the kind of place if you're looking for good food without the top dollar price. 

The food was delicious (we all ordered the prime rib with side salads and hard root beers) and for $15.99 it was hard to beat in Vegas - or anywhere - for that matter. While the main course was absolutely fab (side dishes were okay), and the portions were more than anyone could finish, you couldn't help but wonder if the low price of $15.99 for such a meal was them taking a hit on the restaurant to draw you in to gamble at the slots. Either way, it worked for us and we threw $30 into a machine on our way out.",1,1,1

Let's talk the food. I had the best country fried steak that I have ever had in my life. The batter was perfect and it was fried to perfection. My other relatives got the New York Strip and it was cooked perfectly. The service was awesome and it was a nice crowd. It was wonderful!

It may seem impossible that a place that serves up cheap, house-brewed beer can also serve up a quality salad, but Ellis Island does just that.

Yes, Ellis Island is known for loose slots, BBQ, karaoke and interesting characters, but I can't comment on all of those. I have cleaned my plate of their apple-pecan salad however, and it is good. It has real mixed greens which is notable because lately I have been going to restaurants that say mixed greens or garden greens on the menu and serve iceberg. This makes me angry. Here, they throw in apples, cranberries, candied pecans and a tangerine dressing. Clearly, you have a delicious green creation. It might not be hard, but plenty of places get it wrong. Plus, you get to enjoy it in a very vintage atmosphere. People don't mention it as much, but the restaurant has the heavy upholstered, red booths that make you feel like you could be dining in the 70s. I would say it is a pretty classic Vegas atmosphere, but not fancy for sure. It is old school in its own way.

As for the beer, 20 ounces for $1.75 and it is microbrewed right there. How can you complain? The El Wheat (their hef) is refreshing and an easy drink. They also brew their own root beer. 

I need to head back to try the BBQ when I am up for a meat fest, but for now, I consider it a Vegas institution, and given the unexpected salad find, I consider myself a fan.",28,8,19

I don't know if this listing is only for the restaurant, but the casino actually has a small bbq place as well. They only serve BABY BACK RIBS and BBQ CHICKEN (w\/ sides of course!).You can choose from a whole rack of ribs (11.99), a whole bbq chicken (6.99) or THE COMBO-- 1\/2 rack and 1\/2 chx (8.99). Both are delicious, but I have to say that the ribs are my favorite. the meat is so tender and juicy and the bbq sauce is to die for! They even give you an extra side already because they know that people always ask for more. If you sit outside on the patio, you can see them grill the meats right in front of you.

The humungo plate also comes with corn on the cob, bbq baked beans, and toasted bread. If you don't like one of the sides, you can ask the waiter to swap it out for another. I just went this weekend and the asian server actually gave me extra sides free of charge! Also, he gave my friend all the sides for free since she was the only vegetarian at the table. I've gone here a few times and other than the Asian male server, most of the wait staff are impatient and rude. You can't really blame them though since the restaurant is tiny, there aren't enough tables, the wait is almost always over an hour or two, and people are constantly asking when there table is ready. In any case, this place is DEFINITELY WORTH IT!! You can pass the wait time by gambling at their $5 blackjack single-deck tables.. you'll probably win enough to cover your dinner since it's so cheap! Oh, and if you like light and very crispy beer where you can actually taste the hops, then you must try out their house-made beer. It's only $2 bucks! 

I'm from Orange County, CA and I've made a trip out to Vegas JUST to eat at this bbq place (and to do the usual Vegas stuff of course). I'm not gonna lie, I pretty much signed on to yelp to write a review solely because I just took a bite of my leftovers right now. 3 days later and they are still melting in my mouth. MMM MMM MMMMM!!! :)

TIP #1: If you go with a big group, have someone put down their name first because you will be waiting for over 2hrs. They will give you a number and they call them over the loud-speaker so you can hear it wherever you are in the casino. Just don't be too busy gambling!

TIP #2: One order is definitely enough for one or even two (if you're with a bf\/gf) to share, but I suggest ordering one for yourself and saving the leftovers for later. They taste EVEN BETTER at 4am after a night of clubbing and drunken fun!",3,2,2

By the power of Yelp, we found something off-the-beaten-path that only the locals know about and a few tourists willing to venture out here. It's located just off The Strip, but pretty far enough to get away from the hustle and bustle of The Strip. 

This is old-school Vegas at its finest. 

The cafe is located on the corner of this casino with old, dark, rustic wood panels that reminds you of those classic movies from the 50's and 60's. It's definitely uniquely charming in it's own way. She ain't pretty, in fact she's pretty ugly...but beautiful nonetheless. 

Vegas is known for many things, and Steak & Eggs is certainly one of them. Wifey and I were looking for a late-night place to grab some grub and this place lit up as bright as all of Vegas' neon signs combined. 

How could you go wrong with a $5.99 Steak & Eggs special? You simply can't. This is unlike those $5.99 Steak & Eggs specials from Denny's, IHOP's and Reno. It doesn't even come close. 

So the special runs from 11:00 PM to 07:00 AM. It's perfect for a town that doesn't sleep. They also make their own brew.

The one thing I was not expecting from a joint like this was exceptional service. The place is not a dump, it ain't first class either; and certainly not a place where one would expect great service. Our server, Rosie, was superb. Loved everything about her, especially her English accent. 

Besides their $5.99 Steak & Eggs special, she recommended the Prime Rib ($13.99) as they only had a few cuts left and we better get them before they are 86'd. Wifey and I decided to share, and Rosie said that it comes with a 20 oz. beer. 

SOLD!!!

I ordered the 10 oz. Steak & Eggs ($9.99) while Wifey ordered the special, and the Prime Rib with a side of salad. Rosie threw in the soup of the day for good measure. This place did not disappoint one bit as the steaks were cooked to perfection with all the tenderness and juiciness one would expect from a medium rare steak. But I was in for another surprise as I cut a piece of the Prime Rib and the flavor just hit me like Manny Pacquiao's left hook. Rosie was right.

Service: 3\/4 - Depends on where you are. In the eating areas, service is a little slow. But if you are standing at the bars, the bartenders are pretty quick. Just hand them a few dollars, and they will set you up for the night! 

Food: 3\/4 - There are two different restaurants: one is a grill, the other is a cafe. Honestly, what you need to know for the food is simple. So I'll make this short and simple for you! There are exactly 4 food items you should be concerned about: 

1. King Cut Prime Rib (cafe) - 5 - Amazing and comes with a free beer~!

4. Rack of Ribs (grill) - 3\/4 - Not the best ribs you'll eat in your lifetime if you love ribs, but awesome for the price. Can sometimes be overcooked and a little hard.

Came at 10:20a and didn't get our food (party of 2) until 11:10a. We both got the steak and eggs special like most others.  You get your bang for the buck, but at the cost of customer service.  The steak was ok. 2 parties that came and ordered after us got their food first. It was obvious the waitress forgot our food.  A male busboy brought our food out cold.  We didn't get a chance to sit and eat and had to take our food to go as we had to check out of our hotel (mandalay) by 12.  It took about 20 minutes to get the check.  Ridiculous! But I didn't let one bad experience prevent me from returning.  The real reason I come here was for my regular, which is the prime rib special. From what I remember it was a 24hr special as long as they didn't run out of prime rib. It was not available at 10:20a (overheard waitress tell other customers it's not available to order until 11a) so we decided to come back again at 2a.  Sadly it was not available as they ran out before midnight. I guess this gem is no longer a secret local spot as now it is well known and they run out of prime rib (so now where do I go after a night out drinking?) I ended up getting the steak and eggs again and my boyfriend got the chicken and waffles. He wanted a soda so I told him to get the root beer. When the bill came, we were charged another soda for a refill. When my boyfriend asked for a refill the waiter did not say there were no free refills. When we asked about it the waiter said there were only refills on sodas and root beer comes from the bar.  I was always under the assumption that root beer was a soda but I guess not at this place.  So we paid $5 for 2 glasses of root beer. Definitely not worth it. Also, it took another 20 minutes to get the check and pay. When people are ready to pay and leave (especially after a long night), nobody wants to sit around waiting. The bad service along with long wait for the check was enough for me to say I don't mind not coming back here. I also wanted to mention that I recognize the same Asian (Cambodian?) lady that's worked here as long as I've been coming here and when we were tired of waiting to pay we walked to the front where she was she told us to go back and continue to wait for the waiter. She did not care that we've been sitting there about 20 minutes waiting for the waiter to return to pick up the credit card.  So for the people who don't believe in spending their hard earned cash for bad service, definitely don't come here.

I've been here many, many times since, and here is the picture I paint...this is a review of the bar and separately, the dining area at Ellis Island.  It is not a review of the separate BBQ area, nor the hotel (re the hotel, I have a separate review).  Although I gave it 3 stars, as you will see below, I really give the bar 4 stars, and the dining area 1-1\/2 stars.

Ellis Island is just one of the several Village Pubs that are ""all over Vegas"" (off the strip). The brewery is at this location.  Let's make clear which should be obvious, as a casino, this is a sub-par establishment, as will be clear, the only thing it has going for it, is the bar, the prices, and most of the food (as long as consumed in the bar area).

With regard to the bar:

It's open 24 hours but the best time to visit if you want a semblance of peace and quiet, is from 11a to 4:30p.  The beer brewed on site is good, 5 alcoholic and 1 non-alcoholic (root beer).  The IPA, Amber, Stout, are good, and the regular price of $2.25 for a 20oz is a true rare bargain, bringing back memories of the past--you don't need a coupon, you don't need to show a player's card, it's the regular price.  A flight is available for $6.  The bartenders are truly terrific, normal and unpretentious.  If you go to any of the other Village Pubs, the same beer is in the range of $4.50, still a bargain.  You can order food in the bar, but if servers are not available, you need to order at the bar.  The steak and eggs, steak ""deal"", and prime rib, are great., perhaps except for the former.  I will say that the steak and eggs, although they are the same price at all of the Village Pubs, are consistently better at the other Village Pubs around Vegas, not at the Ellis location.  Management of late has consistently been increasing the price of food, without any announcement (happened again in the past few days), so we'll see how long this long time bargain lasts...so far they have not touched the beer prices.  btw, on game days, beers are $1 each...

With regard to the dining area:

You'll likely have to wait for a table.  The servers and hostesses have no personality and are gruff.  While the bar setting has personality, the dining area is dark and dreary--reminds me of Binyon's.  I strongly suggest you eat in the bar area if that is available.  The food tastes better in the bar than in the dining area.  Bottom line, I'd avoid eating in the dining area.  Eat in the bar, or try one of the other Village Pubs around Vegas (be warned, however, the Village Pub at Terminal 3 at the airport has airport prices, it bears no resemblance to the rest of the Village Pubs around town).  My favorite Village Pub is probably the one on South Rainbow, but they are all similar except for that 1 airport location.

Bottom line... having patronized most of the Village Pubs off-strip around Vegas (excluding Ellis Island and the Terminal 3 airport location), I highly recommend them--the servers, bartenders, prices and food are good.  The big thing that Ellis Island, the Village Pub at that location has going for it, is the price of the beers, the bar area, and the bartenders in the bar area. Eating food in the bar area is a thumbs up.  Eating food in the dining area at Ellis Island is not a particularly pleasant dining experience, as the employees there, as in the rest of Ellis Island, including the hotel, are pretty darn unpleasant and don't know what a smile looks like. 

My rating for the bar area, because of the prices, the bartenders, and the atmosphere, 4 STARS; my rating for the dining area, 1-1\/2 STARS.  Here's hoping the management of this establishment doesn't lose the bartenders...they and that bar is the only thing that Ellis Island has going for it.",1,0,0

I came here last friday night thinking it would be super good since all the reviews here on yelp.  Aside from the super long wait for a table, you have to wait real long for your food too.  We waited about 45 minutes and had to leave cuz we needed to catch a show.  

After our show, we came back at around 11:30 pm, still had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  It's not like they didnt have tables, they were short staff i guess cuz the other section was closed.  I was disappointed by the food and the restaurant.  It's not worth the wait at all.

The wait staff are nice though...2 stars for the friendly waitress.",2,3,1

The front bar has Karaoke 7 nights a week until 3am and I really enjoyed it. I must say that the first couple of singers had dark sides to them...Sound Garden, Metallica, etc... I instantly knew this was not a happy let's sing pop and love songs kind of crowd. This was pretty dark hard core singing. I was just amazed that the screaming and voices were dead on. It was a little refreshing for me, then the typical singers I encounter.

The bartenders were a little disconnected. It seems like they were making drinks for other people outside the bar. There was a secret window where ""OPD"" went...what you don't know what that means? Okay fine ""Other Peoples Drinks!"" Now are you down with me? It was like you needed a road flare to get there attention and I was sitting at the bar. Plus there is a 10 buck min for a tab on credit card. Also do not start a tab with the waitress and then order a drink from the bartender because they do not work well together. Okay as I'm writing this sober I'm realizing this paragraph deserves like one star.

I need to get back to my happy spot...good cold fresh micro brew beer flowing from taps behind the bar. I wish the tap was on my side.  I also wish the bathroom was closer because I needed to return the beer back to nature. So I went on my walk through the casino. I loved it. As I walked around, I noticed 5 buck blackjack...it was over $25 back at our big casino on the strip. I love that these little places have low starting limits. If I was Mayor of Funtown I would make a law that said there will be no set table bets. Hey if I wanna gamble a buck why can't I? Why are you forcing me to lose more money?

I think this place is a find and I can hardly wait to come back here but I'm going to need to start working on some dark songs to sing or I might get kicked out.",7,6,6

Now that I'm a permanent resident of this little desert oasis I figured it was time to update just why Ellis Island is the best place to eat, drink, gamble, and sing karaoke in Vegas.  Here's the updated reasons in no particular order: Awesome (and I mean awesome) dealers.  The celebrity dealers are a welcome addition to an already skilled and friendly team of dealers.  They are there nightly and feature the talented & funny Barbara as Bette Midler, a suave Gary as Elvis, a curvaceous Dinora as Mariah Carey, Lynn with a heart of gold as Shania Twain, Karine as the blonde bombshell Marilyn Monroe (some nights she's Christina Aguilera but either way a hot blonde), and Kuki (probably spelled wrong) shaking it as Shakira.  If you like karaoke this is the place to come.  They have it nightly and it goes from 9pm to 3 or 4am depending on the night.  It gets crowded so get there early to find a seat.  Expect to wait at least 1-2 hours to sing.  It's that popular.  There's a wide variety of singers from awesome to just shoot me now but you'll have a blast regardless.  Ellis is right behind Bally's and a short walk from the Linq.  There's never a shortage of taxis in the parking lot either.  Do yourself a favor and check out Ellis Island!",0,0,0

We loved it so much we went back again - that's 2 out of our 4 nights in Sin City.

Ellis Island also has a pretty decent bbq - choose from ribs or chicken and you get more food than you can possibly eat.  Oh, and they brew their own beer.  We liked the light lager.

They have reasonable table limits so you can stretch your gambling money if you just want to play a little for a cheap price. It's not a big casino but they have all the major games covered.

I felt like we transported back in time but it was cool to go into a casino that still had that old school Vegas feel. We ate at the cafe and all had a big fulfilling meal for such a cheap price. I had the steak and eggs, ordered it medium and it came almost well done. Our food took forever and a day to come so there was no way I was sending it back and waiting for a new one. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy it. My boyfriend had the prime rib and he devoured it. The server said this was the best thing they had on the menu. My sister ordered the steaks and fried shrimp and her steak was way better than mines. It was a different cut from the steak that comes with the steak and eggs so that's why. I think it was a NY, or a sirloin, not sure. The salads that come with your entree are pretty damn good for a little side salad.

Cheap good dinner, cheap beer and a lot of great people watching. There is nothing like enjoying your meal and watching some really awkward and inappropriate flirting between the servers and lonely drunk men at the tables. There is karaoke that is dominated by some of the worst singers and you have a first class show from the dining room. And of course the icing on the cake is the Elvis impersonator. A tiny man in an oversize Elvis jumpsuit. Heaven!

Here, a steak dinner with a baked potato runs you $10 and comes with a beer or root beer (!!!). I opted for the steak and eggs for dinner at the same price, because Vegas\/America.

While hailing a taxi cab, our attendant convinced us to go to this place (instead of another we had in mind).  Big Joe told us it was the best place to get some steak and eggs.  Well Big Joe, you were wrong.

Granted, the food was decent.  The eggs weren't dry, and with a little salt and pepper, it made it just right.  Potato pieces always a plus.  I ordered my steak medium rare, which usually let's my meat be just the right texture - not too dry, and not too bloody.  Well, my meat was a bit on the dry side, so one can only imagine if I had even fathomed to order my meat well done.

Then again, you get what you pay for.

My main complaint about this place was the service we received.  After a long wait to get our food (maybe I'm too used to the fast service I get in California?), we finished our food, and waited for the check.  I guess I'm used to getting the check before I'm done eating.  But we waited.  And waited....................... AND WAITED.

We tried asking the hostess for the check, but she just rudely stated she didn't know who our server was, and she simply couldn't help us.  From what I could see, there were only two servers at the time, so how hard was it to figure it out.  If the first one said no, THEN ASK THE OTHER!  And yes, we did try to get our waiter's attention.  Luck had it that he was serving two large groups.

However, that is not an excuse for a good 30 minute long wait (or at least what felt like 30 minutes) for our check.

Ready to go to sleep, exhausted from a night of clubbing and suffering from a food coma,  we decided to do the right thing and leave money on the table before we left.  Yes, that's right, we never got our check.  At least we had the decency to leave money for our meal.  I know we could've just walked out and left, but we took the high road.

First of all, I am a vegetarian so I haven't had their steak and eggs, but my friend swears on the Bible on it. Says it's the best thing ever.

We went there for the traditional post clubbing meal. Imagine 6 drunk girls stumbling into a shabby looking casino\/restaurant at 4am talking obnoxiously loudly recapping the night. That was us. To anyone not intoxicated, we were probably annoying as shit.

I got the baked penne which was good, but in my drunken stupor, my stomach wouldn't let me enjoy it to the max (and I ended up throwing it up. TMI, I know) and the rest of the girls got the usual steak and eggs. Although they said it was a little over cooked, they did all agree that the clam chowder was frickin' amazing. Things like ""Best clam chowder EVAR!"", ""OMG, it's not even this good in SF"", and ""I want another bowl NOW"" were said during the meal.

Besides their food, what REALLY won me over was the waitress this last visit. Sure, it was probably our bad because we were annoying, typical girly Vegas visitors, and we were talking pretty openly about subject matters that should really not to spoken in public at high volumes, but when the table next to us complained to the waitress about telling us to shut up, she stood up for us. She said it's a public, open restaurant and it's freakin' 4am. Drunken, inappropriate talk should be expected and she really has no grounds to tell us to shut the eff up.

My boyfriend ended up ordering the pork chop dinner ($10ish) (includes 2 large bone-in thick cut pork chops, choice of potato (the mashed potatoes were killer!!) and a veggie (he got the corn) the pork chops were juicy, not dry and had a good seasoning and nice char flavor to them. hes a big eater and he couldn't even get thru half of his meal.

(their house ranch was really tasty) all for 10.99!!! overall we had a really friendly and efficient server and the food was very good, we both ended up taking most of the food back to the hotel and having it for lunch when we woke up the next day and it was all still really good. 

As for the casino, the casinos small and older. definitely seemed like a local spot and much slower pace. (it reminded me a lot of the casinos in mesquite) they only have a one craps table but my boyfriend was able to win back the money he'd lost while gambling on the strip, and the slots were that night were paying out pretty well. the casinos a very short walk if your staying at the flamingo\/ballys\/cesars area like we were and was nice to get off the strip and win some money and have a cheap meal! def coming back each time we come to Vegas in the future.",2,1,0

Tips:
-Gets busy so line up early!
-Get a players card, then go to the kiosk to get the coupon. Saves you several bucks!
-1\/2 rack of baby back ribs and 1\/2 chicken is delicious! With sides, all for $12
-Small place, kind of hole in the wall, not really there for the atmosphere, but go just for the ribs. 
-You can go to the cafe...but it's faster if you walk to the right of the cafe to where the BBQ only line is.

First off I'm hard to please when it comes to steak and eggs grave yard specials. Its pretty much a Vegas night out tradition for Vegans to go out & party it up and grab steak and eggs after. Like I said I'm hard to please, even at 3 in the morning with my steak and eggs but Ellis Island didn't disappoint. Every steak and eggs place I go to serves a steak, 2 eggs, some toast, and hash browns... ew. I'm not much of a fried food person. So I always ask for mashed potatoes, usually I get a no or my waiter gives me a hard time for switching out my hash browns for mash potatoes. Either telling me they have to charge me extra or just a flat out no. BUT at Ellis island my waiter started to say no but they said ""he'll see what he could do"" Which I thought was super nice because I later found out they don't make mashed potatoes at 3am LOL",2,0,0

Once the waiter came back I asked him what selection of beer he had and if he had anything similar to Blue Moon. He mentioned some beer and he walked away again. :'(. I gave up on the beer and decided to try their appetizers. 

I had ordered the Texas chili cheese fries, and the potatoes skins along with the chicken fried chicken. The chili and the cheese did not look appetizing and smelled kinda funny. The meet from the chili stuck to the cheese and was very awkward. The potato skins were salty, and kinda hard. The chicken fried chicken was AMAZING, but i was getting full from the weird appetizers from earlier.

Still being a Vegas newbie I have been finding a lot of places word of mouth.  This is the classic example of that.  Cue scene: Me singing and another venue and making new friends.  We realize that getting on stage again isn't going to happen, and inevitably, someone will say, ""Ellis"".  With nods, grins, and everyone quietly repeating ""Eliis"" in approval, I decided to follow everyone over there.

I loved how small the entire place was.  What I loved even more was the pricing of the beer-- $1.75.  The first time I was there I got the stout.  It was alright.  I'm very stout picky and prefer the imperial variety, but it wasn't bad.  The next time I got the IPA.  I haven't moved on.  It's the one for me.  If you ask for water, it's a bottle for $1.  One night they hassled me about a minimum to use  my card, and every other night it's been fine... so be aware of that.

The books are huge.  They have ones by song title and ones by artist.  There are also many other songs that aren't in the books, so you can always ask.  Also, everyone is pretty friendly.  You can always strike up a convo with people visiting or the regulars.  My only issue is the queue.  Most nights I have gone tended to be from 30 minutes to 90 minutes to sing.  A lot of times  I've seen people get up 5-6 times while others have gotten up 2 times even though they have songs in... and it's not like the it was a quality of singing issue.  It actually upset some of the patrons so badly that they started complaining to me about it (like I could do anything) then the host.  Maybe the 5-6 time people were big tippers?  Maybe people were getting irritable because they had been there since 10 drinking and it was almost 3?  I'm not entirely sure.  Maybe I'm too easy going to care.

With all that said, it really is one of the best venues for karaoke.  And as with all music and music venues, you can't really appease everyone.",0,0,0

The portion is very decent, it comes with a side of garlic green beans and your choice of baked potato, fries, and I think a few other things.  You get your choice of soup or salad. And the best thing for me is their house brewed root beer.(I'm not a fan of beer)  My Bf always goes for the beer since you have your choice.  Oh, and if you want to order another beer or root beer, it's only $2.25!

The service is hit or miss.  The first time we came here, it wasn't too good.  But the second time around, we had the same waiter and it was really good.  Now the only bad thing is the wait, sometimes it's long, sometimes it's not.  I believe it depends on what time you come and how many people are in your party.  We came the second time around 9pm and were told that it would be a 35min wait.  Less then 10 min later, we were seated.

True, they have a cheap steak dinner but you can get something equal to or better at most of the casinos. 

Ellis Island used to have a nice outdoor BBQ restaurant. Then they moved it inside and it's a pain to get into. You have to arrive at a certain time and get a ticket out of a machine. The restaurant is so small that it fills up almost instantly.

When my husband and I arrived at Ellis Island Casino and Brewery, we were not aware that there are 2 different dining areas.  There is a BBQ restaurant by the door and a restaurant towards the back of the casino.  

The BBQ restaurant is to the immediate left of the front door.  There is an inside and an outside seating area.  If it is really cold and windy outside, do not expect to be able to change your seating to the inside immediately.  The host will re-list you at the end of the list for inside seating.  Many tables of people complained and asked to be reseated inside but it was not happening.

The BBQ menu has two separate prices- it is cheaper when you join your player's club.  Just put your name on the list and go sign up for the player's club.  After 24 hours, they even give you a $10 match play.  The BBQ menu consists of a small menu or chicken, beef or ribs and the estimated wait for us was 1 hour and 40 minutes.  Get there early, place your name on the list and wait.  It will be totally worth it!  We were hooked and had to come back the next day to patronize the restaurant.

At the restaurant, the $6.99 steak special is served with a side salad and your choice of fries\/mashed potatoes\/baked potato was also worth the 40 minute wait.  We found the karaoke room by the restaurant and parked our asses in the seats so there was no temptation to keep gambling until your number is called.  Remember to ask for your dressing on the side, the kitchen just ladled a ton onto our salad.  It almost looked like a stew when we got it. 

While you are waiting, get one of their special brews for only $1.50 at the bar!!!!  The dark beer was one of the best that I have ever had and I managed to have 4 before I was able to be seated for dinner.  I am definitely coming back here the next time I am in Vegas.

The best deal in Vegas? I should say so!!!

This place is walking distance from the Strip, and a much better value than what you've find a few blocks away.  I was confused when I first walked in, and didn't know where the restaurant was. It's NOT the barbeque area, where the big vats of beer are, with only a few tables.  It's a more conventional restaurant set-up, on the other side.  They don't take reservations and there is usually a wait, but there's a casino to spend your time in.

TIP: Sign up for a player's card. You get $10 in free play that you can use instantly. My suggestion? Play something with a relatively high payout like video poker; as soon as you use up the promotional value, you can begin cashing out anything that you earn on top of it. You can easily earn about 75 - 80% of the comp play back at every Vegas casino that gives you comps for signing up for their player's card.

I didn't see any cocktail waitresses while I was there -- but with $2 (actually good) beers and special $2 cocktails, do you really need them?",5,1,0

The Ellis Island restaurant is the epitome of cheap but good eats in Vegas. It's located off the strip but not unreasonably far from the Paris\/Bally's area. We already heard about the great deals they had on meals but when we saw the sign for a $6.99 sirloin steak dinner with a BEER while driving into the parking lot, it was like a dream come true!

We eagerly waited for our number to be called while playing some slot machines and that only took around 35 minutes. The crowd in there was comprised mostly of senior citizens and families but we didn't mind! Our server, Jorge, was so wonderful and nice which earned him extra tip money!

Ok, so I thought that maybe my meal would just come with a dinky steak and a tiny glass of beer for that price but boy was I wrong! The meal also came with a choice of salad or soup, a side of garlic green beans, and either a baked potato, mashed potatoes, or fries. The sirloin steak was a massive 10 oz too!! That's unheard of! The beer also came in a tall pint size glass and I only drank 1\/4th of it. haha Jorge was kind enough to switch my amber ale to the light lager at no cost since it was too bitter...thanks Jorge!

First, the quantity of food is staggering - the dinner includes a soup or salad, steak, potato, green beans, and a pint of beer. The quality of food was actually pretty good, too. I really liked the cream of broccoli soup - which our waitress told us is made from scratch daily. My steak was pretty good, but a bit tough (though another person in our group ordered his medium-rare and really liked it). Mashed potatoes and green beans were also good. The beer was actually pretty impressive - the place is a microbrewery, so they offer their own ale, stout, hefeweizen, and root beer. Between the five of us at the table, we happened to order one of everything. The stout was really good - very smooth, the ale was also nice. If you're not in the mood for alcohol, the home-made root beer was soo tasty. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place!",0,0,0

the first time we came, the wait was so long and missed the BBQ special that ends like at 10pm, so we ate at the restaurant. I had chicken fried steak and the hubby had steak and we devoured our food. what do you expect when waiting an hour?!

it's also a very interesting place, while stuffing our face we encountered some old farts hooking up with call girls..Hey it's Vegas!

second time, we made it a point to come early for the wait and the BBQ special. again we waited like an hour and lost our money. ;o(
sucks losing, but i guess that's  how they make up for cheap Delicious meals.  we both had the special which included BBQ chicken, ribs, corn & BBQ beans...ALL for $8 bucks!

you  need to get the Players Card to get this deal ;o)

You'll definitely have leftovers, and this is where as I was walking back to the Flamingo with my very Delicious leftovers in my hands fantasizing about eating it later, a homeless man comes up to me\/my food and puts his hands on my box of leftovers and as we stand there with both hands on the box i look at my husband and he says "" Give it to him!"" i didn't want to, it was so good.

I LOVE dives and karaoke.  Do NOT take this 2-star as a misunderstanding of the function of dive bars or karaoke, and do not doubt my love of both.  

I got there with a big group of friends at midnight on Saturday (of Labor Day weekend), signed up for karaoke, and was told it would be about an hour before I could sing.  Sweet!  The bar and tables are CHEAP, so no problem there.

Here's my problem:  the karaoke MC is a douche. The bar tenders and other patrons in the bar were SUPER NICE, but yeah.  Here's what happened:

Like 4 times he said  ""We've got  [ so-and-so ] on now, then Genevieve, then [ some other name ]""   And somehow another name would magically get announced before mine.  I was ""next""  . . .  at least 5 times. It was only when one of my friends went up and asked if I'd ever get to sing that he FINALLY put me on.  

THEN I was holding my drink while singing (as I like to do) and in the middle of my song he yelled  ""Hey - set your drink down!""   Excuse me - I am busy rocking the house, which is what I did, thank you!

The ""Best of"" polls in the local newspaper mentioned Ellis Island several times, so I figured I had better check it out. 

Walking in, I could tell immediately that this was not the sanitized-for-tourists Las Vegas I was already acquainted with. Ellis Island was old and smoky as all hell. I stepped up to the bar to order a beer, where a lone bartender appeared to be serving everyone in the entire casino at his own leisurely pace. I waited for several long minutes before being acknowledged by the bartender, who told me that walk-up service was on the other side of the bar. The allure wore off quickly, as after swinging around, I waited for literally another ten minutes before placing my order. The only beers on tap were the ones brewed in house, and I ended up with an Ellis Island ""Dark"" and an ""Amber,"" both of which were good buys for a dollar but otherwise unexceptional. Drinks in hand, I looked for a table at which to gamble, but there was no craps at the time and the only active blackjack table was full. I gave up. 

In its defense, locals probably don't want to deal with the hassle and expense of the Strip. Ellis Island is accessible, and though I didn't eat here, the prices did look pretty great. However, the service was abysmal.  As a fan of good beer, I would have liked to sample the other brews to find a stand-out, but it would have taken far too long. Oh well.",0,0,0

A small and dark casino, which had more of a bar-like atmosphere.

In the back, there is this small cafe that's open 24hrs; a small diner feel. The service was sub-par; our waitress got one side dish wrong, took a while to get our drinks, and was hard to flag down when we wanted our check. Though this loud (and picky) table behind us was driving me nuts and probably making the waitress' job crazy. The place was cramped, with tables crowded against each other.

Ordered the $7.99 filet steak deal. The meal came with the choice of beer or root beer. When asked if we could substitute the drink, she said no (not without a fee at least). Really? *sigh* Aside from that, great value (also came with side salad and 2 sides). I ordered a Texas burger ($8.99), which only came with one side and no drink, so my meal ended up costing more than the steak meal. It's a large-portioned chili cheeseburger, and was decent enough. Should have got the steak...

A good bang for your buck, foodwise. I was expecting more out of this place though as far as ambiance and service. If you do decide to dine here, sign up for their player's card (other end of the casino) and get $10 in free slot play (for new members only).",1,1,1

My friend digs dive spots, and I don't have a problem with them ... but I was skeptical about the quality of their beer and tempered my expectations. Which was a good idea, because the beer was a disappointment.

They offer five house-made brews of standard varieties - Light, Amber Ale, Weiss, Stout, and IPA. I started with the IPA and noticed that it had absolutely NO flavor. How can an IPA have NO flavor? I thought maybe he poured the wrong beer, but I saw him pour from the IPA tap. Maybe the lines were mixed up with the light? This would have been acceptable for a light beer - it was crisp and not unpleasant tasting. Rather, it was just flavorless.   

After chugging it down, I went for the stout. This was a better choice, but still just an average stout at best. It reminded me more of a porter than a stout, and similar to Yeungling's porter. Acceptable, but nothing to write home about. 

My friend, like many Vegas locals, love this place. And I kinda dig the seedy, divey vibe as well. And he says their house-made root beer is outstanding (I have never tried it). But the beer was disappointing. If that was really their IPA, then they need a reality check on what a true IPA is supposed to be. 

If you're looking for a microbrewery in a casino, Triple 7 downtown is the way to go, not Ellis Island.",1,0,0

All I can say is that I would rather lose my $$$$ here than at the
'big name' casinos.   My money actually did last longer here than
at other casinos... luck?..maybe.   Small 'homey' casino.   Fun
place.  Older.  Not modern and glitzy.   

Good food here...that is a BIG draw for them.   $6.99 for a 10 oz.
filet mignon dinner????   I had TWO...yes, at once!   $14 bucks for
20 oz's. of Filet mignon?   Wish I lived next door to this place!  This
is an 'unadvertised' special.   You have to ASK for it....not on the
menu.   They also have some great prime rib for $12.99.  

They are renown for their home-brewed beers.   Since I am not a
beer drinker, I can't vouch for that but I know they have received MANY
awards.  

They also have awesome bbq.  We tried it one night... got there just
before they closed and was told they only had enough for FOUR
dinners..and we had SIX people!   Would you believe there were
left-overs after we were finished eating??   And we even had a few
big eaters!   Should tell you something about quantity.   Quality
was good too.  Ribs and chicken.   The chicken was my favorite....

They also have a ""Metro Pizza"" inside the casino.  I had never heard
of Metro before, but evidently a LOT of other people had because around
meal times there was a longgggg line waiting to order pizza or buy a couple
of slices.   I didn't get to try the pizza but it must be GOOD!!

Fun casino just a longgg block off of the strip behind Planet Hollywood.
The casino is hooked up with Super 8 motel next door....

Fun place with good food... how can you lose??",4,4,4

I think it's been said many times in the reviews that this place is a dive.  If you can get past that, the food is really good and cheap.  We ate many breakfasts here and one dinner plus one BBQ in the front restaurant..  Breakfasts are the best.  Dinners are good too but as the day wears on, the patrons get more and more ""interesting"".  We were a little worried about our car in the parking lot.  We were approached by pan handlers on two different evenings.  I love Country Ham. And the ham was so huge that it covered the entire plate of eggs, hashbrowns and toast.  I made two ham sandwiches with the toast (for later)and still had tons of ham to eat with the eggs.  My husband had the steak & eggs and raved about them every morning.  
    I want to say something about the BBQ up front.  The reason the wait is so long is because it depends on who you are.  We sat at the bar and waited for our number to be called while we watched locals come in and get seated right away.  I guess I do understand this (in a way, because they are loyal) but it doesn't seem quite fair.  My husband complained about it after waiting 1 1\/2 hrs and they seated us immediately.  We weren't really impressed with the BBQ.  Maybe we were just irritated and nothing would have pleased.  We didn't go back and probably won't next trip.

It's relatively small, and I believe this is because they don't aim to be a casino that wants to attract a lot of attention from the bigger hotels of the strip. The location is mainly because of how the area is a *tad* bit sketchy, but when you're in a group you're perfectly fine.

The best thing about Ellis is the cheap drinks, period. Also, the best thing is the tables. I've really enjoyed playing blackjack here on the tables, I've seemed to have gotten decent luck at them compared to the hotels on the strip and the local hotels.

The $6.99 filet minon dinner for which they are famous is not on the menu, ask for it directly.

The beer sucks, the rootbeer sucks, and the waitstaff is friendly though overworked, thusly, food comes slow (unless you're there at 3am)

Order your steak rare or medium rare, or else it will come to you as a charred hunk.

Bottom line: at 7 dollars, you can't go wrong, and the only real downside is the atrocious wait.  It is what it is, and there's something magically epic about a steak that cheap, in Vegas.  Don't come here for ambiance or quality, come for a cheap filet that might make you smile.",2,0,1

Prime rib (5\/5) - Very tender, juicy, thick,  and cooked medium rare just as we asked. Also comes with a 20oz draft beer for $13.99.

Steak and eggs (4\/5) - The steak was a tad bit overcooked and chewy but I wasn't expecting it to be the best cut for $5.99. It tasted like it was char grilled and was very tasty. Comes with eggs, potatoes, and toast. I did really like the fact that the cubed potatoes were deep fried and crispy!

TIPS:

1)  If you join the player's club they give you a coupon for an $8.99 steak special but this is only good at dinner time. So if you go during lunch time, don't bother getting the card and just go for the steak and eggs.

2) If you come at prime time, they give you a pager that will alert you when your table is ready. You can take it with you around the casino which saves a lot of time.",6,0,0

MAN WAS I IMPRESSED! i think they took the entire half of a chicken grilled and and neatly placed it on my plate! it was bathing in a rich white gravy sauce. it possible may have been swimming in it. it also came with a side of toast which was lubed in a sexy butter sauce, two eggs sunny side up to brighten up my day, corned beef hash (sunce im from hawaii) which were also in the form of disc and melted away in my mouth. and if that doesnt get you full theres also a pelethera of potatoes, like half a dish full to fill you up. 

Another plus side is the price. i paid like 13 bucks for the entire meal. I think it was the fullest ive ever been for breakfast! The place was pretty clean. The lighting was perfect. especially cus i had a wee bit of a hangover from the night before. 

The service was great. Constantly checking to see if ""everything is alright"" i love that question becuase it sounds like you could be in a situation where there is imminent danger when asked. Also my water was constantly being refilled and right after i was finished i was given time to let my tummy rest before being presented with the bill. 

All and all this place gets a 5 stars for great food quality, excellent prices, and great service. If you happen to find yourself half broke after a fun night of drinking, gambling, and partying then you should definitly check this place out, for a temporary hangover stitch! :D",1,2,0

BUT i read the reviews and saw that multiple people were happy with the food and the prices. 
We got here at about 10pm went up to check in with the hostess and she said it would be about a 30 min wait.... IT WAS EMPTY! There were so much workers and lots of empty tables, so we clearly didn't understand what the wait was about. We then gave her the number to contact us (they text you when your table is ready). 
35 min after the time estimated we walk up to the hostess and ask her why we haven't been seated yet, and she mentioned she DID text us 3 min ago, where were we??? GIRL we were on the seats in front of you don't front! Anyway bad experience with that. I personally feel they make you wait that long just so that you can gamble in their casino, which isn't that great, but this cafe makes up for that. 

FOOD: Of course one of us had to get the prime rib, my husband decided to get the prime rib and boy oh boy it was deeeelicccious! Cooked to perfection! The salad was great also and so was the minestrone soup. We also enjoyed the green beans perfect flavor and nicely seasoned. I tried looking for reviews on the pork chop and there weren't any, so here's my review for that! The pork chips were tiny but for the price you can't complain, I got mine with a baked potato so that helped fill me up. My cousin got the fried chicken something omg sorry I don't remember but anyway she enjoyed. If you come here and you love prime rib, don't hesitate like us, GET IT cause for $14.99 my husband loved it and I did too by picking off his plate lol.

An elderly man that asked kindly. I saw the two woman deliberately ignore him like trying to be funny. They acted as if he wasn't there. So the man embarrassedly walked away and the two hostesses began laughing as if it was a game between them two. Which angered me deeply. Poor man. I wish I caught their names.

My friends and I came here on a late Sunday morning after a weekend of, well, enjoying Vegas, and we were exhausted. Ellis island was a cab-ride away from our hotel which was on the middle of the strip, I think about $7 there with tip and then we walked back to the strip after our meal (maybe a 5-10 minute walk). 

We had to check in to get a number; the wait was about 35 minutes and we finally sat down around noon.  The casino itself was overly-smoky just like all old casinos in Vegas, and I was starting to get sick by the time they seated us.  Also, waiting in a casino- not always the best idea; I lost about $10 on the slots during the wait so in reality, I spent more than what I would have if we had a simple breakfast on the strip...

The food- great value for the price!  I ordered my steak medium and it was pretty decent if not a little tough.  I ordered fries instead of the breakfast potatoes for a little bit extra cost and eggs were scrambled.  I don't actually eat eggs, but I nibbled on them just to test- not bad. The size of the meal was decent- I left pretty full.   

Overall, I thought the food was decent and a great value but in the future, I might have to stick to the strip.  I'm not a fan overly-smoky casinos and the fact that there was no other casinos or attractions next door; I was smoked-out by the time we had finished breakfast.",2,0,0

I used to recommend Ellis Island ribs to EVERYONE coming to Las Vegas, but no more.  You guys absolutely suck.  

We went in with an 11 year old and her dad, the first time in Vegas for both of them, and the FIRST night in town I took them to ELLIS ISLAND.   

After an hour wait for a table, we left with an 11 year old in tears because they don't serve DINNER to anyone under 21, even with outdoor seating, and they don't offer take-out either.  No way for me to pull THAT one out of the bag.  We went to Margeritaville instead.

Way to ruin a vacation, guys.  It just wasn't that much to ask.

The casino itself is small, but varied, and there's always a few open spots. Slots, blackjack, roulette, you name it. My only reservation is that the roulette table seems a bit off-set. The histogram for the past 10 spins had like four 00's, and that's statistically unlikely with a properly-set roulette. The cigarette smoke also doesn't help with keeping the machines well-serviced.

Two reasons why this did not get 5 stars: one, it could be a little cleaner.  I really think they need to do some updating, but  maybe they don't need to because they are doing well enough without spending the money. The floor should have been swept before they seated us, and some of us had to get new silverware because it wasn't clean. Two, no separate checks.

There was a wait of about 20-30 minutes, so we sampled their beers while we waited.  
The AMBER beer: A strong hoppy taste, bitter notes on the finish. Not our favorite.
The WEISS: Favorite! :} I'm always a fan of wheat\/hefeweisen style beers, and this one was the best of their selection. Smooth, crisp with citrus notes and a pleasant overall finish. Served with a wedge of lemon. Best of the lot, but not anything worth going crazy over. 
The STOUT: Forgettable. Dark beer, but not particularly distinquished.   

+ For making their beer on site.
+ For big, tall, ice-cold glasses of beer being $1.75

When we finally got into the restaurant, we had our disappointment over the BBQ and then carried on. We started with their fish n' chips. Supposed to be one of their signature dishes, since way back in the day. The fish had a nice, greasy  beer batter and good flakiness on the inside. Comparable to anything you'd get at a Fish n' chipery in London? Definitely not. Still very edible, though. And the fact that it's served with malt vinegar, on a tray with newspaper, is cute and I appreciated that. 

After that came our main orders;

Salads first! Iceberg lettuce drenched in dressing. 2 smallish tomatoes each, tons of croutons. Meh, Bleucheese makes any salad edible, but not noteworthy. Came with stale looking buns.  

Steak  & shrimp: A surf n' turf. The steak was thin, gristly and overcooked. The shrimp were battered and fried to oblivion- burnt on the outside and were gross on the inside. The potatoes were most likely instant.

Rib eye special: Huge slab of pink,  tender juicy meat. Baked potato looked over-cooked and wrinkly. We still haven't touched it, days later, despite our best intentions otherwise.

The food was ok, but the only thing we'll go back for is to try the BBQ or karaoke and drink up some cheap beer.

The place looks like it hasn't been redecorated in a good 30 or more years. Cement floors, red vinyl seats, lots of wood paneling, cheap drinks - and the $6.99 special! The special is not on the menu, so you have to ask for it. Practically everyone who was dining there was eating it. They start you off with a basic green salad which is iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. Then they serve your steak with a choice of potato (I had mashed) and their vegetable. I was a little disappointed by the steak. I ordered mine medium rare and instead it was more like medium well-done. But for the price, I can't complain. The special also includes a beer since Ellis Island is also a microbrewery.

1. Amazing cheap food.  
2. Friendly, helpful staff
3. A combination of old and new machines
4. Lower limit blackjack tables with friendly dealers
5. Easy on-site free parking garage

I spent a lot of time here during my wedding weekend.  We had a number of people in our group staying next door at the Super 8 and it was always easier to gamble and eat here than going over to the Strip about a mile away.  

On our first night we realized how amazing the food was.  (Thanks Yelp!)   We ended up having the BBQ plate....10 bucks for a rack of ribs and a half chicken.  Wow was it good!   I had everything to eat here from pizza to their $7 filet mignon.  Sometimes the service was a little slow but they were totally busy and seemed understaffed and the wait staff was usually in an upbeat mood.  They did the best they could.  

Do not forget that $7 filet mignon...you can't at least get that once while in Vegas. For that price you also get a free root beer or regular beer.  Their homemade root beer is damn amazing.  You almost get drunk off the root beer flavor, its that good.

They really do have a great selection of machines here...everything from the old-school physical reel one-armed bandit style to brand new ones like Sex-In-The City and Monopoly machines.  (Watch that Sex-In-The City machine...its max bet is 6 bucks a pull!)

I played a good amount of blackjack here too...most tables were 5 bucks and the dealers were nice and pretty darn funny as well.  (No matter if you are winning or losing)

On my return trips to Vegas I will be spending a good amount of time here.

I have many a dilemma with Ellis Island. First off, the prime rib special there is excellent. The ribs and chicken combo at the brewery is one of the best deals out there. You receive free play instantly when you sign up. I lost a ton of money here. Okay let's not retread on the bad memories.

The food is what you get when you come here. The games have pretty bad payouts, and I don't remember seeing many people win here. The whole atmosphere is kind of sad and there are much older people here than some of the other casinos. Parking is abundant though, and signing up for a free player's card is easy and quick. I would say not to get the 10oz steak here though. It was the only disappointing food that I tried it. I asked for medium and it was waaaaay too well done.

i come here every time i go to Vegas cause i do like their food and service, but my last visit on Aug 20th around 10-10:30pm which i've even brought a group of friends (first timers) along to give this place a try. All i could say is they've ruined my night and humiliated me in front of my everybody because i've told them how great this place was and the way it turned out cause of her performance was just complete junk. 

i was a server so i pay a lot of attention to how servers perform when i eat out, our server was an older aged white women which doesn't matter cause what matters is how they perform, but she FAILED in every aspect of a servers minimum requirement.

here's her problems

1. wrong order (i could deal with that... who doesn't make mistakes?)

2. smile, she had NONE! if you don't like your job, you could quit, your a server, your pay check don't mean anything... it's the tips you should be working for, that's where's the moneys at...

3. refiling drinks, my water and glass of root beer was empty and she never came back to offer any drinks... how hard is that? do you seriously not know drinks, appetizers, deserts are the things that blows the bill up and get your more tips? or do you really enjoy working minimum wage?

4. follow ups, which she FAILED HARD! she came to our table 3 times. 
1. drop off menu's and take order, but we weren't ready to order yet and turned shit face... fine maybe she had a bad day?
2. ordering our food, she talks faster then a bullet train barely understand what she's trying to say. 
3. when she brought us our check, which we tried to flag her down and got ignored even she saw us. We ended up having to walk up to other staffs and ask for our checks, what is this? self service? 

But she does follow up on the tables sitting next to us on the left and right multiple of times but chooses to ignores our table, and it better not be cause she's racist against asians.

5. Another staff had to come up and apologize for her performance and this was his explanation ""cause it was busy earlier"". If you cannot perform and supply to the demand? maybe you should consider working some not so busy shifts or a not so busy job. Being a server that could perform is not easy which she totally failed.

Thanks to her i would not come back to this place again, getting humiliated once is more then enough. I also hope their management would reconsider on what shifts to assign to employees and make sure they could handle it.

Last time I was just passing through Vegas coming back from Zion in Utah and the wait was too long, guess the Ellis island ppl opened up a BBQ joint just around the corner (but still in the same casino) so ended up eating there. The BBQ does not disappoint!

Food

Metro Pizza (local chain) has a counter here. They have whole pizza and pizza by the slice, and Thursdays and Sundays feature BOGO free deals.

Their restaurant is open 24\/7. The vegetable omelet really hit the spot late night (or was it early morning?) The fish and chips were just OK. If you eat red meat, I hear good things about the $5.99 steak and egg breakfast and the $7.99 steak dinner.

Drink

$2.00 20 ounce microbrews. Yes, you read that correctly! They brew on the premises and the IPA is my favorite. They also have hard lemonade which I haven't tried yet.

They have a karaoke bar which is quite popular. I was there for a while and I never got to take the stage, but maybe my song got tossed (Sid Vicious' version of ""My Way"" might not have gone over very well).

Gambling

$5 blackjack and craps tables. Well, one craps table that you may have to get them to open. I was doing pretty well last time but they shut down at 1:00 am. That's why I'm docking them a star.

They also have full pay Jacks or Better video poker. If you haven't played, it's a mellow, low-stakes game that you can learn at your own pace. Why pay $2 for a beer when they'll serve you for free?

OK, so Ellis Island may lack the glamour of the Strip casinos. Do you want to actually have fun while you gamble? Do you need $5 tables and $1 video poker? The only way you can't have a good time here is if you lose all of your money. Don't do that. Bet with your head, not over it.

Good luck!",9,7,6

I was merely a tourist enjoying the strip of Nevada with my boyfriend for a couple of days so I had no idea where we can eat. Of course since we were at LV, my boyfriend and I wanted to eat at a restaurant that is local at this state. We ended up using yelp and searching through lists of nearby restaurants near us and came across Ellis Island. Boy... were we lucky to have found this place! I love it!

The food:
My boyfriend and I enjoyed what we ordered. It was delicious. We ordered the appetizer platter (we shared this since it was huge!) and then for our main meal, we both ordered the NY Steak and Shrimp combo. It's was delightful. Meat was tender and tasty and the mashed potato it came with were perfect to my liking.

The service:
We had this wonderful lady as our waiter. She was so lovely! I'm quite depressed because her name has slipped off of my mind. I wish I could give her a shout out here. But nonetheless, I'm sure all their waiters there are as welcoming as she is.

As one might expect from the name, they brew their own beer (and root beer, and egg nog during the holidays) and it is all excellent.  And at $1 a glass (or free if you're gambling, of course), you absolutely cannot go wrong.  You can also take home half gallon ""little brown jugs"" for later enjoyment.  Try the heffie; you won't regret it.

Only downside is that this place kind of has the ""old"" Vegas feel to it, so it's kind of dark and smoky.  But, every place in Vegas is smoky to a degree, so you get used to it I guess.",1,0,0

This was my first trip to Ellis Island, but it definitely won't be my last.  This little casino is definitely a little aged.  There is some wear and tear but it only seems to add to the character of this casino.  

My friends and I came here on a Sunday night because we had heard that they have karaoke at the little bar inside.  Now, if you know anything about me, you know that I love to karaoke.  I dunno why, it's just one of the very few Asian-y things about me.  Anyway, they set up karaoke at around 9:00 PM and what did I see as they were setting up?  Some older gentlemen dressed like Elvis passing out the song lists.  I don't even think they worked for the bar or the MC but they were definitely dressed for the part.  They also sang but I'll let you guess what artist they decided to karaoke.  

As for me  and my friends, I was the only one willing to suck it up and get up on stage to belt out a few tunes.  So after a few rounds of vodka tonics (very cheap vodka tonics btw) I finally put in my song request and headed up to the stage.  On my 3 song set list: Paul Anka's ""Put You Head On My Shoulder,"" Matchbox Twenty's ""Back 2 Good,"" and Sublime's ""Santeria.""  

As if stiff drinks and karaoke weren't enough for me to become completely enamored with Ellis Island, they also have an awesome pizza place in the casino.  What's also great is that you can grab a pizza and bring it inside the bar to enjoy.  

Ah Ellis Island, you'e definitely a diamond in the rough.",1,1,2

I heard about this place through Chowhound and I'm SO glad we took the chance to drive out of the way to try this place out. 

I was really really anxious walking into this out-of-the-way lackluster looking place, wondering if I screwed up and brought my group to a dive for a horrible meal. But they were kind and patient as they accommodated our 20 person group and every single one of us ordered the sirloin special. Our fears were gone once the food arrived. Salad\/Soup, steak, potatoes, and green beans. For $5! God damn, that's a good deal. 

Was the food exceptional? No, but the steak was moist, the potatoes soft, and the green beans were flavorful and like I said, such a good deal that the food just tastes better knowing how much money you saved.

A group of my friends and I walked here from our hotel to eat what was supposed to be cheap and decent food according to yelp. There was around 14 of us and we came at 5 pm on a Friday which is a pretty off time since it is a bit before dinner time.

We walked in there and standing behind the younger hostess in the front was an older blonde lady that seemed to be in her late 40s-50s. We came in, gave her the number in our party and she told us that there were too many of us and that the restaurant can't accommodate us. We looked around and just from the parts of the restaurant that we could see, we saw around 5 empty tables. We told her we didn't  mind splitting up into many tables. She also went far enough to say that no restaurant in Vegas will accommodate our group since there are so many of us. We said again that we can split into many parties, but her adamant answer was that we ""cannot be accommodated"". This whole time that younger hostess next to the moody older lady just looked at us awkwardly.

We were very polite and gave them absolutely no reason to refuse service to us but just the fact that our group was big (even though they have numerous empty tables).",4,1,0

We made it all the way over into the restaurant where the smell was less intense.  I ordered a chorizo burrito.  I wouldn't recommend ordering it, not because it wasn't great, but because it probably doesn't get ordered a lot and it took ages for our food to come out.

Well I decided that I wanted a Sandwich and waited in line at the Board-House. It was busy and when it was my turn I ordered the BBQ Chicken with no tomatoes and lettuce. She took my order and my coupon and did not ask me what my name was. I stood there the whole time watching what was the so called Manager make all the sandwiches. It was apparent that there was no more chicken to make the rest of the BBQ Chicken sandwich orders and he told his employee that he is going to be out of chicken. So I stood there to see if I was one of them that might not get my BBQ Chicken due to the sudden lack of chicken. I walked a way for a few minuets to ask my friends if they wanted my free beverage because I don't do beer and root beer. They said yes and I went back to ask the not so friendly cashier if I could have a half root beer half light beer and also asked her how much longer will i have to wait. She asked my name and when I told her Jon she said that they have been calling me for the past 10 mins. I told her how could that be because I have been standing her watching for the past 10 mins and no one called me to tell me that there would be no more chicken. I explained to all of them that the manager told the other person about the lack of chicken for the rest of the orders but no one called me to tell me. They also messed up on an order for the BBQ chicken sandwich. This gentlemen was supposed to get a whole and they made him a half. The bottom line is they messed up and did not want to admit to their mistake. If the cashier did call my name she is blind as a bat because I was standing right there to her right of her cash register the whole time and she never called me. Their solution was to call the casino security to have me removed. They tried to offer me a free item off their menu. They told my friends brother that they would be happy to make me anything off their menu. They could not come up to me to apologize or face me in person. Right before we left Ellis Island the cashier passed me to go to the restroom and gave me such a dirty look. I hope the owners read this and do something to correct the attitudes of their employees.

Here, the customer has no chance to be right. I happened to complain to the pit Boss. His name is Sal, about an incident I had with one of his cocktail waitresses. The problem I had was when Netty  (Nerry?) told other customers that I did not tip enough. She had told them in Spanish. Unfortunately, I speak a little spanish and on top of that, I spoke to the other customers and confirmed her actions. Netty (Nerry?) was so rude to me and i would not normally complain ....but because she completely embarrassed me and my friends I felt compelled to complain to someone. I was told by many other employees that this would not be taken into any consideration because Sal is having an affair Netty (Nerry?). I gamble a lot at this casino and spend a lot of money on table games and restaurants. So when I did complain to Sal, I felt comfortable he would take care of the situation, as he promised. Suddenly, several hours later, as I am still gambling, I am told by security that I am no longer welcome at ellis Island. Even the security officer that knows me was confused and shocked. I asked him to tell me why I am 86ed. He could not. Only stating they needed a cooling off period of 3-6 months. I am still confused why? So tonight.....4 months later, I was greeted by security with a welcome and continued to have  pizza at metro and never left the restaurant except to go to the bathroom. I was then greeted outside the bathroom by the same security that had  welcomed me and was told to leave......again. I still do not know why i have been singled out and abused. This casino is a joke. One cocktail waitress controls the whole place. Many employees are so afraid of losing their pathetic jobs and or repercussions from Sal because he is having a relationship with Netty (Nerry?).

I know this is Vegas but these are the places where you can feel the gambling addiction running through the place like a current, the crowd was tense, manic and the smell of desperation wafted through stronger than the pumped in air over the smoke.

I feel bad to write this to be honest, the staff I spoke to before we went were really nice but once we slipped inside, this place was WHACK!

You know those movies where people are just 'in the background' trying to not look at the camera? Well those people come and sing karaoke and gamble here.

We slid in on a weeknight around 11pm to see about karaoke and found that the book was pretty sparse.  The singers were taking it all WAY too seriously for a place like this and the host said it'd be an hour or more to get on the rotation.

Um, not for us, sorry.",12,10,10

Yes, the tiny casino with low ceilings has a ""smoking problem"". It is the reason I give my fave dive only 4 stars. I'm just sensitive to cigarette smoke.

Do I still go almost every single time I'm there? Heck yes! 

Like all of the positive reviewers state, go early or late, but if you go on a Friday or Saturday night at dinner time, plan to wait...a long while!

I used to love this place when I was in college and I still like it for the value it provides.  Sometimes you just need a decent meal and drink at reasonable prices.  The restaurant serves up a filling steak special, as well as a generous ham steak.  Add a soft drink or coffee and you still come out under $10.  Sure, the Wynn it ain't, but that is nonetheless a hard bargain to beat when your tummy needs food.

Even the drinks are cheap (as nearly every Yelp review mentions).  $4.50 for top shelf cocktails!  Unfortunately, as the years have passed, the drinks get more and more watered down, and I have reached my breaking point.  My buddies and I had a few rounds and EVERY single drink tasted like flavored water.  I sweat I couldn't taste the alcohol in anything we were served.

The service was slow and many people were not seated, even thoug I saw plenty of open tables. The hostess's waiting system seemed a bit flawed, and we were seated in 30 minutes. Also, I had to track down the waiter to refill my water, and she barely checked up on us.

* The salad was your basic crap-bagged salad from the local grocery store, with one tomato. Yuck.

* We didn't even finish our meal. Our waitress never checked on us, and we were ready to go. We waited and looked around as she never showed up again. I was almost about to take my food up to the register and ask them for my check. She finally shows up, we ask for our check and we leave.

I'd like to give zero stars on the service because let me tell you, I have never experience the type of service they were giving that day. Dora, the hostess had an attitude on her. Every so often I would check about how much longer until our number will be called and she said ""I am sorry I cannot give you that estimiate because it depends on how fast people eat."" Really?
Then our number was skipped because she said they had to get the table ready but there was two other tables ready, I didn't understand it. I saw a customer trying to ask her a question and she turned her back at him and was like you need to go talk to your waiter and the customer was so upset, he just walked away. I think Dora should brush up on her customer service skills and be a little more happier next time. 

I gave 2 stars and put up with the wait because I heard the food was worth it. In the end I was very satified with the food but it just didn't seem like a happy environment. The place seemed stressed out.",3,0,0

The food is average, nothing special.

The majority of our group ordered the steak special. While we weren't expecting a legendary tasting steak, we also weren't expecting what it turned out to be. A medium rare steak was as tough as nails with little to no flavor -  I had to douse my chunk with A1 sauce to make it bearable. The side salad was loaded with dressing, most likely to hide its age and brown spots. What's the point of eating a salad when all its supposed benefits are negated by an exorbitant amount of dressing? The beer it came with tasted stale and watered down. I literally have nothing positive to say about this place. Even the price that you all rave about doesn't make it worth coming to. I hate McDonalds but would have preferred it over this junk.

Blaine is no stranger to rough neighborhoods as a former person that would be in the know for a major player on the strip (didn't ask, just gettin some grub after my 5 am Spin and 1600 swim). Wow I must remember this is not about me).  Blaine warned me this is not a place you want to be after the witching hour as it's a nightly ""Pimps and Ho's event with the Varsity players and from the size of the massive and abundant security staff there, I'd say there may be some validity to B's warning.)

So I walk in, it's Friday, good foot traffic; not the Beemer crowd but nice, down to earth folks. ie, as I was cruisin the lot for a parking spot a guy flagged me down to let me know he's leaving. Nice, right? Anyway, it's a brewery and casino but the smoke wasn't bad; noticeable but not sinus hair burning. 

I don't normally drink, but wanted to sample one of their homemade brews.  I ordered a ""Light"" and it was very good.  I light the refreshing qualities of a Pilsner.  Went really well with the food I'm about to drop the 411 on yah.

The ""restaurant"" has limited fare. Don't expect to find lettuce or tofu here. This is pure Saturday afternoon, college tailgating, pig and yard bird BBQ. Carnivore City baby.

You walk in the front, turn right, pass the bar and you're there. Easy to find. On the Host's stand the menu offers a full rack of ribs, a half rack, a half chicken, or the combo. Comes with corn on the cob, baked beans and bread that I saw them grill... Pavlovian moment here; excuse me.  Awww SNAP!!! It's F Bombing here!!! Gotta get my grub on! BRB! Dang!

...Okay, I have nothing else to add here. It's as if I got choked out by a Gracie and when I woke up, it was over! Just a plate covered with pork and fowl bones, some fractured styrofoam containers and my stuffed belly causin' chaos with my gig line.  (a gig line is the line created by your pants zipper, belt buckle and shirt buttons).

 In the afterglow... Please bear with me. I need to cuddle and spoon now. Wow that was good! He'll, it's was fantastic. Filling, hot, flavorful, and NO processed food at all. Good stuff Maynard!   Don't geddit twisted, it's not the Meaa Grille but it got down Charlie Brown! 

I started with the chicken. The meat was smokey, moist, tender, succulent, full of flavor, not just from the Q but the actual bird was tasty... Scratch ""moist"", let's use ""juicey"" here. Left the breast to simmer as I hear the half rack of babybacks a callin... Here Mikey, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey!!! The rib meat came off the bone easily, but not over done. They had the perfect texture and M E A T Y!!! Wooo hooo, they were thick! The sauce was tangy with a molasses\/vinegar twang. Kept dippin' into the side sauce provided.  Good grub!

The beans weren't of the sweet variety but more savory. I like em.

The Cole slaw was cold, crispy, and tangy without the overwhleming slipperiness brought on by excessive mayo... I liked it! 

You get a whole cob of corn! It's a bit over done for my taste, but it's not my house. It was good though. Did not have butter which amazes me.  

Grilled sourdough. Do I really need to say anything? I do wish they'd slather some garlic and olive oil on it though. 

If you want to pig out on the cheap with some great food, you gotta get down at the Island, but before the witching hour, okay?

I came here during dinnertime specifically for the BBQ.  I was told there was a wait time for indoor seating, but I could sit at the outside tables for immediate service.  The decision seemed rather obvious.  It was moderately hot out, but not so bad in the shade.  I placed my order and within 5 minutes was served.  I got the full rack of ribs (after reading all the reviews that recommended it), and I'm glad I did.  It was delicioso, and tasted even better with the BBQ sauce.  All for only $15.

This place's only fatal flaw?

The lack of sides.  No baked potato, no french fries, no mashed potatoes.  I've never had BBQ without some sort of spud before.  The plate is served with cole slaw, chili, corn on the cob and bread and butter, though.  But with no option for french fries, I left feeling oddly...unfinished.

Though I came a little past noon so steak & eggs were $9.99 and it came with fried potatoes and 4 toasts with your choice of bread. I heard the earlier in the day you come, they have a special which knocks off a few dollars.

Its a bargain. I also ordered garlic string green beans as a side order for $2.99.
I was thinking of ordering steak fries, but forget it. The fried potatoes that come with the steak & eggs was tasty and not oily. I love it.

They have a remote control thing just like yard house and earls sandwiches. You hold it until your number has been called to be seated. 
The wait took 20 minutes. Short staff and the food took forEVER to come out. Its okay. It was worth the wait after being seated and ordering, you wait more. Just like the doctors office. 

I would come back. They had black jack tables and craps. It was dangerous playing before we eat. Uhh be prepared. 
It seems like a lot of locals come here. I like this hidden gem spot. Its located off the strip.",2,1,1

This past weekend my S.O. and I were there.  We waited close to an hour for a table.  If you're impatient like me play the penny machines while you wait.  We were finally seated and she orders the $9.99 steak & eggs and I order the $7.99 chicken fried steak and eggs.  They don't serve the cheap special steak & eggs after 1 PM.  But it's still a good deal and it's so worth it if you're hung over and need something greasy in your stomach.  Be sure to blow on your food.

The casino is a total dive. Dim lighting inside with an overwhelming rush of smoke. We got there early so we decided to have dinner in the bar while we waited for the show.

When I moved to Las Vegas in 2007, I did really know anyone, I was living with a friend of my dad's and his young daughters far out in North Las Vegas, and wondering if moving for a new job on a literally one week's notice had been a good idea.  My first weekend there, on Sunday, I decided to go do karaoke by myself, and ended up at Ellis Island.

It was amazing.  A true mix of tourists and locals (which isn't too common one block from the strip), ranging wildly in age, race, class, and singing ability.  Giving the karaoke everything they got.  And getting up and dancing when strangers sang songs they loved.  Drinking $1 ""microbrews"", and $3 wells.  Sitting in leather booths.  The k-jay breaking out his saxophone for solos.  So.  Freaking.  Awesome.

I went back on a sober day and it was a big mistake. I wish I would have kept that idea in my mind. The 5 star idea. I was crushed, crushed to try the food and not understand why it didn't taste like I remembered, like I remembered the last time I ate there. Why don't you taste the same? 

I understand now that it was 4am. I was drunk eating. 

If there was such a thing as food patrol, I would have received a well deserved ticket on food alteration based on the level of alcohol in my body.   This was the cause for me giving them 5 stars before.

You aren't going to be the only person doing so! So you may have a little bit of a wait... But deals like those found at Ellis Island are worth a little patience. 

$1.75 for a beer brewed on-site... The only thing that may beat that bargain is the $7.99 steak dinner special that includes a beer. Yes, prices were cheaper a year or two back... They are still really low for a city will of places that charges $6 for a bottle of water and $18 for a Red Bull with vodka. Anywhere you can get 22 ounces of craft beer for $2 or less is a deal! For those of you looking to stay sober, they also brew a very tasty root beer.

I went with my husband and his brother to Ellis Island for some cheap beer, dinner and gambling. It was a Tuesday night, we had about a 30 minute wait for a table in the restaurant so we sat down to play some video poker. My brother-in-law paid $2 to enter a slot tournament (they have them daily), ended up winning it and walked out with $114 and a story to tell his friends back home! 

The three of us had dinner and beers for $30, not a bad deal at all. The steak dinner special is what I had, they steak isn't anything you'd get at a fancy steakhouse but it's still good for the price, which also includes a potato and veggie side.

They're kinda slow and it's usually busy so that doesn't help.  It sometimes takes a while for them to decide who your server is and\/or for them to come take your order.  
That said, I still come to Ellis to eat because the food's good and it can be very cheap.  You kinda have to know about the specials tho.  (don't think they're on the menu)  Basically, I get 1 of 2 things when I go.  Either the ""Dinner Special"" (soup or salad, nice sized thick cut steak, potato and green beans, and a beer which they brew there; all for $6.99)  It says on the place mats that they are one of the top 10 breweries in America.  I'm not a beer expert, but it is good and they have a variety of kinds to choose from.  They're cheap too at somewhere around $2.  They even make their own Root Beer, (which you can get with the dinner special instead of a beer) but beware that it's very, very sweet.  
The other thing I order is the steak and eggs for $4.99 (thin but decent steak, eggs made-to-order, hash-browns, and toast.)  Both are a great value.  The dinner more so therefore I usually get that.  I have eaten the steamed clams a couple times as well and they are delicious!  They also have a BBQ restaurant at which, I've been told, are the best ribs in Vegas.  Sadly I haven't eaten there yet but I look forward to checking it out.  :)

Don't get me wrong, it's not the best slab of ribs I've ever had. In fact, it tastes like they actually BOIL the ribs, but once you slather on their tangy bbq sauce, your taste buds will beg for more as you tear into the tender ribs.  Too bad they don't throw the ribs on a grill and glaze some of the sauce on top of the ribs.  That would really take it up a notch.  This place would have received 4 stars if their beer was better, but can I really complain about a 2 dollar beer?  At least they made an attempt to brew it themselves.  Kudos to that.

Wait: We arrived for dinner at around 7 PM on a Sunday. The wait was about a half hour for 2 people, but there are seats for you to sit while you wait.

Food: The portions were hearty. I had the Chicken Fried Steak (delicious but heavy on the salt and pepper) with mashed potatoes, salad, and mixed vegetables for $8.99. The husband had a 10 oz steak with beer, salad, mashed potatoes, and green beans. He said the beer was good. (This place also is a microbrewery.) I also had a slice of apple pie (for $3.99). There was a slight fishy smell (as if it was placed next to a bowl of steamed shrimp) and portions of the slice were either really warm or really cold, but that didn't bother me because I really did enjoy my dinner overall. :)

Atmosphere: The area around the establishment isn't as clean\/safe as the Strip, so just be aware of your surroundings. It's not dangerous though. 

Service: Our server was Carol. She was quick, accommodating, friendly, and helpful.

Bottom line: I'd give this place a 4.5 but I'm rounding up to 5. (The -0.5 was for the atmosphere and the multi-temperature and fishy smelling apple pie.) The best thing about this place are the prices and portions. (Great value for your money!) It is a nice relief from the overpriced fare on the Strip.

One of the best developments in the past decade of Vegasdom has been the arrival of America's top chefs, but I love to balance my Vegas trips between the pricier offerings and dirt cheap, classic meals of yore. While pretty much unavailable at the large strip casinos, if you're willing to wade into local territory, you'll find that few deals are as good as the steak special at Ellis Island.  

It's a nice (not Morton's nice, you greedy assholes, diner nice) slab of steak, a couple ounces more than what you'd see at Sizzler, along with crunchy, garlic green beans, steak cut fries (or baked or mashed potato), and a choice of beer or root beer. I tasted the root beer, which is far superior to the corn syrup version you might be used to, and I had the dark stout, which wasn't as dark as I like it, but fuck. Eight fucking dollars for the whole thing? I'll take it.

Then upon further thought, Barkeep 2 tells barkeep 1, there are to-go cups in certain area, if they wish to pour their own.
Whatever. So, they pour large glasses, which I re-pour into to-go cups and now must drink part of both glasses so pour fits in ""too small"", to-go cups. This is disastrous.

Came here at 1am on Memorial Day weekend after a night of unsuccessful clubbing. Figured if I'm not in the club, I can go karaoke and laugh at people...you know, make a night out of it ;)

The karaoke bar was pretty packed and we were surprised to find a table open. We ordered some Courvoisier since they didn't serve Henny and just enjoyed the show. 


Everyone was semi-drunk, which is always fun. And everyone was singing along to pretty good singers. SO GOOD that I think they have ringers there; like some guy that was dressed like Elvis sang a pretty-darn-good version of Blue Hawaii.
The folks sang: Nothing but a G thang, Bohemian Rhapsody, and even Adele. 

It was a great mix of bad and great singing that I think I had more fun here than I would've at the club.... at least, this is what I tell myself!

After the karaoke closed up, we ate at the 24 hour café they have and it was really good stuff. Menu was very diverse that my friend had breakfast, another had chicken and gravy, and I had the prime rib. All of which was less than $12.

The Travel Network did a Vegas special on cheap eats, and Ellis Island restaurant was the one place I remember. Having been to Vegas just 2 months ago, I didn't mind doing some off-strip exploring.

We arrived at Ellis Island where we saw the glorious sign: $6.99 Top Sirloin Steak Dinner. After a 30 minute wait for our table, we sat down in excitement for our cheapo dinner.

And guess what? Not only did the dinner come with a 10oz sirloin, it also came with a pint of microbrew, soup or salad, green beans and a choice of mashed potato, baked potato or fries. OMG, jackpot!!!

Besides my steak being slightly overcooked than what I ordered, the meal was great! I was in too much bliss. Also, our server was super nice and friendly. And I especially liked him, since he only carded me out of the whole table. Haha. =P

""Don't forget to Yelp about the Indiana Jones slot machine."" Here you go, sis! It was awesome. Everytime she hit a bonus, we screamed. So much that the security guy came over.

Ellis Island has its own microbrewery. On their list they have: Amber ale, Hefe Weiss ale, Dark lager, Light lager and Root beer. The Amber has a strong wheat\/yeast finish, somewhat similar to Sierra Nevada perhaps. The Dark reminds me of Guiness. Dark and bitter finish.

My problem is that no one seems to know or care how beef should be served cooked to order. I have ordered Prime Rib or the Sirloin here around 9 times in the past two months. I normally would order Med-Rare. But after 4\/5 orders delivered over cooked (twice I received fully Well Done end cuts), I decided to try ordering Rare. It worked one time, the other two times it was closer to Medium to Medium-Well. Tonight I ordered the Prime Rib Rare, you can see in the picture what I received. This piece of meat is on the border of Well-Done. It's a pure crap shoot here. Ive seen lucky people at tables next to me get their food as ordered. I've seen a bunch of people send the order back. You would think that the cook, server, or hostess would know the difference between Rare and Well-Done. But they either don't or just don't care.

Another interesting experience....Ordered the Prime Rib to go, told the hostess to make sure that I received Au Jus and Creamy Horseradish in the to go bag upon ordering. (my previous 3 to go's did not include this, even though it comes standard when you order at table). Go to pick up my order and no Au Jus or Horseradish in the bag. Nicely asked the hostess to get me some. After a few minutes she comes out with 2 Au Jus and no Horseradish. Nicely explain to her again that I wanted Horseradish too, she seemed not to understand, I said it several times. She comes back with 4 packs of Relish. Yes, Green Pickle Relish.

The $5 steak dinner is now $6.99 but comes with a free beer (or root beer - AMAZING). At night, you WILL have to wait 1-2 hours for a seat, but you can take a number and then do some gambling, or go in the bar and sing karaoke (at the #1 karaoke spot in Las Vegas??) and\/or get your drank on.

There's also the AMAZING barbecue ribs restaurant adjacent to the karaoke bar\/regular restaurant, and for under $10, you can get a HUGE half-rack of the most tender, juicy, flavorful, smoky, wonderful, meat-filled heavenly blessed BBQ rib EVAR.

$1 single deck , $5 multiple deck black jack,  on the weekend daytimes (increases at around 4-5 pm) but WAY cheaper than the big ones on the Strip. They only have 2-3 blackjack tables though.

$1 roulette in the evenings, etc. Only 1 roulette table though.

More Useful Things:

If you become a club member, make sure to ask them for a freebie! They have nice stuff - t-shirt, shot glasses, mugs, etc.

Save your place mat from the restaurant - it'll give you an extra $5 down for 1 blackjack play! (But for some reason, EVERYONE who uses this always loses the particular round... Very peculiar indeed)

If you sign up to sing for Karaoke, pass the time by playing some of the slot machines near the bar - or you might just miss your name being called!!!!!!

We sat at the bar and waited as the new grey haired bartender guy waited on everyone that was at the bar, even new people that came in. But, he totally ignored me and my guy. He could see that we had our Ellis Island club cards out and had printed out our club coupons. We sat there & sat there as this bartender walked past us several times, making sure to never make eye contact. After about 10 minutes, we spoke up to try to get his attention. He refused to acknowledge us! We gave up & went to the other bar where we were greeted & served immediately. That bartender remembers us & knows we moved here from Hawaii. As always, he received a generous tip when we left. But, we will never return. We do not need to be desrespected by being refused service. Ellis Island has turned into a dump. Be warned. Stay away!

I overheard the host saying that it's because of a server switchover. Servers didn't seem very happy but luckily for us our server was very friendly.

We were seated in a booth in the back. We signed up for the players club and got to spin the wheel for free points (I got 2,500 =$2.50) l, prizes (sis got free beer) & a coupon for $9.99 steak. DO NOT PRINT IT OUT! they have good specials on 8oz New York steak, eggs, fried potatoes and toast for only $6.99. 

We ordered two of the steak specials and a prime rib ($14.99). My prime rib came with green beans and choice of a side, I got mashed potatoes and soup or salad. I gave my cream of broccoli soup to my sister and she said it was pretty good. I ordered a prime rib done medium and it came out medium well, it was still very soft and tasty though! Lots of fat, but a huge portion. I had half left over to take home. 

I'll have to agree with other reviews that the food & service here is very inconsistent. 

Come here on a weekend from 9am-2 pm to get a Bloody Mary right in front of the cafe. It's build your own for ($7). They put whatever you want in it, and they use titos vodka. Ours had a bacon strip, a pickle, olives, limes, a piece of chicken & waffles. It was VERY good.",3,1,2

The casino is very small.  We came here for the $5 steak and eggs special, but they estimated a 20-25 minute wait.  So to the tables I went.  Standard blakjack, dealer didn't speak much English though.  After losing my buddy's $20 on the first hand (BS... two jacks and dealer shows blackjack :( ) I made $15 for myself (after going down about $30ish).  So after 15 minutes of cards and going through the deck, I went to wait with my group.  After 25 minutes we asked how much longer and they said they had a table of 11 to seat before us.  10 minutes later, they let us in.  Eh.

After being seated, we had a horrible server to start us off.  He walked up to the table and stared at us.  My brother was confused so he asked if the guy was there to take our order.  He answered yes.  So we placed our order and thought that was over.  He then took out jam away, we figured he was refilling it.  Nope.  After waiting another 20ish minutes we got our food.

The food was actually good.  I think it's my favorite $5 steak and eggs place in Vegas so far.  The sirloin was actually OK and the eggs were done right.  The potatoes it came with was the big difference.  It was cubed up and fried like fries.  But it was seasoned really well.

I'd come back here again, maybe.  The service was kinda ridiculous though.  I'd give this a 4 or maybe even a 5 if I had a better experience.",0,0,0

Well...none of the beers blew me away, but I still support breweries every time. Their Stout and Hef is worth trying though. They also make a Lager, Golden, and Amber Ale. Nothing too aggressive, which I miss from Northern California Beers. 

Casino: Old school feel with a mix of new and old slot machines, $5 table games with really nice dealers. Lots of TV's for watching the game. Place where the locals and taxi drivers hangout.

I did enjoy the $10 free game play when you signed up for their rewards card.  I won some money and had fun doing it.  

The place itself is very small and really snug to get around everyone when there is a lot of people there.  It was on a Saturday, so that was to be expected.  It wouldn't hurt to expand the area though.  Remodel, anyone?

The Beach Party was nice.  The sun was definitely beating down on everyone, and I kept going inside to cool down.  They offered us Yelpers some good deals on their beer, food, and prizes during the party.  

My husband and I didn't stay long, and we really didn't like their beer.  Sorry!!  We didn't enjoy the taste, but we did really like their root beer!  :)  Plus, the cigarette smoke was way to heavy inside.  This place needs better ventilation.

The people that work there could be more cheerful, maybe it was just an off day for everyone.  Most of the people working the beach party were nice, but the inside people were not so nice.  Kinda 50\/50.  I would be grumpy working in a tight space with lots of people too.

It's great if you aren't picky about your surroundings.  It's mostly a locals place, but visitors like us were readily welcomed by the staff and patrons.  Everyone was friendly, and we went about four or five times.  

First night was Karaoke.  It was Saturday night and it was clear there's a very loyal clientele that lives for it.  People were dancing to the songs, even when the singer was terrible.  One guy was so bad that someone who sang pretty well earlier finally got up and sang the rest of the song as a duet with him!  

Full-pay video poker at the quarter level, so we played for a few hours and only lost a little.  Had breakfast there the next morning and it was as good and cheap as others have said.  Sunday night we went back for the steak dinner.  The wait was about an hour, so we gambled and had a few beers (free while gambling).  The dinner was excellent for the price - steak was tender and cooked to order.  We gambled there a couple of more times and overall didn't lose much.  We aren't smokers and didn't find it to be as smokey as some have said. 

It's only about a five-minute walk from the sports book exit of Bally's and not a bad area at all.  Some have said it's sketchy, but I'd say that's only if you're comparing it to suburbia.  By urban standards it's a just fine.  It's just south of Flamingo on Koval past a gas station and 7-11.  Sure, it's not fancy, but it's definitely real!  If you like it you may also like Terrible's further east on Flamingo (maybe a mile from Bally's).  It's our previous (now second) favorite ""dive.",0,0,0

I will touch on the Cafe, the BBQ and the Casino.  We have been coming to Vegas for over 20 years and spend plenty of time at the black jack tables.

Restaurant's get four stars but casino only one star on this trip.

The cafe was great (as always) we both had the steak special. The salad was good and the steak was cooked properly.  The in-house root beer was delicious and dad enjoyed the micro-brew.

BBQ was equally delicious.  We both got a full rack of ribs, our hotel room had a fridge for left overs.  They could do without the corn on the cob.  Why serve corn on the cob when you let it sit in a pan of water and it turns out soggy rather than crunchy?  They could roast the corn on the grill and have it turn out awesome.

We have played black jack in the casino many times.  They have good rules. decent limits and friendly dealers.  They have older pit boss who has been there forever, an older gentleman.  He always seemed less than pleasant and a bit offish.  We had an incident where the dealer misdealt and had to call the boss over.  He told her to burn the Ace.  the Ace would have helped my dad's hand and he would have taken the card whether he knew it was an Ace or not.  The boss said to burn it.  

Now, whenever we have encountered something similar to this at other casinos (mistakes do happen) the boss would give the player the choice of taking or burning the card.  After all, it was the dealer's mistake, not ours.  When I spoke up (cause dad is 87) the boss rudely and gruffly said it's his casino and his rules.  End of discussion.

At that point we took our money off the table and left.  We will probably go back another day but we only play where we enjoy and have fun.  I had a rude pit boss at Foxwood's twenty years ago and have never been back.  Ellis Island is worth the trip but I won't play there if Mr. Happy is working.",1,0,0

Because its satisfying for any meal of the day! Whether it be breakfast, lunch, dinner, or late night meal after clubbing... its always good.  However, it does depend on where you go.  We usually go to Ellis Island because the steak & eggs is cheap and usually good.  I prefer the steak & eggs from Tuscany but they only serve it at a cheap price super late at night-early morning...but anyways here is my review for the food.

I ordered steak and eggs.  I asked for my meat medium rare, sunny-side up and wheat slices of bread.  Nothing to complain about it.  My steak was cooked to how I wanted it to be and there was barely any fatty pieces to it which is a definite plus.  I hate when I ordered steak somewhere and a good portion of my meat is actually just fat... so stars for that! Plus, even though the size of the meat was small, it was actually really thick so it filled me up quick!  However I do I wish they gave more potatoes with my meal because I LOVE POTATOES.  I always eat some of my boyfriends too because I finish mine so fast. lol  

I usually can never finish everything so my boyfriend finishes whats leftover for me :)  (That's what boyfriends are for! hehe jk :)) 

Service is usually okay.. This past weekend however, we came during dinner time on a Sat night and the food took pretty long for it come out which was a bummer because I was starving! But its okay, understandable since we did have to wait for a table and all, meaning they were busier than when we usually come.

There was about a 40 minute wait, but while we were waiting, they gave us each 10 bucks freeplay for being new, which we were able to convert into 10 bucks cash at the one, rather well-hidden video blackjack machine, so that was nice. Had something to do, *and* basically made our breakfast more than free, since they already discounted their steak special from 8 dollars to 6, and then let us use our dollar off coupon (from the machine next to the restaurant: put in your player's card, get free coupon) on that. Not the best steak I'd ever had (though really, it wasn't half-bad, other than it was kind of raw in the center, so I had to throw a couple bites out), and certainly not the best service, but definitely the best 5 dollar steak I've ever had, and the best service I've ever had at a place that sold steak for 5 dollars. 

I would say, don't come here if you're in a hurry, but do come here if you aren't.

This is a perfect example... What could be more fun while in lost wages than that?

Well then you need to bet $10 per hand... fun little incentive there isn't it?

Pro Tip: Hell you can nap at a restaurant table if you need to after clubben n grubben!

They have a karaoke bar, a pizza parlor, a diner (the aforementioned sleeping zone =Z). I mean what more could you want... wait you want lower prices?

For 12.99, you get a delicious slab of prime rib, with au jus, soup of the day or salad, green beans (which I think are very tasty), and your choice of a side.

My coworker suggested this place the first time I went to Vegas a few months ago (yeah I'm a loser I waited way past I was 21 for my return to Vegas).  I was really skeptical since she said the prime rib here was under $10 with the Players Card and tasted exactly like the expensive stuff.  Still, I managed to pull my hungover self as a place to eat on the way back home on a Sunday and OMG I fell in love.  I ended up staying here a few hours longer than I expected and make it a point to come back here every time I'm in Vegas!  The first two times I came there was about a 20 minute wait, but the last time I came for lunch there was no wait at all.  I heard there is usually a wait so just make a Players Card and use the $10 credit they give you while you wait.

They don't have the prime rib as a special anymore but they have a top sirloin with a beer (regular brew or rootbeer) for $8.99 so I always order that instead.  The value for the type of food is spectacular!!!  The 8 oz steak I usually get medium-rare and usually is cooked to perfection except for one time (it was overcooked just a little but it was easily sent back).  It comes with a side of potatoes, green beans, and a salad.  The steak has a nice crust  and it so deliciously juicy.  All the sides taste like how they are supposed to and you'd be surprised by how not overcooked\/soggy the canned beans taste cause they still have a slight crisp to them, and baked potatoes are pretty hard to mess up.  This last time I ordered a french onion soup and I thought it had a pretty decent flavor for being $4.99.  I have also tried their rootbeer and it tastes pretty good but you can definitely taste the spices at the end.

I always end up sitting around the bar for a while before\/after eating and just relaxing getting out of the hustle and bustle of Vegas.  I like winding down here and having a light beer (really refreshing!).  Bf always forgets and orders the Hef which he doesn't like and the 2nd beer always turns out to be a light heh.  Service is always quick and hospitable.   

There are tons of advertisements for cheap food with the actual food not looking like the advertisements, but hands down I think Ellis Island has the best taste and value for the price!  If you're coming to Vegas without intentions to spend a lot of money on food, definitely stop by here.",5,3,3

They have great breakfast with a steak & eggs combination on the cheap. Also, they have a special for a beer, steak, and fries (or baked potato) that is very tasty for $8. You got that right $8. I know some places in DC where I can even buy a beer for $8. This is where the gambling gods have blessed you with cheap and tasty food all the time. They also have great Microbrews and pizza - this is a mans place.

Let me start by saying that I have done more than 400 reviews at this point and have only given out 20 1-star reviews. That is less than 5%. I am a pretty easy going and easy to please guy. Working with the public for more than 25 years and in casinos here in Las Vegas for more than 15 years, I like to believe I am very understanding as well. 

But after what I got here at Ellis Island today, I refuse to spend another red cent here ever again. What is more frustrating is that I have been a semi-regular patron of EI for over 10 years now. I have always sung its praises as a great hole-in-the-wall place to friends and when family would visit I would have them enjoy that tasty BBQ.

No more.

I came here today for the low key atmosphere. Played some slots(no luck there) and placed some sports bets(we'll see ;)....I than saw a few days ago that they had released some brand new $1 chips. I went to the cashier to buy 3 of them and was met with such a rude and snappy reply it really took me a second to process it. I'm sorry, are they made of gold?? What's with the attitude??

Now I understand many casinos do not want to ""sell"" casino chips, because they are made for table play. I get that. I understand that. Ever since I moved here in the late 90's I like to buy 2 or 3 chips from each casino as part of my personal collection. I am NOT a chip dealer. I do not sell them. It is simply something for my modest little collection. I could understand if I wanted to buy 20, 30, or 50...or whatever....but 3??? Really?? All that attitude and the short, curt responses were hardly necessary. 

In 15 years of doing this I have NEVER had a cage cashier treat me like the way she did today. This was an older lady working the cage around 11:30 this morning. Completely unnecessary and totally uncalled for.

I'm most annoyed I didn't hit the cage first because I  spent money in the machines and made some sports bets first. Had I experienced this first, I would have left immediately.

I can tell you one thing though. My 11 year love affair with Ellis Island is over. I will not be back and I will no longer bring friends and family here for the brews, bbq, slots, etc. I drive past too many other casinos to get there that will not treat me like asking for 3-$1 chips is a criminal offense.

1 star.

CAFE.
Slowest service ever! I've been here twice now after night clubbing and each time it took them forever to come out with our drinks at the beginning and to come back at the end to pick up our check. We were literally dying of exhaustion.

Food wise though, the $6.99 deal for NY Steak and Egg is the best deal you can possibly get in Las Vegas! This casino is literally behind the strip (half a mile behind Linq & Flamingo) so it's not a very far off drive to get food after some late night fun. Your deal comes with steak, your choice of eggs, your choice of bread, and a side of potatoes. I've never been able to finish everything. My medium-rare steak was done perfectly this time, and the wheat toast was perfect with not too much butter. They do sometimes overcook your meat! Two of my friends' medium-rare turned out well-done but at least their eggs were really good...?

Again, service is not perfect and can be sloppy. Our orders were jumbled around and my wheat toast landed on my friend's plate instead. Easily fixed but definitely a mark off their service.

Also, they have karaoke here ... And some people just straight up SCREAM into the microphone. Yeah, sure, it can be fun for people in the karaoke room but maybe they shouldn't have set that up directly next to the cafe where food patrons are enjoying their meal?

CASINO.
Lots of machines to play on. Table games, such as Blackjack, have ridiculously low buy-ins. The dealer my friends played against for Blackjack sucked though. Long-story-short, she f*cked up the rules and knew it but was in too deep in her argument to change it. So they lost and angry-gambled back on the strip to make up for it lols.

Overall, I would only want to come here for the food.. It's ridiculously cheap!!! Even without the steak and egg deal! But otherwise, SKIP. Food cooking is not consistent, service may be nice but they're soooo slow ugh, and casino is not that great.

FYI: it's not on the strip so taxis don't really pick up here. You can however ask them to drop you off and then request an uber\/lyft! If not, just drive yourself here :)",5,4,3

Wanted to try something different than my usual King Cut Prime Rib ($12.99 with either a beer or root beer) so I ordered the Fried Chicken special.
It is presented in a big basket with steak fries, cole slaw, and FOUR good sized pices of fried chicken.

$6.99 for all this? Can't go wrong....You don't have to wait a minimum of 20 minutes, and you pay DOUBLE for THREE pieces of chicken at other soul food joints in town.

Crisp exterior and juicy inside, including the breast which can be dry at times...another good tip is to ask the waitperson for some honey to drizzle onto each bite.....YUM! ...and they serve the real stuff, not the fructose corn syrup fast food stuff....skip the sirloin and give the chicken a shot...Oh, if you,re in the mood for BBQ, go elsewhere...they pre cook their chicken and boil their ribs and then, they heat it on the grill for smokiness, then they brush on the sauce.

You can't miss their $6.99 steak dinner that is available 24 hours. Their steak dinner is posted on the sign outside. So what do you get for $6.99? You get a steak (they'll ask you how you want it cooked), green beans and one side dish. You also get either soup or salad. You can add another $1.50 to get a beer with your meal. Our whole group ordered beer. They have other food too and I've tried their country fried steak. The gravy that they use is awesome and it feels like they take the time to craft the perfect meal. I'm pretty sure it's not healthy for you but the food is good! 

The service in the restaurant is good. We didn't have to deal with any unhappy servers. In fact our server was super nice. The order was huge because of how many people were in our group. We took up 3 tables. 

The atmosphere feels like this place is open 24 hours. It's dark and you are constantly hearing the sounds of the those slot machines that suck your money out of your pocket. You do smell the smoke of the cigarettes and cigars that seep their way into the restaurant. The seats are also old and dated.

The casino itself is alright if you're looking to gamble. Their prices are cheaper than other machines in the area.  Blackjack is cheaper than the main casinos so that's a plus.

You can opt for mash potato's, baked potato, fries, and it comes with green beans. I always get the mash and the reason why is because it's a cheesy mash potato with gravy and it's smooth and buttery. The prime rib in itself I always get medium rare and you get a slab. I wouldn't compare it to Lawry's type of prime rib where the whole meat is juicy. This while tasteful you can tell the quality isn't the same. It's still good eats however being hungover.

I work down the street in one of the large hotels on Harmon.  This is a 5min drive...10min if you catch every light on a Sunday night.

I placed the order, and was told 45min-1hr ETA,  After an hour and fifteen, I call back and get the same hostess\/order taker.  I ask if she has any idea if my food was on the way.  She tells me there was a mix up with the order, that they were busy, and that my food was being cooked as we spoke.

Really??  So it isn't even on it's way yet??  So I get told that it will be another 30min for my order.  So obviously I am mad, and she says she will take off some of the food  (about $6 worth) and add some extra rootbeers.  Still was thinking about cancelling the order, but I was starving and decided to go forward.

Food finally gets here, almost 2hrs after I initially phoned in.  Was the food worth it?

I ordered the San Gennaro (meatball) pizza, and it was not very awesome.  It probably tastes a lot better fresh and in restaurant, but by the time I got it at work, it was soggy in the middle and the sauce is lacking taste.  Meatballs weren't bad, but nobody wants soggy pizza.

The wings and fries were mildly warm, the fries a bit undercooked and had that slightly starchy taste.  I was not a fan.

The rootbeer is awesome as always though.  They send it to you w\/o ice, and a cup of ice on the side, so it doesn't get watered down.  Thoughtful!  Probably shouldn't add a star for this, but I did.

Don't expect anything fancy.  This place is the antithesis of the new, modern places on the strip.  But the people are decent, the tables are cheap (all $5) and it's a good place to go to escape the bougie folks if you just want to grab some grub and play some craps.

The steak special goes like this: you get a good sized steak, potatoes, green beans, soup or salad, and a beer for $8. AWESOME deal, but if only the quality was as good as the price. Can't have the bet of both worlds right?

I had a soup, which was Cream of Mushroom at the time. A bit watered down and lacked salt, but not too bad. The steak is where they just went downhill, but I really wasn't expecting anything better from such a place. It lacked any marination, was all burnt on the outside, and was just overall bland and charred. The mashed potatoes were great, though.

Also, they may claim to be the best brewery in Vegas, but I highly dispute that. Their dark beer was heavily watered down, was way too bitter for such a beer, and just didn't go with the meal at all.

In conclusion, get their mashed potatoes. Everything else sucks.",3,1,0

For 2008, I would like to nominate them for ""Best Bang For Your Buck Restaurant."" Does that category exist? No? Too bad, I'm making it happen.

An Enterprise Rent-A-Car employee at the nearby Westin Casuarina Hotel suggested that we go to Ellis Island when we asked her for a place to eat. It was just half a block down. Upon entering, I was enveloped with cigarette smoke. I hate the smell of cigarettes and all of its carcinogenic qualities. That was a very bad first impression. However, that was the only bad impression that this place left on me.

We went to their restaurant area and I almost couldn't believe my eyes when our waiter handed us the menus. Everything on the menu was incredibly cheap! I had never seen so many items on a menu that were below $10 before! But then my instincts kicked in and wondered if the price fit the quality of the food. ""You get what you pay for"" has always been my philosophy with anything you can buy. I was hoping they would give me the benefit of the doubt.

It was mid-morning so I decided to order their Ellis Island Classic Omelet with ham. I got it with bacon and it also came with toast and potato...potato...errrr...""silver dollar potatoes."" That's the best way I can describe them. What can I say...they shut me up. The breakfast was surprisingly tasty and fulfilling! The omelet wasn't overcooked and was filled with chopped ham. It was the best $5.99 I've spent, that's for sure! Oh, and how could I have almost forgotten about their orange juice.

""What? WTF is so awesome about orange juice?""

Baby, this orange juice was the shiiiiiiiit!!! It's totally fresh squeezed, homey!! But if it wasn't really fresh squeezed, I'd like to thank Tropicana for making some damn good OJ!! Get the large OJ, you won't regret it.

UGHHH!! I don't know where to begin!! Metro pizza?!?! That cutie behind the counter tossing the dough in the air? Yes, he caught my eye. LMAO! He may have been the reason I bought a whole pie right after I just ate some ribs and chicken from the dining area next door. lol JK! He wasn't the reason, although he was easy on the eyes.  
Okay in all seriousness, (hehe) Metro pizza is one of the best pizzas I've ever had in my life... Real talk. Thin crust, melt-y velvety cheese, crispy pepperoni and mushrooms that were just mushrooms. haha. There is something about their sauce that just had a BITE to it. Nothing like I've ever tasted before.. very yummayyy!  I loved how they sprinkled pepper on top the pizza too.. totally complements the crispy crust. They don't skimp you on the toppings nor do they overload it.. Whatever they are doing to their pizza they are doin' ittt rightttt..  these guys knowww pizza. 

The BBQ restaurant is separated from the main cafe.  Honestly, my sis and I were too hungry to wait 45 mins. for a table there so we got a table at the cafe.. After finding out we couldn't get ribs at the cafe we got up and decided to just wait it out.  It was worthhhh the 45 min. wait.  They only have 2 items on the menu.  Chicken and Ribs.  We all got combos.  It came with 2 pieces of garlic bread, side of beans, cole slaw and corn on the cob. I don't remember the prices, I'm thinking it was about $16.99.  That's like a super deal.  They give you half a freak'n chicken and half a slab of ribs.. I was a bit hesitant about getting the chicken because most of the time, BBQ chicken is dry and a chewie.. But did this place prove me wrong.  My bf never eats chicken breast but he loved it.  It was so moist and juicy. Amazing.  Ribs pulled off the bone easily.  Sauce was perfect to my tasting.  Not too heavy and thick..  If your a fan of rootbeer, try it here.  They brew their own beer and rootbeer. :)
I can't say much about the service.  There were only 2 men working the rest.  Seating people, taking orders and serving food.  They checked on all their tables when they had a free hand.  Very friendly guys!!

I'd hate to let the secret out.. it would be a shame if this place were to be flooded by tourist and such, I'm sure Mr. Elvis wouldn't appreciate it. haha.(If you've been there, you know exactly who I'm talking about. Sweet man.)  Will I be back?!?! MOS. DEF.. OVER & OVER & OVER AGAIN.",1,0,1

The rib\/chicken place is simplicity.  You got three choices, full rack, 1\/2 chicken or 1\/2 rack and 1\/4 chicken.  BBQ sauce is sweet (like I like it) and the chicken and ribs fall off the bones.  For the $15 bucks (in Vegas, BABY), this is the best deal we had in our last two visits.  The corn on the cob was horendous, but, hey, it's about the MEAT, right?  Reviews which look to be all four or five stars.  

Can't say anything about the regular restaurant; although I hear it is the place that cabbies go when at break\/after shifts.  A good sign for decent cheap eats.  

Bads are only the corn (yuck, but out of season) and, like everywhere else in Vegas, the smokers abound.  Although not so much, it seems, this last visit.

Be aware that they smother lots of butter on it so if you are watching your saturated fat intake make sure to ask them for no butter on your toast. Home fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

I love their home made root beer. It was around $2.25 for a giant glass (probably 20 ounces).

Lunch you must try their 50\/50 burger which is Angus and Bacon!!  Yes, the perfect combo of a meat patty.  Then wash it down with their draft pint beer for $2.25.  They brew it themselves and is quite amazing flavor with 4 kinds of tap to choose from.  Dinner I had one of the best prime rib dinners ever.  I've gone to a lot of steak houses but this place at $15 is an absolute steal and deliciousness.  Give it the top award for value and flavor hands down.  Sorry Ruth Chris.  It is between a 16-20 ounce cut and cooked to perfection.  Photo's other's posted doesn't do justice to the amazing taste of this prime rib.  Service is always friendly and the restaurant is always packed with locals - Yes, the locals KNOW where to get the bargains and real dining experience of flavorful food.

- Country fried chicken $8. My boyfriend ordered this and it was delicious! Probably one of the better chicken fried steaks I've had. The chicken was cut thick and moist.

- NY Strip Steak and eggs special $6.99. I order this medium well and got it done correctly on one end and well done on the other, not a huge deal, still really good and not burnt or dry.

Food: Probably best value in town.
-Beers: $1.50 beers 24\/7 from their microbrewery. What a steal!
-Prime Rib: Thick cut of juicy, fatty prime rib with jous. Comes with string beans, baked potato, simple salad, and beer(!). Quite possibly the best meal I've had for $12.99.
-Steak & Eggs: Huge piece of sirloin with eggs and breakfast potatoes. Sirloin was not seasoned and actually too tough for my taste. But it was $10 so imperfections are forgivable.

Wait: I called around 7pm on a Friday and they told me the wait would be about an hour. When I asked when they'd slow down, they said 3pm-4pm or  midnight. ;) Needless to say, expect a long wait on weekend nights. 

Atmosphere: Feels like a family diner. Friendly quick service.

Casino: Great way to kill time and lose money. $5 blackjack. Slot machines galore. Don't get suckered in like we did. They let you sit at the slot machines even if you're not playing.

First off the cafe.  $5.99 Steak and Eggs breakfast special.  2 eggs, buttered toast, home fries and a 8 oz steak.  $5.99!!!!!  I went in thinking it was too good to be true, there must be a catch!   The steak is probably some overcooked piece of expiring supermarket aisle chuck steak, right?   Noooooooooooooooo... this steak is magical!  It's a thick cut of meat, cooked to perfection.  Charred on the outside, just a little pink on the inside.  Fatty meat, juices oozing out, tender loving care by the mouthful.  Quite possibly the best steak on the strip-- certainly better than the $70 wagyu I had at Jean Georges Steakhouse (seriously guys, dipping sauces for your steaks?)

Second, the smokehouse.  $13.99 for a full rack of ribs, garlic bread, brisket and beans and coleslaw.  These are some quality, falling off the bone ribs.  Not the overcooked kind, but the juicy meat with smokey flavor and just a touch of sauce.  Need to wash that down?  How about a $2 beer?  any beer.  Try the Amber Ale...

Note that their beers are also available at the Village Pub in the LV airport.
The bar is set very low when it comes to breweries in Las Vegas, so within that context their beers are average. The Amber is my favorite, and has a strong caramel flavor, slightly sweet finish, no hopping to speak of. The light is essentially Bud\/MGD but made locally. Nothing special. The Weiss features only minimal wheat, clove, spice fruity flavors, so think American wheat beer rather than German hefeweizen. The stout is a slightly less roasty Guiness, easy to drink though, and the IPA is nothing of the kind. Last time I had it I thought it was the light at first. The IPA has really little to no bitterness, hop flavor or aroma. 20 IBUs perhaps? Don't expect much from it if you are a craft beer drinker.

No matter how heavily intoxicated or hungover you are, eating here will still be a mistake.

Now don't get me wrong, I came in here with a positive attitude. Who wouldn't be excited for a legit meal that would cost me less than $10 especially in Vegas!

So I was unsure as to why we waited 45 minutes for a table. Nevertheless, I brushed that aside, retaining my hope and ready for my 4 star meal. We all ordered the steak special. Simple right? Well no, because we waited an hour and a half for all our food. We were starving at this point. And when the food finally came, I just wanted to eat. Except, my knife could barely cut through my steak. It was so well done that the slab of meat on my plate was just hot rubber. I managed to eat half of my meal because I needed something to just keep my stomach as ease. But I was definitely not satisfied. Come to think of it, I don't think anyone at our table was happy with their meal. Some of my friends even went over the gas station next door to buy a bag of chips because of the emptiness Ellis Island left us with.

As much as you can find the high end of things, you can equally find the lower end. When I say lower end, I don't mean cheap as in quality -- I am talking about bargains. Lost a lot of money on one of those rigged slot machines? Highly unlikely. Nobody in their 70′s reads my blog. You probably lost money on the Black Jack tables -- maybe in a rough game of Hold'em? Either way, just because you lost al of your money, doesn't mean you can eat like you won big. Ellis Island Casino and Brewery is a small casino just barely off the strip on Koval Lane. The casino isn't much, but the restaurant and brewery inside is another story. Filled with cheap, yet quality food and beer, it is a Vegas-er's must for those on a tight budget.

I had the king cut prime rib. With a side of green beans and baked potato, the dish was a great balance of protein, carb, and greens. The prime rib was bloody red and fatty. This made for a juicy cut of beef and made me happy. With the fat running down the middle and the side of ajus, this was definately a juicy everything.  Topping it all off with their horseradish made everything perfect. The name ""King Cut"" suggests that this was a uber thick cut -- it wasn't. I mean, it's no Diamond Jim Brady Cut from Lawry's. Don't get me wrong, it was still pretty thick. At then end of it all, it was a large piece of meat that had a lot of flavor. For the ridiculous price of something like $12. Considering the price, I'd say the prime rib was pretty dang thick. Just get two and you have your thicker than thick prime rib right there, for 24 bucks! Did I mention the prime rib comes with a beer? I opted for something light -- the Hefe Weiss ale was perfect. What more can I ask for than a huge prime rib and beer?

Ellis Island Casino and Brewery also has steak and eggs on the cheap too. For 6 bucks, you get an 8oz new york strip steak, eggs, toast, and your side of potato. The home fries were great with the eggs and toast, but the steak was the star. Of course, a lot less juicy than the prime rib, this was a true steak nonetheless. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, the lean cut of beef was at its purest. Did I dare ask for some A-1 sauce? I don't care what you say, that stuff is liquid gold. Not like we are at a fancy shmancy place. But really, for 6 bucks you get all this? Only in Vegas.

I guess you can lose all your money in Vegas and still come out on top. Imagine if this same establishment, minus the casino came to Los Angeles, That would be nut! The same thing at a Denny's or Sizzler would be double the price. You just can't have this anywhere else but in Las Vegas. Ellis Island Casino as a casino is pretty run down.

Your huddled masses yearning to be free""* - 
or eat for 6.99

Different restaurants in casinos attract different clientelle.  The Wynn's 'Alex' gets the high rollers that flew in to Vegas on their private jets and are chauffeured around in limos.  For the rest of us, flying coach and willing to walk to dinner, The Ellis Island Casino and Brewery restaurant is ""the lamp beside the golden door.""*

The restaurant is as no-frills as it gets.  They didn't even give it a name, it's just 'restaurant'.  Originally decorated in 1970s red vinyl, they know you came for the food - not to lick the walls.

Like most Yelpers, I got the 6.99 steak special - it's not on the menu, but it's no secret either.  It was on the marquee outside.  Despite reading the (mostly) great reviews, I was expecting a sorry excuse for a steak.  What I got was a flame-grilled surprise.  

The salad led the meal and set the bar low - as iceberg with carrots, tomatoes, and crutons out of a box will do, but the entree quickly saved the day.  The steak was the quality you might make at home (assuming you can grill).  A little singed where the flame kissed it, but medium rare (as ordered) inside.  The baked potato came with sour cream and butter, another homestyle staple, but the green beans were good enough to be served in a $25 a plate steakhouse.

The wait was about 30 minutes, but you are in a casino.  You're not sitting on a cramped couch or standing in a tiny atrium with newspaper box and 2 gumball machines.  Head into the sportsbook and watch some tv, cheer with people at the craps table, maybe even gamble a little - I think they count on waiting patrons to lose enough money to make up for the low cost of the meal.

So who are you?

If you wish to ""Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp""* then Ellis Island restaurant is a low 2 star joint.  If you are ""The wretched refuse of your teeming shore""* and are not afraid of ""the homeless, tempest-tost to me""* then Ellis Island (which is not located anywhere near the New York, New York Casino) is a solid 5-star facility.  I lie somewhere in between, but still give it a 4.

* If you are a (non-native) American and are not familair with these lines, shame on you.  Go to the Statue of Liberty (on the real Ellis Island) and learn exactly why this country is great.",0,0,0

i hate grading businesses poorly, but wow, the two beers i tried were bad. 

when i went, five beers were on tap: the hefeweizen, amber, stout, an ipa and i can't remember the fifth. the ipa is a new brew i was not expecting to find. as i've got a new found love of ipa's, i think my excitement showed in my face when the bartender mentioned they had an ipa. he quickly said, ""i don't think it's strong enough."" i wasn't sure what he meant, so i asked, ""not strong enough in terms of hoppiness or abv?"" he said it's not very hoppy.

he gave me a sample and he was right. no hops at all, tasted like a lager. pass. now that i think about it, if he told me it was a lager, i probably wouldn't have minded it. i got the stout next, and while it was marginally better than the ipa, there just wasn't much flavor at all. i was so disappointed i considered abandoning the unfinished glass, but thought that would be rude.

Two is the Karaoke Bar. That being said, this place is awesome if you want to get away from the strip but do not want to travel too far. The old establishment looks a bit run down considering strip standards but hidden inside is an oasis of craziness that one would expect from Vegas locals.

The Café is a great place to catch a decent meal for a good price. I would definitely recommend their steak special which isn't advertised on the menu and is priced very cheap. I can't remember the price as it sits now, but it used to be 6.99 and I hear the price has risen due to the increased popularity of this ""secret"" order. Anywho, its cheap its edible and will fill you up. Don't expect it to be within ""Flemings"" steak house standards but it'll get the job done. It comes with soup or salad, a side of vegetables, your choice of carbs (mashed potatoes, baked potato, rice, fries, etc.), an in house brewed beer or root beer, and of course the freaking steak. Sit down, eat, and enjoy the sounds of people singing karaoke next door. Often times you'll hear some great voices, some not so great voices, and some people that sound like two dying cats.
Which moves on to favorite part number two of this place...

The Karaoke Bar!!! What can I say it's a public Karaoke spot on stage with DJ and a bar. What's not to love. Drinks are priced well enough in order to get your dose of liquid courage before you embarrass yourself on the front stage before everyone else. Don't worry there are a lot of people who are going to embarrass themselves so you won't be the only one. The crowd is amazing and friendly and everyone is there to have a great time. So go!

I'll begin with the positive- their yearly Holiday Nog. It's a limited availability special drink that is a boozy, noggy delight! After missing it for a few years, I returned a few days before Xmas to get me some. 

And on the negative side- My first stop was at the Player's Club to redeem some coupons. There were no employees working there because they were ALL at a staff meeting. OK..........so I went to the cashier where they can get you a card, but still needed my T-shirt & promo play from my coupons. I then went to the bar near the BBQ restaurant for my Nog. This is where it gets bizarre. I ordered a glass of the nog from the (supposed) bartender, who could see that I was going to play. He gave me the nog, then another bartender walked out & I guess told him they can't comp the nog. She said to me, you're good. Well, that's great, since I'd already taken a sip & wasn't giving it up! I recall this same scenario going down years ago at the same bar!!!  They used to comp the nog if playing, I believe. 
I won this round with no loss on video poker & the free nog. 

I was able to redeem my coupons shortly thereafter at the player's club. There was a lot of chatter there about why they all went to the meeting & left the club unmanned. I played my $10 promo play & won that round too- up $20 and a free winter spiced ale (Very tasty!) from the free kiosk game. 

Aside from the must try egg nog, the beer prices (about $2 for a large glass) are probably worth a visit. The cafe also has a steak special for under $10- price can vary if you have a player's card or not, and it comes with a draft beer or root beer. I've had this meal a few times & it's a great deal. The casino was recently remodeled, and I noticed right away. It's brighter & less smoky! They installed a ton of ceiling fans, and the new floor is pretty nice too. 
Here's a great tip- All Village Pubs also serve the holiday nog. So avoid the shiftyness I endured and just go there instead. 

On their Web site, I spotted this- Free Brewery tours- Email Christina at cellis@ellisislandcasino.com. Let me know how that goes.",3,1,1

BBQ- the BBQ place is a must stop for my aunt when she comes to Vegas, she was the one that turned us onto the BBQ joint here and she's a caterer so knows her food.  But the portions are HUGE for what you pay and we're talking lip smacking good BBQ

One star for being open late, one star for being cheap, one star for quick service, and one star for decent food.  You seriously get what you paid for. The food that we ordered were not on the menu, but they definitely do serve it.

$3.99- Scrambled eggs, potatoes, toast with butter, and medium well steak:
I didn't want to eat too much so I opted for the steak and egg. It was definitely not of best quality.  Next time, I will definitely pay $2 more for the better version.

One of the awesome specials they offered was a steak dinner for 9.99 which included a steak veggies a side salad a potato and a beer (they have a brewery on site). Unfortunately now they stopped giving you a beer with the special. I'm sure if you're still reading this you're probably saying it sounds like a great special even without the beer. And your probably right, but as a patron that's had the special with the beer let me tell you.... it makes a difference. Suddenly this spot has lost some of its appeal. Maybe I'll get over it but as of right now I'm still a little salty. Needless to say I didn't get the steak tonight I had the chicken parm. It was okay nothing to rave about.  I guess this place is still great for cheap food just slightly less great since the change in their specials.",2,1,1

I ended up hanging out at The Ellis Island Casino & Brewery on several occasions. Just walk 1 block off the strip behind Ballys. The food and beer here was the highlight. 20 oz. glasses of beer, brewed there on the premises for $1.50. You cant beat that! I especially liked the Weiss. In comparison, a bottle of Heineken at Planet Hollywood (where I was staying) costs $7.00.

I ate there twice. Once in the restaurant and once in the BBQ restaurant. I had the steak special (comes with a beer for $6.99) and the rack of ribs ($11.99) [both recommended on Yelp.] Both dinners were fantastic! Well worth the money and the wait. We had to wait about an hour to get into the BBQ restaurant.

The karaoke was fun but was pretty crowded both times I went. The song selection was decent, but on the nights I was there, there was a problem with the machine and many of the songs weren't working. They claim it is the best Karaoke in Vegas but I doubt it. I would only say that it was ok. 

The casino was fun. There are loads of slot machines. There are a couple blackjack tables but no poker. 

There are a lot of older folks and regulars hanging around this place. I didn't see any drunks or homeless people in here (as stated in other reviews). This place is old school Vegas. Its kinda dumpy and smoky, but thats the way I like it. Overall, I had a great time at Ellis Island Casino & Brewery. I would highly recommend it to anyone!",3,0,1

Thankfully, we did not and he asked where we were headed.  We said that we had wanted to grab some breakfast before our family activities and he said, ""Forget the buffets, go down the street to Ellis Island!  I swear it's a local favorite and the only place I take my visiting friends and relatives for breakfast."" 

So we decided to take this stranger's advice and headed a bit off the Strip to what seemed to be a very depressing, realistic and non-glitzy part of Vegas.  But we braved the smokey filled casino and headed towards the restaurant in the back.  Needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised at the level of friendly service and delicious food.  Steak and eggs for $5?  Surely you jest.  But the steak was made to order, the eggs were tasty... actually, everything was tasty.  We could overhear people in other booths around us saying how this was the only place they ate breakfast whenever they were visiting, or how some were actually locals.

They offer a Hefe, a stout, and an IPA as well. I liked the Hefe but as a non-beer drinker, it can get to be a bit much after a glass or two. 

After coming here a few times just hanging at the bar, I decided to see what everyone else had to say about EI. I didn't know this place had good, cheap food as well. Thanks to Yelp, I found out they have some really decent prime rib and BBQ as well as some other great dishes. So far, I've had the chance to try their BBQ, which was really good and probably some of the best I've had here in Las Vegas. It was even better than this BBQ place I ate at in Houston. I've also had the prime rib twice now and although they are a little bit inconsistant with the temperatures, the meat is actually very tasty and is a great deal at just $12.99 which also includes beer. 

Ellis Island has got to be one of the last places in Vegas where you can find some good food and beer at great prices. Like how Vegas used to be.

Let's talk about the restaurant itself; it's located about one block away from the Strip, so it's relatively close to all the big hotels. If you're out on the Strip late at night, maybe just got done with clubbing or meeting some friends and want to get some grub at a decent price, this would be my first choice. Yep, and I said grub :) So don't expect any fine-dining steakhouse quality, but it's a great fixer at 2am in the morning when you don't want to settle with pizza or McDonalds.

In fact, I'd give the food more credit than just that. It's a lively little place to chat and enjoy a good dish while at it. The Steak and eggs portion are really great for the price. It's definitely filling and the steak is juicy and well-cooked. The service is what you expect at a casino; fast and friendly. 

My only complaint would be that Ellis Island is really showing its age. I don't know how old the building is but everything, including the casino, interior, and restaurant just seems a little aged. But of course, that can be charming as well, just depends how you look at it.

So where am I gonna go after I see Deadmau5 or Redfoo at Marquee at 2am in the morning? This place of course! Also, now that I think about it, it's probably even walking distance from Marquee (Although being a pedestrian at 2 in the morning on the Las Vegas Strip is probably not a good idea).",2,3,3

They also have a pizza spot which is really good (opposite end of diner) and a live karaoke bar as well. Every time I have friends in town I make sure to bring them here at least one night.

My aunt was in town staying at Harrah's, and we decided to come here for lunch since it is right down the street from her hotel. The wait on a Saturday afternoon for 4 was a little over 45 minutes. Our server was OK. My aunt ordered a club sandwich and fries well done, but the fries came out cold and soggy. My mother's fries were cold as well. When we told our waitress she said she would get us a fresh basket. Great =) She comes back not 2 minutes later and says ""I got you a new basket, but I don't know if they will be any better than the other ones."" Dafuq? And they were not any better than the fries we got the first time. Whyyyyyy wouldn't she just get us a fresh basket?? Super lame.I had the steak and eggs, mom had the fish and chips and grandma had a chef salad. 

Other than the fry incident, we were all satisfied with our meals. Nothing memorable about this place, just convenient to where my aunt was staying, and off the strip so that is always a plus!

Yeah, Ellis Island Casino & Brewery doesn't have all the shiny bells and whistles like the larger casinos, but it also doesn't have a drop of pretentiousness. You could literally come straight from the pool with a cover on and nobody would blink. The smallish space is separated into 3 main areas: casino (mostly penny slots, $5 roulette table, one craps table...), the karaoke bar (yup, even I would have shamelessly belted out ""Work it Bitch!"" - everyone having such a great time and absolutely no judgment - only claps and hoots of encouragement for even the worst crooner's), and the diner (seems like most people visit EIC&B more for the food - and beer - than to gamble; I'll get to that more in a bit). 

Casino: No bawlers to be found. Plenty of fun ways to drop a few bucks and still leave with money in your pocket. The machines are actually quite friendly and roulette [worst odds of all games] turned out be ""odds ever in my favor."" :D  

The Brewery: About 6 different beers brewed on site; can view tanks from the casino. Voted #1 brewing in Nevada by the National Brewer's Association, the micro-beers include Light, Amber, Weiss, Stout, IPA, a Seasonal Special, and even Root Beer. I personally didn't care for the Light; however, the Stout was legit and the husband enjoyed the IPA. And, if you're not interested in gambling, these large 20oz. draught pour will only set you back a mere $2.25 at the bar. Cheers! [free tours available by appointment]

The Karaoke Bar: Fairly large space, lots of seating including communal, loud as would be expected, filled with some of the happiest folks I've seen when visiting Sin City. One word: fun! 

The Diner (there is also pizza and BBQ stations on-site): Approximately 30 minute wait for table for 2 at around 11pm on a Tuesday night. They will take you cell number and you can spend your time entertaining yourself until you receive the text. Very convenient. Waiter: His ""Furk You, I'm too slammed to even let you finish a sentence and I don't care you're here"" attitude almost made me get up and walk out (note: all other staff, including hostesses were all really friendly). But everyone raved about the food, and we were already seated, so...the hubster and I weren't even hungry, but we really felt we would be remiss not to sample a menu item. Vast menu runs the gamut from 24hr breakfast to King Cut Prime Rib. Tried to order PR - out. Okay, The NY Strip & Shrimp for $12.49!: included a salad, thick 8oz. steak, about a half dozen decent sized shrimp, and choice of potato (baked - out, okay...home fries). The Furk You waiter was actually nice enough to bring out two separate salad plates (without even have been asked) since we were sharing the entrée. Massive serving of crisp iceberg, creamy dressing, and croutons. Simple salad. The steak had beautiful char marks on it and came out cooked spot on mid-rare. Surprisingly good flavor - quality easily superior to any chain steak house.  Perfectly breaded and fried shrimp were also a nice surprise. The home fries, frankly, sucked. Soggy, under-cooked, oh well. Overall, hell's yeah! Best bargain in Las Vegas! Future repeat offender here for sure!   

So glad a local buddy recommended this joint! The hubby and I are always looking for something new\/different to do (in Vegas or elsewhere) and we both love a good dive. Jackpot!!! ~$5 cab ride (or you can walk if  you so dare) from the The Strip you will find the true OG Ellis Island Casino and Brewery - reminiscent of the Fremont area when they first started revamping until it turned into the new mini-Strip over the last couple of years (merp!). Highly recommend. 

Note: It is a little disconcerting that there were so many security guards walking the interior - easily 10. Seemed safe to me, but there was that one couple who were a little too eager to be friendly, compliment me on my wedding ring, and eyeball my handbag when my hubby stepped away from where I was seated at the bar. What's up Slim Shady? So I guess, just be cognizant. I suppose I wasn't inebriated enough...yet. ;) Hey, it's Vegas baby!",28,23,27

This review is for the food though.  My husband and I were tired of going to the fancy restaurants on the strip and asked a local where the best food was in town.  He pointed us in the direction of Ellis Island and stated that he and his wife frequently go there, so we went for lunch.  SOOOO GOOOOD!  For lunch my husband got the 50\/50 burger and I just got the appetizer sampler.  I was expecting like 2 of each item on my sampler but I seriously got A HUGE amount of food.  Husband loved his burger as well.  While we were there the waitress told us about the steak and egg special for $7.99 every morning.  So what did we do?  Go back two days later for breakfast!

Breakfast at Ellis Island was just as good as lunch.  The portions were huge and the steak was cooked perfectly.  And it was $7.99!!!!!  Breakfast anywhere else in Vegas would cost you at least $15 per person!

There's probably a certain expectation you have when you come to Vegas, flashy lights, great food, and everything being expensive.

There was honestly a 40 minute wait just for a table of one! Of one! That's how popular this place is. Not really a hidden gem anymore, it still maintains the low key feel that you'll sorely be wanting after losing all your money in the flashier part of Vegas.

It isn't exactly the happiest place on earth but aside from the occasional smell of tapioca, it's home to the $6.99 Sirloin Steak special.  

My review is only for the ""Steak Special""  The ""Restaurant"" mostly been a hit with most locals and tourists on Yelp.  Tonight it was a BIG MISS!  I unfortunately got really sick after eating my steak with food poisoning symptoms.  And pretty much spent the rest of the evening in the oval office.

I had ordered it medium rare and it came out uhh medium well and a little burnt on the top.  I'll definitely take Andy T's suggestion and order it rare next time if I ever decide to come back.  His ball of flesh came out perfectly grilled and medium rare.  Oh and BTW the meal comes with your choice of soup of the day or your a-typical iceberg lettuce salad drenched with salad dressing (which may I note could've been the culprit that led to my ""closed door meetings""), potato, green beans....blah blah blah!

So this review is a little late however still applicable since this place doesn't seem to change much. Vegas is a city of decadence and imagination. In such a place it is rare that one finds a location for cheap eats of huge portions that isn't McD's or ::insert chain::. In that respect this place was amazing. It was like stepping into stereotype land. I wouldn't have been surprised if fear and loathing had of be-bopped thru this place in a tweaking, Hawaiian shirt clad rumble. If they had it would have been remise to not stop and devour some cheap eats.

It takes awhile to get a seat here, especially on Thur-Sun, but once your in its all gravy, or bread? Well that's what they start you with, tons of bread! They have several specials where you can get a main item and a beer or drink. This is a ridiculous deal. The beer is gigantic and so is the food. A side of beef with potatoes and veggies. Classic.

Potato

I've waited 2 hours to eat these ribs before. People  wait because it's good and filling; Corn, Bread, Beans and Ribs...the perfect meal. The beer is cheap and microbrewed...YES MICROBREWED (try the dark ale).

Update, "" No more glass of beer or root beer with the special"". You get or have your player's card, get a voucher from the kiosk, then the steak special is $9.99. 

If you play $5 in any machine with your card in you can get a 2nd voucher reducing the price to around $7. I guess they figure you're going to lose $5 anyway making the special $12. (9.99 + $5 - $3 = $12)

The beer is great. The ambiance is local dive but fun. Good gambling. All else is pretty much the same except the beer went up to $2.25 if you just buy it. Free if your gambling with a minimum buy in, around $20 at full coins ($1.25) on quarter VP and slots, and all table games.",2,0,0

Depending on when you go, you have two choices:

$4.99 Steak, eggs, hash-browns and toast
(Only on Weekdays 11pm - 11am; Weekends 11am - 2pm.)
Or 
$7.99 Steak special. Comes with veggies, mashed potatoes(or fries or baked) and a beer\/root beer.

We were here twice and both times I had the $7.99 special. The mashed potatoes were damn good. The steak was perfectly medium rare (though my other friends were not as lucky, so it's kind of a hit\/miss but they come fairly close to what you order). Their hefeweizen was alright.

The best part about this place is that you can eat for free. I'm not sure if it was a special or not, but after we ate, we went to the other side of the casino and signed up for the membership. It's free to signup and you get $10 of free game play. You play a bit and you have a chance of winning a couple of bucks, then just cash out and you just got yourself a free dinner. :)

I'm definitely going to come back to this place.",5,3,7

For $5, the steak and egg combo really hit the spot.  The char on the steak was divine and the potatoes were nice and crisp.  For $4 you can get biscuits and gravy with eggs and a choice of sausage or bacon.  I thought their country gravy was pretty tasty last time I had it.

Chicken and ribs were very good.  Wife did not like the beans which were watery (but I thought tasty).  We were given plastic fork, knife & spoon which made eating difficult.  (Try slicing meat with a plastic knife.)  Corn was pretty bad.

We ended up going back there for 2 breakfasts (mid-week BTW) and had no trouble getting in.  My wife was very happy with hers.   I had omelets both times and 1st was good and 2nd was passable.  Good toast (no small thing) and breakfast potatoes.

We did play slots there quite a bit.  My wife ended up breaking even (including losses at the big casinos) and I didn't lose too much with several hours of play.

Ellis is a 1 (Vegas) block walk from Bally's by a less than delightful fenced off, abandoned parking lot.  A couple of street people (junkies?) seem to sit out by the 7-11, but no trouble.  My wife was glad I was with her.

Not really busy while we were there so smoke was not a problem, but it's one thing I hate about casinos.  I wonder why non-smokers have so few (or no) options?  Do smokers lose more???

Ellis Island is barely a MOTEL and casino, everything looks old and beat up (not to mention the staff and dealers). Don't expect fancy decor or the hootin' and hollerin' of young 20-something's, most of the customers and gamblers are middle aged or senior citizens.

The actual restaurant made me feel like I was in the 70's where mafiosos came to dine. There is usually a minimum 30 minute wait, but it's all good because they'll call your number while you walk around and gamble.

It was absolutely delicious and I've been a dedicated Ellis Island lover ever since. This casino is definitely a locals spot. Many of the smaller casinos are. The larger ones tend to attract the tourists, not to say that Ellis Island doesn't have its share of tourists, either, but most people visiting stay on the strip. Ellis Island is located just behind the strip; behind MGM Grand. Besides being known for their BBQ, they are also known for their beer, as they brew it on the grounds. They even make their own root beer. A long time ago, the BBQ restaurant was located right in front of the vats and if you ate outside, you used to be able to walk through there to the outside space they had set up in the parking lot. 

The establishment is definitely small and there is no hotel attached, even after all these years, however there is a motel that shares the same parking lot. They have plenty of parking around the building and if that's full, they have a decent parking structure. Make sure to get their players club card because you get daily discounts on the food at the café or BBQ, and I believe certain specials on the drinks. Staff is pretty friendly, so no issues there for me. It can get extremely smokey in there, but that's because it's really small in there.",32,21,24

The food was very reasonably priced and well prepared. I had the wild Alaskan salmon which I was happy to see on the menu (most restaurants use cheaper and less healthful farmed Atlantic salmon), I wanted it to be left a tiny bit rare in the center, which they almost accomplished, that's ok though it was good, and salmon can be difficult to get perfect. My wife had a burger, requested it as rare as they would make it, and they accomodated by bringing her a rare burger. This surprised me. I don't do rare ground meats unless I am certain about the source, but that is my wife's preference, she said it was good, but a bit bland. I think I have spoiled her by feeding her only grass-fed beef or game meat burgers at home.

As for the house brews, I tried the amber (or 3 or 4) as that sounded like the most flavorful offering available at the time. It was a good amber with a hint of hoppiness, I would have loved to have had something with more hops but was satisfied, especially at the super low price for a decent pint of beer. I think it was $2 or less. My wife tried the homemade Root Beer, and said it was great. I had a taste and it tasted like a pretty good sweet root beer.

By the time we finished dinner the karaoke lounge was packed, we sat in the smoke and looke at the songbooks for a little while. I love a good karaoke spot, this place has good music choices, but unless you already smoke like 2 packs a day, the thick smoke in the air is going to kill your throat before you get a chance to sing. The regular older elvis guy was kinda funny. The other thing I would change if the ventalation could be addressed, is the sound system volume. It seems it was tuned up for those already hearing impaired or looking to become such, my ears were ringing after about 20 minutes. Perhaps if we got there earlier we could have found a spot near the air inlet and a little farther away from the speakers and got a song or two in before we left. Will try again next trip.",0,0,0

There are some really amazing singers.  We went on a Tuesday night so it started off pretty dead so the rotation went quickly and we got to sing about 3 times each.  As the night wore on, it got more packed and by midnight we were sure we weren't going to get to sing again.  The ambiance and the crowd just makes singing so much fun!  They cheer you on and dance and sing along.  The sound system is great too.  They have TVs all over the bar with the lyrics displayed.  They also seem to have a good selection of music.

We went back on a Friday night and that place was PACKED to the hilt.  We put our names in and ended up having to wait about 1 1\/2 hours to sing.  It was still a TON of fun.

The deal that they have (12 oz cut, two sides, a salad, and a 20 oz beer) is low cost and absolutely delicious.  I have never done any gambling there so I cannot comment on that, but boy is that prime rib something else.",1,0,0

Review for the restaurant - 
$7.99: 10-ounce steak. Includes salad or soup, potato, bread, green beans and a beer 

Our server was MIA most of the time. Took well over 40 minutes for our dinner to come out. Some of the tables that were seated well after us were either eating, or getting their checks before we saw our dinner. 

Steak - Both of us ordered Medium Rare. J's was almost blue. Seared but still very pink in the center. But it was warm to the touch, so he decided to not send it back. Now this I cant understand. You almost under-cook a steak, but its still tough!? How do you accomplish that feat?! My steak on the other hand was more on the well done side than medium rare. Terrible. I took maybe 2 bites. I'm sure boot leather would have tasted better. J ate maybe 1\/4 of his steak. He's a huge steak fan, so that's gotta show you that something is wrong. 

Salad (mine) - You can't really screw up a salad. 
Soup (J's) - He said it was ""alright"". 

Baked Potato - This was the best part of the whole meal. 

Green Beans - This was a tie for the best part of the meal. Lots of garlic, which J and I love. 

Bread - Love sourdough, but this was almost inedible. 

Beer - J ordered an Amber. Since I do not drink, I asked if I could have a diet soda. No Dice. So I ordered a beer and gave it to J. And just stuck with water. 

He said just for the beer's alone, it was almost worth $7.99 a piece. If we could have had a Mr. Lucky's steak with Ellis Island's Baked Potato and Green Beans, we would have been happy campers. 

Will we return to Ellis Island for eats? Maybe, but probably not to the restaurant. We might try the BBQ or Pizza joint next time. 

Now for the casino review - 

Very friendly and helpful dealers. I mentioned to J that if he wanted to learn to play craps, now was his chance. When there were other players, there were maybe 1-2 tops. The craps dealers were all very helpful on teaching him the ropes. With $80, J played easily for 2 hours. Left being down only $30. Not too shabby!!",1,1,0

Ellis Island seems to have a reputation for killer karaoke. But what is it that ultimately got me to take a trip to Ellis Island? A video from Vice's Youtube channel, Munchies. In the video, Ellis Island is explored as one of the (cheap) places to hang out at. So off we were to our $9.99 steak special to see if it was as good as the video made it out to be. Honestly, it wasn't. And it wasn't even $9.99!

When we initially entered Ellis Island we were taken back by how big the establishment is. I was imagining it to be a medium to large dive bar... this place is (obviously, as I later discovered) a ""full size"" casino. There are table games and slots on slots on slots - after all, I am in Las Vegas. Karaoke was alive and well. In case you're wondering, karaoke is in a separate room to the left from the main entrance. The Munchie segment had mentioned signing up for their player's card and getting free slot play, so that's what we did. I was disappointed that I wasn't cool enough to get the porcelain chicken, but the free play was a nice score. Naturally, I won nada. The player's card sign up was pretty easy and didn't take too long even though there were two of us signing up.

There are a couple restaurants to choose from inside Ellis Island, most of them were closed when we arrived though. The café was very much opened and exactly where we wanted to go to try their food. The prices are pretty cheap considering Ellis Island's proximity to The Strip. I was adamant about trying the steak special but my boyfriend got a French toast dish. The steak was pretty thin and a bit dry in places and chewy in others, overall it wasn't horrible... perhaps I just had my expectations raised after watching that show. My boyfriend's French toast was pretty darn good though! Ellis Island has their own brews so I tried the Amber Ale which also wasn't bad...especially for $2.

Overall, Ellis Island is pretty fun escape from The Strip... and it's not ridiculously far away so I will encourage tourists seeking a ""different"" Vegas experience to visit. I still want to go back and fulfill my karaoke needs and will be sure to post an update to this review on that experience, but for now... BYE, BYE, BYE!",1,0,1

The BBQ meats are ribs and chicken only, no choice of sides tho you do get beans, cole slaw, corn on the cob and garlic French bread with every entree.

I was pretty blown away.. The meats were incredibly juicy, tender and tasted like the most awesome back yard BBQ. The chicken was like eating meat silk, you hardly even needed to chew since it was that soft. Ribs were meaty and just barely clung to the bone (thats a good sign for BBQ).

However, I have to take into account the antiquated decor and the ever present smell of cigars and cigarettes.  The dining room is very dark with red vinyl\/pleather seating.  On top of that, the service can be slow at times.

That being said, I make it a point to stop here on every trip to Vegas.  Usually, immediately after getting off of the plane at around 10am Vegas time.  Upon first site, it really isn't much.  Ellis Island is hooked onto a Super 8 Motel; which in itself, doesn't exactly make you think of award winning micro-brewed beer and excellent food.  

This place definitely has the feel of ""Old Vegas"" when it comes to the $6 Steak (big) and Eggs along side a $1 beer brewed on site.  The menu is wide ranging.  You'll find everything from basic spaghetti to chicken fried steak on the dinner menu and slabs of ham the size of your head for breakfast!

The Ellis Island microbrewery is on site and makes a few excellent brews.  My favorite is the stout...and for $1 you can't go wrong here.  

If you're looking for somewhere cheap (because nothing else in Vegas is!) to start your trip while you wait for the 2-3pm hotel check-in time look no further.

I was told about this place by my bro inlaw.  He read on the internet that this place claimed to be one of the best out here on in the west.

On to the food.  If you are looking for real BBQ, look else where.  If you are looking for tasty food at a low price, this place may be for you.  Their menu consists of three items: full rack of ribs, half rack of ribs, and half bbq chicken half rack of ribs.  All entrees come with corn on the cobb, cole slaw, baked beans, and toast with butter.

I got the half bbq chicken half rack of ribs.  I should mention the ribs are baby back ribs.  The cost was $8.99.  

The bbq chicken was moist, the sauce was good.  The ribs were really moist and the sauce was good.  

Here's the deal, there is no smoke flavor, none at all that I could have distinguished either on the chicken or ribs.  There was no smoke ring on the meat of the ribs.  The ribs were missing that slight tug when the meat comes off the bone of a rib that was cooked slow and low on a bbq.  Did the meat fall off the bone?  Yes it did, but more like how the meat falls off the bone when you boil the ribs so they're tender or how meat falls off the bone when you braise something or similar to it.  And yes, I really do think they boil the ribs first as there was no real pork flavor.

The chicken was akin to tender broasted chicken from say Costco or Boston Market, except is had BBQ sauce on it.  Was it good? Yes, but it wasn't legit BBQ chicken.

The sides were less than stellar.  The corn on the cobb was limp.  All the kernels were not plump.  The majority of the juiciness was probably from the pot of water they used to boil the corn.  The cole slaw was fine, it would have been better if it had more of the dressing mixed in, but it was fresh and crunchy still.  The baked beans were on the verge of being flavorful.  The slices of bread they gave me were rye, they tried toasting it, but they still couldn't save it from being stale bread it was.

Didn't try the beer so I can't comment on the legitimacy of their brewery.

I like sauce and their BBQ sauce managed to make the food tasty, at least in my opinion it did.  It could have used more sauce though...

Dont expect to have a gourmet meal on this menu but its decent hardy food at VERY affordable prices and you will leave full. I look forward to trying the ribs that everybody is talking about. And if there is a guy on stage getting way into singing ""eye of the tiger"" during Karaoke, tips are appreciated... thank you.",1,1,0

After Drai's we were wanting a good and inexpensive steak and eggs.  Luckily before hopping into the cab, the attendant had recommended Ellis Island, especially after I told him we were interested in going to Marilynn's for the steak and eggs.  Thanks to that kind gentleman, I now have a new place to go to for $5.99 steak and eggs.  Service was quick and kind, and the steak and eggs wasn't so bad either.  The potatoes could have been better, but because of the great deal, it didn't matter so much to me.  It's not stated in the menu that the steak and eggs is $5.99 but it is.

The dive bar vibe is great and all the patrons are laid-back.  It's a great place to sing karaoke for the first time because everyone gets into it, but not too into it.  If you forget the song, the MC will help you out.  The wait to sing can be kinda ridiculous sometimes, but we all know attaching something green to your request speeds up the waiting game.  And the MC will get to your song eventually.  Even though karaoke only goes til 3am officially, it usually always goes longer.

A sour note from the other night: we sat down at a booth and since a cocktail server didn't come around, I went to the bar to get our drinks and he told me that I should go back and she'll be there soon.  Um, wtf?  Obviously, ""soon"" wasn't soon enough for me...so just fulfill my drink request without any side commentary...thanks!  

Also, I know it's a bar and people are smoking, but the ventilation system in here needs to be redone ASAP!!  I go to various bars and clubs often, and never wake up the next day feeling like a I smoked 2 packs of cigarettes the night before!  Infact, the smokiness is a reason why I won't make going there a habit.  Feeling sick from all the smoke is NOT worth it!  Would give it 4 stars if not for the smoke...

For some reason, steak and eggs post-clubbing (or anytime after midnight) has always been a staple of my Vegas trips, so I've been to quite a few places. Skip Buffalo Bill's and go to Ellis Island! Trust me. Heard about it from a cab driver one Vegas trip, and we have been back every time since.

Location wise, it's off the strip a bit, but parking is generally not a problem (though again, only been here when it's... late), and I've also managed to hail a cab standing on the side of the road at 3am.

Our server was really patient with us, even though we had a big group. Service was surprisingly slow, given that it was mostly empty (-1 star), but they brought out 10 steak and eggs orders all at once so no one was waiting extra. This is the best steak and eggs deal in Vegas (for the price) because the steak is actually edible and not too tough to chew and the potatoes are seasoned well. Eggs are eggs. It's not gourmet, but when you're tired and hungry and in good company, tastes like heaven.

Also, beware the creepy guys on the casino floor who leer at girls in heels and short dresses.

We came back one morning before leaving Vegas and decided to give it another try since Marilyn's steak & egg special, unfortunately, is limited to the late night hours and butt crack of dawn.

There were several parties waiting ahead of us, but were seated within 5 minutes. Our server was especially busy but always smiling and friendly. The NY steak & egg special was $6.99, and came with toast and potatoes.

The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, juicy, but still had a good amount of fat\/gristle. The potatoes taste like Jack in the Box curly fries, but in square boxy form. Yum. The eggs were fine and the toast was buttered and ... toasty?

Orange juice will run you north of $3 and soda about $2. All in all, an excellent alternative to Marilyn's for steak & eggs in the daytime hours.",1,0,0

This place is located behind the strip and is the place to go if you want food on a budget. The casino and hotel itself is not impressive... it's technically a Super 8 motel with a casino across the way. The hotel rooms are located across from the casino. The casino is small, but inside there is a BBQ place, cafe, and pizza place. 

I like coming here for the BBQ. It's super cheap... and good!! I have yet to try the cafe, but I've heard lots of good things about it also. For the BBQ, I always get a full rack of ribs and it's only $13! It comes with 2 pieces of corn, 2 pieces of garlic bread, slaw, and baked beans. The ribs are tender and tasty. They also have a half rack of ribs for $10, but a full rack is more worth the cost! They also have 1\/2 ribs and 1\/2 chicken or you could also get a whole chicken. I've never tried the chicken but I love ribs so much that I've only ordered the ribs! You must sign up for the players card for the lower price however because it's $3 more without a players card. Also, if you gamble $1, you will get that dollar back as a $1 coupon of any item for either the cafe or BBQ place. Who knows, that may be the lucky dollar that you win lots of money from! Trust me, because I've put in $1 before, played 75 cents and came out with $250 with a single spin!
 
The promotion for new players now is to play $10 and you will get free play in the amount of $10-$500. It's worth it because technically you aren't gambling any money but you could win money! 

There is a parking structure at this casino. It's a small structure, but I've never had trouble finding parking. I've also never had a long wait for the BBQ. Maybe I've always beat the rush! On Sundays the pizza place is 2 for 1. 

Come here for the food. It wound disappoint! I would also like to say that for such cheap food, I've never had bad service here!

My family and I go here all of the time specifically for their steak which comes out perfectly every time. Ever since my family started eating here, it has been the only place we go out to to specifically order steak, of all the places in Las Vegas. I usually order the Steak and Shrimp and it is always a meal that fills me up and has me looking forward to eating my leftovers, I have leftovers every time because the portions are great, especially for the price. The dinner salad that comes with a majority of the items on the menu is a salad I always crave because their thousand island dressing is to die for. 

Their food is always freshly made and it's obvious that the chef put time in from preparing the food to plating. 

I recently tried their steak and eggs and fell in love. The portions were again, very big for the price, and the steak had great quality. The breakfast potatoes were light and crisp, and the eggs were perfect, and I'm not the usual egg eater. Even at 11 in the evening, none of our food tasted slacked.

As far as service, you can't expect too much coming from a cafe inside a casino. It was dimlitted and the hint of smoke is somewhat bothersome, but the food definitely makes up for it. Depending on how busy it is and what time it is, you will either have great service with the waiters constantly checking on you, or a waiter running around trying to do multiple things.

I give this place 5 stars because it is a great place to eat if you want to get full, and I constantly go back looking forward to a great meal.

I think it's funny when you are driving through the parking lot there is a sign that have the beer price and you can tell it's been changed many times.  I always joke with people that their beer prices are like the stock market.  

First let me talk about the beer.  They are pretty standard, Amber, IPA, Stout.  and you also have a root beer.  The beer isn't special but its a craft like beer that is cheap.  When you spend $12 on the strip for a 12oz corona you learn to appreciate this place.  They have a little lounge in the corner that has karaoke.  Let me warn you though,  it does tend to get pretty smokey on the weekends.  Also, every time I have been in the lounge there has been a homeless guy sitting at the bar.  Or, he might have been a truck driver.  Either way Ellis Island is for everyone!  It's not some secret hipster bar that serves strange drinks.

I was a little skeptical about this place on my walk here.  It's near the Super 8 motel and it is an older casino\/semi run down.  

There was a few minute wait for my party of 3 and there were a lot more people waiting for tables when I was finishing up my meal.  

We ordered:
   - burger with bacon and cheese + steak fries $6.99: pretty large burger and the bun was delicious and evenly buttered. Steak fries were bomb as well.  My bf ate my leftovers a few hours later (1\/3 burger and 1\/2 fries) and still said it was good. 

   - chicken with portobello mushrooms & rice $8.99: the rice is sooo flavorful! No additional seasoning needed here! Chicken chunks are cooked perfectly and the feta cheese gives the dish a nice kick. 

   - steak + baked potato + green beans + FREE home brewed root beer $7.99: the steak had no fat and was cooked the way it was ordered. My dad said the root beer was a little too sweet and didn't finish it. 

Our waiter, Eugene, was very friendly.  He answered my questions about the food and stuck with me through my indecisiveness...burger or steak.  Then he started to joke around with us too, so bonus for cool waiters.

A few tips: Despite the casino and cafe being open 24\/7, the BBQ is not.  They are open Sun-Thurs 4pm-10pm and 4pm-11pm Fri and Sat.  Also, don't plan on bringing your children as it's 21 and older.  When busy, the hostess will give you a notification buzzer so you don't have to stand nearby.

As a local for the past 10 years, I've eaten the BBQ countless times and it has remained consistently delicious.  About three years ago, the BBQ was relocated from the other side of the casino to its current position; wait times have been cut way down.  This time I waited 45 minutes on a Sunday night at around 7pm with my party of three.

One aspect I appreciate here is the simplistic menu.  You have 4 options as my menu pic will attest to.  Thankfully, no complicated 10 page menu.  I personally always pick the combo option (half chicken\/half baby back ribs).

The ribs are cooked to perfection with a delicious sauce that really adds to the flavor of the meat.  My only complaint (my personal preference) is that I cannot detect any smoke flavor.  Sadly, you won't see any beautiful pink smoke rings on this meat.  Frown.  The chicken is very tasty but have noticed it can be slightly dry.  Each entree is served on a very large black plate and includes 2 pieces of buttered garlic bread, an ear of corn (split in half), side of average tasting slaw and baked beans served with an Ellis Island based root beer sauce.

I finally decided on a 4 star rating as the service, while consistently friendly, can be on the slow side and it can be hard to get refills on drinks.  

But overall, I recommend and look forward to going back.",1,0,1

For example, we decided what to order while we waited for our seats and asked for the check immediately after the last plate landed on  the table. This was a speedy meal. 

I ordered the Steak and Shrimp and it was pretty damn good especially considering the price, which is $12.99 I believe? It came with soup or salad. The ambiance of the place is decent, Ive seen better decor in other restaurants. I came on a Monday and there was only 3 servers. The table next to us dine and ditch and that little fiasco slowed down the service for us.

First, I stopped by several years ago with my fam bam because Dad read that they had good pizza at Metro Pizza. My mom put one foot in the door and immediately turned around and said let's go.  We'll get back to this.

I came again around 7am a few nights ago for some steak and eggs, recommended by the valet at Artisan Boutique Nightclub\/Hotel, and by our cab driver.  This is apparently where every cab driver comes for their steak and eggs, $5.99.  The food was nothing to write home about, very standard.  Clientele was ALL cab drivers, divided into various ethnic groups, telling outrageous cab stories.  I did feel a little awkward, my friend and I being the only girls in there for awhile, and being stared down by the cab drivers.  The waitress was attentive, and she knew the cabbies like regulars.  We easily scored a cab home (this comment will make sense in a bit).  I would have rather gone to the Peppermill.

The next night we came back to sample the pizza (since my dad said it was good years ago) and check out the karaoke bar.  Metro Pizza is 2 for 1 large pizza's on Sundays. Good deal if you ask me.  There is however, no place to sit and eat your pizza.  You can sit in the adjacent booths only after 10pm, because they are really only for the BBQ place.  I thought the pizza was pretty good, but I would have rather had it delivered to my room.

The real irony came when we were unable to find a taxi after our pizza feast. Not a single one to be found. There were 20+ drivers there not 14hrs ago! We walked to the hotel next door, and they called a cab for us and some other folks.  One showed up about 25 minutes later, and he told us to walk to the 7-11, that there were 2 sitting there. Make sure you have a ride home, because this place is not on the regular taxi circuit.

To sum it up, I would not come back unless I had to, and I would have their pizza delivered to my lazy butt.",3,0,0

Honestly, I didn't know Vegas had locals of this type. Nor did I want that knowledge.

This felt like the place where the Snowman got in a fight with the bikers in the movie Smokey and the Bandit...and that movie was filmed in Atlanta in the year Star Wars was released!

Sure, they have food specials at the cafe and BBQ restaurants (just little rooms, not really restaurants), but I had no interest in being around this crowd any longer than it took me to drink one beer.

Speaking of that beer, it is only $2 and they brew many different varieties.

Unfortunately, it was awful. As my old deceased friend would have said, ""That tastes like my first divorce...very bitter.""

Next time I want cheap beer in a Vegas dive, I'll just stick to the $1 Michelob and Michelob Light bottles at Casino Royale. (Besides, the White Castle inside there opens soon!)

My first two experiences with you and your famous steak and eggs were amazing!

and now? NOWW??? Not only is your steak and eggs deal only before 2PM, but your service just completely went down the drain. 

I had three groups come in for steak and eggs. The first group, sat, got served and had a pleasant meal. The next group sat down before I did (BEFORE 2PM) and after an hour wait for all of us.

finally about 15 minutes later, just before 2, my group got seated and immediately ordered the steak and eggs. Our server Joann was amazingly helpful and got our order in. After about 20 or so minutes, our food gets here, so I decide to get up and check in on the rest of my party. Now mind you, this is already 45 minutes into the meal. The first group still hasn't gotten their food, but their waitress said it was just about to come out, so I didn't make a super big deal of it. When I got to my second group, I noticed very very angry faces. THEY STILL HAD NOT GOTTEN THEIR FOOD. AND THE WAITRESS WAS IGNORING THEM. I was appalled so much I almost didn't  believe it. That is, until I saw it happen. I decided to sit down with them for a little, lo and behold I watched as their server walked right by them, even when my friend had her hand up and was verbally asking for assistance. WHAT THE HELL!. I end up going back to my table more visibly upset and scarf down my food in anger. another 15 minutes goes by and I walk back to see my friend Steve talking to the manager. I join in on the conversation and hear that their food STILL hasn't come out yet. 

After I join in on the talk about dissatisfied service, the manager walks into the kitchen and a minute later the food comes out. Really! All it took was getting the manager involved? SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY.

Oh! It's not over yet! My friends dig in to their food, Sirloin Steak & Eggs, (not the special) he ordered it medium and it was completely and irrevocably well done, with a nice layer of charred ash on top. Yum right! They also got the ham steak and eggs, and uhh... well needless to say he needed a glass of water with every bite as it was DRY DRY DRY DRY!!!!

oh and after almost 1 hour 30 minutes of hold up and terrible service, the manager only comped one of the meals....

The best friends in Vegas can do no wrong in my eyes.  The best friends in Vegas LOVE Ellis Island and that makes me love it too.  We planned a short stay-cation on Friday and thought this was the perfect place for a dine in dinner.  I've been here before and knew what to expect...and was ready!

Ellis Island is a small casino on Koval and Flamingo.  It's a little outdated but busy with locals and tourists.  The casino is a little smokey and the carpet makes the place look dated.  The restaurant in the casino is no different.  Dark maroon booths, wooden tables and lots of printed carpets.  The one thing I can appreciate is the wait for a table.  There's always a wait.  Tells me that this place is worth checking out.  On this visit, our server was a little creepy.  He kept winking at us and stared us down, but in the end, hooked us up big time.  

For dinner, we got the steak dinner (which is not on the actual menu...it's on their secret menu!)  for $8.99.  It's usually $11.99 unless you have their players card.  Although the card is free, we didn't have one, but our server actually gave us the discount anyway.  That's how he hooked us up!  This meal comes with a thick cut of steak, mine cooked medium rare, choice of potato, I chose the baked potato, and garlic green beans.  This meal also comes with your choice of their in house brewed beers.  I chose the light beer, equivalent to a bud light.  The steak resembled a filet but only the look!  It was still delightful and a thick cut of meat.  Juicy and cooked just the way I like it.  The baked potato was just served with butter and sour cream.  Where's the chives?!?!  I loved the green beans.  Seems blanched with nice sized pieces of garlic.  Super good.  The beer was refreshing and perfect for the meal. 

The one thing I love about my best friends in Vegas is the fact that they are so humble about the places they frequent.  They've turned me onto this place and the rest is history.  In my opinion, it's almost a five star.  I just can't give it that, as the places I've given five stars to before is in a whole other league.

The bar tender Rory at our local Village Pub on Rainbow told us about the fact the E.I. owned and brewed the beers that were in fact on tap at Village Pub. Also told us about the great food specials. Which in fact were amazing almost like Vegas should be. Food portions were good side as well. Overall this was a amazing time.

Who would think mere 11.99 could get you a full New York steak and fried shrimps with salad and rice, in a casino around the strip? I read the Yelp reviews but was skeptical until I saw it myself. It was true!

It was a decent meat with a decent portion for the price. Not a cheap junk. I even took out leftover with a box!

One downside of this place is the long wait - it took 30 minutes to be seated. But now I know why.",1,1,1

Good bbq this inexpensive can't really exist but it does.  It exists in Vegas off the Strip.

I got the combo, which was half a slab of pork ribs, half a chicken, coleslaw, grilled bread, corn on the cob, and barbeque beans that were the best beans I have ever had.  Restauarants usually make them too sweet, too mushy, too runny, or too sour.  But there was the great balance of smokey and sweet that I have never had.

Our waiter gave us the player's club price ($9.99) even though we didn't formally show them a member's club card, which was nice of him.  About 2-3 dollars cheaper and it's supposedly free to join.",1,1,1

We came here on a Friday night, a group of 6, for some steak and eggs. I found this place on yelp and it had really high reviews so I had to come and try it for myself! We came here a little after 11pm, just in time when they start serving steak and eggs. We walked up to the restaurant and saw a lot of empty tables so we thought that it was a pretty slow night. However, when we went up to the host, she said rudely that the wait was about 30 minutes with another party of 6 ahead of us. We were all confused to why we have to wait so long because there was so many open tables. I thought maybe not enough servers? But still, 30 mins??

So we waited and our pager finally buzzed. I was so happy and excited! As I followed the same host to our table, I said ""the wait is actually not that bad!"" but she pretended that I didn't exist and ignored me -__-. So I ordered the $5.99 steak and eggs, medium well. We didn't wait too long until we got our food and the first bite of the steak was delicious! I was so excited to get to the center where its the most juiciest! However, they over cooked my steak to the point it was so dry and it was so hard to eat, like a well done x2 steak T_T. I couldn't even enjoy it nor finish it so I gave the rest to my boyfriend since he wanted it. The steak was so overcooked that the next morning my boyfriend woke up with his jaw sore from chewing the steak LOL!! I laughed so hard that morning hahaha. My friends ordered medium rare and it came out looking like medium. So yeah, my experience wasn't that great however the potatoes and the egg was good and our server was amazing! He was so nice and friendly to us unlike the host. I'm willing to give this place another try but make sure I order medium rare.",6,5,4

I had the full rack of baby back ribs ($14).  The ribs are alright!  The texture of the ribs are odd, I agree w\/ Kelvin C.'s review, it tastes like the ribs are boiled.  If you slab on BBQ sauce they taste pretty good.

I also had the half rack of chicken ($9).  The chicken was pretty good.  I thought the breast was pretty dry but nothing BBQ sauce won't fix.  The rest of the chicken was ok.  I'm usually not a chicken guy but this was solid.

Beer is super cheap at $2.  The beer is alright.  It tastes watered down.

I come to LV a few times a year and usually stay on the strip or downtown, but I also like to try off-strip hotels, because there are some gems worth considering. This isn't one of them.

Disappointment started at check-in. I reserved a room through Travelocity and received a confirmation,  but the registration desk had no record of it in the hotel system and they were OVERSOLD. Seriously?  A quick call to Travelocity, who started by apologizing for the inconvenience (thank you!), and proceed to contact the hotel management.  Travelocity discovers that the hotel failed to update their manual system with my reservation, however a room materializes after a 45 minute wait in the lobby and coercion from me and Travelocity.  I smell rate-baiting.

The room itself is mediocre, even for an off-strip hotel. Electric outlets are few, and two didn't work. On the positive side, the room was clean and the air conditioning kept the room cool in July.
