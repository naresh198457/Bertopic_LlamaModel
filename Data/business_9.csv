That actually was impressive since it was Friday night of a fight weekend. 

I ordered the hangover omelet. It is made with bacon, fries and mushrooms. I substituted ham for the mushrooms. I hate mushrooms. The food was rather bland. I quickly asked for hot sauce. Even Cholula could not save it. It was not bad. It just liked any significant flavor. The portion was significant and it comes with your choice of fries. I chose the waffle fries. They were OK. 

Our service was as good as can be expected for a group of this size. They were all friendly, and did their best to keep up.  This is the reason they are getting three stars instead of two.

They would not divide up the bill at all. Only one bill per table. That was a giant pain. It took forever to work through a bill for over 30 people. I hate all the excuses restaurants use to justify not dividing bills. You are in a service industry. Figure it out.",0,0,0

I was extremely disappointed they were out of the mint one though!  Guess I'll have to brave the long line again if I want to try it.

The drink itself was quite large, and came with two straws, making it a good treat to share.  They definitely do not skimp on the whipped cream either!  It was very good, with a prominent cookies and cream taste, but not a must-have, considering the eyebrow-raising price and incredibly long line.

Of course we had to order the frozen hot chocolate (I had it in NY but JT never tried it). It was refreshing for the 95-degree weather (esp since we hit the pool right after). The portion is ginormous, especially after the other generous-sized items.

Service was decent, but it was still quite early for people to be up in Vegas, though it was almost noon. We sat outside and with the shaded area and the open doors with A\/C blowing out, it wasn't too hot. There is a $1000 ice cream sundae on the menu that has gold flakes.

It's a whimsy place, I can definitely see the appeal. The interior is decorated with fun, artsy looking wallpaper. And of course there is the window display of the shirts, toys and signature frozen hot chocolate powder you can purchase to bring home with you.

As for the food, the portions are huge, as well as the desserts. We mistakenly ordered the frozen hot chocolate first. I say mistakenly because it's quite large and we got pretty full from that! I recommend ordering it as dessert after your food. The food was standard, it didn't blow my socks off but it was tasty and did the job. 

The servers are pretty friendly and came over often to check up on us even when it was busy. 

Overall, I would definitely come back for the desserts. Be warned, you can probably share a dessert between two or three people. They are that big.",2,0,1

The Bloody Marys were excellent but I only wish there drinks were as stiff as there prices.

If the drinks weren't good, I would never think twice about going back.

They were told to come an hour early so they could wait for seats...but we must've waited 20 mins max and we were promptly seated...in a room that was only 3\/4 full.  I guess the hostess just wanted to pretend this place was more hopping than it was!

We, unfortunately, came here after eating a really late brunch, for an early dinner since we had show tickets later on that evening, so none of us were really hungry.  The sizes are definetly generous here.  I tried the tomato soup, crab & artichoke dip, chicken fingers\/tenders, and the frozen hot chocolate.  Everything was pretty good, even on a full stomach.  I would definetly recommend the crab & artichoke dip again.  Its mostly just a crab dip, with one piece of artichoke as a garnish, but the crab pieces were pretty big.  It's smothered in this baked cream sauce and served with small slices of toast.  The tomato soup was not too bad, but just overly salty.  The chicken fingers were surprisingly good and juicy. and served with a trio of sauces (honey mustard, bbq, and ranch)

Others on the table included the ABC burger (Avocado, Brie & Carmelized Onions) and the BBQ blue cheese burger.  Neither of them were finished but I didn't hear any complaints or compliments.

Unfortunately, they had all the doors propped open so it was much warmer in there then we had hoped. Come on people, it's the desert, close the doors!

Food wise, I ordered the chicken dinner, and that was certainly acceptable. It was a decently large portion and I left full. The mac & cheese side that came with was a big disappointment. Two of my friends ordered omelettes that were packed with all sorts of things that were horrible for you, like French fries. Yes, the omelette was stuffed with French fries! Their meals were HUGE and apparently pretty tasty as well (not factoring in the heart attack here).

We didn't get any of the frozen deserts that this place is famous for. I think we consumed enough calories by that point.

Price wise, I think it should have been a little cheaper, especially considering the cheap strip options that abound in the area.

So all in all, we were pretty happy with Serendipity 3. I think if we were to come back, I would try one of the deserts. Otherwise, I'd probably pass on getting dinner here.",1,0,0

We ended up getting a peanut butter frozen hot chocolate. It was delicious! It came out pretty quick and was just enough for 2 people - any bigger would have been overkill.

I don't remember the name of the drink I ordered, but it was some sort of berry mojito. It was such a good mojito. I appreciated all the fresh fruits that were combined in there. The next time I'm in Vegas, I will be sure to try their famous frozen hot chocolate.

It was a chilly night so the inside was busy, but the outside was pretty open, so we decided to ask for outside seating (there were heaters to make it doable).  We were seated pretty quickly which was nice, but that was the only nice thing.  After being seated, a server never even came to our table to ask if we wanted drinks.  We sat there for 30 minutes waiting without even getting acknowledged by the two waiters working the area even when we tried to get their attention.  3 groups were seated after us and received service.  I could understand if it was busy and they didn't have enough staff to cover the outside, but from the looks of it, the 2 servers outside were just plain pissed off about something and it wasn't that busy.  30 minutes is an inexcusable amount of time to wait to even have a server take a drink order.

They serve brunch, lunch, and dinner. They have a variety of foods that range from spaghetti and meatballs to barbecued pork ribs. They are very popular for their over sized desserts. I have tried their classic sundaes and their very popular frrrozen hot chocolate. Yes, frozen and hot. I know...it's weird, but you just have to try it to understand it. It's a very interesting drink that tastes like cocoa in hot chocolate, but it's cold and consistent to a strawberry daiquiri. Very unique, indeed. The bartender who made our frozen hot chocolate was very friendly  which is always a plus. 

I think it's pretty convenient that they have a take out counter outside. The wait for getting a seat in the actual restaurant usually takes between 30 minutes to an hour, but there is plenty of seating in the surrounding areas to indulge in chocolatey goodness. With all the glitz and glamor of Vegas, this is a simple and fantastic dessert to have during your stay. i suggest coming early to beat the lunch rush.

I had the caprese salad which the only thing that was good about it was the tomatoes. They used beautiful red, yellow and green heirloom tomatoes. But I did not enjoy the glob of ""wet cheese"" they slabbed in the middle of the plate or the oily over-poured dressing. So... they have a good tomato supplier.

My friends decided to order the veggie burger to split since they were still hungry... I tasted the burger and it was pretty good itself.

Big dry white bun, lettuce tomato and avocado. Dry. For the price, you can do better.

The last time I was there they were only at 8 in counting, so hopefully one of these days I'll get to see these ""gold flakes"" on a large sundae in action.  Perhaps if they lowered the price maybe more people would buy it?

We came on a monday around noon. We were four people sitting outside while we waited for about 20-25 mins. Not bad..that's what we were told how long in the beginning. We were texted that our table was ready so went inside. We were taken in by the hostess all the way around the restaurant and back outside....just so she can seat us right behind the table we were sitting on while waiting! Thought that was kinda funny but whatever. Waiter came and took our orders....and so it began...

Food took about 30-40 mins to come out. I got the shrimp pesto pasta. It was kinda bland so I generously poured salt and pepper all over it. My 2 friends got the pizza (I forgot what kind) and my bf got the steak standwich. I didnt try the pizza but it seemed mediocre from my friends' reaction. The steak sandwich was pretty good except my bf ordered medium well but the steak was red. He still ate it bec he likes rare also. Before this, I forgot to mention the waiter forgot to give us napkins and utensils. My friend had to go up to him to get his attention so we can ask for some. We also asked for parmesan cheese and red pepper for the pizza and we never got them. After a while you just get tired of waiting for the server or asking for things you will never get. They (2 different servers) also refilled our glasses with the wrong drinks. They tell you what they were gonna pour but before you can even say no, they've already poured the wrong thing or they tell you the right drink, but the wrong drink comes out of the pitcher. I didnt know whether to laugh or get mad. We were just bewildered by this catastrophic lunch. Customer next to us who was there before us didnt get her order until we were already done eating! As soon as her food came out, she also stormed right out just to prove a point. The main server said the kitchen is backed up. I wanted to tell him that I've been to plenty of really busy restaurants but their service remains excellent. Here, everything just seemed to have all gone wrong!

It was around 4 PM and it was super busy. It took a while for our waitress to finally reach us to take our order. For an appetizer, we ordered the Grilled Globe Artichokes, which was a big mistake. The artichokes we were served were quite small, dry and burnt, and we could barely salvage anything from them. We only got a couple leaves from each piece (three in total) and for $15, it wasn't worth it. We asked if we could order something else. The waitress let us know that the artichoke is suppose to be like that, but will gladly give us something different. We ordered chicken quesadillas. They were very average. Almost microwave quality.

I ordered the Chicken Chop Chop salad, which is basically like a garbage salad (not literally) and I didn't care for it at all. The chicken quality wasn't good and the salad was overall very bland. It reminded me of a cafeteria salad. My friend ordered The Full Monty Chicken Sandwich and she didn't care for hers either. 

At this point we came to the conclusion that this place is probably better known for their sundaes and not their food, as just about every table was enjoying a big sundae. I'm a sucker for Red Velvet Cake, so when I spotted Red Velvet Sundae on the menu, I didn't have to do any other reading. The sundae was huge and contained loads of chocolate ice cream, a slice of red velvet cake and whipped cream and sprinkles. The cake was mediocre and frankly didn't have much flavor. The chocolate ice cream was super good and creamy - almost like a rich, chocolate frozen custard or gelato. The mix of red velvet doesn't go smoothly with chocolate ice cream (yes I know Red Velvet Cake is technically chocolate cake).. it's a bit overpowering to where you can't taste the cake. It'd probably be better with vanilla ice cream. It was good, but not good enough to OD on. 

Unfortunately not impressed and probably wouldn't recommend. Also, no restrooms in the restaurant. Thankfully, there is one nearby.",1,0,0

With ""Ooh La La"" by Ronnie Wood & Ronnie Lane playing in the back of my mind as I am writing this review, my experience at Serendipity 3 may have been different had I ordered their frozen hot chocolate that all the other reviewers seem to have enjoyed.

""I wish that I knew what I know now

We were just there for dessert, and I was definitely not ordering their Golden Opulence Sundae, which was available for $1,000!!  Yes, $1,000!!!  The Golden Opulence Sundae actually holds the Guiness World Record for ""most expensive dessert.""  O____O.  Yeah, so... No, we did not order that.  

We were recommended their ""Can't Say 'No' Sundae,"" which was $14.  It seemed like a good idea at the time compared to the 1k sundae.  The sundae cup was glued down to the plate with chocolate fudge.  It had two bananas, peanut butter chocolate cake, two scoops of coffee and vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream (which was 50% of the sundae) and a cherry on top. 

""I wish that I knew what I know now

During my trip to Vegas for an event, my friends and I came here after it was recommended by our friend who went to the one in the New York.  We decided to drop by for our friend's birthday during our second day in Vegas for dinner.

We were seated fairly quickly for our group of seven (only about a 5-10 minute wait).  The interior of the restaurant just screams pink and girly... not sure if that style would go well with some (but I liked it).  The menu was huge (in both food selection and the actual menu) and a little bit more expensive than I thought.

My other friend ordered the chicken and waffles. She said the fried coating was saturated in oil and the waffles were brittle and crunchy, like it had been left under a heat lamp for too long.

I ordered the balsamic strawberry waffles. The strawberries were supposed to be soaked in balsamic. They were just regular strawberries and all of the balsamic was poured in the center of the bottom waffle. The waffles were at least softer and tastier than my friend's waffles, but they weren't anything special - they were your typical run of the mill, mass-produced Belgian waffle.

My husband and I decided to share the frrozen hot chocolate, ($16) and our friend got the banana split.  The server told him that he should probably get the smaller size of the banana split, since the one he opted for was massive.  He was right! When he got the small size, it was still the biggest banana split ever.  Everything was incredibly delicious. 

The only reason I'm docking a star is because our friends wanted coffee, but were told they would need to go inside themselves and order coffee as he can't make it in that area.  So, they went inside and were told by the employee inside that the server should have actually gone in and ordered it for them. Hmm. Also, about halfway through our visit, there was suddenly an odd smell at the outside area.. The place is right on the strip so it could have been coming from there, but regardless..it was kind of gross, and I'm glad we were pretty much done by the time it appeared.",3,3,2

So talk about your oxymorons. How can something be both ""hot"" AND ""frozen"" at the same time? I wondered that when I was told I should order a Frozen Hot Chocolate here at Serendipity 3. And so after a big dinner outside the Strip, my dad and I decided to save dessert and satisfy my curiosity.

After managing to cut through hoards of tourists to even get here, we were immediately faced with yet another crowd, this time all in line just to get in. I didn't realize Serendipity was also a restaurant, and not surprisingly, being located right on the Strip, on a Friday night there were 10 parties ahead of us (which I found out through their handy website and text-notification system). What I didn't figure out right away was that there was also a to-go window, so that's where we went ahead and got our drinks.

My dad got the Strawberry, and I went ahead with my friend's recommendation. OMG; That's some rich chocolate.

I got what seemed to be about 16 ounces of chocolatey goodness. I loved every sip, but the flavor was so dense I had to take a break after each one. I can see how this drink can leave an impression on people, but I do believe there's a catch. After my dad tried a sip of mine, he made a good point. The Frozen Hot Chocolate was much like pure chocolate syrup. Maybe ice was blended in with the syrup, but that's what it essentially was. But as a chocoholic, why wouldn't I enjoy that?

Well, a quick and easy reason is the price. For two of those suckers, I think the bill came out to about $20. A more foodie rationale might also argue the signature drink's lack of subtlety. It's like feeding people who love ketchup an even denser ketchup, with nothing else to enjoy it with. What might be fun is if they gave you biscuit sticks to dip into it, or if they floated, layered, or marbled vanilla ice-cream with the already concentrated concoction. Something along those lines to break it up a little.

That's my take on the Frozen Hot Chocolate. As far as the Strawberry version goes, my dad thought it tasted like an overpriced McDonald's Strawberry Milkshake. I concur.",1,1,2

The server was very good, and pretty easy on the eyes too - bonus :p.

As for the food, I ordered a side salad and the Kobe beef sliders as a meal.  The side salad was very nice with a bunch of different vegetables, and it was very large, but unfortunately overdressed - which was too bad because it was otherwise pretty tasty.  I should've asked for dressing on the side.

I really enjoyed the sliders - there were 4 of them, and I only ate two since I was saving room for dessert.  I think for the average person, this is an adequate sized meal.  The burgers were cooked more on the medium rare side, which is what I like.  They were juicy and tasty.  The bacon and the aioli were great.

While the inside is cute in some ways and what you come to expect from a traditional ice cream parlor, it seriously lacks ambiance. It is just a little too bright, a little too sparse, not quite clean enough, way too busy, and too many screaming children.

The wait here can be insanely ridiculous at times. And the wait isn't really worth it. Come back when it's not so busy.

Personally, I prefer to dine outside. While service always seems to be slower outside, it is good people-watching and just a better experience overall.

The food is good. I've never had anything bad. I've also never had anything crave-worthy or exceptional.

One of the best things here is the wings. Definitely one of the better places in Vegas for hot wings. Very meaty and good quality wings. Lots of sauce with just the right thickness and spice (sauce has a hint of cinnamon too). Excellent blue cheese sauce for dipping.

The hot dog, mac 'n' cheese, etc. are all good. Again, never had anything bad. But none of it really stands out either. And while one could justify the prices because the portions are huge, it still just all seems way over-priced.

They have a great list of sundaes and other desserts. And all have been good. But there's nothing great about any of them. The ice cream isn't anything great, their hot fudge sauce isn't anything different from anywhere else, etc.

Skip the cocktails. While they mostly all sound good, none of them are actually good.

My three friends and I shared two of the famous frozen hot chocolates just to see what the hype was about. There are several choices including oreo, amaretto, double chocolate, etc. We ended up getting the green tea and mint chocolate. Each Starbucks grande-sized cup was $11. I repeat. $11. Let that sink in as I move on....

When we got our frozen hot chocolates, the cups were about 3\/4-full and swirled with an unnecessarily large mountain of whipped cream and some tacky rainbow sprinkles. The green tea frozen hot chocolate was pathetic and bland as hell. A green tea frappuccino is better tasting and 1\/3 of the price. We were in better luck with the mint chocolate. It actually tastes good; however, Serendipity still has no business selling this minuscule drink for $11.

If you want to delve into the enigma that is the ""frozen hot chocolate"", just go to Starbucks and order a frappuccino. If you're still curious and have to try one, get the mint chocolate so that you aren't completely disappointed! 

Note: I totally didn't mean to sound like a Starbucks salesperson, but in my opinion the frozen hot chocolate is just a glorified frapp!",3,2,1

The drink was crunchy from the granulated sugar crystals that didn't dissolve at all, so I probably took 5 sips of it to verify I wasn't insane before abandoning it. It was terrible and disappointing.

I don't know if this place once was famous for product quality, but every dish I walked by looked quite unremarkable at best. Pizzas were limp and salads were massive plates of pale iceberg.

No, really... about 10 pages of Yelp reviews which are only one or two lines mention just this one treat. How could our hero pass it up? Let's cut to the chase...

It's $11.

- Fairly good selection of frozen treats.
- Kitschy interior that's nice for kids. They also have a sprawling mist-cooled outdoor patio too.

- Let's be real, the frozen hot chocolate is basically a chocolate slushie with whipped cream. And it's way to expensive for what you get. Tip a stripper in Vegas instead.",5,6,5

We were given a buzzer when we asked for a table for two, which was fine, it was a saturday night and we figured it was pretty packed. Waited around for about 10 minutes then got buzzed and seated. The place was totally NOT packed. There were probably 5 open tables and no one being seated. A few of the tables still had a bunch of trash on and i didn't see anyone going to clean it. 

Once we were seated we took a look at the menu. We decided to just stick with water for our drinks since we were getting a sundae. We opted for the Jackpot Sundae at 14 bucks because it was a combo of chocolate (which my boyfriend likes) and strawberry (which I like). 

Waited waited waited. It literally took them 15 to 20 minutes to come to us and they never even took our drink orders yet. We were seriously on the verge of leaving. There was a table of 3 next to us that came in 10 minutes after we did and we could tell they were waiting too. We decided that if they took their orders first, we were just going to up and leave.Tthey didn't, so they got us to stay for a while longer, but they did take their order RIGHT AFTER ours. 

We were never asked if we needed anything or how we were doing, the waitress never even refilled our waters. 

We waited about 20 more minutes for the sundae. It was freakin' ridiculous! I have a feeling they must be like this all the time. We noticed 4 cups of french fries in the kitchen that was just sitting there for 10 minutes, I hope they don't just give that to people when it gets ordered. 

The sundae finally came. Half melted. Of course, they brought out everyone else's order at the same time. Are they really that lazy? They just had to wait to finish everyone's order from different tables to bring it out at the same time instead of making a few trips? The sundae's were seriously dripping because they must've been sitting and melting for a while. 

The only thing they managed to bring in a very speedy manner was the check, of course. She pretty much gave that to us right after she handed over the sundae. So annoying. I should've ordered a soda or something just so she'd have to take it back and change it. 

The sundae was good, but it definitely doesn't make up for the horrendous service. It sucks that they have such an awesome location and awesome theme, but the service just ruins it all. They should really be more selective with their staff, I honestly don't know what they were thinking.

I would give it 5 stars but the price for food here is RIDIC!
Love the ambience, we sat outside but it was quite cold. A table inside can be a long wait 45min-1hr on a good day. And it does get freeezing in vegas. Our seats we're right next to the Caesars fountain [aka splash zone] so I was freezing. Plus the heater wasn't working :[

We ordered the ABC burger [$16.50] with Sweet Potato Fries and frozen hot chocolate and split the meal which was perfect! Cause the burger was huge! I wouldn't have been able to finish it. We also had a coupon for buy one entree and receive a free frozen hot chocolate. Score! So we were forced to order food.

ABC Burger was really good actually, but NOT $16.50 good. The avocado really made the burger plus it was really juicy and cooked just right. Sweet potato fries were pretty delish too, they don't give you any special sauce except for ketchup which was lame. But stick to the dessert, you wont regret it! We came back here the next day and ordered the Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate which was good too but we like the original hot chocolate better.

Stick to the hype. LOL!",1,0,0

It was January 1st and we needed a hangover cure. We were told that the wait was 45 minutes, but since it was freezing and we noticed everyone's great-looking food, we stayed. Other than the hostesses barking at people to get out of the doorway (there was a huge crowd, no waiting area, and nowhere for people to really stand), the wait didn't take long at all, and we were seated after about 20 minutes. 

The cute decor made you feel like you were in a pretty, trendy NYC cafe. I've never visited the NYC location, but Las Vegas' all-out glamorous decor seemed like a good answer to it. Feeling particularly like lard asses, we ordered the mac and cheese, chili cheese dog, and one of the sandwiches with turkey, brie, and apple slices. And 2 frozen hot chocolates to share, of course. Our waiter was cool, upbeat, and even switched tables for us when he heard us joking that it wasn't level. 

I've met very few mac and cheeses I didn't like, but this one was off the charts. It came in a deep dish with a rich sauce and prosciutto chunks. So perfect for a cold, hungover day. My friend's chili cheese dog was ridiculously long and she only got about halfway through, and our other friends' open-faced sandwich was great as well. The hot chocolate was decadently delicious, but not $10 so.

I liked this place for the huge menu of both healthy and comfort food, the cocktail list, great waitstaff and cute decor. I disliked the hostesses who thought they were the ish for working at such a ""cool"" place, the expensive prices, and the way that the bathrooms were outside the restaurant. Our food was great, but the prices still seemed overinflated and as if we were paying for the image and novelty. Glad I got to try it, though!",3,1,1

I called and had to leave a voicemail but never received a return phone call so we went to the restaurant and the wait was an hour for 15 people.  Since we were in a hurry, decided to order our food to go and sit on the outside tables to eat.  The hostess said they do not take to go orders.  Then we decided to order food from the outside part of Serendipity, it's called something like ""quick bite and run"".  We had 15 girls with us, it was a challenge in itself to get everyone's order and have one person go up to the window to order.  Came up to the window and started reading off our order.  The employee said ""we only serve pastries and drinks until noon"".  No where on the signs or menu did it indicate serving times.  She recommended we order to go from the restaurant since they have a more extensive menu.  I told her we asked the hostess and were told to go is not offered.

He said it was ""amazing"" when he came several years ago. I guess all that's gone downhill now, because he was one of the most disappointed guests at our table.

Food--
The food at our table, as described by myself and my friends, ranged all the way from ""Mmmmm!"" to ""I regret wasting an hour of my life waiting for this."" The people at our table who ordered the strawberry cream waffles, fried eggs benedict, and breakfast quesadilla seemed happy with their meal.
Two of us (including myself) ordered The Hangover Omelet. On both dishes, the potatoes were BURNED to a CRISP. AND they weren't even hot!!! I'm talking dry, black, LUKEWARM potatoes. Simply not edible however I tried. The French fries, which were put into the omelet itself, were soggy and rubbery enough to confirm that the dish had been sitting out for a while before being brought to our table.
My fiancé ordered a side of black beans with his dish. The beans came out late, after he asked where they were. And they came out COLD. We notified the server, who then MICROWAVED them. Are you kidding me? We ALWAYS try our best to be good and friendly customers when we go out, but this was beyond disappointing.
The only part of the meal that I actually enjoyed was the Café Serendip. It wasn't bad. I'm starting to think the only thing anyone should order from this place is dessert.

Service--
After waiting about 30 minutes to be seated, we had to wait another 15 or so for the attention of a server. After our order was taken, it took yet another 30-45 minutes until we asked where our food was. Our waitress was not friendly and spoke very quietly (which is not good in a relatively loud environment). I can only guess that she was having a bad day.
The kicker came when we got the check and saw that the cold beans, which were then microwaved, cost $7. $7 for a little itty bitty 8oz cup of beans that weren't even made properly. In most establishments, staff will at LEAST tell you how much a side dish of something will cost when you order it. On the bright side -- the only reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is that the waitress did offer to take the beans off the check, which we gratefully accepted.

The nutmeg was unfortunately too overbearing. But, I still enjoyed the first half of the cup while it was warm....the cup was massive.
The empire state onion rings were amazing!!!!! I highly recommend getting them.

I would skip out on dining in. There are so many more places to eat at in Vegas! I've had their Pesto Pizza and it was just mediocre. You'll pretty much be paying about $15-$16 for an extra flat piece of bread with bland toppings.

3 stars for the Frozen Hot Chocolate and Deep Fried Oreo Sundae or any of their ice cream for that matter. This place is excellent for getting your ice cream fix. The corn flake batter on the oreos was a nice touch! All of the sundaes are perfect for sharing because everything is super sweet and seems physically impossible to finish alone.

If you are coming for dessert, it's probably best to order outside because the lines are much shorter and faster. The con with this is that during the winter, it is extremely cold outside and you are forced to eat your ice cream under the heated tables, which makes it melt faster. We were also told that in order to sit indoors, we had to dine-in and order something more than dessert. Since the space is pretty small, I can understand why this would be a rule, but it's also more of an inconvenience.",0,0,0

Frozen Hot Chocolate, their signature thingie majiggy that was in the movie... It basically tastes like powdered hot chocolate, like the ones I used to have as a kid, frozen... Then tossed into a blender when it's being served. My GF and I shared the regular sized one for $10... It was pretty rich but the massive amount of whipped cream assisted to tone it down.

Other than this signature beverage, I wasn't really WOW'd by it. I guess it's just one of those things that you just have to try and see for yourself whether or not you're going to like it since there's so much hype over it.

KOBE SLIDERS-- $12 for about.. (make a C with your fingers) that big, which were DRY.  Very overpriced for crap quality.  Bacon Aioli was good but that was it.

SWEET POTATO FRIES-- $4 Why did people hype this up so hard? They're not crispy, the quantity is that of a kid's meal fries.  These were so whatever

CRAB ARTICHOKE DIP $13-- This was ok.. has big chunks of crab swimming in a sea of CREAM.  Should have just called it, ""Cream of Crab"".  I'm not super lactose but this stuff made my stomach ache! It's a little plain in taste and I was def missing that ""OOMPH"". It never came

Hot as balls that day, of course we had to come here. My boyfriend raved about this place and so I had to see it for myself. Strikingly trendy, the decor was cutesy and retro. Cute marble tables, colorful stripes on the walls, the color pink incorporated into nearly everything, and comical poster sized menus.

My boyfriend and I waited in line for about 10 minutes, then we were told that a table would be about 30 minutes. I said okay and the hostess told us that I'd get a text when our table was ready. 20 something odd minutes later, I received a text and we bolted for the door to Serendipity.

We got our seats and we ordered. Just a late lunch snack consisting of a chicken quesadilla and a frozen hot chocolate for two. The quesadilla was just okay, I've had better at Chevy's. The frozen hot chocolate, however, was delicious. I want to make something clear, though, just so there is no confusion. The infamous frozen hot chocolate from Serendipity is not a hot\/cold sundae (which is what I thought it was), but it is the hot chocolate that we all love and know so much in an icy, cold form. Perhaps they should rename it to a hot chocolate slushy?

I came in on a Monday morning which meant that it was fairly slow. We had to walk around asking the waiters if we sit anywhere or if there was someone to seat us, in which they just pointed to one direction and told me to speak with the hostess. Not a big deal. After we spoke to the hostess, she was able to seat us down promptly and gave us menus. The waitress came by with waters for us and told us she'd be back shortly to take our order. 15 minutes later, she came to take our drink order. A friend of mine ordered a coke and the rest of us was content with our water. She came back with the coke and left sooner than we could ask to put our order in. So we sat there patiently and waited for her. 15 minutes later, we see her walking around and talking to customers and still have not come back to simply take our order. At this point, we ran out of patience and decided to leave. Right when we were about to leave, she came back and asked if we were ready. I told her that we decided to leave instead and she had the nerve to charge my friend for her UNTOUCHED coke. We were so furious that we just gave her the EXACT cash and left. Didn't take her name or collect the reciept which I wish I would have so I could include it this review.

I am very big on service, but I am understanding in certain scenarios. But 30 mins of waiting on a slow day to simply take our order is definitely unacceptable. I don't even care to try their food anymore. It seemed overpriced and nothing special. Instead, I walked across the street to The Quad and had Hash House instead; for half the price, the service was top knotch and it was extremely busy there.

So the verdict? simply meh. It did kinda taste like a chocolate milkshake but with a more chocolaty rich flavor. Was it worth the 10.00? Absolutely not. I only got through about a quarter of it before I got tired of it, said F this and threw it away. 
So a few weeks later, I was talking to a friend who asked about my recent trip to Vegas. Told her I tried the frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity. She got all excited and told me she had tried it too but at Dunkin Doughnuts. We both agreed that it was good but really rich. Then I said ""I didn't feel it was worth the 10.00. I think she felt bad telling me that she had only paid... get this... 2.00 for hers! Trying to make me feel better, she insisted that mine was probably better to which I replied ""Nope, I am pretty sure they were the same."" Haha, so there you have it, even though I have not tried the one from Dunkin Doughnuts, I would say to try theirs if you really feel you must try ""frozen hot chocolate"" aka ""The more chocolaty milkshake."" No milkshake is ever worth 10.00!!! I just wish, I had come to this conclusion before basically giving my money away. Well ya live ya learn   :)

Note to self: When at Dunkin Doughnuts, try the Frozen Hot Chocolate to determine if it is not as good as, as good as, or better then Serendipities version. Then post the review on Yelp so others will not have the misfortune of spending too much if Dunkins is as good as or better. 
Keep an eye on my profile if you are interested in the results. I have a feeling this study will be conducted within the next few weeks as I have been jonsing for a chocolaty fix lately   :O",0,0,0

You people need to work on your review game.  So do I, mine sucks.

I did not sit down inside Serendipity 3 (stupid name), nor did I order food here.  So that means I can't complain about poor service or bad food.  Instead I get to complain about the dessert.

We ordered a Fffffffamous Ffffrrrrroooozzzeeeen Hot Chocolate to share and it was fffffreeakin' expensive (RIP Mitch).  $10 for that?  And $1 for a cup of tap water.  Thank you, shall I just leave my wallet here?  Ok.

But was it good?  Yes, but it was also pretty much on par with an ice-blended drink from Coffee Bean.  So many times we have asked people to describe a Frozen Hot Chocolate and it's always like ""You have to try it to find out"" no, shut up, it's like an ice-blended chocolate shake, stop being all mysterious this isn't a club.

This is another legacy that is underserving, and the current average review is starting to show that.  ""You just have to go here when you're in Vegas"".  I don't think so.  Also frozen hot chocolate is an oxymoron and you can't convince me that it makes sense.  We cannot have Boiling Ice Cream...because that's just cream, isn't it?

Also, just a note to Serendipty 3, but your outside window menu lists one of the items as being more expensive for Total Rewards members.  If no one has told you yet it's because we think it is funny and believe you should keep it up there.",4,3,2

Mac & Cheese- Just like any other mac & cheese from any other place such as Hard Rock Cafe. It wasn't too cheesy which was good and it had a hint of truffle on it. I wish it had a bit more truffle. On the other hand the bacon was a bit too oily and fatty for my liking.

Dont Be Afraid Of My Alfredo-  Be very afraid if you can't eat a lot. This pasta dish is very filling and cheesy. It wasn't the worse Alfredo I had, but definitely far from the best. To put this in perspective, I believe Cheesecake Factory's Alfredo is superior.

The Chili Cheese Dog- The chili cheese dog was a foot long... Too bad it tasted like any other chili cheese dog and not to mention 18 bucks 

Crab Cake Sandwich- Probably the only thing that stood out. My friend had this, and said it was delicious but yet not worth the money.

We also had their frozen hot chocolates. I don't why they are famous for it, but it just tasted like any other shake.. If you do get the frozen hot chocolate I recommend the original or the strawberry one. DO not get the Oreo one as it was way too sweet.

The reason I give it 3 stars (and im assuming this is also why the place only is rated at 3 stars) is that they are so super freakin SLOWWWW! We had to wait an hour for brunch.

Don't worry about getting the Frozen Hot Chocolate; it just tastes like a cheap milkshake--but if you have to get it at least once, I understand... I won't tell you what to do with your $10-$12

1st experience I would give Serendipity 3 a modest two star.  Service was not up to par with the majority of the strip but the atmospher, especially if you sit outside makes it better.  I Got the Challah French toast which would be good if you have never had French toast made with delicious Jewish holiday egg bread but was mediocre for what it is.  I probably could make one better(and it would be stuffed with cookie butter from Trader Joe's :D ) 

I was craving lunch as well so I ordered the summer brie's which is a pumpernickel raisin bread sandwich with turkey, alfalfa sprouts, sliced apples and the overall decision maker for me, melted brie.  The sandwich  was good, but not great and I always have high hopes for a sandwich that has such promise and all the neccessary components of a perfectly balanced sandwich.  

During my 2nd visit, I had a much better experience.  My friend Dindi told me how amazing the frozen hot chocolate was and I did not hesitate to find out for myself.
I was unaware of how EPIC Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate is.  Got two different flavors: a white chocolate frooooozen and a Peanut Butter frooooozen.  

All I could think was HOLY COW......I am going to convert to Hinduism.  

Tastes just like hot chocolate, the other flavors in the drink only make it better, and I will DEFINITELY stop at the walk up counter outside when I am entering or leaving Ceasar's Palace.  

As for the food this time around...much better all around.  

I got the crab cake sandwich and not anything about this sandwich was on point.  The crab cake tasted fresh, was not fishy, had a perfect amount of sauce and toppings and was definitely not skimpy with the crab cakes.  

My favorite dish that I have had thus far from Serendipity was their steak sandwich.  Came on footlong Italian bread, mayo, lettuce, tomato, basically two separate cuts of steak and three sunny side up eggs.  MUAH!
Washed this monster of a sandwich down with a root beer, Death Valley Root Beer to be exact, which is even tastier, creamier, and richer since they have it on draught.

You would expect a restaurant of this popularity to have some quality control.  But no, my friend ordered sweet potato fries and they were hard as rocks.  luckily, our waiter was understanding and sent her a new order right away without question.  A Las Vegas native advised me to skip the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate and get a different dessert, but I stubbornly said that the hot chocolate was what I had come here to try, and I might as well since I can't come here a lot.

A wonderful treat on a hot Vegas day.  Definitely worth a try.  $11 worth...?  Dunno.  I'm glad i tried it, don't know if I'd go back for another one honestly, but it's worth trying.",2,0,0

My friends and I were going to eat here for lunch, but  the wait time was over an hour and half. I didn't understand, there was SO many tables open. Maybe short of staff? Honestly, I wouldn't mind waiting if I wasn't starving. 

Luckily they had a To-Go order window outside, you can only order SOME of their stuff. Since I was going to eat Bacchanals later, I just needed something to  fill up my tummy. I got the Frozen Hot Chocolate, which was the number 1 item everyone recommended. VERY disappointed. First, I assume it was was going to come out like it did for the dine in pictures, NOPE. It came out in a To-Go cup. Which I understand, since it was To-Go, but STILL, I wanted that picture. Secondly, it just tasted like chocolate, like the regular chocolate shake you can get from IN-N-OUT.  Didn't taste like no hot chocolate flavor I was expecting. Maybe it was because I got it To-Go instead of dining in? MAYBE.

Overall, I might come again. This time, to dine in and not To-Go.",3,1,1

Now, the Frozen Hot Chocolate comes in two sizes. For one and for sharing. We decided on the basic Frozen Hot Chocolate for one. The size of this drink was hugeeeeeee. I don't think I can ever drink the whole thing by myself and if I ever did, please slap me in the face.

The polenta was over cooked and dry. The bacon tasted like the way your dog's bacon treat smells. The poached eggs were probably the only thing done right. I also got the Tiffany expresso. It was literally a shot of expresso top with a small dollop of whipped cream and exactly (yes, I counted) seven jimmies. That's it. For 6 dollars.

There wasn't anything that was gonna get us to order something or even taste what people are ordering so I have nothing much to say on food and will just quote what people said at the table. 

My one brother who's definitely a foodie wasn't happy with his frozen chocolate what he said was ""a melted milkshake"" and he would have been better off ""with a In N Out milkshake"". Then I found out he wanted to come with me instead to Max Brenner. *sigh* (And we did go the next day while family shopped). Another brother got coffee and it was nothing special. The kids liked their desserts, but they're KIDS. I can put sugar on roaches and they'd think it's a crunchy goodtime. My sister had a sundae and it was fairly standard. My cousin had a cake that was super in size and had a lot of leftovers but he said it was good. 

Service wasn't rude this time, but it wasn't really hitting service standards. It was more like- take the order, bring it, and if you need the check go find them. Desserts took about 35 minutes to come. One person came late and ordered after everyone else. They got a slice of cake and that didn't come around until way later when most people had their desserts done....Cake doesn't even need to be prepared so it shouldnt take 50 minutes to receive it! Just put it on a fucking plate and add whip cream and a strawberry.

Well, just confirms to me- I wasn't just ""hating"" in my first review, this place isn't that great with service nor expediting orders.  Dessert shouldn't take almost 2 hours specially since we're one of the last reservations of the night. 

Stop buying into brand names. Serendipity lost the charm that made it sucessful in the first location decades ago. Serendipity doesn't live to its name and is just bad misfortune with each visit.

Was finally seated by a friendly waitress after about a half hour wait.  The food was okayy...kind of disappointed because this place was so hyped up and sounded like a ""must-try"" in Vegas.  

Had a chance to try the Kobe Beef Sliders, Hot Dog, Clam Chowder soup, Frozen Hot Chocolate (which is the supposedly the ""best"" thing everrrr -.- ) BBQ Chicken pizza, Hangover (omlette) and sweet potato fries.  The food tasted like it should.  Nothing special besides the fact that the prices were doubled than what they should cost and the portions were messed around with.  The sliders were really cute and small but not worth the 9 because the ""kobe"" patties they used tasted like any other patty.  The guacamole for the hot dog was good but the hot dog was just a hot dog except it was longer.  Basically, everything was just average. Dont get worked up on the hypeeee!!!

Overall, I'd say come here for the atmosphere.  The ambience is nice, the design of the restaurant is cute and I wanna say..girly...The service is friendly. The frozen hot chocolate is appealing to the eyes but it just tastes like a little melted down chocolate shake. Everything else was pretty mediocre. Probably won't come back unless its hot out and my friends want to share an expensive chocolate shake. Another disappointing thing was that the clam chowder and sweet potato fries came out lukewarm, not hot at all.  Don't know if it was because it was a cold day or what, just a bit bummed the chowder was cold, but its not bad.

I think the reason why they have such GINORMOUS menus is so they can occupy your attention  while they take they sweet time getting your order out.  

Desserts are fab but not really worth the wait.  Even if you order from their take out side (which we attempted the next weekend).  A banana split took 20 minutes!!).  They definitely need to work on their service.  And if they want to uphold the essence of the NYC Serendipity, they might want to steer away from playing hip-hop music.

Okay so I've only heard about this place and the ""frozen hot chocolate"" so many times... so I thought for a really long time that this place was like a bakery or cafe that served drinks and dessert.

So when I finally came with a few coworkers and saw the menu of burgers and hot dogs, I was slightly disappointed. Other disappointments:

- Insane wait. 45 minutes for a table of 5
- Frozen hot chocolate. It was good, but not $15 good
- The food. Though tasty, so greasy and made me feel sick for the rest of the night
- The presentation of the food. I think they're trying to come off as boutique, but it's just inconvenient and inefficient to eat your food from one large dish when you have six other small dishes of individual condiments around you. It's fine if you're by yourself, but when you're at a table with 4 other people and they also have 4 other dishes besides their main dish, you fight for elbow space
- The scary baby. This isn't S3's fault, but there was a baby who was staring straight at us with no expression. It was freaky, man

I mean, come on now. $15 for a foot-long hot dog? I don't care how awesome that hot dog was (it wasn't that great) or that we're in Las Vegas or if you serve it on a foot-long dish that holds it perfectly. No hot dog is worth more than a $1 per inch. It's a hot dog, aka, blended leftover parts from animals. I'd rather buy two hot dogs from Costco AND get two drinks!",2,3,1

From the time we put our names on a list to be seated, to the time we ordered our food...it took about 1 1\/2 hours. We were seated in about 30 minutes, so it took our food about 1 hour to get to the table. 

Everything is super expensive! We ordered off the appetizer menu and one dessert. All in all, our food + water, the bill came out to about $70.00 (tip not included).

We had the crab\/artichoke dip (just okay, nothing special), then we ordered chicken strips (gross! over breaded, tiny chicken on the inside, they left the chewy tendons in the chicken too), we also had the kobe beef sliders (BURNED! BURNED! BURNED! - i don't mean a nice flavorful char on the outside, i'm talkin CHAR-COAL!). 

Lastly, on to the dessert, Red Velvet sundae (basically a red velvet cake with chocolate ice cream). Let's just say, the cake was dry, the chocolate ice cream was nothing special, and the heap of whipped cream hurt my teeth. The texture was so mushy and squishy. They should have added some nuts, or chocolate chips or something.

I'm from Connecticut visiting vegas for a few days and on the first morning we stopped in to try it out.  Thank god we found this place! Now being in Vegas obv every restaurant is going to be pricey and this one was a bit pricey for what I'm used to.  But guaranteed, you will get your money's worth.
We ordered the croissant egg breakfast sandwich and the corner beef and eggs.  Our food came in about 15-20 min so that was good.  My sandwich was perfect, the croissant was a good size and stuffed with gooey cheese eggs and bacon.  After 1 bite I was in love.  The corned beef was some of the best I've had.  Was not greasy at all and great flavor to it. 
We were in Vegas for 3 days and went there 3 times to eat.  On the last night we ate there I ordered a huge steak bacon and eggs sandwich on a full sized French baguette.  It was fucking incredible.  The steak had great flavor and everything just tasted so good and handcrafted.  This place was worth every penny and next time I'm in Vegas I'll definitely go there again.",1,1,1

This is why I am soooo disappointed and freaked out by my last experience. 

My friends and I made Serendipity our last stop before leaving Vegas. I ordered the Hangover Omelette. I really enjoyed it so I took home the left overs. The next morning, while chewing on a bite, I heard hard loud crunch. I though it was an egg shell at first, but when I felt around and spit it out, I found it was A PIECE OF GLASS ALMOST A CM LONG AND HALF A CM WIDE!!!!

This was literally right now and I was in Vegas yesterday. 

One side is rounded, smooth and shiny, while the other side is jagged and matte. I think its a chip from a plate or something. I am now freaking out wondering if I have already ingested any other pieces.

I remember this experience quite vividly because it was one of my more memorable nights in Vegas.

That same year, I discovered the original Serendipity 3 in NYC and sure, I wasn't head-over-heels crazy about it, but like any other trip, I always try compare and contrast and search for exclusive items. Sadly, there was nothing different--at least on the more affordable side--that reflected Las Vegas' charm.
So, it actually took me two tries to finally get something from this location, and it didn't end up as ideal. The first time, they were closing at around 11--I mean, who closes at 11 PM in Vegas?! 

I finally got to try this place on New Year's Eve, moments away from their closing, through their take-out station outside. I had a Strawberry Supreme and fries and both were mediocre; the fries were soggy and were almost inedible. I was looking forward to the drink because, let's face it: if you paid $10 for a cup, you better have very high expectations. It was bad. Real bad. It was overly sweet, flavored (it tasted like cheap juice) and blended with milk and cream. The whipped cream did not help, but I give them some props for at least some effort for festivity with the rainbow sprinkles. I'm reading and seeing that it shoud have been a velvety red color--mine looked like a strawberry milkshake, meaning cream was added to it. Still, I felt as if it was rushed since it was one of the very few ""cheaper"" and quick food options on the bustling Strip that night and businesses skyrocketed. It didn't help at all that I was eating and drinking this in 30-degree weather in their outdoor seating. I have only gone back Serendipity 3 once since and I'm not a much of a fan with the drinks.

Wow, I can't believe I pulled this from the back of my head like nothing!",5,3,2

The service was terrible; it took almost an hour for our drinks to be delivered and almost forty-five more minutes for our frozen hot chocolate to arrive. The real kicker was that it wasn't even crowded- there were at least thirty tables open and all of the waitstaff were just standing around talking. As for the frozen hot chocolate, we deemed it sub-par and overpriced. You can get frozen hot chocolate from Dunkin' Donuts that is just as good as or better than Serendipity's for a much more affordable price. Sure, I understand that you're also paying for the atmosphere, but based upon the service and the quality of the food, I don't think my family will be returning to Serendipity 3 any time soon.

I had the hangover omelet and was full from only a quarter of the portion.  truly a mix of goodness: fries, cheese, mushrooms, and bacon wrapped in an egg.  genius.  

the  menu had clever names and a wide variety, so it takes about 10  minutes to read what exactly is in everything.  it's probably good to get an idea before you go.. from what i've read before we went, sometimes service is slow [which i'm assuming is based on how busy it is..] luckily we went on a not so busy day. 

husband had the ahi which was also excellent.  the serving of tuna filled him up, and the plate was majority rice pilaf mixed with sweet onions.  sweet potato fries are also a must try... which is served with most plates.

so getting to the point.. I had a black and white sundae.  half chocolate half vanilla.. whipped cream with white chocolate shavings.. chocolate syrup, and a strawberry tuxedo.. [chocolate made to look like a tux] covered strawberry.. best part.  otherwise, it's a big ass bowl of ice cream.  big deal.  

BUT I also had a bite of the deep fried oreos which was pleasantly not so much oreo-e then I thought. I don't know everything in that.. but the Oreo was dope.

reason why this place was only 3 stars? it did not add up to the hype. First the movie, then everyone going bat shit crazy about their frozen hot chocolate. then reviews on this place in magazines, tv, friends, OPRAH. I HAD to try it. 

the prices are ridiculous. I know the portions are ginormous but, wow.. seems like you're paying more for the atmosphere than the food. 

I wasn't that hungry and did not feel like paying $15 for a hamburger, so I wanted to try the frozen hot chocolate and their sweet potato fries.

FRIES WERE GOOOOOD you can't go wrong with sweet potato fries.. you just cant. as for their frozen hot chocolate. i have to ask, WHAT IS THE FREAKING BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS? its like a chocolate slush. not creamy or thick like a milk shake but lighter almost like frozen chocolate milk. 

sigh* i expected so much more. i expected something that was like the name. that they invented something that was a cold frothy and icy on the outside  and when you drank it , it would be warm or something on the inside. well that's what i imagined. nonetheless i was disappointed.

The Las Vegas strip sandwich had good potential and a sure protein booster. However, it was so dry I felt like dipping it in the frozen hot chocolate so I could swallow it.

I absolutely loved the frozen hot chocolate. There were many flavors to choose from, but I decided the OG original because I felt I would not be steered wrong.  The taste of the drink is something I could not really describe. It definitely is not like a frosty or a milk shake, but something in between. It was topped with whip cream and served with two straws for my Mom and I to share.

The only reason I could not give five stars to this Serendipity is the fact that it took us 45 minutes to get our drink. The wait was so long and there was relatively a short line. There was only one man working the register and one man making the dishes.  The wait inside was one hour at 11:00 PM.

Ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Lobster Artichoke Dip and Carrot Cake Sundae. 

Out of all of these my favorite was the dip. It was creamy and stayed consistently hot for a long duration of time as we ate it. The dip didn't ball up or string up. Hard to keep my hands off of the bite sized bread slices that came with the dip because they were delicious!

The pizza on the other hand was a lot spicier than we had expected. Tons of cheese and I found myself scraping off some of the cheese. The blu cheese crumble added some flavor to the otherwise large mass of mozzarella. 

Ended with the sundae and was satisfied. I had thought they would mix in the carrot cake with the ice cream but it was simply a smack dab piece of carrot cake balanced on top of the sundae. It tasted good but I felt as if I could make it at home. 

Overall our service was good, but one thing I was surprised about was how the interior of the restaurant seemed ""cafeteria-ish"". Painted concrete floor. Very echo-ey so it was hard to hear when conversing.

The menu is overly priced without a doubt. Hey, you're in Vegas. Go big or go home. I like to live with that mantra when it comes to eating as well. 

Came here with a group of friends on a Monday afternoon for lunch. Even on a Monday this place was busy. Luckily, we got seated right away.

You save $1 on many of the menu items if you are a Total Rewards member, so don't forget to bring your card with you. One card will work for the entire table. As far as ordering goes, I recommend getting their burger combo deal. You get to choose any burger on the menu AND a ""Frrrozen Hot Chocolate"" for $26 (no sharing allowed). You get the most bang for your buck. Plus, you'll want that frozen hot chocolate all to yourself! 

I chose their Portobello Mushroom Burger (normally $18) for my combo. You get a choice of  fries or slaw. I chose the slaw, which was surprisingly good. You could really taste the hints of black pepper that balanced out the flavors. The burger also took me by surprise. I got my beef patty medium rare and it turned out flavorful and juicy. The combo deal was more than enough food. 

Mint chocolate fans, definitely spit out that extra dollar to get the mint frozen hot chocolate. It's simply amazing. Even my boyfriend enjoyed it and he's generally not a huge mint fan. if mint doesn't appeal to you, no worries. There are many different options to choose from.

I say it's worth the experience. I've been here once before for dinner and wasn't thoroughly impressed, but that mint frozen hot chocolate won me over the second time around.

No real reason for that, we have noticed the long lines for the restaurant on many occasions.  We went there on Monday at 11:30 am for lunch.  We had made reservations after reading Yelp reviews talking about having to frequently wait for a table.  At no time did we incur rude service.  Everybody was friendly.  We are used to Strip prices, so we weren't shocked by $15 sandwiches.  They did come with fries or for a $1 more, sweet potato fries.  

We were starving.  We ordered a Hawaiian pizza as other people nearby had them and they looked good.  It was quite good, didn't realize it was made with BBQ sauce but there was plenty of cheese and the crust was very good.  

The wife had a chicken sandwich and said it was very good.  It was good sized.  The sweet potato fries were probably the best we have ever had.  They were cooked long enough where they were crisp.  Plus, they put cinnamon on them.  I had the Rueben sandwich.  The corn beef was exceptionally lean and the rye bread was very good.  I wish it would have had a little more sauerkraut on it, but that was minor.  

For dessert, we got a piece of red velvet cake to go.  It was $14, way too much for my taste.  It was very good.  We did take a little more than half of our food home with us in the best carry-out containers we have ever seen.  
 
We didn't have the frozen hot chocolate, just because paying $11 seemed like an excess we couldn't take.  I wish I hadn't paid the $4 upcharge to get four onion rings instead of the fries.  The rings are heavily coated with parmesan cheese.  We love onion rings, but these just didn't cut the mustard.  

BOTTOM LINE:  The food was very good.  The wait person was very friendly.  Unfortunately, you can't be in a hurry to get your food.  Our wait person was working hard, but it took an extremely long time to get our meal.  The follow-up wasn't great, but not terrible.  Perhaps they should consider having some food runners.

I walked straight to the bar area (there are 2, one outside and one inside, I went to the one inside) waited for a good minute or two to finally head over to the hostess section, I asked where can I order takeout. She said to order at the bar.. i headed back to the bar said i wanted to do take out and ordered my drink..

The bartender then takes my order and tells me to wait near the hostess section and he'll drop it off there. *note no one was at the bar when I came. 2 minutes later a hand full of people packed up the bar and my drink was no longer made. waited another 5 minutes and the bartender is delivering food and drinks to people sitting at the bar where as I was just waiting.. Finally I went over and said to cancel my order.. He didn't ask me why or even try to change my mind. He went ahead and called the manager to cancel it for him... the manager ALSO DIDNT try to talk to me or ask me whats wrong.

STRAIGHT TO THE POINT: This establishment is poorly run.(period) customer service is out of the question when you're in Vegas. You lose one customer, but you gain 10 the next minute. I hope the NY location isn't like this place at all.

It's pretty huge, and you could definitely share the regular size.  My friends got the white chocolate frrrozen hot chocolate and the brownie sundae-both were okay.  We got to watch them make our drinks at the bar.  It tasted good, but it was just one of those things that I've always wanted to try at least once in my life.",2,1,3

My friends and I knew that their signature was the frozen hot chocolate so we decided to get two. One original and one cookies and cream. The original was good! Everyone says it is a chocolate milkshake but I beg to differ. It has a totally different texture and it is perfectly sweetened. As for the cookies and creams one it was good, but I would rather just stick to the original and not worth the additional $2 or so. 

Service was a little slow and it was really hard to get all the waitresses attention. However, they were all very nice and were very good when asked to refill our water and taking orders.

I'd thought I'd yelp it anyway to help with the ambiance because you may have visions of the new york serendipity as shown in movies, reality shows, etc.
After getting into Vegas- I had to hit up this place. It was 9pm or so and really was in the mood for one thing that's shareable and not a drink. 

We got the Forbidden Broadway Sundae which consisted of chocolate Blackout cake, ice cream, hot fudge topped with whipped cream. The cake was really thick- like brick thick and I think I needed more vanilla ice cream. If I just go by she said, my mom, sister and nieces had lunch there and shared a mac and cheese, blt, and frozen hot chocolate and thought the servings were HUGE. No kids menu so share.  My sister felt the water was g-ross.

As far as service- our little waitress girl was attentive enough, though I heard a table yell for her a few times. We were served by someone else and we had no napkins which gets gooey after awhile. 

I'll go back for the frozen hot choc.

Was really looking for a cool experience but it was very lackluster. The place is right on the strip and looks very bright and colorful. I'm seriously like a fish, so bright and colorful is right up my alley; this is what attracted me in the first place. 

We walked in through the outside bar area and it seemed a bit unkempt and smelled like sewer. Tables, counters, and walls looked sticky and gross. We eventually found the host desk and put a name in for a table. I think the hostess said 20-25 minutes...now, I understand that you need servers in order to cover whatever amount of tables you have available but there seemed like there were a lot of open tables...they were scattered and people were sat throughout the whole restaurant. But again, this is only my take on it - I could totally be wrong. 

We give the hostess our phone number so she can text once a table is available. Now, HERE'S THE TIP and it's an awesome one. Go out of the back of the restaurant and turn left. There is a to-go window with a pretty full menu AND there's a huge covered patio with tables and chairs AND they don't look as bad as the ones inside. 

We ordered a frozen hot chocolate, a scoop of ice cream, and a hot hot chocolate. The girl at the window wasn't the friendliest and it seemed like giving her my order was the most complicated task of the night. The order came out quick but again, lackluster. The frozen hot chocolate was ok but not worth $10. My $5 scoop of ice cream was served sloppily in a plastic cup, with ice cream dripping all over the side of the cup even though the scoop only took up the bottom quarter of the cup. From what I heard, the hot hot chocolate was ok but not the best.

1.  Prices are ridiculously expensive for majority of the food and drinks I remember when the Deep Fried Oreos used to be 14 dollars and now it's 18 IF you are a total rewards member
2.  The ice cream I received for the Black and White Sundae was old.  The waiter tried telling me that they get ""Fresh"" ice cream every day, but I'm a local who used to be a regular and I KNOW for a FACT how the ice cream is supposed to be like.  I'm pretty sure most of you know that when you put your spoon through ice cream it should be smooth and creamy, there SHOULD NOT BE ANY ice crystals inside of the ice cream making it a bit hard and chunky.  I mean its sad that the Ice cream at McDonald's is a lot more fresh than this place gave me for their Black N White Sundae.  Not only that but the Strawberry was pretty lazy to me if they raised the prices.  The reason why it's called a black and white sundae isn't because chocolate and vanilla ice cream, they used to have the strawberries in tuxedos now it's just half dipped in chocolate and white chocolate. I was dissatisfied with this and this was the first time I ever had to RETURN AN ORDER OF ICE CREAM
3.  The LV Burger was OK wasn't really worth the price to me at all.  If the price was lowered a bit it would have been a lot better.
4.  The people gave us the grasshopper in exchange for the horrible Black N White Sundae and it wasn't that great it was mediocre at best.  It was OK, but not anything too phenomenal at all.

It's a popular stop for tourists because it literally sits right on the Strip and is easily accessed by foot. I could spend hours talking about how much I hate the set up of Caesar's Palace, but I won't. Bottom line, when visiting Serendipity, park valet or else you will earn the calories you eat hiking not only through Caesar's but then following the breadcrumb trail to Serendipity outside.

There is always a wait, particularly on date nights (Fri\/Sat) and if you're not interested in dining in there's a walk-up counter where you can order to-go. It's not their full menu, but has their staple items. The wait is long, but you can get some great people watching in.

I'm not big on sweets, so their signature frozen hot chocolate was never a highlight for me although it is yummy and when spiked packs a dangerously delicious punch! However it was a little to sweet for me and true to the Serendipity theme of heart-stopping portion sizes. In a nutshell, it's instant diabetes, but likely worth it if you have a sweet tooth.

My favorite at Serendipity is the Caesar salad which I believe comes in two sizes: appetizer and King Kong. I was having as dinner so I got the larger size and wasn't able to finish it and I blame that partly on the amazing croutons that the salad is ""garnished"" with. Usually, croutons do just serve as a garnish, sitting humbly on top of a salad and delicately scattered throughout. On the Serendipity Caesar, the croutons take the main stage as they are not only enormous but the best damn croutons I've ever eaten. I can't even believe I just spent three minutes writing about them, but they are that good! They're buttery, garlicky and toasty (perfect combo!) on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside and I can't put my finger on what kind of bread they used as I've tried to replicate them at home and they never turn out like this. The dressing was perfect, and evenly distributed throughout the salad. Towards the end things got a little soggy as I tried to power through and not fall face first in food coma into the plate, but any salad will start to do that if it sits there long enough.

The staff and service is for the most part forgettable. The couple times I've been the staff has either been neglectful or incompetent with attitude which I guess is expected of a place that more often than not deals with walk-ins off the Strip who have been grossly over-served and are now trying to order a sandwich while belligerently drunk.

Yes, prices border on the outrageous, but the restaurant is on prime real estate and again, the place has no sense of portion control. All in all, a nice place to take hungry out of town friends.",1,1,0

The Frozen Hot Chocolate was soooooo rich and sweet. It was somewhat refreshing in the 90-100 degree weather but I couldn't even finish it. This is coming from someone that loves chocolate and sweets too. 

Also it was kind of pricey--about $10--for a sugar high. 

Don't bother with the Frozen Hot Chocolate.",1,0,0

I probably raised my expectations too high after drooling at all the photos on Yelp and wishing I were in Vegas.  The actual food was just average.  My friends' eggs benedict were so overpriced (but then again, everything in Vegas is 2-5x normal) and not worth.  My scramble was supposed to be made with egg whites and it turned out yellow.  I didn't bother asking them to redo it because they were so busy.  By the time I flagged down a waiter to put the order in, the rest of my party would be finishing up and ready to get the check.  The scramble had way too much spinach and the cheese not cooked enough.  

The frozen hot chocolate that everyone raves about was THE worst thing on the menu.  It was like eating chopped ice cubes and cocoa powder.  Just no.  Plus, it's not worth the price, maybe a little better if you share the larger size. 

For some real food that is worth your time and money, try getting out of the strip and supporting the local Vegas businesses.",19,9,11

We came for lunch and ended up having one of their sandwiches. Although tasty, not outstanding (why didn't they heat the bread?). I still liked it a lot and was one of the healthier choices on the menu (prosciutto, tomato, mozzarella sandwich!). Priced at $16, I thought it was a good deal! Their sandwiches are huge and also come with a side of either sweet potato fries or criss cross fries.

Their frozen hot chocolate is amazing, but I have to admit, it's pretty pricey if you think about it. It's really a glorified, super yummy, frappucino on steroids, with tons of chocolatey goodness. But at $10 for one cup, or $14, be prepared to shell out the dough!

The Frozen Hot Chocolate (at least a liter of chocolate milk with a pound of whipped cream) and Red Velvet Sundae (equivalent of two pints of ice cream and three to four cupcakes) were easily EACH large enough to feed four starving people. 

The Mac and Cheese with bacon was delectably outrageous! The drunkards at my table also ordered the chili and decided to create ""Chili Mac"" on the fly, devouring it between foodgasms. 

I channeled my own inner glutton and dipped hot, crispy potato wedges into the vanilla ice cream of my sundae. Don't knock in until you've tried it. When you do try it, remember I said, ""You're welcome.""

Let me say I came here with a friend who had a comp. All I knew about this place is that they have some frozen hot chocolate thing.  I didn't know they had actual food too. 

So we came in tonight for dinner.  We had a reservation.  We requested a booth and the hostess said no booths are available, so we chose outside. As we walked by we saw booths open and questioned her. She said ""we have other reservations before yours, sorry"" ok first off at least act like you care and don't get snotty. I seriously wanted to smack her in the back of her teenage-20 year old head and say use your manners! Hostess said we will let Shawn know you are here. 

So we walk outside and sat under these misters and wait for our server. Looking at this huge menu and being very confused as to what to order. Jeff our server was very nice he suggested a few things. We decided on the onion rings for an app, she had the meat pizza and I had the pulled pork. 

All the food looked yummy. The tower of onion rings looked good until we each cut one open to dip into the sauce. They were not cooked all the way there was raw batter inside. Jeff asked if would like another batch and we asked him if it was supposed to be like that. He said no. We said no thanks.  Nothing like under cooked food to really turn your stomach.  Already she said this is not going well for a second chance. And I agreed. Her pizza $21 looked good and tasted ok. Nothing to write home about. It had no outstanding flavor. My pulled pork sandwich barely warm came with cold fries $19. Which I didn't mind me that much (didn't want to seem like a bitch and send them back) and the pork was so dry. Not yummy juicy saucy pulled pork. The pineapple on top was good and grilled. 

For one soda, one iced tea and two entrees our bill would have been $48 plus tax and tip. We still left a tip, btw. Like I said we were on a comp. the manager shawn never came by to say hello even after our server Jeff said he knows about the onion rings. I am huge on customer service!!!! I've worked customer service and hospitality for 20 years. If one of my customers\/guests had a bad experience and I invited them back  to give us another chance.  You can bet there will be one of the managers there to visit them and make sure that they had a good visit!!!! 

This place is not cheap. It's not cooked well. It's obvious that managers do not care and the hostesses need training on how to give good customer service. 

I spend a lot of my free time as a diamond member enjoying everything that Caesars Entertainment's properties has to offer. I think they should rethink having this place carry their name or do some serious training. 

No need for management to contact me. I won't waste my time coming here again. Not looking for comps or any kind of freebies or discounts.

I ordered the chocolate and peanut butter version to share with my husband, and it was divine. Not sure what they do to make that peanut butter sauce, but I wanted to lick the plate and bowl clean! My cousin went with the original, which I guess she never deviates from. She took a taste of the peanut butter version, though, and quickly feel in love. How could you not? Chocolatey peanut buttery goodness covered in whipped cream? Yes, please! 

We actually went for breakfast on our last day in town. They were busy, but got steadily more so as we sat there. Our waitress was friendly but distracted; she might have had too many tables to worry about. 

I wasn't particularly hungry, but I knew that the portion sizes were large. Knowing, as well, that we'd be in a car for five hours, I decided to order the Fresh Bread Basket, in the hopes that whatever wasn't consumed at the table could be available for munching during the road trip home. My husband ordered the oatmeal and coffee, and my cousin got the Benedict. 

I admit to being more than a little disappointed in the bead basket. The items - biscuit, croissant, muffin and cinnamon roll - were anything but fresh. They weren't even warm. The biscuit, which my cousin was raving about (it was the base of her Benedict) was hard and crumbly and ice box cold. Crumbly I can handle. Cold and hard, not so much. I had to wash every bite down with a sip of water. The croissant was the best thing in the basket, and also the smallest, and the last thing I ate there. The muffin, half of the biscuit and cinnamon roll came with us for the trip. The muffin was the only thing consumed at a later date (my breakfast the following morning). The croissant and the muffin were definitely the best things on that plate. 

My husband enjoyed the oatmeal, but thought it was overpriced for what he got. I mean, it was oatmeal, after all, and even an apple crisp garnish can't fancy it up enough to justify the cost. 

My cousin, meanwhile, loved her Benedict. I guess that counts for something. 

I'd definitely want to go back, if just for the chocolate alone. I may want to give the food another shot, but it wouldn't be my first dining choice when in Vegas.",3,0,1

The food- the food selection looked really good on the menu. Everything is a tad on the pricey side, but oh well, this place is famous right?

They forgot one meal, one breakfast came out super cold like it's been sitting for a whiiiile, and my omelet was like super-cooked hard and dry. So 3 misses out of about 14 people, I guess I'll let it slide?

BUT, and this is a big but. They quickly resolved this issue by comping the meal they forgot and the meal that came out cold (and brought out a brand new one) (I didn't complain about my meal bc I don't like complaining at restaurants), and on top of that, gave us 2 frrrozen hot chocolates and a bloody Mary for our meal that was cold.

It's a place people visit for the novelty, so expect it to be crowded and busy during meal times and weekends.  A more efficient and professional wait staff would make the experience more pleasurable, but with a line of people waiting to get in, the servers don't seem to feel the need to impress anyone.

Pros:
Average food
People watching
Strip location

Cons:
Service
Food Quality

Over the past few years, I have been to the Serendipity a handful of times, most recently in late August of 2011.  My wife has this ""thing"" about visiting this place, but she's assured me that she's completely over the novelty\/fascination.  One look around and you'll know that everyone is here for the same reason - it's kind of funny\/cute...hey, it's Vegas.  Make sure you walk around and take in some of the sites and eclectic surroundings.  You can always get your food to go and eat outside, although it does get pretty hot during the daytime.

The food is average: stay with the sandwiches and burgers - you can't go wrong, the other items are hit and miss, for example, the crab cakes were fishy and gross.  Everyone gets the frozen hot chocolate or some other dessert - nothing special and not much different from what you'd get at your local ice cream parlor.  

YMMV depending on your expectations, taste in food, and luck: although I've always had poor service, if you are a group of very cute girls and you get a male server, you will get good service...know what I mean?  Unfortunately, it's ""that kind of place"" where the servers aren't professional and are easily distracted from their duties.  If they screw up your order, I suggest that you make the best of the situation and eat it because it will take an hour or two for the replacement dish to come out.

In my opinion, the Serendipity 3 in Vegas relies on the draw of their name and offers little more than an average dining experience on the Strip.  A few minor tweaks to the service and quality control of the food, and this place would actually be ok.  Keep in mind that there are places with worse food and poorer service, so don't be afraid to give it a shot if it's on your ""Vegas Do List.",2,0,0

There is nothing amazing or life changing or delicious about this drink.  It is not cool or inventive or intriguing.  It is a pretty boring slushy that takes like your typical hot chocolate made from a packet.

My tastes are usually discriminating but reasonable, and this drink did nothing for me.  I ate the whipped cream off the top, drank about 1\/4 of it, and tossed it.  Eleven bucks well spent.

I am guessing that their regular desserts are fine, but this seems to be some sort of a signature item, and it was a real disappointment.",0,0,0

Everything on the menu was huge, and smothered in cheese, or mayo, or chocolate, or whipped cream.  Or a combination of the above.  

Yet, underneath the breading and a heavy helping of mayo-based sauce, the crab cakes I got there were the best crab cakes found on the strip (for under a $100\/meal, anyway).  And the silly-looking cotton candy martini turned out to taste pretty good and not overly sweet.",0,0,0

we had heard about how good the grilled cheese was and given how much my wife loves grilled cheese sandwiches this seemed like a great fit.  unfortunately it was on the lunch menu and we barely missed it but we figured that we could ask and they could whip it together.  they told us that there would be absolutely no way they can do it.  we asked the waitress to ask the kitchen to see if they could but it and they said that there was no way.  mind you this is only about 15 minutes after the lunch menu was closed.  if they were out of ingredients they could've told us and we would've left it be but they just came off as there is no way we can do it.  so my wife ended up ordering a cheeseburger with no burger.  when the waitress came back after taking the order, the chef told her that they can make a grilled cheese.  awfully a lot of back and forth for just a grilled cheese sandwich!  so after all that, how was it?  meh.  we've had better and especially for a lot less money and hassle.  it was pretty oily from what we remember and the cheese wasn't at that nice melty stage that it should be at.

i ended up w\/ a chicken open-faced and the frozen hot chocolate.  the sandwich was OK but nothing i'd die to go back for.  the frozen hot chocolate was pretty good and better than the one i had in NY.  but it's just a slushier version of a milkshake.

it did the job.  we were hungry and it sustained us but the annoyance with getting a grilled cheese sandwich along with the mediocre food left a bad impression with us.  don't go here unless there's no wait and you just need something to tide you over to something better.",1,0,1

There must have been 3-4 large pieces of fried chicken and about 3 large pieces of waffles.  

We ordered the French Toast Log which was equally as large.  Taste wise, it, the Asian chicken salad and even appetizer buffalo chicken strips were great!  Then it was on to dessert!

I asked the bartender instead and he politely provided a glass of water.

We sat outside with a great view of the hustle and bustle of the LV strip, but it didn't bother me so much. I couldn't decide what to eat first, nothing spoke to me. I wanted veggies - so I  went for a salad. The Thai Beef Salad was refreshing and had a cute presentation, must of been the coconut half that served as a garnish. It was smokin' spicy - the chef went overboard on the thai chili, but overall it was good. There was more beef in the salad that I was able to consume. Hubby ordered clam chowder, he said it was average. 

Now for the main event - the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate hit the spot. It was rich and chocolatey. The ice or sugar flakes, whatever the heck it was took a while to get used to, but overall we enjoyed.

While they have fans with water misters, they don't reach certain tables.  I had to ask the hostess to move to a better table where we would get at least some mist.  The outside patio is covered by a pink tarp which gave everything a bright pink glare.  Bring sunglasses!

We were starving by the time we were seated.  We waited 5 minutes for a server to take our drink order.  By this time we already knew what we wanted to order so we placed our order.

It was Saturday morning and we assumed it would be busy. Once we got there we were told the wait would be 30 to 40 minutes which we were OK with. This issue I had was the amount of empty tables. How could the wait be so long if there were so many empty tables? When I asked the hostess she told me they didn't have enough servers so couldn't fill the tables. Are you kidding me? This is VEGAS and you know you are going to have a rush of people on Saturday and you don't have enough servers... definitely not good planning! Regardless we decided to wait around and eat here.

Asked them  is this gonna be too much for the two of us and he comments that it will be fine and the portions for one of the items is small. (Not really) meal in itself. W\/E. 

What really bothered me was their service.
So the waiter has been gone for a bit and notice the three waitresses talking by their station. I try to flag one of them down for a condiment and refill. Nope they are too engaged with their convo so i wait. Mind u im sitting at the closest table. Finally 3 mins later they disperse and two of them are still chattering about their relationship or w\/e and the older blonde waitress notices me and quickly comes over. Ask for a refill and gives me this attitude like shes talking down to me, and saids she will get the my waiter  to bring it out. Also ask for the condiment and cant really pass it off so grabs it from the station where she was chatting to my table 8ft away. 

IMO if everyone on yelp is complaining about the service. There is a reason. Go hire and train ur staff to be more professional, hire more for busy seasons instead of overworking ur current staff, balance out the female to male ratio, pay ur staff more so they put more effort and provide better service, hire one busboy will clean up and reduce service time, get rid of employees who come to work to socialize. 

sit there for 3 mins time 3 people is 9 mins of stuff something had to be done but got pushed back to be done later and provided slower service. Ive worked in an efficient sushi restaurant and so much stuff can be done in 9 mins.

They have tons to select from, whether you are hungry or just looking for a sugary treat to try. We did both, ordered a entree and ordered a dessert. For the entees we tried chicken and waffle, and chocolate chip pancakes. For the sugary treat we tried our first time experience with their mocha and white chocolate cold drinks.

It also had some sort of nuts on it that tasted like pine nuts.  Fresh basil was sprinkled on top.  The chicken strips were really good.  The batter is tempura so it was light and crispy. The chicken was juicy and there was a lot of it.  On the second trip, I had the same salad and we tried the ""can't say no"" sundae.

Serendipity 3 has a veggie burger on their menu that is really tasty. if you want it vegan, order it on sourdough bread with no butter or mayo.

My fiance (att) and I decided to start our strip journey by grabbing food at Serendipity and ordered the small frozen hot chocolate (that is perfect for two people, possibly a third depending on how much you eat) and a flatbread pizza that came with ricotta cheese and meatballs. Boy we're we disappointed with our main dish! There was nothing special or anything that stuck out about the crust of the pizza or the cheese\/sauce, but the big disappointment was the meatball and combination of ricotta cheese. We had eaten a combination of pizza like this before at a different restaurant, which is why we choose to go with this pizza, but it could not have been a more bland taste. I believe we only got one meatball on the whole pizza. Granted, the pizza isn't very big (more like an app.), but the meatball was sliced and lacked flavor. If I had eaten the meatball alone, with my eyes closed, I wouldn't have even guessed it was meatball! The ricotta also made the pizza taste even more bland and I think we were given huge dollops of it, because they skimped out on the meatball, but with it lacking taste, I guess it didn't matter. I was very regretful that I didn't order the chicken nachos, once I took a bite of the pizza. 
But the service was great. Even though it was busy, our waitress was very attentive and made sure our waters were filled up. My fiance HATES to waste food, but this was the first time that he didn't mind leaving the rest of the pizza behind. The price of the pizza definitely did not match up to the taste.

Huge desserts.  

I haven't had their food before, but the Vegas location passed the A-OK test.

I remember having the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, Peanut Butter Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, and their Banana Split at their New York location last year.  All were good (esp the peanut butter), but my senses can take only so much sugar.

This time around, I wanted a meal.  Wait time was nil.  Like their desserts, their food offerings were just as enormous.  The High Heel Pump (I felt fruity for ordering it, so I pointed to it when our server took our orders) had succulent prosciutto, arugula, tomatoes, and plenty of other healthy ingredients.  Once I was finished, my body craved more unhealthy food and juicy meat the way Harold & Kumar craved White Castle.  

So being the human trash compactor that I am, I finished my cousin's burger (the one with caramelized onions and melted brie) as well as part of my sister's Foot Long Hot Dog with all the fixings - relish, saurkraut, chopped onions, and a spiced mayonnaise.  It ain't no foot-long hot dog neeva!  It's gotta be 18"" (that's what she said).  As for the burger, it may have been a quality piece of beef, but it lacked salt.  At least it tasted clean and fresh.

The Strawberry Supreme drink was refreshing in that desert (not dessert) Vegas heat.  It had hints of Kool-Aid, fresh smoothie taste, and an unexplainable gratifying heft to it.  

I want to see someone order that $1,000 Golden Opulence Sundae.  Our server said she hasn't seen it, but her co-workers have and it's been ordered once a month for the past several months during the evenings.  Looks like I'll have to go back and win big.

Bottom line:  

Our server (Barbara) was as sweet as Serendipity's desserts (one of Sin City's finest), but this location's ambience lacked the charm and character of its New York sister.

I'm not a tourist, but if I WAS one, I'd avoid this place like the over-priced, over-hyped, over-indulged place that it is. 

I just went in for the aforementioned over-hyped frozen hot chocolate. What everyone has failed so far to mention is that this is not frozen anything. This is a richly watered down chocolate malt. It doesn't qualify as malt because it would have to have body to be that. This is like cold hot chocolate. 

I asked the waitress where my FROZEN hot chocolate was and she looked at me like I was an alien and said 'do you know what frozen is?' I refrained from sarcasm and told her I was well aware of the term 'frozen' having lived in NYC for years. She said that I wouldn't be able to eat it if it were frozen. I held myself back, barely, from explaining ice cream's properties. Suffice it to say that this is a dessert that is a lot of money for a lot of nothing. 

My guests and I also had the carrot cake which was divine, but it was still carrot cake and not worth the $11 price tag. We also had this very strange 'Forbidden Broadway Sundae.' I'll demystify it for you: it's chocolate ice cream with a LOT of whipped cream and a small slice of dark chocolate cake. For $11. You're welcome, I hope I've just saved you the money you would have spent on that. Buy me a drink when we meet, I promise your money's worth, which is more than I can say for this place. 

When I lived in NYC I always tried to tell my friends to stay away from the touristy areas, they are MADE to rip money from your hands with a paltry return. I give all Vegas tourists this same advice. There are much better places to indulge your sweet tooth than this scam.",3,3,3

OVERALL :

Based on the reviews I was a bit wary of going here, but the Husband and I had a surprisingly good experience. 

We purchased a Groupon and had no problem getting a table even when we showed up 25mins before our selected time. We strolled in a little after 1p on weekday and there wasn't a line.  Now, I'm sure if you wanted to sit outside (in the LV summer heat? you're nuts!) then you'll have a bit of a wait, but that's to be expected. One negative was the hostess who seated us, she didn't greet us nor said much. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and chock it up to her having an off day.

On a better note, our server was awesome! He was friendly and attentive. He even told us how they made the grilled cheese sandwich, ha. He was also on top of everything, refiling our drinks, making sure we got our Groupon and Total Rewards credit\/discounts. No issues here.

Food was good (we loved the fries!). It wasn't amazing, but it was good. We saved room for the Frozen Hot Chocolate because every table was getting one or two. It was good and the regular size is more than enough for two people to share. 

Verdict? Yum! Sure this place may be a bit overrated, but so what? If you haven't been before, you should experience\/try it at least once.  We enjoyed ourselves and would definitely come back.",2,1,1

Inside was much like outside, a homage to a perceived idea of what an old fashioned soda pop store would look like with white chairs, small white tables, checkered floor, striped wallpaper and old fashioned designed signs on the walls. Visually it is a stunning place. 

Our server was cheerful, but rarely present. She had a rushed sense about her even though it didn't appear overly crowded or understaffed. She would rush to our table, take our order, rush away. There always seemed like she needed to go somewhere. 

The breakfast menu read of sugary sweet items with a few classic egg dishes. My friends ordered the frozen hot chocolate which promptly came out first. It was served in a giant glass cup, or perhaps a small bowl, heaping with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles. I'm sure they served it in glass to convince the skeptic that indeed there was chocolate in there. Theirs was a peanut butter chocolate concoction and one that distinctly tasted like peanut butter hot chocolate. 

I ordered the cinnamon bun French toast. It came out on a long narrow plate with three pieces, each the size of my hand. Kinda wished they offered two size options because three was a little much. They were crunchy on the edges, but gooey soft in the center. The maple syrup was classic and unremarkable.

However, once I went inside, the bartender oddly pretended that the 2 for one (Margarita) coupon I had, wasn't good for this location.

I was disappointed with the Frozen Hot Chocolate; I was really expecting it to taste like chocolate - rich and luscious. Can you blame me? Unfortunately, it was overly icy and the chocolate flavor was super mellow, watered down with a slight hint of sweetness. The massive amount of whipped cream on top was the sweetest part of the entire drink, but that's not saying much since the ratio of ice overpowered every other flavor we tasted. 

The ""regular"" $13 sized original frozen hot chocolate was shared between my boyfriend and I just fine. For us, it was the right amount. They also had a size ""for two"" $17, but I'm glad we didn't opt for the larger size. It was bland, watery and not memorable. 

I would say the best part of the experience  was sipping the same cup as my date, it was really cute and romantic. So if you're not looking to be wow'ed by flavor or quality, I would suggest taking your date here for some cute ol' romance and that's about it - I don't see myself making my way out there for any other reason.

The frozen hot chocolate comes in a gradient of layers, the bottom being liquid and gradually icing up to the top. It's silky smooth icy texture is hard to explain. It is nothing like a Slush Puppy nor a Wendy's Frosty. It's just perfect and leave you wanting more. Both the Original and the Peanut Butter version is delicious.

Nachos: WoW! Huge! and Delicious! Comes with Guac, Pico De Gallo and Sour Cream on the side.

ABC (Avocado. Brie and Caramelized onions) Burger. Sweet potato fries were a little soggy. Burger was okay. Just Okay. Brie was overpowering.
Chicken Caesar Salad: It comes as 2 hearts, dressed with sauce. Bread so you can make your own croutons and Chicken the size of 2 chicken breasts. This was pretty good but not the best I've ever had.

I had gone previously and ordered from the TO-GO for their infamous frozen hot chocolate.... let me tell you 

DO

NOT

ORDER

TOGO

IF YOU WANT THE FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE.

Why?

1) The plastic cup isnt insulated enough to keep your frozen hot chocolate at the ideal temperature.
2) The cup is too tall (served at your table it is in a wide bowl) so the layers separate and you get ice\/water on top... not good
3) There just isn't enough whipped cream and chocolate shavings!

So, since this place IS famous for their frozen hot chocolate, do yourself a favor and get it the way it was meant to be served:
at the table, in a bowl, heaped with whipped cream. 

It is SO SO SO chocolatey - huge plus - with out being too bitter, creamy but not heavy, cold but not cold enough to induce a brain freeze... it was great. 

5 stars for the frozen hot chocolate, but the wait, the fact that the out door patio is FREEZING, and the fact that the rest of the menu is mediocre (good, but overpriced and probably not worth it) brings it to 4 stars.

The food is pretty decent, and I usually only come here for one...or two reasons. I absolutely LOVE their ""Don't Drop Your Skirt"" steak. It's a skirt steak with chimichurri sauce. Whatever marinade they're using for that skirt steak is divine. What makes this dish better though is if you pair it with their truffle mac & cheese. If you're going with one other person, the best thing to do is order both and share it. Let me tell you, it's worth it. Everytime I bring someone here, we won't order anything else. 

They have a full bar inside and they're also known for their mojitos, which are very good. I recommend the blueberry peach mojito!! Be careful though, they tend to use so much mint that it can get stuck in your straw. 

The reason why I did not give this place the full five stars is because the service is a hit or miss. I understand that they're a busy place but our waiter took so long to ask us for drink orders, forgot our drinks, and then didn't even check on us during our meal. He also took so long with our checks. And stuff like that happens usually happens whenever I'm there.

Omg, delicious. I love anything with chocolate fudgggeeee. This sundae is sensational.  The marshmallow cream is sweet, yet decadent it something I have never tasted before.  
I can easily eat three orders of this sundae.  The size of the sundae is pretty large it is made for sharing of two. But if you love desserts as much as I do, I believe you can finish it all by yourself, like I have ;] 

#2: T he Forbidden Broadway sundae: It has a chocolate blackout cake with  Chocolate & Vanilla Ice Cream that includes hot Fudge & whipped cream.  Reason I love this sundae because it has hot fudge. mmmmmhhh.  The chocolate cake is a little too sweet for me, but the vanilla ice cream compliments it very well.  If you love chocolate this would be the one for you. 


Another Sundae I have tried is the  Grasshopper Marshmallow Mint Explosion 
Which includes a mint chocolate chip ice creams with  Marshmallow Sauce & Hot Fudge & it is topped off with whipped cream & chocolate mints.  When I first saw this sundae it looked like grass and I would think it tasted like those wheat-grass shots you would take at a gym or some health store.. With that being said, I liked it but the way they made it was very much like a milkshake for some reason?

All these things I've heard from people about their desserts are all wrong. I mean don't get me wrong, they are good. But it's just average good. You can get the same taste at cheesecake factory.

We ordered the so called famous frozen hot chocolate, chilli cheese fries, nachos, spudnicks, and a number of other sundaes. Nothing really stood out for me. The frozen hot chocolate tasted like a hot chocolate flavored frozen yogurt that you can get at numerous froyo places. The nachos had about 30 peices of chips with a spoonful of cheese and beans. I literally wasted half of the nachos because they just didn't have any cheese on them. The spudniks were ok. They can compare to Jack in the box cheddar potato wedges.

We had to wait for about 20 minutes to be seated, but it made sense. Saturday night in Vegas, what good restaurant wouldn't be packed at 7pm? Once seated my boyfriend and I decided to order from their monster meal deal menu. Basically, they have a list of appetizers and entrees that you can choose from for $20. He ordered the spaghetti and kobe beef sliders for both of us. When the food came out, we noticed that only one order was brought out. The waiter had misunderstood and thought we wanted one order to share. Even though it was our fault, he gave us a free frozen hot chocolate for two for having to wait!!

- The Kobe Beef Sliders were deeelicious. The sauce that they have inside of the sliders and on the place is perfect. It added the right amount of flavor to an already flavorful patty.

- The spaghetti was very flavorful. The monster meatballs were a PERFECT combination of veal, pork, and beef (the meat lover's dream!). They were extremely flavorful. The noodles were thicker than most spaghetti noodles, but cooked perfectly making the dish very filling.

- The frozen hot chocolate is definitely a must try. The frozen chocolatey goodness was topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. We ate\/drank the whole thing!

- The root beer! The root beer was different from most root beers I've had at restaurants. It was very soft and had a slight creamy taste to it. It was very good.

I would definitely come back here again to eat, but I would make a reservation next time I plan on doing so.",4,0,2

Being the coffee addict that I am, I ordered the frozen mocccchachino hot chocolate and my sister was craving onion rings.  

Frozen mochachino ($11): We ordered the regular size and I must say this was pretty tasty butttt not worth the money.  I feel that I can make a mocha drink, pop it in the freezer, and then take it out and it would taste just the same.  Delicious but way overpriced

Onion rings ($9): these were big FAT onion rings!  I thought these were pretty tasty.  The only way I will eat an onion is if it is fried!!!  They sprinkled some parmesan cheese on it which I thought was kind of odd but I tolerated it by dunking it in ranch and BBQ sauce.

Overall, its a cute place with great service, but the food was just mediocre to me.  I wanted to experience it but this place was just had to much hype.  I MIGHT come back to try their other food items..maybeee....

When we arrived the next day I was surprised to discover that the restaurant was dead. In NYC we would be fighting outside for seats. Dont expect anything special of the decor like in NYC. This place is huge empty space, kinda biring to be honest. We sat down and I ordered. The staff here was friendly but completely unorganized and confused. Its like everyone is new to the biz here. Not good. I ordered the onion rings tower, mac n cheese with pancetta, and a frozen hot chocolate.

The onion rings were very tasty and came with ranch and bbq sauce. Both sauces were tasty too.

The mac n cheese was very tasty and it was filled with a generous amount of pancetta.

I have had countless drozen hot chocolates at the NYC location over the years. What they brough to the table tasted nothing like it. I am so disappointed because honestly this is what I came here for. Teo otgers in the know at ourbtablr agreed. Great disappointment!!!!!

If you don't want to wait for a table then do yourself a favor and sit at the bar. Since we were only there so I can try the frozen hot chocolate, we didn't mind sitting at the bar.  I ordered the classic frozen hot chocolate and the bf had the oreo frozen hot chocolate. All I can say was mine was better!... Soo yummy! it's like having an icy milkshake and u can kinda chew chocolate sugar crystals ( thats the best i can describe it). I WANNA GO BACK TO VEGAS TO HAVE THIS AGAIN! LOL.
They also have a to go window outside.

TRY THIS PLACE AND U WON'T REGRET IT. if  you're going to order a regular size of the frozen hot chocolate, get one for u and u only..cuz trust me...U WILL FINISH IT AND WOULDN'T WANT TO SHARE IT.

I had thought about coming here many times before, but the crowds always made me decide against it. This time the wait was ""only"" 20 minutes, so we decided just to walk around Caesar's for a while and give it a try.

Our food was unremarkable at best. My Chorizo Quiche was cold with one big clump of under seasoned sausage in the middle. My Girlfriend ordered the Huevos Rancheros.  The best she could say about them was that they were ok...not a ringing endorsement!  I can't even remember what her daughter ordered, but I do remember her liking it, but not being overly impressed by it.

I did get the Frozen Hot Chocolate, which was the highlight of the meal. Rich and Creamy with intense Chocolate flavor. If I ever come back, I think I'll just get dessert and skip the food. They are Wheelchair Accessible and our server was very nice.",6,1,3

None of us were hungry at all, but we all wanted to try the famous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, so we just decided to split one. There were 5 of us, so we ordered a large, for $14!!

We ordered from the window in the back, so we didn't even see what the inside looked like, and there was no line at 9:30 PM. The large drink was ready in about 5 minutes...wow! It was freakin huge and it had about 4 inches of whipped cream on the top!

All 5 of us had a sip, and agreed that it was awesome, nice rich chocolate, thick and creamy, definitely a chocolate lover's dream come true. Unfortunately, since it was so thick, it was quite filling, and we ended up throwing over half of it away. We should have gotten a small.

The chocolate was good. But I am not sure if ""good"" is good enough to justify its fame. I don't foresee myself craving it anytime soon, and definitely cannot fathom how people would wait for hours in NYC for a table at Serendipity.

The portion are large but not that flavorful, kind of boring and expensive. Our table ordered breakfast and two frozen hot chocolates. The cookies and cream frozen hot chocolate is still the best, I strayed and ordered the Amaretto one, which was okay, but I felt like there was only a tiny bit of almond flavoring- so after the first few sips the flavor was gone.

We came here for a late dinner after a show. We walked from The Venetian and though it didn't seem like the restaurant inside was crowded, we waited about 20 minutes for our table. It's a large menu with their versions of basic food items. I ordered the chicken burger with the blue cheese and BBQ sauce, but asked to hold the BBQ sauce. To me, blue cheese and BBQ sauce don't go together. I got that with the regular fries. We also got the Turkey Club and sweet potato fries, a side mixed salad, root beer float and a Frozen Hot Chocolate. We got our drinks and proceeded to wait. and wait. I guess I shouldn't have assumed that the Frozen Hot Chocolates were more like dessert, especially when I had ordered a root beer float. But I was wrong because the waiter brought out our Frozen Hot Chocolates before our food. He was nice to split it for us, but I just wasn't ready for it and really... it tasted like soupy chocolate ice cream. Ended up that we took a couple sips and it went to waste because we were waiting for the food. The club sandwich ended up being like any other sandwich. Cold cuts from the grocery store and bacon. No mustard. Nothing original about it. The chicken sandwich had a nice big piece of chicken, but, it had the BBBQ sauce on it. When I told the waiter, he said, ""I asked them not to put the BBQ sauce on."" He asked if I wanted a new one. It's a nice offer, but I've waited this long.. I'm going to have to wait longer? So, I asked, ""Is it going to take long?"" He tapped me on the shoulder and said, ""Of course, it's chicken"" Uh huh. So, if I asked for a cold lunch meat sandwich redo, it wouldn't have taken as long? And, by the way, the cold cuts were cold. But, he ended up taking the chicken sandwich off the bill. Even with that, I was disappointed. Food is way overpriced and not that good. Lesson learned.",0,0,0

I went in looking for what to try... noticing that the prices were a little above average (that's a given), but there are some specialty deserts that are $700+ and $1k+ INSANE!!! 

No I didn't spend that kind of money on something that melts. We asked the bar tender what Serendipity is known for and what is a ""must try"". I guess the one in NY there's always a line out the door for the Frozen Hot Chocolate. So that's what we got, while it was on it's way I saw the bar tender make some really yummy looking drinks apparently it was a Berry Mojito and a Strawberry Cheesecake Mojito! And just because it was Vegas and you can... I said ""I'll take one of each to-go as well"". 

My thoughts, the Frozen Hot Choc was average, nothing I would stand in line for hours for. It's like a chocolate shake basically that's rich and tastes like it has frozen micro ice in it... the flavor is just that ""hot chocolate""..... The mojito however.. OMG, yum! I'm not one to like greenery in my alcohol, but these were exceptional. The Cheesecake one is good if you like syrupy and sweet. My personal favorite was the Berry Mojito.

I know a lot of people want to try this place out because of it's famous NY location.  My opinion is that you're better off going somewhere else.

It's like 100+ degrees with a decent sized line and the cashier is moving like molasses.  I don't understand how come he is so slow, he is only taking orders...not filling orders.  It's odd when the line at fast food chains can move so fast while this place moves so slow

And the wait would be worth it if the food was amazing...but it's not.  The frozen hot chocolate (which i believe is their signature item) is nothing more then a glorified frappuccino that costs 2-3x as much as the starbucks version.

And i got a grasshopper marshmallow mint sundae that was as disappointing as humanly possible.   It's like 50% vanilla ice cream, 50% whipped cream, a bunch of mint chocolate chunks and possibly some marshmallow syrup?  I couldn't even taste any marshmallow.

Ok, so my husband and I got to Serendipity 3 at a decently off time. Didn't look too busy, so we put our names on the list and took a seat outside. We overheard someone say that if you sit at the bar you'll get served faster and you don't have to put your name on the list, so we tried that....didn't work. There are 4 or so chairs at the bar, so there went that idea. More waiting, waited so long that we had to eat a snack bar I had in my bag....before we ate lunch! I think our wait totaled about an hour for just the 2 of us. We were seated and it took our waiter 10 minutes before he came over to greet us and take our drink orders. Found out a few of the items that were on the menu were not supposed to be on there any longer (one of the items I was going to order, figures), so my husband ordered the grilled cheese with tomato soup and I ordered the mac & cheese. Simple enough. Our free frozen hot chocolate came out in this giant sundae glass,it was amazing! So good! We were expecting a tiny glass since it was free, but this could have fed a family of 4! Our food came out 35 or so minutes later, and my mac & cheese tasted like lighter fluid! It was so gross that even thinking about it right now makes me gag a bit. My husband's grilled cheese was gross too, same lighter fluid taste. Even his soup tasted like lighter fluid! I assumed it was the way they were cooking things so we brought this to the waiter's attention. He took my food back and came back to tell us that the cooks had no idea why it tasted like that and that no one else had complained. He offered to replace my gross food with something else, so I ordered a hot dog. Figured it would be safe since it wasn't covered in whatever gross cheese they were using. 

We waited for my hot dog for 30 minutes!  A HOT DOG! I'm kind of hypoglycemic so by this point I was feeling pretty weak. I started spacing out, feeling nauseated, it was all I could to stay calm. My hot dog FINALLY came and I was at that point in my 'episode' where I was super nauseated, so I took a few bites and got a to-go box, which took another 10 minutes. It was just annoying how much time we spent waiting and the food wasn't even good. I ate my hot dog an hour or so later after I was feeling better and it was pretty good. If I ever went there again i'd go straight for that and a frozen hot chocolate, that's it. And i'd get it from the to-go window, not even bother going inside. My husband is curious about this giant donut we saw in the to-go window, so we might check that out next time. Not going out of our way though.",0,0,0

- The wait for our food was horrendous
- One friend waited to the point when everyone at the table was almost done until his food came and it was the wrong order
- However, he got HIS for free, but it took a lot of pulling teeth to have it complimentary
- I ordered the nachos - it was a bit dry and by this I mean that it needed a LOT more cheese, guac, and salsa
- Frozen hot chocolate was fabulous 

This third time I went:
- I ordered the chili; it is worth getting because it comes in a pretty big bowl
- Got a side of garlic bread to dip because I had thought that it came with some bread but it did not

We chose to sit outside.  The hostess was rude taking us to our table she did not smile once and we basically had to jog to keep up with her.  When she was handing us our menus she was cold and rude.  Our waitress then came and was okay at first but after about 20 minutes was the same as the hostess no smiling and rude.  I ordered the frozen hot chocolate and let me tell you it was not worth the $11.00! It was all whipped cream and the couple sips I did take I got chunks of ice! Our waitress brought us our bill and didn't come back for about 20-30minutes!! We all got up to go find her but by then she came back.

There was that one scene where they were sharing that amazing looking frozen hot chocolate.  Because of that, I always vowed that I would make it to Serendipity in NYC and try the hot chocolate myself.  

However, as many times as I visited NYC, i NEVER made it to Serendipity.  So, on this last trip to Vegas, my girlfriends and I made it a point to put it on our to-do list to make it there.

We fulfilled this goal right away as we made Serendipity our first food stop in Vegas.  The inside is cute and old-school ice cream fountain like, but we sat outside on their large patio.  Serendipity has a great location (in front of Cessar's on the Strip), but that's about all it has going for it.  Granted, it's the Strip, but their food is ridiculously overpriced (entrees AND ice cream).  I get that the ice cream portions are huge, but $15 for dessert?!  C'mon now people.

I didn't realize they served up a full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu and the portions are heart attack sized.  The plates looked amazing as they went out of the expo window and into the dining room.  But we weren't there for that, we wanted dessert!

Dessert - I settled on the Party Like It's Your Birthday Cake and my gosh am I so happy I did.  Everything I wanted combined into a dessert.  Think Neapolitan Ice cream stuffed between multiple layers of fun birthday cake and topped with a wonderful whipped cream icing and topped with dip-n-dots?  It was heaven in my mouth.  The slices of cake are $16 which might sound absurd except for the fact that it's really 3 slices in one and enough for about 4 normal people to share.  

If you've just hit the jackpot in Vegas, you can also get the $1,000 Golden Opulence Sundae...sadly I was not in that position.  

Cons - It would have been a 5 star experience for me if not for the fact that no one seemed to want to help us order and sit where we wanted.  It was a Wednesday night, so not a crazy crowd by there standards and we wanted to sit outside on the patio.  Front patio was closed for the night which was understandable since it was 11:00PM.  They said there was no service on the back patio and to order at the pickup window outside if we wanted to eat there.  Okay.  So we went to the pickup window and were told we can only order cake from inside.  Okay, so we went back in and told the hostess who then said we had to order at the bar for take out.  Fine.  I asked the bar tender if we could have it plated instead of boxed up because I enjoy the experience of the way things look in store as opposed to a plastic container.

Came here with a group of friends for their frozen hot chocolate. It was dinner time as well so we went ahead and ordered food.

I got the custom pizza and added mushroom, spinach and chicken. The mushrooms were really tasty, the spinach was just there for more veggies, and the chicken was meh (texture was almost mushy, little flavor). I probably would've awarded this place three stars if not for the amount of cheese. I separated the cheese from the crust and the thickness of the cheese was twice the crust. And the crust was soggy. I ended up eating the toppings and the outside crust where it was still crisp.

I took a few bites of my girlfriend's ahi tuna salad. It was decent, except I quickly realized that there was too much dressing, and the dressing was too sweet. Otherwise the tuna was slightly spicy and the greens looked fresh.

I had always seen this place, but I have never eaten here before, so I was excited to see finally what the whole fuss was about.

The hostess sat us down, and we waited for our waiter. When our waiter arrived, he has such an fun, quirky, and amiable attitude that it made him very memorable. His name is Carlos if you ever want to request his service; so great. Anyways, we told Carlos our issue that we had 45 minutes to eat - so Carlos made it easier for us and recommended the Nachos as it was 1) easy to make 2) affordable 3) arrives fast. We agreed to that! 

He worked with urgency, and even though he was waiting on someone else who arrived before us, he made sure we had enough time to eat. Bam! Nachos with waters came in about 10 minutes... not kidding. When I saw the nachos, I gasped because they were HUGE... easily 3 people can eat off these nachos and still be full. Even though my mother and I were in a hurry... we finished on time all because of Carlos. Yes, this place can be a bit pricey, but I assure you that you should always try to split the food as the portions are huge!

Having been to the NY and Miami locations previously, we were greeted with the same color palette as the other locations, but the general splendor I remembered was lost at the Vegas strip locale. This one felt dull and a bit on the rundown side to me. Our large table was lopsided and sloped to the left a bit, the pleather seats in the booth had small rips. 
Making a 6:15 reservation and showing up 20 minutes early, we were happy to hear they still had our table for 8 available and the wait wouldn't be necessary. After being seated, and perusing the menus of salads, pizza, burgers, hot dogs, and of course a wide variety of ice cream sundaes on the back, we placed our order. 
While our drinks and food seemed to take an extraordinarily long time to arrive, I must say our server was quite nice. 
Their bathrooms were out of order so we had to walk over to Caesars to wash our hands or use the facilities which I personally found annoying, as with younger children present, using the bathroom is about an every 20 minute necessity. The walk is a about 10 minutes each way. 
Basic children's menu items such as grilled cheese, Mac and cheese, hamburgers and teddy bear pancakes were ordered, the adults chose the Chinese Chicken Salad and grilled chicken sandwich.  Everything was just okay, nothing was outstanding (other than my daughter loved the grilled cheese). 
Each child ordered a smaller sundae, the vanilla ice cream with brownie and hot fudge was a hit, the chocolate ice cream with whip cream and rainbow sprinkles was said to be good. However, the famous frozen hot chocolate tasted like burnt plastic, not good at all! 
Bill minus tip was $235, not ridiculous for a party of 8 on the strip. Would I return again? Only for a specific occasion as the poor food quality, inconvenience of parking, no bathroom in the restaurant and lack of whimsical ambiance was not impressive enough to bring me back anytime soon.",4,1,2

We ordered the frozen hot chocolate for 2, Alfredo pasta with salmon, and the Asian chicken salad. The portions are actually pretty big here. We didn't finish the pasta or salad because we were pretty full already. I thought my pasta was good, but there was way too much sauce. The pasta and broccoli were practically drowning in the sauce. They did give me a generous portion of salmon though. I also tried the bf's salad. I thought it was pretty good, but he didn't like it because he doesn't like the taste of the bamboo shoots in it.

We ordered the mini sliders, chili cheese dog, corn dogs, nachos, fries, and frozen hot chocolate. 

The BEST part was the frozen hot chocolate! When i went to pick up our order, they had forgotten the corn dogs, so for my wait, they gave me a free large frozen hot chocolate! The other stuff was just kind of blah, not great, but still yummy. The only thing I wouldn't order again were the nachos. The chili cheese dog was pretty good and the sliders were really juicy!

Foot long hot dogs - are super dooper big!

My husband couldn't get enough of the peanut butter frozen hot chocolate, so we were really excited to see this place open for business and much closer to home.

Can you really compare it to the original? Not so much. It lacks the ambiance and character, and the menu is not the same...but neither is the wait time, which scores points with anyone who has waited the standard 2 hours at the original for just a frozen hot chocolate. Cool that they have a take-out window as well.

The inside dining room is just one big open room, a little crowded and awkward especially since there isn't really a waiting area, so people  were just hovering around by the door. Though we didn't dine on the patio I think this would be more fun, especially since it sits right on The Strip. 

The menu was not the same - seems like they made it more commercial or fast food-ish, but let's be honest, you should be going here for the desserts anyway. We had both the sweet potato fries and the waffle fries, both were good, standard fries. Don't order the nachos - they are awkward to eat and I had to pick off all the unseasoned ground beef that was not appetizing at all. The clam chowder was good though, had a little spice to it. 

My husband claimed the peanut butter frozen hot chocolate wasn't as ""peanut buttery"" as from the original, but he downed it anyway. I couldn't tell the difference.

Overall though, it's probably not worth what it costs to actually eat a meal here. It's certainly a little on the pricey side.

We sat at the bar with the big screen just in plain sight for us to enjoy the soccer game while we were already enjoying the ambiance, food and drinks. I ordered the Bloody Mary, which was biting and peppery just how I like it. But if you like it like soup, you would need to mention non-spicy. 

I got the Orchard Salad. It's tossed with vinaigrette, cubes of chicken breast, spinach, pecans, dried cherries, apples, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, feta crumbles and apple slices. 
Hubby got an omelette, forgot which one, but it was huge, beautifully fluffy and not greasy at all and it came with their crispy yummy seasoned fries.

We wait, we wait, we wait some more. Finally I get a text message our table is ready. While this feature is really cool here's where it goes all wrong.  Only one hostess behind the stand [not good].

We sit down. We ask for the Las Vegas Dining Menu.  Which is difft from what's on the site, but OK no biggie.  It also wasn't offered to us???  boooooo   PS- We are spending a fixed cost of $30.12 for lunch that's how this deal works so we aren't expecting to have a 'cheap meal' here.

We always share our food here and order something smaller but even then we still had too much food. Ordered the hangover omelette and that was actually good. Ordered the kids French toast, 2 regular pieces of toast for $8! Plain croissant larger than the norm $4! Ordered the frozen hot chocolate to go and that was $12! Forgot how expensive it was for a normal grande size drink!

As a result, I decided 3 star is over rated.  I think 2 stars is about right here is why:

Average dish is around $11-$15.  What i ordered is the

East SIde Omelette- The eggs were too dry and hard.  

Steak Sandwich- Steak meat is hard............ and it came with cheese and egg.  It felt like a case of bad heart burn as I tried to swallow it.

Frozen Chocolate- Taste like you add nestle coco powder with ice and whip cream.  Not good.

Ice cream sundae- I forgot which one I ordered, its the famous one.  Its a HERSHEY syrup madness with SUPER sugar brownie, with tons of whip cream plus ice cream.  If you need a sugar rush, eat it, or else, its nothing special.

Vegetable Quiche- IT was ok.  I had better.

The graham crackers were good and sort of smushy in the cup and I think it had chocolate kisses in it. It was ok. I also shared a frozen Oreo hot chocolate with me friend. It's not something I ever need to try again. The decor of this place is also awful in my opinion.

The girlfriend and I decided to try this place out for lunch since it was convenient and also because they were participating in restaurant week during our stay. They offered a pre-fixed 3-course menu for around $30.10 each. This was a great deal but we always do such an awful job ordering and we always tend to over order 90% of the time. So we both went for the 3 course meal for lunch, and BTW 3-courses for lunch is ALWAYS overkill. But what the hell we were in Vegas.

Appetizers:
Kobe Sliders - Nothing really special about the sliders just the usual run of the mill mini burger. It definitely wasn't the worst but it wasn't the best either.
Tropical Tuna Tacos - These tacos were a pleasant surprise! For some reason I was expecting some cooked tuna in a corn tortilla. But instead we got a pretty large portion of sliced raw tuna in a hard shell with mango salad on top. The flavor was amazing. The mango salad complimented the tuna wonderfully. This was probably my favorite dish of the afternoon.

Main Course:
Spaghetti and Meatballs - The meatballs in this dish were pretty delicious. Nice size and flavor. The sauce... not so much. The sauce tasted like it was from a can... =(. But if you are eating lunch at serendipity I would suggest on passing this dish because it is just way too much. I barely even touched half of the dish, the portion was humongous!
The Full Monty - Grilled All White Chicken Breast, Melted Monterrey Jack Cheese, Grilled Red Onion, Arugula, Bacon & BBQ Sauce on Ciabatta Bread. This was actually pretty damn good, a lot better than the spaghetti and meatballs. This was once again pretty large sandwich so order accordingly. Oh yeah, it also came with some sweet potato fries and those were nom nom nom. 

Dessert:
This is where we made the mistake. With this menu we ended up with TWO Frozen Hot Chocolates! This is was wayyyy too much. In my opinion, one is good enough for two. So we barely even touched our second Frozen Hot Chocolate, we wanted to give it away but we had already taken a sip of it (I know we are creepy). We ended up getting the classic and the Oreo flavor. The OREO was way better than the classic. The classic seemed tasteless, but on the other hand the Oreo one was super sweet! To each his own. I wasn't too impressed by these ""Infamous"" frozen hot chocolates.

No old guys still wearing Ed Hardy (or even worse trying to be cool with a blazer and jeans.... come on guys that is so 2002, put on some slacks.).  But know, Serendipity 3 is a Vegas attraction so be prepared to pay accordingly.

THE FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE - is amazing.  Absolutely amazing actually, it is no fluke that so many people enjoy it.  It is everything you imagine and more.  I compare it to an experience of eating a Jelly Bean and saying to yourself ""OMG this popcorn jelly bean does taste like popcorn"".  I'm not sure why I didn't expect the frozen hot chocolate to taste like well, frozen hot chocolate.... but it did.  This is a must try, repeatedly.

2 FOR 1 MARGARITAS - OK, I'm not exactly sure what creative genius decided to pair dessert and margaritas but they did... and boy am I thankful.  For one the Margaritas are LARGE and in charge.  AND, yes there is more... they actually have liquor.  Most of the time there is so much of that limey mix and no tequila... not here, they give you your monies worth.

They had the name, they had the flare, they had the location... but they just did not have the food. With those prices, I think I could have gone to one of the restaurants opened by a celebrity chef and be more satisfied.

We ordered a burger, and it was so well done that I could have surely used it to play frisbee. We told the server and he promptly changed it. We asked for a medium burger, and the second attempt was well done also, but at least it wasn't AS dry. Hey burger chef, stop pressing the patties down with your spatula while they cook. Thanks.

The chicken sandwich was also dry, and the bread was hard. Inedible.

The best thing was probably the chili, but even that wasn't anything spectacular.

We got two frozen hot chocolates, which basically saved the meal. They weren't the best thing I've ever had (think of a chocolate slushie), but compared to everything else we had, it was awesome. We got the original and the amaretto almond. I personally like all the little almond pieces in the amaretto one better than the original.

I gave them an extra star because it was my husband's birthday and they gave him a little chocolate dessert thingy with a candle.

My older sister raved about this place for days, and I couldn't understand why until I actually had the chance to visit. I'm usually not a fan of ice cream, but Serendipity's sundaes got me hooked! I definitely left the place feeling a few pounds heavier, but it was well worth the price.

My friends and I ventured to Vegas and decided to come here since it was 100+ degrees outside. We ordered:

Frrrozen Hot Chocolate (~$10): Awesome. It really does taste like hot chocolate, albeit cold. This is probably the best dessert to get if you're really watching your budget but still want a taste of Serendipity's goodness. My friends finished this super quick, and they don't normally have sweet tooths.

Audrey's ""Can't Say No"" Sundae (~$14): Oh, my gosh. I think I had a heart attack while eating this since there was so much sweetness, but it was super tasty! It includes humble pie with peanut butter cream on graham cracker crust. I tried super hard to finish this, but the sizes for all the sundaes are gigantic. It's got enough ice cream to feed 3 people, but you may not want to share after having a bite.

Strawberry Fields Sundae (~$14): Wow, I don't think any other strawberry dessert I've had hits the spot as much as this one. The cheesecake definitely compliments the strawberry ice cream, and overall it just works. Definitely flavorful and a great option if you like fruity flavors.

Black and White Sundae (~$14): Chocolate and vanilla ice cream with whipped cream, topped with a tuxedo chocolate-covered strawberry. Super delicious, too. The flavors are basic, but it's a great classical twist nonetheless!

I can understand why people would complain about the price, but this place is the home of the freaking $1000 dessert! Why expect anything less than expensive from here? Plus, it's on The Strip! It's a well-known fact that restaurants in Vegas, let alone on The Strip, are pretty costly.

Anyways, I will definitely come here again when I'm in Vegas. But, if you plan on eating sundaes, be sure to have a group of hungry people to share it with! Trust me, there's enough for everyone.",2,2,2

No worries, I made due with what was on the menu and got the donut later on in the week.

Okay, moving on from my story to the review of this restaurant. We came in around 11ish on a Tuesday morning to grab some lunch. We were greeted and seated and looking through the menu. I already knew I was going to get a frozen hot chocolate and I decided to try their ABC burger. This was the avocado, brie and caramelized onion burger...(Can you say YUMMMM!!!). I was a huge burger and I had to break the burger up because it was so huge! I was in love with the bun! It was a one of a kind bun with a very soft texture and sweet taste. I never really thought of ever putting brie on my burger but I guess I will now!!! 

The serve was a hit. Our waitress made sure we were taking care of, was uberly nice and made recommendation. I enjoyed having her as my waitress. 

You would think that from the sound of my review they should be receiving 5 stars but what knocked it down was my donut! So I was happy on tuesday but when I came back friday to get a donut (I am not asking for much....just a big giant donut!) I was welcome by an unfriendlier staff members that didn't really seem to want to help me until I was finally helped by the bartender. Everyone kept telling me to go outside the to go bar to get it but...it was 11:10 and they were still not opened....not cool! Luckily the bartender grab me the donut form the back.  

Overall, depending on the day, the service can be either a hit or a miss. The food was pretty good for me to return. If you're a chocolate lover...go try the frozen hot chocolate!",0,0,0

We told her we had just called like an hour ago and if theres anyone else who would've answered the phone and she asked us ""Do you know who you spoke to?"" and we said ""no.."" and she basically said theres nothing they can do then and that we have to wait.

Finally got a chance to check this place out! There's usually a wait for this place, but you can always choose to sit at the bar. You can order and eat there too. 

We wanted to go all out here. Go big or go home! Here's what we ordered:

+ Amaretto Almond Frozzzzzon Hot Chocolate
+ Fried Oreo Sunday
+ Crabcakes Benedict
+ Fried Eggs Benedict

The crabcakes was soooooooooooo delicious! The fried eggs one wasn't as good. I enjoyed the frozon hot chocolate. It didn't really tastes like hot chocolate, more like the amaretto. It's quite pricey and more of a novelty. I was a little iffy about the fried oreos but they were delicious and it didn't feel too bad eating them. Everything was so sweet. Almost got a toothache here. 

They have a to go window, which is nice if you're not interested in a full sit down meal. 

I was debating between 3-4 stars. It is quite overpriced to dine here, but if you can get vouchers from your hotel or comps from the casino it'll be better. Remember to bring your TR card to discounts. It's a little overrated for the frozen hot chocolate, but the food is yummy.",1,1,1

+ Great outdoor sidewalk cafe with plenty of shade to kill that relentless heat
+ Great people watching for those crossing Caesar's Palace
+ Great for large groups but place can get crowded at peak times. Consider reservations.
+ Plenty of brunch choices which is meal I sat for: chicken and waffles, steak strip sandwich, omelettes, french toast, pancakes bigger than your head and etc.
+ French toast decent. Decadent and huge portions. 
+ Portions are great to be shared. Think massive caloric portions like Cheesecake Factory. Gross! Best to be shared than downed alone.
+ Great home fries.

The -'s:
- Portions are gargantuan! Hello server who served 12 girls. Did you not see we were all petite?? It would have been a better tip for you if you had just suggested that the portions were huge. None of us finished our meals and we can all eat but come on! The food portions were ridiculous and we could have shared. And no we did not know the portions were huge because more none of the patrons are from Vegas!!!!
- We were asked to wait nearly 45 minutes until another server could arrive because our party was too large to serve! And this was after we had called for reservations in advance and were told that we would have no problem being seated at 10am. Get your story straight.
- 10 oz. sirloin steak sandwich for $20. I saw mostly French baguette rather than steak. 
- Frozen hot chocolate. It's just hot chocolate that has sat in the freezer. Or hot chocolate over ice. Not memorable. Pass.",1,0,0

The spinach dip was good but I felt that the spinach dip at  Yard House,Las Vegas, was even better. They could have added more chips to the dish. There was more spinach dip than chips. 
I first went to Serendipity with My cousin in May 09.  They sat us on a table with a leaking hose that dripped water every 5 minutes on our table. The service was horrible because they totally messed up our order and thought we ordered the buffalo wings with bleu cheese, but we ordered the chicken strips with bleu cheese dip on  the side.
Anyways, I have to applaud the frozen hot chocolate! Its my next greatest  sweet pleasure, right next to the Lemon Ice Box Pie at Lois the Pie Queen. !",0,0,0

So, on Saturday night after the CES show we decided to go to Serendipity for dinner and frozen hot chocolate. 
I have to agree with with my co-worker, the foods at Serendipity were delicious specially the Mocha frozen hot chocolate. I had the crab cake salad and my co-worker had the Thai beef salad. Both salads were good and right portion size that save us enough stomach space to enjoy our frozen hot chocolate. 
However, the service was sorta slow, it took then 30 min to serve us the salad that's why I took off one star from the rating.

Upon checking into Caesar's Palace, we couldn't help but notice the large plastic replicas of the Frozen Hot Chocolate and didn't stop wondering about it until we actually had it. It was totally worth the wait. The drink was the best part of the meal.

Maybe the anticipation and the atmosphere of this adorable, doll-house like restaurant influenced the fact that breakfast at Serendipity 3 was my favorite meal while on vacation in Las Vegas. But then again, I'm not a picky eater.

The Central Park Omelette (egg-white omelette with spinach, avocado and swiss cheese) was my first ever egg-white omelette. I don't think I can ever go back to the ""yellow"" omelette... I've been converted. The waffle-cut fries were good too, a bit on the crunchy [not crispy] side, but really good nonetheless. 

My boyfriend ate the Breakfast Steak Sandwich which was made of: NY steak, Sunny Side Up eggs, smoked pepper bacon,  and cheddar and jack cheeses. It was huge... it could have fed both of us. I tasted it and it was really good. But the bread was kind of hard for my liking... and the roof of my mouth.

Other Yelpers complained of bad service but I don't recall reducing the tip at all... but I think the restaurant was semi-new when we visited (in April) so maybe the servers were still ""fresh.""

If you need a sugar fix, they have a take-out window for sweets and drinks... the blue popcorn caught my eye, I think it was Cotton Candy flavored... and it was just what I needed.

If you don't want to eat here at least try the Frozen Hot Chocolate, I highly recommend it, especially to cool off in the Las Vegas desert.",0,0,0

Because we ordered the big drink, we only ordered one dish. That was the Eastside Western omelette. I didn't like it much. The filling was fine, but the eggs were rough and fluffy. I just didn't like the texture. 

I will come back for sure for the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, but I will not have any omelette. I may try the chicken wings with waffle. I saw people ordered that plate. It looked great.

Being that it's Las Vegas' Restaurant Week, I ordered the set meal. For the price of $20.11 for all three courses, it was a bargain (since a breakfast entree by itself averages $15+\/plate).

FIRST COURSE
Chocolaccino (Frothy Cappucino, Fresh Whipped Cream & Shaved French Chocolate):
-For some reason I thought this was a cold drink, similar to that of a Starbucks' Frappucino. I was not expecting this to be a hot drink when the waitress brought it out. Luckily she was kind enough for me to switch it out for the Mixed Berry Smoothie. (Took a few sips of it before sending it back. It was nothing spectacular.)

Mixed Berry Smoothie (Blackberry, Blueberry & Rasberry Blended with Yogurt):
-Lots of seeds from the fruits! So if you dont mind getting a few stuck in between your teeth, then definitely get this. It's a richer version of Jamba Juice. 

SECOND COURSE
Breakfast Quesadilla (Scrambled Eggs, Potatoes & Bacon Quesadilla served with Sour Cream, Guacamole & Pico de Gallo):
-Extremely hearty! There are big wedges of potato in the quesadilla itself. Very tasty!

THIRD COURSE
Cheesecake Lollipop & Frrrozen Hot Chocolate Shot (Sample Shot of Serendipity's Trademark Frrrozen Hot Chocolate & Cheesecake Lollipop):
-Dessert presentation, the desserts were decoratively served on a white plate with chocolate syrup and sprinkles. 
-The Cheesecake Lollipop, meh. I didnt think it was that great. It was soft cheesecake on the inside, with a coating of chocolate and crushed pistachios on the outside. This dessert actually tasty rather salty, when I was expecting it to be sweet.
-The Frrrozen Hot Chocolate tastes exactly like the name. Imagine hot chocolate, except served cold.

You are not Serendipity's target demographic.  There's not much of a bar and you won't find Sportscenter on any TV.  You are at Serendipity because your wife\/girlfriend\/girl-you-want-to-impress dragged you out here.  Just resign yourself to the fact that you will be dining in a big, pink restaurant and you may actually enjoy yourself.  That being said, the food is actually quite good, if you can get over the cutesy dish names (Spinny Dip vs. Spinach Dip).

Aside from the menu, you'll find very few similarities between Serendipity Las Vegas and Serendipity New York.  The NY location is small little cozy restaurant tucked away on a side street in the middle of a big city.  It's been made famous by the John Cusack movie of the same name and guest appearances on Sex and the City. The Las Vegas location is smack dab in the middle of the brightest, tackiest, loudest spot on the Las Vegas strip.  When I say it's on the Las Vegas Strip, it's literally on the strip.  If you spill your drink while dining on one of the patio tables, you'll most likely hit a tourist walking by.  The Vegas location is large and open.  It loses a lot of the intimate atmosphere of the original Serendipity.

The food is surprisingly good.  It's typical American food, except with a cute, girly name and a not-so-cute price tag.  You've got a large selection of sandwiches and burgers, and a smaller selection of pizzas, pastas, and salads.  But you're not here for the entrees.  You're here for the Frozen Hot Chocolate.  Well, maybe not you, but your female dining companion certainly is.  It's chocolate, it's sweet, it's cute, and it's really expensive.  It's what every girl loves, wrapped up in a delicious calorie-laden dessert.

I'm going to reserve judgement on their service as they just opened up a few days ago.  We made reservations the day before we arrived but when we got there, we were told that the reservation system doesn't work and they don't get any updates.  We had to wait an additional 30 minutes for our seat.  We requested an indoor table but got a patio table instead.  Weather was mild but just a tad chilly so the restaurant had some gas-powered heaters going.  Unfortunately, the heaters were brand-spanking new and created a noxious odor that burned your nostrils and made your eyes water.  We requested that the burner next to us be turned off, but there was nothing we could do about the burners upwind from us.  The table there liked the heat.  There were two parties that sat next to us who left because they couldn't stand the fumes emanating from the heaters.  We were starving so we sat through the smell.

Pros: Great location on the strip - excellent view.  Wide variety of food.  Surprisingly edible.
Cons: Pricey ($8 for a small bowl of chili, $20 for a sandwich), spotty service
Suggested attire: Guys - United Colors of Benetton, Girls - tight leggings

It's always been a dream of mine to try Serendipity after seeing the movie One Fine Day with Michelle Phiefer and George Clooney! 

Serendipity was one of our stops during aggressive lounging and we were looking forward to having something nice and cold after walking the strip. I was drawn to the patio as it looked so cute from afar. However, upon entering from the inside, I noticed that many tables were not cleared and had plates and melting IceCream left unattended. The line to sit inside was lengthy so we chose to sit at the bar on the patio. 

I ordered the infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate and my guest ordered an Oreo Milk Shake. The milkshake was thick and malty! The frozen hot chocolate was everything I expected it to be and I didn't have an ounce of remorse after indulging in all of the whipped cream they topped it with! 

On average, including tip, the bill was $30. Yes, Vegas Strip prices will get ya! The reason I give this review only 3 stars isn't bc of poor service or poor desserts, it's because of the lack of cleanliness. Sticky floors, sticky tables, sticky counter top. This place needed a deep clean! None the less glad I can finally cross off a frozen hot coco from my bucket list! If I ever come back and I want to splurge, I just might get the $1000 Golden Sundae that is served in golden mallet, sprinkled with edible gold, given a golden spoon, uses the rarest vanilla bean, given a scoop of Tahitian Vanilla Ice cream, and I really don't have to explain the rest!

There's usually a minimum of a 25 minute wait for a table (longer if it's busy).  People come here for the name and for their ""Frrrozen Hot Chocolate,"" which costs $15 (large).  If you're looking for a novelty restaurant or place where all the hype is at, this place is it.  But expect nothing more.

RECOMMENDATIONS \/ TIPS:  It's best to go during off-peak hours (i.e., afternoon).  Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is great to try (it does taste great), but it's difficult to justify the $15 price tag.  ALSO, they (supposedly) charge a $4 sharing fee.  We were able to avoid it because we purchased 3 Frrrozen Hot Chocolate (practically entrée prices in and of itself).  Their sweet potato fries are good!

DETAILS - DETAILS - DETAILS:
-----------------------------------------------
Atmosphere:
It's just one dining room and no waiting area; so if you're sitting next by the entrance, expect to feel the weather outside and perhaps someone standing over your shoulders as you eat.  The best way to describe the décor is: wacky, eccentric, random, and maybe even a little bit nostalgic as they try to bring in some of that old-fashioned diner feel.

Service:
The wait here can be long at times.  Even during off-peak hours (e.g., 3:00pm) the wait can be 15 minutes for a party of 2-4 and 30 minutes for 5-8.  Service began slow (waited 10 minutes for our order to be taken), but picked up after our order was submitted.  On an irritated note, our waitress tried to nickel and dime us with three $4 sharing fees (we ordered 5 entrées for 8 people), then claimed that she was being nice because she was supposed to charge the $4 sharing fee for all 8 of us (yes, making that $32; is she out of her mind??).  After we exuded our frustration with the matter and indicated that we had ordered 3 of their $15 Frrrozen Hot Chocolates, she decided to be nice and ""take care it.""  C'mon lady... we weren't born yesterday.

Food Quality \/ Selection:
The food here is mediocre.  Their burger is big, but nothing spectacular.  We also had a sirloin steak sandwich on a large baguette.  Overall, the portions are on the bigger side and you're sure to get filled because most of the food they serve are heavy.  Presentation is average as well.  Take a look at their menu here: http:\/\/www.serendipity3.com\/food.htm. 

Pricing\/Value\/Convenience:
Overall, I would say that this restaurant has poor value given the price they charge for the quality of the food, the type of food they serve, their overall service, and the crowded (almost cafeteria\/fast food-like) atmosphere.  It's okay if you're here just to check it out, but I could recommend many better restaurants to go to.  It's centrally located right on the Strip, so just valet your car at Caesar's Palace and walk on over!",1,0,0

More specifically, that time has come because people are sick of hearing me talk about places and what I thought of them in real life. So: off to the internet!

There's no better place to cut my reviewing teeth on than Serendipity3. There's good! There's bad! There's drama and intrigu-- truthfully, there's not much intrigue.

The thing that gets me the most about Serendipity3 is that there is just so much *potential*, but, man, potential's hard to live up to, right? The food is more than serviceable, but just shy of great. We went this past weekend and were informed that they'd started a seasonal menu, which means the things that transcend, individually, to great, might not be available. In my opinion, one of those dishes is the ~*Mac & Cheese Pizza*~ (the punctuation shows you how highly I regard it). This is apparently now a ""winter"" food, so look out if you'd like it in, oh, say, May. That said, this most recent trip, our waitress, a woman named Phoenix, went the extra mile in making sure I got what I came for (ifyouknowwhatimean). 

My dining companion (so fancy when you say it that way! It's really just my boyfriend Al, but if I can't be fancy on the internet, I can't be fancy anywhere) ordered one of the seasonal items, a sandwich called A Summer Bries, with turkey, brie, apples, cranberry mayo on raisin pumpernickel bread. Because Al has resigned himself to a lot of things in our relationship, I eventually ended up with some of that sandwich. And here's the thing: it was a good sandwich, but for a restaurant where we dropped $80 on a meal at 4 p.m., it wasn't what it could've been. 

The accompanying waffle fries (because sweet potato fries are for people who hate freedom) were like if Arby's curly fries and Chick-Fil-A's waffle fries had a baby, but also in that baby was some gourmet blood, like from a grandparent, so that they didn't immediately remind you of a drive thru and oil-soaked cardboard. Let's be clear: that means they were DELICIOUS.

We got the requisite frozen hot chocolate, which has either a.) shrunk or b.) we ordered, on accident, an individual one. I was still trying to get Phoenix at the time it came out, so I didn't want to ask. It was good, it always is. But is it as good as the amount of money it cost? I think that probably depends on several factors, like the temperature outside, the time of year, and whether I'd won $20 on penny slots in Caesars. Your factors probably vary, especially if you're, like, allergic to chocolate or you'd rather spend the money on booze. Doing the frozen hot chocolate and alcohol and pop easily bumps your bill up to the next price point.

This past trip was also our first time sitting on the patio, mostly because it's always so busy and we never wanted to wait. The patio is nice, and, for someone who gets sudden and random fits of why-are-all-these-people-so-damn-close-to-me?!, like myself, it gives you a little bit more space around you. The inside can sometimes feel like you're right on top of the table next to you, which: imagine how awful that could be for a Cavs fan seated next to a bunch of people in Garnett jerseys.

Phoenix was, far and away, our best waitress (or waiter!) ever. The service there can get a little slow, especially in really, really busy times (but since they're always really, really busy, this is pretty much a constant) and on last year's birthday trip, we waited 45 minutes for food without any sort of acknowledgment from management OR our waiter. I was in a pretty easygoing mood that trip, but I can imagine that happening on a different day and the rage blackout that may have followed.

The last thing I think worth mentioning is: KIDS. This is the perfect restaurant for parents looking to throw down just a little coin for something vaguely fancy, but not at the risk of getting glares from a hundred stuffy, be-blazered diners. Where you fall on that is obviously your call. On our most recent trip, I watched a boy squirm so much his chair fell over and then he cried for the next five minutes, but I also watched a baby happily blow spit bubbles in a way that made me want to sing songs about rainbows while skipping through a meadow. My heart was that light.",4,5,5

It's right off the strip, in front of Caesars Forums called Serendipity 3. They are known for their signature Frozen Hot Chocolate. My friend and I had the Alfredo pasta and macaroni and cheese. At first we were like ""this is amazing!"". That was only because we were hungry, after the first few bites we realized the food was okay and not that great. Prices were pricey and it seems like the food is large portioned. My mac & cheese didn't seem so big but when I realized when I was done eating, I still had enough to feed another person. Prices average between $14.00 to $1,000.00 (if you decide to get one of their Golden Opulence Sundaes). I wasn't going to let my disappointing dinner get to me! I was there for their Frozen Hot Chocolate. It's about $9.00 and for the double frozen hot chocolate, I think it's about $11.00. My friend and I shared the regular frozen hot chocolate. Was I disappointed? Actually no! It tastes just like what it's called. If you ever had hot chocolate, its just like that, but served cold with thin ice chips in it, sooooo yummy.

Grabbed lunch here with my girlfriends (that one weekend in Vegas) and we never felt so girly! The staff is friendly and pretty attentive. Make sure to have reservations as it can get full pretty fast. We had reservations at 1:30pm and were seated immediately. The food was pretty good, just basic and traditional ""American"" food with a mixture of items you'd find at Cheesecake Factory. The main reason for our late lunch was to get the frozen hot chocolate! This is their main attraction, similar to the movie. The Frozen Hot Chocolate was amazing! Just the right amount of chocolate, whip cream, hot chocolate, frozen chocolate, and topped with chocolate chips! It's a chocolate overload. You have the option of individual frozen hot chocolate ($12.00) or shared frozen hot chocolate ($15.00-presentaiton is so adorbs!).

The portions were HUGE and everything was so delicious! 

I've been to the restaurant in NY and I have to say, while I had a great time at the Vegas location, the NY location is the real deal. It's much, much better. It just has a totally different vibe. The Vegas location is wide and open and air-y. The NY location is super tiny and cramped with strange antique decor. Vegas just feels like a regular restaurant while NY feels like you're stepping into a secret world...I don't quite know how to describe it. 

Plus, NY gets props for having MUCH bigger Frrrrozen hot chocolates. Vegas' was so tiny in comparison! I could finish it in one sip! (I didn't because that'd be horribly embarrassing, but I COULD have and that's what matters, right?...RIGHT?)

We got:

Choose your own omelette (Spinach, Artichokes, Prosciutto, and Brie): Huge. Tasty, but I felt that it needed more flavoring so I added a lot of salt...I'm partly to blame though because I did choose all the ingredients myself haha. The side of breakfast potatoes was SO good, perfectly seasoned!

Las Vegas Strip steak sandwich: MASSIVE. My boyfriend eats a LOT of food and he couldn't even finish it! He had to cut it in half. He says it was delicious though. 

Caesar Salad: Super good. I was really impressed. Not too much dressing, good portion, and the chicken was perfectly seasoned as well. 

Side of Berries: Good portion of berries for what you pay (strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries). It's a bit weird that it's garnished with limp green lettuce though.

Peanut Butter Frrrrrozen Hot Chocolate: my favorite flavor of frrrozen hot chocolate. Not enough peanut butter this time around and, as mentioned earlier, not nearly as big as NY's.

Mimosas: Tasty, but standard fare. Served with a raspberry.

Overall, very good experience. I will say though that since we were VIP we didn't have to wait, but they told us that the wait would have been around 45 minutes (at 11:45ish) if we weren't. Also, we had fantastic service, but the table next to us had to beg for a waitress to even come visit them once and they looked like they were getting progressively more and more ""over it"" as the meal went on (I would have too). So, moral of the story: be VIP wherever you go, I guess? Haha.",4,2,3

Cleanlyness: 5

Service: 3\/5 we wait for 10 minutes for the waiter to come around. we wait another 20-30 min for the food.  Granted, we came at lunch time, but the waiters are busy. the waiting time for a table is 45 min to 1 hour.

It's a few dollars more but after all the effort you've put into getting there (to Serendipity AND to Vegas) I think you'd deserve it! 

It's heaven in an overflowing glass, and so good that when the waiter isn't looking you will surreptitiously take your straw from the glass and stick it into the plate to suck up the overflow.  Don't worry, everyone does it. The main difference between the regular one and the Double is the much more chocolate-y taste in the Double, I think it even has dark chocolate in it. 

The Broadway Sundae is also a must-try, it's the most decadent sundae I've ever had and almost better than the Double Frrrozen Hot Chocolate!  So delicious, we actually considered going back for more the very next day.   Thank God I'm a local.

The food wasn't bad - my bacon burger was decent, as was my wife's triple decker grilled cheese (with variety of cheeses). Both tasty (not amazing), without being worth anywhere close to the hefty price tag.

Where Serendipity 3 fell apart for me was in the atmosphere. The place is tiny, overcrowded and the wait staff are impatient, harried and DO NOT LISTEN. I tried to explain something specific that I wanted and our waitress seemed to be on complete autopilot as she tried to finish my thought for me without having any idea what I was talking about. Eventually I just gave up and hoped for the best (I didn't get what I had asked for).  Wife's Grilled Cheese was supposed to come with soup and a choice of chips or fries. Waitress insisted she couldn't have both, despite the menu clearly listing soup as coming with the grilled cheese (most likely so they can justify their price for what is, after all, just a grilled cheese) by default and an ""all burgers and sandwiches are served with chips or fries"" note at the top of the section.

The night before I had frozen hot chocolate, chilli cheese dog with sauerkraut, and a jalapeño-bacon pretzel. At the time, all of them were solid five and six stars. Unfortunately, now that I'm back with a clear mind, and a six star rating only exists through inebriated eyes, the frozen hot choco and chilli cheese dog were just ordinary.

The frozen hot chocolate was wasted the second time when I realized it was just a chocolate shake topped with hot cocoa powder. The chili cheese dog, although a decent foot long, was your normal chilli cheese dog. 

On the bright side, I did have a winner with the jalapeño-bacon pretzel. I don't like pretzels, but in this type of combination that was served with a side bacon horseradish, I can eat them all day.

We decided to start with a frozen hot chocolate, then have a late lunch and take the carrot cake to go. The frozen hot chocolate was more for him than me, and as I suspected, I wasn't a fan. 

He chose the cookies and cream flavor. It was big and covered in whipped cream, but too syrupy sweet and water-y for me, but he enjoyed it, though he probably wouldn't order it again. Worth experiencing once, though! 

The star of the show for me was the mac and cheese, which was decadent and perfectly seasoned. He went with a turkey club sandwich which was surprisingly tasty and gigantic (the portion sizes make the pricing pretty reasonable for the strip, in my opinion) and so between the two of us we had a really satisfying meal. I had to resist nabbing most of his fries. 

Then, the waitress brought us our to go cake and I nearly fell out of my chair. It was a HUGE slab of cake, with lots of thin layers and plenty of cream cheese frosting. I was still chipping away at it three days later and I'm a big eater. In the end, I didn't even finish the whole thing. If I was to do it again, I'd go with the sundae version, mixing cake and vanilla ice cream and eat it there. 

My only real disappointment was in the decor, I expected it to be cuter inside, but it appeared they were doing a remodel and also, I'm pretty snobby about that sort of thing. I also wasn't too keen on the scratched, cloudy looking plastic water glasses, but again, I'm pretty picky about details.

We visited for breakfast. Ordered a Reese's peanut butter waffle and wagyu Benedict and a frozen hot chocolate. With exception to the Benedict all items individually were more then enough for one person.

Inside the two waffles was a light stuffed bacon topped along with peanut butter, whipped cream, and caramel sauce. A side of warm syrup is provided to add sweetness. The pancakes were overly filling and properly sweet.

The Benedict sliders were requested on the side of medium. Wagyu was a bit on the well side and over seasoned. Paired into a biscuit and bacon. Eggs were appropriately cooked. The hollandaise sauce was seasoned nicely. 

The frozen hot chocolate, what they are known for.  The small is appropriate for a small group not eating a meal. The large is more than too much for a group eating a meal. We ordered a small mint frozen hot chocolate. Comes in various flavors. 
House made a mistake and delivered us a large one (charged for the small one ordered). Drink was delicious. Just too much volume after consuming the meal.

Check and bill settlement were quick. Reviewing the price for the portions I would say this was a good value. If you have a Total Rewards card you can save some more money on menu items across.

Bad: little off on cooking but not lost on taste.

Well first of all, I don't really have a big sweet tooth. I always say ""no"" to desserts and I think therefore am fortunate enough to never have braces *knock on wood*. So when I say that the frozen hot chocolate ($9 for the small) was actually pretty good, that must mean it is heaven to those dessert lovers. The chocolate chip flakes were so yummy with the whipped cream and cold ""hot chocolate"" flavor.

I also had big expectations for this place given that it's so popular, so giving 4 stars after those expectations mean that they have pretty much met them. The dessert was good, and even ""The 'Hangover'"" omelette I had was delicious. French fries, cheese, and mushrooms in an omelette? Consider my hangover cured!! I added onions which they charged an extra $1.00. I thought even the potato wedges were really good and well seasoned. But one thing I gotta mention... it was HUMONGOUS! I couldn't even finish half. I know I'm a small girl but my guy friend said he couldn't even finish it. This was about $12 so that's pretty good considering the huge portion.

My friend had the fried egg benedict, which I didn't really like so much. I thought it had a weird taste, but my friend said it was ok. He thought it was really small at first, given only two pieces: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=_LMf6cTfbNqv6zSn6nUY6g#b4-wUWO8-XQgzuklUl7V3Q. But those biscuits are heavy and sauce is so rich that he got full and couldn't help me finish my giant omelette when he said he would damnit haha. Oh well, had lunch the next day figured out! =P

The wait was an hour for two people, so I suggest walking to Caesar's Palace and grabbing a Fat Tuesday while you're waiting which was what we did :) 

and PS. if you order the frozen hot chocolate with your meals, the dessert comes first. So if you want it later, order it after you get your food!

This place is a novelty. If you're a fan of delicious, over the top desserts, do come by and indulge!

Th frozen hot chocolate is pretty good, hints of cocoa and nicely whipped, and big enough to share with two people.

There is a food menu as well featuring hamburgers, hot dogs, fried chicken etc...your real American type of fare.

I only gave this place a 4 star only because I didn't think the food ""WOW'd"" me.

Though the food was delicious and cooked to my liking (I had the blue burger), I just felt like I was eating at a regular Applebee's\/Red Robin sort of place.

I did love the sweet potato fries with the dusting of sweetness (I'm guessing a cinnamon\/sugar mixture)

The customer service is friendly and so is the atmosphere.

I would recommend this place to friends if they're looking for something whimsical to hangout at.

If you're going to see Absynthe, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, etc., consider coming here for some drinks and a bite to eat - but don't expect mind blowing hotdogs, burgers or that ""Change your life"" entree. Food is simply good and desserts are always amazing!

Several times I attempted to try it and my plans never went through. It happened so often that trying this thing became an item on my bucket list. Finally ordered the large size for two people to share with my friend. As soon as we took a sip she and I looked at each other right away and made a face. Something was really off in it. There was a strong lingering aftertaste of spoiled milk. I didn't react right away because I wasn't sure if maybe that was an intentional taste although my friend felt the same way. After a few more sips I had to tell the waitress it just wasn't drinkable. She assured me they went through milk so quickly it couldn't be spoiled and offered to have it remade. It made sense that a place like this couldn't serve spoiled milk, so I agreed to try again and have it remade. This time someone who I believe was part of management brought it out. But even after the second time that after taste was still there. I tried to ignore it and tell myself maybe it's just an acquired taste, but it was just not drinkable. We ended up just leaving the thing. $20 down the drain. I know I'm pretty good at detecting bad milk, but I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. But the car ride home confirmed my suspicions when my stomach started cramping. I wish the waitress or management would have tried it to be sure it wasn't spoiled. I know it sounds unlikely for milk to be spoiled but things can happen (bad shipment maybe) and it would have been nice if someone looked into it first or tasted it before dismissing it as something that could never happen. Very disappointing. The money, the time, the expectations... All down the drain. The waitress was otherwise very nice and the nachos were good, thus the extra star. :\/",0,0,0

No big deal since I was just people watching and enjoying the weather.  After another 15 minutes of waiting at window #2 a delicious ice cream appeared.  I will give them credit for a yummy ice cream sundae.

Round two was the same routine of waiting with a crowd that was becoming restless and angry for over 30 minutes.  This time when my ice cream sundae finally appeared it had the wrong flavor ice cream.  I had ordered vanilla and it was chocolate.  No biggie, who doesn't like chocolate?  Then I discovered it was all melted and ruined.  Threw it in the trash (after eating the whipped cream off of course).  No way I could have gotten through the angry mob to ask for a replacement.  The price of a sundae is $10.00.  Geez, I'm a sucker right?  I plan to write Caesar's Palace and ask for a $10.00 credit.  I love the Qua Waters Spa and I think that's where I would use the credit.

I normally do not mind the wait for popular restaurants, but the ladies who are in charge of the line are horrible at giving approximate wait times and they don't accommodate for everyone who is waiting to get placed on the waiting list. There were a handful of people who were ignored... who ended up leaving because of the horrible service they're getting (and they didn't even sit down yet!). We waited quite a long time to get seated, but our server was pretty helpful in helping us choose what to order. We decided to share the Don't Drop Your Skirt Steak Frites. It looks really fancy, but it didn't taste as fancy as it looked.

We also ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate that everyone orders when they go to Serendipity. Now, I'm not a huge fan of chocolate, but I do enjoy hot chocolate.

My girlfriend and I checked out Serendipity 3 for dinner on a busy Sat night in Sin City. The location is out of the way, so you either have to walk though Ceaser's or the Bellagio to get there because there is no direct parking. 
We first encountered a girl outside at the check in booth after a short wait. We told her we were just a party of 2 and she said it would be 20-35mins for seating indoors, and about 20mins for outdoor seating. We took the buzzer thing to wait for indoor seating and I asked if there was a bar inside we could wait at, and she told us it was right inside. As we walked up to the bar, I noticed napkins, silverware, and condiments strewn across the bar, inclining me to ask the bartender if we could eat at the bar (which was empty with 8 stools!), he told us definitely. So proceeded to return to the booth girl and hand her back the buzzer and told her she should let people know that bar seating is an option with no wait.
Once seated, we took a look at the eclectic menu and decided on the Dino Ribs for me, and the Chicken Alfredo for my girl. As we were waiting for our food, two more couples came to the bar with their buzzers and realized there was seating and returned the buzzer, lol. 
It took about 20 mins for our food to arrive, a lil too long I think for what we ordered. As we waited, the bartender basically had zero personality and only asked for our drink orders and then pretty much ignored us until we had to pay. 
The Dino Ribs were three huge ribs that was a good portion size for the $20 price tag, and the Chicken Alfredo was probably 3lbs of pasta! The only real problem with the food though, is that it's not knock your socks off good. For the prices they charge for simple items, I expected to be blown away, and that definitely was not the case. It seemed to me, the real reason to visit Serendipity 3 is for the desserts, they're huge and extravagant, they even have a $1,000 dish! We actually didn't opt for dessert because of our lackluster experience. If I ever go back, it'll be strictly to try the dessert, maybe they can wow me then, otherwise, there are much better options on the Strip than Serendipity 3.",2,2,2

Half of the lettuce was old\/wilted, the cherry tomatoes were overripe, and the pizza was just a joke, because they put the cheese on top of something that was not a pizza crust!

I have always wanted to go to Serendipity, but never had the chance until we went to Vegas recently.  I also had a Groupon  - they have NO idea what to do with a Groupon!

We went into the restaurant and were told it was a 40 minute wait, even though the restaurant was mostly empty.  The hostess was not friendly at all.  We asked if we could use our Groupon outside at the take away place, and we were told we could.  We then went outside and waited in the hot sun for 25 minutes - slowest moving line ever!!  Finally got to the front only to be told that we can't use our Groupon there.  I asked nicely if she could kindly help up get a faster reservation inside, as we'd been given the run around, which she kindly did.

We spoke to a very nice female manager inside who said that it was her fault, she had told her hostess the wrong info, so she would take care of us.  We asked if we could  get the menu from outside, as we had waited already and had made up our minds what to order.  She let us know she'd take care of it.

Then, out of nowhere, some horrible male manager came out and said he'd seat us, but we'd have to pay the prices inside (which were WAY higher), and he even scolded the female manager in front of us.  Horrible, horrible, horrible!  My husband got frustrated and let out a sound of frustration because we'd been so screwed around with and the male manager had the balls to actually threaten to call security...really???  YOU screw up, we show the tiniest bit of frustration, and THAT""S how you treat us?  But then again, the way he treated the other manager was pretty atrocious, so I shouldn't be surprised.  

We were helped by the fabulous bartender, to whom we apologized that she had to deal with their mess.  We placed our order and after quite some time, finally got our food to take outside.  I had questioned some of the pricing, as not all of it had been changed.  We ended up getting overcharged $4, then another few dollars because we ordered a bacon cheeseburger, but guess what was missing???  The bacon.  Frustrated that we told the bartender that and she didn't offer to give us our $ back (esp. as we had given her a 40% tip, kind of by accident, but still).  NOT Impressed and will never go back.  The New York stores should be ashamed to be associated with this horrible place.",1,0,0

We sat inside because the wait was shorter but they do have outdoor seating.  

We shared dinner. I ordered the Fetuccini Alfredo, I guess you could say I was seeking some comfort food and OMG it was so wonderful, honestly every buttery bite was to die for. Portion was huge but so was my appetite, came with a toasted baguette-with more butter.   

Kids ordered hot dogs and foot-long gigantic dogs came out-so they can share. 

We topped off our dinner with their famous dessert. You must order it, it's the only reason to come here right? The Frozen Chocolate was so delectable, honestly it was so yummy-not overly sweet, it was just right for the four of us.  

Overall we had great service and a little stand with some souvenirs was next to the register so we purchased some frozen chocolate packets to-go for the kids.

We decided on a more of a dessert kind of feel dinner, and so we decided on a place called Serendipity 3. Located right off the strip in front of Caesars, it definitely wasn't an easy restaurant to access. As soon as we were seated our waiter just dropped off menus without saying one word and let us be. After what seemed like an eternity, the waiter finally came back and asked us if we were ready to order. I then immediately asked if I can get the restaurant week menu. The waiter then replied saying that there were no specials that he was aware of. I literally busted out my phone and showed him that Serendipity 3 was a part of restaurant week and showed him the specials. He then left and asked one of his fellow colleagues that acknowledged that they did have a restaurant week menu. So the waiter comes by and finally acknowledges that there was a special menu, without any sort of an apology. He took our order and then left. I'm a very patient person when it comes to bad service. What I mean is I have taken a lot of crap without complaining, but this guy was just the worst. First of all he was very soft spoken, and had a very bad attitude problem. What's the first rule of working in the service industry? Leave your problems at the door, and put a smile on your face. This guy definitely needed a lesson in service. Anyways, after all the rude remarks and attitude he gave us while ordering, our food finally came out. Before our food even came out, I noticed the waiter just went around and asked everyone else how they were doing, and completely ignored us. I was without a drink for 15 plus minutes, and did I mention the food came out very slow. I can tell it wasn't the cooks fault, it was our waiter. My chicken dish I've ordered was cold to the core; not even a little feel of warmth. I just let it slide and finished my dinner. The most anticipated part of the meal finally came out, dessert. I've noticed that he has gotten our order wrong, and then informed him of his mistake. Once again without any apology he just takes the plate without a word. I can see his facial expression of disgust as he walked away. The nerves of this guy were incredible! To make the story short, we enjoyed our dessert very much.  Needless to say our waiter never came back after correcting his mistake. My friends and I sat there socializing for a long period of time.  All I can hear is the slurps from the straw, since the drinks were empty. Honestly I just wanted the check so we can leave, but our waiter was nowhere to be found.  When I finally saw our waiter, I politely tried to gain his attention. He totally just ignored me and walked on by. Finally I went up to the front and asked if I could get my check, and the hostess instructed us to ask our waiter. At this point I was furious and asked for a manager. The manager was very nice and offered us a complimentary lunch on them. One thing I believe the manager made a mistake was when he said, ""Yeah, we get complaints on him all the time."" When I heard that, in my head I was like, ""Then why is he still working here!?"" Thanks to that rude waiter, I will never go back to Serendipity again. I even have a complimentary meal, but no thanks!",2,0,0

but from the few things that i was fortunate enough to try here, it sure seems that way.

prices are very decent for the portion sizes! everything is usually under 20 dollars but is big enough for two people to definitely share. 

i for one love the hangover omelet i think it is. its like 10 dollars about, comes with seasoned potato wedges on the side. it is the best omelet i have ever had! i mean, it comes with french fries INSIDE of it! what??? who does that! GOD does. i am pretty sure God cooks french fries into his omelets. definitely recommend if your an omelet eater.

the other thing i was completely surprised by was the strawberry waffles...they were so good i want to cry! they come with freshly made whipped cream, strawberries, and syrup(which i didn't even need they were so perfectly sweet already) i mean, i don't even LIKE waffles and i'm telling you to try them. you will not be disappointed unless are the type of person that doesn't like sweet and creamy perfectly combined and sprinkled with unicorn sparkles.....but hey, its not for everyone.

another good thing, frozen hot chocolate. i've had plain, peanutbutter, and mint chocolate! all have been to die for. i really don't need to say more. just buy it.

i also had their strawberry banana smoothie which was even better than my favorite smoothie from jamba juice...sorry jamba. it was only the one time i swear!

best thing about sprinkles was the service! first time i went there, i was really impressed. our food took a little longer to come out than we thought it should but we didn't even say anything about it, our waitress just came over and apologized and when it came time to order the frozen hot chocolates, we were debating between two of them so she brought out both and comped one because of the wait. very nicely done!",2,0,0

I swear I did a review on this place since I went here the FIRST time I was in Vegas, weeeeeiiirrrd. Anyways, this review is LONG overdue.

Went here with my wifey because I raved about their ever-so-famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. We were in Vegas for 3 days & went here twice. FYI; they text you when your table is ready which I thought was really cool & an option that most restaurants should use.

The first time we sat inside. I ordered the White House Pizza whicvh is a sauceless white pie with ricotta, mozzerlla and parmasean, topped with fresh basil & truffle oil. (gave up meat for Lent otherwise I would've totally tried out the Smoked Chicken Quesadilla *drools) It was actually more flavorful than I thought it would be. I'd recommend it :)

The second time my friend just wanted to get the Frozen Hot Chocolate to satisfy her craving so we opted for the walk-up window just outside the sit-down restaurant. WARNING: the line is ALWAYS long. But we decided to brave the line & go for it. But just our luck as soon as we're at the front of the line the computer system decides to crash. We stood there for literally 30 mins which wasn't bad because the guy at the front window provided us with a complimentary Frozen Hot Chocolate while we waited. SUPER nice of him :) since I know that the people behind us didn't get the same benefit ;)

The selection of their menu is absolutely crazy! Just the variety as far as the Hot Chocolate goes, HOLY CRAP. If you're an indecisive person, GOOD LUCK GOOD SIR. lol, but really... I could literally go to Vegas 100 more time & not try EVERY, SINGLE thing on their menu. I'm just sayin'",5,2,2

Like many Vegas locals, I avoid The Strip whenever possible. A few people at my work were headed to Caesar's Palace's Cheesecake Factory when someone suggested we try Serendipity 3 instead. Because we were on The Strip, I knew that we would be treated like tourists and pay tourists prices. No shocker there:-) 

I was pleasantly surprised that our group was seated right away in their patio area. Our waiter was pleasant and even joked around with us a bit. He was quick with drink orders and recommendations on the menu. 

The menu was extensive. There were plenty of food options as well as a ton of choices for desserts. We were there for dinner, and I wasn't feeling all that hungry, and I asked the waiter what he'd recommend; he stated that The Vegas Dog was one of his favorite items. I went with that. 

The Vegas Dog is a foot-long hotdog with nacho cheese and jalapeños. When the dog came out, I was surprised by the awkward shape of the dish that seemed to reach the middle of the table and disturb my fellow diners. This thing is so massive that picking it up and eating it with your hands would have been challenging! I forked and knifed it. The bun to meat ratio was way off. Towards the middle of the meal, I got sick of how much bread there was and decided to eat just the dog from there on out. Although the meat was cooked thoroughly and there was a good amount of cheese on top, I couldn't get over the canned jalapeños. There were only a few slices of jalapeños, and it was surprised to learn that for $17 you weren't getting a freshly chopped topping. The taste of the peppers was mild and soggy. Also, the meat isn't flavored well. Besides the shear size of the dog, it tasted like any basic-brand hotdog you can find in your local grocery store. I would stick to Hebrew National or even BallPark Franks if you want some flavor in the meat. 

As a local, I was glad to have good service at a tourist restaurant, but if I do return to this place, I'll be sure to stick with ice cream.",2,0,0

The fare is very typical American\/Italian fare - pizza, pasta, burgers, etc. Their signature seems to be the frozen hot chocolate. The frozen hot chocolate was large and tasty but it was a rather hefty $13 for one.

The wagyu sliders were a bit dry. The creamy tomato soup was in fact rather chunky. It was good but definitely not worth the $9 or whatever it was that we paid.

We mentioned we were Diamond Club members and supposedly our wait was reduced to half the time but we still waited a good 30-40 minutes for our party of 4 to be seated for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Still, I will take that compared to the hour and half plus waits I've seen here in the past. I gotta say being hungry and watching the other parties food come out as we were waiting for a table was a really big tease. 
Of course, I had to try their world famous frozen hot chocolate. It was about 105 outside the day we were there so I was especially looking forward to it. I didn't realize that it came in 2 sizes, one a smaller one seemingly meant for one person and a larger one to be shared with several people. Good to know you don't have to get the gigantic one if you just want to try it. I gotta say my expectations were pretty low on it. I just expected a slightly sweeter than normal frappucino. Perhaps because my expectations were so low, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Sweet chocolaty goodness but doesn't quite cross the threshold of too sweet. I wouldn't say its one my favorite desserts ever but definitely worth trying if you are a chocolate lover like me. 
As far as the rest of the food, we all had a hard time deciding since everything on the menu sounded really good and looked really good as it was being brought out to the other tables. I was surprised that the menu did look that good since as I had mentioned in a previous review, all I saw people eating before was prepackaged salads. Well that must have been from the takeout menu because the restaurant food looked much more desirable. I ended up getting the summer brie turkey sandwich and everyone else got burgers. I thought my sandwich as well as the accompanying sweet potato fries (again...they are everywhere now!) were really good. But melted brie on almost anything is bound to be good. Everyone was pretty happy with their burgers as well. 
Why the 3 star rating then? First, the service was pretty bad. Very slow and almost rude at times. Unfortunately, I can't remember any specific incidents but I know all of us were pretty unhappy with the service we received. 
Second, this spot has arguably the best location on the Vegas strip. Unfortunately, the facilities are not built to accommodate the traffic it receives. The location the way its set up would be prefect if perhaps it was tucked away in the back of a casino. But being right on the center of the strip at one of the busiest hotels- no way! The small and quaint feel as well as the always ridiculous wait just doesn't work for me. It just seems too contrived. Too bad they don't have another more low key location in Vegas. The food was good enough for me to go again. Too  bad the rest of the experience didn't make up for it.",0,0,0

My dog could make better meatballs than I've had at this place. I couldn't tell if the indigestion I had afterwards was from the dry meatballs and bland, overcooked pasta, or the belligerent waitress that we had. The list of grievances that I have against our waitress is long (includes rolling her eyes, cutting us off while we were speaking to her). I get it, we all have bad days once in a while...but this went beyond just a bad day. I can honestly say that it was the worst service I've ever had, and the first time I've genuinely been upset over a meal out. When we eventually asked to speak to the manager, our waitress refused to tell us where he was and walked off. We eventually did speak to the manager, who was extremely apologetic, but the damage was already done at that point. 

The only thing this place has going for it is its marketing. Not even the frozen hot chocolate is that great. Make yourself some chocolate milk, blend it with some ice, and save your money.

We also ordered a slice of the cheesecake creme de la creme.

The Frozen Hot Chocolate was good - it didn't blow my mind but it was packed with chocolate flavor and had a slushy milk chocolate feel. The four of us shared one and that was enough for all of us. Four huge straws and a mound of whipped cream and chocolate chips on top. Nothing fancy, just a large quantity.

The slice of Cheesecake was HUGE. The cake wasn't overly sweet and had a wonderful cream cheese whipped cream on top that complimented everything pretty well. We worked our way eating around the cheesecake but could hardly make a dent in it! There is a raspberry jam at the bottom tjat also gave you a different take on the flavors. The cheesecake was my favorite.

I'm docking off a star because of the price. It came out to be a nearly $50 check for hot chcocolate and cheesecake....the food was good but not that good. You could be paying for the ambiance, but it isn't to the level of 4 Stars like some other dessert places on the strip.

Bottom line: you can do it for the experience, but I'm sure there are better dessert places. What does the word serendipity mean anyway???",1,0,1

The line was slow, but mainly b\/c people didn't think to look at the menu while IN line so I won't ding Serendipity for that.

This occurred after finishing about half of the to-go cup. This is definitely something you want to share, unless you LOOOOVE chocolate. Another downside was that there was a 2 hour wait to actually sit in the restaurant!! My friends and I opted for the to-go option instead, which was definitely our savior.

I, on the other hand, have been a patron of only their dessert slash frozen hot chocolate menu. The portions are humongo. A sundae will easily feed 2-3 people. Similar for the frozen hot chocolate. Prices are on par with a dessert of this size. If you order it for yourself it will seem like the prices are too high. But when sharing with others the cost per person is in line.

My boyfriend and I went sightseeing mid-morning in Vegas, planning to go to Serendipity for brunch. But when we saw the long lines and were told that it would be a 45 minute to an hour wait, we decided to pass. My boyfriend suggested that we make a reservation for breakfast for the next day. So we made a reservation for 9:15am in the morning through the app OpenTable via the Serendipity website, for the same day about one hour before the restaurant opens. We went to the restaurant and no problem! They received our reservation.

Luckily when we arrived there, it was not to busy (yet). We were deciding on what to order, and looked at what the other customers were having. One couple ordered and shared the Fried Chicken and Waffles, so my boyfriend and I followed suit and ordered the same thing. We also ordered one blueberry muffin, two coffees and Frozen Hot Chocolate.

Verdict on the food and drinks:
- Fried Chicken and Waffles: perfect for sharing for two! Comes with four bacon waffle triangles and fried chicken tenders, with home fried potatoes and maple syrup and honey mustard. Finger-lickin' good! It's the perfect balance and combination of sweet and savory; you get the sweetness from the maple syrup and waffles, and savory with the fried chicken tenders, home fried potatoes and honey mustard sauce. 
- Blueberry Muffin: tastes just like fresh blueberries! I thought it was too sweet, although it's really delicious! There are specks of sugar on top.
- Frozen Hot Chocolate: we ordered the regular size, which was still enough for two, just a smaller portion. As long as we get the Frozen Hot Chocolate, I'm good! Delicious chocolate goodness! Not too sweet, as the whipped cream helped balance it out. Loved the chocolate shavings, which added some crunch. 
- Coffee: the biggest coffee cups I have ever seen (and been served)! I love that each of us got our own creamer cups, although we wouldn't need that much creamer.

Customer service is awesome! Our waiter was friendly and prompt, consistently checking on us and refilling our waters and coffee. The menu is a tad pricy, but the portions are huge. Parking wasn't a problem for us, as the hotel we were staying at is close by so we just walked it. I'm sure there are a lot of hotels that do valet and have self-parking.",1,0,0

Honestly, I don't remember a thing about how it tasted but I figured it must have been good if there is now one in Vegas!

The place was crazy busy when we arrived but luckily I spotted a 'takeout' window on the side.  No biggie since I only wanted the frozen hot chocolate anyway.  Looking at the menu while waiting in line, I was shocked at the price for the frozen hot chocolate.  Most flavors were $11.  Flavors like 'peanut butter, mint or vanilla'.  No hint of fancy chocolate like Lindt or Ghirardelli flakes that might make the price worth it.  I bought anyway, the mochachino flavor, I wanted peanut butter but they were out and $12.97 later, ($1 for a plastic glass of tap water) I stood by the window and waited for my frozen hot chocolate.  They are fast, I will give them that, but what passed from the window into my hand was basically a grande frappucino at three times the price.  I'm not sure what others were raving about because nothing in that glass could come close to being worth the $11 price tag for the drink.  

As my friend and I wondered exactly why there are so many people at Serendipity we could only guess that 1 -they'd never been there before or 2- like me they couldn't remember having it the first time.  Apparently, if you actually sit down in the restaurant, the frozen hot chocolate is much larger which might have made me feel a tiny bit better.  However, either way, the melted milkshake with a load of whipped cream that is the frozen hot chocolate is not worth your time or money.  Go somewhere else.  There are plenty of gelato places in Vegas where you can get your ice cream fix if that is what you desire for 1\/3 of the price.",0,0,0

They serve brunch, lunch, and dinner. They have a variety of foods that range from spaghetti and meatballs to barbecued pork ribs. They are very popular for their humungous desserts. I have tried their classic sundaes, deep fried oreos, and their very popular frrrozen hot chocolate. Yes, frozen and hot. I know...it's a paradox, but you just have to try it to understand it. It's a very interesting drink that tastes like cocoa in hot chocolate, but it's cold and consistent to a strawberry daiquiri. Very unique, indeed. 

I haven't figured out a good time to come here without having to wait over 30 minutes for a table. If you're in a hurry, they have this grab-n-go service, which is on the side of the restaurant. There is a smaller menu of their most popular items for take-out.

I am a sucker for sweets and Serendipity has established it's own little place in my heart; especially when one of my all-time favorite movies is Serendipity!",9,4,6

I would like to say that our waiter Carlos gave us a wonderful experience. Upon walking in, we didn't have to wait for a table considering it's a Friday night. The decor had a very candy vibe. You know when you watch the Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory? It was like that. 

Once we were seated, we were given these huge menus to look at. It's like the size of a 4 year old baby. 
I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Burger and my lovely girlfriend decided on Penne Vodka Pasta With Sausage.   For dessert, we settled on a Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate. 

Our waiter Carlos, was very kind and recommended me to get the combo of a burger and hot chocolate since it was cheaper. He also was very attentive and told us the food would be coming out shortly. 

The food service comes out fast. Once I dove in my burger like how Trey Songz dives in, it tasted very good. The meat was cooked perfectly. The burger was very large and it couldn't fit in my mouth. LOL
It also came with a side of fries, which were crispier than your pair of Jordan's. 

My girlfriend enjoyed her Penne Vodka Pasta with toasted bread on top. The vodka sauce tasted just right like how I asked my girl to be my girlfriend. 
It was a huge plate so we took most of it to go. 

Frozen hot chocolate was good. It actually was a resemblance of a slushy. But overall, a nice experience to try it out since it was our first time here.

And it was perfect 100+ degree weather to try the much talked about frozen hot chocolate!! As soon as Phil V. and I found our friends inside, we downed our icy waters. It  was such a pain to find this place from the parking structure in back. Going thru the Casino..getting lost in the mall..asking workers how to get there and they didn't really know exact directions..and having to rush a bit under that heat. blech. just FYI, from ceasars parking structure, you head twds the right straight back twd the strip. 

So the food was okay. The frozen hot choc was BOMB ($10). Consistency was perfect enough to eat with a spoon and drink thru a straw. I loved sippin up the chocolate shavings and spooning off the whipped cream. Too delicious. We shared the bbq chicken flat bread pizza. It was good, but not super filling. Although I like thin crust pizzas, this one had too much thin crust and not enough sauce and chicken to go around. My friend's crab cake salad was REALLY good. If I came back, I'd order this for myself. The side of sweet potato fries ($4) were a little bland, but still crispy-good. The size is not worth that price though.
 
Service was excellent, kept our waters refilled for that especially hot day and removed our plates right away. Ambiance was a mix of old school ice cream parlor shaken with a bit of new school Vegas.

It's just a cold chocolate drink. The fried oreos was really good though. It was covered in like some sort of frosted flake cereal and then they fried it after. A good combination with the chocolate fudge and ice cream. This portion is pretty big depending on your appetite and cravings. I was with 2 of my cousins and we couldn't finish it.

First, the atmosphere is not the same, although there is still that whimsical feel it just felt off for some reason. 
Secondly, the frrrozen hot chocolate here is a poor, poor copy of the one you would get in New York. We got the mint frrozen hot chocolate for 2 and the size, although still big, seemed much smaller than the portion at Serendipity NY. But my biggest gripe is that it was lacking the fine ice crystals that I feel make frrrozen hot chocolate so unique. The drink wasn't nearly as cold as it should have been and since it lacked any ice it felt more like a melting chocolate milkshake and felt very rich and heavy as opposed to rich yet still refreshing.

The menu is also limited so there are some items missing such as the frrozen pink lemonade which is delicious and would be perfect in the Las Vegas heat. If you love Serendipity and find yourself unable to make a visit anytime soon to New York, Serendipity 3 might be a good option but if you've been to the others and are looking for the same experience I think you'll end up disappointed.",0,0,0

Unfortunately, this time we were seated outside with a server listed on my receipt as being named Phoenix. That girl sucked. She was one of those servers that just goes through the motions and truly doesn't give a crap about any part of the experience. I ordered a diet coke, hoping to get some caffeine in my veins to wake me up after a day at the pool, and she didn't deliver it until she brought the food. Over half an hour had gone by so I figured she forgot and I was okay with just giving up on it. I was shocked when she did bring it, but it was obvious this was some sort of ""do less work"" strategy so she didn't want to have to keep refilling it for me, so instead I paid $5 for one little glass of diet coke. Awesome. She never smiled once and completely disappeared when it was time to give us our check, take our credit card, and return it to us. It took so long I was standing there with my purse on my shoulder for a really long time, trying to send her a message that we were more than ready to stop inconveniencing her by being her table. We always tip whichever is greater between $10 flat and 20%, and it broke my heart to not be able to leave her anywhere near that, but she didn't deserve the 15% we did give her.

After eating at Serendipity, I feel like it's definitely one of those places that should specialize and serve only one type of food (basically they should stick to desserts). It's not that their food was bad - I thoroughly enjoyed my omelette - I just thought they were trying to cater to everyone when they should just have desserts. I'm sure that if I had dessert that my rating would be higher but for right now, 3 STARS. They did have a bunch of breakfast\/brunch options but they were a little pricey.

- Average food for above average price
- Meals were cold when served

These are the facts:

I made a reservation to celebrate my 5th wedding anniversary, I let the hostess know when I called and when I arrived that we were celebrating with our family and that most of us drove from out of state to have this meal, we were super excited. 

We sat nestled between the entrance and the hostess desk so that half of the table had the privilege of scooting our chairs for other parties being seated farther in the back, and the other table got to sit with the 3 hostesses' booties on their neck all evening.

We ordered drinks which were refilled only once during our pleasant 2 hour stay. 

Our orders were taken about 30 minutes from our being seated, but we didn't receive our food for another hour.

These are not my feelings, these are the cold, hard facts.

Cold and hard like the $26 fried chicken my husband ordered. His mashed potatoes were a soupy consistency. I have a picture if you wanna see.

My ABC Chicken sandwich was okay, the C stands for caramelized onions, but it was cold by the time I got a hold of it so they were more like soggy worms. Okay, that's not a fact, I don't know what worms are like but I can imagine.

More facts:
Someone in our party ordered a burger with no pink, but when he bit into it it was still bloody. The waiter did pop by 30 minutes later and asked if he wanted it remade but everyone's bubble had been burst by then. 

I told the manager I wasn't happy with my experience or the quality of the food. She was offended when I compared it to Red Robin, but I've never had a cold meal or left dissatisfied, so I think I did Red Robin a disservice by comparing these two. Sorry big red bird.

After the manager got over her indignation, she comped us a sundae. So our party of 8 shared a sundae. Kudos lady, thanks.

I felt bad that my family wasted time and money here. It was my decision and I have to live the rest of my life with that on my shoulders. Maybe I'll write the company instead of writing a passive-aggressive review on a third-party site... I think I'll do that.",0,0,0

What is nice is that while of course you're paying more than you would at an off-strip dining establishment, you're at least feeling like you're getting your moneys worth. My favorite cholesterol level raising option is their steak sandwich. It comes on a loaf (yeah a goddamn loaf) of garlic bread, an entire NY strip steak, bacon, and perfectly runny over easy eggs. It's $22 bucks (it seems pricey, I know), but it's big enough to share and both parties will be full and a little bit closer to a heart attack. Another favorite of mine is the lump crab and artichoke dip.It's decadent, indulgent, it's everything you want in a creamy, rich appetizer. I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the frozen hot chocolates. I've tried the original, the peanut butter, and the cookies and cream. Cookies and cream is my favorite, it's creamy, sweet and I'm sure it goes straight to your thighs. The original is alright, but I feel like it is missing the creaminess that like in a cold chocolate drink. Peanut butter was kinda gross and I didn't finish it. It had a lot more to do with the peanut butter taste not really gelling with the cold uncreamy texture that's inherent in this drink. If you really like peanut butter taste, but don't require a creamy texture, i.e. you eat crunchy peanut butter, you'll probably like it. If you like creamy peanut butter like Texans love guns, skip it. 

Service is hit or miss here. Usually good, but sometimes (especially if you're sitting outside I've noticed) your server seems to forget you and you have to wait for everything. The other thing I'm not a fan of is there indoor seating arrangements. I understand you want to maximize your space with tables because mo' tables, mo' money, but it's pretty cramped inside. Overall, if you're living in town and wanted to try it, try and go on a weekday during the low season.

While the menu is traditional American and none too adventurous if you're looking for an easy, albeit kind of pricey, lunch I recommend their delicious waffle fries alongside a Summer Bries sandwich. This sandwich is made of turkey, apples, cranberry mayo and brie served open faced on raisin pumpernickel bread. It is as good as it sounds.

Also good to know - they have sweet potato fries if you're a fan of them like me. Although here the waffle fries are better tasting I think. And of course, you can read the rest of the reviews to find out about desserts. As for me I went for the 25 cent gumball on my way out. ;-)",12,11,14

We got the Peanut butter frozen hot chocolate for two ($15) which was insanely good.  The hot chocolate was tasty but as soon as you sucked up the chunks of peanut butter, the flavor-meter went through the roof.  I highly recommend it.  

We also go the Crab Artichoke Dip ($12) and the Summer Bries sandwich ($16).  The dip was really tasty with big chunks of crab.  The only downside was the bread was kind of too hard.  Softer bread would have been better.  The sandwich was tasty with a large mound of turkey.  It was enough for two.  We saw another table with a fettuccine pasta dish that looked very tasty.

On our second visit (we were drunk) we got the All In Nachos and Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza. The nachos look delicious, but they taste so-so. I was really bummed that they just put melted cheese on the nachos instead of using nacho cheese (cheese whiz).

Our story.... we came in for a late lunch.  We ordered and the waitress mentioned that it will be a while before we get our food because they are busy.  Once she left, I looked around only to notice that they were only half filled to capacity (since the majority of their seating is outside and half of the outdoor tables were empty)  Go figure.

We ordered an appetizer, salad, and we were going to split the hamburger.
The appetizer arrived, and the hamburger arrived.... salad never made it.  Once we finished eating, we finally caught the waitress and asked about our salad... she apologized and said she would take it off the bill.  Take it off the bill????  Wow.... how generous of her considering we never received it!  

It was comical because when she said that, she was acting as if she was going to do us a huge favor by not charging us for that salad.

In addition, she had no sense of personal space....not sure if she was hard of hearing or what, but when we were ordering, she was leaning down right in our faces.... It was very annoying.

About the food.... bland!  Our hamburger was dry, the soda was flat and seriously, the cookie dough sundae could be made at home and it would have tasted much better than theirs.  Seriously overpriced.  Months before, I tried the Carl's Jr. hamburger version of what we ordered here and let me tell you, Carl's Jr. was a 10 on a 1 to 10 scale and this was a 1.

There are so many delicious restaurants to choose from in Vegas so I am shocked as to how little they care about good service and food here.

I think it is a good idea to look at Yelp before going into a restaurant because if you see the average is 3 out of 5 stars, its safe to assume that nearly half the people weren't satisfied.  That's huge.  Most of my favorite restaurants have 4 or 5 stars... figures this isn't one of them.",3,1,0

Not particularly since this spot has been open for quite some time in a prime spot right in front of Caesar's Palace. I've been to the original Serendipity 3 on East 60th in New York way before the dawn of Yelp, and more recently, patronized the one at Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach (which appears to have since shuttered). For the longest time, I kept wondering where Serendipity 1 and 2 were but finally realized the 3 refers to a trio of legendary princes from Sri Lanka. Jamie W. and I were just sauntering on the Strip when I cajoled him to come inside for a ""snack"".

It's quite a cavernous place with ""Happy Birthday"" apparently sung every ten minutes. The pink trim and animated design was befitting for an old-fashioned ice cream parlor which they were attempting to evoke. I already knew what I was getting, but Jamie spent a good amount of time studying the rather comprehensive, text-heavy menu. He settled on the $15 Deep Fried Snickers Sundae, which, you guessed it, contained chunks of deep-fried Snickers nestled between the scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream ladled liberally with hot fudge, caramel and peanut butter sauce. It was topped with peanuts and whipped cream, but they were superfluous to this decadent creation (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1T9YoB8).

As tempting as that gloppy mountain of sweetness was, I ordered the $16 Frrrozen Hot Chocolate with Mochaccino and Chocolate Chips. I was asked if I wanted a 'Large', but what that technically meant was a serving for two since there were two straws. It's the classic 'Serendipity 3' order that Marilyn Monroe and Jackie O. loved though probably didn't share at the same time given Jack's open door policy. I had no trouble downing it as it's sweetly tasty with plenty of whipped cream and chips for contrast (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1poDzWh). We noticed other tables had actual food like club sandwiches and Cobb salads. But not for us when we visit this place. Somebody sing ""Happy Birthday"" to me... even if it isn't my birthday.

The fam bamz decided to come here for an afternoon snack.  We heard about the rave of the ""Frozen Hot Chocolate"" and wanted to find out what the hype was all about.

It was around 3pm and to be expected, the place was mad busy.  There was an hour and 1\/2 wait for a party of 8.  There was plenty of outdoor tables and the weather was absolutely phenomenal during the month of March. We decided to try out their take out orders.  It's a limited menu but again, we were there strictly for dessert.

We were in line for 45 minutes.  I don't understand why there was a long wait when the orders consisted of ice cream.  I passed on the frozen hot chocolate - why do I need to spend $15 on a milkshake?  I went with the huge chocolate donut and the Forbidden Sundae which consisted of chocolate cake, chocolate and vanilla cream, whip cream, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top.  I waited another 15 minutes for my order to be prepared.  I saw my sundae sitting on the counter underneath an air vent that was melting my ice cream. It took another 10 minutes for the server to grab my donut.  By the time I was handed my sundae, the whip cream turned into milk and spilled over the cheesy cup.  The cake was hard and chewy.  The ice cream underneath and had already turned into mush.  It was the MESSIEST sundae I have ever dealt with.  It was sooo messy, that it got me angry and I just wanted to throw it away! The donut was nothing special....just  big.

This was the worst experience ever! Everyone wants to eat here because of the movie; well, I'm hear to tell you that the service and food is below standard!  WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!

We were a bit thrown off by the reviews about the food and ordered the foot long chili dog with sweet potato fries and the nachos. 

The food didnt take too long but our waiter was pretty shitty. 
We had a group of four seated next to us and one of the ladies was a bit tipsy. He was pretty rude to her and she ended up telling him that it was my friends birthday. 

The waiter said ""then he gets water for his birthday"" which was pretty silly. 

Anyways i didnt even ask if the hot dog was pork (which i don't eat) stupid of me not too but we asked later and they dont serve any beef hotdogs. Woops! So i didnt get to try it but my friend said it was okay. 

The nachos were great except the taco meat (beef) on them. Its cheap and gross tasting. 
Besides that it was a large portion and pretty good. 

Our waiter barely came around and was more concerned with the table next to us than he was with us. Thank god the table next to us was talking to us the entire time. Great crowd in from South Carolina for a convention for State Farm

Then we ordered the cookie cookie something ice cream sundae. 
That was the best item. The chocolate chip cookie in it was nasty and hard but the sugar cookies were soft and the ice cream was great. 

The best part of our experience here was our neighbors from State Farm :) pun intended.

For those that are too cheap to pay a $15-20 dollar tab for Serendipity's dine in menu, there is an alternative, somewhat inexpensive To Go menu. Here you will find hot dogs, pizzas, among other things, including their famous ""Frozen Hot Chocolate.""

For $8.50, the Frozen Hot Chocolate was rather unimpressive. Although the price isn't too bad upon comparing it with other places on the strip, it just doesn't make sense to order a cup of chocolate powder, whole milk, and ice for that high of a price. Knowing that I could have refilled my Fat Tuesday margarita for $9.00 made buying a Frozen Hot Chocolate without splitting it impossible. 

With this in mind, it's my recommendation that you split this drink with a friend or boo. This way you'll get the chance to try this famous drink without feeling too jipped.

First of all, the price of everything is ridiculous. Umm $17 for an omelette? Seriously? Granted, yes, when it came out, it was HUGE. Probably 2 meals worth of food. But so extremely pricey for not even being that good. It was nothing special. It did not ""hit the spot"" or anything. My friends ordered sandwiches and salads for lunch and just as the omelette, the portion sizes were incredibly huge (but also pricey).

For all you out of town folks who've heard about Serendipity, my advice is to visit the location for some frozen hot chocolate or just a sundae (and share it with like 10 of your friends). Their desserts are definitely amazing and beautifully prepared.

If you're in search of a brunch spot in Vegas after a night of fireball shots (just as I was), don't expect to feel satisfied after Serendipity. Their food isn't that great and paying over $20 (with tax\/tip) for a mediocre meal didn't make me feel so great either.",0,0,1

There was absolutely no space that night (Sunday night) and so they suggested we ordered in their outside stand.  We therefore proceeded to do that and by the time we got there, they sold NOTHING.

The pizza actually had way too much bbq sauce it was a bit overbearing and the crust was way too doughy.  The nachos were just drizzled in cheese whiz and something I could have totally made myself.

The frozen hot chocolate is worth trying, but is overpriced for what it is.

The food is far too mediocre for their hefty prices. The dishes were unimpressive to the point where none of us finished them. If their prices had been lower, then I wouldn't have complaints about the quality of food.

What prompts me to write a two star review was the poor customer service in my most recent visit. The restaurant wasn't too busy on a Wednesday afternoon, but everything about our experience was both slow and full of errors. To start, water took approximately 30 minutes to come, after having to flag the servers down a couple of times. The iced coffee came, not with our waters, but after our incorrect orders of food came.

It was pretty crowded which is imeediately a downer for me. But we managed to snag three spots at the bar just as a couple was leaving so we didn't have to wait for a table. The decor is really cute in a sugary, Alice in Candyland sort of way. I was told they are known for their frrrozen hot chocolates, but I needed actual food first, so I settled on a brie cheese sandwich minus the raisin pumpernickel bread. They switched out my bread with batting an eye.  

While we waited for food, the bartender entertained me in the best way possible. With alcohol. And I got to watch everybody elses alcohol and hot chocolate creations being made. I tried a cotton candy martini just because it sounds cute and he said there is actual cotton candy in it. Cool! I picked the apple flavor and He shoved a big chunk of cotton candy in the glass. Cute! But it just melt away as soon as the alcohol hits it and it tasted just like an oversweet apple martini. Meh. I guess I thought it would be pink, have cotton candy magically floating in it and taste like cotton candy. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=SDqnof-g7auFCdvv4TzNPg

For $11, I expected something memorable. What I got was a 30 minute wait for a table of 2 and what tasted like a slushy of cocoa powder mix with whipped cream on top.

It was vaguely similar to Godiva's new line of shakes known as the Trufflelatas ($6), but the frrrozen hot chocolate was nowhere near as rich or decadent. 

But it is Vegas, and it was a hot summer day. However, I could do without the dismissive attitudes of the staff the next time I decide to spend $11 on a hot chocolate and $5 on a teeny tiny can of apple juice.

And although there were awesome finds on the menu, there were a few disppointments as well. 

What you can definitely tell from their menu is that Serendipity 3 aims to please.  Their options for food and beverages are deliberately decadent, pushing the limits of comfort food beyond counting calories into a happy place close to Willy Wonka's chocolate river.  The place also envelopes you in a quirky pink atmosphere.

We had the $30 jumbo lump crab entree for appetizers, and though steep, was worth every dollar.  Huge chunks of (what tasted like fresh) crab in a good mustard seed sauce.  The onion rings were huge (and that's about it), I've had better, way better.  The ahi tuna salad would've really rocked if the ahi was larger and of better quality.  The ABC burger with brie cheese, avocado and caramelized onions seemed so great in theory, and I don't know if we just received a bad execution.  The burger was dry, inspite of the luscious toppings.  

And finally, the frozen hot chocolate came to our table. My eyes and my mouth were drooling.  I closed my eyes as I took my first sip and... and it tastes like a regular chocolate milkshake.  Sigh, the pitfalls of having high expectations.  I dunno, I was expecting something more.. frozen? More chocolate goodness? But what I had was a melted version of a milkshake.. that came in a larger, prettier package.

So all in all, we enjoyed and perhaps this review really suffered from high expectations.  Oh, and the fact that they didn't have rest room in the restaurant.  My husband said he had to share the public toilet with some bums shaving their beards.  Will we go back?  Maybe when we're really parched and in the mood for crab cakes.  I'll invest  my $12 in other chocolate milkshakes.  Or a martini.",1,1,1

You suck. 
Craig R. 

I had wanted to try their famous frozen chocolate drinks and massive sundaes for a long, long time. When I was in Vegas a few weeks ago, my group of four went to the restaurant at about 10:15pm on a Friday night. When I walked in there were many tables open in the main dining room and on the outdoor patio. When I asked how long the wait was for my party I was told forty minutes. I wasn't sure I heard the hostess correctly so I asked ""I'm sorry, did you say forty minutes?"" To my question the hostess rudely replied ""YES, I DID. Just wait outside and we'll call you when we have a table available"". Once outside we encountered a couple also waiting for a table and they said they had already been there twenty minutes and they had seen many diners leaving but they still had not been seated. 

After waiting about ten minutes (the couple still had not been called in) my group and I decided to just go to their walk up window. We ordered one large frozen peanut butter hot chocolate, one regular frozen hot chocolate and a chocolate cake sundae. The large frozen PBHC was huge and pretty damn tasty but I was so disappointed I didn't get to try it in one of their big glass mugs topped with mounds of whipped cream. The regular frozen HC was decent sized too and equally as tasty. Honestly though, I felt they charged too much for their to-go drinks. The price for the to-go drinks are the same as if you were to get them in the restaurant. Since you're not getting the true Serendipity experience I thought they'd at least cut back the $13 price tag for the large drink ($10 for the regular). 

The sundae wasn't very good. The piece of cake in the sundae seemed like it had been setting out a while. The cake itself was a tad stale and slightly crunchy. At least the guys running the to-go window were friendly. 

I'm still not sure why the wait was so long when they had so many open tables. I saw a bunch of servers when I was putting my name in so I don't think they were understaffed or anything like that. After looking over the many reviews on Yelp I see a lot of people complaining about the bad service they received. Maybe Serendipity thinks because they are so popular they can treat people like garbage because they will never be hurting for business. If that's the case, which I'm assuming it is, then they can take their big frozen hot chocolates and shove it up their behinds. 

Besides, Max Brenner is only five minutes away from here and I know from experience that they truly care about their customers and that their products, especially their shakes, are top notch. I wouldn't return to Serendipity's now if you paid me. They suck.",19,17,15

I have yet to visit the original location in NYC, but I've been told that you should avoid the food at all cost and only come for the desserts - even then be prepared to bring seven of your closest friends in order to comfortably share and completely finish ONE slice of cake and frozen hot chocolate. 

I had the mistake of having eyes bigger than my appetite. I got greedy after looking over the menu and instead of just order ONE frozen hot chocolate, I ordered the CHOCOLATE BLACK OUT CAKE to accompany it to share with two others. 

* Frozen Hot Chocolate 
For the non-chocoholics: don't waste your money on this confection as it will probably taste like any old frozen blended chocolate concoction to you. However, if you dream\/breathe in chocolate I highly recommend it as you can taste a slice of specialness at the end of each sip. I don't know if its a hint of nutmeg, a smidge of some unique cocoa, or even just cinnamon - but its pretty delicious! 

*Chocolate Black Out Cake
I ordered this cake under pressure\/pure excitement for just being at Serendipity. I was reading the anecdote on the front of how the three came to be and create Serendipity when it mentioned the cake. Seeing that it was spotlighted, I figured that I just HAD to have it. 

WARNING: DO NOT COMBINE FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE W\/ CHOCOLATE BLACKOUT CAKE, no really, I don't care how much you believe that you love chocolate...because honestly, your insides are going to taste of chocolate for the next 24 hours because of the overdose of chocolate. 

Nonetheless, this is MY FAVORITE way to eat chocolate cake - SUPER rich and dense, dredged in chocolate ganache and piled high. Sadly, as ambitious and driven as my guests and I were we did not finish the tower of chocolate - one slice would have easily fed a 10 year old's birthday party. 

Price: you get what you pay for - order a few items, but bring a crowd, you'll need the back-up 
Atmosphere: whimsical and fun
Overall: Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll stop in the first night of the weekend, that way I'll have three days to finish the cake!",1,0,0

This location sits in front of Caesar's right off the Strip.  It is not very big inside and there are limited seats (inside and out) and that translates to long lines.  It is cute - all white with pink and orange accents.  However, the way around the lines are just heading to the window outside the sit down restaurant to get your sweet treats.  This too can result in a long line, but it moves!  

My hubby and I ordered a couple 16oz Fro Ho's and found a ledge to sit to drink them, since the limited outside seating was all full!  It is a huge outside space and they fill less than half of it with seating, which results in people plunking themselves everywhere!?  Duh, put out more seats!  You have the room!!!  Anyways, we sampled out Fro Hos and enjoyed the people watching opportunity that this section of Caesar's gives us.  

The Fro Ho tasted exactly how you would expect - an icy version of the winter treat.  It was yummy and just as good in the sun on a ledge as it would be inside - maybe not as pretty, but I loved it all the same.

We showed up to wait for a table (mind you there are about 45 tables open outside and we were okay with eating outside). The hostess said it would be a 15 minute wait anyway (why? I don't know). So we're sitting outside by the door and near a fan. We've been waiting for a while and I get up to go check to see if they called our name. Apparently the hostess did (inside? she knew we were outside) and since we weren't there crossed us off the list and moved us to the bottom. She was also very rude to us about it. 

Whatever, no big deal. I'll take your attitude, just seat me, I'm starving. 

Finally after waiting for a few minutes (this time I stood near their hostess station so they knew I was in existence) and my party was seated. Naturally it was uncomfortably hot but we were seated in probably the worst area. It was so hot, I was disgustingly (and embarrassingly) taking ice out of my drink and letting it melt on my legs. :hangs head in shame:

Our waiter was very nice and made up for the hostess. I wanted lunch and asked for something ""small."" Apparently their tuna salad was the smallest salad but this thing was massive!!! It was very good, but I'm still cautious about getting fish in the middle of the desert. 

Anyway, no dessert. I think if I was back in Vegas and wasty face, I'd make a stop to try the dessert. Otherwise, I probably could get bitched at by a hostess at a snootier restaurant and feel less bad about it.",0,1,0

This review is also concerning their window ONLY.  I really wanted to go to their restaurant the next time we go to New York, but if this window is a representation of Serendipity 3's brand and values, I am NEVER eating their food again. 

Our experience at the window was THAT bad!

We were only in Las Vegas for one day and wanted to do all the fun stuff instead of gambling.  I had always wanted to go to Serendipity 3 but we just never got around to it during other trips so we decided to try it.  I was really, REALLY excited about the frozen hot chocolate because I had heard about it so many times from people like Whoopie Goldberg, Jessica Simpson and of course from the movie Serendipity.

Here is my warning to you, head it if you will: DO NOT ORDER FROM THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD EXPERIENCE!!  I say this after an hour of waiting in their line for below average food.  There was a long wait for the restaurant so silly us thought the window would be faster.  We stood in that line for an HOUR and then once we ordered our food, it took us 20 minutes to actually get a very simple order, which was a chili cheese hot dog, fries and 2 frozen hot chocolates.  Apparently, there was only 2 people working the window for a line of about 50 people.  One girl, who I actually need to commend for keeping her cool.  She was very nice and it didn't seem like the pressure was stressing her out.  The cook on the other hand, was a complete jerk.  It seemed like he was just hanging out back there, not concerned about the line or even caring that people get their food in a timely manner.  He even took off for 20 minutes which is why it took our food so long to actually get to us.  When he came back, he took a sip of his drink and ate some chili, COMPLETELY unconcerned that he had a job to do and maybe needed to do it quite urgently.  Perhaps these are the wrong employees to be working this window.  I suggest getting maybe 4 people who have a deep sense of urgency.  These two lackluster employees are not going to cut it.  I could hear people crumbling behind us about how long the wait was and why were simple orders taking so long.  I felt inclined to get out of the line a few times and didn't because of what I thought I was getting, which was SUPPOSED to be an amazing meal and the rumored delicious frozen hot chocolate.

This did not happen.  The food arrived to us cold.  This is because nothing is fresh in this poor excuse for a kitchen.  Everything is just sitting there.  The chili was cold (and too sweet by the way,) the cheese was half frozen and not melted, which means the chili wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese, the wiener was overcooked but cold on the inside and the bun wasn't toasted, the fries were soggy and cold, and the frozen hot chocolates, ohhh.....

The frozen hot chocolates were a HUGE disappointment!  The drink itself was pre-made and had been sitting on the counters the whole time we were in line because I could see inside the window.  The whipped cream was good and I guess the drink tasted ok but it was warm because it had been sitting there and it was melted.  The actual idea of the ""frozen hot chocolate"" is just ridiculous.  It's basically a glorified shake.  I THOUGHT it was hot chocolate with a scoop of ice cream in it! THAT would have been MUCH better!  Instead, I got a watered down shake I could have gotten at Baskin Robbins.  I don't really like Baskin Robbins but in this case, it would have been WAY better than what we were served.  It would have been fresh too.

The prices are also really outrageous.  $12 for a glorified shake?!?!  After an hour and 20 minutes, we were able to sit down.  The food was completely inedible.  My husband, who normally keeps his cool and tells me to let things go, was outraged.  This coming from a guy who will eat ANYTHING!  We discussed how we would handle this and the possible ramifications and decided that we NEEDED to say something. 

I went to the restaurant and asked for the manager and saw that the inside of the restaurant was WAY better than the window.  It was like a completely different restaurant.  The manager came out and was really helpful.  I told her of our experience and dissatisfaction and let her know that I normally wouldn't ask for a refund because it's more about letting them know so they can improve but our experience was so negative that I was demanding a refund at this point.  She was very nice and said she completely agreed and rushed to get me a refund.  That made the situation slightly better and I appreciate that there are at least people in the main restaurant that know what good customer service is.

I am really sad that this experience has tainted my want to try this restaurant again.  Even if I go to New York.  Stay away from the window in Las Vegas and I am sure that their food is actually good.",4,1,3

The frrrozen hot chocolate is delicious! Let's just start with that. It's not huge, but it's perfect to share with two straws and tons of whipped cream.

But $11 dollars for one? After having it I was already making plans to make my own at home with hot chocolate mix and my blender (I'm sure it can be done, right?) It seemed like a perfect dessert spot and I really wanted to try the nachos - I saw my friends had some and it looked delicious and for only $7! 

I'm glad I came to try the frrrozen hot chocolate since it has been on my ""Vegas to do list for a while"" and it was delicious, just too long of a line (waited 30 minutes to an hour), too slow of service, and kind of too expensive for just dessert.. especially with no alcohol content in it at all.

Its a great casual restaurant located right on the strip. It has a cute little whimsical vibe that simply makes me happy every time I come here. 

Serendipity is known for desserts, including frozen hot chocolate and the $1,000 golden opulence sundae. (Yes, $1,000... don't think I'll ever try that one unless I hit it big in the casino.) The frozen hot chocolate is very rich and tasty, and definitely a good thing to try while in the hot desert. During my most recent trip, my husband and I spilt the cookie sundae. The two of us together couldn't even finish it! Cookie dough ice cream mixed with three fresh baked cookies and topped with whipped cream and hot fudge... yum!

All of the food I've ever had here has been pretty solid as well. The triple decker grilled cheese is my favorite. It's so flippin' cheesy and gooey! I love it! The portions are all very large and can easily be split between two... especially if you're planning on dessert.

It's way expensive ($16.50 for a burger!), but it's Vegas. At least the portions are HUGE. The boy ordered the steak sandwich and it was as long as his arm (it was really good, too).

You know what it was that knocked this place down to a 3 star rating? It's all the rave about the frozen hot chocolate.  I was like, ""How is anything frozen & hot? Stoooopid.""

What I would prefer to order is the fried oreo sundae.  It's uber sweet and huge so make sure that you share with other people.  But I'm all about texture, so the crunchy & crispiness of the warm fried oreos accompanied by the cold vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup is a better option than the cold, chocolate slush.

The only other thing I ordered there were their nachos, which was good, but it's nothing that I'll crave.

What they have going for them is their (1) reputation, (2) optimal location: middle of the strip in front of Cesar's palace, (3) the novelty of the restaurant (there being only three other locations), and (4) it's cute and fun diner-like decor.  However, with all the other amazing palaces to eat in Vegas, I'm not sure that Serendipity's would make it on my list of ""must-eats"".

One of the 3 hostesses basically kicked some of the glass over to the hostess stand and that was about it, so everyone that walked in automatically walked into a pile of glass. 

I just kept watching and watching thinking a manager would do something when they came up. Nothing happened. So finally one of the servers (wait staff) walked by that had not been in the area for awhile. She saw the mess, looked around, kinda shook her head (you could tell she was thinking WTF), then ran off got a broom, dustpan, etc and cleaned it up.

Extremely good or extremely disappointing. I had heard so much about this place online and when I visited Vegas I wanted to see what all the buzz was about. The three stars are ONLY for the drinks we ordered. We were a group of three for brunch and ordered:

The breakfast bagel sandwich: This was probably the only dish worth mentioning. Nothing great, the usual eggs, bacon, ham , cheese... BUT, not disappointing at least! With those ingredients I feel it's very hard to make a bad dish.

Chicken & waffles: Tasteless and insipid. 

BBQ & blue burger : Such a bad burger! One would think that the ingredients of blue cheese and bacon could save the dish, apparently not!! The meat was dry and over cooked. For a place that charges that much, I would've liked them to ask me how I wanted my burger cooked! The fries on the side however, were well seasoned and the right amount of crisp.

Now the drinks ....

The Frozen Hot Chocolate lived up to it's expectations! Rich, thick and wonderful, topped with whipped cream. It's definitely worth the try.

A boozy milkshake with peanut butter and a liquor that I cannot remember. YUM!! Served in tall glass with whipped cream and a cherry on top! It was really, really good. 

Mimosas were fresh and crisp and we let the raspberry dropped into it soak up all the alcohol before eating it.

Frozen Hot Chocolate - I've had this before about 9 years ago in New York and I am glad to say that it tastes exactly the same as I remembered it.  Chocolatey, creamy, and smooth without being too rich.  Very refreshing and light.  The regular size is just the right amount of share even though it says the large is for two.

Hot Wings - Eh... I hate when I order wings and the skin is SOGGY and MUSHY.  The sauce is much spicier than what most restaurants offer on their wings.

I love this place. Yes, it's on the strip. Yes, it's a little bit pricey... but it is everything a Yelper would love! It's a COOL spot and it is FUN!

Serendipity 3 is strip side with a large outdoor patio (stripside), a small interior dining room, and little walk-up window for to-go orders. The place is spacious and clean. The portion sizes are large and good for sharing (which I recommend).

Now, let's get down to business... And by business I mean FROZZZEN HOT CHOCOLATE. Yum! My favorite is the Peanutbutter Frozzzen Hot Chocolate and it's garnished with mini Reeses! 

My favorite burger is the ABC Burger (Avacado, Brie, and Caramalized onions). It's such a tasty burger topping trio (say that 3 times fast). My sister is a fan of their Ruben, even declaring that it has some of the best corned beef, ever, on it. Sandwiches and burgers are accompined by choice of traditional or sweet potato fries.

There are some pretty stellar desserts. Sundaes, cakes, and shakes! I have always been too full to try some. I may just have to plan a dessert trip before my next outing to Caesars.

Serendipity 3 is like a really nice McDonald's. It's hip, it's fun, and it's tasty. Great for a quick bite or a refuel while galavanting around The Strip.

To be noted: The walkup window serves all varities of the tasty FROZZZEN HOT CHOCOLATE, sandwichs, hot dogs, salads, and a few other items.So in case you don't have time to dine in you can pick up some Serendipity 3 while you're on the move.

Being from ""The Bay"" I've had my fair share of Ghirardelli chocolate sundaes in Monterey, CA and at the flagship shop at Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco. For around $9, and rarely a long wait, you can get a killer sundae that's big enough to split. Contrast this with the New York institution that is Serendipity - $14+ for a sundae!!! You've got to be kiddin' me!

After eating at Hofbräuhaus last night, my sister and I headed on over to Serendipity 3 for my birthday dessert. Somehow it took nearly an hour to get over to S3, but once we got to the building, we were able to walk right in and get seated. 

I'm too cool and too poor to pay $10-$15 for powdered milk and cocoa power blended with ice (Frozen Hot Chocolate.) Forget about it! I chose the $14 Strawberry Fields Sundae. Seriously, strawberry ice cream PLUS cheesecake - PSSSSH, as if there was another option out there for me to chose! Granted, I've always been the girl to choose gummy worms and jolly ranchers over chocolate and would never try to rip somebody's eyes out for a Hershey's bar during ""that time of the month."" 

We waited a good 20 minutes for the sundae to arrive. Just as I was telling my sister that ""this was the kind of stuff that makes me rate a place 2 stars"" our waiter waltzed in with this HUGE strawberry sundae - definitely enough for at least four people to share. We had a TON left over to take home. 

The sundae was divine but the long wait time, coupled with the ridiculous prices (seriously, +$1 for sprinkles?!)  makes for a 2 star experience. This sundae could EASILY be recreated at home with a slice of NY cheesecake from any supermarket, a pint of strawberry Häagen-Dazs and a ton of strawberry sauce and whipped cream for a mere fraction of the cost of this sundae. 

There is no way that this would be an affordable place to eat out at if you were #1 not sharing, #2 eating a meal as well as a dessert. I think I'd rather skip the high prices and make a copy-cat at home.",1,1,1

We went to Serendipity 3 yesterday after missing it last year. First, the hostess had a bad attitude. Second, we had to wait 20 minutes and it wasn't full. The only good thing about that is that they don't give you a pager, they text you. There were numerous tables that we could have sat at and there was a large number of people taking ice cream to go and sitting under the large shade tent that was nearby. I think there is a bit of Studio 54 going on here as evidenced by our experience and the other reviews. It wasn't cute then and it isn't now.

We did have a bubbly waitress (but she didn't give us our TR discount). I had a classic hot fudge sundae and my sister had the famed Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. I could have made the sundae better at home and that's not something I should be able to say for something I paid $13 (I have the Total Rewards card, which was supposed to give me a  $1 discount, but she didn't apply it although I gave her my card) for. It was vanilla ice cream, fudge, (a LOT of ) whipped cream and chocolate chips (their overuse of whipped cream has been spoken of in other reviews). There was just as much fudge around the base of my glass as there was in it. I am not sure if that was just sloppiness or they thought it was cute. I've had amazing hot fudge sundaes with the same ingredients, so it's all in what you choose. They seem to throw chocolate chips on everything ice cream here as they were on my sisters Frrrozen Chocolate as well. 

On to that. She didn't think it lived up to the hype at all, especially for $13. I didn't taste it. But again, you shouldn't be charging this kind of money for things that are just, ""Meh"". The decor inside is old and needs a rehaul. It's cute when you first walk in (and I LOVE the color pink), but upon closer inspection, it's ratty.

The bartender apologized for the bad food. But did not offer a discount, even after he saw my entire meal was left on the plate. 
They get a star for presentation. 
The drinks: Blueberry lemon drop is tasty, refreshing and potent. 
Strawberry chocolate mojito is also another refreshing drink. Not very minty.

Love it. Even though really it's Ice Chocolate, but still good! I always look forward to coming here everytime I'm in vegas. The last time I visited and most recent we got the Banana Split. For it being about $15ish dollars was WELL WORTH IT!

It was HUGE! Like 4 scoops of ice cream, maybe even two bananas and strawberries w\/ lots of caramel and chocolate on top. It was byfar the best one I've ever tasted. What I loved was when asking the person taking our orders which would be best, he did not try to upsell us to get the more expensive item.

4. 55 minutes later we ask what the status of the meal is?
5. We get a reply of it's really busy and it will take some time, by this time 2 other tables behind us with 5 to 6 people at the table have come in, ordered and had their food brought to them. 
6. We talk to a manager and he goes well Ill get you a free ice crème for the wait. 
7. We find a new manager who comes over and asked us what the issue was, we informed her it has now been 1 hour and 15 minutes and still no meal.

Let's be real here, the order never got entered, we waited and waited and nothing good came from it.  The food once it showed up was good, not the best but not the worst either.  I ate there last year and everything was top notch, this is just suck! 

At Chilis when this happened to us, the entire meal was free without us having to ask, just because it's LV they figure screw it nobody will care.  Well we do care, our 200$ next trip won't be going to your joint, we had to ask for a manager to come over, he never even came over to say sorry to our whole group.

Items

Frozen Hot Chocolate: It could also be called ""frozen chocolate milk"" but hey if the trash man can be a waste management technician this can be frozen hot chocolate too. Anyways, it's as good as they say it is. It is different from a  milkshake because it is not thick but it comes with a sharp sweetness that makes this so distinct. As for sizing, order 1 up if you plan on sharing, unless you have a sweet tooth don't over spoil your experience with one. 4.25\/5

French Toast Logs: These sweet things were tailored fluffy and thick to allow for the syrup to be absorbed just right. Add their whipped cream that does not taste like your lucerne canned option at Ralph's, squeeze in a sweet berry and the bites taste like something you'd get at a breakfast cafe on Sunset (LA) or Coast Village Road (Santa Barbara). Oh and it comes with eggs and your choice of whatever choice breakfast spots always give you. 4.25\/5

This location is not nearly as charming as the location in NYC, but we did not have high expectations of that since this is a second location, aimed at tourists on the stip.  

We showed up around 4 pm on Saturday, thinking we would be seated quickly since it wasn't a prime dining hour.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  Not bad, but there were plenty of empty tables around.  Perhaps they were short staffed.  We did find it strange that the hostess did not give us the option to sit inside or outside.

I came inside with my girl there was no line and barely anyone eating. Their was no sign that said wait to be seated and nobody was at the counter. So we sat our selfs then one of the old Caucasian waitresses walked up to us and said we had to get up and wait to be seated very rudely. She didn't even greet us. She also said that this section was closed off. There were also no signs that said area was closed and we actually were sitting next to a few other groups of people that were seated. So I don't see how a section could be closed off if there were multiple tables filled around us and nothing saying otherwise. So we get up and go to the counter the Caucasian hostess with black hair walks up and a male co-worker does too and starts talking to her mean while there is like 3 other groups waiting in line now and we are in the front. She talks to him for a few minutes about stuff that isn't even work related. About 5 minutes into it I had to interrupt them since they were not paying attention to the growing line. I noticed both of them glanced at us and continued to talk. This to me appears very rude. I think they don't like young mixed couples and the way we dressed are something. Its not like they had to prep any tables because they all were all already clean and waiting for people to use them. Then they sat us furthest in the back from everyone which appeared very racial in my opinion. I think we were the only minorities. I would not go back to this place. The food was decent nothing amazing. The prices high vs the quality of the food. I expect better service from the strip and Caesars. If I could I wouldn't even give them a star on service alone.

Hoping that Serendipity would live up to it's bragging rights as a great dessert shop, and at a really good location, I was slightly disappointed.

Now, first, lets just talk about the positives about the shop. I think the frozen hot chocolates does live up to its expectation. It is amazing, and delicious! We had the classic Serendipity regular hot chocolate, and the amaretto hot chocolate. My favorite was the amaretto. I would definitely go back to try it again, and I can almost be sure that sometime soon I will crave for it (come spring or summer time). Judging by the price comparison that was described on the photo captions on their yelp page, and their menu, it looks like the prices have gone up. We paid $13  for the hot chocolate size that fits for two. The portion is big and it was good enough for three people to feel satisfied, and less guilty. The onion ring tower was ok. It is seasoned with grated Parmesan, and it comes with a BBQ and Ranch as dipping sauces. We also had the lobster and artichoke dip with bruschetta slices. That was about $13, and felt really robbed. 8 small pieces of bread and  miniature cup of dipping? I wanted to cause a scene for that ridiculousness! 

Now the bad side, the service is freaking horrible. I mean, seriously seriously bad. I'm pretty easy going and it's very hard to let me down, but on the day of my birthday when everything was going great the one thing that slightly destroyed it all was the service. The hostesses weren't really doing their job. We had no welcoming greet, no small talk, and I even saw frowns on their faces! Then, our server Jessie didn't really tend to us very much. She asked us only ONCE if we wanted more water and that was AFTER she gave us the check? She never even checked up on us, and the place was freaking slow! Her ""have a nice day"" just seemed so insincere and animated. I just felt like I was completely disregarded, and that I was some person who didn't deserve some decent service because I didn't ""look"" the part or something. I just felt so bad..i mean this is the second worst service I've ever had and the first was McDonald's! But I can't even blame them because they are probably slaving in the kitchen at a low paying wage! 

Work at McDonald's flipping burgers if you aren't gonna even TRY to give good service! For the price I fork up for freaking frozen hot chocolate I should at least get decent service.",2,0,0

It wasn't very busy when we arrived, so we were seated right away (Note: we were seated right away, because it wasn't busy). However, the server didn't come greet us until 10 minutes in. And when he did, there was no apology for the delay. We ordered the sweet potato waffle fries and some ice teas. The drinks came out relatively quickly, but the fries took another 15 minutes. When they came out they were cold; and I don't mean not hot, I mean cold. The server also didn't tell us that they were out of the cinnamon dipping sauce until after he brought out the fries. Again, no apology, just stated as a matter of fact. 

When the server brought the fries out, we ordered a frozen hot chocolate (their staple drink). After 25 minutes, it finally came out. Again, no apology for the delay.

We were each missing something in our burgers and we ended up not even getting the stuff after we politely asked for it. No biggie though, they are human. Gil was our server and he was absolutely awesome and he ended up giving us cool places to go that only the locals know of. A must go place if you're on the strip.",0,0,0

I opted for cheeseburger sliders which fit the bill.

It's a neopolitan confetti layered birthday ice cream cake and it had these crunchy little balls on the side and in the layers. This huge slice could feed about 4 people. My favorite part of the cake was the strawberry ice cream. I felt special eating it because I was graced with its beautiful magical presence. Service was really great and the decor reminded me of an old school yet modern diner. The only thing is that they're really pricey. Sprite for $5? Ridiculous! Don't order soda.

Arrived around 12:30 and put our names down and got one of those little buzzer things that lets you know when your table is ready.  We got some snacks at the to-go window to hold us over for the 45 minute wait and sat near the bar.

The buzzer makes a beeping noise 20 minutes in, so one of us walks up to the hostess and she looks at him like he's crazy and tells him to go sit back down cause our table isn't ready. We wait, we wait, we wait we wait....well over the 45 minutes we were initially told (with no beep from our buzzer thingy) and another one of us heads up to the hostess only to be informed that we were marked as ""no show"" and they've gone 3 or 4 people past on the waiting list.  Promises of a table in 20 minutes are made, we all gather and gang up and the wait drops to 5 minutes.  

Our server was super busy, so she wasn't especially attentive to our table.  Things were forgotten, checking in was infrequent, it was hard to flag her down if we needed something...we also wanted to order off the lunch menu, but brunch doesn't end until 2pm...so we wait some more...since it was 1:40 by the time we were seated.

Food finally arrived, and for the price it was terrible.  There's not much to say...the portions were huge, but what's the point if it doesn't taste good?? Fried chicken was soggy, the grilled cheese was also soggy and kind of weird tasting and the frozen hot chocolate, although presented nicely, contained more whip than chocolate and turned watery pretty quick.  The reuben was meh...but if the best thing on the table is only a mediocre tasting reuben that cost $15...well...it's infuriating.

Las Vegas is filled with restaurants that are, without much effort, better than this place.  Go somewhere else when you're in town unless you're completely drunk (e.g. you don't care if your food is kinda gross) and you just won some money in the casino to waste on this place.",0,0,0

The verdict? It was good. Redonkculously overpriced. But good. 

We dined with 7 of us. Me and hubby shared the footlong chili cheese dog, steak fries, and Mac and cheese. The dog was huge! I feel like it was more like 18' plus 1 1\/4 inches in diameter. But at $16, it better be! It was served on a full baguette in lieu of a bun. The chili was a bit sweet and there was shredded cheddar sprinkled on top. I thought more cheese was in order; plus I would have like it melted and not as an afterthought garnish. The steak fries were surprisingly good. The Mac and cheese was delectable. Truffley and cheesy yum. $14. 

Warning: they charge you for sharing but you get an additional side. So, not a bad way to go. Portions are large. 

6 of us shared one ""can't so no sundae."" Even with 6 people,  no contest. It was man vs. food and food won! The sundae was incredibly rich and sweet. Legit fudge and whipped cream.

Easy to leave this place w\/o paying which I kind of felt like doing.
Sundae we order came out super melted and all over the place.  We ate a few bites & the FHC we shared was good but not to die for that I was thinking it might be.

Serendipity 3 is located right in the front street of ceasers palace. Its location is very central on the strip and cannot be easily missed when walking by. Reservations are easy online via opentable. No hassles there.

Once seated the waiter seemed nice. He was very polite but seemed rushed. Looking around this place is really busy. Its bustling and for my mid weekday visit the patio was full and the restaurant was filling up fast. 

Personally I think you should stick to the frozen hot chocolates when you eat here. Its what they are known for and are really filling. Its basically a chocolate slushie. For $13 its good for sharing for 2 people. I almost always order one but can never finish it!

Ive had the mint chocolate, white chocolate and the regular chocolate. My favourite was the the regular out of all three. Ive found the added flavours made the dessert overwhelmingly sweet. I barely could down my white chocolate one bc it tasted like pure frozen sugar. It is the simple things that make some dosjes fabulous. Amd thats why this place is fabulous. The frozen hot chocolate is a must on every visit I make to the las vegas strip. Its something about frozen desserts in the dessert that are sooooo satisfying. After a long day of sightseeing this dessert is awesome.

As for the other items on the menu...well they are all fillers if you ask me. Just typical burgers or hot dogs or quick food which will fill you up and leave little to no impression on you. Ive had the kobe beef sliders which were 3 small sliders that were nothing fancier than your average mini burger. I minused a star bc it was just too plain. The fancy meat was just flat out boring. The accompaniments were boring too. It was so average I thought  who knew these big prices would lead to such plain boring food. 

Price wise. Im sure there are better deals for desserts in vegas. $13 a pop for dessert is pretty pricy considering its mostly ice. So I minused a star for the inflated prices leaving a poor impression on me. My kobe beef sliders were boring and I would not order them again. So my advice....skip the food menu.

So me and my cousin arrived at Serendipity and we see a long line outside as well as an empty seating area.

And then you remember there are things such as fried ice cream in this world, as well as the insane level of heat in the Vegas dessert that makes all of these preconceived notions go away.

Alas, Serendipity has helped me combat my drunken state with some very tasty desserts.  The actual restaurant inside looks far too expensive for what you get, but the express booth outside will do just fine.  Clearly the most popular item here are these frozen hot chocolates, which is mostly an iced chocolate smoothie to soothe your dehydrated self.

It'll set you back about $10, but I'd say it's worth it!  The chocolate goodness of the drink definitely cools you down, at least long enough for you to head into one of the air conditioned casinos.  Don't forget to also order a side of fries.  Ice cream goes SO well with frozen desserts such as this, and you can't hate it til you've tried it.

The only gripe I have about Serendipity's express-lane is that it's also another contradiction... the wait is LONG!  You're looking at a 30 minute wait as it is before getting your order in, even when the line seems short.  Then you're expected to wait another 10-15 minutes before the actual drink comes out.  A bit ridiculous if you ask me.

But despite it all, I'm sure I'll be sipping on another one of these again soon.  Note for next time- grab some kahlua or bailey's and mix it into the drink.  Get twice the fun!",2,2,2

It's a great place to enjoy a nice meal with whoever you're with and relive the previous night's shenanigans (or try to) over some good food and delicious desserts or Frozzennn Hot Chocolate.

Their prices are kind of steep, but their portions are huge so you can definitely share your dishes. I actually recommend doing this so that way you'll have room at the end for the best part - dessert!

I don't remember the exact names, but we got their Turkey Sandwich with apples or cranberries.....something fruity.... and the Brie Burger, and both were delish!

I checked in for my reservation 40 min early, she told me our table would be ready in 15 minutes. It was exactly ready in the given estimate time. I had a great day, the hostess was friendly, the restaurant is cute, and I was looking forward to trying the sundae for the first time ever. Upset to say it was ruined by an
extremely rude server, Izzy. Perhaps it was the fact that I ordered water instead of a drink that it made him think I wasn't a ""worthy"" guest? Or was it also because I requested my dessert first, the cowardly portion($16 versus the $24 for a full-size)? Or, is the initial reason behind your sour attitude towards us because I requested a booth for a party of 2 when you could've been sat a table of 4?

First off, I ordered water because I've been walking around Vegas all day in the 106 degree weather. Secondly, I requested my dessert first because I've always wanted to try Serendipity 3 for their sundaes (I wanted to make sure I had room for my dessert over my dinner). When I placed my dessert request, I specifically told him I'm going to order dinner after this. His attitude to that was whatever. I shook it off; I didn't mind his doubt because it does sound like an excuse. That was my first hint. The second hint was when he rudely dropped off my sundae- not one glance at us, i heard the thud on the table, didn't even bother to ask if I was ready to order dinner. Okay, that's fine... Maybe he was busy. Now this is the part that infuriated me: he checked on his other table, cleared their dishes, made sure they didn't need anything else, didn't even bother to stop by, left somewhere, and another server stopped by to announce that she was his ""break"" server. Needless to say, my mood went sour, my appetite was ruined because at this point, it was now obvious he didn't give a sh*t about us.

It's a very cute sundae parlor atmosphere with friendly servers (e.g. His ""break"" server) which had the potential of a great experience.... I wish I had his ""break"" server or any other server with a better attitude than what Izzy had treated me and my sister just because we had water, sat in his booth, and ordered our dessert first.",0,0,0

Service: Hostess - Seemed tired, overworked.. not so cheery. When asked which frozen hot chocolate she recommended, her response lacked any interest and service. Not impressed at all.

Food: Ordered the regular frozen hot chocolate. Not a sweet tooth kind of person. So it was a bit overrated in my opinion. Tastes like a melted super rich chocolate malt that you will need to workout for the next 5 days to burn those crazy calories. If you like that sort of dessert, then go for it. 

Also ordered the Thai Beef Salad. DO NOT ORDER THIS. 

for $17 you get the cheap cabbage\/lettuce, 4-5 tiny slices of fatty beef, and tons of fried noodles and other colorful garnish on the plate. 

My overall recommendation... is just go get some regular RIte Aid ice cream and take a picture of the place. For the ridiculous cost of the items of the menu and the half decent service.. this place has a lot to learn about maintaining the quality and standards of a notable establishment.

Before coming to Serendipity, I didn't even imagine this would be on the menu. I only had my mind on the frozen hot chocolate. But doubt me not, the fried chicken here was OFF THE CHARTS.

When arriving, it may be a bit confusing to navigate but it's tucked away on the outside of Ceasar's Palace. They have a to-go window with a separate menu, and if you keep walking past that window, you'll see the entrance to the restaurant. 

I came here on a Tuesday night around 8pm and there was a fifteen minute wait for 2 people. You give them your phone number and they'll text you when the table is ready. They give you five minutes from the time they send the text, so you can easily roam around the courtyard outside and come back in time.

The portions here are HUGE, and that is not an overstatement. We ordered the fried chicken to share, which came with mashed potatoes and gravy. I could have done without the gravy, because the mashed potatoes and fried chicken alone were the best combination. AH-MA-ZING. For something as simple as fried chicken to make such a large impression on me is surprising. Needless to say, I'll definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas just for this.

Now for dessert - The Frozen Hot Chocolate was phenomenal and definitely lives up to the hype! Order to share, you won't finish it all (unless it's the only thing you order, then go for it!)

I came with a group of about 10 and we waited for about 2 hours. We had to wait outside in the super hot nevada weather but luckily there were huge tents and misters around, but it was still incredibly hot. While we were waiting, my sister got a peanut butter frozen hot chocolate and it was delicious! Quite pricey, but it was worth it. When we finally did get into the restaurant, I ordered the steak and egg sandwich, again very pricey. I have to admit that the sandwich itself was not THAT great. The yolk from the egg was in that kind of coagulated state where it's not really runny and not really solidified either. Also, the skirt steak was a bit dry for my liking. The size of it was really large though. My mom ordered an almond frozen hot chocolate, with my suggestion, and it was not nearly as good as my sister's. The almond one was like little bits of ice floating around in a slight almond flavor with whipped cream and almonds on top. Not the kind of sensation I would expect for an $8-$10 signature drink. Overall I would say my experience here was okay and I guess we had to come here to say we tried it. Hopefully my next trip here will be up to par with what everyone raves about!",0,0,0

The food was incredibly heavy and honestly, didn't feel much better than your local Olive Garden\/Cheesecake Factory. This place is kind of crowded, especially on weekends and you definitely have to make reservation at least a day ahead of time (don't know why, nothing so great here).

The service was also very odd. Our waitress changed her attitude very clearly after we decided to not order alcoholic drinks. Not only that, she was serving a table next to us and she was definitely speaking to them inappropriately about something, telling the other table that they should not be doing certain things due to the fact that she will get in trouble for it (waiters should not be saying this to customers). She also went into a long-winded story with them about how she got into trouble. She spoke incredibly loudly and even in the loud restaurant, I could hear her from when she was serving the other table near us. This definitely made us feel very uncomfortable there.

Probably won't come back again, since there's plenty of other awesome restaurants in Vegas.",2,0,0

We shared the Frozen Hot Chocolate. It was good, not great. Slightly watered down, but it did have that chocolatey overtone.

To be perfectly honest, I've enjoyed a more full-flavored beverage at Starbucks or the Coffee Bean.

Our waitress could have had more of a personality or perhaps practiced a little more on that fake smile to be more genuine-looking. She was a little rushed & not personable.

Although I do have to say that the 2 gals I dealt with at the front counter were excellent in getting our party of 5 seated in 5 mins instead of the 30 mins we were told to begin with. At a 114 degree weather today we probably could've gone for inside seating, but THAT probably would have been the 30 min wait. The fan misters were OK if you were directly in its path. 

Our drinks came out fairly quick, along with the baby's kid meal which were the 2 burger sliders that could have easily been devoured in one bite by any starved adult--they were so microscopic! I guess perfect for a child of 21 months.

Thai Salad was pretty good, the Nachos appetizer @ $14 was shabby, only thing good about it was the condiments it came with:  sour cream, real guacamole & fresh salsa. The Buffalo Wings were nothing special, just your ordinary batch that came with sticks of carrots & celery & ranch dressing.

What wowed me was the White Cholocate Frozen Hot Chocolate. I think we got gipped because we ordered a Large to share, but it looked exactly like a Regular single serving of the Oreo Frozen that someone in my party ordered. Banana Split, I was told, was good, along with the Caramel Sundae that someone else got.

All in all, this is not a place to go if youre Starvin Marvin for food, but I wasn't let down w\/my dessert choice since I am a true White Choco lover.

Bacon Cheeseburger, fries and soda. 
The price of $16.22 is fair considering it is Las Vegas.

All food is cooked to order. The burger was cooked fine.  The bacon tasted like it was in a prep pan for hours.  I have worked in a hotels and kitchens for almost 30 years and I know lame bacon when I taste it.

The fries were the highlight of the meal. 

The order taker was pleasant and efficient.  'Wait for your soda ... your number will be called at the other window ... thank you'.   Again ... pleasant.

Major issue: The customers can see into the kitchen and service areas.  You can see when your order is complete.  You can see your order sit under the heat lamp while the girl expediting and making drinks is TEXTING!  My number was called and my order was placed on the counter.

We couldn't leave without trying the world famous frozen hot chocolate. We went with the original flavor. Let me warn you, this thing is HUGE! Definitely share with a friend.

This place lives up to it's hype! The room is just dazzled with pink galore.  A really awesome place for family, couples, and friends.

It is super expensive! I literally spent like $15 for a cheeseburger, which i will post a pic of! Although it is sad that the cheeseburger is $15, it was heavenly. That was probably the best burger i had in awhile, juicy, cheesy cheddar that'll drive you mad, the bun, oh the bun was buttery and crunchy at the edges (ya know cuz of tha butta), but soft and fluffy around the center. my mouth is salivating as we speak. 

so you can go there for the yummy sweets, as well as the burger haha. we got the frozen hot chocolate by the way.

Then I went there recently and got an oreo frozen hot chocolate to go. It was so good, I was somewhat drunk.

You're probably thinking that the change in opinions was due to intoxication but I had tried the frozen hot chocolate side by side next to the oreo version when we got it to go and still felt indifferent toward the original frozen hot chocolate. I mean it was good like how chocolate is good but it wasn't great. The oreo frozen hot chocolate was amazing. It really depends on your tastebuds because one of the girls tried the oreo frozen hot chocolate, thought it was too sweet, and liked the original frozen hot chocolate flavor better.

In any case, the desseerts were pretty good. Service could have been better, therefore the one star docked. We didnt get the bill in a while and we had to flag someone down to get it. Cmon now, it's Vegas, we got people to see, places to go, Money to ......... win!

I would go there again. Probably try another type of sundae.

Its a restaurant that has a to go section outside for customers who don't want to dine in. The décor is very 50's cute diner with a Greek twist on the outside.

When your inside you can even find the movie poster to the movies Serendipity. This time around visiting I took time to get some quick pictures of what everyone at my table was having. My cousin got a burger and some fries and I decided to share meals with my boyfriend and sister. I chose sweet potatoes fries, chicken Alfredo pasta and a BBQ chicken pizza on a flatbread. The sweet potatoes friends were delicious but I was not a fan of the dipping sauce they had along with it. The dipping sauce was chipotle with melted marshmallow, honestly all you can taste is the marshmallow and that I wasn't into much. I have to be honest and tell you that I cannot tell you how that burger taste because it was my cousins but I CAN Tell you that he did finish it all. The pasta was really good I love that the noodles were covered in sauce and that there were big pieces of chicken and broccoli. After a couple bites though, it became very heavy for me to handle and I got full to quick. Also, I didn't have the pizza but the last time I was there I had the same kind and it was great as well.

I always leave happy, full and sad only because I get so full that I can't try the famous frozen hot chocolate. Maybe on my next trip? What do you think.",0,0,0

I very much liked my server, Jeff, who was so much more friendly and attentive than the first time we came here. 
We ordered some onion rings for an appetizer, which looked fabulous, but were undercooked and doughy in the middle, so we sent them back. 
I did really enjoy the meat lovers pizza, suggested by Jeff. He said it was all house made, and you could tell. It was on a thin crust, with lots of cheese and different Italian meats. The flavor was pretty good. I took the leftovers home, because it was a lot for 1 person. 
My friend ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich, which she said was not very good. She said it was dry and the cole slaw had no flavor, but my pizza was good. Seems like their food is hit or miss. Some things yummy, others not so much.

The desserts were HUGE! We all split desserts, and with two people on each one, we still had a lot of trouble finishing any of them.

- Frozen hot chocolate (3\/5 stars): My cousin asked, ""how do you freeze a hot chocolate?"" I had to second guess that & said it's just hot chocolate & you freeze it. LOL! Just hearing the concept of it is interesting. There was a time they were selling MINT frozen hot chocolate but it's no longer on the menu. That was good.

- Peanut Butter frozen hot chocolate (4\/5 stars): There is no chocolate in this, it's just listed under their frozen hot chocolate list. I love my peanut butter & this was good for a hot day in Vegas!

- Oreo frozen hot chocolate (3\/5 stars): For some reason this tasted like cake batter to me. It was good, but didn't taste like oreo.

If I remember right theres only 3 locations worldwide and lucky for Las Vegas, one is here. Located on the grounds of Caesar's Palace. A stand alone building that can easily be seen from the street. It sits on the corner of LV Blvd & Flamingo. If you feel like indulging yourself, look up their $1000 sundae(yes 1000, not a typo). For all us mortal folk, they have a regular menu to satisfy our gustatory needs. The location has a very hip & trendy feel, not a very large dining room so the wait can be killer at times, especially for larger groups. If you're fortunate enough to have someone with a Harrah's loyalty card, Total Rewards Diamond or 7star card, your party can get priority seating. If not for that on all my visits I don't think I could have waited 30min plus sometimes just to get seated. I believe they do take reservations but don't quote me on that.
Service has always been good, even when we had problems. One visit, my fries tasted like they were dunked in salt. Our waitress apologized and quickly had a fresh batch brought out.  Their signature frozen hot chocolate is crazy good. A must try at least once if one is a fan of chocolate! The menu has a wide variety of foods from burgers, entrees and a selection of desserts.  Prices are on par with similar eateries on the strip in Vegas(excluding that insane sundae). Some of their items I've tried weren't the greatest and some were good.

We ordered the two person size Oreo frozen hot chocolate for $15. It is refreshing and delicious without being overly sweet (consider the mount of whipped cream on top). I still don't get the ""hot"" part but for a desert, it is very satisfying!

I ordered my frozen hot chocolate to go, which could have been mistake number one, but I was not trying to stand in the heat for 35 minutes for a table when all I wanted was to try the frozen hot chocolate. 

I ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two and only waited about 5 minutes before a huge, frothy, behemoth of a frozen drink was placed in my hands. Here's the thing: it was delicious. It's far more spectacular than a Wendy's frosty (yes, I'm making the comparison... and you'll see why soon). A friend of a friend went once and complained that she paid $12 for a big frosty. Well, she's wrong on that count. At first taste, you can tell immediately that the chocolate is special. It's quality and it's generously used throughout. However, it's so quality that all I needed was a sip. The same went for my boyfriend. So, really, a ""for two"" should have been two shot glasses. It was THAT rich. 

I don't know if I'll ever order this again, I spent $20 for two sips and left the rest sitting at  Caesar's Palace slot machine for some hungry freegan to find their own ""jackpot"" but it was worth tasting.",2,2,1

I wish that were true, but I seem to have the memories of our Brunch at Serendipity. Our group of 4 guys arrived around noon for...brunch I guess. At least it was brunch time. There wasn't a wait for a table even though we wanted to be seated inside. We were ready to order pretty quickly, but it took our waitress quite a long while to collect our drink order (which was 3 waters and a coffee). Once we finally ordered, two of us settled on Omelets and two went with sandwiches. Then the wait began again.
 
About 20 minutes later, the food finally arrived. The omelets were normal size, but very plain. The omelet was very dry, as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while (trust me, it was Vegas in July, I knew the feeling of sitting under a heat lamp).
 
My cup of fruit was not quite a full measuring cup size, but it did have fresh berries and melons, which was nice. I'm told the sandwiches were quite good and obnoxiously large. One friend ordered the steak and eggs which turned out to be about a pound of steak, an 18"" hoagie, 3 fried eggs, and bacon.
 
When we finished our meal, we looked around for the waitress. Then we waited. Then we waited. Then we waited. Then we waited. You get the point. Then she finally came and told us she would bring the check. Then we waited. Then we waited. Finally we got the check and continued in our waiting pattern for her to come back for our cards, run them, and bring our cards back.

We came here for dinner on our final full day of Vegas. My friend wanted to go here because she loves their frozen hot chocolates. It was only about a five minute walk from our hotel (The Flamingo). When we put our name down, the hostess told us we'd have to wait around 20-25 minutes for a table, even though there were empty tables and no wait list at the time. Weirdly, exactly 25 minutes passed when we received our text that our table was ready. We went in and were seated at the table (that was definitely empty when we first went in). 

My BF and I were Kind of sugared out at this point in our Vegas trip so we decided not to get the hot chocolate. He got a pizza and I got the Ahi Tuna salad because I wanted something light. When the did cane out, evening looked great. The color contrast and arrangement of my salad was beautiful. On closer inspection though, I noticed that the tuna was a lot redder than most so that I've seen. I brushed it off and we all dug in.

Zthe fist but was not bad, but as I ate more of my salad it tasted worse and worse. I started to notice an overly fishy taste to the ahi, and the sauce that was both on the side and drizzled all over the salad got more and more overwhelmingly sweet. In the end, I couldn't even finish it because it was so drenched in sweet sauce. My BF was also having trouble eating his pizza, and he's the type that always eats everything. He couldn't handle the overwhelming amount of cheese on his pizza (equal parts cheese and crust) and ending up just eating the toppings.

We ordered the tower of onion rings which came with a bbq sauce dip and some ranch. The rings are coated in garlic and parmesan cheese (very good!) and our lunch was the mac and cheese with pancetta and a bacon cheeseburger for the husband.

He enjoyed his burger but my mac and cheese was entirely too rich. Truffle oil is used liberally and while excellent I would recommend to share the dish. It's too much for one person.

I stood in a short line to put our name on a waiting list. The lady told me it would be about 30 minutes. It didn't seem like a long time to wait at first.

I looked in the restaurant to see mostly four tops. I noticed about 5 more four tops were seated before us. That's when I asked to speak with a manager. I asked him why all these four tops were seated ahead of us. He said there were only a few tables that accommodated more than four. It was against company policy to move tables around due to fire hazards. What??? I've never heard something so ridiculous before. They then told us our table was almost ready.

Price: For the 3 of us, the total was $50-something including tax and tip.

Spinach\/Artichoke dip - serious yum with huge pieces of shaved parm on top, my mom adored this 
3 cheese omelet with waffle fries - oomg FLUFFIEST OMELET EVER!!! It was seriously huge, I'm thinking..maybe 6 eggs went into it? It was soft, fluffy, filled with goooey cheese and was seriously.. perfect! 
Vanilla\/coffee hot fudge sundae - my sister's choice, it was good as far as sundae's go, but.. $14 for ice cream and chocolate sauce? ummm... 
Frozen hot chocolate - Ok.. so $11 for basically... chocolate milk blended with ice and a load of whipped cream on top, and don't get me wrong, it was rich, creamy and delish! I drank nearly the entire thing and it was great for a 1 time thing to do. But really.. i was.. i dunno, underwhelmed? 

Parking: ride the deuce baby!! 

Would I Come Back: yes and i want the omelet when i do! seriously, yummiest omelet ever!

She kindly informed me that Serendipity3 has opened up at Caesar's and I suggested that we go there to rekindle memories of the original in NYC (well, at least before they got busted for rats\/rodents\/whatever).

I may not be a local, but I sure have been to LV plenty of times (at least a dozen).  I always thought that service is excellent in LV, especially at higher-end places (and I would imagine that Caesar's falls into one of them).  Serendipity3 managed to break my bubble in this respect.

But you know, maybe that's because this place is actually not in Caesar's.  It's outside in a ""box"", as my friend described it.  Aside from the menu, the place doesn't really do a good job in copying the original.  While the dessert we had (frozen hot chocolate, of course) was delicious, everything else was... blah.

We decided to sit at the bar counter because we didn't want to wait.  It didn't matter because I like sitting at the bar anyway.  I couldn't help but observe these two things while I was there:

#1.  I sat at the end of the bar where the staff would place the frozen hot chocolate (or any other items) that are ready to be delivered to the guests.  I have to tell you... they sat there really, really, really long time.  They pushed the food so close to me that I probably accidently spit in some of them while talking.  Sorry!

#2.  Bartender actually made a wrong drink for one of the guests!  Now, you would think that they would toss that one out and make a new correct one.  What did they do instead?  They fudged that wrong drink by adding some elements (juice or whatever) to make it look like the one that the guest ordered.  How do I know all this?  Because they actually conversed loudly enough for me to hear it.

I thought about giving 1 star, but just for the original sake, I am giving this a 2.",2,0,0

Here are some of the stuff off the menu that were ordered:

Frozen hot chocolate - very chocolatey and refreshing, kinda on the slushy side instead of the creamy side

Deep fried oreo (sundae) -  the waitress told us its not actually deep fried, but the oreos taste cripy and oh so good (drool).  the oreos are topped with scoops of ice cream and whip cream and so so yummy!

Chocolate cake (sundae) - woos n ahhhs r the first reactions for everyone at the table! a giant slice of rich chocolate cake on top of scoops of chocolate ice cream and topped with lots of fresh whip cream.  a very visual and tasty dessert

Strawberry cheese cake (sundae) - i didnt get to taste this one but it looks gorgeous, looks kinda like the chocolate cake sundae with a generous slice of cheese cake, topped with fresh whip cream and strawberries, and all that sitting on freshly made strawberry ice cream

Popcorn shrimp - that actually comes with handfuls of popcorn as a side, super fun

Spinach dip and chips - nothing special, and the dip is a bit on the greasy side

Caesar chicken salad - somebody at the table said its the best caesar salad they've ever had!  bed of greens tossed in caesar dressing, topped with giant 2"" cubes of garlic crutons that are both soft and crunchy, and just the right amount of chicken strips, perfection!

Salmon nice salad - such a wonderful and fulfilling salad with all the yummy ingredients, generous portion of grilled salmon, handful of olives, string beans, fingerling potato coins, sundried tomatoes and red bellpepper, all dressed in a tangy dress. yummalicious!

Asian chicken salad - beautifully presented, lots of chicken and chopped greens tossed in asian sweet dressing.  served with chopsticks and a fortune cookie.  very fun!

Some kind of steak sandwich (not sure about the name) - served with side of fried, this sandwich is served on a footlong french roll filled with large pieces of steak, topped with lots of cripy bacons, then topped with 3 sunny side up eggs!  I didnt get to taste it, but the friend who ordered it said its soooooo gooood.  good enough for me!

If you've been to Hash House a Go Go on the west side, this place to me is like the dessert\/super casual version of it.  The portions are big, and seriously should be shared for anyone watching what they're eating (i.e. me).  

Such a fun place, I highly recommanded especially when the weather is nice outdoor, you get to sit right on the Strip!  One concern is that the food kinda takes a while to get to the table, but its definitely worth the wait in my opinion =)",5,3,3

Since I do not like Las Vegas's hot or cold weather, I would suggest to request to sit inside. They usually overshoot the estimated time that they would tell you you would have to wait, and fifteen minutes was actually just five minutes. 

Fronting the restaurant is a Thai Buddhist shrine. It was unusual as I was in the mood of the Caesar's Palace hotel and did not expect to see that.

If you are commuting there by car and not walking there, there are many parking - valet and\/or self-park - option as Serendipity 3 is at the corner of a street on the Vegas Strip. 

Now, for the most important part... The FOOD! 

The Yums:
- Fries: They were surprisingly amazing! It's normal fries, but it was salted well and had a great enough crunch and my friends and I ordered it after we ate our food and ended up eating it all.
- Crab Cake Salad: I did not to expect to see seafood at Serendipity 3. What a surprise it was. It was so good that my best friend who ordered it did not speak a single word from the time she got her food until she finished it whole
- Foot Long Chili Hot Dog: I felt like a mother who made enough food to portion with her children and herself. I was able to fill my tummy up and giving three parts of my foot long hot dog to three friends. It wasn't too thick too eat, which was good. Add a bit of hot sauce, and it's perfect!
- Nachos (appetizer): I would not have mind if the nachos were my meal. It was so yummy! It looked a bit sparse in the chip count, but it was big enough to satisfy eight tummies.
- Frozen Hot Chocolate: The Frozen Hot Chocolates that we got were Oreo, Regular, and Mocchachino. All were yummy, but the best was the Mocchacino, hands down.

All in all, I wish I had the Frozen Hot Chocolate first - or that was the only thing we ate - because we were too too full. We couldn't make it into Caesar's Palace for five minutes until have to go to the restroom. Oops TMI? :P",5,0,1

It felt like a storybook place and the famed Frozen Hot Chocolate was scrumptious. 

So when Serendipity 3 opened in Vegas, I was thrilled. I've been here a few times. The decor is over the top as is most things on the Strip. It's a bit much for me but it's heaven for little girls. The Frozen Hot Chocolate here is nowhere as good as the one I had in New York. It tastes very powdery and I was just not impressed. I do love their alcoholic drinks, especially the Berry Mojito. 

My favorites there are: 

-Mac & Cheese: a calorie-loaded treat that's worth the guilty feeling afterwards 
-Potato Skins: I am so addicted to these! The chef puts some kind powder on the outside of the skins and it just tastes delicious. I just wish they had jalapeno peppers which are my favorite item on potato skins

We had made reservations about a month ahead of time, but as it turned out we would have been fine without them as it didn't start getting busy until we were leaving. We also went around 7PM on a Thursday, so on weekends I am sure it is a different story.

I got the mac and cheese and just couldn't eat enough of it, everything about the food was delicious and each bite was better than the last.
I was actually not a fan of the frozen hot chocolate, but to be fair I am not a big chocolate person, but everyone else in my group adored it.

Went on Christmas Eve for lunch at 12pm with my mom and my friend

- Service: Hostesses were stuck up. However, they did do their job. Their told us it would be a 20 min wait and it was about a 20 min wait. When we came back we got seated. So can't complain too much. Our waitress was pretty bad. It took her forever to come greet us and asks if we wanted any drinks - only to realize that the hostess forgot to give us food menus and only gave us the menus for the alcoholic drinks. My mom ordered hot tea and it took her 2 trips back to remember to give it to her. It wasn't even that busy when we went. Since my mom and I were sharing a meal, she told us she'd come back with extra plates. ""Oh, well that's good..."" I thought. Nope, she came back with plates - dirty plates. ""Whoops,"" she said, ""let me get you cleaner ones."" Came back and the ""cleaner"" ones still had some dry food stuck on it.

- Food: I ordered the Las Vegas steak strip sandwich... the size of it was fantastic BUT the taste was very mediocre and quite bland. The worst part was that it was super oily. I ate about 1\/5 of the sandwich and got full due to the greasiness of it. Got pretty nausceous for the next few hours and didn't get hungry again until midnight. That's pretty bad. The sweet potato fries were okay. The frozen hot chocolate was worse than the NY one because the cup was pretty much 1\/4 frozen hot chocolate and 3\/4 whipped cream.

Not sure why I keep going, maybe it's for the convenience of being around Caesars, PH, and Quad which we often stay at.  The table service is always really slow.  If you want to get seated quickly, you can go to one of the two bars, inside and outside, but you may still have to wait a while either for your server to get to you or for your food to come out.  

What I do enjoy about Serendipity 3 is the ambiance outdoors.  While you eat, you get to people watch on the strip; kind of gives that full Vegas experience.

I don't know what is is about me that I always order the $30 steak and egg sandwich.  You can't really go wrong with it, but then again, there has to be other things that are good on the menu.  I almost always never eat the bread; I might as well go somewhere else for steak and eggs.  The menu is really just two full pages, so you are not really left with much selection; that entree seems to be the best sounding one.

We also ordered the pulled pork on a pretzel bun this time around.  I was a fan of the description, but not a fan of the entree when it finally came out.  Although the bun was decent, the sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking.

For the steak and egg sandwich and pulled pork on a pretzel bun, the total came out to about $70.  Good thing we didn't order alcohol!  It's Vegas, everything at the hotels or on the strip are overpriced for not that great a value.  I go to Vegas so much; next time, I need to be more of a local.",3,2,2

If you're not in the waiting mood, they also have a pick up window outside though I'm not sure how that was as I didn't use it...I just gave myself a reason to go back now.

Prices here aren't half bad and the food is pretty good (just a little better than average portions in my opinion) with tasty Ice Cream (just ask my son). Well, not half bad when it comes to Vegas prices that is as I am sure there are pricier places on the strip to eat.

The hype of the frozen hot chocolate did not disappoint, although I would have appreciated the price of this delectable drink to be a little bit cheaper. At $11 dollars (without toppings) a single serving it easily could be shared between 2 people (just fyi!). The first night I tried the regular frozen hot chocolate and the 2nd night I tried the white chocolate frozen hot chocolate. BOTH were yummy! The shaved chocolate inside the drink was a great touch and provided nice texture to the drink! Albeit, the drink is basically cold chocolate milk... it still tasted amazing!

The mac and cheese was DELICIOUS. Portions were on the larger side, which was great (it better be, because tht was some $14 mac and cheese!). We tried the crab artichoke dip, which tastes yummy too!! It had a hint of spice in it! Wasn't really a big fan of the ABC (Avocado, Brie and Caramlized Onion) burger. The taste was okay, but what really put me off was that the burger was sooo tall that it was almost impossible to eat! Well, possible if you wanted to get messy!

Get there early, because seating could be tricky! And if you went to Vegas during winter like I did, I'd opt to stay inside because it was freezing outside. Although, they did have those space heaters, I still would be cold.

They don't always have the outside seating available, which is so dumb - it just increases the wait time. The food is good but it's doggone expensive. I got four sliders the size of Susan B.

We were seated right away (it was a Wednesday afternoon), which was a plus. We were seated by a heat lamp, which was also a plus because it wasn't exactly super warm outside. There were, however, these crazy birds swooping around the tables. There's gotta be something unsanitary about that, right? Some sort of health code violation? Not sure how to prevent that, maybe just better cleanup of the food that dumb children (or dumb adults, let's be honest) might have thrown on the ground for them.

As for the food, it is hard to find anything on the menu under 12 bucks. Even appetizers. I opted for the 16 dollar burger which was cooked exactly the way I wanted it, medium rare (plus!). While both burger and fries were good, they were not worth 16 bucks and were certainly not anything I would rave about. Dessert = also expensive. My boyfriend and I split a simple sundae with butterscotch and hot fudge. Tasty...but not 13-14 dollar tasty.

His first words to me were ""Oh, are you here by yourself?!"" He was apologetic and said he was just sure I was waiting for someone. Finally, he said he'd be my date for the night.

I love banter, and normally this would have been great, but something upset me about him constantly insinuating that there was something wrong with me for eating alone. Surely that can't be that uncommon in Vegas.

My dinner was lackluster. I ordered a chicken and pasta dish and was not even remotely impressed. This is not to say it was bad by any means! I just expected it to taste better than the Olive Garden. I understand this is a restaurant geared towards dessert, so that's fine. 

I had a drink called something like ""Alcoholic Girl Scout Cookie"" and it was good. I never would have guessed that there was alcohol in it, because I couldn't taste it and it did nothing for me. Oh well.

I remember dessert being fine. Nothing that wowed me, as I can't even remember what I had.

I imagined this place to be huge, but it's actually kind of small inside. We only waited 15 minutes for a table inside and even there it was scorching hot sitting inside. My bf and I wanted to try everything on their menu, but decided not to over indulge so much. We ended up sharing a frozen hot chocolate to join the bandwagon of reviews AND their strawberry shortcake sundae. The frozen chocolate hits the spot if you're a chocolate lover on a hot day, but nothing too crazy. The strawberry shortcake sundae on the other hand, was massive! The cheesecake in the sundae made it too rich to eat the sundae in my opinion. I like cheesecake and I like strawberry shortcake, but together? Too intense. Too overwhelmed by the sugar overload, I didn't even notice it when I left my atm card behind after paying for our desserts. =\/",1,1,1

We were told it was 35 minute wait - no biggie.  We waited for an outdoor table on a beautiful afternoon - 12:30 pm on Monday (4\/09).  

We got seated About 45 minutes later at a great table facing the boulevard.  For such a long wait I wasn't sure why their were multiple empty tables outside.  This place could turn over much more money if they filled them.  Their profit isn't my problem though.  We soon figured out why the tables weren't full.  They were most likely severely short staffed.  Although, since there were three hostesses to seat, one wouldn't have assumed so.  

We sat and sat and sat. No acknowledgement.  No water.  No ""I'll be right with you"".  20 minutes and nothing.  Not a word.  Perhaps, they thought the view was enough.  One waitress passed us and we tried to get her attention, but she looked in the opposite direction as she passed.  So, 20 minutes going onto 25 minutes and this is added to the 45 min wait for a table.  We ended up walking out.  Why are we going to pay our hard earned dollars for food plus tip when there was a clear problem here.  
Who knows how long the food would have taken to arrive.  

We went elsewhere and then came back for that frozen hot chocolate to-go.  The short, it wasn't anything special.  It was good.  But we truly are the dummies for paying an absurd ($15) amount for a humdrum to-go milkshake.

First, we should have made a reservation (not even sure that is possible).  We waited one hour to be seated.  The restaurant was not seating people in the side patio when we arrived, but began doing so immediately before seating us.  The music was extremely loud.  I asked that it be turned down and was told that because the kitchen was ""open"" they couldn't hear it.  I stated that I believed the patrons should be accomodated, not the kitchen staff (sorry everyone - I know you work very hard, but it should be pleasant for those of us eating and paying the bill).  The music volume changed twice while we were there - down, up, (complained again), then down again.

Second, we waited for 35 minutes for the breakfast which consists of a long thick piece of bread - nothing special, not flavored or seasoned that I could tell, was supposed to have 4 slices of bacon, but only had 3 1\/3!.  In addition, the server started to pick up the plate from her tray and dropped 1\/3 of the whipped cream on the tray.  She did not offer nor did she bring more to replace it.  The maple syrup is enough for a normal sized french toast and should have been more - the server never returned in time to request more.  The berries were fresh.  The worst, however, was the so-called ""sunnyside-up"" eggs.  Yes, the sunnyside was up, but the eggs were completely cooked through and rubbery - I had to use a knife to saw through the edges - the worst eggs I have ever had in a restaurant! Finally, I ordered the cappucinno. I should have gone to Starbucks!  It was in a very small cup and while tasty, was not satisfying - for the price it should have been twice the amount of coffee. The restaurant does not refill coffee. They brought my husband a large mugof coffee and that was all he got for his ""bottomless coffee.",0,0,0

I went to Serendipity twice in one trip so, that says something. My initial visit was to meet fellow Yelper, Michael U. We ordered the strawberry balsamic waffle and the hot chocolate french toast. Then, we complete the meal with carrot cake! 

Of the three, my favorite was the strawberry balsamic waffle. The waffles were fresh, tender, and had some good malt flavor that I love. The balsamic syrup was a prefect compliment to the fresh berries and cream. It required no additional syrup, which should tell you it was REALLY good because I usually drown everything in syrup at breakfast.

The hot chocolate french toast had potential, but the bread was cut SO thick that the custard was unable to penetrate the entire slice of bread leaving a very dry piece of stale hot chocolate bread. Not ideal, however, about 1\/3 of the dish was very good.

The carrot cake was pretty standard in my book. Very dense, lots of gooey cream cheese icing, served cold, sundae style with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. A solid carrot cake!

My next visit was two mornings later with my boyfriend, who missed the breakfast with Michael U. due to the previous night's outing. He ordered the huevos rancheros and I had the sinners and saints french toast. The huevos rancheros were Napolian stack style and just OK. A little greasy from the chorizo with a basic green sauce. The Saints and sinner french toast was nothing like I'd imagined and was so good! One side is savory with an over easy egg and bacon, the other side is sweet with berries and whipped cream served with supper crispy 'breakfast potatoes'. I enjoyed both sides of this super moist, buttery french toast with syrup and ate as much as I could leaving the untopped middle for the birds (figuratively).

Service both times was efficient, but not memorable. The staff doesn't seem to be overly passionate about service. However, it sufficed, and both times we didn't have to wait for a seat and only had to wait for refills on one occasion during each sitting. I've had worse service for sure. 

Prices are on par with other restaurants in the area. Think: resort pricing.

Wow we had a great time. My kids were entertained by Kyle our happy and friendly server. We ordered the Empire State Onion Ring Tower to start - it came sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and two dipping sauces.

My wife then ordered the Serendipity Chicken Salad - the ""signature"" salad - dressing on the side because it is very saucy. I ordered the chicken pot pie, and the kids ordered a $15 (about a dollar an inch) hot dog to split. It was all very good. My son was psyched when Kyle delivered the relish tray with 5 different toppings and sauces. 

The Salad - crunchy and fresh with red and yellow grape tomatoes, hearts of palm, chicken, and fresh corn cut from the cob. 5 Stars - very large and good enough to eat without the salad dressing.

The chicken pot pie. It was hot and fresh. The pie shell was cooked to perfection and fluffy. It was filled with large chunks of chicken, peas, carrots, and potatoes. Very tasty - 4 stars.... a little small - put good for the health conscious that don't want the ""hungry man"" portions.

The hot dog was a long as my son's whole arm. He loved it and dug into the relish and onion toppings. My daughter loved her portion of the hot dog as well. The homemade bun was toasted perfectly - and the hot dog was all beef with no mystery meat. I tried a bite and was very impressed. 4.5 stars.

On to dessert - first the New York Brownie Sundae - excellent and divine with a huge three layer fudge cake in the middle of an huge scoop of chocolate ice cream. 5 Stars. 

The Double Frozzzen Hot Chocolate - it lived up to the hype - it was really good and came with 4 straws. My kids loved the whipped cream and the frozen chocolate goodness. 5+ Stars.

Overall the bill was a little less than 100 - with a 20% tip for our excellent waiter.

In conclusion - great service, great food, great atmosphere. It was worth the wait and the price. For those of you with ""Baskin and Robbins"" comments - those are in the food court at the outlet mall and  in every town in America - splurge a little it's VEGAS! Save the $1 Whopper and a water budget or 1.49 Big Gulp \/ Big Bite combo adventure for your own home town.

P.S. - the high prices keep out the ""riff raff"" - which makes a more pleasant dining experience.",5,4,2

They only have 2 kinds - glazed and chocolate.  They were out of glazed during this visit so we had chocolate.

(-)
- overpriced
- too much hype
- long wait

Me and my friend dropped by around 1230-1pm friday to try the frozen hot chocolate. There was a 20 minute wait (also a faster to go counter outside for those who didn't want to wait) which sucked since the place didn't live up to expectations.

We split the frozen hot chocolate for two which was brought to us quickly. It wasn't bad but I thought it was waaay too sweet. And for 15 bucks? so not worth it. A better bet would probably be a sundae, those are also overpriced for what little you get but at least you'll get something that probably tastes better.

I went back to Vegas a year later and still didn't get one! So about a month ago I made a reservation for Easter weekend and finally satisfied my craving\/curiosity. I decided to get the smaller size of mint chocolate in a to go cup and could not finish it by myself! Delicious but definitely sweet. It tasted just like I thought it would but was a bit runnier than I expected; it's easier to sip it through the straws rather than use a spoon while walking. My friends' green tea one didn't resemble green tea at all, it was just over sugared. 

I arrived fifteen minutes early for my six person reservation at 5pm. I ended up changing it for three and we were seated under the burning sun, so we asked our waiter, Jason, if we could move to the one under some umbrellas. He quickly cleaned up the table and we ended up ordering an Asian chicken salad, ahi tuna salad, and chicken lettuce wraps. Notice it's all forms of greenery because we hit the buffet for brunch ... The Asian chicken salad dressing was yummy and not sour\/spicy, had plenty of warm white meat chicken, and the chopsticks were a nice touch. The ahi tuna I snuck from my friends' plate was chilled on the inside and warm\/chewy on the outside. I poured some of my Asian dressing on a chicken lettuce cup and don't regret it one bit. Their lettuce cups are fresh and such a healthy green color; the filling stayed on the inside because of the multiple cup layers holding it in. 

Food is good, l'll try the macaroni and cheese pizza next time.

From its appearance, which reminds me of the color of pink that my friend had vomited after eating a strawberry milkshake, to its confusing counterintuitive layout. I had felt like I entered and exited the wrong door:

I was in Las Vegas this past September for a social outing. Now, behold: I was not the person who wanted to come here. Far from it. So while I am going to use this time on Yelp to kick my feet up in the air in a fit of childish rage, I was also pleasantly surprised.

And for that, I bequeath it an extra star. 

I knew somebody who knew somebody else who liked this place because it offers a $1000-gold-encrusted sundae with a gold spoon. The only people who actually order this sundae are people commissioned by Food Network or campy documentaries on Las Vegas to photograph\/film\/review\/fetishize it. 

But the decadence and silliness of Las Vegas people ordering such desserts happens often enough, according to a server with middle american permed bangs who boasted to our table about it.

The food is typical diner fare and I felt as if I was lucky, incredibly lucky, to choose a delicious boca burger that wasn't as bland and horrible as I was expecting it to be. The sweet potato fries are, in fact, so surprisingly good, it disillusioned me. Everything was more fluffy, than big. But it certainly was filling.

I got their Deep Fried Oreo Sundae. It was ice cream with Deep Fried Oreos breaded in a batter of corn flakes. If you've ever eaten Deep Fried Oreos at the town fair, the corn-flake breading adds a new crunchy dimension to it, which goes nicely in the ice cream.  

As for drinks, make sure to try their Frozen Hot Chocolate Coffee. It's an oxymoron, I know, but it tastes along the lines of a slushy milk chocolate and much richer than the variety you find at Dunkin Donuts. They add shavings of chocolate, and the one I drank had a caffeine kick to it.

Just a few words of caution: If you order from the take-out line, you cannot order anything that involves frying or cooking anything. This meant no Deep Fried Oreo Sundae for me the second time around. 

Also, the treats are made differently. My friend ordered a Strawberry Fields sundae and it was more whipped cream than anything else. And the whipped cream from a can -- not made fresh. The rest of us were happy with our Frozen Hot Chocolates.",2,1,1

However, this time around, my service was terrible! If we wanted to get something like another spoon, extra straw, more napkins, or hot water, it was rarely from our own waiter. We always got it from this kind busboy, which I don't even think it was his job to do that for us to begin with! When the bill came around, I asked if I could use my total rewards card to knock down the prices. The waiter, I believe his name was Jeffrey G, told me that he cannot give me the discounts. That doesn't make sense. Why would they advertise it if we couldn't do it? I then asked him why, and he hesitated for a long time, then said that he has asked us from the beginning if anyone had the total rewards card and that we said no. I CLEARLY do not remember him asking any such thing, nor did we respond ""no"" to totals reward. He proceeded to say that he can no longer change what is in the system, which being a waitress myself, I KNOW that it isn't completely true. Then he left the table, and when we were trying to flag him down, he would clearly look at us and then walk away, ignoring our table. He finally came back to the table when we were already standing up and walking out.

We still tipped him decently, because of the busboy. But now that we think about it, we shouldn't have.

Then the 2nd time we went in a group, all eating and drinking. Well first of all, one in our group tried to order a Cherry Limeade, and the waitress said ""no, we don't have those"". I suggested to her that perhaps her bartender could make one since it's only soda water, lime juice and cherry syrup. She looked at me like I was nuts, and didn't even offer to ask the bartender. We sat there in awkward silence until the person who tried to order it said, that's ok, I'll have a Cherry Pepsi instead.

It's common courtesy to let others walk through a small space before you, and when you're the staff and a customer is waiting to get through, you should let the customer through first. I found many of the staff to be very rude in this way. They would even drop doors on the faces of their customers when going out to the patio. I have really never seen so many rude staff members in one establishment before. We also waited forever for our food which was served one person\/plate at a time, and then waited forever for our waitress to deal with our check.

She had seen it featured on either the Travel channel or Food Network or something.  She mentioned they have a $1000+ sundae with gold flakes and all kinds of ridiculous stuff, but she really wanted to try the frozen hot chocolate.  So after lunch at Enoteca, we headed down the strip and went to give this place a shot.

We grabbed a table outside and went to order our treats from the outside window.  I observed that the prices were pretty high for the various offerings available, so a couple friends and I opted to share the large frozen hot chocolate ($10+).  Another couple of friends got one too, and a giant doughnut.

We got our giant cup of fro-ho-cho and dug in.  Effectively, it's like a milk shake with a slightly grainier texture.  Very sweet and good, but nothing super amazing.  The doughnut looked really good and astonishingly massive, but it was still an average doughnut.

Unfortunately, that's all we really got from Serendipity 3, but here's the limited assessment I can make...

Summary: Lots of treats.  Kind of expensive but large portions\/sizes.  Frozen Hot Chocolate (fro-ho-cho, anyone?) is like a milkshake with a little bit of a grainy texture.

It sounded good, so we decided to return for breakfast the following day.

Little did we know how busy it would be the next morning! This sure is a popular spot! We gave our cell phone number to the hostess who said it'd be a good 15-20 minute wait and she'd text us when our table is ready. We went outside (it was FREEZING out, as it was a cold December morning with a bitter wind). The family ordered some coffees and hot chocolates at their ""To Go"" window on the outside of the place, at the rear of the restaurant (not facing the Strip). The Coffee ""Serendip"" was a hit with my teen kid with its undertones of nutmeg and other wintry spices. 

We got the hostess' text after a 20 minute wait and were seated at a table inside. Our waitress was pleasant and gave us menus soon after, but it took another 10 minutes for her to return to take our orders, and then it took 37 minutes for us to get our orders! That's a long time for a hungry family to wait. 

When the food came, it was good. Hubby and one kid had the hot wings, which they really liked. The plates were quite large; large enough to feed two people per plate, easy. My other kid ordered the ""Bigger than your Head"" pancakes. They were humongous and she could barely eat one (let alone two). She said it was ""okay, but rather doughy"". I just ordered a poached egg, which was fine (hard to mess that up, though, I guess!). All in all, I'd say the food is average to perhaps a bit above average, but the portions are so so big and that can be a bit of a turn-off for some (best to be prepared to share dishes, I think).

The place was busy but we noticed quite a few empty tables, our wait time given by the hostess was 45 minutes, I believe we only had to wait about 30. I like that they can text you that your table is ready, so I really don't have to hang out in front of the restaurant in the heat if I don't want to. We decided to sit inside since it was so hot out.
Our waitress was Tina, she could've been friendlier, but she did an adequate job waiting on us.
I hate the huge menu's, it was difficult to peruse their offerings at our small table of 4. The plates were also too big for our table. The music inside the restaurant was way too loud for the tiny space, people would like to talk...not lose their hearing!
The prices were a bit high but it helps if you have a Total Rewards card, the prices are slightly cheaper if you present this to your waitress upon ordering.
I got the Chicken Strip appetizer so I could save room for dessert. They were good, nice and crispy on the outside, moist warm white meat chicken on the inside. The dipping sauces were good too, I liked the Honey Mustard best, my husband liked the BBQ sauce. My husband got the Cheeseburger with Brie Cheese and Fries, it was an okay burger, not a lot of flavor, but it was cooked correctly. The fries were not fresh or hot, we had to others at our table who got fries and only one of us got fresh fries. We had a view of the kitchen from our table and noticed that they make tons of fry orders and let them sit there til someone orders them.

I obviously thought wrong. Showed up on a Saturday around noon-1pm and had a 40min wait for a party of 6. Opted to go to the take out window which had a REALLY slow line. One thing I did notice about the interior of Serendepity is that it isn't anywhere as close to the interior of the original. SAD!

Can someone please explain why people get in line without knowing what they want to order or at least don't spend the time to figure out what they want while they're in line? GET COMMON COURTESY! read the menu before you stand in line so you don't waste everyone's time behind you while you figure it out!

Anyhow, back to Serendipity. Their takeout menu is a bit boring and from what I remember it's mainly dessert, hot dogs and salads. Their hot dogs are HUGE! (thats what she said) I could've seriously shared it with two other people, or one other depending on how big of an appetite the other person has.. but wow. kudos for the hotdog. My friend got the Frozen Hot chocolate which was just as delicious as NY maybe better because it was a hot vegas day.

And I had fond memories of that delicious dessert that I drank up all by myself that rainy and cold day on the East Coast.

With the recent opening of Serendipity 3 on Las Vegas Boulevard, I had a whole new setting to experience this lovely and decadent drink.  

Heading there for lunch on a weekday, we chose to sit outside despite the breeze.  Our friendly and spirited waiter was patient with us as we took forever to order.

Lorna D. started off her beverage choice with their Mochaccino ""Our Own Brew of Rich Chocolate and Aromatic Espresso with a Topsy Turvey Whipped Cream Peak"" *$5).  It was a yummy drink that tasted more chocolaty than espresso-like.

For lunch, our friend chose the Breakfast Steak Sandwich ""NY Steak, Sunny Side Up Eggs, Smoked Pepper Bacon, Cheddar and Jack Cheeses"" ($20) with Sweet Potato Fries.  Now, it does seem quite pricey, but these orders are really meant to be split.  Three large eggs laid their sunny eyes up as bacon spilled out from the sides.  

Lorna D. was craving more of a breakfast item and had the Central Park ""Casper, with Spinach, Avocado and Swiss Cheese"" ($14) with Coleslaw.  It's a six egg white omelet folded gently with avocado slices on top.  It was definitely more than enough food and she liked the coleslaw too.

I went for the High Heel Pump ""Prosciutto, Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil Pesto and Balsamic Glaze"" ($16) with Sweet Potato Fries.  Looking absolutely gorgeous as an open-faced sandwich, it yearned to be shared.  The flavors of the prosciutto, mozzarella, tomato, pesto, and glaze worked so perfectly together.  I couldn't wait to bring some home for the Husband to taste!  (And it tasted very good later as leftovers, we even toasted it when we got home. Yum!)  The sweet potato fries were really good too, the perfect amount of sweetness and a sprinkling of salt leaves you without the need for a dipping sauce of any kind.  

Of course we couldn't go without having their Frrrozen Hot Chocolate ($9.75)!  Yum! So decadent, so delicious and still as good as I remembered!  Perfect for a party of two or three to share!

Service was still friendly by the end, but business had picked up so it took a bit longer to get to go boxes and things like that.

Overall, Serendipity 3 does things right.  Don't be turned off by the high prices, just plan on sharing everything!  It's the perfect ending to a date!",6,3,6

We made reservations and showed up early but we seated promptly.  If you don't make reservations during the typical lunch and dinner hours, you'll get stuck with a long wait time.  

The place vomits pink.  My husband said ""put one leg on each side of the entrance door and [expletive deleted]"".  You get the picture.  I personally feel that someone took Barbie, let her drink a shroom shake, smoke a joint, drop acid and gave her some XTC and let her loose in this place.  I personally hate frilly and girly decor, so to each his own.

The service is fair, but when busy it seems they forget you exist for a few minutes.  When we finally did get our order in and receive our food (burger and fries), I was disappointed.  I expect more from this place, for some reason, and to have mediocre food that isn't even pleasant to my palette, i get depressed.  The food depressed me.  The only happy ending was having a frozen hot chocolate to share before leaving.

I will never step into this pink nightmare again.  Given that people love this place, I personally cannot bring myself to eat their mediocre food and pay hotel restaurant prices for it.  Although the service deserves a 3, the food, alas, deserves nothing more than 2 stars at best.

Let's hope that Serendipity's improves the quality of their food.  I assume that this is the late night place for people to go where they don't really taste anything but will swear up and down that it's the best thing they've ever tried.  Other than that type of justification, I cannot fathom as to why this place is famous other than their dessert and frozen delights.

Come here for the sweets, perhaps, but avoid the menu.  If you do order their food you will leave slightly hunched over and morose at how blah their food is.

I knew coming in that for me this place was all the about the ice cream - I wanted something huge and ridiculous. But as soon as we sat down, the table next to us ordered the largest, most beautiful plate of nachos. So we ended up ordering one of those as well. One plate of nachos and one Deep Fried Snickers Sundae. 

The nachos had two kinds of meat - chicken on one side and beef on the other. It was like getting two dishes with completely different flavors in one. I kept going back and forth between them because I couldn't possibly decide which one I liked better!

When my sundae arrived in its huge goblet, it was sitting on a plate due to all the over-flowing - they really fill that thing up so you get your money's worth! The waiter warned me that this sundae melts faster than any other due to the hot fried Snickers. But that didn't bother me! I love my ice cream super melty. So I dug in and took my time. I'd swapped out a scoop of vanilla for a scoop of Oreo. And I probably should've done the same with the chocolate, too. There's so much hot fudge on this thing that having chocolate ice cream just doesn't make sense - hot fudge and Oreo would've been perfect! My only minor disappointment with this dish was how surprisingly hard the Snickers were. I was looking forward to them being hot and melty from the fryer. But I guess they might freeze them beforehand to avoid a mess?

I didn't visit this place in NY for years because I thought it was all hype. (Also because all people talk about is the Frozen Hot Chocolate, which just doesn't sound as amazing as these sundaes.)

The waiter was fast, and friendly. He didn't really do a whole lot of chit chat which I am perfectly okay with! 

FOOD: EXCELLENT!! 
I ordered the Ahi Tuna salad. This was so refreshing!! The tuna was superb, and the avocado was just the right texture! I could not finish the salad because the portion was huge which is why I think the 17 dollar price tag was fair and the tuna was so good! 

My husband ordered the ABC burger. It comes with avocado, brie cheese and caramelized onions. I watched him cut it down the middle and the cheese was melted on there just the right way! It looked really delicious and came with sweet potato fries. He really enjoyed his meal.

We also ordered a frozen hot chocolate of course.. peanut butter cup flavor. It was 11 dollars so high, but worth it! We did not order alcohol. In fact, you really should only order alcohol in a Casino because anywhere else in Vegas you go there is a 500 percent mark up!! But we really are not drinkers and it was way too hot that weekend!!

I recently came back to Vegas in February. Now this place is very crowded during breakfast.  I suggest coming after 2:00PM because they have  a larger selection for lunch. They now have a to-go line outside of the restaurant, but the menu is very limited. I suggest you make reservations if you want to eat here now. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar this time.

Look at those custom plates! This place has decor down to a T.  It's clear they cater to us beautiful women out there, with all the pink, the hello kitties at the door, all the way down to the pretty chairs.  BUT, Serendipity 3 does food well.  My boyfriend enjoyed the meaty burger he had and I think the other two guys in our party the first time we were here also enjoyed their meals.  

My friends and I came here for lunch one day and we all tasted the frozen hot chocolate.  We thought it was, okay.  Sweet, but nothing to gush over. On this visit I ordered the ABC burger: $16.50. Avocado, brie, and carmelized onions.  I probably should have shared this with someone.  It's rather large and rich in taste, mental note next time.  My boyfriend also ordered a strawberry milkshake ---- YUMMM!! WAYY better than the frozen hot chocolate.  

The second time I visited here was for a bachelorette breakfast with a bunch of girlies and the lovely bride to be.  We each ordered a plate and all shared, family style.  I ordered the Mochaccino which was AWESOME! It really was =) I loved every sip I took.  So here are our orders.

That last one I'll definitely order again, it was so delicious!! I loved my corn beef hash, but bendicts are my fave, throw in sausage gravy, and you got me in lust!  Eating family style allowed us to taste every dish, and they were all great.  The balsamic & strawberry was different, you wouldn't think that this pairing would work, but it went well together harmoniously.  The hangover omelet was also delicious, fries in anything is GOOD!  Holy Huevos Rancheros was a nice presentation, but I have a thing for eggs in the morning, so I'd probably order that at lunch next time.  

Service both times were great.  The hostess was sweet & professional when I made both reservations and though the waiter took kind of awhile on our second visit both waiters both times were friendly, nice and did their best to get our food out in a timely manner.

Order a sundae if you have more than 2 people, as it is cheaper than the price of 3 cones. It comes in a large plastic cone with petals so that it's easy to share, walk, and eat. They really think of everything in Vegas.

My recommendation is to buy one, sit by the foundations, and see which one of you gets ice cream on themselves first. That person has to buy the next sundae.

My family & I spent Thanksgiving in Vegas, and ever since we've heard about their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate, we've been wanting to try it here, since the only other location is in NYC. 

Since it was thanksgiving, I decided to make a reservation, just in case the place crowded up for lunch. I made our reservation for 2:30, but after shopping at the Forum Shops, we decided to go in at 2. 

When making my reservation, the hostess rude and very uninviting. She seemed to be in a ""whatever"" mood, I'm assuming they were quite busy and she decided to be in somewhat of a bitchy mood. When she asked me whether I wanted indoor or outdoor seats, I said ""whichever is available at the time"" (okay, maybe that was a dumb response) and proceeded to give me a short lecture about how when making reservations you need to give an exact response just like giving an exact time. Okay, I understand I might've sounded dumb, but don't talk to your customers as if they're kids or something. It didn't really seem like she wanted to help me after that. 

When we came back around 2, I was a bit iffy and worried my parents wouldn't enjoy the restaurant since it's very whimsical and young and hip, especially since the hostess gave me sort of a negative vibe.

-Chicken Strips..... forget it! that horrible Tabasco sauce that Hooters use is also used here....go to Buffalo Wild Wings instead or get the Spicy wings at the Albertsons deli...(amazing) 
-Nachos: I didn't know it was possible to ruin Nachos until now, the canned black beans and dehydrated ground beef makes Taco Bell a 5 star restaurant....skip them and go to the Yard House for Nachos...best in Vegas (I'm not kidding) 
-Oreo frozen hot chocolate.....I know my junk food and let me tell you something...those are not oreos, they are some cheap version of oreos because it has that medicine after taste. 
-Carrot cake ice cream...Semi good, You could actually build a better one at home, the cake tasted frozen old and the ice cream was substandard, Cold Stone has better quality than this 14 dlls overpriced thing oh and the nuts on top were also old. 
CLEANLINESS: 
Dirty, there are heavy traffic restaurants in Vegas just like this one and they are clean. 

The run down...If you have time to waste and want to people watch this is ok, It has a great location outdoor and indoor tables but the food is substandard including the service, I believe that the only reason they are still in business its because of the location and they get tourists that eat there once then leave the city just like airport food.

My server wisely advised me to order the marshmello sauce on the side, because it is way to sweet in any sort of normal dose. The deep-friend Oreos were awesome, the seemed to be breaded in corn flakes. Seriously, it put the OC Fair to shame, and that is not easy to do in the deep frying department. 

My girlfriend ordered the ""Can't Say No"" sundae, which included humble pie (peanut butter on a graham cracker crust), peanut butter ice cream, coffee ice cream, and a banana. It was freaking awesome, and that humble pie stuff was great. 

I must say, the decor was a bit weird. It had sort of an Alice In Wonderland thing going on, including a clock painted on the wall the showed three-o-clock at all times. I suppose that is because this is Serendipity ""3,"" but I am such a stickler about time that it annoyed me. They also had like signs on the wall from old gas stations and stuff. It just didn't match, and it didn't work. Maybe there was a point to it all, but if there was I missed it. 

So, this place is close to five stars (for desert anyway, we didn't order any other food) but not quite there. I would go back though.",4,3,4

I've been to the original NYC location several times, and looked forward to seeing how this west coast location compared to the east coast OG one. My partner in crime for the weekend, Li, had never been to either location, so was more than happy to accompany her. 

Slightly hungover, we needed sustenance before diving into the famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. I was shocked to find out that the wait was only 20 minutes. The interior doesn't quite have the charm and coziness of the NYC location, but is open and spacious. There is also outdoor seating available. The music was an eclectic mix of 80s, 90s, and current tunes, which I appreciate, but the volume was a bit loud for my liking. 

So, we ordered: 
- Cup of Tomato Soup: The flavor and texture were perfect, and one of my best I've ever had. I loved how it was accented with goldfish crackers. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=Hni3DAqO9NXPth8mNsK5eA 

- ABC Burger: Avocado, Brie Cheese burger. Li and I were intrigued with this unique combo, and decided to split this and it was wonderful. Juicy burger and toasty buns, and ginormous portions of avo and brie. This was accompanied by crisp, sweet potato fries. 

- Frozen Hot Chocolate: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=85Ev04Z-UaQksArEs2ZVNg The grand finale! It didn't disappoint and was super thick and chocolatey. It's better than a chocolate malt\/milkshake, as the consistency is icy, yet creamy. This was topped with a huge dollop of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Talk about choco heaven! Oh Mylanta! We sipped and slurped as much as our stomachs could handle, but failed to finish it. 

Overall, a decent Serendipity experience. Our server wasn't the friendliest nor super attentive. It took some time for my Diet Coke refills, food, and bill  to arrive at our table. Ambiance isn't as quaint and lovely as the NYC location, but it's still fun place to bring your friends and family. Be warned that the prices are a bit high, food portions are large, music is loud, and service can be spotty. There's a lil' retail area for the t-shirts, frozen hot choco packets, etc., Also, unlike the NYC location, there is a take-out window where you can order from a limited menu (some snacks like pretzels, donuts, etc.,as well as frozen hot chocolate) to enjoy in front of the patio tables in front of Caesar's Hotel or to take along while you walk the strip.",23,20,22

The lively crowd, the colorful decor and Jammin' Music created an Amazing atmosphere that made our experience here Super Duper Fun! We were seated on the patio and it made it just more romantic. We started off with the Kobe Sliders with a side of sweet potatoes fries and to top it off with the Frozen Hot Chocolate. The Sliders were not memorable and just plain average. The sweet potatoes fries was crispy and tasted sweet as potato pie. I would have to say this was the best part of the meal. Now on to the finale, the infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate. It came out melted and it reminded me of frozen chocolate shake. I was not impressed with the price ($14) or the taste! I think McDonald's chocolate shake will give Serendipity a run for their money.

But it's also one of Serendipity's four locations nationwide, so might as well check it out. There's plenty of outdoor seating if you're taking to go, courtesy of Caesar's.

I've dined in probably twice and had some sort of spaghetti, which came in larrrrgeeee serving size, complete with three meatballs. They have a bar inside, also, so complimented it with a drink. Everyone raves about their frozen hot chocolate, which is pretty bomb, and I don't even like chocolate. It gets a little too sweet if you have it around for too long, though. These drinks can be costly, but you're in Vegas to splurge, so might as well!

Now usually I only stop by for the street part of it, so I'm not necessarily dining in, and just get one of their to-go items in the back of the restaurant. I go for the Las Vegas style hot-dog, which is literally the length of my forearm, topped with cheese and jalapenos. HUUUUGE. Trust, it's $9, the same price as the sliders, but the sliders are MINI.

This one...is not quite the same. They have a to-go order place outside which can be pretty useful, and an indoor\/patio seating area. It definitely didn't have the fantasy-landish, childlike daydream, alice-in-wonderland feel of the other one. It felt more like a glorified Mcdonalds. But hey, its' Vegas right, maybe feeling like a lil kid here would be too much. 

We ordered

ABC burger - Avocado, brie, caramalized onions. Sounded delicious but it wasn't. I love burgers too :( I would rather have had In n Out. And for 3 bucks instead of TWELVE. 

Chicken pot pie - NO. nonononono. Two ppl ordered it and neither finished more than a few bites. 

Hangover omelet - this was one of the better dishes, an omelete with bacon and egg and french fries. But even this was only okay, which sucks because bacon and french fries is almost like cheating! Overall it was just really ...eggy. 

Corned Beef Reuben - Pretty damn good. Thick slices of corned beef. But this isn't supposed to be a jewish deli. Still a good sandwich though.

Frozen Hot Chocolate - Just as good as NY. It was amazing.

I've frequented the Serendipity's in New York many times and this location is nowhere near in comparison. To start, we had to wait at least 15 minutes on a weekday at 2pm for two people. There were plenty of empty tables inside and outside. The problem seemed to be that they lacked enough staff to actually clear and clean the tables as soon as patrons left.

While we waited for our table, we stood outside and perished the menu posted on the wall. Was looking forward to trying their sundae with the humble pie. As soon as we sit down inside and look at the menu, we realize the menu isn't the same. I asked the waiter where the sundae was on the menu and he tells me that they don't make humble pie anymore and that the menu outside is old and they haven't bothered to change it.

Disappointed, I order a cookie sundae and my friend orders the frozen hot chocolate - something she had been looking to try the whole trip.

The deserts come quickly. Her dessert is much smaller than the one they have in NYC. My sundae is mediocre. Basically just cookie dough ice cream and a cookie. 5 minutes after serving our desserts, our waiter comes and drops off the bill basically preventing us from ordering anything else.

No one came to greet us or take our orders. We had to fish one menu that was sitting on the counter. There was one guy behind the counter, but he refused to look up or talk to anyone and just cleaned the counter in circles. 

I flagged down three waiters, who said that they can't do anything other than bus tables and get food from the kitchen. One of them said that we need to talk to the bartender, but the bartender was leaving so we need to wait until the next bartender comes. When the guy did come, there was more silent treatment, yay!

The wait was ridiculous for inside seating (2 hours +) so we decided to grab some food inside of the Ceasar's food court then later go back to their outside window to order some frozen hot chocolates. 
The line was pretty long still for the outside and we figured out why when we got up to the window FINALLY.. the guy who was working was all by himself struggling to juggle everything all at once, poor guy.
We had 7 girls so we shared two large frozen hot chocolates which are made for two people but it was just enough, just get extra straws if you're going to do so. It was really good but truthfully tasted like a typical chocolate milkshake but more chocolate flavorings which was good, I also actually liked the grittiness from the mixture.
It was good to try but not worth the $8.00",2,3,2

We saw enormous pieces of ice cream cake and onion rings (not together). They delivered our frozen hot chocolate first. It had lots of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Wow.

I ordered to go because eating inside the restaurant would take too long and my group only came for dessert. I ordered the infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate for $11 and I didnt even know this kind of dessert existed. Haha I thought how can hot chocolate...be frozen? It is a chocolate flavored smoothie and it so sooo goood. I was a fool and split with my friend but I could have easily had it all by myself. It is so sweet, chocolatey, and absolutely heavenly :) You HAVE to get it!!

**TIPS**
1) Avoid the wait and just get the frozen hot chocolate to go. You order on the side and you can sit outside. It is a beautiful view of the strip.

His food suggestions were spot on and delicious. He suggested the steak and egg sandwich on garlic bread, we all split.

He warned me it was a foot long which made laugh because of the suggestive nature of a foot long weiner. So I changed my order to the chili dog, realizing, laughing at myself, as it came out that it too  was a foot long! The French fries were great, the kind that stay crispy forever.

Not that the experience was horrible. We did have to wait like 45 minutes for a table and about 20 minutes for an order of onion rings but considering this everything was just perfectly sub par.

With all of the hype surrounding this popular NY\/LV eatery my friends and I just haddd to go there. After the 45 minute wait we finally were sat down and the one person who had been there and was dying for their waffle fries asked where it went on the menu. He LAUGHED and said they don't serve them anymore. (liiil rude esp since he just had gotten started as our server).

Anyhoo we ordered the onion rings. They took a good 20 minutes to come out and uhhh they tasted like onion rings. It's cute how everybody thinks something is so amazing off of a gimmick such as making it into a tower, but try putting them on a plate y'all. They're plain cheese dusted onion rings.

Entrees: no one was particularly blown away by anything in particular. I did like my chicken pot pie but the flavor was nothing different than one I could have gotten out of the frozen food section. (maybe hit it up with some herbs?) my friend did like and actually finish her summer bries sandwich and the other 2 girls liked their burgers but our last friends veggie burger got a great big ol YUCKO all around. It was house made\/some non boca burger version which we appreciated but the gratitude ends there. It tasted like it was made from chopped up al dente garbanzo beans (al dente garbanzos are not looked upon highly in the bean world) and just flat out had no flavor. Even the massive chunk of avocado couldn't save it. She wept.

After the tears were gone we tried to alleviate her pain with their faaaamous frozen hot chocolate. To our servers dismay we split the single serving between 5 girls. We received the whip cream tower that was the frozen hot chocolate and dug in. It was perfectly boring. Every single person that raved about this dessert needs to go out and have an actual decadent chocolate dessert experience. Only then will you understand how terribly non chocolatey and boring this rip off of a dessert was. It made us reminisce to the rich thick mousse like creaminess that was cravings @ mirage's chocolate pudding. We all wept.

The issue that I have with this place are their prices. It is crazy that they charge $20 for a basic cheese burger with a side of fries. I get that this place is on the strip in front of Caesars, but to charge these prices is absolutely crazy. For 5 of us to eat there the bill was $205 with the tip. I can get the same food at a red robin or similar place. No one had anything fancy 2 cheese burgers, grilled cheese with tomato soup, chicken sandwich, 2 beers, 1 frozen hot chocolate and deep fried Oreos with some ice cream. Again the staff was great we had a really cool waiter that had a great personality. The issue is with their prices for some average bar food that you can get anywhere around town for much less.

My suggestions:
- off the back order a Frrrrozen Hot Chocolate.... first (Liezl E. Put it best)
- The Crab Cake Salad with the Vinaigrette is fantastic
- The chicken strips are the best I have ever had (not dry or over fried)
- The Pizza's are flavorful, try the pesto!
- The Chicken Pot pie is also as good as it sounded, with a flakey crust and tender meat and fresh veggies.
- Cheeeeeese cake..... get it, you'll love it, then want to take it to the little white chapel in Vegas to marry it.

The other breakfast food items looked good but massive as the servers brought them out to adjacent tables. 

My friend and I both independently decided on the Mint Frrrozen Hot Chocolate and reasoned that it was cheaper to order the ""For Two"" sized portion of the same flavor. It was a huge glass\/bowl, and about 1\/3 was just whipped cream. The frozen hot chocolate itself was very minty, and I did like the touch of Andes mints on top. It was refreshing, cool especially after walking around the Strip in 80 degree weather, and not too frozen that it was hard to drink through the straw. The spoons provided we mostly used to tackle the whipped cream, haha. 

That was the only item we got off the menu since I had to get to the airport soon after, and all I can say is wowzers...calorie-wise that was pretty much my breakfast and lunch allocation in one sitting.

I'm not quite sure why everyone is raving about the frozen hot chocolate, it literally taste like a chocolate shake. We only came here for desserts, and to be honest, a dessert order can probably serve 3 persons. We all ordered a dessert of our own and shared. 

This is what we ordered:
(1) 1 frozen hot chocolate
(1) Humble Pie
(1) Ice cream with deep fried oreos

I've already commented on the hot chocolate, now to the Humble pie.
The humble pie is a gianormous piece of peanut butter and graham cracker pie. This literally taste like eating peanut butter out of the jar and butter. Very Rich. 

The ice cream with the deep fried oreos, is probably what I would order again if i wanted a sugar rush. C'mon anything deep fried more or less is devilishly good and dipping the deep fried oreo with the ice cream and whipped cream was chocolately goodness.

The burger appeared to be on a pretzel like bun so i was disappointed to find sesame seeds and not salt on top (I'm a salt whore!). The burger was very tasty, but I wouldn't get it again. Next time I want a burger I'll stick to the burger specialty places on the strip (BLT, Strip Burger, Burger Bar) instead. Waffle fries were yummy. I'm rounding this up to 4 stars because my fiance adored his pot pie. Shortrib was awesome and the crust was flaky buttery goodness.

The food is still very good though, and the frozen hot chocolate is always a winner. For those that say you can get a better blended from Starbucks or Coffee Bean, you may be right, you may be wrong...but if you want something unique to Serendipity 3, I would get the peanut butter frozen hot chocolate next time.

Although I read the reviews, I wanted to try it simply because of the desserts, and I now wish I would have just picked them up at the outside service after a meal elsewhere. Aside from the desserts that you can get to-go, the only saving grace of Serendipity is their location since it is literally on LVBD. 

With this being my first review, I would have given Serendipity a 2 star rating in my own head until I saw that to YELP, 2 stars means that I have just ""experienced better."" The fact of the matter is, I HAVE YET TO EXPERIENCE WORSE. 

To start the night, my date and I walked to the front to check in for our reservation. The girls did not seem to understand what a reservation was, and it took me a minute to explain to them that I actually called ahead. They then proceeded to tell me that I was better waiting for my reservation than an actual table because it would be sooner. This really showed that they didn't understand I was just letting them know I was there.

Once seated, our waitress came promptly and asked what we would like to drink. She brought our drinks back right away, so I thought the night would turn out quite well. This prompt service set my expectations too high.

For the next ten minutes, she would come by every two minutes or so, interrupt our conversation, and say ""are you ready yet?"" and ""how about now?"" PEOPLE DO LIKE TO TALK WHILE AT DINNER AND SHOULD NOT BE RUSHED.

Even if we sat right down and looked right at the menu, it would take at least twenty minutes to fully look over the menu because it is so chaotic. Before heading to the restaurant, please take a glance at the menu on their website before going. 

The food that came out was very bland and mine was overcooked (burnt, rather). My date didn't seem to like her meal much either, but then again, most people don't openly complain on first dates. 

Since the food made us both ""full"" rather quickly, and we heard that we needed to try the desserts for sure, we looked for our waitress so we could order and she was nowhere to be found. So basically, she couldn't wait to take the initial order, and then didn't want to help at all. 

Finally after asking another waitress for an order of dessert, we were given the first good piece of the meal all night. Their dessert selection is rather large and quite nice, which is why I initially recommended take it out from the side store that they have. 

On Scale of 1-5...
Service: 2 (only because we received our drinks quickly)
Appetizers\/Entrees: 1
Location: 4
Organization\/Decor: 1
Price: 2 - I have no problem paying for a good meal and spending a lot, but this was not even close to good. 
Friendliness: 1

Overall, the most important categories to me got a 1, so it is just a 1 in my book.

It's a fun, casual place and great for large groups.  Parking is a pain, though, since you have to park at Caesar's and the walk is pretty far.  The best thing is to valet if you can because the walk from the valet is short.

However, the food is hit or miss.  The first time I went I had the veggie burger.  It was okay, but not the tastiest.  The next time I had the chicken caesar salad, which I would not order again.  I love croutons and think they're one of the best things about caesar salad, but the ones they serve are huge (like a Rubik's cube almost!) and not crunchy.  This last time, I had a pizza and it was delicious.  So from now on, I'm pretty sure I'll stick to the pizza.  The sweet potato fries and the spinach artichoke dip are also really good.

And then of course, there's the famous frozen hot chocolate.  Serendipity is one of my favorite movies so I really wanted to love the frozen hot chocolate.

It's been hyped in the movies, hyped on Food Network, hyped by word of mouth.  I had to go, and when I found out they opened one in Vegas, it was perfect!  I stared at the place as we walked up and down the strip and I decided that we should go there on our last day in Vegas.  

I was super excited watching people taking their Frozen Hot Chocolate on-the-go.  People just seemed to enjoy it so much!  I didn't expect the place to look so....pink.  We went  inside and asked for a table for 4.  The girl looked at us, and said it would take about 25 minutes.  I looked around and saw that it was about 60%, it was only 2pm.  The tables that were empty just needed to be bused and we would've gotten seated right away.  Anyway, we agreed and she said, ""Okay table for 2, your name?""  We looked at her confused, and I said no, for 4.  Maybe an Asian, Middle Easterner, and two Mexicans weren't the ""ideal"" group, but c'mon!!!  Don't look at us all confused when clearly we said for 4 less than 30 seconds ago!  After about 20 minutes, we got seated and we looked at the crazy, fun menu and tried to decide what we wanted to grub on.  I looked around the restaurant to see what others have ordered, and everyone either just finished or they didn't have anything at the table.  So it was up to us to just pick something and hope that it was a decent size and delicious!  

We decided for 2 regular Frozen Hot Chocolates, Chocolate Cake, and Carrot Cake.  Our food came out in no time and the cakes were huge!  I was so excited to take the 1st sip!  Okay, I give you this....I'm not a big fan of chocolate, and I hate anything that comes from a powder mix.  Yes, why did I want to try the Frozen Hot Chocolate??  Just because, it's one of those things you just HAVE to try.  Anyway, it wasn't the greatest thing I've ever drank.  It was good, but because I can taste the powder mix of the drink, I wasn't a fan.  Everyone else liked it though!  Chocolate Cake and Carrot Cake, delicious!  It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, and it was moist and smooth.

After reading other reviews and said that the original in New York is way better, I still have to try it.  I can't say I'm disappointed.  It was good, but I still want to go where the original is.  Maybe when it's not 100 degrees outside, and more like 30 degrees in the snow would make this place a wonderful experience.

Some friends of our order the appetizer nachos with chicken and beef it was a huge order enough to feed a football team! OK I'm over exaggerating but the portion size was huge. My husband and I had a Oreo sundae that was deep-fried yes I said deep-fried Oreos! And I had the sin city hot chocolate topped with whipped cream and chocolate morsels!  You get to choose your liquor from about 7 different options. It was the loaded with alcohol but I feel like all the chocolate morsels on top took away from the hot chocolate!

Even though the wait was excruciatingly long, the NYC frozen hot chocolate more than made up for it.

Fast forward a week later and here I was in Vegas for my sister's 21st birthday. I was excited to learn that Serendipity's had a location out here especially since it's much closer to me than New York.  Located along the strip, in a stand alone building, right outside of Cesars, our wait was only 20 minutes.  We were seated in the outside patio area which would've been nicer if the tall shrubs didn't block our view of the strip.  I suppose the 'barrier of shrubs' were put in place because of the loud noise along the strip and the very close proximity of people walking up and down the strip. The menu is a bit expensive for regular fare food: $10 appetizers, $15 hot dogs\/burgers, etc. However,  the size of their food items are pretty gigantic so my sister and I split a burger with waffle fries which ended up being fine....except of course for their sharing charge! We had the ABC burger which included Avocado, Brie, & Caramalized onions. It was pretty good and pretty filling.  The waffle fries were well cooked, although they went a little overboard with the seasoning.

Onto the frozen hot chocolate: UGH. After taking my first sip, I replayed a possible scene in my head: throwing a tantrum like a 2 year old in front of everyone present and whining, ""This is NOT the same as the one I had in NYC!  This is blended beyond belief into a liquid mess without the frothy icy texture! It's also waaaaaaay too sweet.  I want another one (arms folded, sour face with a big pout)!""  But of course, one can only dream.

I'd actually come back to try some of their other foods (salads, sandwiches, and pizzas), but I'd pass on the frozen hot chocolate. They also have a sundae called the ""Golden Opulence."" No other description except for its price: $1,000. Out of sheer curiosity,  if I had the cash, I'd actually spend it just to see what this sundae has to cost so much. Anyway,  I suppose going to the original Serendipity's in NYC just gave me too much of an expectation for Sin City's Serendipity's.",0,2,0

The potatoes were really yummy and had a lot of toppings. They weren't greasy at all which is always a great thing. The frozen hot chocolate hit the spot but of course, even sharing it, it didn't get finished.

Gotta add that the service was great! Our waitress was extremely funny, polite and always made sure that we were doing well.

A word of warning, if you do decide to try this restaurant out please remember that it isn't cheap. You're going to pay a lot of money for a lot places on the Vegas strip.

One of our orders was wrong, and we didn't get the fixed meal until essentially the very end after everyone was done with their meals.

Props to you, Serendipity 3.

We decided on the dish after shamlessly gawking at the food on the table next to us. Portions are HUGE so share if you can (it'll cut down on the bill too).

We washed down our indulgent meal with large cups of hot chocolate and coffee, both on point in taste. 

Decor was on the whimsy side with hints of a late-1800s ice cream parlor. 
Cool.
Next time I'd prefer to eat outside (the air-conditioning was a bit much). 

Side note: parking was a bitch. Make sure you have enough time to wander through Caesar's before getting to the restaurant.


Service in Vegas is always a toss up for me. We lucked out with our server today. Good job blondie.

Had reservations for an outside table at 8pm on a Wednesday.  We arrived around 7:30 and told the hostess we were early and would take a table ahead of time if one opened up.  She told us that wouldnt happen and to check back in at 8pm for our table.  The inside portion was filled but definitely not swamped, we could not see what the outside seating area looked like.

We went to the bar which was able to seat 10-15 people, and had about 6 of us sitting there.  The girlfriend and I ordered a fish bowl to pass the time.  10 mins later no fishbowl.  15 mins later bartender tells us hes going to get 'The master bartender' to make our drinks.  Not sure if it was a joke or he meant the female bartender working with him who's shift must have ended the same time as he said that as she grabbed her backpack and left.  30 mins lapsed aand it was time for our table, no fishbowl, countless others had mixers served to them in the meantime.

It was now 8pm aand our table should be ready.  Checked w the hostess who told us that we needed to wait to see if any tables were open.  10 mins later they brought us to our table.

The outside seating area had 3 other tables with people and the other 7 or so were empty.  What?  No one walked out before us and the tables werent dirty?  Why the wait?  Waiter came over and asked how we were doing.  We told him we had waited for our fishbowls and they never came.  More or less deadpan expression and said 'Well do you still want it?'  No good sir, we want the delicious food we heard about.  Waiter took our drink orders, 2 sodas.

........10 mins later no sodas.  20 minutes later no sodas.  No one else was seated around us minus a table directly behind which had a family of 3 apparently in the same position as us because the one younger guy was sleeping on the table.

We left after the 20 minute mark without being served our drinks.  We had some lacking service in Vegas but this place takes the cake.  Overpriced menu which would have been forgotten, but lack of service on top of an overpriced menu is just a thumb in the eye with a squirt of lemon juice.",1,1,1

I felt like I was in a kid's bedroom or in la la land when I was dining here. I've been wanting to come here for quite some time now after seeing Serendipity the movie, and missing the opportunity to go to the NYC location. The wait wasn't too bad. The restaurant is spacious with indoor and outdoor seating on the balcony. Since it was extremely hot outside, we wanted to sit indoor, but ended up outdoors anyway! 

The outdoor part of the restaurant is so fluorescent! It was like I was wearing sunglasses with pink lens in them the whole time. There was such a pink glow to everything! My gfs and I shared the Macaroni and Cheese, the Hangover Omelette and their signature Frozen Hot Chocolate. 

Did not like the Mac & Cheese. I think it was because it was WAYYY to cheesy to the point where I can smell the warm cheese which sorta grossed me out. I did like the top of Mac & Cheese though when it first came out! It didn't taste as good as I thought it would be either. The Omelette was whatever. It was a veggie omelette. The egg was nice and fluffy. Loved the fries that came with it! 

My friend got the chicken strips which was a PLUS! I really really liked how it was fried. The breading was so crumbly and flakey! 

The Frozen Hot Chocolate was the BEST.  An Icy cold, slushy, thick chocolate drink?! Heaven in my mouth! The chocolate shavings were so good with it too! It wasn't too chocolate-y either. It was the perfect amount and I absolutely love chocolate so this drink was a MUST!

I have dined at the Serendipity twice in NYC and I fell in love with the shake batter and bowl AND their chicken pot pie. When they opened one here, I was chomping at the bit to relive my love affair. It's not on the menu. I asked and they said it was a different menu because its regional. I understood because not everyone in Vegas wants pot pie in the summer. Still sad.

I do have to say the Mac n cheese and spaghetti are good. I've tried other dishes here and those were the better ones. 

Now a days, I skip the meals and dig right into dessert. I really don't know which are my favorites now because my favorite sundaes are now gone. I loved the Strawberry Fields or the Humble Pie sundae. Again, I asked why and they mentioned that they weren't really selling and they like to try new things. I'm really afraid of loving another sundae here because it may disappear. It's like dating men over and over who have intimacy issues.

Never particularly interested in spending a New York meal on Serendipity 3 and always assuming the restaurant would function better with a group given the size of the portions I found myself awaiting a friend from Columbus at the Caesar's Palace hot spot during my favorite Vegas time - early Sunday morning when the only people on the strip are those just wandering home from Saturday night or those cleaning up after them.  Quiet in a good way with cheesy 80's music playing overhead and as much kitsch and scripted-happy service as I'd expected it would be mere seconds after I was seated that coffee was filled and with both my friend and I favorite sweets to savories our decision was simple - both items arriving after numerous coffee refills in all their gluttonous glory.  Understanding that Serendipity is more about fun than fine dining it was really no surprise that the bottom slice of French Toast was somewhat dry due to a lack of whipped cream saturation and although decent certainly nothing I'd order again and yet what was surprising was the high quality of the Waffles - both golden and crunchy on the exterior with a soft, pliable inside and nicely balanced between sweet and savory by the balsamic strawberries and chocolate.  Satisfied but unwilling to leave Serendipity without sampling one of their signature sundaes the meal was capped with the carrot cake version, a substantial chunk of dense cake complete with cream cheese icing buried in ice cream, walnuts, fudge, and whipped cream that really had no chance of failing in the flavor department if you enjoy sweets, though perhaps a touch less 'subtle' than some like their breakfasts...or lunches...or dinners.",4,1,2

When we finally got our burgers, after being brought a water and not asked it we'd like something to drink, we were asked if we wanted our frozen hot chocolate then. Since we waited over 20 minutes for burgers I thought I better answer yes. It was brought in about two minutes. Great. Now I have a melting frozen dessert while trying to inhale a burger. 

This place desperately needs to revamp its check in process and how their employees treat diners with a coupon! Will never eat there again!",0,0,0

I had been to this location once before about 3 months ago and it was a decent experience: nothing outstanding or overwhelming. The frozen hot chocolates are a great novelty to try, but it's heavy even for someone with a sweet tooth like me. 

Fast forward to Labor Day Monday, 9\/1\/2014. My boyfriend and I checked in at the hostess stand and then waited 15 minutes for our table. It all went downhill after we were seated. After being seated for about 5-7 minutes, we looked around to see if there was a server around our area - our table and the table next to us seemed to be the only ones without a server coming around. After we'd hit that 10 minute mark, I managed to flag down a server walking by and asked her if she was the server for our table. She said no and pointed at another woman who she thought was serving our section, and she proceeded to go over and ask her to come over. I saw the other woman shake her head and continue with her business. 

The server I talked to then came over and reluctantly said she'll be taking our orders now if we're ready. (No apology for the wait - it may not have been her fault, but the gesture would have been nice.) I appreciate that she was going to be serving us, but she seemed like we had totally ruined her afternoon and it just became more of an unpleasant experience. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and she had her own assigned tables to take care of - but if she didn't want to help us, she could have found a manager or talked to the hostess about who the proper server should have been.

The waters and food came out at appropriate wait times. The Meat Madness Pizza was extremely salty and my boyfriend found it inedible after eating 1\/3 of it. I got the alfredo with chicken, it was edible but for the price I had expected better flavor. Portion was large and I didn't finish more than half. The garlic bread that came with the dish was hard and the spread was rubbery. 

By the time we stopped eating our food, we were no longer in the mood to order a frozen hot chocolate. We got our check, mentioned to our server that the food wasn't great and she sorta gave us a nervous smile and walked away. 

I'm not sure where the mis-communication happened with our table and the server assignment, but I kind of wish I had gotten up and left when the idea was on the table. The frozen hot chocolate was good when I had it, but I won't be returning to this establishment again unless someone dragged me here.",1,0,0

The service was surprisingly slow given we only ordered one thing - a one-person portion of the frozen hot chocolate. But anyhow, the frozen hot chocolate was a good way to clench our sweet thirst after walking up and down The Strip.

After a weekend of endless walking, buffets, and sight-seeing, I was ready to end my Vegas trip with a simple, light lunch. Even though this place was probably one of the cheapest places that I ate at in Vegas, the experience wasn't worth this price.

We arrived at Serendipity 3 around noon and it was packed outside and inside. Choosing to sit inside, we got immediate seating. However, no server came to us at all for the first 15 minutes. Needing to catch a flight within 2 hours, I flagged down any random waitress nearby to take down our orders. She was incredibly polite and apologetic for our long wait (it took 30 minutes for our food to come out). I appreciated that she made a great effort to make sure we were satisfied with our experience. My boyfriend and I had a coupon that allowed us to get a free frozen hot chocolate as long as we ordered an entree. He ordered an ""A.B.C."" burger (avocado, brie, and caramelized onions) with steak as the meat (the other option is chicken) and his choice of steak fries for the side; I ordered a mac and cheese. Our total came out to be roughly $33 (without tip), which is unfortunately as cheap as it's going to get for a simple meal in Vegas (unless you choose something from Chinatown or McDonalds).

A.B.C. Burger + Steak Fries
I normally would never touch steak or any other beef item, but wow this burger was delicious. I had a nibble of my boyfriend's medium rare steak topped with melted brie and fresh avocado and loved the combination of A, B, & C in this burger. However, I'd say the BEST thing I ate for this lunch was the steak fries. They were meaty yet crunchy and salty but not thirst-inducing. I don't even know how to describe how wonderful the steak fries were. My boyfriend describes these fries as the best he ever had (next to the fries that he ate on one of his Celebrity cruise line cruises, which tasted incredibly similar). 

Mac & Cheese
I don't know how or why Las Vegas activated my cheese addiction, but I couldn't resist ordering this simple comfort-food staple. The macaroni used for this dish was perfect: large tender shells that held the fluid, creamy cheese and slightly crusted on top. The metal pot that the mac and cheese was served in looked small, but, to my own surprise, this was the first time I didn't finish a cheese dish! I wish i had though (just writing about it right now is making my mouth water)! 

Frozen Hot Chocolate
I was somewhat amused by the oxymoron in the name when I first heard about Serendipity's famous trademarked dessert. Contrary to its name, this dessert isn't actually frozen. But it truly is somewhat of a contradiction. It's frozen enough to be eaten with a spoon but melted enough to be drunk with a straw; it's cold enough to enjoy as a dessert but warm enough to enjoy as a sweet, creamy smoothie. My boyfriend claimed this dessert for himself, and even though it couldn't beat out the steak fries for best part of our meal, it came incredibly close. It's definitely a must-try if you're anywhere near Caesar's Palace and crave a unique dessert!",2,1,2

Here is a hint though... the take-out window on the side of the restaurant is like taking a 50% discount! God only knows why they charge for the food. It's not bad, but it is damn overpriced.

But did you know they have multiple frozen hot chocolate flavors now?  When I went to the flagship Serendipity in NYC, they just had THE frozen hot chocolate. Now there is double chocolate, amaretto almond frozen hot chocolate, white frozen hot chocolate, oreo frozen hot chocoloate, mint chocolate frozen hot chocolate!  I just have to try them all!

I went with a group and we ordered the cheeseburger, nachos, crab cakes, and mashed potatoes. Nothing was that great, just mediocre. The bun of the burger was burnt as well, which was upsetting because apparently the bread popular. Even if it wasn't burnt it still wouldn't have been that great. The cheeseburger cost 17 dollars, in my opinion it was worth 6. The restaurant went cheap on the fries and did not give me very much, which upset me. 

    The service was ok, definitely mediocre again but not awful. 

   To be fair this place is known for their desserts, I think. So I ordered an Oreo milkshake. The milkshake was fantastic.

For being on the Strip and with its name, me and my family expected more. The service was okay for it being busy. 

We ordered the regular sized frozen hot chocolate for $11 (Sharing for-two size it's $14) in original and oreo flavored.

It makes things easier for me to simply admit the fact that sweets are among my weaknesses so I can stop the harebrained idea, which I get here and there, to give up sweets.  I have known for the longest time that trying to tame my affinity for sweets is tantamount to me setting myself up for failure. So yes, I have a sweet tooth.

Anytime I am travelling, I make it a point to try to find the most decadent dessert - ice cream, cupcakes, donuts, pastries... (Really, I can go on and on, but I am sure you get the gist . ""Boring my Yelp review reader"" is not part of my afternoon agenda today.) For my most recent visit to Vegas, Serendipity was most definitely in my radar.

We landed at 9:15 PM and we rushed to Caesar's Palace with one mission in mind: Frrrozen Hot Chocolate should be the first thing to touch our lips in Las Vegas. 9:50 PM and we were there, the restaurant was already closing down so we ran to their takeout window. Perhaps sensing my desperation, the manager was kind enough to give our party The Paddle. He who holds the paddle is the last customer of the day and gets a free Frrrozen Hot Chocolate! Our responsibility was to tell people who would come after us that they should not bother and we get a free drink. Free dessert with a side of bossing strangers around with a license? Sounds like a great deal to me!

We got the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, Oreo Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, and the White Chocolate Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. While all are delicious, the original one was the best. We also got a giant doughnut that is as big as my head for $5. It was a very good doughnut, not too sweet that it gets too tiresome to one's taste buds but still on the side of decadent. It was very soft and almost cake-like.

Hubs and I have been coming here for years, when we visit Vegas. Don't know why, just has become tradition. I say this because every single time (and we've eaten sundaes here at least 10-15 times) their sundaes always arrive melted, looking tired, gloopy and gloppy. And I don't understand why. See the pics? I took them right as it placed in front of us. Gloppy whipped cream, a part of it already landslid, ice cream never has those freshly scooped nooks and crannies. NEVER. Sundaes here never come to you looking like it was just scooped. It looks like it was made 20 minutes ago, but the mystery is, it's not like we waited that long for it. So I don't know what it is with this place, but it's one of the only options on the strip that is an ice cream parlor. And honestly, once you get past the hot (or I guess in this case, cold) mess, it still tastes good. Just not pretty. Guess this is their MO.

I can't wait until I go to NY and try the food at their original location so I can compare. You can either order it to go outside at their window or dine inside. The wait wasn't as bad as expected, only about 10 minutes.

The interior decor was very interesting. Mostly pink and white. They had painted clocks that were all showing as 3:00. At first I started to flip out because I thought they were real. I coulda sworn we got there around 12! Anyway, their menus are freaking huge. You'd have to be as blind as a bat to not be able to read it.

Between me and my friend, we ordered the frozen hot chocolate and the pizza with spinach and mushroom toppings. They have special pizzas like the mac and cheese, but if you're not into that stuff, you can make your own at an additional $1 for each topping. After waiting for what felt like an eternity, our food came out. My friends were getting annoyed because the food took ages to come out and when you have 6 hungover and starving ladies, time is money!

I couldn't even begin to describe how excited I was to try their infamous frozen hot chocolate. It was the first thing that came out, and I immediately latched my mouth onto my straw. Utter disappointment! It reminded me of a frappuccino from Starbucks! It wasn't bad or nasty, but it definitely wasn't living up to it's hype. It was topped with whipped cream and sprinkled with milk and white chocolate shavings. I'm not sure what the big deal is. It was literally like a blended chocolate milk!

Their pizza, however, was a lot better. The crust was light, thin, and soft. I easily folded it so that I could stuff as much as I could in my mouth. It was served on a wooden platter which was probably what it was baked on. The pizza was light but filling. I walked out completely satisfied. 

I'm not sure what the hype is all about, but I'm curious to see how the NY location will turn out. The prices are fair considering how massive the portions are. If you're hungry, try their foot long hot dog. Freaking massive!!",3,2,1

One of the places she suggested was Serendipity 3, which is located at Caesars Palace. The New York restaurant is one of my personal bookmarked businesses. Until she mentioned it, I didn't know there was also one in Las Vegas. 

So after I dropped off my luggage at my stay at the Platinum Hotel, which is only a ""long"" block away from Caesars Palace and the lively Las Vegas strip, I was excited and hurried my ass to Serendipity at Caesars Palace. 

The restaurant is cute and crowded, but the bar was empty and had the crazy football game between the Green Bay Packers and Arizona Cardinals showing on their huge television. Looking at the huge menu, the restaurant serves your typical American food. But my main target was definitely-the Frozen Hot Chocolate with chopped peanut butter cups and clouds of whipped cream for $10.00. Since I was at the bar, the popular frozen treat was prepared at the bar and came really fast and presented in front of my face. I was shocked on how my treat was made with the pretty design and the liquid flooded all over my dish. One sip of my first Frozen Hot Chocolate, I was blown-away on how sinful this treat was. I was enjoying my frosty treat while watching the football game and watching the agile waitresses and gifted chefs working hard in the kitchen.

We told her it was our son's birthday when we ordered the frozen hot chocolate just expecting a candle in it ( which would have been great).

The link is to be determined as my other party members were ok.

The wait for non-reservations was an hour to an hour and a half, steady, and that was at 9 PM. We made a reservation in advance, but they jotted us down for two instead of four. They corrected it quickly and sat our party efficiently. 

Our waiter started off as nice. He brought waters without our asking and came by timely the get our order. Then when we weren't ready and told him, a few more minutes, he multiplied that by a factor of three.

My boyfriend and I had the chicken pot pie and sweet potato fries. My friend had pasta and a frozen hot white chocolate milk. His girlfriend got a chicken salad. Instead they brought her a crab cake salad. She had to go through the hostess to get the waiter as he essentially disappeared. He argued with her about what she ordered then took it back and brought the correct dish about five plus minutes later. They never brought her a new fork and since service was so evasive, it was hard to flag anybody. I gave her mine.

The food was mixed. The frozen hot chocolate tasted good, but boy are those expensive. My friends girlfriend said the chicken didn't taste right. The pot pie was good. The fries were sweet but got cold very quickly.  I don't know if the pot pie made me ill or not. 

The waiter came by and asked if we wanted dessert menus. We said sure and I told him I didn't like the fries. He asked if I wanted something different. I said no and he said he'd remove them from the bill.

About ten minutes plus goes by. He comes back to our table and asks us if we want to see the dessert menus. My friends girlfriend says he asked that fifteen minutes ago but never brought them. He rolled his eyes and gave us our check.  He rung up our cards quickly and we got out of there.

Food: 2.5 stars
Service: 2.5 stars

I told her that I had been waiting and she didn't care! Seriously, your servers are awesome, your food is good but your host stand people need some help on customer service. 

The food took a long time for it to come out and it wasn't that hot (but I was sitting outside so it might have just gotten cold from the outside temp) but like I said the server was awesome and made up for it. Plus, I wasn't in a hurry so it didn't really bother me.  So, I'm not complaining about the food wait time but just thought I would mention it in case you have plans after dining.  

The GOOD: I had an awesome server and the food was good. 

I will be back and this time I will call ahead and a make reservation so I can avoid issues with the host stand.

I would love to try something different like maybe the grilled cheese and tomato soup and the Oreo frozen hot chocolate.

Came here after walking by it the day before, but saw a delicious add in one of the local magazines.  We were drawn to the strange thing called Frozen Hot Chocolate, the hot dog, and pretzel bun for their hamburgers!

It was hot in Vegas the week for us (high 90's) and waited 5 minutes for a table inside for some a\/c, which helped a little, only a little, because all the doors are open.  We met our waiter quickly and put soon put in our orders for a hot dog ($11.50 !!!) and cheeseburger (I think it was around $14).  I opted for the criss-cut fries while my husband opted for the sweet potato (I'm pretty sure that's what they said) fries - it was really yummy.  We also ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate ($5 - not bad considering it really does need to be shared by at least one other person), which was a yummy treat for such a hot day.  We had it before our meal though, otherwise, I'm not sure that we would've been able to finish it.  

After we had our frozen hot chocolate and finished it, the waiting game began. It was at least 40 minutes before we even saw our waiter again. He was super nice, but we never saw him out and about checking on his table.  Same goes for a table next to us.  They had the look of ultimate boredom just waiting for the check!  It got to the point that we were ready to leave before even getting the food. But of course, the food came out just as we were talking to the waiter.  So-we stayed and my hot dog was SOOO long...I swear, they say foot long but I'm positive it's longer.  It's on a toasted roll cut in half (think baguette like) so it's kinda like a sandwich with a hog dog inside.  It came with it's own dish, just as long full of all the dressing you could want on the hot dog, though I only optioned to put cheese on it.  My husband's burger was delicious.  We're happy at this point, but after waiting a little while longer for the check, we ended up just asking someone else to get the check for us and took off.

I agreed and we ended up at Serendipity.  I am always willing to try a new restaurant, especially when they have frozen hot chocolates.  

When we arrived, we fought the line to get our name on the waiting list for a late lunch.  We only had to wait about 15 minutes before being seated.  There were large groups all around us and I was actually surprised at how small this location is.  We were greeted pretty quickly and our server returned with our drinks.  She took the time to go over a few popular menu items but had to excuse herself to larger tables that were calling her.  We decided what we wanted to eat and had to wait a few minutes before our server returned to get our order.  But because we were sitting at a table beside the window\/door we were able to people watch.  

Considering the amount of people in the restaurant, we didn't have to wait very long for our food to arrive.  Of course, I ordered the Ultimate BLT which looked mouth watering!!  My sister had some type of chicken ciabatta sandwich.  We split the sandwiches so we could try a little of both.  I have to admit that thought the BLT was tasty, it was a little dry.  I'm not sure if it is supposed to come with sauce, but mine did not.  I was still overall pleased with the size and taste of my BLT.  The chicken sandwich did NOT disappoint.  Probably one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while.  Nothing about that sandwich was disappointing!!  

We decided to finish off our meal with a frozen hot chocolate.  How could you come to Serendipity and not have one of these??  It was definitely a great treat to end our meal but not the over the top taste that I had built myself up for.

Location? LOVE. Although it's right outside of Caesar's Palace and all by itself.

As far as the SERVICE?  Fail, FAIL, fail, fail - what a joke.  You have got to be kidding me.  No one knows WTF they're doing there or their purpose of working at that place is, everyone is completely disheveled and unorganized and probably high off of something.

Prices? EHH, not so much worth it. I'd rather eat a full meal (which I did beforehand) than spend way too much money for average food there.

I went there with 3 other people to get a taste of their frozen hot chocolate (I've heard wonders about it) and thank god that made up for the terrible service we received.  I've read on here that the wait time to be seated is obnoxious ... we didn't EVEN have to wait (maybe because it was a weekday).  In fact, the restaurant wasn't even CLOSE to being full, but we ended up waiting for SERVICE. Can't ever win with this restaurant, can you?

The hostess sat us down and we waited at our table right under the Serendipity poster (ooh so exciting, for me at least!) for about 10 minutes with about 3 waiters\/waitresses walking by our table multiple times.  Did anyone offer to take our order?  No.  We even managed to go out of our way from looking at the menu, to purposely lock eyes with the employees breezing on by, and NOT ONE WORD from any one of them.  I even saw from what looked like to be the manager, ""managing"" the kitchen (which is in plain view for customers).  It's too bad that that 'manager' obviously doesn't know how to manage their employees.  Thank you beautiful, Kate & John, for being so romantic on that poster hanging on the wall and for entertaining me for that 10 minutes of no service.

So, while attempting not to die from heat exhaustion, all 4 of us got up and walked to the bar.  You think if you physically got up and moved to a location with a bartender, you'd get some service.  Bahahaha, NO!  Not at all.  After 5 minutes of sitting at the bar with unpleasant facial expressions written across all of our faces, the bartender finally noticed us.  After he handed us menus, we told him that we had already sat down, no one helped us at the table so that's why we went to the bar, and we obviously already knew what we wanted to order.

\/\/\/ Bartender: ""Oooh, so you already sat down eh?  Oh well I'm sorry about that [obviously not in a genuine voice, more like a 'sucks to be you!' tone]. Well, you know there's more than those flavors listed on the menu for the frozen hot chocolate.  We have a menu just for the frozen hot chocolate flavors.""

I don't care if you have a WHOLE other menu just for frozen hot chocolate, I just wanted to order my double oreo frozen hot chocolate and indulge in its party-in-your-mouth taste.

After enjoying the frozen hot chocolate (which is huge, wish there was less whip cream in it) we ended up waiting another 10 minutes to get our bill ....... then another 5 minutes for the bartender flirting with the single chicks on the side of us to give us our bill ......... and another 5 minutes for him to take our credit cards and swipe them ........ and then, well, MORE WAITING.

I would only go back here IN DESPERATION to get the frozen hot chocolate because the experience was SHITTY and the food's EXTREMELY over-priced.

Every time I walk in without a reservation, there is a wait. Luckily, my bf and I scored a reservation when we checked in at the Information Desk for the High Roller. The staff easily booked a dinner reservation for a party of 2 for 8:00 p.m.

When we arrived at Serendipity 3, we were 15 minutes early. The host seated us right away. We ordered the frozen hot chocolate. It was delicious and enough for two people to share. We also ordered ""the one & only las vegas strip steak sandwich"" paired with wings. 

The steak sandwich included not only a 10 oz new york strip steak, but also eggs, cheddar on garlic french bread. It was overwhelming as some would expect and extremely greasy.  The sweet potatoes that came with the sandwich were underwhelming because they were lukewarm and not as crispy as I would like. The buffalo chicken wings were okay. The dressing nor the meats stood out. On top of the mediocre food, the service was slow. Our waiter only checked in on us once when I waved for the check. 

For the high price and fame of the NY's Serendipity cafe, I expected better from this place. After dinner, I felt that my $$ would have been better spent on a AYCE buffet than this place.

I'd heard so many good things about SERENDIPITY that it almost became impossible to keep up with the hype. I was in LV for work for over a week, and hit up Serendipity after several folks recommended it.

We waited about 30 minutes on a Friday night, which isn't that bad. We got a seat on the patio, facing the strip. I had the Meatball Pizza on the waiters recommendation, and quite frankly - I didn't like it. The ricotta was overpowering and made it hella soggy. He noticed I didn't really go in for the kill and asked if I liked it. I told him not really, and when the bill arrived, he scratched it from the total. I thought that was cool.

I also tried their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. While it was certainly delish, I thought it was just a milkshake with more ice? 

I'd definitely go back, but this place is basically Fenton's.

This is my favorite place to eat at on the strip.  Great food, excellent service and fun atmosphere.  We were there on a little vacay last week, and ate there twice.  The first time Kevin was our server.  The hostess promptly sat us with no wait, even though there was one, because we are diamond members.  She was super nice and so was Kevin.  They both remembered us when we came back 2 days later, and made a point to come over and ask us about our stay and activites we did.  The second time I think our server's name was Mylin.  She was super nice, and even though she was busy she took good care of us.

Let's start by saying that the Frozen Hot Chocolate is magical.

The first time I had a Serendipity Frozen Hot Chocolate was in New York City. I remember it clearly the first time I had one -- the wait to be seated, the shock that there is a minimum charge per person, and the GIANT Frozen Hot Chocolates coming out and instantly regretting not having ordered 1 to share between 2 people. Most importantly, I remember how delicious it was. Imagine an amazing hot chocolate but frozen and then melted down to the perfect temperature so it's like have a smoothie. That's what the Frozen Hot Chocolate is like.

On a hot summer day or even a cool winter night, it'll satiate all of your chocolate desires -- even the hot cocoa ones.

I also have tried some of their other drinks, including the Amaretto Almond Hot Chocolate. I'm going to be honest and just say that I think the classic, Frozen Hot Chocolate is still their best. Definitely their star dish in my opinion. 

If you've never been to one of the famous Serendipity restaurants, I'd recommend stopping by for the Frozen Hot Chocolate. You can grab one from the bar window outside if you don't want to sit inside.",0,0,0

So I finally get a chance to come to serendipity3. Had dinner on a Saturday night around 7:30pm but had a 30min wait so we didn't get seated till about 8:05pm.

We ordered an appetizer of potato skins (there was 8 per order). The presentation was cute. It had 3 tiers. 1st tier was the dipping sauce plus sour cream, chives, etc. 2nd and 3rd tier were a plate of potato skins. That cost $11

We shared the meatball and mozerella pizza. The portion was good enough to share...and since we had an appetizer beforehand, we were half full. That cost $15.

Overall, the food was just whatevers. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious...but for that amount of money...WASN'T WORTH IT. Its hard to mess up on potato skins and the pizza, eh...it was good.

We can't come here without trying to frrrozen hot chocolate. 
We ordered a mint frrrozen hot chocolate and a peanut butter cup milkshake $10 and $11 respectively. In MY opinion, it was nothing special. It SOUNDS neat but really, my mint frrrozen hot chocolate tasted like a mint milkshake. If you put a serendipity3 frozen hot chocolate and a jack in the box milkshake next to me, blindfold my eyes and ask me which is which, i wouldn't be able to tell. What's even more disappointing is THE PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! $10 FOR AN EFFIN MILKSHAKE is just not worth it. You're better off buying a delicious concoction at Fat Tuesday instead.

Overall, the food is NOT WORTH the price. Same goes with their famous frozen hot chocolate. Come here if you have some extra money to spend. This place is not for budget friendly folks.

We first went to the express line and said no whip cream on all of them and what happens? Whip cream on every single drink. The express line has the worse tasting nacho and chips. I wouldn't even eat them if they were free! 

I was very unhappy so I asked for us to be seated this time.  We ordered another frozen hot chocolate w\/out whip cream and what happens again?? Whip cream! By this time we were annoyed. So, I was super excited to get my nachos with sour cream meat guacamole. What happens? The meat is SOOOO SALTY. We took 2 bites and we couldn't even eat anymore.

Since the 6th times were decent, I give you a 3 star. It did make me not want to come back after the 7th time. Sadness.

Tip: if you're going to just get the famous frozen hot chocolate the express line is WAY FASTER and even gives you more.  I thought that it was less but when I poured the hot chocolate from eating at a restaurant it was way less.

So Express line for drinks is way more worth it!",1,1,1

She couldn't tell me why the other slider on the children's plate was cooked through.  Listen lady, I wasn't asking for a refund or comp... a simple apology would have done.  The attitude you were so intent on handing me? Not necessary.

To top it off, when my daughter became fussy at the end of the meal and started crying, this same lame waitress proceeded to hang out at my elbow exclaiming ""What's wrong with her?!?"" for a full five minutes.

The place is cute if you're into girly stuff: pink, beanie babies, totes, chocolate, desserts, etc.  They have indoor and patio seating.  I'd rather sit inside because the view from the patio isn't all that wonderful: ruins of Bill's Gambling Saloon, Flamingo and Hot Babes Direct to You mobile billboard passing by every few minutes.

I like their desserts (Deep Fried Oreos and Ice Cream, Black and White Sundae, Banana Split, Red Velvet Sundae)  only if I'm with a group because their portions are huuuuge and I don't feel like spending 5 hours at the gym trying to burn the calories from their desserts! Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is a must-have though - but again, it's meant to be shared.

For their savory items, I've tried their Ahi Tuna Salad (wishing it had negative calories to lower my caloric intake from the hot chocolate! Ha!), ABC Burger (avocado, brie and caramelized onions), Foot Long, Egg White Frittata, Chicken and Waffles and their High Heel Pump (prosciutto, arugula, mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, pesto and balsamic Glaze).  I've always wanted to try their Foot Long Haute Dog with gold leaf, truffles and foie gras but they only have it their New York shop (which was closed due to rat infestation the last time I went).

With Serendipity, I'm guilty of my willingness to pay for cute, the name (which the movie was named after and a portion was filmed) but mediocre food. I still like them for their Frrrozen Hot Chocolate.",8,7,6

I have ALWAYS wanted to try their Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. 

(This review is way overdue.) My husband and I came here the last time we were in Vegas. They have a breakfast and lunch menu. I ordered the original Frrrozen Hot Chocolate at $12 and my husband ordered the Thai Beef Salad at $18. The Thai Beef Salad is made up of Marinated skirt steak, iceberg, Napa cabbage, cilantro, jalapenos, tomato, Asian pickle, Thai sesame dressing, nestled in a coconut shell.

Overall, our bill came out to over $30 for a frozen hot chocolate and a salad. To be quite honest, the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate was a total let down. It didn't really have a rich chocolate burst of flavor nor did it have a nice icy or creamy consistency. The consistency was actually kind of chalky\/powdery.
The Thai Beef salad was decent and had good flavors, but the portion wasn't that big and it was quite pricey to top it off. The service was just okay.

At least I can say I've been here and tried it. But the Chocolate Blast a Baskin Robins is so much better in comparison (which is kind of sad). 

Anyway, I don't think I'll ever return.

Imagine to my surprise a Serendipity3 would find its way west onto the Strip. Thanks to the success of that awful movie of the same name, I remember having to wait hours just to get into the tourist-famous NY original. And so yes, I did get excited upon discovery a Las Vegas location has opened up. I wanted to relive the Frozen Hot Chocolate experience again... yeah I'm lame.

But this Serendipity is unlike the charming lil shop 'round the corner found in NY. For one, it's made bigger to accommodate the people walking through Caesar's, and it seems the menu has swelled to a myriad of food options. It's also eccentrically...pink throughout. This is what happens when you take a popular dessert shop and go Hollywood - you milk the name and turn it into a more accessible, tourist-friendly location (read: Instant $$ generator).

Of course, while here you have to get their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate, which is really just a iced chilled chocolate smoothie to share.  At $8.50 it's not cheap, but hey you're in Vegas; that's only one less hand of blackjack to play. And man is it good... 108 degree summer weather good. I even came back the next day and got it to-go from their outside take-out window. Sure some may find it overhyped, but I like it so shut up. If you're not impressed, there's a Fat Tuesday around the corner to get wasted...

The prices for food may be tad high, but the portions are big to go along with it. The foot long NY hotdog is, indeed, a foot long and for $11, it comes with waffle fries and a line of condiments to sprinkle on top. The steak sandwich (~$20) can be shared between 2. It's huge...that's what she said.

So for pure convenience, Serendipity is a easy destination to check out while you're on the Strip. You won't get the true experience of the original, but who cares? Chances are you'll be too drunk already to care. Plus I hated the movie!",4,2,3

I assured them that the last time I ordered a hangover omelette, only 1\/3 of it was eaten and that was a time when I felt like I could eat a horse.

They gave in and we followed our waitress in awe of the restaurant (yes, I am still fascinated by the decorations and all that pink!)

The frozen hot chocolate was great.  The pretzel was a big ""S"" shaped pretzel (which was cool), but I expected a nice warn, soft pretzel.  Nope, it was just a cold pretzel.  It was disappointing.

On top of that, the ice cream used in the shakes, cones, and sundaes is Ben and Jerry's.  Uh, you are a fancy schmancy ice cream shop and you don't make your own ice cream?

We were seated quickly but the music was so loud inside we couldn't hear each other or the waiter (and no we are not old and we regularly attend rock concerts). So we moved outside. Same thing. Terribly loud. You had to shout at each other. We didn't even make it to the food. Had a $4 iced tea and left. Didn't enjoy the atmosphere at all. Really targeted at the tween audience.

The only thing worth trying is their Frozen hot chocolate.. But other then that... Complete disappointment!!!! Guys.. It's rare that I get this mad over food.. But we literally sat down and waited 20 mins for a server to come by and ask what we'd like to drink.. (And she wasn't even our server for the section!) this girl who we finally were able to wave down.. Had said she would go get our server... 10 mins later.. She came back and said ""you still haven't been helped?"" And decided to just help us.. We over heard her asking another server where the server for our table was... That right there...

Anyway. We finally got to order.. We decided to share the steak sandwich.. That I see everyone getting... And the frozen hot chocolate as dessert... After ordering we waited what seemed like forever for our food to come out.. They bring us.. The frozen hot chocolate first.. (That's dessert.. What in the world?!) at this point I was so hungry I didn't care anymore., we downed that frozen hot chocolate in less then 5 mins! Our steak sandwich finally came out.. It's really big.. So plan on sharing. But after reading this.. Hopefully you don't even bother to waste your money! This steak sandwich is served on a long baguette that is cut in half.. Then it has two pieces of steak, bacon and an over easy egg on top. Now.. If you the plate looks pretty darn good. But when you eat it.. Your opinion will go south pretty quick! It was like biting into rubber! We couldn't even bite the sandwich. The baguette was hard as a rock.. And the steak was so chewy and rubber.. It was ridiculous.. We had to start using a knife to cut it into small pieces just to eat... And not only that.. We asked for a Medium well steak... My piece came out MOO-ing to me! It was so bloody.. I felt like a vampire .. The blood started dripping and made my bread look all bloody.. I couldn't even eat it! My bf had to switch with me cause his piece was actually cooked correctly.. Ugh! Such a bad experience...

The service here is horrible.. If you read a review on bad service.. It's cause it is! They run around looking so busy.. But I seriously don't see them doing anything.. And the food here is just plain horrible! Forgot to mention this is my 3rd time here... Everytime their food just gets more & more disappointing... STICK TO DESSERT HERE! It's also super pricey!

The dine-in experience I would give a 4 star while the to-go menu was disappointing and deserved a 3 star.

As for the dine-in, we waited about 40 minutes and they gave us a hand held alarm to notify us when we were ready to go up.  We had a party of 8 the first time and the interior is brightly decorated with a lot of pink.

We were seated and then proceeded to order drinks.  We came around noon so they still had the breakfast menu.  It goes until 2pm.  Anyhow, some of the people in my party ordered a few alcoholic drinks which they seemed to enjoy.  The real winner was the food.  The orders I remember were the steak sandwich and the waffles topped with all sorts of berries.  

The steak sandwich wasn't of the greatest quality but none the less, the size and presentation was impressive.  The bread was a little hard and hard to bite and hurt the roof of my mouth a little.  It also came with egg, bacon and of course, the steak.  All in all, it was an enjoyable and tasty dish which was big enough to feed at least two people.  That's not even including the french fries that came with it. 

I also ordered waffles with berries on top along with caramel and whipped cream i believe.   As for that, they were decent waffles.  Not the best I've had, but similar to the steak sandwich, they were of large quantity.

Service was great.  Our waitress was very polite, had a great sense of humor, and very prompt.  I think her name was Candace.

As for my second experience, it was pretty lousy in comparison.  3 of my friends and I went to the to-go window and ordered a few frozen drinks, hot dogs, and nachos.  We ordered the chili cheese hot dog, hot dog with sour kraut, frozen hot chocolate, and a berry smoothie.  The hot dogs were very disappointing because both the quality and the presentation were not to the level of what we'd expect.  I'd rather go to Pink's Hot Dog stand which had a more delicious hot dog at a lower price.  The smoothie I had tasted fine but didn't justify the $10 price that came with it.

We came here for brunch while we were in Vegas for a mini vacation and we liked it! We were sat right away and the employees were all very friendly. The restaurant is super cute and the vibe is very colorful diner-like. The only reason why I am giving this restaurant 3 stars instead of more is because it took a really long time to get our food. The server was very prompt with our drink orders and coming back to take our orders but it was just a wait to actually get the food. Once the food arrived, it was very tasty. The portions are HUGE. You literally could split one meal between 2 people. We ordered the fried chicken tenders\/waffles and the hangover omelet. I wasn't really a fan of french fries being added to the omelet but that was just my personal preference. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely go back to try the desserts which looked AMAZING! Give them a shot!

I hope this review helps you decide on where to catch a good delicious brunch while in Vegas! :)",3,2,1

Very pink and girly, which isn't usually my thing but it worked here. And I fell in love with the sundae-shaped topiary covered in lights that was outside. And the curvy, womanly torso-shaped hostess stand.

Definitely try the frozen hot chocolate. I would recommend splitting it with someone, unless you are serious about your frozen drinks. I ordered the Raspberry Truffle, which was a frozen hot chocolate the size of my head, with alcohol, and piled high with whipped cream. Add in the chocolate shavings and raspberries, and I did not need dessert.

For dinner, I picked the foot-long chili cheese dog. Looking at the menu, there were quite a few things I would have picked. But I had a burger that morning at 5 (long night) and had pizza for lunch, so I went with the hot dog. Bad choice. It was huge (I'm talking circumference). There was no way I was picking that thing up to take a bite. Which is probably why they serve it with a big knife. The hot dog was also really salty. I couldn't eat more than 3 or 4 bites. The waffle fries are a must, though. The sweet potato fries are also good, but the waffle fries win in my book. One friend ordered a cheeseburger and enjoyed it. Another friend had the grilled cheese with tomato soup and also liked her food. So, I'd just stay away from the foot-longs.

The food and drinks were a little pricey, but not when you consider you're eating in Vegas, right on the strip. 

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely go back for dessert. And maybe to share a frozen hot chocolate.",0,0,1

For those who are interested in coming here for the ""frozen hot chocolate"" they have two sizes available, the 10 ounce (for one)  for $10 and 16 ounce (for two) for $14, I decided to go with the 16 ounce which was more than enough for me. Our waitress was really nice, and got our order in real quick, and when they brought my drink I couldn't wait to dive in. I started drinking it through the straw and could only taste the frozen chocolate, a tip to those first timers, the hot chocolate is on top so it's best to use a spoon to scoop from the bottom so you can get the combination of both hot and cold. The ""frozen hot chocolate"" was good, I don't think it exceeded my expectations but was definitely good and I would have it again.

A group of friends and I came here because we were so undecided about what to do on a friday night since we were not clubbing. I keep hearing about the frozen hot chocolate and the $1,000 sundae and $69 hot dog! ( which I hope to try soon! ) 
Since I didn't have $1,000 to splurge and I didn't hear about the hot dog until recently, I got the crab cakes which was good. It had a good amount of crabs and the sauce complimented the crab cakes very well. From the looks of it, a spoonful of salad with two good size of crab cakes didn't look like it would fill me up at all, but it did! I also got to try a proscuitto sandwich and that was also pretty good! The bread had a nice and soft texture, and the veggies were fresh. Their alfredo is also pretty good too!

The one thing I didn't care too much for was their frozen hot chocolate. We got the popular flavor which was the peanut butter one with a shot of alcohol. ( I forgot what alcohol ) It was good, but I just feel like I was eating reese's peanut butter ice cream with alcohol and I could get that for 4 bucks a carton at albertsons and just add a shot of baileys to it.

In that, when she bought out coffee, she did not offer any milks or sugars, but when asked, she was like: Of course! And went to get the items. This was a recurring theme.

We shared a BBQ chicken pizza which was enough to fill our bellies. However, the flavor of the pizza was lacking. I asked for parmesan cheese and red chili flakes when the pizza was brought out (normally, those items are brought out as soon as you place your order). She came back with just the chili flakes. I wasn't even about to ask for Sriracha, since they probably didn't have it (they did not have sugar in the raw for our coffees). My hot water tasted weird.

So yeah, the dining-in experience was just eh and due to that I wasn't interested in ordering their famous frozen hot chocolate and having to endure sitting any longer.

My friends and I decided to come here during lunch and to our surprise Holly Madison! We were in awe and complete shock when we saw her! She was there for the 1 year anniversary of this Serendipity location. We were completely star struck due to the fact that she was sitting at the table right next to us! Anyways, back to the food..

I ordered the TBLT (Turkey bacon lettuce and tomato) sandwich with the Sweet potato fries. The portion was pretty big and I was unable to finish my sandwich and fries. The Sweet potato fries were the best that I've ever had. They were crunchy and also had some sort of brown sugar on top of it, to give it a much sweeter taste. By the time I was finished with half of my sandwich and fries, my friend Jenn and I shared a Frozen Hot Chocolate. When it arrived, there was some chocolate drowning at the bottom of the plate. It was good and very filling. I was stuffed by the end of that meal. 

The service was good considering the fact that we were surrounded by paparazzi. Our waiter was very attentive and quick. This place was a little pricey, but it's on the strip so nothing is really cheap.",0,0,0

I have heard about this place for, forever, and I had no idea they had a restaurant in Vegas. So, of course, from the moment I saw that it was across from our hotel I was dead set on it. Frozen Hot Chocolate? Hot Chocolate is way high up on my list of vices\/obsessions and I was way over due for one with it being summer. 

I made a point to grab one despite being super busy and didn't even bother to look at the menu for anything else, I mean, a signature is your signature for a reason. I ordered from the take out window and there was no wait, they whipped it up right away.

And what did they whip up? What tastes like powdered hot chocolate mix and ice and milk? This thing. The whipped cream was good, and there were some good white chocolate shavings on top, but that was it. I figured when I ordered it that it would be too sweet to finish (even though I got the small) and I was right. I think the big thing was that it wasn't worth finishing. 

My friend took one sip and said ""gross"" but I made it half way through. Was it ok? Yeah. Would I pay $10 again? No way. If someone gave it to me and I wanted chocolate I would probably drink it though. Oh snap. That was a bad review.

The only reason it gets 2 stars is that I hold out hope that the normal food menu is better.",0,1,0

Definitely a great place to try, especially for those first timers and sweet tooths. It is surprisingly not as busy as you would expect, and while they are more famous for their sundaes and cold drinks, they also have really good food, like their sliders. 

I always come for the frozen hot chocolate. As the name entails, it tastes like a thick hot chocolate that is blended to make it a cold frozen slush. It is topped with fresh whip cream, which is my favorite. This time I got the mint frozen hot chocolate, which had a slight minty taste that was not overpowering and was refreshing, and topped with an Andes mint chocolate. 
We also got the deep fried oreo sundae, and it was exactly what we expected- really good! The fried oreos honestly made our day. A total heart attack, but a total pleasure. 

The waiter (I forgot his name , I am sorry) was really friendly and made an effort to help us decide on certain items. Also he was patient and would come by often to make sure our needs were met, and were satisfied with our time there.",0,0,0

I loved the theme they have going on, their decorations and I even thought their way-over-sized menus were cool.  The service started off really well.  We were seated immediately and our server was very friendly and peppy.  I think she knew it was our first time so she helped to hype things up for us.  However, the service slowly went downhill as she failed to check on us.  We had to get her attention and not the other way around.  I know it got busy while we were there and maybe she had a few too many tables to wait on but it took forever to get her to come back to the table and also took forever for her to give us our bill.  

I had the Peanut Butter Frozen Hot Chocolate which was really yummy but deceiving.  The portion looks huge and comes in a large glass bowl but there was seriously more whipped cream than hot chocolate in the serving.  It was also a little pricey-a little over $10.  It would be worth it if I had gotten more frozen hot chocolate than whipped cream.  

My friend had the frozen hot chocolate as well and noticed the same thing-way too much whipped cream.  She also ordered the chili, which in my opinion was very good but also very spicy.  She didn't enjoy it at all and barely touched it because of the spiciness.  Nowhere on the menu did it mention that the chili was spicy.  Again, deceiving.  Even though the chili was good, the menu should have specified that it's spicy because not all patrons enjoy spicy food.  We complained to our server and she did have it taken off the bill.    

I would definitely return to Serendipity and try other things on their menu.  I would also ask for light whipped cream, or maybe hold the whipped cream altogether just to see if they will give more frozen hot chocolate that way.  Maybe our server had an off day which is why service turned out to be slow, who knows?  I think they're worth the second chance.

We ended up ordering another frozen hot chocolate inside so that it was in the glass which is a better experience than a to go cup. The frozen hot chocolate was pretty good. We are such fatties and it was breakfast time too. We also ordered the ""I Thought I Saw a Wabbit"" which has Vanilla & Butter Pecan Ice Cream, Heavenly Carrot Cake, Maple Walnut & White Chocolate Fudge, Topped with Whipped Cream.

The Frozen hot chocolate is one of their specialties but IMO it was a more glorified chocolate milk shake that tends to run on the liquid-y side. Plus it's very sweet and you'll get tired of the taste since its pretty big so its encouraged to share it with another person or two. 

My favorite over there is the Let Them Eat Cake which is this ginormous layered cake filled with chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry ice cream. The layers are of confetti cake I believe, and it is AMAZING. (Thank you Duff Goldman from showing me this cake from the Best Thing I've Ever Ate! And when the Ace of Cakes himself tells you to try a cake... You gotta try the cake.) I'm from LA so when I was in town for Vegas I was looking forward to trying it out.

I guess it's a good thing this restaurant is in Las Vegas, because I was already expecting to spend exorbitant amounts of money on really stupid things that I would grow to regret, and that's exactly what I did.

I was looking forward to trying a frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity 3. I love dessert, and it was about 6,000 degrees outside. The restaurant was conveniently located just outside of our hotel, so we trudged our way over and placed our orders at the take-out window in the back (for those customers who are not in the mood for a sit-down meal). We then forked over $11 each, received our drinks (the basic Frrrozen Hot Chocolate) and trudged over to the seating area closest to the water misters.

Maybe it would have been better to sit down and order inside the restaurant. Who knows? All I know is that I was very saddened by my frozen hot chocolate. Because that sounds really fancy! That sounds like it should be exotic and delicious! But after a sip or two, it dawned on me that we'd totally just spent $11 on a glorified chocolate milkshake that was probably worth $2-3 at most.

We put our names down and waited about 10mins or so and saw that a group that had came after us taken to sit at the bar! My friend asked how come they got seated before us. The hostess informed us we could jump right in there if we see any avail seats! Well, that would have been nice to know!!! Lucky for us not long after, a couple were leaving so my friend and i hopped on it like flies to poop!

I ordered the Frrrrozen hot chocolate ($10) while my friend ordered the Frrrozen oreo hot chocolate ($14). We planned on eating at a different place after so we decided to share a BLT sandwich w.fries ($16). 

It was nice to sit at the bar as our frozen hot chocolate was made right in front of us. It consisted of cocoa, milk, ice, and i believe sugar was mixed in there also. It gets nicely blended and topped with a ginormous amount of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. My friend's frozen oreo hot chocolate was topped with pieces of oreos and a piece of chocolate egg roll on each side. I guess that's what an extra $4 gets you. 

As soon as i took a sip, I literally jizzed in my pants. Ok, not really. But it was damn good! It was not too sweet - just the perfect amount of sweetness, just perfect. I took a sip of the frozen oreo hot chocolate and it was just as good maybe even a tad bit better! It was a little more on the sweeter side though...so I prefer the original over the oreo.

Moments later, our sandwich comes out and my goodness i was not expecting the BLT to be so huge! - probably a 6 x 6 cut in half...or even bigger! There were thinnly slices of turkey which was stacked to about 3 inches thick (I'm not even kidding), topped with crispy, smoked bacon (sooo good), lettuce, tomatos, the usual...everything tasted so fresh and just soooo good! 

I'm so glad we stayed and waited. Now we must try Serendipity in NYC!

There was a short wait but we went and explored Caesars while we waited.

We first ordered the Frozen Oreo Hot Chocolate.  After a while it finally came out and it was HUGE.  We could have shared one.  By the time we had finished the whipped cream part we were full.

My boyfriend ordered the bigger than your head pancakes.  He was very pleased with them but the review was right - they were HUGE! He only got through about 1\/2 a stack before giving up.

I ordered the Lucky 7s breakfast which came with 3 eggs, 2 sausage, 2 pancakes, and potatoes.  Coming from Jersey, I eat that kind of meal all the time at the local diners so I figured I could handle it.  I was wrong.  It was so big I barely made a dent. It was really good but I wasted a lot of food that morning.

As for the service, our waiter was average.  Many previous reviews complain about slow service- from what I noticed Las Vegas as a whole is EXTREMELY slow.  I am used to a fast paced Jersey\/ NY atmosphere so everywhere we went was torturous.  It should never take 30-45 minutes to bring out a stack of pancakes and eggs.

Most people who spend money on the strip are people on vacation.  I don't know about you, but I don't like wasting my vacation standing around.

There was a coupon for a free frozen hot chocolate with the purchase of an entree, so I went to check it out.  I've seen pictures, and it looked so large and delicious.

Turns out, there was an hour wait to be seated.  I opted to forgo the coupon, and stand at the walk-thru window instead.  Horrible decision.

There were two parties ahead of me, but there were only two workers, so they took the order, made the order, then served the next customer.  The wait took over a HOUR.  I've never had such a horrible wait.  

When I got the frozen hot chocolate, I ordered the one for 2.  It didn't look as large in a dinky plastic cup.  In fact, they only put about 2\/3s of what they put in the blender in my cup.

The hot chocolate was good, but it wasn't worth the price.  It tasted cheap, like powdered hot chocolate, and blended ice.  I've tasted better frozen hot chocolates, and they are generally made with syrup, for a creamier more integrated flavor.

What was delivered in front of me was a giant. I am certain that this is NOT the same cake that I had in NYC. If you have been to Claim Jumper's, it is reminiscent of the Motherlode. I did not come to Serendipity to gorge on a 2 pound slice of chocolate cake, heavily layered with frosting. Nearby patrons gaped at the cake and took photos with their large lenses as I attempted to make a dent into this monster of a slice.

Sadly, size was not the only difference. It tasted like a cake I could buy at Safeway for 3 dollars. And the Safeway ones are more satisfactory because I don't expect much. It was just sweet, the frosting was uninspired, and there was just TOO MUCH. What a disaster. I ended up taking the unfinished half back to the hotel.

The manager was great and showed appreciation of the feedback but replied that our specific server had received numerous complaints.

I came here for my birthday a couple months ago, and the frozen hot chocolate still sticks out in my mind.  Our group got seated within 15 minutes and we got seated right on the patio!  Which meant, we go to people watch O.O (my favorite) :)

Our server was REALLY nice, really attentive and got us in and out JUST in time for our Blue Man Group Show...we were running SERIOUSLY behind schedule and he was so efficient and understanding.

This place would be best for if you just want something to satisfy your sweet tooth or for lunch.  I wouldn't call their menu selection dinner food appropriate.  Andrew D. and I got an omelette for our dinner! Lol..it was really good and presentation was really nice!

Did you know there is actually a dessert on there for I think $1,000?!  It has real gold in\/on it.  Unbelievable!~  Just stick to the Frozen Hot Chocolate though!  It is enough to fill 2 people!  And I'll be coming back here again soon cause I have more things on the menu to try!!",3,1,1

I ate at the LV location 1.5 years ago and had a great experience, but this time ruined its reputation for me. I also am a frequent diner at the original NY restaurant, so it's upsetting that this establishment shares the same quality name.

Came to eat a late lunch here last Saturday around 3pm. I was meeting up with some friends and was the first one to arrive, so I put my name down. We had a party of 7, so when she said it would be an hour wait, that seemed reasonable since the place was packed. However, then she said that they ran out of buzzers and that I should just wait in the area for my name to be called. Wait around for a HOUR? When I can walk around Cesar's Palace instead?? I wasn't happy but I complied and the waiting began.

Since it was 3pm, and I hadn't eaten much that day and I had to wait around the restaurant, I decided to order a snack at the take-out window. Figured I would split a hot dog with my boyfriend while we waited since I was starving, and then when we were seated in a hour, I would order something lighter to complete my lunch. The take out window was super slow and inefficient but they guy serving us at the window provided good conversation. As I was waiting for my hot dog at the pick-up window, I hear my name called at the restaurant. WTF??? It had only been 20 minutes.

The hostess gave me attitude because she had been calling me name. Hey lady, what do you expect when you don't give me a buzzer!!! I explained to her that my party was ready but that I had just ordered a hot dog at Serendipity Take-Out and asked if I could bring it into the restaurant. She said NO and that she could seat the rest of my party but that she couldn't seat me if I wanted to bring in a hot dog. Even though my friends hadn't ordered any food yet and I had bought the hot dog from Serendipity, she wouldn't budge. So I canceled the whole table and my friends and I just ordered more food from Take-Out. 

The whole ordeal just makes no sense. (1) Why would the hostess say the wait was an hour and then be able to seat us in 20 minutes?, (2) Why can't you bring Serendipity take-out into the restaurant if you are still going to buy food at the restaurant? And it's ALL THE SAME PLACE!,  (3) Serendipity is not some pretentious nightclub.",6,1,1

I've seen this place every time I have walked down the strip and always see it on tv on various shows. So I wanted to try it this time before I left. 

The place seemed busy but there wasn't a ton of people inside maybe 70% full. The reservationist is in a awkward place outside that you would normally walk by. I saw every person walk by her in fact and they walk back outside to get on the wait list. I know it's not just me, every person walked by, I state again. 

They had flat pepsi which was due to them being out of ice, which they should have gave us free sodas for. Also your in vegas, on the strip, it's hot. LETS PLAN OUR ICE USAGE better! 

Food was good, big portions and tasty. 

Had a fun time trying to get refills and most of all change. The hosts didn't have access to the registers and the bartender was too good to give us the time of day. We had to stop another server to finally get change, at that point I didn't even want to leave a tip for the server I was getting change for.

This place is a major tourist trap. I guess it was alright for a one time kitschy\/novelty thing, but I won't be coming back anytime soon and here's why:

- The food was way overpriced and there was nothing different or impressive about it at all. Had the frozen hot chocolate for 2 ($14), chicken not so little soup ($10) and cheeseburger with steak fries ($16). The frozen hot chocolate is just like iced hot chocolate with whipped cream and slivers of chocolate sprinkled on top...you can get something very similar or even better at starbucks (chocolate chip frappuccino) or jamba juice (chocolate moo'd) for less than half the cost, or just go to 7-Eleven and buy a bottle of yoo-hoo. The soup portion was tiny, like the size of a regular coffee mug. The cheeseburger was slightly burnt, although the steak fries was probably the best part of the whole meal. To be fair, I guess prices are standard for this part of the strip but the food was just so mediocre...Kinda like a crappier version of Cheesecake Factory food with less variety to choose from. I will give them credit for coming up with creative names for menu items, but that's just another part of the marketing gimmick.

- Wait time to get seated took forever. We were originally told wait time would be an hour and a half. After waiting for about 45 minutes, we overheard the hostess telling another couple that outside seating on the patio was available immediately. Outdoor seating was not originally offered to us and we wasted 45 minutes of precious gambling\/shopping time! Tip: if hostess tells you a ridiculously long wait time to get a table, ask to sit at the bar (for smaller parties) or an outdoor table (although it can get cold even with the heat lamps).

- Service time took forever again. Come on...an order of soup and a cheeseburger...how basic can you get? It really shouldn't take over half an hour.

Save yourself 2+ hours and $50+...Don't get sucked into the hype! This place is popular only because their cutesy name is still riding the coat tail fame of a 9 year old movie...sad!",5,3,0

First off, they have a brunch menu which is served until 2pm, which means you can't order off the regular menu until that time.  This is a bit of an annoyance because the selection is limited and due to dietary restrictions it's a bit difficult.  We did ask if we could order off the other menu and they said no!

The food selection isn't insanely creative, it's mostly fries, burgers, salads, pancakes that sort of thing.  The decor is what make serendipity fun to eat at, not the food itself.

We spoke with the guy behind the sliding glass window and he told us that they could not make anything else because they had already begun to clean up for other night.  We pointed out the time and he said and I quote ""ya, sorry"".  We did get him to sell us a frozen hot chocolate and a diet Pepsi.  

The frozen hot chocolate tastes like a fudge flavored Popsicle, pretty good but not worth the 10 bucks they charged for it.

I preface this because I've been to the location in NY and waited an hour to get a table there. Once I had the desserts at the NY location I see why, it was worth the wait!

The Vegas location had a 1-hour long wait, we opted to go to the express line and that went fairly quick. Go to the pick-up window if you are short on time.

We had the On the Go Banana Split, some huge foot-long hot dog and some frozen hot chocolate drink.

The food is pretty good it fills the bill, desserts are their forte. Would I come back yes, it a novelty thing.

The portions for the frozen hot-chocolate are big enough for 3 to 4 people.

I recommend making reservation if you like to eat inside. If you eat outside there is a big tent so have somebody in your group stake out a table while somebody places the order. My point, it gets crowded here fast.

Kid-friendly - yes.
Fun with groups - yes

Parking - at one near by casinos. If you park at the Caesars self-park you will have to navigate through the casino, just ask one of the staff members on how to get to this place.

I've had the kobe sliders, crab cake salad, thai beef salad, caesar salad, seasonal ahi taco appetizers.

The crab cake salad is my favorite of them all, the crab cake is really moist and creamy. Another one of my must have appetizer is their ahi tuna tacos, but they're only seasonal. It's raw chunks of tuna with a sweet salsa on mini hard shell tacos. 

Every time I come to Vegas, I have to stop by. The restaurant is super cute and makes me feel like I'm in my dream play house. The service is always great. The only bad thing about Serendipity 3 is the wait to be seated and the prices are a bit pricey, but hey you're in Vegas.",2,0,1

We were also intrigued by the decor and all of the sundaes on the menu.  There was a wait (20 minutes) so we grabbed a beer nearby.  We got seated in about 10 minutes and the waitress handed us menus but no hot dogs were featured on it.  FAIL!!!

I remarked that the menu posted outside listed a selection of hot dogs and asked if they could serve me one anyway.  I got a very quick ""NO.""  Not the way to do business folks.  She should have checked with the kitchen before abruptly answering me.  I am sure they could have done it.  Any other time, we would have left but we were hungry.  We ended up ordering wings to split and a sundae to split.  The portions we were seeing looked enormous.   Our wings arrived and they were very good.  The wait on the sundae was beyond slow.  I had to ask several times and she kept telling me it would be right up (I ordered a peanut butter sundae with hot fudge and marshmallow).  In the midst of the wait, there was also a waitress change and I had to ask her to check on the sundae.  FINALLY, the sundae came out and it was also very good.  Portions were easily ample enough to split between two people.

We each got three different ones - mocchaccino, white chocolate and the oreo frozen hot chocolates. I absolutely adored it, and it made me feel like a kid again! The white chocolate one was a tad sweeter than the others.

We also tried the food. I split a steak sandwich with eggs and bacons on top, and it was so huge! We couldn't even take a bite out of it, that we ended up eating each part separately. My other friend ordered a chicken sandwich with argula and other things, and it looked more appetizing than that sandwich. We also got sweet potato fries, which was the [second] best part of the meal.

The service was below average. The waiters and waitresses were not helpful in directing us to the hostess, and we stood by the door for 5 minutes before we approached a waitress about seating. Then we were directed outside to the real hostess. The wait was not too bad considering it was a Friday night, and we were instantly seated inside since it was less crowded.

My favorite is the regular frozen hot chocolate and the frozen mint hot chocolate. Make sure you are SHARING because the portion is quite large and sweet. The regular one is yummy, but because it's so sweet, I have a hard time finishing the whole thing. I like the mint one because it's not as sweet, so I can drink more of it :)

The location is right on the strip. The ambiance is very bright. Orange and pink galore! It sort of has a diner feel but a little more upscale than the typical diner. 
The menu has a nice variety. First off is the frozen hot chocolates. They have a lot of different flavors. I got the chocolate peanut butter. My friend got the white chocolate. Both were delicious. Huge portions! The small one was plenty enough to share. It was super rich, pilled high with whipping cream and drizzled with peanut butter. Very sugary of course but still delicious. 
The main courses include pastas, pizzas, burgers, salads, and sandwiches. A nice spread of choices. I had the spaghetti and meatballs. The portion size was nice. The taste was just alright. Meatballs were a little dry and the sauce was okay but not too spectacular. The price was little high but everything on the strip seems to be pretty expensive so nothing different from other spots close by. 
I recommend the outside seating. It is great for people watching :)",0,0,0

Their restaurant menu didn't seem worth the wait. 

Outside the line wasn't moving that quickly. I was hoping their food was at least o.k. I had a nagging feeling this might not be the case. I should've listened to my instinct. I got their signature frozen hot chocolate and pretzel with cheese. My friend got cheesy fries. Another friend got nachos. The frozen hot chocolate tasted like a bad chocolate slushy.

So when we sat down, we were just chatting and taking pictures, 15 minutes later we noticed that there was no server that came to visit us yet... I said to my group that they might be really busy and we can wait a little bit more.  At that same time, another group of customers just sat in a table not too far from us.  And their server came in an instant to introduce her self.

So I had to stand up and walk over to the front again to let them know that nobody has helped us yet.  The girl in the front apologized and a minute later our server came but didn't introduce herself, she said right away ""can i start you guys off with anything to drink?""

My boyfriend is an avid half marathon & marathon runner. This is his fun run of the year. He will sign up every year for as long as he can run & I will attend all events associated with the Rock N Roll Las Vegas for how ever long they will offer the VIP Spectator option. During this day the restaurant is closed to the public & only the VIPs are allowed in. To help the staff differentiate the VIP from regular patrons, we are asked to wear bracelets. 

Serendipity 3 is a great location as it is on the strip & located right in front of Ceasars Palace where both the marathon & half marathon races finish.

The set up at this location is beautiful & it gets better each year. There is a covered outdoor patio with tables covered in table cloths & center pieces of roses & hydrangeas. There are also comfortable sofas, plush chairs & pillows. The patio can be cold but there are heaters above to keep you warm. I advise all to bring jackets\/coats & scarves as this is the dessert & when it's not hot, it's usually cold. Today it is cold, windy & starting to sprinkle. 

They have a number of different dishes, platters of food, drink, dessert & even a pasta station. Oh, and all of it is free because that is included in the price for the VIP status. 

The food is phenomenal! You can eat until you can not eat anymore! The staff is super friendly & accommodating.

My lowly review is unlikely to have any effect on the patronage of this over-hyped, over-crowded and over-priced tourist trap.  

$15 for a double frozen hot chocolate?  Shame on me for giving into hype.  I feel like I got slapped silly and got called Susan.  It was kind of like a chocolate shake with ice chunks.  

My buddy had the ""coward's"" banana split.  For $14.  It looked to me like a big...banana split.  That cost $14.  Last I checked, I bananas and ice cream don't cost much.  But I suppose rent at Caesar's Palace does.

If this review was based solely off Serendipity's FHC, they would be getting 5 stars from me, BUT, I tried their food...

Serendipity is a-typical of a restaurant in Vegas. Lots of flash, not much in delivery. The food, typical American-style sandwiches and the like, are o-k-a-y. Nothing to write home about, but good enough to satisfy your hunger. The prices are a little bit on the steep side ($15\/burger + fries).

If you're gonna come here, I would advise to find another place to eat first, AND THEN come just for the frozen hot chocolate. Yes, it's that good... I know a lot of people sit and wonder how hot chocolate can be put into a slushy, frozen form... Well, it can, and Serendipity has done it. It's like a packet of Swiss Miss blended into a perfect slushy state, with tons of whip cream and chocolate shavings. 

My friends & I ordered it, and as soon as it hit the table, we were quiet for a good five minutes as we all just sipped and sipped, until it was all gone.

Pros:
- Terrific waiter, really on top of things.  Nice guy, too.
- Location, right in front of Caesar's Palace

Cons:
- Food quality:  My hamburger sliders were severely undercooked, so much that I had to ask for the manager, and I have done that less than 5 times in 25 years.  To his credit he did not charge me for the sliders (they were a health hazard) and gave us a 20% discount for the poor kitchen performance. 
- Speed of the kitchen:  The restaurant was not terribly busy, yet still our order took more than 30 minutes to arrive.  
- Drink quality:  Mixed drinks were weak and expensive.  My wife had a $14 basic, frozen margarita and she couldn't taste the tequila.  I had a $10 basic bourbon & water, and it was weak, too.  
- Prices: You pay for convenient location on the strip, in front of Caesar's Palace.  A $14 house frozen margarita?  Come on.   

Overall:  
My whole family was deeply disappointed in this experience.  We paid $102 for a basic dinner for a family of five, and that includes no charge for the raw slider hamburgers, a 20% discount for the rest of the bill, and a 20% tip for the waiter for his terrific service.

Frozen Hot Chocolate is something your should definitely try if you this is your first time here. Its what everyone comes here for. It's essentially a hot chocolate frappacino. I really liked it the first time I tried it.

The frozen hot chocolate is not the only thing they serve, oh no, the actually have a very large menu of other delectable goodies. Our server, Karen mad cool and told us she had tried everything on the menu at least twice and here favorites were the 4 cheese mac & cheese with chicken and japalenos added and the crab cake salad. How could we not take the advice of someone that had tried the gigantic menu more than twice over? 

4 Cheese Mac & Cheese + chicken and Japalenos - WOW! Superbly well made Mac & Cheese, but adding the chicken and jalapenos, send it to another level. I dare say its one of the best Mac & Cheeses I have ever had and I get that dish almost everywhere I go.

Crab Cake Salad - Excellent hot crab cakes served of a mixed green salad. The heat from the crab cakes slightly wilts the greens and makes for a very pleasing blend of textures and temperatures.

Deep Fried Oreo Sundae - What! Deep Fried Oreos! In a Sundae! Yes please! I don't think I really have to say any more since these items by themselves would be pretty good. Put them together and you have a winner! Also, another recommendation from Karen. Haha, she is totally awesome! 

Since the menu has so much on it, its tough to say anything in general, but if you get what I got, I don't think you will be disappointed.",1,1,2

We came here this past Sunday night for their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate.  If you don't know what it is, it's just a Chocolate Milkshake....without the ice cream.  We waited in line for 10 minutes just to place our order.  Here's why...there was one girl taking orders....and the SAME girl making the drinks!  Now after placing our order, apparently, workers inside saw the huge line building up outside the ""take-out"" window, and one extra person decided to help out.  Funny, because through the pick-up window, we could hear him talking $hit about the girl (the one taking orders) with another co-worker!  After all this $hit talking, our drink was ready.  For $15 (for a double), this is EXTREMELY overpriced!!  And I do mean EXTREMELY!!!  I'm not 100% sure, but I'm pretty sure there isn't supposed to be ice chunks in it.  I was basically chewing my drink.  WTF??!?!

If you're looking for a frozen drink, I'd suggest going to Starbucks and getting a Frappacino....or better yet, go to Coffee Bean and get one of their blended drinks.  Granted, it will be more expensive than your local SB or CB, but it'll still be cheaper, faster, and more importantly, TASTIER!

Avoid this place!  If you really want to try one, I'd suggest stopping by one of their locations in NYC.",1,0,0

DO NOT go here if you are in a HURRY! DO NOT go here if you are HUNGOVER and need food ASAP!!!!

We went on the Sunday after Halloween, not many people were on the strip. It was about 11.  The wait was about 40 minutes, which I didn't think was too bad.

We were literally had a 2 1\/2 hour LUNCH!!!! Thank God we didn't have a plane to catch.  It took our server FOREVER to get us anything --water, diet coke, FOOD, dessert. We had to ask for the check when our entrees came because we were so nervous she would never come back to our table.  She (and all the other servers) kept disappearing to some room behind the bar and they seemed to never come out.

The food was good -- the nachos were amazing, obvi the frozen hot chocolate was good...sweet potato fries were amazing...but the service\/wait was AWFUL.

I will not be going back there (and I go to Vegas a lot). I was so excited that Serendipity came to LV, but so disappointed in the service. 

Also, it is EXTREMELY COLD if you sit inside...so bring a sweater (even if it is like 90 degrees outside).

Also, one more tip. If you go during brunch time make sure NOT to look at the menu they have posted on the building while you wait...ask the hostess for the brunch menu because that menu is MUCH more limited.

11pm and this place closes at midnight.  First of all, it's Vegas and why would a place like this, located literally right on the strip, smack dab in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd close at midnight?  That seems ridiculous, but we made it with plenty of time to spare. Apparently this place is a full service restaurant with a bar inside, and not just a dessert joint.  The hostess inside informed us that since we had a large party, that it would be quicker if we ordered from the window and sat outside.  Cool, that sounded easy enough.  So we perused the menu posted right outside, next to the window that you have to order from.  After a good 15 minute wait, we get to the window, and order...But wait!  Not all the items we wanted were available at the window. What?  The menu is right there!  Apparently, cakes are not available at the window.  So, the guy at the window told us all we had to do was go back inside and order at the bar.  Then take our food outside again.  Ok, here we go again.  

I order at the bar, and the bartender seemed a bit peeved that we were doing that, but lightened up at the end.  He was, after all, trying to serve the patrons at the bar too, and it seemed weird to order all this food at the bar.  Whatever.  What made things worse was that one of my friends wanted a big pretzel, and when I ordered it, the bartender told me that I had to order it OUTSIDE because it was only available at the window.  WTF!  The food all comes from the same kitchen, right?  So, I sent my friend outside and by this time, they were closing up the window, so they told her she couldn't order.  Oh HELL NO!  She wasn't having that, so she very sternly told them that she would be getting her pretzel and that they would be serving her.  And they did.

Enough of all that.  The ordering system could use some help.  That's obvious.

The desserts were all huge and were meant to be shared amongst 2 or more people.  Did we?  Hell no!  This is of course Vegas and we were living a life of excess...if only for one weekend. 

I'm happy to report that the carrot cake, all 12 inches plus of it, was delicious...according to my friends.  The humble pie, a peanut butter pie with graham cracker crust, was a bit too overwhelming in the peanut butter taste.  The same goes for the ""Can't say no"" Sundae...too much peanut butter and not enough everything else.  The pretzel was an epic fail!  Epic!  The frozen hot chocolate was a disappointment.  Perhaps if I didn't have it served ""to-go"" it would've had a better presentation, then a better taste.  For me, it was an overpriced Frappachino.

The best dessert in this place, hands down, was the deep fried oreo sundae.  It's huge, it's messy, and it's delicious.  Yes, that's still the sundae that I'm talking about.

The cakes and pie slices run about $7-$10 and can easily feed 2-3 people.  The sundaes are $15 and also feed 2-3.  If they could figure out a more efficient ordering system, they'd certainly have my business again...without the pretzel!

Should be more like 2 stars...but it's VEGAS BABY...VEGAS!",6,5,5

So was the wait worth it? Well, if an establishment is going to make people wait long, they better make it worth it!

THE FRRROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE
- ""Original and outrageously divine"" 
- Created around the 1950s
- For $12, you get one giant whipped cream, chocolate slushie.
- Oprah said ""I want to dance on the chandeliers!"" as she coined this as one of her favorite items in 2006. 
- First Lady, Jackie Kennedy tried to buy the recipe, and was denied it. 
- About 50 years later, the recipe became available on the internet
- If you even consider ""6 half-ounce pieces of a variety of YOUR favorite chocolates and 2 teaspoons of STORE BOUGHT hot chocolate mix"" a recipe.
- You might as well buy the pre-made mix; they sell those too.

Overall, I felt like I was enjoying a Starbucks frappuccino, minus the coffee. I don't think this place was meant for anything else but desserts. Food wasn't the greatest, but the dessert menu did look pretty good. Next time I will definitely try something else... like the Guinness World Record holder as the most expensive dessert, the Golden Opulence Sundae! If someone else pays of course. ;)

GOLDEN OPULENCE SUNDAE
- For a measly $1000
- Requires a 48 hour reservation advance so ingredients can be flown in from different parts of the world.
- Three to five scoops of rich Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream infused with Madagascar vanilla and covered in 23k edible gold leaf. 
- Chocolate syrup from melted Amedei Porcelana, one of the world's most expensive chocolates; and covered with chunks of rare Chuao chocolate, which is from cocoa beans harvested by the Caribbean Sea on Venezuela's coast.
- Exotic candied fruits from Paris, gold covered almonds\/dragets, chocolate truffles and marzipan cherries.
- Tiny glass bowl of Grand Passion Caviar. It's sweetened and infused with fresh passion fruit, orange and Armagnac.
- Edible gold leaf is made from pure gold that is compressed or rolled into very thin sheets that are only a few micrometers thick and contain no other metals or impurities.
- Topped off with a gilded sugar flower and sprinkled with small flakes of more edible gold.
- All presented in a complimentary Baccarat crystal goblet, and enjoyed with an 18-carat gold spoon.",2,0,0

Located by the Caesars Palace Forum Shops facing the strip is this cute Sin City version of the NYC cafe.  I've had the luxury of trying the original location in NYC and I'm sad to say that I prefer the food and drinks here.

There were 4 of us and we each ordered something different.  Mushroom burger, some sort of hot dog, chicken burger, and buffalo wings and we were all pretty content with the quality.  Nothing too spectacular, but not too shabby either.  Personally, I probably wouldn't eat here all the time since Vegas has so many options, but this place is a must try for one thing.

What stole our hearts that visit were the double frozen hot chocolates.  Me and my gf refused to share one of those ginormous, heaping chocolate milkshake-ish desserts because we are greedy lil heffers so we each got our own.  The guys got the regular frozen hot chocolate and that did not compare.  You have to get the double because they add icecream and the texture is so rich and much creamier.   Thinking back, it probably would've been a better idea to share, especially after the big meal.  It felt like a never ending fountain of chocolate goodness and by the time we were halfway done, we felt so sick from all that sugar and brain freeze.  But we were all smiles regardless!!

~$14 for the regular frozen hot chocolate and I think we paid ~$22 for the double.  A bit steep, but when you're in Vegas, you gotta live life in the fast lane!",1,1,1

The hostess was sort of rude, and acted like she was doing us a favor by taking our name.  

Once we were seated, we ordered the famous frozen hot chocolate (the ""for 2"" size), which was ok but nothing amazing... it tasted a bit like a thin milkshake made with  pre-made powdered hot chocolate mix (which, in retrospect, is probably exactly what it was).  I ordered the French toast with berries, bacon and egg.  The French toast was burnt, but everything else was good.  The berries were fresh, the bacon was almost strangely good, the breakfast potatoes were a little oily but had a good flavor, and the egg was fine.  My husband ordered the blueberry pancakes, which were good.  Both portions were absolutely enormous, and we wished that we had shared a dish rather than getting two.  

The service was adequate, but not good.  The waitress was efficient, but did not engage or interact with us at all.",0,0,0

Especially the peanut butter flavor....with the bits of reeses peanut butter cups at the bottom....omgggg soooooo delicious! It IS over-priced but I would still get it cuz I love it that much =P

This time I came here, there was a huge wait. But we actually ended up getting a table within 15min since I think a lot of people leave cuz they didn't want to wait too long. My two girl friends and I shared their famous hot dog that the waitress kept raving about being the best hot dog ever, but honestly...it's not very special at all. It tasted like any normal hot dog, just a lot....longer. Nothing special, just something you have to try once but I probably wouldn't order it again. We also got the crab cake salad which was pretty yummy. The salad portion is actually not too big, but their sandwiches and hot dogs are humongous. Definitely good for sharing.

The restaurant itself is adorable, really colorful, girly, pink and just plain cute. 

As far as the service, we got our food in a reasonable amount of time, given that they were really busy. Our server was really nice and cheerful; I appreciate that because the last thing you want is a grumpy server. With the reception though, there were issues with one of the hostesses (err she ticked me off) but I won't go into that because she later apologized.

I ordered the three cheese grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup. This has got to be one of the cutest presentations I've seen in a while because it had goldfish crackers in the soup. SO ADORABLE! Even with three layers of bread, I still could taste mostly cheese which was really yummy. I kind of wish there was a little less brie because there was a little too much of it. The soup was good too, not the best I've ever had but not the worst, that's for sure. 

Okay... here we go... I think I read one too many reviews of  the Frrozen Hot Chocolate. Everyone (not just Yelpers but everyone period) has hyped it up to the point where I expected it would taste like how D'Angelo looked in the ""How Does it Feel"" music video... just good all over. (Nice visual, right? LOL) I wish nobody told me anything because I would've liked it a lot more. Honestly, in my opinion, it was a chocolate milkshake with halo-halo* ice mixed in with a bunch of whipped cream on it.  Good but not good enough for me to pay $10 again, which I really didn't because my friends and I split it because it was huge.

To sum it up, the drink is an iced chocolatey drink. It's pretty decent although if you're really into it, there's an exact knock off of this recipe listed on food network. Google it. You're welcome. 

The whipped cream on top was delicious, almost my favorite part of the drink. It's about a 1:1 ratio iced chocolate drink to cream. Before we dove in, my friend mentioned she should have asked them for no whipped cream. Excuse me? Who are you? 

The chocolate chips that topped off the drink were not good at all. The worst I've ever tried but the rest of the drink made up for it.

If you have a sweet tooth though, this should be a definite stop on your list. I had the toasty s'mores milkshake and it was pretty incredible. I had it twice, and somehow, the first one was better and had more of a marshmallow taste than the second one. I'm guessing this is because the marshmallows on the second one were a bit burnt. My friend had the oreo milkshake and said it was great but very rich and a strawberry milkshake which he said was fantastic. My coworker had the fried twinkie sundae which he compared to a funnel cake with ice cream and caramel on it. He said on a scale from 1-10, he would give it an 8.5---coming from a very picky eater, that's pretty great! I did have to ask for milkshake straws and napkins, which is why I took a star off. Overall, a great little dessert place. We will definitely be going back for more sweets the next time we come across Serendipity 3!",1,0,1

First of all, $11 for the ""frozen hot chocolate""?? This can't be the same treat that the whole world raves about.  It was too icy, WAY too sweet, and tasted like a concoction I could whip up at home with some instant nestle powder.  I was not alone on this boat, many of my fellow diners agreed with me.  Even my friend from New York who regularly frequents the original manhattan serendipity- she thought the one served here was of inferior quality.  If you must order one of these tourist trap treats, I suggest the Amaretto flavor- much better tasting than the regular one.  

Breakfast did not fare much better.  I wanted to order the egg white shrimp frittata-  but the waitress told me they ran out (really? at 10:30am??)  Instead, I ordered the fried eggs benedict (Corn Meal Crusted Fried Poached Eggs, Classic Hollandaise & Canadian Bacon atop Sausage Gravy & House Made Biscuit). When the dish arrived, it certainly looked pretty enough!  But alas, it did not taste as good as it looked.  I hoped that despite the egg being fried, the yolk would still be relatively runny.  My hopes were quickly dashed. The lack of creamy yolkiness took all the fun away from eating an eggs benedict :( The hollandaise sauce was too sparse and the biscuit was too dry and tough to cut- not flaky at all.  All in all, probably the worst eggs benedict I've had.  

The other girls ordered the staple brunch dishes (french toast, chicken&waffles, omelet).  Portions were massive and it made for great photo-ops.  But in the end, nobody raved about their food, and we took back ~70% of it in doggie bags.  On a brighter note, our leftovers were put to good use later that evening as a drunken midnight snack.  I guess beer-goggles can apply to tastebuds as well!",4,1,2

I have always wanted to try Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.  Serendipity has a takeout booth where you can get many drinks and such to go or a sit-down restaurant where you can get a full menu of food options as well as the frozen hot chocolate in a much nicer presentation.  I opted for the takeout booth.

The frozen hot chocolate is a good portion size and features a frozen chocolate concoction, which is similar to a milkshake though it really is an iced chocolate drink.  The chocolate drink is good.  It is cool and refreshing and has a good chocolate flavor.  I wouldn't say that it is any more memorable than any other good frozen chocolate drink out there, but it is satisfying enough.

They top the drink off with whipped cream and the whipped cream is good.  It is a little thicker than a lot of whipped creams out there and it has a pretty good vanilla flavor.

Service was quick on my one visit.

Prices were high--probably too high (maybe even too high for Las Vegas).  The frozen hot chocolate runs $11.  I think outside of Vegas, a drink like this one would most likely go for $6 and would probably not exceed $8.

Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate is a good but not special drink even though you are definitely paying a special, premium price.  I think it is good for at least one try, but I think the flavor does not really stand out that much.  There is a Vosges boutique in the Forum Shops and that chocolates boutiques used to serve milkshakes--they were far better in terms of flavor and even a little cheaper than Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.

Now that Vosges no longer offers those milkshakes, I'm not sure where you can find a great frozen chocolate drink in Vegas, but a less expensive Haagen-Dazs milkshake would probably provide just as satisfying flavor and experience as what you can have at Serendipity (with the exception of the whipped cream).

I only tried one thing on the menu so this review will be a short one.  I had the much talked about Frozen Hot Chocolate.  It was decent, the serving size was overkill, and it was a truly decadent and rich treat.  It was just a little too sweet and powdery for my liking and I think it had more whipped cream than actual frozen hot chocolate.  I think I would much rather spend my money inside Caesar's Palace at a delicious dessert shop with the best macarons ever.  For a frozen hot chocolate though, I think I'll stick with San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square.

This ice cream shop is sickeningly cute.  Like every other place on The Strip, the theme is rampant and the atmosphere is worth a few selfies for Instagram.  Stop by if you're an ice cream fanatic.  I hope you don't mind the wait and the obvious tourist trap that makes up Serendipity.",10,6,10

I noticed other guests were signaling for her attention and she seemed to have a very good awareness of her area and appeared to notice the polite hand waving in her periphery without losing connection with us.  Once she was done with us, she moved on to the neighboring guests, flashed her award winning great smile and they were putty in her hands.  Actually, she had me at ""Hello"".

The food arrives!!!  First my Boss's Ruben arrives.  I love a good Ruben and when I saw his, I thought I should have ordered one, but didn't want to make anyone uncomfortable.  You know what I mean...next, my Las Vegas Strip Sandwich arrives and WHOA MAN, I am so glad I didn't get the Ruben now...next visit.   This is a hefty piece of carnivores delight.   If I were at home I would have thrown it on a plate, plop down on the couch, put on some football and gone to town, but being in coat and tie and in public that whole egg yolk dribbling down the chin would not fly so I did the right thing and cut it into thirds.  About a pound each I swear to goodness.  I took the first bite...how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways...It was almost as good a lingering first kiss.  Hot, salty, crunchy, savory, smoky, my ...WAIT! BACK THE TRUCK UP!!!!...that is not a good example of a great lingering first kiss, but just work with me.  The synchronization of flavors, textures, body responses, was almost overwhelming.  Yes, I was totally satisfied.  

Please note that this sandwich is not for the faint of heart.  You need to get your grub on to finish it but alas, that how I roll.  It's just one of those things you want to continue masticating until it's no more no matter how full the hypothalamus screams. 

Bon appetite!",1,3,3

My party of 5 got sat in a little over 30 min. We have been sitting for 10 min with absolutely no service. We asked the hostess to get someone to get to our table and it has been more than 5 min. I guess when they have a request like that they laugh about it with each other and do nothing about it. Today is Sunday...I can't imagine this place on a Friday\/Saturday. This restaurant is pretty small with a lot of hostesses and waiter\/waitresses but someone everyone fails to get it together.

Finally, we got to order. They are ""back ordered"" on the white chocolate and strawberry frozen hot chocolates. Fantastic. You'd think that the kitchen would be stocked with the large amounts of people that come in for the infamous frozen hot chocolates. We ordered a classic sundae,  original frozen hot chocolate, a mint frozen hot chocolate and an oreo frozen hot chocolate. Our Oreo one didn't come out and we were already finished with the rest so I flagged down our waitress who gave me so much attitude because she forgot to put in the order. Also, we did not get our change back. Guess that was tip. 

This place is literally on the strip. Great location and a good amount of people but horrible service. If you have a couple hours to waste, come here. The only reason why we came to this place was to bring our friends from Cali and to try the frozen hot chocolate...which was okay. Probably would have enjoyed it better if the service was better?

We showed up at lunch time and we were lucky since everyone would prefer to sit inside we were seated immediately outside facing the strip.

The decor is very bright and ""carnival like?"".  Think of an old school soda shop with very bright pink and orange seats.  The seats were comfortable and the environment was very fun.

Before we could even snuggle into our seats, our server was there with a big smile on his face and a welcoming attitude.  He took our drink orders with enthusiasm and not long afterwards they were in front of us.  The menu is expansive and has so many different food options.  We did not know the history of this restaurant and just ordered what sounded good to us.

We ordered an Asian Chicken Salad to start with.  They had it split for us in the kitchen without us even asking for that.  The two halves came beautifully plated and tasted even better in our mouth.  The chicken was moist (dry chick pet peeve of mine), flavorful and the salad and dressing delicious.  Even though we shared a salad, we could have been satisfied with that half.  But being us and the need to try other flavors we also ordered entrees.  I was smart and ordered an appetizer as my meal, the Wagyu Beef Sliders.  I made one adjustment and replaced the American cheese with Blue Cheese.  They were delicious, juicy and again too much for me to finish.  Hubby ordered the The One & Only Las Vegas Strip Steak Sandwich.  His plate came out and I couldn't stop laughing.  We needed 3 people just to eat that sandwich.  It was FULL with steak, eggs and just mouth watering ingredients.  As predicted he couldn't finish it, but he wants to go back and not have any starters so he can really make a dent in this sandwich.

We did not have any room for desserts, so we will have to go back and give them another go just for sweets.  

***Here's a trick for all of you.  If you want to sit on the Strip side and do not mind sitting at a bar.  Go directly to the back bar and take a seat.  It's first come first serve and you do not have to wait to be seated.  They have the same menu and the bartenders and awesome",1,0,1

The only down side is that ordering to go means smaller portion but it's still worth it and I should probably prevent myself from striking diabetus this early on. A little downside is the last time I ordered a frozen hot chocolate, it was a little too chalky to taste. There are a handful of flavors to choose from but I always stick with the original!!

Went there with a friend for dinner and dessert. Had a chicken salad and felt horribly sick afterwards. Gave them a second chance and had a burger...no bueno.

As for the frozen hot chocolate I will admit at first I thought, ""What's all the hype around this dessert?"" I took a couple sips and thought, ""that's it?!"" Kind of disappointed at first, however I found my self not being able to stop sipping on it. And I should reveal I am not a fan of hot chocolate. It's a yummy rich and chocolately treat. They also have other frozen treats with liquor in them for the adults ;) Have yet to try those so I'll report back.

Decore is fun and the location is perfect...right on Las Vegas Blvd. If you sit on the patio you are literally dinning with the traffic.

Food: damn delicious. i cant really say that you get your moneys worth because some items on the menu aren't really money's worth in quantity but in quality i can absolutely say yes. the reason being so is because i went with my dad and sister. i ordered the ribs expecting a full rack of ribs but nope all that was given were three, and ill repeat three, beef rib bones. they were meaty. enough to keep you on a single bone for a couple of minutes. small fries and a small slaw was given as well. i can say that i was somewhat full. so that made up for it. my dad ordered the forgot the name but it was a steak sandwich. the steak was absolutely perfect. it also had 3 sunny side eggs and a strips of bacon. oh and i was on two half loaves of french baguette. so that's pretty darn huge. it was good but after a while you kind of get tired of chewing. my sister ordered an appetizer because she wasn't that hungry. she got the wings. they give you 10 pieces of hot wings. the dipping sauce was bleu cheese but she swapped it for ranch. im not a fan of spicy food but i tried it anyways. i know this place makes their food fresh in all but honestly it felt like i was eating hot wings from Costco. so nothing special. After that we tried their all famous frrrozen hot chocolate for two. for the price of 15 it was well worth it. just imagine hot chocolate but in a mocha form. all  of their frrrozen hot chocolates cost the same. they have a variety of different kinds so we got the white chocolate one. it was damn good. the next time i come here im trying something different.

service: is damn excellent. i mean every time i would ask for something such as more water or a knife or something i would always get the ""right away boss"" ""here you go boss"" its nice to hear that but i gotta give it to them because not every restaurant does that. Our waiter was nice. cleaned our tables. picked up our empty plates. etc... there were times when the place would be crowded so they would forget  what i asked for but its understandable.

Location: this is vegas by the way so i can really say anything about where its placed. i mean shoot lucky we stayed at ceasers cause i gotta say parking was a bitch. i mean pedestrians not caring about traffic walk signs is one thing but having everyone turn into the same place is hell enough. as i stated, luckily we stayed at Caesar's palace. we just walked over .

Side note: we were seated rather quickly, but this is random cause there are times when there are a couple of tables open and there are times when every table is occupied.

They were spot on with their raves. It wasn't your usual ""shake"" or  ""malted"". My little friend and I got the double so we could share. Good idea, we didn't even drink\/eat it all. 

Although I didn't order the brownie sundae and neither did anyone in my party, I did taste it. Phenomenal! You're wondering how I accomplished this huh? Well, I look over at the table next to us and see a guy with this monstrous sundae in front of him. I lean over with my fork like I'm going to steal a bite, mischevious look and all. To my surprise, my new friend holds out the untouched sundae and invites me to help myself. Mama didn't raise no dummy, I took a big bite and ate it with my eyes closed so I could taste every component. I need to share that with someone next time.

As far as the food. Meh. I think I'll stick to desserts. Not that the food wasn't good, it just wasn't anything spectacular for the price. I had the asparagus omelet which was good but nothing to write home about. That's OK, they can focus their attention on their desserts. Fine by me.",0,0,0

It was soooo bland and literally had 3 pieces of DICED chicken. Take in mind your paying $5 more, you should be given more than 3 pieces of cubes. Anyways, food is mediocre.

The service is fairly lousy.  But, I am guessing that they are constantly beyond busy, that something has to suffer a bit....and it's certainly not the food.  We did have to wait the two times we vistied Serendipity3 during our stay.  The girls taking your name down act more like bouncers than friendly hostesses.  They are not friendly or nice at all.  Both times we went they treated us poorly.  The first time, we had just gotten married and I was in a wedding dress.  Still, not so much as a congratulation....they looked at us and rolled their eyes.  So, they girls at the front are not sweet, nice or friendly. 
Once you get passed all that and are actually allowed to sit in this confectionary heaven, you will quickly forget the teeny bopper hostesses and dream about your order.  
I ordered a blueberry mojito, which was beyond delicious.  I will seriously dream about that drink....not too sweet....very fresh, with muddled mint and fresh blueberries throughout.  
We ordered the buffalo chicken wings.......also fantastic.  Not too hot, just a good amount of spice...and fried first, so they are a little crispy.  Perfect! 
We had the Summer sandwich, with the pumpernickel raisen bread, cranberry mayo, turkey breast, apple slices, melted brie and topped with sprouts......sooooooooooooooooooooo yummy!   
For dessert, we had the chocolate cake...which I think was called forbidden chocolate cake sundae.  Gorgeous chocolate cake with a ganache frosting, vanilla and chocolate icecream, miles of homemade whip cream, chocolate shavings and a cherry on top.  It was huge, incredible, not too sweet, but ulta indulgent.  Just pure dessert heaven. 
We also ordered a frozen hot chocolate.  We had to try it.  It was very good........again, not too sweet.  It sort of tasted like a hot chocolate slurpee with whip cream.   It doesn't taste like a chocolate slurpee, but more like swiss miss frozen.........That doesn't really do it justice, but the flavor is unique and quite scrumptious!

The service was nice and friendly. I'm sure it might be a little frustrating for the hosts to have to tell people to wait for such a long time. No problem for us. We waited at the bar next door and killed some time by consuming some beverages. 

The host was also very polite. They seated my bf right next to a sunny window and it was about 110 degrees out. She tried to help him out by taking down the shade and making him more cozy. 


We ordered a steak sandwhich with eggs and one of their chili dogs. The food was good but not the best. However, I couldn't complain. My bf said the orea shake was a perfect treat. He is a huge icecream buff so I really wanted him to try it.

Their quintessential ""frrrrrrrozen hot chocolate"" tastes like something I can duplicate by making Swiss Cocoa Mix, freezing it, then putting it through my Ninja blender and viola!  I got frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrozen hot chocolate for about 25 cents!

I also got the deep fried oreo with cookies n cream ice cream.  While it sounds delicious and the deep fried oreos were as expected, who thinks of deeply inserting their oily, hot deep friend oreos into ice cream??  There's a temperature difference going on here, who do you think will win?  Yep, the hot ass oreos!  So there I am eating my deep fried oreos and ""drinking"" my ice cream.

Our waitress was super friendly and accommodating.

The onion ring appetizer was fancy and delicious.  My brie\/turkey sandwich was alright, i'd get something else next time, but the true stars were the fries!

Okay if I was a vegas local maybe I'd dock star because it's like $10 a pop. However since I'm only in Vegas a couple times a year...HECK YAH I'm gonna pay $10 for it and it's worth it. Service was great and our servers were super chill. Decor was cute.

I also love that you don't have to wait the 3+ hours like you do in for the original one if  NYC (at least for now when everyone doesn't really know about it). If you're not in a rush I recommend to wait to get seated inside because it's nice and cool with AC. This weekend our group of 8 girls were in a rush so we opted for the quick wait before be seated at the outside patio. Outside they have misters and fans blowing trying to keep everyone cool in the 100+ degree weather. Wish I we ate inside because our dessert melted super fast...but maybe next time. For those on the run they have a 'TO GO' window too. Alright!

Woohoo...all I have to do is take a 1 hour to fly to Vegas and I'm good. Now if only they'd open one up in the Bay Area.

It's located outside Caesars Palace, on the walkway towards The Bellagio. Pro tip: If you want to sit inside, you need to order a full-on meal. However, they do offer the option of ordering at the to-go window if you're fine with enjoying your dessert al fresco!

Frozen Hot Chocolate [$10]

Over the years, I've been dulled to all that is the frozen hot chocolate. Overrated and overpriced in my opinion, this features chilled ""hot"" chocolate. You can essentially taste the texture from the crystallized sugar from the hot chocolate packet mix, with a huge dollop of whipped cream on top.

Red Velvet Sundae [$12 \/ $10 Total Rewards]

If you have your Caesars Palace Total Rewards card, there are quite a few offerings that offer bargain prices. The red velvet sundae offers rich red velvet cake with a great cream cheese frosting, paired with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge.

Deep Fried Oreos & Ice Cream [$12 \/ $10 Total Rewards] 

If you're looking for a gut bomb, check out the deep fried oreos, which had a crisp surrounding batter, revealing gooey Oreos within. The vanilla ice cream was a nice cooling base for each bite.

Maybe I got the brand names wrong, but the flavor profile is similar to that of supermarket ingredients. Sigh.

It's a bit more touristy than some other locales since it is one of the family\/kid friendly spots. Avoid prime eating times to get the shortest wait. It's a bit unavoidable during the summer but you can call ahead for a reservation or just pick up something to go and enjoy the AC inside. Their to-go menu offers most of the items on the regular menu! and for those complaining..you're in Vegas, you should be prepared to spend anyhow.

The decor of this place is a bit vintage with some really cute touches like the giant sundae by the stairs and the Tiffany's lamps. If it's a really hot day, try to get indoor seating... which will probably bump up your wait. The patio has the water misters and is ventilated but you'll still feel the summer heat. 

Service isn't bad. They get their food out in a reasonable time but at times it can be hard to get a hold of your server. If you get thirsty while waiting for your table, head over to the bar counter inside and you can get tall cups of ice water.

The food is in good sized portions, so you're not overpaying too much; its like any designer item, there's a cost for that label. I've tried a bunch of things on the menu but here are some that I can remember well... Kobe Sliders are delicious if you're looking to get something on the smaller side. The foot long hotdog comes with alot of condiments and you can add toppings. The Mac n Cheese was really good. Try the Ahi Salad and the Hangover Omelette! 

Order the Frozen Hot Chocolate. it's probably what you came here for. Don't gripe about the cost because you shouldn't be in Vegas if you're not willing to spend some money. If you don't like it, at least you can say you've tried it. Personally it's a must order when I come. Why? It's different. Some of my friends have pointed out it kinda tastes like Hershey's chocolate but it's a nice alternative to soda and alcohol.

It came with black beans,  crusty old looking ground beef that must have been sitting somewhere for hours and cheese. The small amount of meat on the nachos had that dark crusted over color on the top and we should have known from that point on but they were $14 so we ate about 1\/3 of the order. We both ordered the up the skirt steak, it was pretty good but again we both ended up with food poisoning -though I can't say if it was the steak or the nachos that got us. I tried the green tea frozen drink and it was way too sweet for me but they were kind and switched it out for me.  Our server was nice, he was really busy so another guy (mgr?) took our order for us and brought us water which was nice.

There is more than a smattering of reviews on this page about the alleged terrible service here.

Zero wait.  And...impeccable service.

On my last visit, I ordered the deep fried Oreo sundae.  Different than your average carnival food, the deep fried Oreos concocted are showered in crispy cornflakes.  Certainly a welcome change in texture from the oiled globs of dough that usually adorn these cookies. Perfect all around to satiate your sweet tooth.  They offer numerous items ranging from savory to the decadently sweet.  My advice is to stick with the sweet stuff.

After waiting nearly an hour to get our food after we placed our order, our food came out. I would have been willing to give this place 2 or 3 stars if the food was at least half decent, but it wasn't. Our burgers were extremely dry, the chicken satay wraps were tasteless and cold, and my sister's fries were dry and stale. I was hoping that after the long wait, at least our food would be good, but it seemed like it had just been sitting out forever. 

Frozen Hot Chocolate: 
My best advice would be to skip their frozen hot chocolate and instead, go to Godiva and get their frozen Dark Chocolate Decadence shake. It tastes better and costs less than half the price. We got the frozen hot chocolate to go because we wanted to get out of the place. The frozen hot chocolate is good, but definitely not worth $11. Each of us took a few sips and that was all we needed before throwing it away. And trust me, it was not because we were full. 

This was the closest I have ever come to walking out of a restaurant. Our server, Robert or something like that, was probably one of the worst servers I have ever had. My entire family works or has worked in the restaurant\/service industry so we usually give servers the benefit of the doubt, but this guy was unacceptable even to our standards. He gave us a bunch of attitude and was not attentive at all. At one point, it was taking so long for our food to come out that my mom asked him to cancel our order. But he told us, ""Oh, but it's right there, I can see it"". I had a direct view of the kitchen and there was nothing on the counter... but we decided to be nice and say ok. Fast forward 15 minutes later... still no food. He intentionally avoided our table during that entire time and was not apologetic at all. I think he may have said sorry once but it was the least genuine and most condescending ""sorry"" I have ever heard.

We were excited to take family there to experience the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. Indoors was a 30-45 min wait, with an emphasis on minimum of 30 min so we opted for the front patio area. We asked if they could turn on the heat lamps but they were completely out of propane per the hostess and manager. Ok. We endured the slight chill. If we asked if we could also put our name in for a table indoors, the hostess told us in a very condescending tone that if we wanted indoors, then we had to get out of our seats and wait in the waiting area.... And that we had to make up our minds as there was another party that could use our seats. Lovely. So we stayed outside. Five minutes later we see them light up the heat lamp that was next to the hostess and by the other large party.  Propane shortage over? No, just for them. Fantastic. Anyway so our party of 8 ordered and still enjoyed our time together. The food took over 20-30 min. The desserts came out first. By the end of our meal, we left a standard tip and went back to gambling. The next day as i was thinking about how much I paid, I realized that the total and subtotal has a $40 difference and tax isn't THAT much. They automatically added the gratuity. Ugh. While I realize this is somewhat standard, I wish the waitress would have been nice enough to remind\/inform us. If the management says ""well it's written on the menu"", have you seen the size of their giant menu packed with choices and illustrations and tidbits??? Suffice to say, we clearly did not intend to give her  such a nice tip. Hope she and the staff there pay it forward.

I dreamed about having frozen hot chocolate since I learned about the original Serendipity in NYC from I think a Babysitters Club Book back in the day. The $1k gold sundae is on every desserts show on those food channels.

Went with husband for late night eats and sweets. He got spaghetti and meatballs, I got a tomato salad. (Strange sounding to eat late night but the craving hit and we were going to meet up with people nearby later so it was convenient.)

The spaghetti, al dente yes but the sauce not flavorful. Needed more. The meatballs were tender. 

The tomato salad....heirloom tomatoes or not, looked like 5 enormous chopped up tomatoes, blobbed with wet, sloppy buratta. (Well the menu DID warn me it was ""wet burrata"". Sea salt sprinkled on some pieces...others featured brown, shriveled basil strips. Dressing was nice. The first three bites was good...but the gloppy mess made me I'll just looking at it. 

The somewhat indifferent server  came to pick up our plates and even cried out ""what happened??"" pointing to our still 75% not eaten dishes.

I got a groupon that included two salads, two burgers, and a frozzen hot chocolate to share. Got offered water while we waited for the waitress which took about ten minutes. When she came we ordered the burgers with the salad. The salads sit on the side of the hot plate ready to grab and go. We sat for thirty minutes waiting for the salads. We got our burgers from the food runner when she stopped and asked if we had gotten our salads. So she brought mine and replaced my guys with an extra order of sweet potato fires on the house since he didn't want the salad since the burger was right there. As soon as se got the fries (two minutes) she asked to take my salad away. I just let her since it seemed like it was a big deal for me to eat that and my fries. I looked at my burger and noticed they forgot my avocado I orders on the cheese burger. Had to stop the food runner to get it. While we were half way threw the fries the waitress came back and asked if we were ready to have her put in dessert. we agrees. She came fast with the dessert and check and requested to take the fries. Since I had the groupon I only had to pay for the extra things like drinks and add on to the burger. Free refills but the soda is five bucks. I put my card in and had the check standing up while we eat dessert since I only had a ten and felt bad if I only gave a two dollar tip. even though my guy thinks any tip was to much since he has worked in the past as a dish runner to head waiter in high school to college.But no one came to get the card and the place at this point was basically empty since it was almost two and lunch rush was over.

When we finally got it after waiting 45 mins from the time we were seated, it was nothing special.  I think McDonald's fraps are better. 

1. The server took a good 10-15 mins to take our order.

2. By the time we got it it was melting and a substantial puddle of melted cream and water formed on the bottom of the plate it comes on (probably because it was sitting for 10-15 mins.)

3. It was our first time here so I didn't know if chunks of ice, literally cubes, we're suppose to be in there. There was so many big chunks of ice I couldn't drink it with a straw.
    The irritating thing is when I told the server that it was our first time here and I was wondering if chunks of ice were suppose to be in the frozen hot chocolate.
He said yes, because it is a frozen drink.

Then, they throw it in a blender with two scoops of Ben and Jerry's chocolate ice cream. Pour it into a glass and add whipped cream\/chocolate shavings. Done. 

It's actually very tasty and the portions are generous. My sister and I shared a small, and we could barely finish it. Beware that it is very messy to eat\/drink.

For dinner I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad with homemade Garlic Parmesan Croutons that cost almost close to $20 (but it was a huge mixing  bowl portion) While the size might have given you your money's worth, the fish was too fishy and half cooked, the lettuce was drowning in a mayonnaise based Caesar dressing so It was soggy.

After my not-so-appetizing dinner, i was sort of looking forward to a dessert called the Frozen Hot Chocolate, but didn't get the chance to because they ran out of ingredients, so they suggested the hot chocolate sundae. What? isn't it chocolate and ice that you need to make this dessert? Ugh So we opted for the Strawberry Fields Sundae, cheesecake, strawberry ice cream, strawberry topping with whipped cream all for $15.00!!! SERIOUSLY? There was two scoops of ice cream on the bottom of a goblet topped with strawberry compote and LOADS of whip cream. Really is that necessary? 

In the end, I made a note to myself that I will never come here again, nor will I suggest this place to anybody. Chili's or Apple-bees in my opinion makes better quality foods at a decent-not-so-overrated price! 

Never again.",2,1,0

Second time: appetizers, drinks, and dessert. Macaroni and cheese, artichoke dip, and WAFFLE FRIES. These were all good, but nothing extraordinary... Drinks: peanut butter frozen hot chocolate (again, peanut butter mixed with dessert isn't my fave) and a Pina Colada because they were out of some root-beer drink that is supposed to be tasty.

In all seriousness, places that have the reputation of being a cute, girly, dessert oriented place don't make it high on my priority list and I usually need someone of the female persuasion to convince me to go.  But when my friend and his GF suggested we meet up there for lunch, I thought, 'sure why not' after hearing their food menu is actually quite good.

So cut to a sunny Sat afternoon in front to Caesars Palace and we had to wait about 30 min for our table to open up, chilling (literally) in the mist enhanced sunshade tent which was a nice service to offer.  For those who didn't want to wait for a table there is an outdoor 'to go' window althought I suspect some of them had to wait almost as long for their food, and by that time their frozen hot chocolates were probably halfway melted (more on that later).

What can I say, aside from the glaringly obvious presence of a fully lit LA style martini bar in the corner of the dining area (for the men who are desperately trying to salvage the last shreds of their masculinity) with sports on the plasma tvs, the decor is as cute and pink as one would expect.  And the dining crowd by my visual estimate was at least 70-80% female, complete with GFs, wives, kids, grandmas, all in all and very kid friendly place.

All 3 of us decided to go for their brunch menu items, altho the burgers and other non breakfast items looked equally mouth watering, but I wanted to save my stomach for another burger place.  I opted for the Hangover's Omelette which was a light and fluffy yet massive mega-omelette complete with cheese, sausage, bacon and french fries INSIDE the egg wrap.  Other items on the table included eggs benedict which I thought was quite good and the monster sized 'french toast log' complete with breakfast potatos, ice cream, fruit and bacon on the side.  The log was big enough to feed all of us, to be honest.

Now the frozen hot chocolate, yes I've heard all about it and no, I never paid attn to the yelp photos.  I was expecting something the size of a Starbucks frappucino but my god this was huge.  They come in 2 sizes and while my friends got the classic hot choc, I wanted to try the white chocolate version to change things up.  Coming in 2 sizes I wisely chose the 'one man' size and when I got it....it looked no smaller than the portion for 2, and while normally I wouldn't complain about getting more for my money, this was too much for me and I couldnt even finish what I took to go.  Honestly, there should be a 'baby bear' size to go with the momma and poppa bear sizes.  I know I'm in the minority in this, but that's ok.

For those who try to get into the famed flagship NY store with their supposed 3 hr waits, you honestly might save a little time flying into vegas hop over to the Vegas one and fly back.  No i'm not serious but if you happen to be in LV, definitely try it out.",1,1,2

We came for  lunch around 2pm and we had to wait around 20 min for a table.  It was a Saturday, so we knew there was going to be a lot of people there.

The decor of the place is very ""girly"" as my husband described it.  Lots of pinks\/oranges.  

My hubby had the Cali footlong hot dog and I had the High Heel Pump Sandwich.  Our food was pretty good and the portions were huge.  Our food came sweet potato fries and honey japaleno chips.

Of course we also had the famous frozen hot chocolate!  YUM!   Tons of whip cream on top, chocolate shavings, and just nice and cold for the 86 degree weather.

The food tasted great, mostly probably because we were starving, but we were not disappointed.  

The service, however, was S-L-O-W!! After we got our food, we had to flag down our server for a refill on drinks and it took forever to get our check.  Not only that, but it also took forever to have them pick up our check.

Both times met with a super annoyed hostess who took pride in telling us it was a 45 minute wait (we were a party of 2!) and probably preferred us to leave.  The first night we couldn't wait because we had a show to catch, but decided to try again the next night.  FYI this was on a Monday and Tuesday night--so I cant' even imagine their annoyance or the wait time on a weekend.

We expected a 45 minute wait to be worth it, given its popularity.  We only went for dessert.  Tho the menu lists several teas, they only had Earl Grey, so we opted for water. 

$15 for the Lookie Lookie Gimme Cookie Sundae.  For $15 you get: the cheapest, most disgusting cookie dough ice cream, a drizzle of hershey's syrup (or similar) a tuft of canned whipped cream, and over-baked, rock-hard cookies.   My daughter didn't even want to eat the ice cream after 2 bites. 

The manager agreed with how bad the sundae was and comped us for it.

 So basically we waited 45 minutes to tip the server $5 for bringing us water.   At least it was cold.

We ate a lot. So prepare yourself for a comprehensive review. ;)

Went to Vegas this past weekend with friends and had the chance to visit Serendipity's on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  We caught the restaurant during the soft opening, and had a great experience!

If you are walking off the strip along LV Boulevard and up the stairs into the restaurant you are greeted by a host podium in the shape of a woman's bust! They weren't swamped, so you leave your name with the host in the merchandise corner inside the restaurant and get a buzzer.

The Vegas location indoors is expansive compared to the NY location, with patio seating wrapping around the restaurant, as well as a To-Go window.  (More space here meant no stranger's elbow in your side or waiter's tray nicking you in the head here!!!) Unlike NY, the only doo-dads and randoms the LV location sells are Serendipity-branded merchandise, as well as a few sweets.  

The staff manages to utilize small space well, as seen in the bar and the open kitchen.  The bar is colorful and entertaining, with wispy cotton candy filling glass jars for the signature Cotton Candy martinis, and their ever-so popular Frrrozen Hot Chocolates lining up on the counters ready to be served. 

Our wait was 20-30 minutes, during which my friends ordered a couple drinks, two of which names I can't remember, but they were yummy. While they worked on their buzz we hung out in the large courtyard outside overlooking fountains and (at least for this particular weekend) a Thai shrine.

Our waiter was Allen, and he was able to deal with the 6 of us while remaining playful yet attentive.  AMAZING guy!  We were seated outdoors with a view of the strip with the traffic and the throngs of drunks and tourists! If its a nice day out, I would definitely choose to sit outdoors!  Another friend ordered another drink, a mojito-like one with cranberries, and it was WAY too sour for my taste.

The menu looked similar New Yorks, HOWEVER there were menu items that were made specially for the Las Vegas location. We ended up ordering:

Popcorn & Shrimp
Popcorn shrimp served with popcorn! :) My friend squeezed lemon all over this and we had our choices of creamy sauces on the side.  The shrimp was delicious, the batter not being too heavy or cloying.  

Breakfast Steak Sandwich
Get this if you're hungover. A New York steak cooked to order was topped with 4-5 eggs, all piled on a 12 inch crunchy baguette.  The baguette is as crunchy as a Lee's Sandwiches' Banh Mi.  With that said, there's a chance its crunchy enough to cut the roof of your mouth ;) Other than the fact that she wished she ordered the steak cooked medium, she was happy with it. Runny yolks over meat and crispy bread? Rawr.

The Rachel Sandwich
I opted for the Sweet Potato Fries with this order.  The fries were meh, I'd try the chips next time or stick with waffle fries.  Although I'm not much of a fan of coleslaw, a newbie to pastrami, and not a fan of raisins, this sandwich was AMAZING.  The Rachel sandwich is the female counterpart to the Reuben; a rich hefty portion of well-seasoned pastrami piled on with a crunchy, flavorful bed of coleslaw, all sandwiched on dark raisin bread.  The whole thing was then thrown onto a grill, for a crisp finish. Needless to say, I shared, but I pretty much ate the whole thing.

Pizza
Didn't taste this, but heard no complaints. Flat bread pizza, served on a paddle. Standard sauce and cheese topped with mushrooms.

Mac and Cheese
F*ing delish. Creamy and not-overly salty like many restaurants.  Noodles cooked to a great consistency with a killer combination of cheeses.

Deep Fried Oreos & Ice Cream
My friend ordered this for his entree and it was delicious and rich- the classier version of county fair food ;) Served in a large parfait glass on a plate to catch the melting ice cream and overflowing chocolate sauce. The consistency of the whipped cream was something we couldn't get over.  It was thick and wouldn't melt like standard whipped cream, yet was still SO airy and light.  Must've been made fresh. The oreos themselves were fried correctly, and was abundant in the dessert, with my friend finding another one or two in hiding.

ABC Burger
This was the Avocado, Brie, and Caramelized Onions burger, served with standard burger toppings on the side.  Magical freakin combination!  My friend ordered this with waffle fries which were perfectly crispy and fresh. 

Frrrozen Hot Chocolate
One of those things you just kind of have to get once. Delish.

All this with various sodas and waters, which were constantly refilled. Allen was able to split our checks, told you he was amazing!

Can't complain about the number of people here since it is a local hotspot! Sometimes, I am disappointed in their service though, it takes a while for them to make your food even if it's just an appetizer. It's like they're still growing the vegetables or catching the cow in the back. This is why I only come here for the FHC!

By serendipitous coincidence (which if you read my profile - this is what I love) I ended up at Serendipity 3 for dessert.  Do I get double serendipity points for having a serendipitous coincidence at a restaurant called Serendipity?  

That aside - we got here at 8 pm and it was still pretty busy.  We were waiting for patio seats in the restaurant since the quick dining option outside didn't have any dessert.  We got seated 15 minutes later and found out there was plenty of empty seats on the patio so I wasn't quite sure why they made us wait.  Is this another one of those Vegas things I will never understand?

Anyway, between the 3 of us we ordered the frozen hot chocolate, a strawberry ice cream sundae, and the cheesecake.  Little did we know what we had in store for us.  The frozen hot chocolate was a treat, especially with the almonds.  A rich, sweet and satisfying drink.

However the real page turner was when the cheesecake came out.  As the cheesecake approached us - 3 jaws dropped.  I thought to myself - are you sure that's for me and not that table of 10 across the way?  This thing could have been its own cake!  

Because of its massiveness, I was afraid this hunk of cake would suffer the restaurant chain rule and be either (1) yucky\/inedible or (2) generic tasting.  I was actually wrong.  The cake wasn't too sweet, not too creamy or gelatinous, but simple and most importantly, it didn't taste like it came from the freezer section at Costco.  Score!  I gave it my best shot, along with my 2 other dining companions, and at most we got through half of it.  I would definitely eat their desserts here again but next time bring more people!",1,1,1

Awesome.).  We thought we'd grow old and die before being seated, so we checked out their other options: 1) the to-go line outside of the restaurant and 2) order to-go at the bar.

If you order to-go outside, you use a menu with limited options (but some of the same items are slightly cheaper than on the regular menu).  We don't go to Vegas often, so we decided to order at the bar and to just take our food to the tables outside of the hotel.  It was a nice option since the line was considerably shorter.

We ordered the black and white sundae ($15ish), a frozen hot chocolate ($9ish), and a grilled cheese sandwich ($15ish).  The prices were a bit of a kick in the pocketbook, but it all tasted great.  The grilled cheese sandwich had swiss, american, cheddar (I think?), and brie, and it was AMAZING.  It also came with yummy tomato soup.  I know they're famous for their frozen hot chocolate (which tastes exactly like how it sounds), but I actually enjoyed the black and white sundae more.

The seating sucked though. I know the area doesn't belong specifically to Serendipity 3, but c'mon, Ceasar's Palace!  Invest in a bus boy to clean up the tables at least once a century!  Especially if those tables sit right between your glitzy hotel and an expensive eatery!  It kind of ruined the ambiance eating our expensive, delicious food while sitting at sticky, filthy tables.

You will wait for possibly up to 45 minutes to be seated and trust me when I say, it's not worth the time. We got seated directly next to the kitchen, it seems like they moved a table there just to get us seated but it really didn't fit so we were completely in the walkway and awkwardly positioned. It made it difficult to enjoy the meal because we had to keep moving our chairs to let people get by or staff was coming out of the kitchen with food and we had to shift our chairs to let them by. We were able to see right into the kitchen because there is nothing separating it from the walkway we were seated in - we literally timed people's food sitting under lamp warmers after being prepared for 15-20 minutes. What's worse is that when our food arrived after waiting for about 35-40 minutes for it to be prepared...it was cold...I mean cold like it came from a fridge and were some leftovers you're about to eat the next morning with a hangover  type cold...I guess all of the heating lamps were being used!! To make it worse, the server was one of the worst I've ever had - he wasn't familiar with the menu and when we asked him any questions regarding options he got irritated and rude. We had a party of 5 people and dined for about 1 hour and 20 minutes around 5 PM and our server only checked on us twice: when he took the order and when he dropped off the checks. It was so bad that we had to get up from our table and go to the hot chocolate bar for refills on our beverages (soda and water)...once at the bar no one was there to assist us or even offer their services so we actually had one person in our group get behind the counter and refill our drinks for us!

When we finally got in we were seated on their outside deck, close to one of the mist fans that was partially broken. It kept dripping water on one of my friends. 

We quickly decided and tried to flag down our waitress.  It was incredibly hot outside and we wanted something to drink. Water took a while to come out and when we were ready to order our waitress took her time getting to us, giving us the index finger ""one minute"" signal while she continued to gab away with a coworker.

What a huge mistake!! It was by far the worst service I have ever had and what makes it so bad is we only had dessert. First off, we waited about 20 minutes for our waiter to take our drink order, then another 10 for that to be served to us and then another 30 minutes for our desserts to come out. To top it off the dessert wasn't even that amazing. But what made it such a bad experience, I mean enough for me to write a review because I don't ever write reviews but this one I couldn't let go.

So I finally walk up front to the hostess and ask him can we please pay our bill, we've been sitting there waiting for 30 minutes. He says he will get our waiter. Still no sign. Then we ask another waiter and finally he takes our bill to the back and gives it to our server. Finally 10 minutes he walks out with our credit card slips. Guess what bud no tip for you!!

First, it had been raining the day we went and while we were seated in a nice area to get a view of the fountain it turned into a puddle as soon as the rains picked up again.  One would think that they would have asked us if we wanted to move to another table that wasn't being affected by the rain?  However, that wasn't the case at all.  Instead, a few of the servers came by and laid down additional towels to soak up the water while we tried to eat our food.  This not only presented a horrible smell but really, it could have been a potential risk to the restaurant should myself or someone in party happen to slip because of the water or towels.  

Second, the service.  Well, there was a lack of it to be honest.  While they were changing shifts the young lady laying down the towels began to complain about the fact that she always had the ethnic tables and upset that she had to work the side that was being damaged by the water and worse yet that she even had to work.  Mind you this was all in Spanish.  Low and behold, the ""sweet"" smile that came to fill our water glasses was the same young lady complaining in Spanish.  At this point, I was starting to become irritable.  I work in the retail and service industry, while I expect the best out of my staff, I usually expect the worse when going to a restaurant but this was starting to draw the line.

Finally, the food.  We went for lunch and let me tell you, I could have had a better lunch at the local Denny's.  The food was soo below average.  We ordered the steak sandwich and hot dog.  I would only recommend eating a real meal at any other place and then coming here for desert.  The food here was so lack luster.

I ordered the Central Park omelet, which came with a small amount of spinach and cheese inside, as well as a few skinny slices of avocado on top. The menu states egg whites, but they must use some kind of Egg Beaters stuff out of a carton because it definitely did not taste like fresh egg whites (plus it was yellow). Not only did it taste horrible, but it smelled pretty bad too. I'm never one to waste food, but I couldn't even finish half the omelet. The side of breakfast potatoes were skimpy and tasted stale.  

Service was disappointing. Only really saw the server when she took our order and dropped off the check. I asked if she could place a candle on my sister's waffle for her birthday in which she said of course...didn't happen. I guess she was too busy flirting with the group of men at the next table.

We came here around 6ish and ordered the ""party like its your birthday"" cake (it was on food networks ""best thing I ate"" show - 3 layers of neopolitan ice cream and 4 layers of funfetti vanilla cake) we also got 2 cappuccinos. I convinced my mom that we should get it that it would be worth the calories! 

Well. The cake was actually pretty bad. My mom eats almost anything and even she didn't want to eat it. It wasn't fresh and wasn't even good. How do you mess up bday cake and ice cream!!! And it was expensive. 
We were told the hotel next door bakes everything and serendipity staff just assemble the desserts, so it should be fresh, well I don't know what to say but it was awful. The whipped cream was stale too.. ._.

Also another awful anecdote to add to our awful bday cake, our server with this fake saccharine smile rubbed me the wrong way. She asked us if there was ""anything else we needed"" 7 times while we were there. You know that was a hint for us to leave. Why else would someone approach you that many times. What could we possibly need except you leaving us alone!! What a bad experience. And we only sat for about an hour. Dinner folks hadn't even arrived, we looked around to make sure we weren't being selfish and hogging a booth for one nasty slice of bday cake... But no, a lot of booths were open...

We've always passed by this place, saying to ourselves that one day we'll try that darn frozen hot chocolate. Well what do you know, as I was browsing through a booklet of coupons from the hotel, the coupon just magically jumped out and screamed. Free frozen hot chocolate with a $10 purchase.

Since the coupon was only valid for dine-in, we had no choice but to sit inside. The minute we sat down, it just felt weird to me. Everything was so girly and pink. Pastel colors everywhere. I immediately wanted to go to some grimy, hole-in-a-wall sports bar for some much needed ""cleansing."" But hey, I was gonna stick it out.

We looked up and down the ridiculously overpriced menu, searching for something fairly inexpensive to share. We settled on the chicken strips for a whopping $12. There were 6 strips, so $2 each, which is absurd. As expected, they were bad. Terribly dry, bland, and too thick of a crust. If they want a lesson on making good chicken strips, they need to hit up Raising Canes.

On to the frozen hot chocolate, which was surprisingly good, in my opinion. It did it's job. It was essentially a giant chocolate slushee with whipped cream on top. I'm a sucker for slurpees and slushees and icees, especially on a hot day. And it was free. Call me a fan. Would I order it again, though?

I try to follow my Mediterrenean diet but it backlashes quiet frequently. Seems like one country's Tortilla Española is another country's monster-sized Spanish omlette stuffed with veggy accompanied by sour cream n salsa with couple of Texas toasts on the sides. I'm not saying the food is not delicious. Quite often they are. Yet bigger is not always the better. 

Then you go to Serendipity... All the notions of healthy eating fade away.  Next thing I know I was tucked into the 'Forbidden Broadway Sundae' which is a MOUNTAINOUS chocolate blackout cake topped with chocolate vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, and hot fudge goodness embedded in the core. 

Eating dessert to me is what it means to shopping to most of the women. And I can affirm that each ingredient was carefully made and each were at the right consistency. Very very very DELICIOUS. But still it wasn't until I found serendipity when the hot chocolate fudge started leaking out from where it was hidden.  

The size of the desert was so BIG that my boyfriend lifted it up to see if it measures up to his head in size. I haven't eaten burgers, salads etc. but I saw on the other tables people eating and those dishes do not fall short of the desserts.  A portion of anything is definitely for 2 people.Whoever says the opposite, not true. Otherwise the half will get wasted just like lot of ppl did at the restaurant we saw.

The inevitable closure had been planned for weeks, with the popular tourist destination scheduling Jan. 1 as the final day to accept reservations. By Tuesday morning, the white furniture was being removed from the very covetous location, sitting almost flush with Las Vegas Boulevard.

Seibel, registered inmate number 77374-054, had been busted for hiding at least $1,011,279 in taxable earnings from the IRS. The money was hidden away in undeclared ""Swiss bank accounts and a Panamanian shell company.",16,13,2

However, I must say the portions and food quality is very impressive.  I just wanted a simple root beer float, but when my wife's hot chocolate ice cream came out, I couldn't keep my spoon out.  Holy molee that was delicious.  It was in a huge wide glass bowl with a three layer piece of chocolate cake with whipped cream on top of vanilla and chocolate ice cream swimming in hot chocolate.  I think the description speaks for it's self.  We hammered at this euphoric dish, and still left over half of it in the bowl.  YUMMY!!!!

The miniature tacos and piled high burgers looked incredible as well.  Sometimes you can just tell by looking at a dish that it is going to taste good.  Very pricey, but this is Vegas.  I would say the prices were very well stated as compared to anywhere else in Las Vegas.  However, there is a Sundae listed on the menu for $1000.  I did not see anyone order it, but if it didn't come with some kind of quality gold jewelry, I don't see how it could be worth it. 

I had to knock a star off for the 15 min wait and semi slow service.  It is a Sunday, and it did appear that no real management or leadership was in place.  I saw a lot of servers standing around waiting for something to do.  Meanwhile, four young girls stood behind the counter just chitchatting while half of the restaurant was empty.  It didn't make sense that people had to wait so long to be seated.  Additionally, when new customers came in, they didn't know they were supposed to check in and proceeded to an empty table.

We ordered the hot wings and chicken nachos as appetizers and me and my friend would just half a burger since we saw the burgers they were bringing out and they seemed pretty big. The burger that we got was the portobello burger and we got it with the all white chicken and opted for the fries instead of the coleslaw. 

Our food came within a reasonable amount of time. But when I tried the hot wings they tasted sweet with a weird flavor that I can't really explain, but it just was not good at all. We tried the nachos and the setup of putting the nachos in that long oval kind of plate isn't very good as it's hard to get the chips with all the toppings. The nachos were okay....I mean nothing special about them. Then we tried the burger and let me just tell you this.....DONT GET THE BURGERS.

THE FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE!

     It was SO GREAT I'm just going to list my top ten ways I'd describe it to a friend. Here goes, they are the following: 

1. Greek God Worthy
2. HolyHotChocolateBatman
3. The Facebook of Desserts
4. Nothing On Earth Like It on Earth
5. #Dessert Hashtag Warranted

7. Yummy in My Tummy
8. A Full Body Massage in a Cup
9. 112 Points on Words With Friends
10. 14 out 10 people will like this, trust me

You're going to love it as much as I did for sure! Let me know what you think! :D


THE FRIED OREO SUNDAE!

     If you come in with at least 1 person with you, you have to order something like this. Just from a standpoint of picture taking and memories, it's an unforgettable moment that you will remember forever. It's a priceless food fun photo opp, followed by an EPIC journey for sure for any DESSERT LOVER! It was soooo much fun to attempt to make it through as much of the bowl as I could. Deep breathing techniques and stretching in my chair was not enough to overpower and complete this Colossal Sundae... As I stared it square in the face I decided my best bet about half way through was to finish off the FRIED OREOS! YES They are so delicious and if you haven't had them, then you need to order this one just to try em! They are that GREAT! 


ENTREE - CRAB CAKE SALAD

     I was soooooo impressed by how great the food was here! I ordered a CRAB CAKE SALAD which I can say with certainty was one of the BEST CRAB CAKES in Vegas. Bar none. It looked perfect (check out my picture of it in their photos) ... it tasted perfect! and it was surrounded by a fantastic salad made up of an awesome blend of greens tossed with a light and delicious dressing. 


ENTREE -         was ""BEST OF MY LIFE""

     I also have to quote one more plate I had here, and it's something I thought i'd never be stating a had a ""BEST OF MY LIFE"" of ... because it's something I've had, and you reading this, have probably had a million times in your life. CHICKEN FINGERS! I swear to you that I was challenged they would be some of the best I'd ever eaten... Well let me tell you if you just wanted to try a food that someone has truly mastered, I mean really, cannot get any better then they were, then order these. (You'll see a picture of them as well I posted in their photos). The breading is absolutely the precise amount, somewhere between Southern Fried thickness and Tempura style crispness. And furthermore, they are so tender you will wonder what in the world they do to them to get them this way... If you're a meat eater, think ""kobe"" tenders, that's what these are. : ) They are truly done that well! A test of all the willpower you have in your entire body would be to order these and just eat 1. Have fun and definitely try them when you go! : ) 


My Final Thought... 
     Totally have fun and enjoy this restaurant! It's a great time, the people there are so friendly, and the experience you'll have there is one you'll never forget, no matter how many times you visit back. :D  

Enjoy, 
Henry : )

minus a star for the price, too- i realize this is vegas, and i realize this is novel..but it was damn near $40 for frozen hot chocolate (which i think is $9-kinda ridiculous if you think about it.  really, it's a chocolate milk shake, and no matter how delicious it is, it shouldn't be $9), potato skins, and chicken tenders.  yes, the portions were huge.  yes, it's vegas and everything's expensive, i get it.  but still.  there's nothing really inherently special about the menu, and everything is super duper pricey- i remember seeing salads and burgers for $12-$15.  slices of pie for around $7 or so.  

the food is tasty, i'll give you that, and possibly hip and trendy...but as far as i'm concerned, not worth the $$ they ask you for.  i was lucky and fortunate enough that my girlfriend bought me lunch as a birthday gesture.  i'd eat here again, if other people wanted to go, and it was tasty enough that i'd recommend it to people..with the stipulation that it was very pricey for what you get. 

the atmosphere is cute.",0,0,0

The To Go menu has a lot less attractive items on the menu.  The wait was still very long for bf & I to get our kobe sliders & fries.  And Janice C. who was behind us her salad came after the order of the guy behind her!  Who puts one cook in such a popular To Go window of the restaurant?!  

The kobe sliders weren't bad, but $9 for 3 of them...geeze...happy hour somewhere else would have been cheaper!  The fries were alright too, wish they were a little crispier however.  I had a sip of my friend's frozen hot chocolate, it was alright, nothing special really and not worth $10!  The outdoor seating was kind of limited, but luckily there were a couple empty tables which were not tended to.  The misters could have been stronger and better aimed.

This was my third time here. Decent place to eat when you visit Vegas since the buffets aren't as great as they use to be........

Me and my friend got two orders to split in half to try them both, both were really excellent!

I got the hangover omelette not the best but defitnitley one of my favorites it consisted of fries tomato bacon cheese and much more and it comes with a side of sweet potato or regular fries. Overall a great omelette.

My buddy got the blue cheese burger. The burger was very well grilled the bun was nice and fresh and the blue cheese was the perfect complement with the bacon and beef.

However the frozen hot chocolate was really good the first two times the third time its not as great (maybe because it was winter and cold as crap) but it was still good.

The Frozen Hot Chocolate is nothing but a glorified Starbucks Frappuccino for triple the price. The cup size is way smaller than I had expected for an $11 drink. Perhaps you pay for the ambience and experience when you sit in the restaurant, but the to-go line is a definite no-go. The whipped cream is also coming out of a generic brand can, so it's also great knowing that you're paying for such fine quality.

We ended up trying the white chocolate and double chocolate frozen hot chocolates. I really didn't know what to expect.

Nope, mindfuck, it's just a cold chocolate drink that ended up being overly sweet, especially the white chocolate. Probably won't ever try this again.

FOOD: Between the three of us we shared:
- Thai Beef Salad: quite large (which made up for the $16.50 price tag), very flavorful. Lots of random inedible add-ins though (uncooked vermicelli noodles, half a coconut in shell, etc). 
- Side of Steak Fries: not your typical steak fries, these had an additional bread crumb (??) coating on the outside that made them extra crispy. Yum.

There's a window at the side of Serendipity where you could order a to-go version of their stuff. Bad thing, you don't get your frozen hot chocolate in the pretty glass cup unless you dine-in.  

I ordered the regular sized frozen hot chocolate and initially thought to myself ""$8.25!? This better be some good ish!"" Once sip of the stuff and I was hooked! I regret not having more of it before I left Vegas because ever since I've been back in LA I've been having FHC withdrawals! (FHC = FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE) I also ordered the cheese pizza, but that's not even worth mentioning. 

Mark my words...I will be back very soon for some more of you, FHC!",1,0,0

I am a New Yorker who has been to the original a few times.  The big disappointment about this place for me is that it has lost most of the charm of the original.  I didn't mind not having to wait outside online for over an hour like you would at the Gotham original, but most of the kitsch factor wasn't translated to the Sin City outpost.  In its place is a manufactured and sanitary ""coolness"" that comes across as too cute by half.

The Frrrrozen Hot Chocolate is, of course, excellent, as many other reviewers have touched upon.  The mac and cheese pizza was an interesting and tasty dish.  Service was competent, though a little sluggish.  I'm giving this one a low rating because I feel that there are better places to go in Vegas, and anyone who wants the Serendipity 3 experience would be better suited to check out the one in New York.

Frozen white hot chocolate w\/ sprinkles : the first few sips were awesome but as I kept sipping...it was wayy too sweet for me. BF likes white chocolate so thats why we ordered it. 

Foot Long Chili Cheese Dog : what a delight! it was so good and just enough for the both of us to share. it even had chucks of ...i think steak or beef in there.

Buffalo Chicken Pizza : interesting twist ...instead of a marinara sauce, it was the buffalo sauce with chucks of chicken and bleu cheese. We weren't a fan of the bleu cheese...it was quite strong.

The restaurant is super adorable on the outside, with Barbie-pink accents and Hello Kitty plush toys on display. But as soon as you walk inside, Serendipity was underwhelming, boxy, and nothing special!  So we were glad to sit outside on the patio, even though it was your typical 100 degree day in Vegas!

The Food
The menu options were plentiful - a little something for everyone.  We were all in a burger mood - Carrie (yours truly :P) ordered the veggie burger (I only ate half, that says it all!),  and Miranda had the crab cake burger (which she let me taste - now THAT was worth looking a little bulgy in your Vegas clubbing dress for!)  Charlotte and Samantha both ordered a traditional burger that they both inhaled (they were quiet for a good ten minutes lol!)  Not that I could blame them, we all didn't have a bite to eat since 5am that morning coming home from Surrender! ;)

The Frozen Hot Chocolate
Sigh.  Serendipity's trademark drink was nothing but hot chocolate served cold with whipped cream, literally.  No ""how did they do that?!?"" reaction like when I ordered deep-fried ice cream for the first time.   I envisioned some kind of chocolate slushy!

The Serendipitous Moment
So the four girlfriends sat around their table, chatting, laughing, and devising grandiose plans for the night ahead, while picking at their French fries.

Lucky enough that a very nice bartender Veronica, went completely out of her way to take care of us. She even confronted the lady who was supposed to be our waitress and turned out no one wanted to tend my table. If it wasn't for Veronica going out of her way for us I don't think anyone would have taken our order. Big thank you to Veronica for caring and making sure we were taken care of.",2,0,0

I finally tasted it...what everyone's talking about - the famous frozen hot chocolate.  I think it's a bit hyped up...I was expecting a little more.  It was an extra large chocolate slush.  It was good but not to die for.  The price on that thing is pretty hefty too - $13.00 for a drink.  Yoikes!  Nonetheless, now I can say I've tried a famous frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity!",0,0,0

About 30% of Serendipity 3 was empty inside and out.   Great right?  No- they would not seat the 3 of us because ""they did not have enough servers"".  I asked could we just sit in one of the empty tables and wait, we could just wait with a glass of water.  They said ""no, but you can sit at the bar"".  OK- if you have ever seen Serendipity 3, does it make sense to have only 3 servers?  2 people were acting as Hostess.  Perhaps they could have thought, ""Gee, we are understaffed, maybe a Hostess should become immediately a Waitress to cover the restaurant."" Nope. And so we  crammed into the bar area while a bunch of tables were just left empty.  Nice. Now, let me say, the waitress we eventually had was very nice and the bartender was working hard.  BUT, the restaurant was not full and it took a LONG time to receive our ordered food.  4pm on the Vegas Strip, not 4AM!

That being said, the food tasted good and the Frozen Hot Chocolate was a home run hit.  

So park at the Caesar's parking lot, walk all the way through the casino, and good luck if you think you will be easily seated at Serendipity 3 when it is 30% empty.",0,0,0

Cut to the food - very good Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Crab Cake Sandwich. The wraps were very moist and flavorful, the crab cake had very little filler and so much crab - 5 stars for food and  her drink. But back to the service, while we were dining,  he was doing his side work, refilling salt and pepper shakers without excusing himself as he reached over us.

It's located just outside of Caesar's Palace, and is considered one of the more ""affordable"" restaurants in Vegas.  I put affordable in quotes, because it's obviously a relative term.  It's still not exactly cheap, but the food and desserts are both really good.  First off, the portion size of the sandwiches and burgers are huge.  I had a burger on our first visit, It had bacon and blue cheese on it, and came with a ton of fries.   Their sandwiches could most definitely be split between two people if you aren't starving hungry.  If you eat a whole sandwich or burger by yourself, trust me you won't have room for dessert.  My wife and I learned this on our second trip, as we simply spilt a chicken sandwich and fries, which was more than plenty for the both of us.

We splurged and got this cookie sundae for dessert.  It was huge!  It came with a few scoops of cookie dough ice cream, and had a few homemade cookies on top, along with hot fudge and whipped cream.  Makes me hungry just thinking about it now.  If you split a meal and a dessert, you can walk out of here for less than $40 including tip.  Some folks may consider that expensive.  Again, affordable is a relative term. :)

If you are in Caesar's or nearby and you are craving dessert then go to the Forum Shops and check out Max Brenner's.  The food a Serendipity is not that spectacular, the desserts are large but are not overwhelmingly tasty. The service is extremely spotty for a prime location on the Vegas Strip.

THE WAIT: It was kind of confusing. I understand waiting in line to get in (small space by the way).  But why did we have to wait once we were notified that our table was ready? We waited with five other families for another 5 minutes after being texted that our table was ready. Is that bad planning, or careful design? It was hard to tell. 

THE SERVICE: The hostess and wait staff were strong. They were attentive and polite in spite of being incredibly busy. BUT I don't understand why a hostess would be tasked with busing tables. I am hoping they were short-handed and need to ""make it work."" That doesn't explain why she kept leaving the cleaning rag behind the podium. If you can, avoid being seated by the hostess stand. It seemed uncomfortable for the two groups forced to sit there. There was a food expediter in full view making sure the dishes looked good (correct, clean plates). It was nice to see his process as he carefully attended to each plate.  

AMBIANCE: Serendipity 3 is serving visual ""CHARM"" and ""WHIMSY"" in droves. From the decor to the menus to the food. While it's gimmicky, it works. It looks like a young girl's tea party fantasy.  

SAVORY DISHES: They were tasty. Everything was visually appealing and massive. We had the grilled  cheese with soup, the potato bites, the chicken satay wraps, and the Ahi salad.  It wasn't earth shattering, but we didn't expect it to be. We all liked our food well enough, but I would have been happy with a regular portion that had better flavor. I suppose the super-sized portions were a nod to the aforementioned WHIMSY.  

But no one goes to Serendipity 3 for the savory dishes, right? 

DESSERT: Among us we had the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, Red Velvet Sundae, and a Black and White Sundae.  Everything was good. It was sweet, and gooey (when appropriate), and rich. And massive.  

I have no complaints about Serendipity 3. But I also have no compliments. I don't think it's fair to compare the Vegas location to the one in NY.  The purpose here is to have a tasty meal to accompany a decadent dessert in a carefully planned ""WHIMSICAL"" location.

My husband and I ordered a salad and we asked the waitress if we should order 1 or 2 frozen hot chocolate and she suggested 1 since we ordered something else.  The frozen hot chocolate was delicious, it taste like a milkshake but definitely not as thick as a normal milkshake.  I will definitely go back there for the frozen hot chocolate.

They have a large indoor seating area that is kind of reminiscent of a candy store\/50s diner hybrid. We didn't actually get food there, or sit in the restaurant for that matter. We were in search of the frozen hot chocolate we had heard so much about. The indoor seating area was pretty packed when we went so we went to the bar\/patio area outside that is facing the strip. 

The bartender was very nice and had our frozen hot chocolate out in a jiffy. Needless to say, the cold drink hit the spot on that scorching day. However, while the coldness of the drink cooled me down, I realized that the hot chocolate powder doesn't really dissolve leaving a kind of gritty and super sugary taste. Also, in the outdoor seating area, they spray water mist, which was both great and a little uncomfortable at the same time while I was trying to enjoy my drink. The mist was starting to form a layer of water on my skin, I could only imagine what it could do to my food. It was $17 for a double size frozen hot chocolate which was also a little pricey in my opinion. All together, if you have a big sweet tooth and are looking to have something on a hot day, this might be the place (and treat) for you if you are willing to spend money.

I originally would have rated Serendipity 3 maybe two or three stars, more because of the ambience and its cutesy decor, and our service was pretty good, but everything we ate was VERY subpar and overpriced. Why one star then? Well..

After I paid about $36 (tips included) for a $14 drink and a lame-ass $16 sandwich, I went home and spent the rest of the night doubled over with extreme, vastly unpleasant stomach pain. I don't know which food item caused it, but I'm talking about stomach pain that made me want to curl up next to the toilet and wish I had never visited Serendipity 3. 

We started off with a frozen hot chocolate for my friend and a ""Raspberry Truffle"" (frozen hot choc + chambord + some other things) for me. The frozen hot chocolate was okay but I've had much better in Austin. The ""Raspberry Truffle"" was decent-tasting and was HUGE but the chocolate shavings and such were tasteless and didn't add much to the drink. Also, it got way too sweet after awhile so I didn't finish it.

Next, entrees. My friend's salad looked mediocre. But $15 for a small-ish BBQ chicken pizza that Pizza Hut could have made better? And here's what I got.. $16 for an ""Open Bries"" sandwich with one slice of bread, a mound of sliced turkey very much like the packaged kind one gets at their local supermarket, a few slices of apple and some mayo with cranberries, topped with a few slices of brie? Yeah the sandwich was kind of huge, not to mention ridiculously hard to eat, but  the side that came with it (excellently seasoned waffle fries) was far tastier than the main dish. The concoction would have been better had it been fresh turkey.. not to mention more deserving of the $16 price tag.

Don't come here.. not worth the price and potential wrath of hell to be instilled in your stomach.",1,0,0

I thought it was gonna be spectacular too.  By the way, you'd want to order the small since the order for 2 is large enough to feed 4 adults unless you want a sugar high.  My recommendation is a 3\/5.

The entrees sampled are the crispy chicken salad and the crab cake sandwiches.  The crispy chicken salad is your regular old green salad with dressing of your choice.  What's different about it is the large fried chicken pieces that comes with it.  If you want to order a salad just to be conservative on the calories, you might want to eat less of the chicken and more of the greens.  Overall, the crispy chicken salad is 3\/5 but the chicken gives it a +1 so it turns out to be 4\/5.  The crab cake sandwich is just a plain old crab cake sandwich with an inflated price.  That's a 3\/5.

Overall, this place is between 3 and 4 stars with more leaning towards 3 stars.  Still, it's a nice place to go for a cold dessert on a hot desert summer day.",1,0,0

On a recent trip to Las Vegas, the group of girls that I was with was trying to decide on a place to have dinner. One of the girls recommended Serendipity, and being that we were all somewhat drunk and hungry, we agreed. Well, we showed up and since the weather was nice outside we elected to sit out on the patio that is right next to 'The Strip' and had a great view of all the lights and passer-bys. Unfortunately, the allure of sitting on the patio stopped at the view. To start, it was almost as if they put us out on the patio and proceeded to completely forget that they put us there. When we were seated we were told that someone would be by shortly to take our drink orders... I guess they didn't know how thirsty we were and what a buzz kill they were being, because our waiter didn't come by for about 15 minutes. 

Aside from my gripe about the slow service on the patio is the fact that about a half hour into dinner there was literally, and I kid you not, a wind storm that erupted. So bad in fact, that one of our friends who had a 7 p.m. flight into Vegas had her flight grounded and delayed until the following morning due to wind. So, as silverware was blowing off of tables and napkins went flying, we tried to flag down our waiter to be moved inside. The response that we received was; ""If you want to move inside then you are going to have to put your name on the waiting list and wait for a table to open inside. The current wait is an hour."" Ummm... what?! We had drinks in hand and appetizers on the table and you're telling me that we would have to put our name on the waiting list? You are SO accommodating! Thank you! (Those last two statements were completely laced with sarcasm.)

I guess I should talk about the food now. Oh, and for those of you wondering: we stayed out on the patio throughout our whole meal... good times. Anyways... for dinner I started with a caesar salad and then ordered buffalo chicken strips for dinner. The salad was fine; How could you screw up caesar salad? The buffalo chicken strips were ok. They weren't crispy and steaming hot like I wanted, but at least it was sustenance. When the chicken strips arrived it looked as if they had sat on the counter waiting to get run to our table for a few minutes too long. The sauce had gotten cold and had pulled off some of the crispy breading. However, give a girl some ranch dressing and blue cheese and she can make anything taste decent.",4,1,3

If you have to use the restroom, do it before you go in. It's located outside a little ways away from the restaurant.

I ordered the frozen hot chocolate, which is exactly what it sounds like.  It's huuuge and needs to be shared.  It's like an icy chocolate milkshake that has that hot cocoa taste and it's covered with a mound of whipped cream.  A couple of sips and I was done.  Whew.  

I don't see how this is different from any other  ice cream shoppe anywhere else.  

Pros: if you have to have ice cream on the Strip, this is a good choice

Cons: expensive, the ice cream is just ice cream, lots of noisy kids, no charm",0,0,0

On a typical summer Sunday, your wait will be pretty long for a large group. The restaurant itself is fairly small in Vegas standards, so be prepared. We were seated on the outside patio, because that's the only place that could accommodate a group of 12. Even though it was in the shade, it was HOT. Blazing Vegas hot. For some odd reason, the mist fans don't come on until noon, so we were left there sitting for an hour without any relief but our water. It's really not that hard to turn off the timers, guys...

The meal itself was nothing special. I ordered the Fried Chicken & Waffles, which came with 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, one bacon waffle, potatoes, honey mustard and ketchup. The chicken was heavily breaded and was pretty dried out and flavorless. The only thing that added taste to it was the honey mustard. The bacon waffles were alright initially, but they get pretty unbearable after 1\/4 of a waffle. The entire dish is just bland and flavorless. I understand they're trying to be unique here with the bacon waffles, but it's definitely not worth $22. 

For the finale, all of us got the famed highly spoken of frozen hot chocolate. This was the biggest disappointment of the day. For $11, you're basically paying for a huge watered down chocolate milk with some whipped cream on top. That's exactly how it tastes. I experienced no wow factor and I seriously don't see what all the hype is about. It cools you down, but other than that, it's not that great.",0,0,1

The menu consists of a variety of American-style food, desserts and drinks. The must try here is the amazing frrrozen hot chocolate. 

I have visited the restaurant on multiple occasions. My bridesmaids took me here for the first time for my bachelorette party. The wait for the restaurant was long, so we opted to order from the outside window. The frrrozen hot chocolate drink was served in a to-go cup, and we got multiple straws to share. I came on another occasion with my husband, and we were able to get a table inside the restaurant. The frrrozen hot chocolate drink had a more appealing and fun presentation served in a glass cup, which made the experience more enjoyable for me. 

The frrrozen hot chocolate is humongous, chocolatey and delicious. I love the rich cocoa flavor of the drink, and it is finished off with whipped cream topping and chocolate shavings. This is definitely worth making a special stop at to experience when in Vegas.

Service was friendly and prompt. They are busy during peak times, so be prepared to wait for a table in the restaurant especially with a bigger group.

1) Service: The wait is so not warranted. I suppose it was ""busy"" considering they probably had about the same number of hostesses as waiters. There was a bunch of open tables while they were telling people there was a 45 min wait. Thank goodness we had a reservation. Our waiter was honest in telling our visitor that they are not known for food as they are for sweet treats but made his recommendations. What he should've done is tell us to go somewhere else in exchange for his tip upfront for saving us from this disappointment.

2) Food: They ran out of that Las Vegas Strip Steak sandwich. Ummm it's a wknd and they're not adequately stocked with one of their most popular dishes? So that already ticked me off. My second choice was the crab cake sandwich only because it was about half the price of just the jumbo lump crab cake. It was good the first couple bites, but then I guess the grease finally got the best of me. And the high heel pump sandwich was just whatever as well.

The salad a picture perfect presentation and the steak melted in my mouth.

We ended up coming here immediately off the plane (on a Wednesday) and after we checked into our hotel. We got lucky and found a Groupon here and really just wanted some frozen hot chocolate and appetizers to tie us over until dinner time, without having to eat a full meal. So we came in probably around 2PM - and the place is for the most is empty - we had our choice of sitting outside or inside, and we chose a center booth inside. The location of the restaurant is great - it's right on the strip - with outside seating facing the strip in front of Caesar's Palace - you get some good foot traffic here so it's good people watching :)

Of note, even though it doesn't say so on your Groupon (fine print), you cannot utilize your Groupon with the Total Rewards (players card) discount. Not a big deal, it's a $1 savings, but it would be nice if they actually told us that. I'll also say - the waiters aren't super knowledgeable or they play stupid because they don't want a ""discounted tip"" - because our waiter told us we can't use our Groupon at all unless it's for full menu meals (non-appetizers). We again did not see any of this in the fine print, so we asked our waiter to ask his manager, who after 10 minutes visible begrudgingly came out and said yes we could use the Groupon for anything.

We ordered a large frozen hot chocolate ($17) and nachos ($18) - which was MORE than enough food to tie us over until dinner. It was a wonderful afternoon snack. Everything tasted GREAT - the frozen hot chocolate did not disappoint and neither did the nachos. So good job Serendipity on that! I've been to the Serendipity in NYC and the frozen hot chocolate is consistent and just as delicious in Vegas :)

The reason for the down score of 1 star - our waiter made some off handed rude comments about what we ordered - granted we ordered 1 desert drink and an appetizer for 2 people - we are not particularly large people, rather average - and he made a comment about being fat and eating too much - which we let slide as it was our first hour in Vegas - but I will say the looks from the table next to us was like WTF. They even commented to us at the end of their meal that it was ridiculous and totally unfounded what the waiter said (clearly tip was now a factor as we were not going to be insulted and tip 20% on pre-discounted meal - we tipped 15% on the pre-discounted meal - also begrudgingly).",5,1,1

Though I thought it was good and the restaurant had a nice staff in the side snack bar and had a cute, kitschy look overall, I still think it is a little silly to pay $9 or whatever it is for a beverage that some might view as a cousin of the mocha frappucino. The chocolate used is yummy, the whipped cream is fresh, and the cool contrast of a rich drink you'd expect to have warm is appealing, but it's hard not to overlook this place as just an overpriced Vegas tourist trap. Not to mention you're gonna need a fat water to actually quench your thirst after slamming down one of these.

Their vast menu makes ordering quite a task as you want to try everything. One cannot come here without trying the frozen hot chocolate. I have always associated Serendipity with frozen hot chocolates, but their other desserts are worthy of experiencing, too.

The only thing(s) I did not quite enjoy which most will think I am absolutely crazy are the fans blowing in the outside seating area.

I had 'crab cake benedit' and my friends had 'the one and only las vegas style steak breakfast sandwich' and waffle.  The benedit and sandwich tasted good, which were A+.  I really enjoyed the egg yolk running between the jumbo crab cake, it is really delicious not only because im a fan of pouch eggs and crab cakes, but because the hollandaise sauce was tailored made for both of them.  Second thought, serendipity got to make these plates right because they are $30 benedit and $20 sandwich.  

However my poor waffle friend had to return his waffle coz it was totally soggy and seemed half done.  Poor guy had to watch us eat.  haha...  The waitress was nice enough to give him a new one however he didnt have much luck on the second one.  The second one was burnt, but he was starving so he had to take it.  poor guy.  I guess this place can make either soggy or burn waffle only.

I have no clue why everybody else is crazy for this 'frozen hot chocolate' thing.  It is a $10 chocolate smoothie.  I cant see why people crazy for it.  I tried couple sips, which tasted like other chocolate smoothies.  Nothing special.

Last week I decided to give it a try.   Had to try the signature Frozen Hot Chocolate, of course.  Since D and I were starving when we got there, we also ordered a jalepeno pretzel and a cheese pizza.  

Frozen Hot Chocolate - First of all, it was 10 bucks for a size comparable to Starbucks Grande size.  Second of all, it tasted worse than a grande chocolate frapachino.  Nasty powder chunks in the drink, and not even very chocolatey.  Save your money and your taste buds, go to starbucks.

Jalepeno Pretzel - 8 bucks.  Totally not worth it.  Tasted like spicy cardboard.  Go eat some desert sand.  I'm sure it will taste better.

Cheese Pizza - 10 bucks.  Tasted like a 5 year old made a pizza in an Easy Bake Oven.

But it's a trap that is still fun to take the kids. Desserts are the main draw here, with plenty of frozen hot chocolate and sundae options available. Portion sizes for desserts and all other food are huge, so sharing is the best option.

Dessert was the main reason my son and I stopped by, but we knew we had to eat some real food for dinner before indulging in sweets. The crab cake sandwich ($19) was massive.  A jumbo lump crab cake with a tolerable amount of filler was topped with beefsteak tomatoes, avocado, and an orange aioli. Those savory items with hints of sweetness sat in between an unusually large bun. The only ways to eat it are to smash it down to fit in your mouth or grab a knife and fork and eat it one small piece at a time. An order of the kid's chicken strips ($8.95) come 3 per order with a honey mustard sauce and ranch, along with carrot and celery sticks that my son avoided like the plague. He wasn't crazy about the chicken either. Suffering from a hard breading covering dry meat, he barely finished half his meal. 

Moving on to what we both viewed as the ""main course"" we quickly agreed on the red velvet sundae ($14). Substituting chocolate for the vanilla ice cream listed on the menu, the massive dessert served in a goblet had a large chunk of moist and dense cake stuck to one side with hot fudge, whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles topping it all. It was plenty satisfying, but far from refined. The quality doesn't warrant the hefty price tag as it's a dessert that one can replicate at home for far less.

I realize that Saturday nights on the Vegas strip are busy no matter where you go but it just seemed like there was no structure or organization here. Servers and bussers were running around, the hostess was nowhere to be found and after standing there for a good 5 minutes without so much as a hello from anyone, we decided to just go to the outside window and order. 

The line was long but moved pretty quickly. We each got a frozen hot chocolate. All I can say is that although it was good, in no way, shape or form was it worth $12. I suppose you go for the ambiance so had we been able to get properly noticed inside and had been able to enjoy it there, it may have been worth the cost. However, being completely ignored by the employees and having to wait outside in the cold for a $12 drink that I'm quite certain I could have made just as well at home is NOT my idea of a hit out of the park.

Service:
Our server was really cool and really took care of us.  She put up with annoying jokes and was all smiles.  She brought out our food quickly and checked back on us frequently.

Food:
A friend got the hang-over omelet and it was huge.  It was probably enough food to feed a starving family.

The crab and artichoke dip was done quite well with large pieces of crab meat.  The dish was well-plated and came looking like a million bucks.

Infamous frrrozen hot chocolate -- delicious and just as good as I remembered from vising the NY store a few years back.

Pizza - served on a wooden paddle, it looked ginormous when it arrived.  They did a poor job slicing the pizza into manageable pieces.  

Price:
Things seem a bit overprice when you view them on the menu.  $15 for an omelet? However, when you see the portions arrive you soon realize you are actually getting your money's worth.

This hot chocolate is so huge even for two, we could barely finish it. Wonderful presentation and it would be great for a comfortable 4th+ date since you can both sip through the straws and make googly eyes at each other. Aww. 

His root beer float was pretty good, I couldn't taste the alcohol which could have either meant it was a good or bad thing!

My friends and I tried their frozen hot chocolate. Though they were ecstatic to be out of the sun and to drink something cold that isn't soda, water, or frozen daiquiris, I wasn't impress at all. The drink was presented in a glass crystal-like cup topped off with a huge dollop of whipped cream. The frozen hot chocolate was basically ice blended together with hot coco mix, milk, sugar, and shaved chocolate; nothing special at all. 

It's a small place, yet people go crazy over a poorly executed concept, which is a lost to me. Another commercially gimmick for wandering tourists who want relief from the Las Vegas heat, I won't be returning any time soon.",0,0,0

I got the Frrrozen Hot Choco. Why is it over $10? It's not really that different than any other blended mocha that I had... in fact, I think Coffee Bean's is actually richer... The only thing that got the Frrozen Hot Choco going was the delicious whipped cream... that I told myself I would not finish... but ended up finishing anyways.

We made reservations for 9:30 pm to go by for a post-show dessert. When we checked in at 9:30 they said we would need to wait a few more minutes even though there were a number of open tables.

Once we told the waitress that we were just there for dessert it was basically like we didn't exist. She just wanted to be done with us. 

We ordered the snickers sundae. I wish it had tasted 1\/4th as good as it looked. It came with 4 small pieces of what were supposed to be deep fried snickers that just had a really odd taste to them. I wouldn't have guessed that they were snickers at all. 90% of the sundae was just basic vanilla and chocolate ice cream an then topped off with some whipped cream and chocolate sauce. We probably only ate half. Definitely disappointed.

As soon as we sat down we thought we were going to be greeted by a wait staff with menus but we waited for about ten minutes before our not so friendly waitress came over with her sour face and bad attitude.

Beef nachos- huge palm-sized, red, tortilla chips topped with ground beef and layered with cheese. We shared this baby and were both equally stuffed. 

Frrrozen hot chocolate- you HAVE to get this every time you step into Serendipity. It is their signature drink. Topped with whipped cream and shavings of chocolate. When I had their frrrozen hot chocolate, I was expecting it to be more bitter like the one I had in NY, but it turned out to be sweeter. Not to mention, there wasn't much ice to make that crunchy texture. I didn't really like mine, so I left it sitting on the table, whipped cream slowly dissolving into my drink.

Then, got super disappointed.  I went for the take out and not the sit down restaurant.  I'm sure the sit down restaurant presents the frozen hot chocolates a little better than the basic plastic cups we got, but overall my experience was meh.  Definitely a try once kind of thing.  Can't beat the one in New York though.

FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE:  This is what made Serendipity 3 so famous!  It definitely tasted more like a chocolate shake to me here than it did in NYC though. ):

OREO FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE:  I have a limit with how much sweetness I can take, so a few sips of this for me is enough.  If you love oreos and sweets, then this is for you.  Pretty similar to an oreo milkshake.

Ten dollar drinks here!  There are seats available right in front of the take-out window, but they are outside.  It's perfect when the weather is warm, but if it's cold...take it inside!",2,1,1

It really is just wasteful.  But, the food was good.  Not OMG fantastic good but good.  I would go again but split your meal with someone else unless you get something like a salad.  We did order the fried oreo sundae which was really good but I hoped for better chocolate sauce on this.  It tasted like something out of a jar.  But overall still good.

And I was standing right by the host table and I noticed the two hosts were telling literally every party that the wait is 40 min. Lolol.

My party and I had been waiting for 40+ minutes. Half the time in the freezing cold outside cuz they told us to wait outside then the other half inside because it was way too cold and wasn't going to stay outside any longer. Then all of a sudden a party of 2 shows up saying they have reservations at 5pm (Note: it was 4pm). The host picks up 2 menu and seats them right away. This was right after i was told id be seated next. Wth?!?  They made reservation for 5pm... not 4pm. Without hesitation the dumb host didn't think to consider the people who had been waiting and just seated those people. So of course I complained to the other host. And she said yeah I just realized that.. I'll tell her. But yeah nothing could be done because they had already seated them. I was hungry, cold, cranky, and not having it.

Plus the food was not worth it and overpriced but it's vegas so it's expected. But just as people expect vegas to be overpriced simply because it's vegas.. we expect the service to be at least decent because it's vegas. You know?

The only thing I enjoyed was the macchiato  frozen hot chocolate.. 

I will never be going there again unless I was craving their frozen hot chocolate and the wait is 10 min max cuz like I said earlier it's not worth it.

Their management is so unprofessional. The 2 hosts were talking badly about the manager and how he\/she comes in whenever he\/she wants.. I mean that's your opinion and you have the right to say what you want but c'mon... you have customers.. like 15 of them standing in the front waiting to be seated and you're talking badly about your manager? So unprofessional. Hosts are the face of a restaurant.. the first impression and i have to say they were the worst. 

The server was nice but dumb as well. I noticed total reward members receive discount.. so I asked him if I could just give my total rewards # to be used towards the bill and he said he'll get it from it after the meal when he brings me bill. Well.... yeah its my fault I forgot to mention it or remind him when I received the bill but if he's the one that told me he'll do it after.. thenn shouldn't he be responsible for asking for it again when he gives me the bill? I could've saved around $10 but ... nope.

There were oodles of shredded crab, lightly formed into a patty.  Some might dislike the patty falling apart, but I viewed it as a sign that there wasn't much filler to keep it together.  The bread was a little too toasted and slightly oily.  The steak fries were really good - thick and extra crispy.  The skinny sweet potato fries were good but not as crispy.  The food is generous on the fancy Serendipity plates, but nothing great.

The Mochachino frozen hot chocolate was disappointing - all mocha and no chino.  I tried my friend's Oreo frozen hot chocolate, and it was much better, but nothing amazing - an Oreo milkshake in a pretty glass with three straws.

As many have noted, the wait is ridiculous, and the prices are ludicrous - the standard high ""NYC foodie"" base price + the extra ""let's up the price because its Vegas"" surcharge.  Our wait for late Saturday lunch was an hour.  (The wait for Friday lunch looked better.)  After ordering, the food took about thirty minutes.

We wanted to order more food to share but the waiter stopped us and said the portions are huge.  We were glad because when the food came out we were shocked.  The onion ring tower was massive.  It came with BBQ sauce and ranch on the side.  It was perfectly crispy on the outside and super hot and good in the inside.  The nachos were a little disappointing to me.  It contained chips, guac, barely any salsa, sour cream, japalenos, shredded beef and chicken, nacho cheese, and green onions.  Our nachos looked different compared to other people's Yelp nachos photos.  I did not like that all the ingredients were spread out.  For example, the sour cream was a scoop on one side, the chicken was on one side, and the salsa was a small scoop.  Everything was also dried the **** out.  Yes it was big, but quality over quantity.  However, I did like that the tortilla chips were seasoned and flavored.  As, for the frozen hot chocolate, we got their original 16 oz one.  It was the perfect size to share.  It was delicious and we would get it again.  I loved the delicious chocolate flakes on top.  

Our total was about $35.  The portions were HUGE and we had a lot of left overs that we didn't care to take back to our hotel.  I thought the pricing was cheap for the portions.  I think the desserts here are amazing but the food is whatever.  Other items for food on the menu include salads, burgers, hot dogs, pizzas and pastas.  Other dessert items include milk shakes, sundaes, pies and cakes.  Their popular frozen hot chocolate come in many options including peanut butter, mint chocolate, and strawberry.  They also have a brunch menu, kids menu, and full bar.  

The inside of this place is cute but it looks like it needs to be renovated.  The diner\/pink vibe is cute but those hideous colorful lights needs to go.

Wanted to see what the hype was about... Never had frozen hot chocolate nor been to Serendipity for that matter, so it was a must try when I went to Vega$$$. We already ate some Secret Pizza for dinner beforehand, so I wasn't all that hungry. My other two friends had some kind of sandwich (it was HUGE btw) with sunny side up eggs, bacon and some sort of meat in between. They said it had no taste and wasn't good which was surprising to me 'cause I love sunny side up eggs and bacon hahah. We sat at the bar and for some reason our waiter gave us a complimentary order of onion rings. He never really stated why. I assume, extra\/wrong order? But whatevz, it was sooo bomb. Super crispy and flavorful. 

As for the frozen hot chocolate, it was mediocre and kinda tasted like a chocolate shake but not as thick. but it was way too big for me to finish on my own, so I had to share amongst my friends. Don't think I LOVE(d) it, but it was good. But if we had waited an hour for that, I don't think it'd be worth it. Unless I'm actually sitting down to eat as well. The food seems decent. But there's also mixed reviews on them. The vodka ravioli looks yummy. Wonder if that's any good...and the other desserts sounded so yummy as well. Will def come back to try if the wait isn't long. Or else I'll just hit up the take-out window. 

The place is cutesy and the food seems to come in big portions but I'll def have to come back in order to like it more. All the hype kinda killed it for me, imo.

3\/5. Next time around I hope to bump it up to a 4 :o)",3,4,3

The service was great. The atmosphere was fun and quirky and fit the vibe of my wedding night. The food was delicious.  All my guests got full and happy.

We were 5 minutes early, and still ended up having to wait 25 minutes to get seated. So what was the point of reservations right?

Anyhow...since I knew the food would take forever and a day to come out, I started right off with dessert instead - FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE...yummmmm...tasted just as good as when I first had it back in NY. I slurped that thing up within minutes and boy did it satisfy my sweet tooth. The whip cream even hit the spot!

Brunch, however, is something that I would not come back for. Overpriced breakfast\/lunch items that weren't even that tasty. I had the corned beef and potatoes with over easy eggs. I like corn beef hash much better and was actually disappointed when it came out with just the meat itself. Average I must say, nothing to rave about.

The BF had the Fried Egg Benedict...another no-no. Wasn't feeling the gravy sauce, maybe because we were expecting some type of the the usual hollandaise sauce that egg benedicts normally comes with. The fried egg itself was dry and tasteless. It came with two benedicts, but he only ate one...tells you something about the food right?

The service was bad because the blonde bartender just seemed pissed off. She didn't smile just grabbed our menus back when we said we weren't haven't drinks (after glimpsing at the overpriced drink menu).

The food however, left a lot to be desired. My friend had the chicken Cesar salad which for $21 had only three strips of chicken and two gigantic croutons that were impossible to eat. Lettuce looked old and wilted. I had the chicken fingers buffalo style, and although the portion was generous, the wings were so soaked in sauce they were soggy and difficult to enjoy.

We spent our last day in Vegas in the bathroom and laying on random benches because we had already checked out of our hotel and didn't feel well enough to do anything.

Another thing that put me off is that an owner or someone looking to start another location was sitting next to us. The staff was too busy catering to them that the customers were neglected. We arrived and ordered before them but yet they received multiple desserts, appetizers, entrees and cake (of which they would take 1 bite and throw away) before our meal ever arrived. If I was an owner I would want my customers to be well taken care of because that means repeat business.

We had a table outside right along the strip so it was quite a nice view; although, it was still a bit chilly even when they have some outdoor heaters, it wasn't quite warm enough.

I know their frozen hot chocolate is their signature thing, but since I had tried it before at NY and didn't really think it was that special, I decided to pass this time. Instead, I ordered their chocolate french toast and my boyfriend ordered the One and Only Vegas Strip Sandwich. They have two separate menus (brunch and diner) the regular diner menu doesn't begin until 2PM so if you want more of an entree type of food, wait until then

It took awhile for the food to arrive and when it came, I wasn't surprise at the portion of the plates. The sandwich stretched for miles and the french toast was a mountain high. Definitely be cautious of the big portion and plan to share, too much of one plate gets boring. The food was good, I enjoyed my french toast, but it was too much chocolate for me to handle so after a slice and a half. I had to call it quits and packed the rest to go (which I didn't even tried to finish).

The service: not too bad not too good. I mean the waiters didn't wait on us hand and foot the entire time but they were attentive and were helpful when we asked. You can't really expect too much when your restaurant  is packed on a Monday afternoon. 

The food: delicious and not to mention huge portions!
My boyfriend and I shared a regular frozen mint hot chocolate, a foot long chili dog, and a side of onion rings. He also had a small drink but I forgot the exact name of the drink. 
First and most importantly the frozen hot chocolate is a must. The mint flavored one is out of this world. If I had to describe what a frozen hot chocolate is exactly I would say it is a cross between a regular hot chocolate and a chocolate shake. It was very light, creamy, and pretty much the best thing I have had since I discovered ice cream!
The foot long hot dog was HUGE! The pictures do not do it justice. My boyfriend and I spilt the hotdog and we were full till way past dinner time. While the hotdog itself and the chili was nothing too out of this world it was an interesting eat due to the fact the dog was served on a French loaf rather than a traditional hotdog bun. 
The onion rings were delicious. They were perfectly friend and crispy. The side portion came with about 4-6 small onion rings which was a perfect size for us.

When I first tried this place back in March, I had a VERY good first impression-- the ambiance, the food, and most of all, the service made me leave this restaurant as one happy customer.

I went at around 5 or 6pm on a Friday night. My two cousins and I were seated the moment we stepped into the place. Our waiter was very friendly and didn't take too long to bring us our drinks and take our order. We ordered the Crab & Artichoke Dip, a High Heel Pump for my cousin and I to share, and a Full Monty for my other cousin.

Although it did take a while for them to serve us our orders (about 20-25 min), it was all worth it. Our appetizer and our 2 sandwiches arrived at the same time.

Our order did get a little messed up-- Instead of my cousin and I getting the High Heel Pump, they gave us another Full Monty by mistake. We told the waiter that we received the wrong order. He walked to the cooks and discussed the error with them, came right back to us and said that if we'd like to keep the Full Monty that they made for us, then he would take it out of our tab. :-) DEAL! We said YES with no hesitation. I mean, who WOULDN'T take a free sandwich?!

The sandwich was flavorful and filling. As I was eating it, I kept telling myself that it was the BEST sandwich I've ever tasted (probably because the thought of it being free made it 10x better). ;-)

The Crab & Artichoke dip was tasty. It was full of crab meat rather than the actual mayo dip mix, which is a plus. Since we couldn't finish it all, we took the rest of the dip back to our hotel-- I had some for breakfast the morning after (with some bread and crackers we kept in the room), and it still tasted good. Next time I go there, I'll probably order this again, but as my meal instead of an appetizer.

For dessert, we ordered their infamous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. Before we ordered it, we asked our waiter if it was okay for us to use a Frrrozen Hot Chocolate coupon that we got from PH. He told us that our coupon wouldn't be valid unless we ordered more than a certain amount, but said that he'll try to work it out for us. At this moment, I was very happy with our waiter and his great service (although I wish I remembered his name)!

The Frrrozen Hot Chocolate was not too sweet and not too thick. It had a light consistency, which didn't make us too full. I would compare it to a soft, smooth chocolate milkshake. 

Once we received our tab, our Frrrozen Hot Chocolate ended up being FREE! Which meant, 2 free orders in one night! HELL YEAH. Our total was around $35. Rare for me to say this, but our waiter definitely deserved that very generous tip we gave him. :-)",0,0,0

First, the staff was unfriendly and rude(the hostess in particular, in fact I noticed that about a lot of the other places this time). Upon arrival we requested our table for 10   Four adults and 6 children... They wanted to separate tables or charge the minimum 20% gratuity(which was fine), but we wanted to sit together. They separated us while having two tables side by side by the same waiter. I was disappointed at this time already. 
Secondly, we sat at our table for a good ten minutes before even getting water brought to us. 
Third, the waiter seemed to no interest in answering questions about the menus. He address with such answers: "" u don't know what type of food you like"", ""if you like burgers"" I almost felt like had revisited DICKS LAST RESORT..... 
Further, the food was your average cafe food priced as American bistro... Lame! 
Finally, the only appealing thing seemed to be their sweets menu--- it was exactly that.... Too sweet, I also thought that the ""frozen hot chocolate"" was a contradictory term, for which I disliked the place even more. Don't try to sell me on the idea of a frozen hot chocolate.

So like some of my friends reviews would say, it IS a bit hyped up AND pricey for a Chocolate shake. However, I think its not too terrible. To me, a milkshake is thick, rich and creamy. However, this didn't have the texture of a traditional milkshake so its not quite the same. I had the Peanut Butter Frozen Hot Chocolate. I thought it was really good but was it worth the 13 bucks? Maybe its more worth 8 bucks in my opinion.

I would definitely recommend my friends to check it out but I wouldn't hype it up for them because when something is hyped, we create this huge expectation that it should be fabulous.

We waited a good 45 minutes to be seated and for 3 of my friends to share a small chip appetizer and having a shake to ourselves each, we spent about $22 each including the gratuity and for the wait and price, I didn't think it was quite worth it...but worth it in a sense to try something new and different and ""hyped"" about, one should check it out.",0,0,0

Located just off Las Vegas Blvd, right in front of Caesar's Palace, Serendipity offers an extensive menu comprised from delightful variations of traditional American dishes and desserts.  

The décor transmits a retro odds and ends type of style, channeling themes of Alice in Wonderland & Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.

After walking up and down the strip under the blistering desert sun I was parched and in dire need of something refreshing. I took a quick gander at the mobile yelp app and I decided to check out Serendipity's infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate. 

I was quickly seated during the early afternoon (2pm Wednesday). My friend and I decided to share a Frozen Hot Chocolate for Two. We also desired something piquant that would enhance the sweetness of the chocolate, so we happily ordered a side of Sweet Potato Fries.   

The food was magnificent, simple and very delicious. The Frozen Hot Chocolate is essentially Nestlé's instant hot chocolate dry mix blended with ice and garnished with whip cream & bits of chocolate. For whatever reason I was anticipating a malty texture similar to a milk shake, boy was I wrong. The texture is something like a slush, very icy and rich, drinking it does not require much effort. (very sweet) 

The chocolate and sweet potato fries complimented each other perfectly. (Something salty with something sweet). Maybe a little bit more salty than I would have liked, but still very delicious. 

Since we did not order anything too elaborate (due to the mixed yelp reviews) I glanced around the room to see what the other patrons had ordered. I noticed tea tray towers filled with dishes such as sandwiches and various types of finger foods, also very charming tableware brandishing the Serendipity name which occupied savory looking salads, pizzas, burgers, sundaes, ribs, cakes, deep fried oreos and everything else that screams America.  

All in all I had a really good experience here. This is definitely a cute place to come with your girlfriend or your wife & kids. I loved it I was in good company and it kept me out of the sun. 

Word of advice order a water.. you will need it! 

Your average dish here is between $10-$20
Any dessert (preferably ice cream) can be topped with a selection of candies, nuts, and sauces for an additional $1\/each.

I was in Vegas on vacation and was excited to try the Nevada version of my favorite restaurant.  My friend and I got there and waited about 30 minutes to be seated.  Not too bad considering I once waited 2 hours for a table in NYC.  We looked at the menu and were ready to order, but unfortunately, no waitress showed up for at least 20-25 minutes.  Once the expression on my face showed I was slightly annoyed, a waitress came over and asked if we were being helped.  We weren't.  Strike one.

We had a coupon for a free Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, one of my favorite treats.  Well....they brought it out and the first thing I noticed was that they did not use fresh whipped cream, it was Reddi-Wip.  Also, it was a much smaller portion than Serendipity in New York.  The Frrrozen Hot Chocolate wasn't made correctly..very watery.  We didn't really drink it.  Strike two.

The food was alright.  I won't give them any strikes for that.  I enjoyed my grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup.  

We ordered our favorite New York desserts and again were slightly disappointed.   I ordered the Coward's Portion Banana Split and the lady was in such a hurry, I didn't get to tell her which ice cream and toppings I wanted.  The original location always asks me if I want to customize.  Strike three. 

Overall, the Las Vegas location is OKAY.  It's not terrible, but if you LOVE Serendipity 3 in New York, I wouldn't recommend it.  You'll just be disappointed.  If you have never eaten at the original Serendipity 3, I'd say go for it!  You probably won't know the difference and you'll have a good meal.  Unfortunately, I found myself comparing the two locations the entire night.  Again, it might be unfair to do so, but I simply don't believe this location lives up to that famous Serendipity 3 name.",4,1,1

After hearing all the hype about the frozen hot chocolate here I just had to try it. We had the original flavor, oreo, and strawberry. I have to say the original frozen hot chocolate tasted the best!

It's 10$ for a small cup which is pretty pricy but it was alright for the novlety of it. They have outdoor seating and everything is sherbet  colored so it was a nice place to chill and rest. 

I'd say the frozen hot chocolate tastes like a hot chocolate powder milkshake. The oreo flavor tastes more like the creme insides than the cookie and the strawberry tastes kind of like a powdery strawberry milkshake.

So after waiting in that line...( btw i was already aggravated at the indecisive customer before me... sorry but if you are r going to wait in line for 10 minutes... you should know what you want by the time you get to the window) I decided to order the Vegas dog (why not... we are in Vegas and I love jalapeños)  and of course a frozen hot chocolate.

The wait for seating in the restaurant is pretty bad, but the nice thing is that you can put your name down and they text you when your table is ready.  This enables you to go walk around inside Cesar's palace and explore and play while waiting.  This also enabled me to grab a few drinks at their ""to-go"" counter at the front.  They ran out of whatever they use to make smoothies--and whenever someplace can't get a handle on their inventory I dock stars.  I got the hot chocolate and it was pretty good and filled me up enough to last until we were called for brunch.

Service is SO slow here, which is definitely a downer when you've been waiting so long for your table in the first place.  I could have sworn there was only one server in charge of the whole patio area on Sunday brunch.

I got the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs and my boyfriend got the Crab Cake Benedict.  I really liked the corned beef hash, because you could tell they had cured and prepared the meat themselves so it was definitely fresh. The Crab Cake Benedict was also very good, but was a smaller portion compared to everything else and much higher priced--but I guess that should be expected for seafood during brunch.

HOLIDAY - 4 stars 
   They don't seem as full as other restaurants in New Year's Eve. Wait and price wasn't as bad. Hostess wasn't as nice, and got seated by the door inside. Since we're inside and by the door, every time somebody opens the door, you get really cold. A few tables opened up. I went to the hostesses inside, and they ignored me for a good 3 minutes because they were busy gossiping. After I finally got their attention, they said they can't transfer me to another table once I'm already seated. Even though I was annoyed by the impoliteness of the hostesses inside and outside, I tried to go on with my dinner. 
   Our server (White male) was nice, and gave some recommendations on how to eat our meal. Another server (Asian male) was also nice enough to talk to us and gave recommendations. The food is off the New Year's Eve menu so it is not regularly served there. Their bacon gruyere Mac cheese sticks is awesome, but the onion rings with it is sub par. I had the seafood risotto, which was excellent; I was bummed I didn't finish it because I was too full. My boyfriend's prime rib was juicy and tender. We were too full for sundae so we got the molten chocolate cake, which was delicious. Boyfriend and I were both happy. NYE meal came up to $100 excluding tip. 

REGULAR DAY - 1 star
   I went here again because I was bummed that I was too full to try their famous Can't Say No Sundae, which is not available in their take-out section. I made reservations via OpenTable\/Yelp. I got there on time, and I was told to wait. The hostess was impolite and dressed like she's going to workout. I am surprised because that's the first time I was asked to wait when I have a reservation. After 10 minutes of waiting, she had me sit outside. I thought I would get priority of getting seated inside since I made a reservation. I also thought their heater is on since it's getting cold already but it wasn't on. The server was ok, but I didn't like how the server and the hostess fought in front of us because the hostess is having a big party sit in a table the hostess is not done fixing yet. I thought the table is clean; it just needs utensils. Why don't the hostess get it since all she does is stand and look like a snob dressed in sweats anyway. The server was not also being professional in sort of shouting at the hostess. She should've pulled her aside, and talked to her; not announce to all the customers that they're a mess. Ok, so service is bad on regular days. Got it. 
   So the food finally came after waiting too long. The CRAB ARTICHOKE DIP is not good; I forced myself to eat it since I'm hungry and we paid $13 for it. My boyfriend's LAS VEGAS PHILLY CHEESE STEAK SANDWICH ($22) was delicious; hence, my 1 star. Then after a while, we had the CAN'T SAY NO SUNDAE. It's not as awesome as the hype goes. It tastes like regular drugstore sundae. The cake in it was not as good; tastes like cake you'd get in the grocery store. The ice cream itself is just regular ice cream. I would've been better off getting gelato. I was disappointed. 
   Even if I live in Vegas, I won't go out of my way now just to eat here, considering there's a ton of places to eat here.

I was starving and it was literally one of the first places besides Margaritaville that I saw. It was way too early, at 11:30am, for margaritas (although I know it's Vegas--I had my share the night before), so we went to Serendipity. It looked cute and I thought they were serving brunch (it was Friday). 

Anyway, we go in and the front is packed, but when we came through the back way there seemed to be a ton of seating available. We were told that the wait would be 30 to 40 minutes. We decided to wait. Anywho, about an hour later we were pretty annoyed so we went inside to check our status. We were told we were coming up next, yet about four other parties or so were seated ahead of us. We basically waited another 20 minutes. At this point I'm beyond annoyed (did I mention it was my 30 bday and I was nursing a slight headache so the fact that I had no food was turning me into a beast?). We are finally seated and it takes a little while to order our food, and then forever to get it. Turns out that they didn't have brunch so I had to order from the lunch menu. 

I ordered a burger that had avocado and caramelized onions. I think it might have had some cheese on it as well...this immediately tells you how I felt about the burger. It was so tasteless and forgettable. I mean, I tried to put salt on it to bring out some flavor and it just went nowhere.

We wanted a place somewhere around 25-30 a plate so that we knew it'd be good food but still affordable. We had a reservation for 9 which means that each person had to spend a minimum of $25 dollars as well as a mandatory 18% gratuity added to the bill. We get there and have to wait an hour to be seated. We told them it was our 5 year anniversary and wanted it to be special. I guess special to them is a small table with 9 seats around it right by the front door when they have parties of about 4 taking up giant booths. Anyways, I finally order and get their $23 fried chicken meal - it was worse than literally a fried chicken made in a TV dinner.

We mostly come here for the frozen hot chocolate, which is a steal if you check in on foursquare - free frozen hot chocolate with any purchase of $10!  So last time, we decided that our $10 purchase would be a cheesecake - I know, a $12 cheesecake?? We were pretty skeptical too, but we really weren't in the mood for much else. So lo and behold, our cheesecake comes out, and it is LITERALLY the HUGEST cheesecake I have ever seen. It could feed a family of 6. At least. There were 3 of us that day and we took over half of it home. And cheesecake is my forte too.  It was seriously incredible, I still rave about it. Not just for its size either.  The cheesecake itself was a lighter\/fluffier consistency than most, which normally would bother me, but it made it much more doable to eat a LOT of it. It also wasn't too sweet, which was perfect for me. The crust is a mac nut crust and though I prefer graham crackers, the nuts were pretty good too.  Like I said though, expect to be taking most of it home or back to your hotel (:

When I requested to be reseated, the management promised me that they'd move us as soon as 5 more seats became available, yet we watched as walk-ups were continually seated instead. 

While the food was indeed great, it was hard to appreciate as no one was in the mood for eating in that uncomfortable heat. More than half the food and drink ordered went unconsumed.

- ABC (Avocado, Brie, Caramalized Onions) Burger
- Frozen Hot Chocolate

I don't remember why this place was famous, but supposedly it's in a movie or something and the original one is in New York. The decor is really girly and circus-like. Our party decided to sit outside, but that was probably a wrong move because it was hella windy. Luckily they had some heaters on, so that made it somewhat better. 

Our waitress was alright. She didn't seem very personable or present. She was barely around, and there weren't even a lot of customers outside. However this other guy with curly hair was also waiting tables nearby, and eventually helped us whenever we needed something. Thank you curly hair man. The supervisor or whoever that blond lady was, seemed really angry and mean. Please take that negativity behind the doors and away from the customers. I hate hearing employees getting scolded right next to any customer in a restaurant... it makes things so awkward.

Now for the food! The ABC Burger was pretty damn good. It was kinda hard to bite because it was stacked up high. It was kind of small, but enough for me. The burger came with these awesome sweet potato fries. My definite favorite. I asked for some honey mustard, which made it even more bomb. The meat was cooked correctly and was full of flavor. For dessert, I got the frozen hot chocolate which was alright. Nothing out of this world. 

Would I come here again? Probably, just because it's Vegas and those sweet potato fries are always a win for me. Too bad the menu is overpriced!",5,4,5

Sweet, the wait was going to be nonexistent....NOT. The wait turned out to be 35-40 minutes. Why they refuse to seat people when they have plenty of open tables is beyond me!  I asked the snooty hostess why this was so and she said that it was the top of the hour so they had to seat everyone who was already on the list...that didn't even make sense. If there are open tables, shouldn't you seat guests?? The hostesses proceeded to seat two other groups before us in a span of 20 minutes...really?!

When we were finally shown to one of the many open tables we took a quick glance at the menu and chose the sliders and a regular frozen hot chocolate for two. We closed our menus and waited for our waitress to come around, which probably seemed longer than it actually was due to the heat. She unpleasantly took our order then came out 5 minutes later and abruptly placed dishes on our table without saying a word to us. She must hate her job...

We asked to sit outside along the strip and were told there was a 10-15 minute wait.  We ventured outside to wait at the bar and noticed at least 5 tables with no occupants which still had people's used plates, glasses and leftover food sitting out.  The floor had garbage underneath nearly every table and there was dirt smudges all over the black and white checkered floor.  We decided to wait inside, which was also not clean.  My boyfriend made a good point, which was if the restaurant was this dirty, what did the kitchen look like?  If I'd been at home, we would have left, but I really wanted to try the Frrrozen hot chocolate!

We waited close to 10 minutes and were then seated at a table outside.  It looked like ours and another table had been cleaned but there were no silverware settings.  The other 3 tables near us were still covered in unwanted food remnants.  Our table was next to the trash can\/service area and two old chairs, one of which had a cigarette burn all the way through the cushion.  Charming.

The Frrrozen hot chocolate is billed as a blend of 20 different kinds of chocolate in ""an icy cocoa concoction.""  I ordered the regular size as well as three deep fried oreos.  Oreos are not listed on the menu individually, but our server advised I could order them at $1.50 each.  We also asked for waters which I had observed on each table with huge blue and pink straws.  Not too long after, my hot chocolate and oreos arrived.  Still had no water and no silverware.  I asked the server for water again.  If you see my photo of the hot chocolate, it had clearly been sitting in the kitchen for a little while, as it was presented to me with part of the drink melted in the plate below.  A well-attended kitchen would have been sure to switch out the plate before presenting this $12 drink to a customer.  Further, you can see that only half of the glass contains the actual hot chocolate.  The rest is filled with whipped cream.

The frrrozen hot chocolate was tasty, but I did not detect even a hint of there being 20 different kinds of chocolate, and I find that claim somewhat suspect.  It did not take long to finish the chocolate part of the drink, which was disappointing, given I had almost an entire glass of whipped cream remaining.  The oreos were battered in corn flakes, which I had never seen before.  Not the prettiest presentation, but they were tasty.  I finally got my water and napkins close to the time I was finishing my food.  Surprisingly, my server told me at that time that my oreos were on the house.  

Overall, I would say to skip Serendipity 3 on your Las Vegas visit.  It clearly is not well-managed and its servers are not set up to succeed.  I saw a group of women at another table complaining to the manager about waiting over an hour for their food.  He didn't really seem to care, at least from my vantage point.  Gone is the Serendipity 3 you may have seen featured on tv as I did, which seemed to show a well-kept, high end dessert shop.

Couldn't stop by without an order of the frozen hot chocolate. Yummm. On a hot day outside, it certainly hit the spot. It wasn't too sweet and it was frosty enough but not too much to be the same as ice cream. And this was just the starter. 

My Central Park Omelet came with egg whites, spinach, and avocado with a side of potatoes. You'd think it's the same potatoes you get with other breakfast entrees...you know, the kind that you slather on tons of ketchup because it'd be bland otherwise. But nooo, not these potatoes. These were crisp like chicken nuggets and had seasoning, so it was yummy by itself. Pair that with a bite of the omelet and I was on my way to food coma. 

But wait! You can't leave Serendipity without an order of their ice cream sundae. They all looked good, but I settled on the deep fried Oreo and cream sundae. Five deep fried Oreos sitting on a mountain of cookies and cream ice cream, whipped cream, marshmallow fluff, more bits of normal Oreos, with a cherry on top. OMG, so much sugar. The deep fried Oreos are enough to do you in. By this point, water refills were a life saver. Sadly, I couldn't finish the sundae after having two deep fried Oreos and a lot of spoonful of the ice cream, but I would not hesitate to return to try some of the other less decadent sundaes.

I've walked by this Vegas location many times.  It's located street corner at Caesar's hotel and casino.  This time we stopped with our friends and went inside the restaurant. I wanted them to try the famous frozen hot chocolate.

Hubby and I shared the 8oz serving.  They also offer the 16oz serving as in NYC.   And we got the nachos appetizer for the four of us to share.

And it's a good thing too.   The nachos were enough for four and more.

The only disappointment this time was sharing the 8oz frozen hot chocolate with hubby.  I took small sips while he took huge slurps.  When I looked up, he almost finished the whole thing.  Needless to say I thought about the frozen hot chocolate and complained the rest of the day.  Too bad I can't Yelp about hubby's slurping.

I said we shoulda gotten the 16oz instead.  Next time.

* The Big Chili
* S3 Chopped Chicken Salad


The only thing ""big"" about this chili was the price! For $10 I was expecting a bowl of chili that would satisfy even a child's appetite. What came out was a shallow saucer with maybe 1  1\/2 cup of chili and a huge glob of sour cream on top. Also to my disappointment, there was no cornbread! Serving chili with no cornbread is like getting a bowl of milk with no cereal...  The one thing I can say about this chili was that it was flavored well. The richness of the seasonings really came through and wasn't masked behind the ground beef and kidney beans.

After a scorching afternoon in the Vegas sun, I was in the mood for something cool, refreshing and even a little healthier. Enter the Serendipity 3 Chopped Chicken Salad. If I could sum up this salad in one word, it would be: forgettable. Putting price aside ($16) what was presented was some chopped romaine lettuce mixed with some tomatoes, cucumbers and frozen chicken breast chunks tossed in ranch. The tomatoes did seem fresh, but the chicken breast was definitely of the frozen variety in which you could find at your local Coscto. I am still wondering how anyone could justify charging $16 dollars for this kind of salad.

My Complaint

 It is not unusual to have people in a large party order various things off the menu as their main dish - appetizers, entrées, soups, salads etc. We had a few people order soup with a side salad as their meal and even a person who ordered a sundae as his meal! With that said, its not unreasonable to expect that everyone's order come out together so everyone can eat at the same time. I guess that expectation was too much for the staff at S3. One person got her soup before anything else came out... finished it, and then got her salad after while everyone else was still waiting for their food! Another friend ordered the Dinosaur Beef Ribs with a side of steamed broccoli. They're steamer must have been out-of-order because she didn't get her steamed broccoli until she was half way done with her ribs! Not only did everyone's food come out at different times, sides of an entrée even  came out separately! I generally try to write positive reviews and tend to post on places I feel other people would enjoy. However, wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't share the horrible service at S3.",0,0,0

 so kann man das Serendipity am besten beschreiben. Obwohl  es gibt nicht nur Burger, die große Menukarte ist umfangreich und bietet auch jede Menge Pizzen, Omelets und andere Eiergerichte, dazu verführerische, große Desserts  Eis, Cremes und sonstige Naschereien.
Im Innenraum sind die Tische sehr eng gestellt, zu Essenszeiten ist es meist gerammelt voll und Gesprächsführung kaum noch möglich. Schöner ist es da schon auf der Außenterrasse. Der Blick auf den direkt vor einem liegenden Strip ist lebendiges Kino. Und mit einem guten Teleobjektiv lassen sich von hier aus unbemerkt die kuriosesten Fotos schießen. 
Für Las Vegas Verhältnisse lässt es sich preislich vernünftig essen. Wir waren mehrfach hier und haben  natürlich, wenn schon dann schon  Burger getestet: A.B.C. Burger ($ 16+), BBQ & Blue Burger ($ 16+), B.E.C. Burger ($ 17+), aber auch ein Omelet East West ($ 14+). Wir bestellten die Burger medium rare und erfuhren, dass dies hier pink genant wird. Die aus Süßkartoffeln hergestellten Pommes gibt es zum Burger dazu und schmecken vorzüglich. Soft Drinks heißen in den Staaten Sodas (Cokes, Fantas etc.) kosten $ 4. Und den Pott Kaffee bekommt man für $ 4, freies Nachschenken inklusive.
Zu Spitzenzeiten ist das Restaurant sehr gut besucht und man muss Wartezeiten bis zu 45 Minuten hinnehmen. Die Bedienung wie immer freundlich, aber bei vollem Lokal überfordert. Häufiges Warten ist leider angesagt, auf die Bestellannahme, auf die Lieferung des Bestellten und auch auf die Rechnung, die doch sonst in den Staaten immer so schnell auf den Tisch gelegt wird. 
Fazit: Zentral gelegene, preislich vernünftige Futterstelle. Wer Zeit mitbringt und diese Art Küche mag, der wird zufrieden sein. Gratis gibt es von der Terrasse das Las Vegas Spektakel. Gute drei Sterne.",0,0,0

Save some time (we all know how precious that is in Vegas) and order the Frrrozen Hot Choco or any of their Sin City frozen drinks (Raspberry truffle!) to further that buzz from their to-go window instead of waiting a ridiculously long time for seats. It's only worth the wait if seated on the patio overlooking Las Vegas Blvd. Drunk people watching is the bees knees on the Strip! :) But service has been blah the two times I have dined here.

Ordered the peanut butter frozen hot chocolate, and added peanut butter cups for an extra dollar...it was amazing!! Even better than the original! Shared the regular sized with 2 other friends and it was the perfect amount without feeling terribly guilty after eating your meal.

Also ordered the crab cake sandwich with sweet potato fries which was great! The crab cake wasn't too fishy, and the brioche bun was really nice and dense. It was just kind of hard to eat because it would fall apart...still it is worth the trouble.

First of all - this place is always crowded. Yes, there's a little ""to-go"" line outside, but to be honest, that's usually crowded as well. To save a little time, we opted to sit outside in the 110 degree Vegas weather on their little patio area. For some reason, they did not have the fans on, which was unfortunate right from the start.

The service was ridiculously slow, even for them being busy. Not having water when it's that hot outside is such a bummer and experience killer. 

But...some optimisim. The Frozen Hot Chocolate (which, let's be real, is the only real reason to go here in the first place) was pretty much everything I wanted it to be. Boyfriend and I got away with sharing one of the smaller sizes (not the ""for two"" size, but the ""for one"" size, which was still pretty big and a little more budget friendly). Totally great. Totally worth a try. Sort of worth the other little annoyances. Definitely worth a visit to one of the Serendipity locations, but if I were you...I would take my chances at one of the other ones.",4,3,4

Food
- BBQ Chicken Sandwich - very flavorful and the chicken wasn't dry. I liked it a lot
- Onion rings - sooo bad. The batter was way too thick and they dunked it in parmesan. Gross...
- steak fries - seasoned with kosher salt. and was very good! 
- sweet potato fries - a little bland, but not bad. 
- Frozen Hot Chocolate - this was hyped up way too much for me. I could do without.

The atmosphere was nice as it had this diner-type vibe.  As busy as they were, we were still seated right away.  For those that want take out... they also have windows that you can order from on the side.

The service was great!  Our waitress was very friendly.  She took the time to go over the menu with us when we asked for a recommendation.  And when we ordered our food... we ordered something on the side, but when it arrived it wasn't exactly how we asked.  She took notice and immediately made the change before we could say anything.

The food was great and the portions were definitely filling.  We even had enough to take back to the hotel for a later snack.  We had the rock shrimp appetizer (can't go wrong with shrimp) and ordered a single chili cheese dog to share.  This thing was no regular sized hot dog in a regular sized bun.  It was pretty big... (that's what she said).  But really... this chili dog with a side of fries definitely does the job.  Let's not get too carried away on the portions 'cause what good is a lot of food if it tastes like crap?  No worries here.  It was definitely good.  Toward the end of our meal we had the frrrozen hot chocolate (for free, courtesy of The Flamingo).  Imagine a ""hot"" chocolate on ice, with whipped cream and sprinkled bits of chocolate, topped with a bit of awesomeness.  If this drink isn't slap-you-in-the-face good, I will gladly do it for you.

First of all, their famous frozen hot chocolate is extremely overrated. There's too many little bits of ice in every sip for me to find it enjoyable.

I'd say that a Starbucks frappaccino would be just as satisfying and would cost you less. 

If you want to sit down for a meal, the layout is confusing. If you enter from the side entrance from the strip, there's no hostess to greet you. You have to exit through the back to the side that the takeout window and Caesar's is on to put your name down for a table. 

I ordered a hotdog here and there really isn't much to say about it. It wasn't awful but it wasn't great. The best part of the meal was the waffle cut fries and the sweet potato fries.

Take my advice serendipity 3 executives
And chef.. Simplify your menu and hire a whole new kitchen crew in addition to the one you already have.. It shouldn't take so long for food to arrive on each table.. People are paying and when they pay they demand and you unfortunately don't supply. Just because you're busy and have a bunch of people coming in through ur doors everyday doesn't mean you don't need to change..

Ok on to the food.  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs thinking that it's pretty complicated to mess something as simple but I was wrong.  The sauce was bland and the meatballs had no flavor at all either.  Not to mention they don't even serve it with a piece of garlic bread.  Instead a cold piece of regular white bread that was probably sitting out for a while.  The noodles were some kind of fat version of spaghetti noodle which was kind of odd.  

My date had their cheeseburger which I don't know how they could mess up but they still managed to.  She ordered it medium but it came out more like well done and left there for a couple minutes extra.  The outside was burnt and crispy and the juiciness of the burger was lacking.  At least the French Fries were good though.

On to the dessert.  We ordered the deep fried Oreos with cookies and cream ice cream.  It looked a lot better than it tasted.  When I think deep fried Oreos I think of cake batter on the outsides but they used corn flakes which made it taste awful.

This weekend I finally got the chance to see what all the hype was about. I was crunched for time, so I didn't dine in but opted to go to their ""express"" window, which was still a pretty long wait. I guess this place is popular, indoors and out.

During the long wait, I started getting hungry--and their snacks started to seem more and more appetizing. After careful scrutiny, I decided to order the Frozen Hot Chocolate (their signature beverage) and a Jalapeno Cheddar Bacon Pretzel.

One was awesome, the other was not. The Frozen Hot Chocolate was very sweet and definitely refreshing, a nice way to cool off from the scorching Vegas heat.  Don't expect it to quench your thirst though, because it's more of a cool dessert than it is a drink.

Jalapeno Cheddar Bacon Pretzel was entirely forgettable. This thing was humungous--over 1 foot in length, curved into an ""S"" shape. But it was not fresh, not hot, not tasty, and extremely salty. Overall just a bad pretzel.

But a bad pretzel is not enough to make me completely avoid this place forever--I'll give this joint another chance. Maybe next time I'll actually dine in: their list of desserts sure did look appetizing...",1,1,0

Our wait was only about 10 minutes to sit out on the patio. Perfect weather the day we went so it was really nice sitting outside. The patio is RIGHT ON THE STRIP so you get a really nice view. 

My friends and I came strictly for dessert. We ordered the fried oreos which comes with about 6 pieces of deep fried oreos, vanilla and cookies n cream ice cream, whipped cream, chocoate and a cherry on top. I'm not a huge fan of oreos but my friends said it was reallly gooood!! i enjoyed the just the ice cream. I'm not sure where they get their ice cream from but their vanilla ice cream was AMAZING! i would be satisfied with just getting a regular chocolate sundae from this place! but the dessert portions are HUGE!! 

We also ordered their famous frozen hot chocolate. This thing was HUGE!! Definately enough for 3 people to finish. It was very sweet. maybe a little too sweeet. More on the icy side than the creamy side though. My friends enjoyed the fried oreos and ice cream better than the frozen hot chocolate. I enjoyd both but im just a huge chocolate fan so im a bit biased (:  I would DEFINATELY come back here for some more dessert!! 

The inside is very cute. Guys testosterone levels might go down just a tad bit tho (;  haha..its very girly inside but like i said, cute. They have a little souvenir stand where you can buy shirts and accessories too. 

I had a great time here! i'm definately stopping by here everytime i take a trip over to vegas! hopefully i'll be able to try the food here next time too. The chicken wings loooked reallly goood! wasn't all covered with sauce. I'm excited to go and try it (:

I DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD OTHER LOCATIONS BESIDES NEW YORK!!!"" After watching the movie, Serendipity, with Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack, I've been obsessed with wanted to go to that place, and always assumed that it was only in New York. 

I was able to get that Serendipity-fix taken care of during a quick vacation in Las Vegas. Don't come here and expect to get a table right away, this place is constantly PACKED. Our party of 6 had a 40-minute wait before we got seated. So if you're a hungry-beast, don't go here. 

Not only that, their service is S-L-O-W. Took at least 20-30 minutes before we got our appetizers and another 20-30 minutes for the main meal. So if you're not a patient person AND you're a hungry-beast, don't go here. 

But the appetizers that we got were DELICIOUS. Crabcake & artichoke dip was so different, yet good, and the beef sliders were quite tasty too. I got the vodka-based pasta as my entree which was mehh, the boyfriend got a giant-sized steak sandwich that he couldn't finish, but enjoyed, and my friends got some melt-in-your-mouth delicious crab cake sandwiches. To sum it up? Anything with crab on this menu is probably ridiculously good. 

Also, if you have foursquare on your phone and you check into Caesar's Palace, you can get a coupon for a free frozen hot chocolate with a $10 purchase. You have to go the Rewards Center (in the Forum Shops) to redeem the coupon though, but if you have the time, go! It'll save you $11 on a frozen hot chocolate!!! They're tricky though, it only applies to ONE table even if that ONE table has MULTIPLE tabs.

My friend said to try the FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE and it was out of this world!  It's made from 20 different types of chocolate and comes with whipped cream. IT WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD!  The waitress said that they want people to order it first so that they can enjoy it fully on an empty stomach and it can also be your drink to compliment your meal. You have a choice of a single or cup that serves two. It costs $10 for the single and $14 for the double.  The single cup was huge for one person but soo good I wouldnt recommend sharing! lol

I had the HANGOVER OMELET which was decent but the upside is that it's the hugest OMELET EVER! It had bacon, fries, cheese and the waitress told me they use a total of 8 eggs for each omelet! TALK ABOUT FATTY! It also came with a choice of steak or sweet potatoe fries.  WAY TOO MUCH CARBS especially with fries already in the omelet. The price was a little high for an omelet but you definately get the biggest portion I've ever seen. IT WAS HUGE TWSS!

My uncle got their hot chocolate mocha cappicino which came in a huge coffee cup. The waitress was really nice, she forgot about it and didnt charge us once we reminded her.

The downs of this place is that in the winter it's way too cold to eat outside even with their heaters (which are super weak by the way).  If you're there when its cold, wait a few minutes and be seated inside.  Although the patio area over looks las vegas BLVD and had a great ambiance!  The prices are a little too much for the meals they offer and theyre not the best.  I give the FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE 5 stars though!

I've been here previously for lunch and knew I didn't want to go back, but I went here for dinner recently to oblige my pregnant cousin who really wanted to try the frozen hot chocolate. To me, frozen hot chocolate just means it must be similar to milkshake, so I've never had the urge to have it. Some positive things - they accepted my Total Rewards card for a minor discount on some items. Negative things - during my Open Table reservation, I noted we were celebrating a birthday, a pregnancy and a graduation - none of which were acknowledged in the slightest during our stay. Night of our reservation, I was also trying to call ahead to let them know we'd be late coming from the Mirage, but there was no answer at all and I had let it ring for a long time. My sister, who has high blood pressure due to her love of everything fatty and salty (she puts mayo on everything), thought the burger we ordered was overly salty. She was right, there were huge balls of salt within the patty. My pregnancy cousin asked the runner who delivered her food for ranch, and he just walked away without looking at her and said they just ran out of ranch. A few seconds later, I asked the runner who delivered my food for ranch, and he brought it to me quickly. My cousins ended up being underwhelmed by the frozen hot chocolate. We had ordered 2 for the table, both of which went unfinished. This place is one of the least romantic places you can be in if you are spending a weekend in Las Vegas. Staff works hard and they get so busy handling tourists, but you are much better off going somewhere else. Annoying bachelorette parties should all come here though - they can free up space in the nicer restaurants :D",4,4,2

Be sure to get a sundae to split with at least 2 people. We got one made with peanut butter, hot fudge, humble pie, and coffee flavored ice cream, and it was great but so sweet we left 75% in the bowl. There were three of us who couldn't handle the sundae.. it was that big.",1,1,1

The layout of the restaurant should have been better to accommodate size and demands of tourists and visitors instead of only being able to service the basic size of a mom & pop shop. It has a great area for outdoor seating but the shade and covering or cooling was not enough for Nevada 104+ F demands. The host and service was NOT great at all and good luck trying to find a seat and service with a party greater than 3. We were forced to wait an hour and a half in 104 F when we just had to give up because although we confronted the host as to why several parties were being let in (parties of 1 & 2), our party of 5 is just too big for them and it's easier to let people with smaller parties in. So very rude and not worth the wait.

My highest recommendations to you, if you're willing to pay the same amount for Serendipity 3 go inside Caesars with A\/C and comfy seating and shade. Find a bakery called Payard's Patisserie and get their drinks and pastries, just the same price (perhaps portions are smaller regarding pastries but they are in French style-size, drinks are huge) and BONUS they give free samples.

When she did silver the food she was looking at another table and switched our orders.

2. The ice cream was mediocre. Nothing special really. Yes, large portions and the raspberry sauce was tasty but def not worth the large $14 dollar price. I'd rather go to cold stone. 

3. The frozen hot chocolate, their original hit  was okay, just wasn't a big fan of it. Maybe it's cause I'm not a big fan of hot chocolate I begin with.

I asked the waitress, who by the way was the coolest nicest person I met on my whole trip to Vegas, if the cheesecake was a NY cheesecake she replied ""Yes, and its life changing!""  LOL that was all I had to hear I was all over it. This cheesecake was HUGE and was NY cheesecake at its best. I even had two people come over to my table to ask what it was.  Very creamy not too sweet had a nut crust instead of the typical graham cracker.  No way can one person eat it.  I ended up taking the rest to my room and had leftovers that night and in the morning and shared it.  The restaurant has great seating that looks right over the strip and we lucked out and got a perfect seat that was right on the edge.  There are also lounge type areas with heaters and is a really nice place to hang out.  All the dishes are large and the variety of the menu has something for everyone.  Come to eat or just for dessert either way you wont be disappointed.  They also have a walk up window in the back if you don't want for a seat you can order to go stuff there.

Upon being seated everyone was really friendly and nice. Our waitress was great and super friendly.  She made up for her not so awesome hostess coworker.  

The decor was really strange here.  It is bit small for what looks to be a bigger space, at least on the inside.  It's nice and pink in here for the ladies and a nice looking bar area for the men.  They have a nice outdoor seating area, but too cold during December.  It would probably be really nice in the april-june months when it is not so unbearably hot.  

This is a good place to get desserts with you girlfriends that's if you are having a weekend in Vegas.

I had the Summer Bries. It is an open face sandwich.  Presentation is a definite plus with the cone wise fries. The Brie was not melted enough. There was a whole lot of turkey. Good cranberry cheese spread. Overall fair. Sweet potato fries good.  

My boyfriend got The Full Monty and the ciabatta bread was so good!
The Hangover omelet was so big and looks very filling.
The Frozen Hot Chocolate was fair.  It tasted like hot chocolate but in frozen form like a cold chocolate latte. Not my personal favorite.

So I sucked it up and put a smile on my face and continued to wait.

From the over-sized menus, I ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two and the onion rings (they're ginormous!) My boyfriend got the high heel pumps, an Italian style sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. The food wasn't anything special but we had a nice lunch.

Our hostess was very friendly and we enjoyed her until she had taken away our onion rings without asking. Of course, I complained and they were quite accommodating to the matter.

I was almost tempted to order the popular frozen hot chocolate, but since it was a chilly Vegas day, I decided on the regular hot chocolate instead.

The chunk of red velvet cake was surrounded by vanilla ice cream, whip cream, hot fudge, and rainbow sprinkles.

""I don't really care what we do. Well... I do want to go to Serendipity! :)""

Finally, and I mean FINALLY! I've been wanting to go to Serendipity's ever since I watched that movie Serendipity and that was circa ten years ago. Now that they have  a location in Vegas, my wish finally came true. 

This pink\/orange, girl decorated restaurant makes you feel like a little girl inside. It's decorated mostly white and pink with all these fancy plates that make you feel like you should have some tea and crumpets. Well, not all of the plates, just some of them. There was also a bar in the corner, and from the looks of it, it's a full bar? I never knew Serendipity's swung that way. 

Any way, luckily part of my group went there early to get us a table and they only waited 15 minutes. (If you don't want to wait, you can also order to go!) I expected it to be much longer but I'll settle with 15 minutes any day to come here. The place was packed and it took a while to get our orders in, aka the waitress took a while to get to us. A bunch of us hadn't eat all day (it was 4:30pm) and were ready to devour our own plates although the prices here are pretty hefty. I decided on the...

Summer Bries. It's a sandwich, an open faced one (aka only one slice of Raisin Pumpernickel bread), with turkey, cranberry mayo, brie cheese (melted), and crunchy-fresh apples. Can I tell you something? It was DEEEE-LISH! :D It made me so full that I could barely get out of my sit (or maybe that's just me since I hadn't eaten all day). And it also came with a side of cheese potato chips that were quite cheesy.. seemed like parmesan cheese I believe. That $16 sandwich was well worth my money.

And for dessert, well for the appetizer, a group of us shared the famous.. drum roll please... FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE! That sucker was so hot (not literally) that it was oozing out of the cup. Mmmm, whip cream, with a frothy, creamy, milk chocolate. It gave me some shivers, as well as a brain freeze. (I couldn't keep myself from drinking it all! Too bad I didn't have my own, because I would have devoured that sucker.)

What a wonderful time we had, my frozen hot chocolate and sandwich, and me. My Serendipity wish finally came true and I'm so happy it did :D (Cue Happily Ever After Music)",8,7,8

Instead of waiting 45 minutes for a table, we decided to sit at the empty bar so we could enjoy food and drinks before we headed out to PH to go see Peepshow.  (anyways, that's another review)

Serendipity is a cool, hip spot with a menu 3 times the size of my head and trust me, i got a big head! LOL

We opted for the kobe beef sliders, french fries and of course the Frozen Hot Chocolate.  As for drinks, I only had a beer and my friend had a blueberry peach mojito and a cran\/vodka.  The kobe beef sliders we so tasty and cooked\/seasoned very well.  It was so melt in your mouth and after having 4 of them along with their tasty crisp fries, it was quite enough!

The frozen hot chocolate was ridiculous! I've always heard of this but never experienced what others have.  Truly one of the best desserts i've had in my life.  Thank god we didnt get the ""for 2"" cup hahaaa  Unbelieveable dessert...I wonder if i can order the mix online??",1,1,1

My husband ordered the french toast, and I ordered an open faced apple & brie sandwich.  Totally recommend the french toast - it is HUGE, like a loaf of bread. It came with bacon, potatoes, egg, and fresh berries. My husband loved it, and I kept sneaking bites as well. Delicious.

Their sundaes are ENORMOUS...definitely meant for sharing. So while my friends did split plates of the openfaced pesto sandwich and meat pie, I chowed down on the good stuff. The humble (peanut butter) pie is smackingly scrumptious, but the crust is hard to navigate with your spoon. The real kicker was the coffee ice cream...sooo good! Who knew coffee & banana flavors melded so well?? Of course we topped it all off with the frozen hot chocolate. Little did I know it tastes almost about as good when you make it with the packet at home.

My family and I checked out Serendipity for lunch on Sunday morning. It was pretty crowded when we arrived around 10 AM so we were told we would have to wait for 20-30 minutes. I really liked how the hostess was using an ipad that would message my iphone when our table was ready =) You are given the option of sitting inside or out but we wanted inside because it was getting really hot outside already. Thankfully we only had to wait 10 or so minutes before I received a text saying our table was ready. 

When we sat down our table was pretty wet since they just cleaned it. We ordered really quickly since we had looked at the menu while we were waiting and we figured it shouldn't take that long to get our food. Unfortunately, we waited 30-40 minutes for our breakfast -___- I was getting REALLY HUNGRY since we were seeing all the people around us receive food and we weren't getting squat... FINALLY our food came over and we were amazed by how big the portions were. My pancakes were ginormous, my mom's steak sandwich was an entire baguette, and my boyfriend's waffles were the size of your head. 

Blueberry pancakes: Super nom. They put a good amount of blueberries in there and they don't drown the pancakes in butter like normal places do. Syrup was great and on the side.

Steak Sandwich: MASSIVE. The steak was very good and they add bacon and three fried eggs to the sandwich. The bread is an entire baguette aka way too much for one person to finish. The potatoes on the side were over seasoned (too salty) and they burned the first batch so we made them make some more. 

Corned Beef Hash and Eggs: NOM. The hash here is super fresh and meaty, WOW!! I was jealous of my dad's plate after he gave me a bite of the hash. They give you 4 pieces of bread though which was kind of overkill.

Banana Cream Waffles: Satisfy your sweet tooth. Two waffles with bananas, cream, raspberries, blackberries and chocolate sauce. Not for the faint of heart.

Let's start with the service. My boyfriend and I walked in from the street side, the patio area facing Flamingo, not too sure where the front is. There where no signs and we both obviously looked a little lost, as we walked and stopped to look for a host a couple times. On our way to finally finding the front entrance, we passed by at least two servers that just stared at us. I wouldn't go as far as saying that they glared, but they definitely didn't look friendly or offer their assistance. When we were greeted by the host, we were told that there would be a 15-20 minute wait for the patio, which is fine since we had time, but I just find it confusing because only a third of the tables in the patio area was even occupied. Also, we weren't told that there was an option to place Togo orders at their window out front with open seating. When we finally got seated, our server didn't come by until 10 minutes later and he didn't even ask us for our drink order first. He just assumed we were ready to order. He brought out our frozen hot chocolate even before getting our water, which in total was about 20 minutes before we were offered a drink. Very disappointed with the service, but if you have a total rewards card, you do get a discount, so there's a plus for you. 

Now onto the long anticipated frozen hot chocolate. I've seen so many amazing photos and read a ton of great reviews about this staple of theirs, but honestly, it was just okay. It's literally what the name is - chilled hot chocolate. It's not that special and really was just alright. Don't get me wrong, I'm a chocolate lover, but this really didn't do much for me.

Waited in line to order at the walk-up window, as others have done. When it was time to place our order, the attendant was not paying attention. We had to repeat our order multiple times (a small Peanut Butter Frozen Hot Chocolate) since he was having more fun conversing with a co-worker. Next, we moved forward to the pick-up window where there were some annoyed looking people. 

We waited. We watched those in the kitchen --- some working, others standing around. We waited. Those around us waited. Every once in awhile an order came up -- typically orders for a few scoops of ice cream. More time passed. Orders placed after ours were called. Other orders before ours still were not ready. Person at the window started to make a frozen drink at one point, then stopped. Tickets were rearranged -- one thrown away. Time kept ticking. 

Finally, we asked about our order and when it would be ready. Guy at the window looked at his tickets and did not have ours. Perhaps ours had been the order that we had seen him throw away earlier? Or, maybe the person who took our order never put it in the right spot? Either way, he was rude about it and wanted our ticket, which we gave to him. Next, he went back to the frozen drink that he started to make earlier and gave it to us. If we hadn't been there watching, I think he would have spit in it based on his attitude. 

Drink was too sweet to be enjoyable.",1,1,0

That's what I hear the most about, and that's the only item that I have tried, but it was amazing!!! A bit pricey, since it's hot chocolate and all but it was good. I got their regular frozen hot chocolate and the frozen peanut butter hot chocolate. In my preference, I liked the regular one better than the peanut one because the peanut butter was too peanut buttery, if you know what I mean. It was just too overpowering of the hot chocolate flavor. 

The frozen hot chocolate were good. Imagine you were drinking a hot chocolate, but now cold and blended. It comes with the whipped cream and everything!",5,2,3

(As my friend pointed out, they always said, ""Welcome to Serendipity 3!"") It was a cold, windy night in Vegas, but we still wanted to try their signature Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. We decided to sit outside, because it was really cramped inside--our 15 minute wait lasted for 2 minutes. Outside they have two types of heaters--these giant industrial flat heaters and the flaming towers of fire. Pick the flat heaters--they're stronger and provide wider heat.

Mint Frrrozen Hot Chocolate- 3-stars- I've always been a fan of mint chocolate, ever since eating a failed mint chocolate cookie in New York City (not related to Serendipity), but I've always been undecided with hot chocolate flavors. So now, I get mint chocolate whenever I see it--to understand the subtle differences each version makes. This huge cup\/bowl is covered with whipped cream. It has a rich chocolate flavor, but the mint is very light. The dish on the bottom acting like a reservoir is very helpful, because you'll find chocolate seeping over the edges constantly. It was very busy, as the waiter told us about three times, while we waited for our hot chocolates--he said the blenders were working as fast as possible. It was funny, since we ended up waiting about as long as we were told to wait for a table. Still, with all things considered, I don't know if the final product was worth the cost.

Ambiance- Being on the Strip, being able to sit above people and look down on them, that's grand. Sitting at night, with a mixture of 40-degree wind and flaming towers, with the lights of Vegas in the background--priceless. The decor and look of the place is great. I really wanted the lounge corner with all the pillows and seats under those great big heaters.

Service- Seemed a little disappointed we only ordered frozen hot chocolate, but those babies are not cheap either. My friend got the Espresso, asking for beans, but they said the beans are included in that one--but when she got it, they said they just ran out of beans. Sadness for her. Still, it wasn't too late--about 8 p.m. So they still had a few more hours, and with the popularity of coffee, I assume a lot more espresso orders. So that's a little weird.

Conclusion- Go for the notoriety and bragging rights to say, ""I went to Serendipity 3!"" Go ahead and get the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, any season since they got good heaters--especially if you're a chocolate lover. But be aware of the popularity, the wait, and time you'll take for your frozen treat. Hey, at least you can look at people on the Strip and when they back you can wave at them! I'm above you! Yay!",3,2,3

Service is average. Our server was somewhat friendly, but every time we would request for more water or napkins, he would make sarcastic jokes and say get it yourself. hmm. (0 _o)

Looking at the enormous menu, literally. I ordered the ""Black and Blue Burger"" which is actually pretty good. It included your choice of french fries or sweet potato fries. Ordered ""The Hangover"" which is omelet with french fries, cheese, and mushrooms. The hangover was just okay. A bit dry.

Normally it gets packed late night and the hostess will get your # down on an ipad which will text you when your table is ready. You can always to-go your stuff at the window next door, but my friends have told me the frozen hot chocolate tastes better ordering it in the restaurant.

Everything seems to be in big portions here & the HUGE menu (literally) is cute.

Frozen hot chocolate for 2 - For my first visit my bf & I shared this. It was DELICIOUS! I was really mind blown that it wasn't overly sweet. The drink does is supposed to be 17 oz when you order the ""for 2 size"" the for 1 is 10 oz. I think it's cheaper to order frozen hot choco for 1 b\/c the rest of the 5 oz in the for 2 seemed like it was just extra whipped cream. I love the chocolate shavings topped on the drink. It's fun to scoop and sip at the same time. Definite must try! Hard to describe the consistency, but it's icy and not too thick (for those that think it's a milkshake)

Hangover omelette - This is the perfect omelette that sounds delicious when you have a hangover so the name suits the food. Bacon, fries, mushrooms, and cheese inside an omelette yumm. My friend ordered this and it looked really good, I took a bite and it was a great combo of all the ingredients.

Crab Cake Sandwich - I got this protein style. The nice crab cakes are wrapped in soft butter lettuce. I liked the crab cakes, it wasn't too oily and stuffed with a good amount of crab.The beefsteak tomatoes, bacon, and spinach accompanied the sandwich well. 

Mint frozen hot chocolate - On my recent vegas trip 10\/18\/13, we decided to order this 'cause I'm a big mint chip ice cream fan. My bf & I agreed this was a lot better than their original frozen hot chocolate and usually he's not a big fan of mint chip. Basically it's their original frozen hot chocolate, but they blend it w\/ a scoop of mint ice cream! I guess it sort of tasted like the Andes mint candy

Make sure you get a total rewards card at one of the casinos (Caesar, PH) so that you can get the total rewards discount pricing on the food & Points!

One day I hope I hit the jackpot to try the Golden Opulence Sundae here ($1000 sundae!?)

BTW if it's your first time I suggest you check around what other tables are ordering to see what you'd like. I saw a couple of tables get the can't say no sundae and other sundaes that looked sooo good!!! Will be back to try their other menu items. I swear you can get fat just looking with your eyes",8,4,7

Being a little quirky about my meals - I skipped past the crazy waffle concoctions and discovered a shrimp and asparagus frittata served with a green salad on top?  Really?  Could it get any more perfect for me?  Everyone at the table ordered something different - banana waffles, eggs benedict, breakfast quesadilla and everyone was very happy.  The portions are massive - so be prepared and come with an appetite or bring home leftovers.  I LOVED my frittata.  I think egg whites are a waste and asked if it could be made with the whole eggs, which is not a problem.  When the food arrived it all looked so pretty.  I was delighted with my frittata.  The salad on top was fresh and the dressing flavorful.  The frittata itself was full of big pieces of asparagus and shrimp... and had some asparagus and shrimp on top.  VERY filling.  Very good.  I was stuffed until dinner... and even then, could barely eat.  We also had a coupon for a free 10 oz. frozen hot chocolate.  This was a total score!  Plenty for two and very rich.  If you're a chocolate person - this is not to be missed.  Even without a coupon, I would get this to share with someone... worth the money for a very sweet treat.  The service was good.

What we ordered:

Chicken and Waffle - Crispy juicy fried chicken with waffles and I love the sauce that comes with fried chicken. It's like honey mustard. 

Fried Egg Benedict - Ham and biscuit topped with literally a fried poached egg.
The idea of a battered fried egg is good but it was not well executed. The egg white was a bit hardened and the outside of the egg was kinda soggy.

Chocolate French Toast - Not a big fan of chocolate, but I'm a fan of french toast. Sweeeeeeeeetttttt. Prob recommended for chocolate lovers.

When I came to this location located in front of Caesars, I was surprised and pleased to see they have upgraded there menu and have numerous delicious flavors to choose from.  We had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table, however it wasn't too bad as they text you when your table is ready.  Honestly it was hard to choose just one flavor after perusing the menu.  They also have a number of amazing desserts to choose from, as well as brunch, lunch, and dinner options.  We had come here strictly for the frozen hot chocolate, thus I decided to stick to that.  My parents and I split the almond amaretto flavor as the waitress told us that was the most popular flavor on the menu after the regular chocolate one.  I wanted to try something new as I had the chocolate one in NYC.  We got the smaller size (meant for 1) and it was absolutely HUGE.  It also comes with a mound of whip cream adding to the already yummy flavor.  We all loved it and would definitely come back to try another flavor.  Our server was really sweet and drink came out fast.   

Can definitely get on the pricier side as our one frozen hot chocolate was $14.  Most of the desserts are in that price range as well and then menu items run around $17 and up.

came here with the fam so we were able to split a bunch of eats.  my bro and i split the reuben and the breakfast steak sandwich.  both were freaking delicious.  the reuben was so good.  the corned beef was nice and tender.  the steak sandwich was craaaazy huge.  we were able to split it into threes, as there were three over easy eggs.  i seriously think it was a foot long.

we also got the chicken pot pie, foot-long hot dog, the high heel pump (prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella), waffle fries and sweet potato fries.  all were super duper delicious.

we also got the 2 for 1 margaritas.  not the greatest...they were a little too sweet for me, but definitely still drinkable.  =)

for dessert, we of course got the frozen hot chocolate.  it was mostly for the kids, but i must say it was quite tasty.  

the wait wasn't too long at all.  there were nine of us and we ate around 8pm on a saturday night.  the wait was about 10-15 minutes.  the only downfall, which is making me give them a 4.5 was the service.  one girl, who i believe was responsible for seating parties was just a b.  not nice at all...no smiles, rude voice, etc.  she wasn't fun.  our waitress was very nice although it took a bit of time for her to get around to us in the beginning.

One word just about sums it up - overrated!  Went here for breakfast and ordered the Frozen hot chocolate french toast, hangover omlet and the kids teddy bear pancakes, along with the frozen hot chocolate for two for dessert.  

The omelet was super dry (had to lather on ketchup and tobasco), the kids pancakes looked like something I could whip up at home, the french toast was mediocre and the frozen hot chocolate was definetly only worth $5 instead of $15.  For that amount of money, I was expecting something that eluded excellence from the very first sip. 

The service was also tremendously slow and it wasn't even crowded.  We saw our food sitting under heat lamps just waiting to be brought to our table for a good 15 minutes or so.  I've had better breakfast at iHop and cheaper.  Most defintely not worth $65 for our meal.  

Advice?  If you really want to try the frozen hot chocolate, order it from the take out window.  As for me, I'd rather spend $15 on a tall frothy better tasting beverage from Fat Tuesday!",0,0,0

The food here comes in large portions that even someone like me will have a hard time finishing.  I ordered the strawberry milkshake and the spicy penne pasta with huge uncut prosciutto and mozzarella laid over the top, and my gf ordered the wood grilled salmon item (I think it's the only salmon featured item in the menu). 

So now it's been three days and I can't stop thinking about the milkshake. The pasta on the other hand was so much that I couldn't even try to finish half of it after sharing a caesar salad with my gf.  I didn't think much of the salmon but my gf ended up finishing her meal completely.

I hate all these reviews about how its so expensive... id rather go here or here or here... for the amount we spent its not worth it....Your in Vegas everything is gona cost money, go to a cheap buffet if your broke... 

As for Serendipity I loved the place. We started out the the Chicken Nachos, I ordered the One-Eyed Jack and we finished with the Outrageous Banana Split (Coward's Portion). All was awesome. I loved them each. The Nachos were huge and the Sandwich was even bigger and extra tasty the Banana Split was everything you can hope for and the Cowards portion was big enough for my wife and I.

We looked across the street and the newly opened Serendipity was calling the names of the ladies in the group; with its bright pink sign and memories of the darling movie which bears the same name. So we sauntered over and were told there was a 20 minute wait. For a Friday night in Vegas, 20 minutes is a blink of an eye. We were called in less than half that time and taken in to be seated. The inside of the restaurant is a little girls dream; pink and blue recessed ceilings, huge colorful light fixtures, and a giant bright pink clock. The menu is fairly extensive for a place that I would have considered more of a dessert spot. The actual food items are MASSIVE. I kid you not, some of the largest items of food I have ever seen given to one person. The sweet potato fries that accompany the entrees are to die for. If you like them even in the slightest, I urge you to give these a shot. They are sprinkled with some sort of cinnamon\/sugar\/salt combo that is just divine. I ordered the chicken strips (lame I know) because I wasn't feeling all that well and wanted something I could trust. They were actually wonderful and came with three sauces for dipping. My tablemates ordered the worlds largest hot dog California style, a Turkey club that was the size of a VW Bug and a take on a caprese sandwich that weighed as much as a newborn baby. Everything was truly delicious. The drinks from the bar that we ordered (a cranberry mojito) were a little on the weak side, but I think that's what I've come to expect in this fair city. All in all, we had a great meal. The service was great until the waitress dropped a dish down my back. Luckily it was empty and only left crumbs and small food smear. Could have been much worse. I would dine here again for more than one reason, but the biggest one being - we didn't have dessert!! Shameful, trust me, I know. But we were all so stuffed from the massive portions.

So I went to the take-out window where there was also a line!  The line wasn't as bad but what was bad was the slow service... it was extremely slow.. the worker apologized everyone for the wait since he was the only one working there with a cook in the back.. It just bugged me since the only thing I ordered was the Frozen Hot Chocolate dessert and I had to wait a good time for it...... Also, it looked to me like he was literally taking his time even though there was a line outside... oyeee that bugs me!!

Ironic .. Frozen hot chocolate.. I am usually not a big fan of chocolatey things since I am scared they overdo it on the sweetness and chocolate thickness.. But I may say it was pretty good!  Good mixture of ice and chocolate which made it extremely refreshing in the hot humid vegas weather!  My friend and I enjoyed it in the many tables and seats they had in the outdoor patio, which was nice!  But of course, the alternative was to run inside Caesar's for some nice air conditioning!

When I found out that they were opening one in Las Vegas, I really wanted to try it. So the next trip I took to Las Vegas, I wanted to make sure I went to Serendipity 3.

My boyfriend and I took a spontaneuos trip to Las Vegas sometime last August. We just got out of Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum and we walked towards Caesar's Palace where Serendipity 3 was. Yay!! When we arrived it was around lunchtime and it was very busy. We asked how long it would be to get a table. The hostess said about half an hour to 45 minutes. We didn't want to wait that long just to get their Frozen Hot Chocolate, so the hostess suggested that we order from their take out window, which was near by. So we ordered the dessert from the window and got our treat in a large take out cup. I was actually looking forward to getting it in their glass cup.. oh well. Took our first sip and it was yummy.

The next day, we came back to dine in. We weren't that hungry, but we wanted something small to eat, so we ordered their Safe at Home Kobe Beef Sliders. 4 small tiny burgers with American Cheese and a smear of Bacon Aioli on the plate. They're much smaller than your average slider and at $12 a plate, I don't think I'll be ordering that again if I decide to come back to Serendipity 3.

Come here for the dessert, but you can actually have a decent meal here!

High points: 
 - They expanded the dining area by removing the merchandise counter.  
 - The food here is a lot better than it was in the past.  *The nachos are actually really yummy if you are looking to share something quick before your dessert.
 - You get a discount on many food orders by being a member of Total Rewards.
 - The Frrrozen hot chocolate is really quite yummy.

Keep in mind:
 - It is pretty pricey compared to establishments with similar offerings.
 - The wait can be long at times.

the wait is always long, though the takeout window seemed to be moving much faster than our wait time for  table. it also took a really long time to get our food, even though all we got was sundaes and a milkshake. didn't mind since the place is nice to hang out.

two stars because our waiter hated us. maybe because we just ordering desserts and he's used to bigger orders, but even with that we were spending at least forty dollars. that was kind of annoying since we weren't even spending extra time there, just waiting for our food. i have to say that soured the experience a little. if i'm ever back here again, i'd probably do the takeout window. but the ice cream really is good.",1,0,0

Once upon a time, John Cusack fell in love with Kate Beckinsdale in movie make-believe at a little whimsical chocolate shop in uptown Manhattan and sent Serendipity 3 into a dizzying spiral of Hollywood fame and public craze.  

When I lived in Manhattan 4 years ago, along with hundreds of tourists on a Saturday morning, I waited to experience the fantasy of movie magic and the famed Frozen Hot Chocolate in this fairytale of a chocolate shop\/eatery.  It was fun for the experience.  The chocolate was outstanding and the food was all right.

It is four years later in Vegas, nine years since the movie and long past the 15 minutes given to Serendipity 3.  A location of this charming original opens up right in front of Caesars Palace to cater to undiscriminating tourists in their hung-over states.  The overblown decor becomes cheesy, not whimsical.  The glamorous fair food comes with mediocre quality.

At best, you can say you've been to Serendipity 3.  I suggest getting the desserts at the take-out stand rather than waiting for a seat at the restaurant.  You'll have a better time seeing the movie again.",5,4,4

My impression is that this place survives only because of its position and nice patio.

When we entered we waited a few minutes for anyone to give us a table, few waitresses were taking to each other in a corner and didn't bother talking to us.
Only on our way out we were told that the place was full and 45 minutes of waiting time.

We decided to try the chocolate take away, since only 8\/10 person were in line at the window.
That took almost as much as waiting for a table, 30 minutes, and only because some of the people in front of us gave up and left exasperated.
No surprise, since the girls in the kitchen were basically doing the chocolates one by one instead of taking few orders and pipelining a bit.

We walked in and asked for a table for 8. The hostess responds,""It's going to be an hour wait."" In a rude and I hate my job and hate customers voice. Which made no sense because all of the outside patio was empty and half of the inside was empty. So we said ok we will be right back. We go outside and discuss if we still want to eat here. Half of our group said never mind. So me and three others decide to eat here. We go back inside and tell the exact same hostess table for 4. She responds with,""We can't split parties!"" (In her I hate you people voice). First of all, did i say we were being split parties? No. Do you see the rest of my group here? No. Did you make a HUGE 'ol assumption? Yes.

When our pager finally buzzed, we were led to the outdoor seating overlooking the strip. What I first noticed was the many empty tables. I guess they were just understaffed? Anyway, we sat down at an average looking table. For some reason I had pictured this place to be extremely cute and a lot more.. New York-ish? 

Our server took what felt like ages to even take our order and when he finally arrived at our table, he didn't seem enthusiastic at all. We ordered the large frozen hot chocolate for 2, which was $15. We both took a sip of the frozen hot chocolate at the same time and probably had the same surprised look on our faces. We were very disappointed with the quality of the ever so famous drink. It tasted no more like melted ice cream or even a super icy milkshake.

Decor wise, it is nothing compared to NYC, however, it is the closest thing and as good as it'll get for being in Vegas.  I am not rating the restaurant itself nor am I reviewing the food, because usually when I am in town, I only set aside enough time for dessert here. :)  

It's easy to find because it's right on the strip and it's right in front of Caesars Palace, no brainer.   The times I have gone I haven't had to wait and I was able to immediately satisfy my Frozen Hot Chocolate craving.

I've never had a problem with cleanliness, service, or otherwise.  

If you're kind-of a fan or you're a real fan, you know what's up with the original Serendipity story and location.  Overall, it's a fun place and you can't expect much from Vegas.. LOL!",2,0,1

Arriving late into Vegas with the kids I asked our concierge to recommend somewhere to take two kids 8 and 10 for dinner. He couldn't recommend Serendipity high enough for food for kids. I guess kids must have lower standards ? Anyway I like  to grade my dinning reviews on a few things. 

Service; we didn't experience any wait time apparently that's the norm for this time of season so walked starlight in. We we're meet promptly and seated straight away. (Forgot to mention my parents joined us so we were a party of 5).  That was all good but we were seated between the front door the front desk and the kitchen. With plenty of other options I thought this was poor choice. Our server was polite but surly to start with, she warmed up during our stay ( Aussie accent helps sometimes). Kitchen staff were excellent, my son is dairy and gluten free and they went out of there way to make hi something to eat which was great but sadly no one else got this good a food.

Food; being a beef farmer I like to eat steak just about everywhere I go and the steak and fries I ordered arrived in good time but the fries were cold and the steak ordinary. My daughter got the mini cheese burgers which she ate half of one and passed on the rest. I bit into the second one and could see why, the meat was bland and all you could taste was old grease from the grill, yuk.

Dad went safe with a sundae and was happy enough but then nothing much phases him when it has whipped cream.

Mum just had some fries which also arrived cold and no flavour at all.

So in summary the food was below expectation and the service average.",0,0,0

From Mandalay Bay, this was a long walk considering I was a little sore and tired.  The cafe is located just outside of Caesar's Palace and we took the tram to Excalibur, hopped over a few bridges, and arrived to discover there's a 30 minute wait.  Boo!

It was cold so we stayed inside and took in the decor.  It's a candy striped wall, plenty of pinks and girly stuff.  The girl inside of you will squeal in delight or be annoyed by all the pink stuff.  I didn't mind it too much.  

We got the pasta dish and the bacon cheeseburger. Our food wasn't bad but the pasta was overwhelming.  Having pasta the night before and having it again probably wasn't such a good idea.  It tastes good at first when it's nice and hot but as it starts to cool and the cheese starts to congeal, it gets boring and overwhelming.  I don't think I'll eat pasta again until another race.  

We didn't have room for dessert but we did order the hot chocolate.  This is a yummy, rich, and delicious drink with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and orange zest.  It was the perfect drink for a cold day in Vegas.",3,3,3

I got the fried eggs benedict.  The dredge the poached eggs in corn meal and fry them.  It's a cool idea, but I like my egg yolks runny.  Instead of a muffin they used a biscuit with hammed up country gravy as a plate base while still topping with the hollandaise sauce.

This thing was very good, but it was a damned gut bomb.  I wished I was drunk before I ate it to fulfill the drunk munchies.

The gf got their french toast log.  It comes with bacon, eggs, seasoned potatoes, fresh berried and cream and syrup.  Freaking crap! They weren't kidding when the named it a log.  This thing is basically a small loaf of bread with the crust cut off.  I'm assuming they do a typical soak, except after the soak they crust up the outside in corn flakes.  The corn flakes make for a nice different texture to the soft spongy interior of the log.  The seasoned potatoes were really good, eggs not so much, bacon unknown as I didn't have any.  I would have liked the bread to be soaked a little longer, but then that might have put the integrity of the log shape in jeopardy.

The frozen hot chocolate for the price is not worth it, which is why I didn't get any.  Go to William Sonoma and buy some packages yourself and make it at home.  I only assume the were good since the two rude Texan couples that sat next to us, one couple on each side and yelling over us to chat with each other, as they were there for the shit kicker convention, enjoyed the frozen hot cocolate

My best friend and I have been wanting to go here since last summer in August 2009. This time on our 24-trip to Vegas back on 3\/4 to 3\/5, we decided to finally hit this place up!  

We came by a little too early, (they opened at 11am, we had gotten up extra early-- so killed some time by walking around Caesar's Palace.)  When we finally got in, we were seated immediately and got a look at the menu.  I love the layout---it's a little bit antique and 1920's vibe.  I loved the caricatures of ladies drinking from huge ""jugs"" of ice cream bowls.  Silly silly silly!  I was hungry and decided to order the chicken pot pie.  It had better  be good considering the size... 10.95 for a pot pie! Wow.  The crust was ample, flakey, and just the right buttery goodness.  The cream sauce, chunks of potato, carrots, and peas were just the right size to spoon up and chew.  The chicken was nice and tender... and thankfully this pot pie didn't feel like I was eating coagulated barf stew. (I'll tell y'all about my pot pie craving and run to Marie Calendar's  another day.)  So the pot pie was delish! 

My friend got the spinach, tomato, and egg omelet topped w\/ mozzarella cheese.  It was a huge omelet, and she barely had enough space to finished her criss-cut fries.  Waitress was very helpful and quick.  We definitely did not have space for dessert (even though that was the whole point of going there in the first place!) so we told her we'd  come back later!--- That we did!---

We came back and took forever to decide over so many different choices.  I forgot the name of the one we got... but it was so chock full of whip cream, vanilla syrup and chocolate syrup... that humongous sundae was enough to feed 3 ppl.

I think they're good but I'm not sure if the drinks are worth the price of $12 a person - they just taste like icy milkshakes? Hard to explain I guess. It's worth a try but I wouldn't order it repeatedly. 

The wait here is also very long - we came at like 2:30pm on a Sunday and we had to wait about 45 min just to get a seat. Come back and check very often - sometimes they just skip over you if you're not there.",1,0,0

You'll pay for the food but hey, it's Vegas. The interior gives off a kitschy 50's vibe, our server was friendly and kept the fountain drink cups full. I'd bet this is a good place to visit after a few beers and the hamburgers can help soak up some of that alcohol! The burgers are served dry for some odd reason- you have to ask for the condiments and toppings. The fries are excellent, battered and crispy.

The hangover omelet had no flavor, over cooked, and was luke warm. 

The grilled cheese was probably good, but how can you mess up the grilled cheese? Oh by not having the soup ready at the same time. It also came out luke warmer best. 

Their hot dog... Is a hot dog... But bigger. That's all.

(I don't understand why in Vegas, the service isn't better when there are so many other different places people can choose over your restaurant or bar or lounge, etc. Boggles my mind.)

When  we walked in, no one greeted us, the two hostesses were just chatting up at the door, they saw us, but didn't care. It took about 2 minutes before they asked us ""2?"" 

Sat down, ordered our food, server didn't give a shit either. He never once came back to check on us. Actually he was no where to be found, he came out, but didn't stop by our table when we were ready to leave. I had to ask for a togo box from another server. 

The food here, like in New York isn't all that great. Food you can get at TGIFridays or any other joint. Seared Ahi Salad was meh, the seared ahi was completely crusted in sesame\/black seeds and it was somewhat disgusting. The salad part was good though, how do you go wrong throwing a bunch of lettuce and toppings on a plate. The Buffalo Chicken Pizza was a little overwhelming. It said that blue cheese crumbles, but it was more like blue cheese glops in a few spots of the pizza.

Our server was very friendly and nice. He gave great suggestions. 

Decor is cute. Makes you feel cheery. 

I ordered the Tropical smoothie, which was good. I wanted something refreshing, and it hit the spot. 

For lunch, I ordered the Huevos Rancheros. Delicious. Crispy tortilla layers with black beans, tomatillo sauce, chopped chorizo, cheese and 3 over easy eggs. No clean way to eat it. Just dig in and mix everything around. The flavors are wonderful together. 

My friend got the Cinnamon French Toast, which is GINORMOUS. HUGE, but very good. You're definitely getting your money's worth with that order. The toast is really fluffy and thick, and you might not even need the syrup. It tastes great on its own. 

We, of course, ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate. It was my first time getting it. The only complaint... they brought it out with all of our food, so we didn't try it until after we ate. By that time, it was melted, and just pretty much chocolate milk. Very chocolatey and thick, but I would've preferred it slushed. The whipped cream and chocolate slush would've been delicious together.

Service: Friendly and helpful, a little overzealous with table cleanup. Where'd my napkin go?

First course: Spinny Dippin' spinach artichoke dip with freshly-made tortilla chips and real bits of good-quality Reggiano cheese that melted before your eyes, so tasty! I also got to sample the Madras Mojito with cranberries muddled within the mint, it was very flavorful and went down smoothly. Dinner course consisted of an ABC Burger: avocado, brie, and caramelized onions all combined within a single bite that harmonizes the sweetness of the perfectly-cooked, golden-brown onions, blended with the tang of the brie, and mildness of the avocado performed a symphony of Beethoven-like proportions and encored perfectly with sweet potato fries. Excellent indeed! Finally dessert was served, a Peanut Butter Frrrrrrozen Hot Chocolate finished off a perfect meal.

We ordered the frozen hot chocolate, since it's their signature dessert, and the waitress recommended the fried oreo sundae. The frozen hot chocolate was not bad.

Since I wasn't able to go to the location in New York, I figured I would just go in Vegas. First time I went on Christmas, for lunch, I went myself and sat at the bar (since the wait was about 30 minutes for a table). I ordered myself a frozen hot chocolate and a side of sweet potato fries. The frozen hot chocolate is HUGE. The size for one is plenty for a table. The bar is a great place to eat if all your people are over 21 and there are seats there. The frozen hot chocolate itself 

The second time I went with the kids on the trip to vegas (4 of them between 16 and 18). I reserved a table for all of us, but we were able to be seated quite quickly. At around 10, there aren't as many people in the restaurant. The service, though, once seated was a little spotty. It took a while to get someone to take our order..and then get the food. 

The smores hot chocolate (which is what one of the girls got) looked good, but they forgot the graham crackers and didn't bring them until we asked for them. Also the hot chocolate had a huge mound of marshmallows so if you dont like those - don't get it. 

My brother ended up getting the Oreo version of the frozen hot chocolate which tasted like oreo hot chocolate but cold. This second time I ordered the Forbidden Broadway Sundae (chocolate blackout cake, chocolate and vanilla ice creams, and a shit ton of whipped cream). So delicious, but halfway in, I was so full, I couldn't take another bite. The cake wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've ever had.

We are not picky people, so we are coming from a pretty low-key place....

If you are a fan of the quaint Manhattan bistro, Serendipity, don't come to this place. 

If you are really on the jones about, or haven't experienced the Manhattan location and want to have a Frozen Hot Chocolate, step on in, but prepared to be underwhelmed by everything else. 

Having visited the Manhattan location several times, how surprised was I to see a Serendipity on the Strip in Las Vegas. Wonderful! I thought, this should be fun.

Sadly, like anything good and decent left, this had been turned into a horrible corporate basterdised version of what is a charming little restaurant.

When we arrived, (around 2:00) the restaurant was about 70% full inside. We stopped at the hostess stand where the two girls there informed us it would be a 20 minute wait for inside. Huh, says I, looking around, there are 4 tables here that are empty and just need to be bused. Thinking that the hostesses would pitch in and hussle to bus these tables and help the waitstaff... well...what was I thinking? My husband also asked them about his Players Club card from Caesars. Supposedly we got some sort of points or discount, whatever, but it was important to him. Again, just stares and finally one says, ""Oh, well, just give that to your waiter.""  These girls had much better things to do, like debate their natural hair color, or stare at the wall and wonder why their heads didn't float away.

After 20 minutes (and seeing there were now 5 empty, clean tables), I wandered back in and asked if they were ready for us.  The hostess asked me if I wanted to be put on the waitlist. No, I gently explained, we have a buzzer. Not only did she call me by the wrong name, but wanted to know if we wanted to sit outside..

Sigh. 

Somehow, even dealing with Bim and Bim, we managed to get sat. 

10 minutes later, our server appeared. No friendly introduction, no ""Hi, Welcome"" just ""What can I get you to drink?"" My husband asked about his Players Club card again, and the waiter looking like they had no idea what we were talking about, mumbled something about the hostesses or something at the end of the meal...my husband just closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose.

Waters took another 5 minutes and thank God, after our 20 minute wait outside we knew what we wanted, or that would have been another 20 minutes waiting.

 The food was good. Solid enough and for Vegas pricing, not the worst I've seen. We got a couple appetizers: Sliders and Chicken Strips. The kitchen seemed overwhelmed by the 3 tickets in the window, which isn't a good sign and the manager was out expo-ing the line. Again, not a great sign of a restaurant you'd think should run like clockwork since it's not that busy. We were given our food (not by our server) and dug in. Sliders were good, a little dry, but the chicken strips were very good. I recommend them if you brave this place.

Trying to save some sort of this experience, I attempted to engage our server in conversation, however that turned out to be teeth grinding, and my husband just started shaking his head. 

All in all, we did get our frozen hot chocolate, but the experience deflated the fabulousness that this desert holds and I know for any future visits to Serendipity, I'll keep it out of Sin City and in the Big Apple.",1,0,0

Pleasantly surprised that there was no reservation needed. It was packed, but we were seated almost immediately during each visit.

I had a burger and it was wayyy too big. I tried squishing it down, cutting pieces out of it, eating it without the bun. Whatever I tried to deconstruct it, I just ended up eating the fries until I was full. The flavor was average for the burger. My friend got a salad and it was a hefty sized salad, but she said it was just whatever and she's had better.

Now to the best part, the dessert! The Mint Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is one of my favorites! I visit in the summer and it's so refreshing. I tried a couple of the drugstore sundaes as well. My favorite would be the Red Velvet Sundae. The Deep Fried Oreos & Ice Cream Sundae was good as well, but not great. The Oreos are uniquely battered and coated with cornflakes. It did offer a crunch, but that wasn't really something that was appealing. For me, I wasn't a fan of this. I'm more use to the simple pancake battered fried Oreos. Definitely plan on sharing.

That being said I can take my ""fan"" hat off long enough to offer an objective review ;)

Price Point?:  Moderate.  OK I sorta feel like the famous ""Frozzzen Hot Chocolate"" is seriously over-priced @ $15, but everything else is moderately priced.

Serving Sizes?: Huge!

Food:  I really like it, though I can see why some people comment the food is not overly flavorful.  For me, I like subtle flavors so I'm generally happy with it.  Those who like an abundance of flavor may be a little disappointed.

Service?:  So-So.  I couldn't complain about the service levels, though there really is nothing special about them either.  We were there Christmas morning and the hostess wasn't dealing so well with being busy though - something that should be a given for a hostess but oh well.  If the service levels were better I'd give this restaurant a 5 all day long.

So what have I tried?!  Here's a quick list of some of the things my husband and I have tried when visiting:

Alfredo:  I'm a pasta fan, I just can't resist.  I have to say this was the most enjoyable Alfredo I've had in, wow ages!  The pasta was not thick and starchy, the sauce was creamy yet amazingly light.  Flavors were spot on also.  This is my fav dish - haha obviously.  Serving size is quite big, It's more than enough for two meals for me and yup I take a doggie bag!

Side Ceasar:  Generous portion of salad as a side, we shared it :)  They don't skimp on what's in it either.

Foot-long Hot Dog with Chilli:  So this went down a treat with my husband.  Yes, it's huge!  He loved it though :)

Meatball Sandwich: Hubby's choice, again he loved it!  Huge serving, he didn't get through it all but he truly enjoyed every bite he had.

Frozen Hot Chocolate:  Yum :)  I couldn't finish mine, but I'm a light eater. OK this is obviously a signature drink, but as above in my mind it is over-priced.  I'd never order again - half of it is a seriously thick whipped cream.  Cream lovers rejoice, I couldn't get through even half of the cream though :P 

Kobe Sliders:  These were just OK.  I'd not order them again though nor did the leave any lingering memories of their awesomeness.  If you want something smaller and lighter off the menu though, this is a plus.

Banana Split:  Cowards Serving.  This is just decadent!!!  Banana, Chocolate Ice Cream, Strawberry Ice Cream, Vanilla Ice Cream, Chocolate Syrup, Caramel Syrup, Strawberry & Raspberry Syrup all topped off with whipped cream and Cherries.  This is just wow .... Seriously I ordered the cowards portion knowing I am a light eater and the server said it was great for one when really it would be good for 2 or 3.  If you have kids, let them share this size - I'd hate to see how big the $22\/$24 serving is!!!!  It was great ... just wow a lot of food and no way I could get through more than 1\/4 of it.

Pink Lemonade:  Err it wasn't pink but it tasted good.  Not sure if they offered free refills, part of the service lacking is the noticeably absent follow-up on trivial things like empty glasses.

Cheesecake:  HUGE!!!  2-4 people could share this.  I don't know if 1 person could realistically finish it.  Layers of Cheesecake with cream in-between served on a bed of Raspberry Syrup.  Saying this sat 5-6"" high is no exaggeration :P",0,0,0

Frrrozen hot chocolate was okay. I would recommend it only because its not a common dessert, but just don't have high hopes. I love how Caesar's called it ""the legendary favorite."" Barney Stinson would not agree.  Its a bowl of chilled hot chocolate with a TON of whip cream on top and sprinkled with flakes of chocolate. That honestly describes it. Nothing special about it except for its height and price tag. Its $11 for a small and $15 for a large ""for two to share"". And FYI the large is perfect for three people, especially if your eating a meal here.

Pesto Italian Pizza has a wonderful crispy crust, but it really lacked flavor. I'm assuming if pesto is part of the title then it would at least taste like pesto, but oh was I wrong.

In and out does better burgers. Sorry, but I had to say it. Although you get a thick cut of beef patty, someone needs to tell them that quantity does not beat quality. The bread tasted old and it was soggy. My friend ended up eating it as an open face sandwich. The fries, on the other hand, was delicious. It was crispy and had a perfect golden yellow hue.

The hot dog was just....a hot dog.

I think Paris Hilton made it famous by having their overpriced dessert, and that alone should have told me that it is going to be a bad experience.

As others have also posted, we had reservations and were on a time crunch for a lunch break between meetings, which is why we made reservations. We had about an hour and a half to eat before my wife had to return to her conference. Well after waiting 45 minutes to be seated after the time our reservation was set for, and then another 15 minutes for our server to show up, we made the mistake of ordering.

Well, my wife did not get to eat because the food took so long and she had to return to her conference. I stuck around for our server to finally re-appear and had them box up our food, which never made it to our table. 

After all that the food and fries were less then average and not worth the time, effort, or money it took to get them. There are a hundred better places to eat in Vegas, don't be fooled by this place!",3,0,0

I ordered a chilli cheese hot dog, ehh, i think it is something anyone can make and the chilli was not even that good.  The bread was good though, tasted like it was freshly baked and had that lightly toasted texture.  

Ordered a giant breakfast after a night of drinking- everything should taste good right?  But I felt it was just average for a pricey breakfast.  

Basically nothing special about their food, but they are big portions and can be shared with 2 people.  So, in a way you are paying for what you get- half the price for half the taste quality.

Also tried the original frozen hot chocolate-it's good, no doubt, but for $11, I can make this or get it cheaper elsewhere.  Sounds fancy, but really it's just a frozen chocolate drink! That's it!  

Tried the frozen green tea hot chocolate-bad idea!  Too sweet and tastes nothing like green tea.  Artificial.  Overpriced.  Nothing special.",1,0,0

If the weather permits, I would advise sitting outside because it's stuffy and uncomfortable inside. It was literally like walking into a sauna and we all opted to wait 15 extra minutes for an outside table (it was a nice day so, naturally, the patio had a longer wait). 

Our server was really good as it was pretty crowded and I saw other people having issues with getting served. In fact, one couple got up and left after sitting there for 20 minutes without even having drinks on the table. With that being said, this place is probably hit or miss with service and we happened to be some of the lucky ones. Too bad I can't remember our server's name, otherwise I would totally recommend him! 

The food was actually pretty damn good. I would recommend the grilled cheese with tomato basil soup and the crab cake sandwich. Those were the winners at our table. My dad had a steak sandwich which he really enjoyed except he said it needed some kind of sauce. You can't have a steak sandwich with no horseradish sauce! All they had in their kitchen was A1, so that was a bit disappointing but he did say the meat was cooked perfectly and very tender. The desserts were epic, of course, and we could only eat about a fourth of the portions (out of the five of us, we ordered 4 desserts). BUT, they were all delicious so I would definitely come back here JUST for the world famous desserts. 

I gave three stars because of the seemingly shoddy service that we, luckily, weren't apart of and also because they really need better ventilation inside. Otherwise, it was a good time!",0,0,0

Seriously though, it gets pretty busy especially on the weekend, but they accommodate. Plus there's a curbside\/takeout option if you don't feel like waiting. If anything -- at least try the frozen hot chocolate!

We opted for dine-in and we (10 ladies) were accommodated pretty quickly. Side note: you must wait to be seated. Some lady was trying to save the table that had just been cleared for us, and she was politely asked to wait in line.

The interior is bright and cheery -- good place for families with young kids, group of ladies on a Bach party, or mom-daughter time.

Our server was Dean and he was very charming and helpful. He made great suggestions for other fun venues to hit up.

Came here with a party of about 7 or 8 on a Sunday morning.  We were told to wait, i forgot exactly how long, but we waited longer I remember.

Still waiting for our drinks though.  The frozen hot chocolates were good, but not the best thing I've ever had.  

About an hour later we're still waiting for our food.  I had to flag down our waitress and ask her what's up.  She said it was taking long because we ordered our burgers well done! Yea, cuz that takes an extra 45 minutes on the grill!  When the food finally comes out I remember some of the food being good, but some of it being gross and cold.  I ordered a chili dog.  Avoid that at all costs.  My bro ordered a pizza, it was gross and soggy.  The burgers and sandwiches were all good though.  All of our food came out at diffeent times, we were still waiting on drinks, and some of the food was cold!!

I was so upset by the service that I went to complain to the manager.  She seemed understanding and said she would ""take care of it.""  Honestly, I thought she was gonna knock off 20% or something.  Then our server, mad, comes by our table and throws our check on the table.  Nothing was changed on the bill.  I told her that the mamager said she was going modify our check, and she rudely told us no.  So, this time, furious, I go directly again to the mamanger and tell her what just happened.  I think she felt bad becuase I had previously complained and she said the entire bill was on the house. Wow, I really wasn't expecting that, especially for a bill of about 7-8 people.

And yes I have to admit we came here because we did want to try their frozen hot chocolate but decided not to get it and got a frozen hot Oreo chocolate Instead (close enough).

After spending $100 I'd have to say I'm pretty upset. Our server Phoenix had the personality of a ..of a.. Doorknob. Yes it's mean but when you have  a server that doesn't even greet you, and first words out of her mouth was, ""what do you guys want to drink?"". No introduction whatsoever.  Found her name on our receipt. 

Hubby ordered the steak and eggs for $27. The steak was about 1 centimeter thick, heavily seasoned with pepper. He asked for egg whites for his scramble and Phoenix said they don't do egg whites... What kind of a breakfast\/brunch restaurant doesn't have egg whites?  

I ordered the corn beef hash, I preferred the sour dough toast that went along with it. 3 bites of my hash and I was done. Salty, watery for some reason and it had a very sour note to it, not corn beef hash sour but lemon sour for some reason. 

Note* we both received our food lukewarm. 

I ordered the caffe serendip, a coffee with cinnamon. Don't waste your money on it.  $5 on the menu but was charged $6. Hubby wanted to leave so I didn't even bring it up to the server. Also I only use brown sugar in my coffee and so I asked Phoenix for brown sugar.. She came back after 15 minutes when my coffee was cold and said ""we ran out of brown sugar.."" Okaaaay, again a breakfast spot that runs out of brown sugar and no egg whites. 

Ordered off the kids menu for my daughter, french toast 2 slices  halved for $8.95, no sides so I Added some scrambled eggs for another $3. At least my daughter enjoyed the eggs. Oh and another $3 for a glass of whole milk.

I ordered the hot chocolate ( since i was freezing) and this big cup full of ice cream, chocolate fudge and whip cream, my husband ordered a martini. Ive been with my husband long enough to know that he likes his martini shaken hard so there are bits of ice in the glass.. and i guess that makes the martini taste really good..for him. But at the same time.. you have to take the martini to him right when it is done, because the ice will melt and get the drink all watery.. no one likes that.. Yes kind of picky.. but everyone has their preferences when it comes to drinks...

I saw the bartender make the drink... or rather heard him..shake it hard and there it sat on the counter waiting and waiting once again for our server who was M.I.A.. It was sooo long that i decided to get the drink myself from the bar counter. The bartender i think also knew it was a while because he kept moving the drink forward for someone to take it..
when i went up, he was nice enough to apologize and bring the drink. Right after that the server comes in and brings the hot chocolate and the ice cream.

Once again, I didn't know what to expect.  I knew of the original location in New York, only never had the chance to visit it.  We had reservations here, and I was open about giving it a try.  Yes the dining seemed all white, pink, and cutesy, but to me it just felt another big name restaurant with too much to offer at a high price.  Service was good, which pretty much guaranteed a second star.

Here's what we ordered:
~ Double Frrrozen Hot Chocolate for two ($18):  Yes, eighteen bucks!  Meh, a lot for whipped cream and coffee beans.  It was good, but personally too sweet to me.  Nothing spectacular as advertised.
~ Deep Fried Twinkie Sundae ($16):  Now this was heavenly!  The ice cream and crunchiness of that twinkie, mmm mmm mmm!  You've got to try it for yourself.  Okay share it, because you won't finish it alone.  But still, ice cream and twinkies... eh!
~ Triple Decker Grilled Cheese ($19):  Toasty, buttery, and a cheese lover's dream!  One bite into this and you'll feel the fat go straight to your butt.  Well, for men, it'll be your gut.  But $19 for cheese and bread, ha!  They could at least put tuna in it.  Or maybe they have a tuna melt that I'm unaware of.  
~ Ahi Tuna Salad ($23):  My friend had this.  She loved it, but bit her lip not once but twice while eating it.  I guess that's what happens with you eat something healthy here.  

Anyways, I'll probably give this place a second chance, but not anytime soon.  Definitely a place for dessert, but only if you're in the ice cream mood.  Check out the prices and judge for yourself.

My friend is vegetarian and I am a pescetarian and we didn't find many vegetarian options on the menu and when we asked to substitute a veggie patty for the breakfast burger it was ""unavailable during breakfast hours"" which is odd because usually it's a frozen patty that you grill up like any other meat patty. 
 I also learned that the margarita pizza is just a cheese pizza without tomatoes or basil.. You have to add those for an additional cost.

Anyway, we ended up ordering a breakfast quesadilla and an make your own omelette which comes with one ingredient and for each additional it is $1. Overall nothing was spectacular but I preferred the quesadilla which had eggs, cheese, and potatoes with a side of guac, salsa, and sour cream. 

For dessert we had the famous frozen hot chocolate. It tastes exactly as it sounds.. But I imagined it to be more like ice cream rather than a melted slushee with a ton of whipped cream.

For the drinks, we tried the oreo frozen hot chocolate and the regular frozen hot chocolate. The oreo one was alright, but I really liked the regular chocolate.

Before I continue the rest of the review, I want to let people know what they mean by frozen hot chocolate. The flavors other than chocolate DO NOT have chocolate in them. Thus the amaretto version is really just almond flavor and not chocolate. If you want mixed flavors, let them know.

Now onto the experience. The restaurant is a pink and white diner with lots of cookie artwork on the wall and checkerboard tables. Our group of 5 ordered 2 of the frozen hot chocolates for 2. I sampled the amaretto one, which was pretty good. The size of the dual cup seems large as they top it with a lot of whipped cream, but I would say the cup is not much more than 20 ounces, which is unfortunate for the whopping $15 they charge for the cup.

In terms of food, I tried their chicken wings and fries. Their steak fries were pretty good, with good seasoning. Their chicken wings--HIGHLY recommend them! They were nice and spicy, and their was a light honey taste underneath that seemed to come from a primary marinade before they are deep fried. These were also the juicy kind of chicken wing filled with meat.

Overall, the dining experience is good, but since the frozen hot chocolate is the draw, I'd say be careful of having too high of expectations. It's a glorified milkshake. Some of the sundaes also looked really good, and may be of more ""substantive"" value. I still may be back for the wings :P",1,0,0

I recently dined there for my birthday and has brunch. Based on their fun menu, I thought we'd be blown away by their dishes. Wrong.

I had their chicken and waffles. Should have skipped it. The portion itself was a good size. The waffles were quartered and was pretty good. Touch of sweetness and light and fluffy. But the chicken, boy was I hoping for more. It had good flavor but the skin was not the crispy, crackling skin you'd hoped for. I could tell it was sitting under a heat lamp as it started to have that stale bite.

You'll notice my operative word: good. That's just how I can best describe Serendipity. It was good, not great. BUT if I was basing it on their desserts, then yes, they deserve an additional star. They come in these heaping bowls that are big enough for 4...maybe even more depending on your love of sweets.  I'll pass on the frozen hot chocolate as it wasn't amazing like everyone says. So if you plan on giving into the calories, get the Can't Say No sundae. It's just that, you can't deny the peanut butter pie slice plopped atop a mountain of ice cream and whipped cream that is so satisfying.

The service was alright. Not astounding but not terrible, either.  I would say the dessert is worth the wait, but the food isn't.

Mac and Cheese had a nice (as in pretty, not as in tasty) crumb topping but there wasn't enough cheese sauce on the pasta.  It was all pretty bland.

Sweet Potato Fries were yummy, but not worth the $6 i paid for a tiny bucket (maybe 1 cup volume or 2 oz by weight)

Chicken Alfredo was tasty, but again, not enough sauce.

I had an ""adult"" beverage.  I forget what they called it, but I guess its supposed to taste like a Girl Scout Cookie (Thin Mint) .  It was refreshing and minty but not potent enough to be an ""adult"" beverage or sweet and creamy enough to be a dessert :\/


My experience with the to-go window:

I had some friends in town and I had taken them to dinner and suggested Serendipity 3 for dessert.  By the time we got there around 930 PM there was a 40 minute wait for the dining room and outdoor patio seating, so we decided to try the to-go window.  Much to our dismay, that window had a very limited menu and we couldn't order the sundaes we wanted.  The lady suggested ordering at the bar ""to go"" so that is what we did. 20 minutes after arriving we finally had our dessert.

Deep-Fried Oreo Sundae was huuuuuge. Cavity\/Diabetes in a giant plastic cup. Vanilla Ice cream, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and maybe 6 cornflake-coated and fried Oreos.

Bottom Line: I'd come back over and over again for their dessert...their food....not so much.",1,0,0

I say beside Caesar's Palace because it is on the same property as the resort but is located right on the strip. The service here has always been friendly and warm.

I have met several servers and each time I have gone back, and if they're working, they remember me. This is amazing as many thousands of people go through weekly. If the manager is there, she'll come around and say hi and be sure the meal or drinks are what you're expecting. The temperature on the food is always hot. This is difficult for large kitchens at any restaurant but they seem to pull it off.

I have brought in many sets of friends, recommended it to people on social services and all of them have had an excellent time. How do I know this you may ask. They send me tweets or Facebook status wall postings about their experiences. I took my parents here during one of their trips to visit and they both thoroughly enjoyed their lunch, they have asked to go back.

I have had many desserts here, including the Golden Opulence Sundae, which was presented to me, without my prior knowledge, when I hit a certain follower count on Twitter. Sharing it with the 20+ other people at the party was a good time. They brought it out in a Baccarat Crystal bowl with a golden spoon via white gloved private butler. The almonds were covered in golf leaf and there were giant chocolate pieces all over it. People ask if the taste of the Sundae is worth the price. First, you get to keep the golden spoon and the crystal bowl, so half of the price of the dessert is just in those two items. Secondly, you shouldn't have this dessert by yourself. You could end up spending several thousand dollars on bottle service at a club, this is more fun. The taste is unlike anything I've ever had in a Sundae. There are some exotic ingredients in this sundae that I have yet to taste in another deluxe sundae. Some of the food I have received at this restaurant have been comped.

And if a phenomenal, old-fashioned classic chocolate sundae is something you've been dying for, then Serendipity 3 is definitely the answer to all your hopes and dreams!

Our adventure tonight begins on the tail end of our national sales meeting which had me back in town for a week of politics, hard work, and eating! With all the fancy desserts to choose from in this town (each one trying to out-do the next), sometimes the simplicity of just good ice cream coupled with quality chocolate, rich whipped cream, and a cherry top, becomes the most attractive and sadly, the hardest to find.  But if that's what your heart is desiring, then look no further because Serendipity 3 is where you need to be. 

Parking was challenging getting into Caesar's Palace on a Friday night, but I'm glad we didn't give up the fight against a ton of traffic to get to the large lot located at the back of the casino, or working our way back towards the front of the casino to S3 once we parked.

Upon arrival, we were met and seated quickly by a friendly waiter, and our orders were taken within just a few minutes. A short time later, we were pleasantly greeted by his return carrying a large tray of various ice cream dishes, of which mine was the ""Classic Chocolate Sundae.""  Served in an extra-large sundae cup, this over-the-top, bomb-liciousness of pure ice cream grandeur is something to behold.  Flowing over the rim w\/ premium vanilla ice cream drenched in hot fudge, and then finished w\/ a mound of perfectly stacked and swirled whipped cream, the visual impact of this sundae suggested that this night was going to end wonderfully.

And after polishing it off in entirety, it sure as shit-fire did!  (Lactose intolerant pun intended--that too being serendipitous and worth every cramp thereafter).   Without a doubt, one of the best hot fudge sundaes I've had in a long long time.

Will I be back again?  Definitely, and I'm already counting the days until I can once again reunite w\/ that classic cup of wonderful.

If your giving, definitely share this sundae. But I wouldn't blame you if you rather have it all to yourself ;)

The ABC Burger is hefty. The meat patty is cooked to your liking- ours was nice and juicy. With avocados, grilled onions and tomatoes with a slice of pickle on the side. Topping it off with sweet potatoes fries just screams perfect match.

I've been to the NY one which I absolutely loved and was really excited to know that there's a Serendipity much closer to me now.  First thing I noticed was that they have a window by the side of the building from which you can order to go.  I found it really interesting and convenient that they did that.  Although there were long lines, they seemed to be moving rather quickly.

I have to say though, I was really disappointed by my experience with the Vegas Serendipity.  Their service sucks.  When I went to get a table, they told me the wait would be about an hour.  That's understandable and fine.  After 50 minutes of waiting, my friend suggested that we check to see how far along we were.  We go up to the bitchy hostess and she informed us that they had called us.  But our beeper never rang!  And we were waiting right outside their door the whole time.  Another server then explained to us that some of their beepers were broken and said that they'd clear a table for us immediately.  Which was nice except the extra little comment she had to add which was ""You guys are lucky we'll clear a table for you now"".  My friend and I just looked at each other astonished.  WTF?!  The beeper issue is not our problem, it's the restaurant's.  They shouldn't be so cheap and use beepers that are broken.

Still, we didn't let that damper our mood.  We went on our merry ways and ordered a load of food.  (Their menu, compared to the NY branch, is not as long and may differ a bit)  I shared an omelette with a friend and ordered the Forbidden Broadway Sundae for myself.  

The omelette was plain but decent.  Nothing worth talking about.  The sweet potatoe fries that came with it were really good but not so much after you take it home as leftovers.  When our waiter was taking down our orders, he had made it a point to ask me whether I had wanted my dessert after or with my entree to which I replied after since I didn't want to the ice cream to melt.  For some reason, my dessert was brought out with my entree.  When I told the guy that brought it out, he proceeded to give me attitude and told me ""Well it's already here.  If I were to bring it back, it'll take another 20 minutes.  But I mean... I could bring it back if you really want.""  I told him it was ok and he just rushed off.  No apology, no empathy, nothing.  Whatever.  I had a great dessert piled with whip cream that I had asked to be left out.  Oh well.  What could I have done at that point?

Overall, it wasn't worth it.  The food for the most part is mediocre (my friend told me the One-Eyed Jack was bad and that the bread was so hard it was inedible) and the prices are high.  If you want to go just to say you went, then go.  Otherwise, avoid it.  There are a bunch of great buffets (Wynn!) you can hit up in Vegas.",1,0,0

We had saw this place on TV and wanted to try it while staying in Vegas one night for dinner.  I assumed we'd be dining in but my boyfriend thought we were just going to get food to go (which is what we should have done).  He followed with my assumption instead and we ended up waiting for a table.  

First of all we walked in not knowing whether it was a place where you seat yourselves or not.  The cashier probably saw our confused faces then told us that the host was outside.  The host was probably in one of the most awkward places.  The host podium was by the wall behind the ""dinner special"" sign.  While we waited for our table we noticed people kept doing the same thing we did:  walking by the host podium looking confused as to whether they should seat themselves or not.  This should have been the first clue that this place was completely unorganized.

When we finally got seated (after more than 15 minutes, but that's ok), we knew what we wanted and our server took our order very quickly.  I noticed there were quite a few empty tables, about half of the room in fact.  This made me wonder why we even had to wait in the first place.  Our chicken tender appetizer was very good and a bigger helping than we had previously expected.  Both of our entrees were just about the same:  I had a Thai steak salad and my boyfriend had spaghetti and meatballs.  By the time we had gotten halfway done with our entree part of the meal was when things started to go downhill.

Our server was pretty good in the beginning.  He was nice and never really forgot about us until after our entrees were dropped off.  We needed boxes for our leftovers and were starting to worry about making our shuttle back to our hotel in time.  It took our server so long to get us our boxes that we ended up ordering our frozen hot chocolate for dessert ""to-go"" instead of enjoying it at the restaurant.  I think our server got overwhelmed with guests because the dining room was full at this point.  

It took us forever to get the frozen hot chocolate but at least he dropped off the bill at the same time.  We figured we'd just leave cash so we didn't have to wait for him to run a credit card.  The only problem was we needed some change so I thought I could easily walk over to the cashier and get two 10's for a 20.  Wrong.  I walked over to the cashier and asked for change.  She replied that she didn't have access to the register but I could ask the bartender if she had change.  So i did that and guess what? I couldn't get the bartender's attention because she was too busy talking. So I walked over to a different cashier who also didn't have access to the register. Who has access to the cash register then? I then tried to find our server, but he was running around the dining room helping his new guests. Finally I found a different server and asked for change.  She said she ""thinks"" she did but she took forever and a day to sift through her bills to find enough for me.  At this point I was completely irritated.  What kind of place has a customer running around the dining room looking for change?  

Seriously, never again.  If we ever visit this place again, we'll just get our food to-go because this place seriously doesn't understand the definition of customer service.  They obviously don't know how to run an organized business.",0,0,0

I was there for my sister's bachelorette party in May and ordered a side biscuit to go along with my eggs. It came out cold, like fresh from the fridge. 

When I pointed out that it was cold and asked for it to be toasted, the server said ""We always serve our biscuits that way. But I can heat it up if you want.""

I did request for it to be toasted, and then it was returned to me humid, clearly microwaved.

This is not how biscuits should be eaten. Do not get the biscuits here. 

Outside of that element, the group was overall fine with the meal. I particularly enjoyed the crispy breakfast potatoes. Many enjoyed a massive sundae dripping with marshmallow cream and stuffed with fried Oreos.

It was a warm day outside and I decided that I HAD to try the frozen hot chocolate and fulfill my list of things to do before I left Vegas (trying THIS drink was one of the things on my list). I'm glad I did, because now I know. After reading Yelp reviews about this place, I realized that I did not have time and money to waste to dine in, so I ordered a frozen hot chocolate at their To Go window located in the back (other side not facing the main street). I believe it was  around $8.50 (?) for a regular sized cup that looked like a grande chocolate chip frapp from Starbucks. I'll have to admit that it did taste pretty refreshing and similar to a chocolate frosty from Wendys with whipped cream and chocolate chips like frapps at Starbucks (price difference exerts Vegas lifestyle). I liked it, but would not go out of my way to get this again. At least I left Vegas happy, because I finally tried a frozen hot chocolate that everyone raved about at Serendipity's. 

P.S. To Go window does not have as many things that you can order compared to their regular menu, but it's faster if you are on a time crunch.",7,5,6

The food, while certainly not an inspirational culinary masterpiece, was good. 

The service, however, was appallingly bad. And that's coming from a former waitress-I know how difficult this job can be.

Despite the fact that the restaurant was not very busy (there were other patrons, but the majority of them already had their food), we still waited 20 minutes for a server to even take our drink orders. When we told him we were also ready to order our food, he said that he did not take dinner requests; he would have to get our waitress. My boyfriend asked if we could tell him what we wanted anyway, and he was nice enough to just say yes and said he'd pass it on to the girl who would wait on us. I thought this was an odd division of labor, and while we were waiting for our food, I noticed that the restaurant seemed to have one person who took food orders, one person who did drinks (and by drinks I mean even bringing you a Pepsi), one person who bussed tables, and one person who actually brought the food over. Yikes.

Ten minutes later, the waitress came to the table: they were sorry, but the kitchen had run out of the spaghetti and meatballs my boyfriend had ordered. He changed his order, and we waited another 15 minutes. To make a long story short, after all this, the kid who brought the food out of the kitchen gave our dinner to the wrong table. The chef came out and apologized. He brought us a free dessert, and said he would re-cook the food, but the experience did not improve much despite this. We still had to wait at least another 20 minutes, and our waitress was no more available to us than she had been when we arrived-we barely saw her and ended up having to flag someone else down to ask for our check. 

What a mess. We weren't the only ones with this issue; the group of ladies behind us also waited a long time for no reason and also received the wrong food. And to add insult to injury, shortly after our food arrived, my boyfriend spotted a family who had sat down after us receiving the spaghetti and meatballs they'd told him they didn't have.
